The setting in the patio is really lovely. So was the special tomato salad.

The food however was really underwhelming. The clam linguine was so salty, it was inedible.  Luckily my partner does not mind super food.

The duck was well cooked but the pappardelle was not. It was either dry or overcooked. The rigatoni was the most successful dish, though also on the salty side but at least still tasty.

The two stars are basically for the tomato salad and the chocolate oblivion cake. Two of of the five dishes that are worth it.

On the upside: dog and stroller friendly.</Text>< Name>

<text>I have to be honest though that I was expecting a little bit more from the food. Specifically in the pizza, I was looking for really soft and fresh dough.  The pizzas really did look delicious. But the pizza that I had which was the vegan pizza was a little bit too chewy for my taste. It took me several really hard chews to get it digestible. I was also looking forward to the endive and red beet salad, but it was pretty ok tasting, but not mind-blowing. I felt that perhaps the food was being made in a bit of a rush and the presentation could also have been improved.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Food was insanely slow to come out.  It took over an hour for some people in our group to get their food while others arriving after us were served.  Also the food was not as described on the menu.  $12 for 2 plain pancakes seems pretty ridiculous & we were given the wrong food multiple times.< /Text>

< Review>
Had a wonderful dinner at Sociale last week. We ordered the following appetizers (all 5*)- burrata, soup, fig salad, and fried olives. Olives were a little too salty for my liking but others in my party enjoyed them. Main course- artichoke ravioli, pici bolognese, rigatoni, and pappardelle with braised duck. While all of them were delicious, braised duck pasta was the best!
Their beautiful patio coupled with top notch service was a treat. They are also taking required precautions during this pandemic.<//Review>

<Review>First in for most, this is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco. As they shifted to take out, they maintained their quality. This was not easy to do. Their online ordering system is easy and efficient, and their curbside delivery is pleasant and easy and safe. All in all, a great experience at Sociale because of their great food.

Staff was no doubt courteous and professional; atmosphere wasn't bad. Presentation of the dishes looked good. The Fried Olives was interesting. The Wagyu Braised Short Rib was excellent. But the other dishes, like the fish and pork, fell short of expectations. Also, wait time for the food was a bit too long.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPd005PePg_K-wJ3at_j3-BrYRzY3mdV-Va4Yfr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7gWb6s6wMX298z0URHtJPAhH47J7UpzsHR5xu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXlBeMeWV-e6lO6MBYj_KxW3bdLKMHoV5mS2ce=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSDKR3ZDpSaGxJL5eWc8TpwgNMN07Wy87_gfka=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<name>Marco Danesi</name><text>I just recently discovered Sociale and had the pleasure of having an 'al fresco' lunch this past weekend. Not only the food was SUPERB and authentic, but also our server Steve was exceptional and made us feel right at home (grazie mille!) We enjoyed the signature dish (duck pappardelle), rigatoni all'amatriciana, chocolate cake with EVO (so yummy) and a bottle fo Ferrari Brut bubbles from Trento, Italy. Everything was absolutely excellent! As an Italian expat in SF, I can most definitely recommended Sociale and can't wait to be back.< /text><Gmap_id>0x808587316526ca4f:0xca2305a0352285dd< /Gmap_id>< Response>

I love this restaurant and have been turning friends and family on to it for years! Every time they take away my duck, they soon bring it back! The fried olives are another old favorite which are the only olives I’ll eat!! But they have a lot of new delicious starters and mains and their wine list is always brilliant! Very nice place in a secluded courtyard with outdoor dining as well as comfortable seating inside, but true to SF, not pretentious! I will always come back!<//review>

<Text>We've been to Sociale several times on Sacramento and have always loved their food and atmosphere, but we recently ordered the Curb Side pickup service and wow! What a great meal. Our family has been cooped up for a week now thanks to you know what and we needed a great meal to take our minds off of the world. I had the Pappardelle with Braised Duck and it was fantastic. I love the braised duck in this dish. The rest of the family went with the Pici Bolognese and were very happy with their decision. There was nothing left. Highly recommended.< /Text>< user_name>

Great food, amazing service.   It's tucked away off Sacramento Street.   Every time we go we feel like we're on vacation outside of SF.</Review>

Came here for our anniversary and had an amazing time. The walkway entrance was beautiful. Got a table outside. Service was really good. The somolier made a great suggestion for wine based off our preferences. Server was incredibly friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back< /text>

< Review>
We have recently moved to the neighborhood and decided to go check out Sociale a few days ago. The ambiance is very charming and romantic, and I love it that the restaurant doesn't face the street. The area is nice and quiet. I have tons of food allergies and it's very challenging for me to eat at an Italian restaurant, considering that I am allergic to dairy, gluten, garlic and onions. We told the waitress about my allergies once we sat down and she couldn't be any more accommodating. She spoke with the chef and he/she put a seafood pasta dish together without all the allergens and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!! How can you make Italian food taste good without garlic I don't know lol. I hadn't had a pasta dish in years and it absolutely made my day. I can't tell how much I appreciate the kindness and the amazing service. We are definitely coming back. It's always great to find those neighborhood gems. :)< /Review>

Sociale has a  European flair with locally sourced artisan foods, homemade pasta and wines.  Great for lunch or dinner.  I love finding the hidden gems - the experience that makes you feel transported.  Sociale on Sacramento St is one of those places. It's a treasure for both visitors and locals alike.  You'll see the hand painted painted sign with menu on the sidewalk. Stroll down the  cobblestone pathway to this beautiful little bistro.</Text>

<review>Visited from Victoria, BC with our 18-month old recently, clearly not geared towards children but they were very accommodating and welcomed us nonetheless!  The food was absolutely incredible, our best meal in SF and quite possibly a top 5 of anywhere we've ever eaten.  Incredible and recommended!<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
My husband and I went to Sociale on a Friday night to celebrate our anniversary. We made reservations for 6pm, and we arrived about ten minutes early. We were immediately seated and offered water. We chose a half bottle of red (a very good Brunello) to have with dinner and let our server, Molly, know that one of us was a vegetarian. Molly was terrific throughout the entire meal, even wishing us a happy anniversary (which I had put on the reservation but neither of us had mentioned upon arrival). When I asked her preference between two entrées, she didn't hesitate to offer her opinion, which was really nice in contrast to places where you wonder if the people working there have ever sampled the menu. We enjoyed small but very yummy bread rolls while we waited for dinner.

We had a stone fruit and kale salad to start, followed by the wagu beef (for my husband) and the corn tortellini (for me) and polenta fries (to share). Everything was cooked very well and tasted delicious, and the portions were perfect.

For dessert, we enjoyed the orange flan and a vanilla milkshake with a fried dough pastry. Both were just as tasty as everything else we had shared and a perfect end to our meal. Dinner for the two of us, including a shared appetizer, two entrees, a shared side, two desserts, and a half bottle of wine came to about $180, which was very reasonable considering the terrific service and the delicious food. We'll definitely return!<//Review>

Very fun atmosphere with plenty of outdoor seating that is covered and heated. Seems like it would be great in the summer. The food is awesome and the service is on point. In my opinion the best things on the menu are the starters, especially the crudo. Things get busy so be sure to make reservations a day or two in advance.</Review>

I can't wait to go back to try a bottle from their extensive Italian wine list (including a Ghemme, which is a rare treat in California).  We dined indoors, but the outdoor seating looked quite appealing.  The staff is crisply professional and knowledgeable.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Sociale is super cute. I love how it's hidden off the street between buildings. The main room and secondary room aesthetic seemed a bit off... a bit funeral home-y with the thick draperies over fake, brick walls and simple, white paint on other walls. Not a ton of charm on the interior, but the patio was adorable.

Service was spectacular - there was quite a long wait between starter and entree (the server didn't even take our dinner order until after the small plates were finished), as other reviewers had mentioned, but that didn't bother me so much. It was a very casual and relaxed environment to enjoy conversation and good food.

We had the fried olives and the pork belly, which were both delicious. They also serve small, warm biscuits/rolls with butter. I love that they were warm and... well... I love bread.

For dinner, I had the Wagyu Bavette Steak. I was a little disappointed - for the price, I really expected something pretty great, but it was a tough cut of meat that was overdone and had a pretty bland and overall game-y flavor.

The wine selection is pretty good and pretty extensive.

I would consider giving it another go and possibly trying the pasta instead, but at this point, I would not recommend to my friends.<//review>

Either way, the food was amazing! To start, I had the burrata (the yellow beets and cheese went very well together). Followed by the pappardelle with duck (sooo tasty). Finally, I finished with the seven layer ice cream cake (a refreshing end to the meal). I also had a taste here and there of other menu items, such as a the chocolate oblivion cake (a taste was perfect, but I think it would've been too rich for me to have the whole piece). And all the courses were paired with wine. The staff were very attentive throughout, refilling glasses of wine and water, and generally around to answer any questions. Overall, had an amazing experience here and I definitely want to come back soon.< /Review>< Time>

DON'T EVEN FOR A SECOND THINK OF GOING TO THIS RESTURANT.  THE STAFF INCLUDING THE BUS BOYS ARE JUST PLAIN  NASTY.
35 MINUTES BETWEEN 1ST COURSE AND ENTREE WITH NO APOLOGIES FROM ANY ONE. THERE ARE SO MANY RESTURANTS IN.SAN FRANCISCO WHICH ALL MAKE A HUGE EFFORT TO PLEASE.
A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE  !!!!!!!!!< /Review>

The food is absolutely wonderful (don't miss the brick chicken), the service is warm, welcoming and efficient.  It's a bit cramped (and noisy) and the decor is nothing special but it's really a very nice addition to the neighborhood.  We just love the place.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>I  tried to give this establishment a few tries. You can never go wrong with BR ice cream. Employees that are here are hit or miss. Last night was the final straw for me. Read below for situation.

BR closes at 10:00 on a Friday night, went to get my car wash and grab some ice cream. Walked in at 9:48/9:49 but they had things covering the ice cream. I asked if they were already closed and they said "no, you can still get ice cream". There were 3 employees there, 2 of which were not wearing gloves, the other having cash out on the counter. I waited for about 5 minutes with no help, literally just standing there. At 9:56, one of the employees told me that they were already closed and that in the future... I cut him off and had to tell him I asked if they were closed before I waited and that I've been waiting for one of them to help me. The other employee told me "well that was a few minutes ago and we're closed now", which I then tried to explain one of them could've helped me get the ice cream and not have to wait. They tried to back out of their previous statement and that I could order, but that they were already closed due to their computer system clock. I decided not to order anything, and go to another ice cream shop in TO.

I feel that this establishment has incompetent employees as to what to do with regards to customer satisfaction. This is the worst experience out of the half dozen times I've been there. Not very many times to go here and to continuously have problems with their employees.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp><Name>Alexx Robo< /Name><gmapID>0x80e8309f83a5955d:0xb2e2140dc3a79896<//gmapID>< UserId.>

<text>I was so lucky to get such a beautiful  cake here for my mom on Mother’s Day. There weren’t many options but I got a perfect one with pink roses on it. The staff was friendly and wrote on it to make it personalized. I’m so glad Baskin-Robbins is still around and makes these wonderful cakes that have become a tradition for my family.<//text><Response>None< /Response><user>107095814312862539683< /user><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rate>5</Rate><time>1557767080007<//time>< Name>

<Review>Went there today for a two scoop sundae. Served by a trainee that gave small scoops, not the normal size. Been going there for years. I started to complain to the other two girls by moving the whipped cream aside to show them the ice cream but they kept their distance so I left angry.<//Review>< Pics>

<text>I hate to bash on a place when I have decent experiences in the past but my experience this last time was very poor.  The ice cream was fine but I was trying to use gift cards and their system would not accept them.  Normally this is not a problem, but this was not brought to my attention until the ice cream was made and I was paying.  Conveniently a sign was put up after they let me know.  Also the employees seemed incompetent as to what to do with regards to customer satisfaction offering simply a half-hearted sorry and making no attempt to provide me anything complimentary to make up for their lapse in not letting me know.  Breakdowns in technology are acceptable but not breakdowns in service.  Recommend visiting another place before coming here.</text><gmap_id>0x80e8309f83a5955d:0xb2e2140dc3a79896</gmap_id><Name>Grant Richards<//Name></record></dataset><record>

He insisted on re-using a scoop of ice cream from his first attempt and then putting it in a cup instead of a cone as I had requested. I pointed out that this was unsatisfactory, but he wouldn't do as I requested.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

While attempting to stop a leak on an aged faucet we broke both angle stops at our bathroom sink. We were forced to turn off the water to our entire house. When our regular plumber wasn't able to see us they recommended Scott McLeod. The office told us up front that they would be able to see us as an after-hours appointment. They kept us updated during the afternoon and the tech arrived  when they estimated. He took care of the problem promptly, was very polite and obviously skilled. We are very impressed and happy with the service!<//Text>

Just one bathroom drain was blocked, they charged $165 to clear the pipe. They used the snake machine to clean the max 2 ft pipe. charged a lot of money. Outside its just costs below $60 . My suggestion doesn't go with these people. worst service.<//text>

A 10-out-of-10 in every category imaginable, including responsiveness, punctuality, and professionalism. The plumber was clearly experienced and is extremely proficient at his trade. I would definitely use them again and recommend them to anyone.</review>

<Text>My kitchen sink clogged over the weekend. I put in requests for service with three different companies including McLeod.  McLeod's website allowed me to pick a date and time for service. Monday morning I got a phone call that their technician was on their way. Long story short, they responded quickly, were unbelievably professional and easy to deal with, and my sink is working fine now. And the other two companies I tried contacting never even responded.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c337acb349bda3:0x5d7a1107311d80cf<//Gmap_id></record>

They were communicative and prompt. I thought the issue would be much more complex but they diagnosed a simple fix with no pressure for unnecessary repairs.</Review>

James was great! He was very professional and thorough! He even picked up the facet for me as I don’t live in the area. I would highly recommend their services!</review>

Carson McLeod came out to assess the pipe and was able to quote the price for me in a matter of minutes, with different price options for a close off vs. a faucet. He was very professional and practiced all covid guidelines. I felt very safe having him in my backyard/home. He checked his work by turning the water back on when he was done and everything is working perfectly! Thank you for being on time and caring for your customers.</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80c337acb349bda3:0x5d7a1107311d80cf< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

What I loved about the service provided was that the two gentlemen were not only on time but called me and were early. They did a great job and were very respectful and kind. In the future I will call Scott McLeod plumbing before anyone else.</text>

Another great experience! . Carson, one of the owners son,  came to install a kitchen sink faucet ever since my previous contract company installed it incorrectly. He completed the job quickly and answered any questions I had, Carson has a great personality social and always happy.  He has always given me exceptional service. I wish the company did more services than just plumbing and I would hire them for all my needs. I’m happy I found them through yelp. Call and make an appointment. I guarantee you’ll never use any other plumbing company again! Thank you Carson  and  Scott!<//Text>

<review>Jeff showed up on time as promised.  He was friendly and positive.  He assessed the problem immediately.  He gave me two options with a recommendation of what would be the most beneficial. I had a smelly kitchen drain and a sewer smelling shower drain.  He knew exactly what to do and was in and out in less than one hour.  I’m happy that I no longer have the nasty smell coming out of my drains. I was pleased with the great service and the knowledge that our technician came with.<//review>< Response>

I called Scott McLeod Plumbing because I had an unknown water leak in my slab under the house. My scheduled appointment was a couple hours late due to an emergency with the scheduled plumber, however,  customer service was great and they quickly found someone else available and sent them right over, and they were still able to finish the job that same day as promised (that's why, even though my schedule appointment was late I still marked the "on time" box). The guys were friendly, courteous, and professional the whole time, and answered all our questions and concerns. I hope I don't have anymore plumbing issues,  but I would definitely call them again if I do.< /Text>

After calling four previous plumbing companies, three of which did not bother returning my call, the fourth company did set an appointment but never arrived, and did not bother answering or returning my calls.
When I called Scott McLeods I spoke with Valerie, who was extremely personable and informative, and promptly set up an appointment to have a technician come out.  The technician, James K, arrived on time, and quickly diagnosed the problem. There was a water pipe leak in the ceiling. James proceeded to repair it quickly and cleaned up nicely after the repair.
I highly recommend James and Scott McLeod Plumbing. I will definitely be calling them first should I ever need plumbing services in the future.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>It was a pleasure working with Scott McLeod Plumbing, their tech Jeffrey was very professional, came on time and very knowledgeable. One of the drain was not draining the water out to the pipeline in our front yard , so we started looking for plumber and found Scott McLeod on yelp, it only took less then 3 rings for them to answer my all and within 10 min I was able to schedule someone to come out for a quote. Jeff came and check out the drain almost immediately he was able to find out the problem. The drain was never installed to the main pipe line and that why it was flooded, we wanted it to be fixed right the way and he was able to schedule to come back next day with his Co-worker (which I forgot his name, I am sorry 😅) and solved the problem for us. We are very happy with their service and would recommend them to anyone. Thank you so much again for helping us resolve the issue.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Jeffry is an excellent professional, very knowledgable and customer friendly. He performed a clean and sharp job. He responded to all my questions and phone calls. The only thing was that I did not get a clear cost amount of the work prior to be performed. I had the sink cabinet installed by someone else before Jeffry could work on the faucet. Just installing the faucet, it took him three hours of labor, plus installing the faucet, that was a separate charge. That elevated the total pay out very high. Partly my fault for not understanding the process.</review>< date>

<Text>Used Scott McLeoad Plumbing for a main line replacement.  All aspects from quote to install went great.  They used a trenchless technique so they didn't have to tear up my whole yard.  Just a great bunch of guys.  James confirmed everything was working well and even fixed a small drip in my shower while performing his walk through. I have used them for years, and will continue to do so.  Stop shopping around and just call these guys and they will fix your problems!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>What a great experience!! We had a blockage found during an inspection to sell our home. The closing hinged on getting the blockage taken care of (with only 7 days left till closing). It turned into a full repair with excavation. The team was helpful and the repair was completed in 1 day. Cody, Katie, James and Valerie were all amazing to work with! Responsive, kind, and helpful.
I highly highly recommend them! Especially if you have a time sensitive need!
We were able to close escrow on the original date! THANK YOU!</Review></record>

I called 2 other plumbers before calling Scott McLeod.  One of the two was super late and both were really expensive but Scott McLeod was on time and price was reasonable.   Carson was polite and service was quick. I would definitely use them again.<//Text>

<text>Showed on time. Clog was difficult but tech persisted and cleared bath drain. Very satisfied with work and friendliness of the tech. I don't call for a Plummer very often but will call Scott McLeod plumbing again. I would like to open service account with this company to make service even easier. Thanks everyone at Scott McLeod plumbing.< /text>< pics>

Very prompt in sending someone out to help.
The people I dealt with were courteous.  They were not pushy about trying to sell me on having more repairs done.  They fixed the problem and cleaned up the mess. Now I know who  to call next time I need a reliable plumber</text>

We’ve been using Scott’s company for over six years now. They are always right on time and if they’re running late they always call to let us know. Everyone that’s been to the house has been so friendly and helpful we would never use anyone else.< /Review>

<Text>Scott did an excellant job for me 6 years ago. I have not needed a plumber until now. I remembered him and his work and called him up in a panic. I had just had a general contractor remodel 2 bathrooms. I ended up firing him for substandard work and called Scott to see if he could strengthen out and finish the job. He put everything aside and responded immediately. Scott and his crew led by Jeff did another fantastic job for me.
You ask would I recommend him ... you bet I would in a flash with no hesitation.<//Text></record>

<Review>We used Scott Mcleod Plumbing twice in the past for smaller jobs. This time We had a main sewer line that needed replacing. Each and every time we are happy with the work. We get good communication from the office. Great communication from the plumber,Brian.  Fair pricing and they stuck to original quote. Great work. Good clean up after work is completed. I recommend Scott McLeod Plumbing.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>McLeod plumbing is phenomenal!  I always refer them to my clients and today I had a small leak at my house.   Although it was not an emergency, they came right out and sent Billy to the rescue.   Billy was professional and gave me a clear estimate and didn't leave until he triple tested to make sure we wouldn't have any issues!  I can highly recommend McLeod plumbing for all of your needs.  Billy was great and so is Cody, Scott and anyone I come in contact with when I call!   Don't leave your plumbing to anyone else!</Text>< user_id>

I had the opportunity to experience a main line stoppage at 930 p.m.  Water was overflowing from a downstairs toilet, but fortunately,  it was shower water so it lessened the disgusting factor. I called Scott McLeod Plumbing because they are local and their great rating. Brian showed up less than an hour after I called and the line was cleared. I'm not going to say it was cheap, but it's close to midnight and convenience has a price! Everything was working by 11 p.m. Brian, thank you for your promptness and great service! Scott McLeod Plumbing has earned and deserves a five star rating.<//Text>

Carson came on time to add items I had purchased to my shower heads. He’s so knowledgeable and professional.  He added the items and  bid me a good day. This was the second time I called McLeod plumbing in a two week period and from the lady who answered the phone to make the appointment to Carson who came both times, I am one happy person.</Review>

Honest business, I contacted them for a second opinion and so glad I did because they were honest and much more reasonable than the first plumber I called out that was just out for how much money they could get out of me< /text>

I am a single woman and usually worry that I will be taken advantage of when it comes to things such as this.  But these guys were awesome!  The first plumber (NOT from the Scott McLeod Team) was sent from the HOA, since I live in a condo.  They would have charged me $195 just to come out.  I s'pose I lucked out that it was a weekend, so the HOA covered the cost.  While he was here, he commented on how old my water heater was and that I ought to get it replaced.  Oh...and the cost would've been $2400.  But I digress...  The hot water heater wasn't the issue.  Based on my Google search, I thought I had a slab leak.  The plumber agreed with my diagnosis, but needed to send out another plumber on Monday with his leak detectors to find out for sure.

Come Monday, the HOA wiped their hands of taking responsibility (as usual).  They still offered their plumber though, to come out as scheduled (with their leak-detecting tools) to the tune of $425...minimum!  I about fell out of my chair, cancelled with them, and called Scott McLeod Plumbing!  Guess what?  They came out with their leak detecting tools for FREE!!  They diagnosed the problem and gave me a quote to repair it for FREE!  When I asked James (the Plumber) if he thought I needed a new hot water heater.  He looked at it and said, "It's old, but hey...if it's working, then why replace it now?"

I mean, from start to finish, the Scott McLeod Team is the BEST!  Don't hesitate to call them!  They didn't take advantage of me, had me laughing the whole time, educated me on what was wrong (which wasn't a slab leak, btw), and fixed the leak the very next day at an affordable rate.  Let's just say it was less than the other guy would've charged me just for a water heater.  I can't recommend them enough.  THANK YOU, Scott McLeod Plumbing!!  I will refer you to ANYONE and will keep you for life!!!< /Text>

<review>I have used Scott McLeod plumbing several times over the past 10-12 years and have always found them to be extremely capable, professional and courteous. Branden repaired an outdoor hose bib on my patio. I tried to make a simple repair, but ended up with a bigger problem. Branden made the necessary repairs and eliminated the leaky mess that I created. I would highly recommend Scott McLeod plumbing.</review>< pictures>

With talking it through he diagnosed the leak was outside.

Capping off one of the pipes that fixed the issue.
This job could have in in the $1,000’s of Dollars
Issue resolved for $165.

Thank you Nick you did a magnificent job

<resp>None<//resp><Review>Called Scott McLeod Plumbing to check a leak I had in the ceiling.  I set an appointment and they sent Billy who showed up on time and quickly found the problem (wax ring on toilet)and stopped the leak.  I decided to replace rings on all 3 toilets in the house as well as replacing two commodes with newer models.  He gave estimates for the work and again he showed up on time, quickly got the work done and cleaned up any mess made by the process.  I was pleased with the work he did and the price was fair.  Would recommend them anytime.< /Review>< pics>

They set appointment one day after I called at my request and responded in the two hour window that I was given. I had a new water heater installed very efficiently and left the work area tidy! Both technicians were very friendly and explained my options very well. I would definitely recommend this company!! A+<//text>

I have worked with Scott directly, his son, and many of the guys on his crew over the years. All of them are very professional, will tell you exactly what it is you need, and don't sell you anything you don't need. If you're looking for quality plumbing work, Scott McLeod Plumbing is who you should call.<//text>

<review>Let me start by saying these guys showed up quickly, on time, and were very friendly. I had a leaking shower faucet that I had taken the first steps to repairing myself, but after the initial fix was complete, I realized it was a internal issue that I did not have the correct tools for, so I decided to call someone out. When I called to have someone come out, I had told the woman I talked to what I believed needed to be fixed,  and when the guy showed up, I again told him what I believed needed to be fixed. Long story short, he ended up not having the correct tools needed for the job and had to borrow my specialty tool to initially take the valves apart, he then replaced and rebuilt all my shower stems, which didn’t fix the problem, so he started talking about having to replace the entire shower panel which is a $1400 repair. He said there was one more thing he could try before it came to that, and that one more thing was EXACTLY what I had originally told him needed to be done from the beginning. So after an hour and a half of his work and him having to make multiple trips to Home Depot to get the correct tools and parts,  it ended up being the $5 part and 5 minute fix I had originally said needed to be done, but I still got charged “a discounted rate” for all his time and parts to rebuild the shower stems that did not need to be done in that moment. Granted, they are done now, and I’m sure will be beneficial in time, but the repair ended up costing me more than I planned on spending in time and money. As a young female, I feel that my suggestion may have been taken more seriously if it came from a man, so females beware. Again, the guy was very nice, and came out quickly, it just left a bad taste in my mouth that he didn’t take my initial diagnosis seriously from the start.<//review>< pics>

My wife and I moved to Upland a few years ago. We were so blessed to find Scott McLeod plumbing. We can't speak highly of them enough! These plumbers genuinely want to help get your issue solved and always do such fantastic work. I have Parkinson's and I can't tell you how much extra care they show while helping fix any issue I may come across. They are honest and just the best plumbers in the business. We can thank them enough for all they have done and we are customers for life! Hire them and you will be too!!!</review>

Steve with McLeod Plumbing helped us out of a major jam. Our water heater broke and with a pregnant wife and a toddler time was extremely important. Steve came out the next day, diagnosed the problem and installed a new water heater. He even took the time to educate us on how to clean and care for the new heater to keep it in top form. Thank you!!!</text>

This company is awesome. I have used them several times, so have my neighbors and I've been very happy with the work, the pricing and how quickly they come out to fix whatever the problem is. Today I had my 20 year old water heater replaced which was leaking. I called last night they came this morning, all fixed, I highly recommend them, I wouldn't call another company for my plumbing needs.</Text>

I would like to thank Scott McLeod plumbing  for coming out on 03/02/2019. Nick Rossman showed up late that night around 9:00 pm and it was raining the whole night. He was outside trying to unclog my main sewage line and figure out what was causing it to back up sewage into both my showers and made using water in my house impossible. I called at least five different plumbers and nobody was available or willing to come out that night or at least be available until Monday. I have five people living in my house with the youngest being a twelve year old and the oldest  being a seventy threes old who is my father in-law with stage two cancer in his prostate. So we needed a restroom to be usable immediately. Nick Rossman showed up that nigh ready to help and figure out what my problem was. My plumbing was all screwed up and had broken Orangeburg piping. He could not unclog the main line with the snake and told me he would need to use a hydro jet to clear it out tomorrow. He wasn’t going to charge me after spending all of that time unable to clear out the main sewage line. He told me he could come back tomorrow morning at 7:00 am to start figuring it out. Nick was very professional and well spoken. He showed up on time and unclogged may issue got my plumbing usable that night. Nick explained everything in detail and completed all of the work on a timely and professional manner. I found Scott McLeod on Yelp and they had excellent review which lead me to give them a call. I am glad I did and I would recommend this company to anybody with a plumbing issue. Nick Rossman is an excellent plumber with patients, great communication skills and is a hard honest worker. I had a pleasant experience . Thanks.<//Review>

Sam persisted in clearing a clogged kitchen sink. It was not an easy task as there was not a clean out valve outside. The pipes needed to be snaked from under the sink. Sam remained calm and cordial through the job.< /Review>

On Labor Day weekend I had a outside leak. I reached out to Scott McLeod plumbing which my family and I have used in the Rancho Cucamonga for at least the last 15 years. Nick from Mcleod plumbing showed up that day and evaluated the leakage. We turned off the water source and that day came back with the part. He also came back the following Wednesday and corrected other issues. Thank you Nick for all the customer service. Peter< /Text>

I contacted Scott regarding a sewer overflow on one of my listings in Rancho Cucamonga, Scott returned my call promptly and scheduled the work very timely. Scott was familiar with plumbing issues for that area, was very reasonably priced for Jet Rodding Service, and very professional. I will definitely use him again!</review>

<review>New year day, shower valve broke, couldn't turn off the water. Called 3 plumbing services; one said they would text the technician, one had a voice message will call back in 10 minutes and third call was to Scott McLeod service. Scott McLeod Office staff was friendly and said will text Ryan to call me. Within a few minutes, Ryan called back, came to the house within 30 minutes. Shut the water and fixed the problem and never heard back from the other services. Scott Company could have over charged, but was reasonable, efficient and was a life saver. If I could give more than 5 stars, Ryan would recive 10 stars. Will definitely use Scott McLeod service for future needs and recommend to friends and family. Thank you Ryan.<//review>< pictures>

<review>McLeod plumbing had done a job at my home, with the previous owner, before I purchased it. They had a little bit of work to do after we moved in. Since the plumber was at my house installing the toliet (paid for by the previous owner) I asked if he could install my other toilet (I had a new one in the box-since he was there) and if he could look at my bathroom sink (I couldn't find the part to hook up the new sink on my own). He installed 2 toilets and fit the piece for under the sink. The 1st toliet should have been paid for by the previous owner but I think I got stuck with that bill, only because the bill was so much.
The plumber said he would be back to fix a part behind the toliet but I haven't seen him in 3 weeks.
BUT, you get what you pay for. The work they did do was great and I am happy they got the bath tub working. The owner is very nice and everyone I have dealt with has been great. So even though they are on the pricey side, I would recommend them for any plumbing need you may have.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

2 pluses for Showing up on time.I was  frankly disappointed on the price given for removing a cap that was left on a new garbage disposal. for 30 min  work it was $145 . Very pricey no room for negotiation.  I had another home that they charged almost $400 and they did the work without prior authorization. So, be very weary and  try to get prior estimates before calling McLeod plumbing.< /Text>

<text>We just love everyone at Wine Country Vet.  They’ve gone out of their way to help us with the passing of two dogs.  Dr. Kevin worked with me for two years to control my dog’s diabetes.  He is compassionate and caring and one of my favorite people in the world.  Lee Ann, Susan and Becca are the best too.  We’ve had a couple of bad veterinary experiences so we appreciate all of them tremendously. We’re clients for life.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1623431640540, 'text': 'Oh Steve, thank you so much for those kind words.

<Review>I recently switched from my long time local vet to Wine Country Veterinary Hospital and it was a great decision!  I have had one of my dogs in to see Dr Klein a few times and was very impressed by the level of service and care.  They are absolutely professional and extremely caring.  I appreciate that they will go to lengths to discuss options with you and work together to find the best options for care.  They do NOT pressure you or "nickel and dime" you, for the sole purpose to drive up the bill....like many other vets now do.  I love my dogs more than anything.  So trusting their caregiver is of paramount importance to me.  WCVH does not disappoint!  And my dogs love them too!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>What a wonderful experience for us and our kitty. So kind and caring. Buddy has had an eye infection for a couple of months. Our old vet was hard to get an appointment and mixed him up with another cat and gave him the wrong treatment. We were referred to Wine Country Veterinary Hospital by a good friend. Thank God.  His eye is almost cleared up. So kind and loving.< /Text>< user>

< review>
This was a first visit with my 2 dogs, both rescues with challenging histories.  Neither have had great vet visits in the past with previous clinics. This was a great choice for all of us-everyone was so kind and helpful. Dr. Klein was great with both dogs-one of whom is very shy and mistrustful of strangers. With covid protocal, I had been concerned about handing him over in a clinic situation but he was treated wih great kindness and respect. Not only were my questions and concerns dealt with but everyone went beyond to give me relevent information. So happy to finally have found a veterinary practice that I feel comfortable with and know concerns will be heard.< /review>

I first became acquainted with WCV when I was spending time in Windsor. 2 years ago. My 17 year old dog was failing and Dr. Sheehy did all he could to prolong his life.  When it was time, he came to our home and euthanized my sweet friend.   I got a new puppy last year and I knew  that I would bring her to WCV even though I live in San Francisco.  I think I would drive even further for the treatment and service we get there.  Everyone,  especially Dr. Sheehy, is kind, professional, knowlegeable and extremely competent.  I don't think you could find a better place to care for your pet.</review>

My beloved dog Rocky is a handful for being such a little dog. He was rescued at two years old and had been abused. Today he is 13 years old and we love Wine Country Veterinary. Hospital. Both Dr. Sheehy, and Dr. Klein do an amazing job with Rocky. Prior to going to the Wine Country Veterinary, Rocky had never had a thorough physical exam. He can be aggressive. On our last visit, Sammy walked him out to the car, lifted him, and buckled him in without him batting an eye. You will never know the depth of my gratitude for the excellent care and follow up Rocky gets from Wine Country Veterinary Hospital. Stay tuned for the adventures of Rocky the Dog where are you will definitely have a part in our story.< /Text>

The entire visit was handled with exceptional care, thoroughness, and genuine interest and delight in Maxwell.  I would highly recommend!</text>< pictures>

Wine country called & complained to my sister who referred me. We then got into a fight about it. I can't believe a company would be this petty & unprofessional over a review that they asked me for in the first place. I will not be bullied into giving a 5 star review when they didn't deserve/earned it. I checked my spam & call history before I left the review to make sure. I got the email about asking me for a review so clearly I'm getting my emails.

They deserve a 1 star for being unprofessional in my opinion but I'm not petty. Honestly Kevin sheehy is five star 🌟 DVM. He's the reason I left & am keeping the initial review and rating. Also the staff that came out to talk to me were super friendly & nice. People behind the desk acted like me asking a question was such a bother. Ultimately 7 phone calls and two emails no response. After I left a review that wasn't five stars I get a response....

This is for the owner: you called my sister my wife. Clearly you didn't bother to find out who I was or the situation before you thru out a generalized response. You can't say you gave me all the info by telling someone else. It's not her responsibility it's yours. I also asked for all the info in writing for my records but this seems to be too much effort this company.

They'd rather tell me verbally rather then taking the time to print something out. I can log on and see all my test results from my doctor yet when I ask for the blood work I'm told it's fine. Lastly do you honestly think I'd come back after what your company did?

Initial review 7-29-20
The vets are amazing. Do really good work. Everything there is expensive but you are paying for top quality. Kevin sheehy did an excellent job on the umbilical cord hernia surgery. The only reason I couldn't give them a five star is the staff. They never explain anything. I walked out of their with more questions than when I came in. I've asked repeatedly for copies of bodhi's records. Never got a quote on the other surgeries he needs.

They don't bother to explain anything or answer health questions. The care instructions made no sense. They put together a horrible explanation of the surgery from the dogs perspective. Overall, you shouldn't have to feel like your pulling teeth just to get any information.</Review>< Pics>

Thank you Dr. Jessica Klein, and the vet techs and staff that cared for my dog Bella. You are all amazing and I am very grateful. My dog was attacked by a vicious dog while we were out on a walk about a month ago. I took her in to Wine Country Vet hospital immediately and Dr. Klein took care of her wounds. Dr. Klein was very thorough and took the time to explain the extent of Bella's injuries, and was also proactive in taking photographs of the bite wounds, and documenting everything, in case I needed it as evidence. The follow-up care was also great, and I appreciate how friendly all of the staff is. It's really nice to have such a great vet in town. Thank you!<//Text>

< Review>
Wine Country Veterinary Hospital is absolutely the best vet hospital I’ve ever taken my fur babies to in over 40 years of having dogs and cats.  Dr. Jessica Klein is involved in every aspect of their care and she and the entire staff make us feel like VIP family members.  Her new colleague, Dr. Kevin Sheehy, is just as wonderful.  Having two vets who both obviously love helping animals, and whom we feel comfortable with, makes getting appointments easier and just as satisfying.  Five stars for: knowledge, professionalism, dedication, cleanliness and  having a caring staff, and everything else I didn’t mention here!  We wouldn’t take our 5 pets anywhere else.<//Review>

<review>Dr. Klein and Dr. Sheehy are the best. The staff is very friendly. Our pets are treated like family.

Dr. Klein, Dr. Sheehy and all the staff are such a joy to visit with while my fur babies are getting the best possible care. They thoroughly exam my dogs while giving them extra love and snuggles. For any general check ups, x-rays, hot spot rashes, spider bites or weird bumps aspirated this is the place to have it all done.<//text>

We changed to WCV for a couple of reasons, first our prior vets hospital went corporate and the vet our dog was seeing left for WCV. I want to promote local businesses here in Windsor and all the staff are awesome. They care so much for our dog , the business is clean and up to date, although our dog is very healthy we have never had any issues with getting an appointment.<//review>

<review>The staff and Dr. Klein take great care of our dog Dirk. He is on a lot of meds as an elderly gentleman so I am always popping in to pick up something for him. They care about his health, always ask after him, and do a great job when he comes in for his appointments. We so appreciate everyone there and phone calls are also handled professionally which is a big plus.< /review>< Rating>

<Text>I can’t speak highly enough of this place!  Dr. Klein has incredible instincts as a vet and was able to almost immediately diagnose my cat Duva of asthma, as confirmed by an external radiologist, while my previous vet thought that her mysterious choking/coughing fits might be indicative of pneumonia, cancer, or even FIP.  I was hugely relieved and now, with the help of an inhaler, Duva is a top-notch breather!!  Dr. Klein also treated my rabbit and from what I understand, she treats many other exotics, which is quite rare.  All of the technicians and receptionists I interacted with were kind, intelligent, and really seemed to love their jobs.  The prices were reasonable and well worth the quality of care.  I am moving out of state soon and will miss this place!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

There aren't enough superlative terms to express the tremendous respect and admiration I have for Dr. Klein. She is simply the BEST partner I could imagine to entrust with the care of my beloved pets.  When I moved to Sonoma County 4 years ago, one of the biggest downsides was losing the long-term relationship I had with my veterinarian in the Midwest.  I continued to look for someone with whom I could share the same type of rapport, and knew I'd found our "forever vet" when I met Dr. Klein.  She has all the qualities I would ask for in an ideal veterinarian:  Professional expertise, compassion, excellent communication, follow-up, empathy, kindness, and a wonderful sense of humor.

We were referred to Dr. Klein at a critical point in our cat's care.  We wanted to have the option of in-home euthanasia if it became necessary, and Dr. Klein was willing to provide this compassionate service.  She took the time to thoroughly evaluate our situation, and made an appointment for a house call the same day.  She even made the extra effort to secure a special medication that she didn't have in stock, in case we needed it.  As it turns out, it was time to say goodbye to our cherished girl, Magnolia Mae.  Although it was one of the most difficult things I have ever done, it meant everything to know that Dr. Klein understood our special bond and did everything she could to make Magnolia's transition as perfect as something so heartbreaking could be.  She was incredibly patient, giving us the time to cope with the decision.  Once we decided to move forward, she thoughtfully attended to every detail.  I can't say enough to express my gratitude for her loving treatment of Magnolia Mae.  It meant the world to us.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I absolutely recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a veterinarian! I was running out of options looking for a vet that took guiena pigs and at the last minute on a Saturday of all days, they were able to squeeze in an appt for my sick girl Trixie. They took great care of her! I felt welcomed as soon as I walked in thru the door. Dr. Klein and staff went above and beyond to meet the needs of not only Trixie but for me too! I absolutely appreciate them even more for going out of there way for me. They were through about medications and diagnosis and steps to take for Trixies health. Unfortunately, a couple days later after visit, my girl Trixie passed away and Wine Country Vet was there for me again, to help with arranging to get my guiena pig cremated and back too me in a quick timely manner. The wonderfully sweet woman sitting at the front desk looked busy on the phone, had few couple ppl waiting to get there pets checked in and she stopped her day and validated my hurt I had in my heart having to hand over my Trixie to her and was consouling me thru that difficult time. I absolutely appreciate that moment. Wonderful place with wonderful animal loving ppl. I'm Soo very grateful to have found them!!<//review>< pics>

Upon discovering that he’ Moved - I set out to find Dr Sheehy again. My boy is due for booster shots & more & we’ll see y’all soon! How can I give a 5-star review when we haven’t been in yet? Dr Sheehy is THAT GOOD. And I know he wouldn’t be serving animals anywhere he wasn’t surrounded by people who care as much as he does.☺️ Looking forward to meeting everyone, Jamie<//review>< Pics>

Dr. Klein and staff have been so helpful with my cat Archie!  They are always able to get me an appointment on the same day, and work through the many options available for his care.  The new office feels very state of the art yet still comfortable.  I don't feel pressured to make expensive decisions, but do feel empowered to make the right decision for Archie.  Thanks Dr. Klein and everyone at Wine Country Vet.  I'm so glad you are in Windsor.< /review>

She never came off as arrogant or impersonal, and she never pushed for additional tests or unnecessary procedures like other vets I had seen before.

Dr. Klein is not only an amazing veterinarian, she is a fabulous person. I feel honored to have met her several years ago and am glad to support her new practice.  I recommend her highly to all my friends in the area. She is truly is one-of-a-kind talent and doctor.</review>< pictures>

This was a first visit for Tisza and it was most enjoyable.  Dr. Klein was so professional and loving.   Lee Ann gave us tips on potty training and after a day it worked. Thanks Lee Ann. Melody thank you for the attention given Tisza even clipping her nails. Tisza very much loved her visit!!!!  Thank you again to the entire staff.</Review>

Dr. Klein has the compassion, intelligence, and temperament one should look for in a vet. She is genuinely amazing at her job and takes her roll as a leader in the community seriously. My pets and I are truly blessed to have her in our lives!<//text>

I didn't know how unhappy I was with our longtime vet until we went to see Dr. Klein. I knew we were never in love with the vet we had been going to for over 10 years, but I didn't think it was a big deal. We decided to get a second opinion from Dr. Klein on our old dog who has been very sick. After seeing Dr. Klein I realized that I shouldn't have settled for just an okay vet all those years because having someone so compassionate and informative makes an incredible difference. I was a blubbering mess talking about the possibility of having to put our dog down and she was extremely comforting and supportive while offering advice. I felt like she really listened to my concerns and explained everything as she was doing it. The other staff members I came into contact with were also very friendly and compassionate as well. Our pooch may not have very much time left, but we will be taking him to Dr. Klein for the remainder of his visits and if we ever get another dog in the future we will be taking him/her here as well.</Review>

I brought her in to Dr Sheehy and he was so kind and knowledable! He discovered several things the other Vet didn’t and gave me the right medications for her infections. The next day after giving her the recommended treatment, she was feeling better and began purring all day :)
I trust Dr Sheehy and I’m confident little Cleo is in great hands. Thanks Dr Sheehy!</Text>< pics>

Parents of a friend from awhile ago owns this place. Was told about their Hikaru Bento and had to try it. Definitely wish I had not nigiri or sashimi instead of the comes fish. Maybe they can substitute if you ask. Not sure if it's the same every time either. Overall though it was really good. I never questioned the pricing while I was eating.<//Text>

<Rating>2</Rating><Text>We have eaten at this restaurant for many years...way back when it was Jubee's.  Due to the pandemic, today I purchased take-out for my daughter's birthday; she has loved the place since she was a young child.  Today her nineteenth birthday was ruined because our meals had NO salads in them.  We got just meat (teriyaki and rice).  I was furious.  Along with helping my kid enjoy her birthday, we thought we would be helping the business.  Not again will we order take out from this restaurant; we may not eat at the place again.  I spoke to the owner and while she seemed nice, I just do not think she understood the extreme disappointment her business's derelict caused us. Sure make money, but be much more conscientious about serving your customers.< /Text>< pictures>

All the sashimi are so fresh and yummy !!!!

Friendly staffs, very good Japanese family owned business with fair price.

Best if you sit at the sushi bar and order the fresh / live items of the day. Sometimes it will get pricy since it's market price, but you can always tell them if you have a budget or your preference of the fish and they will arrange for you. You can also order 1 by 1 unlike some places that only allow you to order omakase at sushi bar.</Text>

Decent Japanese restaurant. My group ordered a big sushi boat and a bunch of other items. I chose the sukiyaki don. The fish is pretty good and the sushi was a favourite among the group. The rice bowl could've been better. Staff weren't that attentive. We tried getting the attention of two waitresses who were chatting with each other and the person who helped us in the end was a waitress taking an order for another table< /text>

Fresh, traditional sushi. Ask the chef what they recommend today. There are specialties which are not on the menu. The hamachi kama was perfect.< /Text>

Finally tried this sushi location and glad we did. Ordered 2 hikaru bento boxes ($80/bento - June 2020) for our wedding anniversary.

Ordered to go and it came with a paper guide with chef recommendation order (missed one letter (b in the picture) but that’s not a big deal - I am curious though in where it would be placed in the order.

Bento box was portioned into 4 sections - white fish and seaweed salad, nigiri 🍣 set, chirashi set, and cooked fish/crab.

Also came with an egg custard and matcha pudding.

Definitely would recommend. Looking forward to trying items from their regular menu in the future.< /Text>

We had to call to make reservation for lunch even before the restaurant was opened. After we got there, the restaurant was quickly filled up. The Sushi boat (2-person) was big enough to feed 3 female adults and best value. We also ordered other stuff to go with it.

We ate spicy tuna, pepper salmon and caterpillar sushi.. Good choice.. The Wasabi with soy sauce completed the taste... Well definitely be coming back</Text>

Got the boat. 2 orders for 3 people. Tempura shrimp was precooked, not fresh at all. I like that the waiters speak Japanese. A lot of sushi restaurants in the area skimp on tuna quality, but it's above average here. Service is average.<//Review>

I love the sushi here. I picked up a take out this evening for Mother's day. The restaurant was rockin' to-go orders.

It looked like all hands on deck for them.

While I waited for my order, I was really impressed with how the entire family and staff worked together and communicated with each other to get food served out.

I know that this was the everyday norm pre-pandemic, but I haven't been out to pick up food on a busy day like this in...months? So I was thoroughly entertained to see teamwork in action!!

Plus, the quality here is always worth the wait!

Sushi was super fresh. The chef goes to the fish market predawn to select himself.  Very rare.  He is an old school chef.< /Text>

<text>We only had the Nigiri here, and it's always fresh. There's a good variety, from Mackerel to Amberjack to Sea bass. This is the only place for us around here as we trust the integrity of the owner because of freshness of the fish...Please keep up the standard Sushi Koshu. Good fresh sushi place is hard to find without having to taste day old fish at most places before you can find one.</text>< Pics>

But take joy in that these are the same owners that brought you "Little Tokyo" in San Dimas.

Now back to the review. This review only deals with the sushi bar as I have never actually sat and ate from the dining room menu.

Basically the only reason that I'm giving this 4 and not 5 is the fact that there is no set way of waiting for a table. The waiting area is only 2 chairs and that's it. Patrons desiring to sit at the sushi bar are then directed to sit in the dining area tables. Well that sounds all well and good until a party of 5 comes in and you are then made to get up and move to another table. After doing this 3 different times (!) , the frustration started to manifest itself.

However the food was fantastic and quickly put the circus of waiting out our minds. Traditional favorites are always served fresh and tasty here. But my recommendation would be to let the chefs go out on a  limb and serve you something that they "just came up with". Good Eating!!!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Servers are nice, the place gets busy so expect a wait unless you reserve a table. I would recommend the sushi bar if you don't have kids, I feel like it's sort of a waste of Tomi-San and his sons sushi skills to have kids sitting there instead of a paying customer (personal opinion though).</review>

Best mom and pop Japanese restaurant in the area! The staff is predominately Chinese due to the area, but the younger staff is super friendly. Hisae and Tomi have been at this for years and do their best to leave you satisfied with their food.</Review>

Food is great... Awful, awful service.  Will not come back again.  Tip for the owner, train your staff!  A little smile, and greet the customers.  That's called customer service.

** Bathroom did not have any soap.  I wonder about those hands that made our sushi...<//review>

Slow and condescending service. On a Friday night, not busy, got seated within 2 mins. That's where the good service ended. It took exactly 40 mins to get the food 2 rolls. I was ready to pay for my drink and walk away to another restaurant. Then I had to remind the waitress about my last order. Another 15 mins. I had enough of this place. Never going back. Tables we're dirty, menus were dirty. The waitress cleaned dirty tables, handled money then turned around and served people's meals. Yuck.< /Text>

Omakase is the way to go.  Koshu senior makes some killer sushi and Koshu junior is not slouch either.  Either one will make for rich dining experience.  Though senior might offer candied grasshopper for you to eat.  One of the most spectacular sushi experiences I've had is the tuna three ways.  Seared tuna, Otoro, and tuna cheek.  Delicious!< /Text>

Waited over an hour for a table simply because they took forever to bus the emptying tables.  9 available spots for our group of 2 were available and uncleaned at one point.  When we finally sat down, the waitress was nice enough, and apologetic, acknowledging their shortcomings.  But after we ordered and got our appetizers, our sushi and entres never came.  45 minutes after our appetizers arrived we let them know that they should cancel the rest of the order and we left.  They did comp. my beer, but it was sadly too little too late.  Too many other sushi places around here to put up with this kind of thing.< /text>

< Review>
We've visited twice so far, but we'll be making this our go-to Omakase spot from now on.

My BF has gone to Tommy-san (the main sushi chef) in Little Tokyo Restaurant in San Dimas for years, and was so sad when he found out it changed management. By chance, he found Tommy-san again when he ate here with friends. And the rest is history!

**FIRST VISIT**

We sat in front of the son since Tommy-san was busy.

The son's English was perfect and explained every piece placed in front of us. We noticed that he liked "combo-ing" fishes together, so instead of 2 pieces at a time, it would be 4 or 5 altogether of different fishes.

- Sashimi Salad
- Whitefish Trio
- Silverback Fish Duo
- 5 Kinds Tuna
- Uni
- Grilled Fish
- Seared Wagyu & Black Cod
- Shellfish Trio

Everything was delectable! The favorite was the Black Cod. God, that was tasty.

**SECOND VISIT**

This time, we had to wait an hour. But it was so worth it. We were seated in front of Tommy-san, and his endearing English was so cute!

- Sashimi Salad: This time it was different because it has something called the "ice vegetable." It looks like beads of water but it's just part of the vegetable's skin. Trippy! And refreshing.

- Sashimi Plate: FRESH amaebi still wiggling around. Tuna. Toro. Salmon. Hamachi. And bombass Tako Wasa.

- Kaiseki Plate: Mini assortment of various cooked goods. Eggplant wrapped in bacon. Seaweed. Fried Shrimp Ball coated with roe. Vegetables. Homemade Tofu.

- UNI: Absolutely HUGE uni. Delicious.

- Black Cod: This was a personal request. Had to have this again. It's just so good.

- Hairy Crab: I wanted to try something I haven't tried before so my BF asked if ther was anything. They presented this Hairy Crab mixed with brain mixture. I'm not a crab fan so I wasn't appreciative but my BF liked it!

- Teriyaki Grasshoppers/Crickets: This was so amusing. Tommy-san busts out a bucket of this stuff and drops a handful on our boards. Tasted sweet!

We didn't eat this but it just looked so cool. The mouth of an UNI!

They served green tea and lychee ice cream too. We were totally stuffed! The damage was $160 with tax/tip included. WE WILL BE BACK!<//Review>

< Review>
A spacious church, you can take great photographs of your event, just don't point your flash  to the priest, he gets annoyed by it, and don't ask the bride or whoever to pose during the ceremony, priest don't like it either< /Review>

It's a good private school, I went there from kindergarten to 8th grade and I always thought the school was fairly taken care of. As I got older I realized some things could have been handled better on a bigger budget but everything still ran pretty smoothly.< /Text>

My faaaaavorite! If you love veggies or meat you cannot go wrong at allll. Just make sure you fill your bowl up as much as you'd like because it dose cook down in size.<//text>

Food is absolutely great, love it! I come here whenever I go to the mall but today a caucasian woman just gave me attitude and was rude throughout the whole thing. I paid full and tipped. She wasn't wearing her mask properly and she took off her mask to ask a question. Again, the food is great but the woman isn't. The rest of the workers were really chill and polite but the woman was just ruining my experience.<//text>

Honestly they don’t put sauce they put water because that’s litterly what I saw she didn’t put enough sauce so he added water. Had no flavor on top of that had the large plate and they gave me almost no noodles won’t be coming back. Don’t come stay away! Want better food take 15 steps to Thai kitchen. They also have better service just saying.< /review>

< Review>
I am very disappointed with the service I was given today. I purchased a large and the bowl was super small. The man behind the grill gave me attitude the entire time, he gave me dirty looks and rolled his eyes at me when I asked him to repeat himself. There was too much noise and I couldnt hear what he said. I will not be going here anymore and would not recommend it to anyone.<//Review>

Every time we go we remember how good this place is. And remember that it's pretty much an all-you-can-eat buffet for a pretty decent price. Two people can eat for under $20</review>

This may be #1 on my "to eat while in Modesto" list! Don't laugh! Growing up we had an amazing Mongolian BBQ by my house which was my fav. Yet as the owner aged, it got too difficult and thus it was sold. Can you believe that in Jacksonville FL, the LARGEST city in the continental US (land wise), we don't have a Mongolian BBQ place!? Ah! We did eat at GK off Coffee Rd. once and that tore me up for a day or so - so we don't go back there.
It's $8.50 for a small bowl and $9.50 for a large bowl (GK's only alluring aspect is that it's unlimited). But flavor wise, I love this place! I choose beef and load up with carrots, water chestnuts, bean sprouts, and cabbage. They add the oils and I like mine spicy (Siracha!). Of course this means I'm eating as fast as I can because my nose is running, but I love it. It automatically comes with noodles but I always opt for rice. They cook your dish right in front of you on the Mongolian Grill and it's done! It's flavorful and I am so happy to come and eat here! I'm going to try and sneak in a second visit before I head back to FL....
ps: thankfully I've never experienced the rude man everyone on Yelp and FB and Google reviews complains about....and I hope I don't!<//Text>

This place is awesome! They have great selection of ingredients and the price is pretty good. I like watching my food get cooked on the round griddle and the man making it beats the food it's really cool. It's always fun to watch your food get made.<//review>

< Review>
I will never go back I've been a returning customer for a long time. BUT TODAY 6/10/19, I a paying customer asked for a extra noodles because I had got a large Drink and a large bowl which came to $14.00. So the lady put 2 noodles YES JUST 2 in the small bowl that already had just a little bit of noodles to start with.  Then I asked the Gentlemen if he was the manager or owner his reply was ( yes I am do you want noodles or not) very rude he was. So I said you k how I do t want any noodles his reply was ( Fine I don't care) rude!. So then I said I just won't come back his reply ( I don't care don't come back) he knows I'm putting a review on here plus he had to THROW THE 14.00 BOWL AWAY!😎</Review>

Mongolian BBQ, my preferred treat. I can say this place does it for me. The service was very helpful and welcoming. Feels similar to a cafe in Chicago I liked.</Text>

Food has great flavor! You get to choose exactly what you want, chicken, crab, beef, pork, pineapple, water chestnuts, onions, baby corn and more. You can choose spicy or not spicy. They cook it on a big slab right in front of you and get it with noodles, which I recommend or rice. Never leave hungry! Also not a far walk if you park by the food court entrance. It's the first place by the door.</Text>

I read slot of reviews that posted water downed sauce.  I asked for extra sauce because of them.  I was concerned that even though I asked for extra sauce,  it would not be tastee enough.  I was wrong.  For myself this may have been the best tasting grill I've ever eaten.  Sauce and spice were perfect for me.  Now customer service not so friendly.  No one appeared happy or friendly (and I was there before lunch).no it would not stop me from repeat visits,  but I  wouldn't go there if I were trying to impress someone.  Overall good meal with my spouse. 2 size bowls to choose from.  No Lunch/dinner or aye pricing.<//text>

Love this place style of Mongolian cooking infront of you but dude what is up with the staff? Why are they so short and rude? Definitely not giving this place my business after today. Especially to the little latin chick with the many ear jewels in her ear behind the counter, get that rod out of your butt sweet heart< /review>

The sauces are like  colored water and have about as much flavor. They also only put two scoops of sauce actual flavor sauce into the large bowls which is definitely not enough. If you want an actual good Mongolian barbecue place this is not it I do not recommend this< /Text>

The guy had no good hospitality and was EXTREMELY RUDE. He slops the food on the tray and speaks to you very rude. If he is the owner, he should be closed because he has no customer service ethics. Will never come here. I've been to several and this was by far the WORST< /Text>

<text>Worst customer service ever! The man at the grill first snapped at me, telling me not to press the raw ingredients down in my bowl (I was trying to keep it from spilling all over), then motioned for us (no words) to move our bowls to another area. Once he had grilled  what was in my bowl, he haphazardly set the bowl down and just pushed it toward me, saying nothing. He was so rude, I will never eat there again! No wonder the place wasn't very busy. I'm betting by this time next year it will be out of business.</text>< gmap_id>

<text>FOOD IS AMAZING. One star rating because they closed 25 minutes early & refused to even take 25$ for just 2 plates. Could have easily just put the cash in the next day. Understand the register was already counted out. But seriously closing almost a half hour earlier & losing  $$ & decent tip was RIDICULOUS. SUPER disappointed. Ended up eating next door & they were great sandwiches! Thanks for NOTHING Fresh grill & great sandwiches next door!..</text>< user>

<rating>2< /rating><review>I give this place 2 stars. So their food taste great. The reason why I give it 2 stars because the owner is a HUGEEEEEEE DICK! He watches you as you put meat and veggies in your bowl and he gets mad when you put a lot of veggies in the bowl. He'll also throw your food onto the grill which in turn throws your food off of the side of the grill. The owner doesn't smile. He won't talk. He just stands there..... The dude has also coughed on my buddy's food while he was cooking it. He promptly got a refund. I've heard many people say they won't eat here because of the owner. He needs to learn how to run a business!!</review>< pictures>

Mongolian hot plate provided with options to do it yourself in two sizes. I found the staff Friendly and helpful and the serving line was efficient. A healthier option to sustain your body during these cruel and amoral times.<//Text>

The first time I ate Mongolian bar-b-que I fell in love with it. Fresh Grill Mongolian BBQ food really tastes good, but the mall food court noise makes it a less fun meal. The location within the food, close to the exit, should help diminish the sound but it didn’t really help. Regardless of the noise, the food is really worth a stop.<//Text>

The food was good. The man/employee who cooked our food was rude!!  My boyfriend was trying to keep his food in the bowl and he smashed it down. The man said " you are not to smash it down." My boyfriend said" where does it say that" ( they give you all these instructions) He said " I'm telling you." We will never go back!< /text>

Not sure if I'm the only one.. But their customer services is very poor... How hard is it to slap a smile face..😁😀. Not sure if he is the manager, but he is very rude😠😠😠. Poor workers will use him as an example.. Food is great...I'm giving this place a one star because the food was pretty tasty<//review>

<Review>I believe that in concept the flame broiler is a good idea. However 90% of the ones I enter, are dirty and messy, and the food is rarely prepared fresh. Maybe that's what I should expect for $9, not entirely sure. However it's been years since I've had a dish that wasn't overcooked and that was hot when I received it, or a day I've gone in and haven't complained about giving too much sauce away. Maybe it's time for the flame broiler to retire.<//Review>< Pics>

Its good but the chicken bowls keep getting smaller and the price keeps getting higher. This pandemic is pissing me off. Going into 7 months now. *Govenor Newsom*  needs to be removed from office! he is destroying the American economy 😢</Review>

It is very clean and it does not smell rancid like some other flame broiler I’ve been too . I’m very confident and happy to say this is the best flame broiler I have been too!!!

<Review>I don’t understand why it says they close at 9 but twice I went in, and they refused my service and said they close @ 8:30. I love flame broiler but that’s so frustrating. It makes me not want to go there anymore.<//Review>< Pics>

I'm a fan of the bowls here, and the sauce is yummy - definitely . I have never been given an incorrect order, and everyone has usually been very nice. Great for a quick lunch or an easy dinner.< /Review>

Customer service was lacking and the cook was just rude. Made me feel awkward ordering my food. Tustin has other locations of this franchise seem to appreciate my business which is where I'll go next time.</review>

Better than expected, the feel of the place is like the old store with better prices. Not thrilled by the staff, not the vibe of this area. I'll probably shop here for some stuff, but United Market is just up the street and that is family run and good prices too.<//text>

They carry a large section of overpriced organic produce, some great meat selections, if you're willing to pay more than average butcher pricing and a limited selection on almost everything. The reason I gave this store 3 stars instead of less is due to the impeccable customer attention and service. Not a fan of the store itself, but the employees make it better than it should be.<//text>

Update: they were bought it by Safeway. The results of which include sacking many employees and turning it into the second Safeway within a mile.

Great little market, priced decently, friendly staff. Layout is a bit odd but it seems more an issue with the building itself. Will definitely be making this a semi-regular "walk-to" spot!< /text>

It's a great little store. The staff has to work really hard to try to cram in all the choices people want, so it's challenging. More for them, I think, but if you tend towards claustrophobia, don't go when it's busy.<//text>

Love this market. Andronico's is the only market (that I know of) carries my families favorite ice cream. It's s long drive from Petaluma to San Anselmo, but so worth it. They carry quite a few items I only remember seeing in Italy, so I am very happy I found this jewel of a store. Many thanks to John for ordering my icecream through the distributor. John is extremely friendly, helpful and dependable. Appreciate that!  I am very happy to support our local businesses in Marin.</review>

For the third consecutive time that I shopped at Andronico's there were 3 mistakes at the register when I checked out, and all 3 were to my disadvantage. The produce and meat that I bought was incorrectly priced and did not reflect a sale price. Also, they used the wrong code in for sprouts at $2.99 and charged me $6.99 for some type of exotic onion.
I will not go back and I advise every customer to carefully check their bill for mistakes.  DO NOT TRUST THEIR COMPUTERS!!!< /review>

Third time out for a turkey and cheese sandwich on WHITE (they list it as a bread on the sign) and they offer up the sliced french bread.  Light in color but NOT white bread.  The first time I was there, the person behind the counter forgot to make my sandwich.  Hmmm.  Too new???<//Text>

<rate>4</rate><Review>Previously Guasco's, then Andronico's, now Safeway with more unusual selections than a typical Safeway----like the typical one about 500 yards away at the Red Hill Ctr.  If you want different options, this might be the store for you.  First right as you get on to Center from the Hub.<//Review>< pictures>

Delicious fresh milk and great customer service. They offer samples and have no problem if you want to try them all. It was a great little experience in trying all flavor they offer. The new coffee creamer is amazing.< /review>

<text>Stopped in to buy some fresh milk and ice cream.
The dairy store has lots of snacks and candy to choose from also a large selection of flavored milk like horchata, strawberry, egg nog. I also purchased a glass milk bottle holder. Got a flyer for the farm tour which we will check out next time.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNn9HgvQS5Ue0N90ehmZUXf1zxMh-7g2K8nudAw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnDJwElDJxo19dl-mDSCN0RsEL4_fuh2nEPBSA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVKOG8aGzxyg8Akvv32mOg0L9YqL3VCL2BBuf2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2MBPsg2JD8ixDTNHNgfydLUVM7iTjMlKW3uIU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNS-Wn9ASiyiXkjEwfHE5y1VygkfYtwqIO4jxlH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtwcgtmGDSVsW_dNMVMhd0f_3Nie8i2yaLqMBF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80952b4242dd4489:0x9d6734dad2af1951</Gmap_id></record>

If I could give this company 100 stars I would. They are beyond amazing, their customer service is great, their products are great and their company is just great! I ordered the 12oz milk bottles for my wedding and the company met me at a business so I wouldn't have to drive all the way down there to pick them up. The office ladies are amazing i ordered, then re ordered and then reordered again and they were so patient with me. I love this company.< /Text>

I was allowed to sample all the milk flavors and I was genuinely very impressed with the flavors. I bought a chocolate milk, vanilla, banana, regular, and Strawberry
. The Strawberry milk was a blast of childhood nostalgia. I cannot wait for you guys to come to LA to distribute the great milk. Thank you very much for the milk samples. Thanx from West LA< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>I've come across this milk in my local Grocery Outlet. I've disliked milk all my life mainly because it doesn't agree with my stomach,  but this looked so good I had to give it a try.  I have to say I'm in obsessed. I've gone from drinking Lactose free milk (so milk won't be so harsh on my stomach) to drinking huge amounts of this milk. My mouth and stomach love it. I drink it any chance I get and I'm proud to say I'm addicted to it. My boyfriend.. same story. Milk haters to milk lovers. He and I will easily spend $15-$20 on it every other weekend just to keep all of the different flavors in our home. I advertise this milk to milk haters and milk lovers alike as if I own the company. It's just that good.< /review>< Pictures>

I was in Tulare and I'm glad I went. My 1st time. I sampled ice cream..milk..coffee cream. I bought ice cream..milk...coffee cream and cheese. The girls at the counter who wear the cool throw back style uniforms adds an extra touch. Next time I'll take my kids. Highly recommend especially for anyone.<//Review>

<Review>I just recently tried their milk from the Bristol farms in Santa Monica, and it's very tasty and delicious! Wish they sold it nearby at my ralphs or pavilions since the Bristol farms is a lot further away, but it's so dang good I'll buy it when I can, thank you for using glass!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80952b4242dd4489:0x9d6734dad2af1951<//gmap_id>< Name>

I am from Illinois and I was in California for the first time for vacation. I was on my way home and stopped at a gas station. I saw a bottle of milk, in a GLASS bottle!! I knew I had to try it. I got the chocolate milk, my first time ever having Rosa Brothers product since it is mainly/only sold in California. I absolutely love it! It is the best chocolate milk I have ever had, and I am sure the other flavors are just as great. I am sad that it is only sold way out west, but it is a great product if you are ever in California!!</Text>

Uses cornstarch and carrageenan to thicken milk and its still not that thick. A way to make a sub-premium milk appear premium.

Add some cream and thicken it naturally yeah? Cornstarch is cheaper than cream so no. Your making 20 bucks off each gallon of milk split 10 ways. At that price I expect thickness with no fakeness.

Artificial flavoring too, couldn't use only natural. At least no high fructose corn syrup.

Whole milk should be enough fat content and cream to make it thick on its own.

Leaves me feeling like its watered down milk with thickeners fake flavors and food coloring. Dont think its worth putting in a glass bottle, just preying on peoples love for nostalgia.

Would like to find a banana milk thats just bananas and milk and not all the fake stuff.

If you dont care what you eat or put into your body or get your moneys worth of product then you will love this milk!

Huge fan of dairy so I had to try it, and I have to be honest with my fellow dairy heads.<//Text>

I’ve never been a milk drinker but after watching a video about the rosa brothers milk company and seeing how eye catching the glass bottle looks I decided to give it a try . Wow ! This is such amazing milk and that’s coming from somebody who’s never cared much at all for milk . It tasted so much different than other milks I’ve tried in the past it’s so light and amazing . This will be the only milk that’s in my house from now on ! I’m also going to buy some rosa brothers ice cream tonight for my 3yo .< /Text>

Omg! I am not a milk drinker At All. However, this milk has changed that. Root beer float, orange, strawberry, chocolate, milks YUM!! And the Pistachio ice cream is the best in my life. Go get yourself some creamy delish milk and ice cream here or in Hanford.</review>

Ok, so like a year ago we saw this milk in Kern at the grocery store while camping. It's a little on the expensive side but let me just tell you.... This stuff changed the way I feel about milk. My son and I became obsessed with Rosa brothers milk. Whenever we go to kern we load up. On our last family trip we planned our itinerary around end up at this milk company as our last stop. I just wish I had made an appointment for the tour. Everything these guys sell is delicious. They also sell a little local meat, cheese and bread as well. Stop in, they'll give you samples of most everything milk related and they sell foam ice chests and give you some free ice to keep your purchase nice and cold. You WILL want to take some home. Orange, banana, and rootbeer milks are our faves< /review>

my first purchase of rosa bros. milk was from von's market in fresno . you can't know my excitement at seeing "glass bottles of milk" in the dairy case!! now mind you, only myself and my husband in our household, and my husband does not drink milk...never mind!! i purchased 2 bottles - one reg. and one choc.  i drank the choc. in less than 24 hours and the reg. milk didn't last more than 2 days!!! since then needless to say i am a rosa bros. milk addict...never mind!! i plan on trying to find the newer flavors asap!!  thanks so much for your product..it's a premium product and the fact that it is local is ideal. please don't change anything!! seems like when we find a food product that's so great someone thinks it needs to be "new and improved"!!  please don't!!< /Text>

My favorite of their speciality creations is the caramel drop latte. They also have great food including a variety of bakery items such as pastries and some of the best oatmeal cookies I’ve ever tried as well as build-your-own toast with delicious, fresh toppings you can customize.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I stopped by today for Yelp Elite Event and ordered a hot Dirty Chai. I loved how many dairy free milk options they had and ended up going with almond milk! Thanks so much for the perfect drink, Raul!

I loved the vibes of the coffee shop and will definitely be back to try more drinks! Thanks so much for a great event!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjgLsks6kWJGQ1UMaQ2TVDfnoO49xWluWrGbMT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmmDXCKkGsayL4RU16IHjl4KJ1v8eK582rFFDw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1_7HAzDkwJvu9wIsim9z4UujjuVTPmG-N6TYJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

This is a cool place for a great cup of coffee. Room inside and out to sit and relax. You can even catch a ball game. First time here but not the last. The good thing is they have more than coffee. Go and enjoy.</text>

< Review>
Really like coming here, my friend and I try to make a habit to get coffee here on Fridays. They're a little less than starbucks but their coffee is very enjoyable. If I was to suggest one to somone new, I would say try the Mexican mocha it's very delicious and not overly sugary like some chain coffee places have.<//Review>

We tried their breakfast sandwich and their breakfast burrito and really liked it! The burritos were huge and super filling. The drip coffee was okay, it tasted like it had been sitting out for awhile and tasted burnt.</Text>

I love this spacious and comfortable coffee house. Great place to meet friends for coffee. Had an iced French vanilla coconut milk latte and it was delicious and better than that big chain’s latte. Got a bag of Guatamala coffee grounds for the office — the most aromatic and flavorful one!<//Review>

Decent selection of bulk teas and cocoas, staff was helpful. The place had a comfortable, laid back atmosphere but I think the staff could use a little more enthusiasm.<//review>

By far my favorite coffee in San Diego! I discovered Ryan's Bros Coffee 4 years ago in Logan near the trolley station. I ordered a mocha 😍☕ I instantly fell in love. I had to tell my friends and family once I got them to the shop they all loved it. From the cozy feeling when you walk in. The always friendly staff I can't get over this place. (2) drinks I highly recommend Mocha and Green bean ice coffee (it will wake you up!)<//Text>

Most ppl would say there coffee good to really good. (I'm a snob and former hi-end barista) the coffee is OK. They did not burn the milk or over extrac the shots. Bean quality is good, baristas..? Well one did not know what a latte breve is...enough said. I did drink all 16oz and would go back so like I said not bad just ok.< /review>< time>

<rate>5< /rate><review>This is a solid coffee provider in San Diego. It has amazing coffee that is served hot or cold. They have a huge bar that serves coffee like draft beers if that's your thing. The atmosphere is really open and comfortable. It is rustic and very cool to hang out There. They get you in and out very
Quickly. Always helpful and couteous. We usually get the pressed version that is traditionally very smooth. Always very hot. They also hold large groups for parties there. We recommend you try it. In the mornings you will always see San Diego's finest there.< /review>< Pics>

And their iced coffees were incredible. We tried the Mexican mocha cold brew and a white mocha cold brew. They were very rich and not too sweet. I ordered to go but this would be a really nice place to hang out and do some work or just spend a little time.<//Review><user>111660262474557348834< /user><Name>Maggie MacGregor< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Great coffee, awesome staff and fabulous Management. This is a wonderful, family-run, local business. I chatted with the delightful Mrs. Ryan yesterday, ( yes, she is the Mom of the Ryan Brothers who are the owners. How cool is THAT? )I hope everyone that lives in San Diego or visits will stop by, it's worth it!< /review>

<review>Not too good, the counter person took a customer that walked right up to him instead of the two customers that were in line. Then there is not half and half offered anymore, that was disappointing. I loved Ryan Brothers, but won't be going again.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

It’s called The Trifecta, and David invented it, and he’s a G-d damn genius. This is the BEST coffee you will ever have.<//review>< pics>

Most amazing coffee and I am a coffee addict. I beleive its their way of making their espresso. They use a French press and takes away from the coffee being to acidic.<//text>

<text>Fabulous coffee make in a way suitable for today's society. No fancy machines, but coffee, espressos, and lattes full of flavor. Plus amazing tea blends too!

Want to have coldbrew coffee? This is THE PLACE. Cold brew in tap that is on par with any craft brewery. And the green bean coffee is a better pick-me-up than any green tea. Yum!<//text>< pictures>

Worth the trip to the Barrio. I attended an event hosted by the shop. They provided a tour of their facility where a friendly knowledgeable staff showed how they roast coffee beans on site. They offer a wide variety of Beverage choices including six or more cold Brews on tap where they use nitrogen to pump the cold brew from the storage. They provide coffee for several local hotels including Torrey Pines Lodge.</text>

<Review>Awesome local family owned. Hence the name. I love the the coffee and I grab a bagel as well. I buy the coffee beans to make coffee at home. I love that they don't burn the beans during roasting unlike a certain brand that has made that their signature. You can actually taste the coffee. I tried the teas as well and recommend the Red Rooster Tea. Great coffee, great food, great people and great service.< /Review>< UserId.>

The coffee is very good. I'd highly recommend the mexican mocha cold brew as for the service on the other hand.... they give blatant rude facial expressions and attitude the second you open your mouth if you say anything other than just ordering off the menu. They act like they have something better to do when IT'S LITERALLY THERE ONLY JOB. Also I'm white and I'm positive that has alot to do with it but anyways.</Review>

Love this place. The coffee is a bit on the sweeter side but so very tasty. Food take a bit to cook but is also satisfying. The location is street parking so you might need to walk a bit. One of my favorite coffee shops in the area.</text>

<time>1407972011671< /time><Text>I had the most pleasant experience with Ryan Bros Coffee today. I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Ryan (Helena) the cafe's owner, who is kind and friendly with such a positive attitude, not only as an individual, however, as a professional business owner who knows all about her coffee and with the aide of her staff Harry Ryan, whom I had a pleasant 'coffee 101' talk with, took the time to sit down with me and share the many ways coffee is prepared.  I highly recommend Ryan Brothers Coffee for the BEST coffee in town!

< Review>
Amazing coffee. They have like 10 different cold brews on tap. They have food which is obviously a plus. Ive only ever gotten a bagel. My girlfriend and i have really competitve scrabble matches here and no one usually bothers us cuz there's lots of space. Sometimes important public officials like to come and watch our scrabble games while they drink their coffee and we just a damn coffee party everytime we're there!</Review>

San Diego's craft coffee. "Life's too short to be bitter." Harry Ryan & family roast the old way in small batches, but also push the edge of coffee making with 12 on tap coffees & teas ( & you can combo those) every location has its own vibe, & a bag of coffee at the airport is a great last minute gift for any coffee lover.< /Text>

<gmapID>0x80d9536b036421b3:0xa69ed2cc462a504e< /gmapID><review>This is a good coffee place with less than stellar food options. I came for breakfast, and there's a few sandwich options that are slightly overpriced. I opted for the bacon/egg/cheese croissant. It was made alright, but not very tasty.

I decided on an iced americano, it was pretty strong so that was good. There's only ceiling fans here, so it can get hot if it's a sunny day.< /review></record>

One of the best coffee houses in San diego with a twist. They also offer beer, sandwiches, smoothies, books, pastries great music and an energetic, smiling staff that you can occasionally catch singing along in an "almost perfomance" style. Great place for a first date or an everyday stop.<//text>

Their whole coffee beans are virtually unmatched in San Diego, which makes their odd hours even more frustrating. Very much worth the occasional inconvenience. I literally just walk in, grab my beans and walk out.< /review>

Perhaps the best americano ever from Ryan Brothers Coffee this morning. I was helped by Jennifer who made a mean espresso and was very sweet when she apologized for getting my name wrong which happens to me everyday at other coffee shops. Glad I bought some whole beans before I left because I don't know how long it will be before I go back but I'm hooked!

Also the location, building and decor is rad. I swear I could sit in there and just look around at the design for hours.<//review>

Definitely my favorite coffee place, I would literally drive across town, and I have, to enjoy Ryan Brothers coffees, teas, pastries, sandwiches, selection of beers, and more.

I am stoked that this place exists.</text>

<Review>Been to this place a total of 3x. Though I'll always support local businesses this spot I will NEVER go to again. Don't be fooled by the rustic prettyness of its brick walls, people running this place are not trained to be human. First 2 times I visited I was treated like a number at the DMV. In other words, no genuine customer service. The third time it was an initial emergency that was to follow with an iced coffee. Emergency was me wanting to use their restroom like that very second due to a bladder condition I have.....(you need a key to get in) Guy looks at me and then points to sign that reads customers only.
I will NEVER support this business ever again. Compassion goes a long way especially when you see a customer jumping up and down begging to use your toilet. I'll make sure my family and friends are aware of this. Not cool.</Review></record>

They let you try all the nitro brews so it's easy to know what you like. Mexican Mocha is excellent.

Wi-Fi is available. Codes given out for 2 hour blocks and can be requested again. Street parking is available with a little effort but well worth it. I've been to many coffee shops and this is a different experience to say the least.< /Review>

<Review>Good brewed coffee and great breakfast burritos. But lattes seem ' thin' and espresso usually tastes over-pressed or burnt. Staff doesn't seem to actually understand the concepts of classic espresso. They pre make espresso shots, or pre- make the foam. Iced lattes are made with their cold brew, not fresh espresso shots. The staff is friendly, large place. Parking is on street and limited.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>Nice place to take a break and enjoy a coffee in a old warehouse with wifi, chairs and couches. Has lots of cold coffee options, nitro and such. The latte is a little milky for my taste but it sure beats most places. They have lunch---burgers, sandwiches and tacos---from 11am. We just had coffee. Close to Northgate market. Great service.< /review>< pictures>

So disappointed. I ordered a cup of hand drip black coffee. It tasted completely "meh." Can't believe It costed me almost $3 for that.  The place is cool to hang out but not for real coffee lovers.< /Text>

And 12 taps of Nitro Cold Brew, I have never seen so many options, Most places only have one or two black coffee cold brews. Here they have Vanilla Latte, Dirty Chai, Caramel, and my favorite MEXICANO!!
Oh, and the food is insane, we where not planning on eating here but after seeing some of the Sandwiches come out we decided to get lunch. I got the San Diego TAB. If you are in San Diego and get the chance come check this place out!!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Not really a place you'd expect a coffeeshop, but I've enjoyed coffee here several times. Nice place to chill out - and Barrio Logan has definitely been getting a bit of a make over the past couple of years.<//Text>

Not really a place you'd expect a coffeeshop, but I've enjoyed coffee here several times. Nice place to chill out - and Barrio Logan has definitely been getting a bit of a make over the past couple of years.< /Review>

The sandwich I had was okay and the coffee was decent.  The area is moving towards being a little less rough around the edges and I think Ryan Brothers is a big part of that.</Review>

Coffee really just mediocre and the barista hardly has a notion of how to froth milk properly. The smallest size for espresso drinks is 12oz, so i ordered a wet cappuccino in a smaller cup, came with 2 inches of burned dry foam and filled with almost ice cold milk.
