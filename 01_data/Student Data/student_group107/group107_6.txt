The best barbeque hands down. Super tasty and good size portions for their family style plates. Extensive whiskey menu with discounts on ordering flights. I've been back multiple times and it's always been wonderful.</review>

J Wilds is basically a bar + barbecue. I tried one of their specialty drinks which is a Smoking Fashioned. It is delivered in a Mason jar with a lid. Inside the jar is a very good old fashioned & a big puff of apple wood smoke. Significant effect on the flavor of the drink.
Our appetizer was grilled brussel sprouts w/ bacon, onions,& vinegar reduction. These are also avail as a side.
I had brisket, choice of 2 lean, or 2 fatty, or 1+1. I had cornbread & Mac & Cheese. My husband had 1/2 chicken with Cole slaw & biscuit. I thought cornbread was better than biscuit. There are 5 different barbecue sauces to put on the meat. Dessert was very good: cake or cobbler.
Place was very busy, staff was rushed but attentive & reliable. A tasty & pleasant meal.</Review>

Such friendly staff and super fast service. Gold rush sandwich was super tasty. Great outdoor eating, plenty of seating and heaters for when it gets cold. You won't leave hungry!<//Text>

I worked here. When covid began, I had financial issues after having to leave my parents house and losing my car. I had no money living at my ex’s house and I spoke to the manager in December of 2020 that I needed to worked as many shifts as he can schedule me for because I was one of the few employees at the time in my position who extremely needed to work. We agreed. Next thing you know I wasn’t scheduled for the next week. Nor the entire month after. I messaged the manager and tried to speak to him in person and my attempts failed as I was ignored by management for 3 months until the finally put me on shift in which they scheduled me 1 sunday either every week of every other week for about only 3 or 4 shifts and in return I was also constantly asking for more shifts during the times I was able to contact my managers and they would say yes and then give me less time and since then it has been another 3 months and meaning the last time i worked a shift was in february and since then they have ignored my messages. kept me on payroll, ignored my availability end of feb, which i gave them and informed them i got a new job and so my availability will decrease and i can work two to three days a week. I have not heard from them since and as of 4 days ago I texted the manager I assumed was still my manager. I told him i quit because I was tired of receiving messages of schedule shifts for other coworkers, keep in mind they hired new people for my position in the time i was begging for shifts. the manager informed me he quit as of 2 and a half months ago. no one ever informed me and according to their payroll i was still one of their employees and i should have been informed and i wasn’t. Horrible Management. In addition, despite the people who i worked with making an good environment for customers, they weren’t kind to each other and were extremely clique as if they were in high school and constantly participated in rude chatter behind other coworkers backs. Nobody should be treated this way.</Text>

Great service! A menu you would expect at a BBQ spot with some subtle twists. Music is loud enough to disrupt table conversations which was a little annoying. Will be back for beers and apps!<//review>

I don’t usually leave reviews but I thought J Wilds was deserving of one last night!

We ordered the 3x3 for take out - pulled pork, ribs, brisket, Mac and cheese, sprouts, wild fries and the corn bread and giant biscuit. I got home and realized we were missing the pulled pork and cornbread. Normally, I would let it slide and not even call, but we were excited for the pulled pork - plus we did pay quite a bit extra for the additional meat. So I called and was immediately greeted with apologies and options of a refund or a remake. I opted for the remake and luckily I live close enough that I was able to be there in 10 minutes. I was again greeted with apologies and the man I spoke with offered to throw in a few orders of their whiskey cake and ice cream for the inconvenience. I was thrilled to have such a great experience and seeing them truly take care of their customers! I wish I remembered the names of the employees I spoke with, all of them were all great as well!

The food was absolutely phenomenal! We bbq and smoke our own ribs, pork and brisket frequently so we know good bbq. The sides were great as well! We will absolutely be back!< /Text>

Good quality everything. Meat was a little fatty, but it is a BBQ place. All freshly made hand-crafted meals and drinks. Check out the smokey old fashioned for a treat. Ribs' meat fell right off the bone. Neat old-fashioned (almost prohibition) style inside.<//Text>

<Review>The food remains really good as are the cocktails. The beer selections was a bit lacking for me. The 2 star review is because of the service. Tables were left dirty despite folks being sent out to them. Requests to move heaters were taken by the hostess, then the person lighting it didn't want to move it. But the real issue is while this situation was in place, the staff was sitting inside doing nothing...except taking shots. Terrible service. I hope it's either isolated or will be addressed by management.<//Review>< Resp>

Went here last night, fantastic service and very good food! I highly recommend the smokey whiskey, what a unique and delicious drink. And the brisket did not disappoint. The out door seating is comfortable and they have misting fans to keep everyone cool.</text>

< Review>
My wife and I had lunch there today. Although the food was good we were extremely disappointed in the cost of the food and the very small portion sizes. I had the brisket and only got two small slices along with a small piece of corn bread. My wife had the southwest chicken salad and only got 4 small pieces of chicken on top. Total bill was close to $40. So if you are hungry I suggest you choose a different restaurant.</Review>

Just tried for the first time via Door Dash! Food was great, the 2x2 plate was perfect for my husband & I. I wanted to try a little bit of everything so this was perfect. We were able to pick 2 meats, 4 sides & 3 sauces/butter (ended up getting ribs, pulled pork, mac & cheese, beans, cornbread, fries, tangy bbq, sweet bbq, honey butter). We were both able to eat a full meal & still have leftovers.</review>

I was super disappointed with our experience here. Covid guidelines were not enforced at all. Employees walked around with masks off or not on properly. Our bartender didn’t know what she was doing, my drink was terrible. And our food came out cold.< /Text>

Great BBQ. Definitely worth checking out. The ribs were perfect. 3 choices of BBQ sauce. Great whiskey selection. Only disappointment was the Mac and cheese. Just tasted like velvetta out of the box. Would be much better with some spices and a little roasted on top.< /Review>

<Text>In June apparently this restaurant rebranded themselves into a BBQ joint.... It wS not busy when we arrived... lots of staff standing around. We ordered Brussels sprouts( delicious, but not 5 stars)we also order smoked deep fried chicken wings... it was dry, no taste... just awful. Our hostess took our order and never came back until flag another person down we ask for our tab. Another person delivered our food, we were never offered a fill up on our water or ice tea. We are grateful that there is lots of choices on Sutter street< /Text><GmapID>0x809ae776aa5040a5:0x3ddb47698c77b8f5</GmapID>< Date>

Welp...I tried. Food was late or out of stock which is fine I suppose, and I can understand that in the midst of pandemic...but the service was so consistently awful it can't be ignored. Zero points for service. Also, avoid the cornbread and slaw. The closest thing I have experienced to compare to the sides is the stuff you pickup in desperation as you rush through the airport in search of calories to sustain you before you find real food. Another member in our party suggested that they should buy the slaw from KFC and rebrand it. The only reason they are getting two stars is the meat was pretty good, portions were small but it was good. So core competency was achieved...but this place has a long way to go.</Text>

<Text>I like the variety of the menu. It’s BBQ yet there are still pizza options if you miss Chicago Fire. The Brisket and ribs are delicious!! A nice addition to Sutter Street dining!< /Text></record>

The grilled sirloin is especially recommended. The meat is tender and delicious. A few side dishes are also very tasty, especially the grilled cabbage and fried zucchini, and mac & cheese is also good.
Will patronize again.

(Original)
总体味道挺不错的，分量也很大。
特别推荐烤牛腩，肉质软嫩可口，几个小菜味道也很好，特别是烤甘蓝和炸西葫芦， mac & cheese 也不错。
会再光顾。<//Text><GmapID>0x809ae776aa5040a5:0x3ddb47698c77b8f5< /GmapID><user_id>116776455558802183304< /user_id><Rate>4<//Rate><Resp>None< /Resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>My husband and I have been doing business with this long time family ran small town tire shop. They try to keep the prices low and sometimes cheaper than competitor shops. My husband can call in the morning saying what kind of tires he's looking for and if they don't have it in the inventory, they call back within an hour saying they found the request and can have them delivered to the shop by the end of the day</review>< Pics>

<Text>I absolutely love this shop! I have only been in twice but each time Carol has helped me find a great selection of teas to take home and try, which has been such an enjoyable experience. The selection of teas to choose from is huge and they're all so unique and delightful. The shop itself is really beautiful and cozy feeling. There are social distancing markers along the ground and a signs about limiting customers and not touching the merchandise to keep things safe. Visiting Old Town Spice & Tea Merchants is quickly becoming one of my favorite shopping experiences in town. Whether you are a tea veteran or just starting out like I am, you can do no better than this shop.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>They must have 18 million different spices here. I'm being a little facetious but for real, they have a lot of spices. They also have a lot of loose leaf tea. Definitely a great spot in Old Town Temecula.< /text>< Name>

Family owned and operated
Following covid protocol
Extremely helpful, kind, and patient!
One of the ladies even looked up a recipe to be sure she was suggesting the correct cinnamon for my mom. Now THAT is customer service!!
Curb side and website sales are also an option.
Limited open hours and closed Sundays right now.<//review>

Super quaint, amazing selection of delicious teas and spices, and the shop owners remembered us despite visiting only once many months ago and wearing masks! We wish it were closer, but this is one of the main reasons we visit Temecula (along with the farmer's market).<//text>

<text>No other place like it in the area. I love shopping here for the freshest spices and teas.  The staff are always so nice and eager to help.  Everything is organized so well.  And the punch cards are a nice added bonus/incentive.  I'm so happy to have them as a local small business.  They have certainly won me over as a patron.</text>< Gmap_id>

I love this tiny intimate shop in Old Town. When you walk you can see the scope of their dedication to tea and spice. They sell everything you could need to add some flavor to your life. I love buying gifts here - you can find something for anyone. I also love to order an ice tea to sip while I shop. This place is great - definitely stop in.< /review>

<date>1565808567141<//date><review>The most gracious service in a charming little shop. Seems more like a little boutique you would find off of a side street in Europe. They will also blend tea for you. I like the taste of chocolate and roses, and they did not specifically have a tea with those two elements, so they blended the Florence with Dark Rose, to my specifications, which was 75% Dark Rose and 25% Florence. They got it absolutely perfect! I also bought small packets of each of those types of tea, and a small packet of the Brittany grey sea salt and the Cypress black salt.< /review>< Rate>

<Review>Amazing store!  Upon entering the fragrances wake up your senses with excitement about shopping.  The assortment of fresh tea's and spice's are simply delightful.  This is a shop that must be experienced.  They offer things that cannot be bought anywhere else locally.  The staff is so friendly and actually delight in helping.

This place is fantastic. They have an amazing selection. I know most people will buy grocery store sized spices, many of which will sit on the shelf for years between uses. With the exception of a handful of things that are daily uses, I’m going to start purchasing my spices in the little bags sold here to maximize freshness. That way items like paprika, which loses its potency over a few months, don’t go to waste.</Text>

This is a wonderful little store. If you or a loved one are fans of cuisine, stop by. You'll find am impressive selection of made in house spice blends, single spices, and infused salts and sugars. That's not to mention their tea selection. You can choose to order fresh brewed tea (limited menu) to enjoy while you shop. Excellent tea selection as well as some gifts like teapots, tea strainers, and spoons.<//review>

Lovely little shop in Old Town! They seem very knowledgeable about their teams, which was the main reason my friend and I went. He didn't know anything about loose leaf tea or what he liked, and the staff took time to explain everything to him. They can do custom blends too if you know what you are looking for.

I just ended up with packets of lavender, chamomile, and jasmine as well as one of their herbal blends. The herbs are very strong, the smell of them took over my pantry! In a nice way though<//Review>

They'll make custom blends and write down the recipe for future orders. Hubby created his own chai spice blend, and adds it to black or green tea. If you're looking for prepackaged soup or rice mixes, they have those also, as well as gourmet chocolate, a spiced mix for nuts, and local honey. Try their spiced hot chocolate mix and you will be addicted.

The staff is always friendly and helpful. If there's something you'd like to try, they can make a cup there either hot or cold. Alternately, they do sell half and quarter ounces.

Adorable setting that feels like an old apothecary shop. Their tea and spice options are excellent and diverse. They have plenty of oddball offerings too, which make it fun to explore. Free samples and friendly employees seal the deal for me. I'm buying all my tea here from now on.< /Text>

Biscot-tea, totally worth it!  Great loose leaf teas to choose from.  From blooming pearl teas to green, black and herbal.  Love the various blends they have.  This place doesn't just have tea though!  Lots of hard to find spices and flavored sea salts, cocoa blended with different spices, chocolate bars blended with teas and spices, etc.  Such a unique place with many items related to tea and spices that it's hard to leave until you have smelled everything of tried all of their samples.  Will be back again...and again...!</Text>

You can buy the tea loose to brew at home later or they will brew you a cup of any flavor they have on the shelves. The other half of the store has hundreds of spices and amazing salts with samples. You have to check them out when you are in Old Town. The women who work there are very friendly and helpful.</Review>< name>

I have never been disappointed with the service, quality, or selection at this place.  Regards of what special spice I need or what tea I want to try, this place has everything.  Their prices are reasonable for a specialty shop and the staff is always willing to help.</text>

The employees here are all extremely friendly and helpful. The selection of fresh spices, herbs and loose leaf teas is really vast. They also sell a smaller selection of flavoured honey, cookbooks, tea wares and accessories.
We will most definitely stop here again when we are in the area.<//Review>

The smell is intoxicating. I was dreaming of things I could make the whole time. If I had a problem dreaming, they had cook books to help. I love herbal tea and best of all, I could buy a cup of what I was thinking about and be sure it was as good as it smells. I got many treats there today including my favorite chocolate, Taza. Prices were just right. I will be going back soon. ❤<//text>

I cannot say enough about this place! They habe anything you could imagine and then some. Everything from premade rubs, individual spices, lose leaf teas and blends, French press for teas, specialty cooking tools, and adorable kitchen decorations. They are always kind and helpful. The entrance is in the alley and you have to look to find it but once you do you won't want to leave.< /text>

Great instructors, my favourite workout! You get to push yourself further than you could by yourself, it's so fun with the music and the variety. Showers are clean and towels are super soft (and sometimes warm when they're just out of the dryer!) Can't wait to go back!</text>

I'm obsessed with Barry's bootcamp and the instructors and the workout. It's pricey for sure but always a good time and it feels worth it. I am always sore the next day and the instructors motivate you to push yourself. Also the staff are nice and the shower products are very luxurious.</review>

Love the instructors at this Barry's, especially Erin! I have been going to this Barry's Bootcamp for over a year, and it's the most intense rewarding workout you can get in a studio setting. One note is that this Barry's has a smaller bathroom compared to Marina/FIDI, so the lines can be longer for the shower in the mornings.</text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Barry's reflects what millennials care most: efficiency. The class sure does get you sweat, but the floor (aka weight) portion pays 0% attention to your body alignment and correct posture. If you just want to work out for the sake of working out, Barry's does it job well. But if you're an athlete and/or want to train for performance, strength, and power, avoid this place at all cost.

Oh and if you do decide to come here, PLEASE save your ears and bring a pair of earplugs.< /Review>< Pictures>

Barry's is a great way to get an intense workout in in a 60 min time frame. I've been going to the SOMA location for a few years now. If you find a trainer you like, stick with them. There have been newer instructors lately and they are not all the same. The front desk and other staff are very friendly.<//Review>

I had heard of Barry's but I thought is it really worth the $$ and the hype? Oh yes it is!! I'm not someone who likes to spend money on expensive boutique/bougie places unless they are worth it and Barry's is just that. I went to my first class and a wonderful front staff showed me around the small studio. He clearly explained what things were and where everything was. I felt somewhat comfortable before class started and definitely not intimidated by all the pros in the class. My neighbors fist-bumped me and it was great. The workout itself is AMAZING. I was sore for days after and my heart was pumping and I was drenched in sweat. I'm not a great runner but the threadmill sprinting intervals were so much fun. The floor exercises were also powerful and the instructor went around the room to make sure we were all doing it correctly. Best part- I could actually hear the instructor and the music wasn't too loud. The lights even helped getting the running off my mind. I honestly can't wait to go back and Barry's... just take my money!</Review>

Barry's SOMA is OK. I like the FiDi Barry's more as it's bigger. There is no parking nearby, but they validate the parking that's under the building.</text>

While the price is extremely high for a workout, the workout I admit is quite good. You will almost always leave sore if you follow the instructor's commands. By running with inclines of 8-10% along with 8-11MPH runs, you are guaranteed to run out breath.

It is a great workout for the full body. If you are looking for concentrated workouts like bodybuilding or cardio, you could do that yourself at the gym at your own pace. If you are looking to do a combination without knowing how to structure a workout, Barry's is a good alternative.<//text>

Barry's Bootcamp workouts are hardcore and intense. You will break a sweat and have a good time doing it. My favorite instructors are Chris R. Tommy L. and Gabby. Each of them brings great energy, attitude, and humor to really pump up the workout. Things to know: fresh towels and face wipes are provided. Water costs $2, so remember to bring your own - you will definitely need it. Avoid eating at least 1-2 hours before class. Pre-order a smoothie to have it ready and waiting for you when you finish the workout.< /Text>

<review>I had an issue with some classes that we reserved through phone, but when we arrived to Barry's we discovered that our credits were cancelled and we were not in the class list, thankfully Luis de Las Salas took care of us! He was able to reschedule our classes even though they were cancelled in the system. Thanks Luis! This is why I love Barry's! Amazing customer service, they really take care of you ! I started going to Barry's with my coworkers, now I go everytime I can, I recommend it to anyone I know! Best workout ever!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

If you want a cardio + some strength training class, then you're set!

I really wanted to LOVE Barry's, but I just like it.  If just came back from a vacation, or if you just need to get back into working out, Barry's is a great class to take.  BUT if you're looking to increase strength, I wouldn't do this class.

They do have a strength portion to every workout, but it's all about reps and you don't really get to isolate or do as many sets as you would like.  For instance, for Butts and Legs day, I did two sets of strength training for butts, but it was a different exercise.  We would spend maybe 1 minute on each exercise and that was it.  Not great for strength.<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Barry's is the absolute best workout you can get in 1 hour. The mix of cardio and floor / weights whips you into shape in no time. Yes, it's expensive ($30 per class) but the tradeoff is an amazing workout you would never have otherwise done yourself and much faster results. The instructors each have their unique personality and workout styles, so try them and see which suits you best! Great, clean facilities too with smoothies too!<//text>< pictures>

<text>I was really nervous to take a class because I generally shy away from bootcamps.  My idea of exercise includes enjoying yourself and I don't like the idea of being screamed at like I'm in the army.  Thankfully that was not my experience AT ALL!  The energy in the class is really upbeat and the instructor is really motivating.  The lighting is awesome and the music helps to keep you going.  I love cardio, but with the winter weather and lack of daylight, it makes it hard to get outdoors to run/bike, etc.  So Barry's is a great place for a superb workout.  I was so happy that I bought a 10 pack.< /text>< Pictures>

Pros: Excellent workout, motivating instructors. Also the smoothies looked great (next time I go, I'll get one).

Cons: It's filled to the brim with Marina types. There will be copious bros and blonde... bro-ettes(?). There will be grunting by the bros. There will be whoos and yeahs! by the girls. But the music and your heart will be thumping so it's easy to ignore.

Also just to clarify for those that are anxious about this class - I'm not a fantastic runner (I get winded at 6 mph at 10 minutes on the treadmill at 1% incline) and felt an unreasonable level of anxiety about this class due to the previous reviews. I had this incorrect misconception that you would be sprinting at 9 mph at various inclines for the entire 10 minutes on the treadmill. Instead, the treadmill portion is VERY interval based. You will be recovering a lot (walking or jogging - typically at an incline) and then sprinting for typically tens of seconds. It's challenging but it won't kill you or make you hurl. For reference: I started working out approximately a month ago so I'm fit but not in athlete shape.

So don't worry and give it a try!< /text>

Workout was great as usual but the SoMa location currently doesn't have hot water (as of Feb 3, 2019) which makes showering kind of painful.</Text>

<review>Just took my first Barry's class this past weekend and I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say it was the toughest workout of my life. I have never sweated or pushed myself that hard before and everyone left the class completely drenhed. The crazy thing was that I wasn't actually that sore the next day (I think it was due to all the cardio??) but it really was a full body workout.

The setup of the class is about 40 people split into two groups: treadmills and weights and you switch groups a couple of times to make sure you are really going as hard as you can at each segment. The room is dark and the music is loud but it really allowed me to lose myself for the hour I was there. It was such an exhilarating experience!  I definitely took a nap after that but was OK to workout the next day. Highly recommend Barrys - I'll be back!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>For a few decades this has been one of our favorites.   The chef is outstanding.  Surprisingly for our little town to have such talent.

Add to that just take the Main st exit off hwy 99 and drive in about 5 mins.   You’ll see a wonderful place with real old town feel.  Great food and people.  Just a fun day of shopping or just sitting outside on a spring night.  And check out the food pictures.  It tastes as good as it looks.

Well worth coming down town.

There are plenty of tables waiting here for you nice distancing and super clean!!!</review>< Pics>

Our family is from san Francisco and my brother in law is from Turlock. I love giving him a hard time about the fact there aren’t enough great places in Turlock. Well, Bistro 234 has something to say about that.

We ordered a few appetizers and the bacon wrapped scallops were eaten before I could take a picture. There was a nice crunch on the bacon and the scallops were nice and soft inside. Very flavorful and very juicy.

I like measuring a higher end restaurant by how they make their burger and this did not disappoint. The meat was amazing and the fries were spot on, super crispy and well seasoned. Think crunchy gourmet In and Out fries.

The belle of the ball was the lamb shank. The lamb was extremely juicy, full of flavor and was shared amongst the table because it was amazing. It was a special of the day and not on the regular menu.

The table also ordered the gnocchi, NY strip and the Mahi Mahi which were all Good but not memorable.

The service here was great. The waitress was attentive and helpful and the manager graciously  resolved a small issue for us on the wine.

I would recommend this place for a nice dinner in downtown Turlock. The food and service were great.< /Text>

I always enjoy eating at the Bistro and I order the chicken salad sandwich which is consistently good. My friend and I both ordered it but the croissants were toasted way too much and the salad was too juicy. This wasn't normal. Our salad and fries were very good. The service was great as always. The young ladies who work there are so sweet.<//Review>

Meh. That is my initial reaction to our 1st time here. For appetizers we had the crab cakes and separately 3 very small bacon wrapped scallops. Why 3 for 2 people I don't know. The food tasted pretty much OK. Not awesome. Just "Ok". The presentation was mediocre and the portions were microscopic. My wife had the Tiger prawns and scallops. I had the Seafood stew over risotto. I have no idea why they served her a few medium size shrimp instead of Tiger prawns and the scallops were tiny and very few. My stew was similar. Our meals were well over $100 so we expected better and more. Very disappointing. Our waitress seemed as if she wanted to be elswhere. To top it off flies descended on us the moment our food arrived. Perhaps our experience was an outlier. I don't think we'll be back.</Text>

I saw that Friday is happy hour until 6pm. Took the wife for a couple of drinks and when I got the tab the drinks were full price. I said I thought it was happy hour to which the bartender had to ask the manager. She said yes and gave me a new tab. The problem was each drink was only $2 off. I said the website said should be 1 half off. She asked the manager who said the website was hacked and that was not right. So I talked to the manager and he basically said too bad. This is not good customer service so be aware. He should have tried to make it right at least a little.< /text>

Never disposing. This place is so good. Only reason I wont give it 5 starts is because of The Grotto in Monterey Ca. But Turlock area is top game.</Text>

I came here on valentine's day with high hopes for a good meal, boy was I wrong! I do not know if it was because they were under staffed or had a new cook. We ordered steak cuts at 745 and waited almost an hour an a half. The steaks were cold and they ran out of mash potatoes and did not tell us. I would not eat here on valentine's day. Normally I like this place but tonight they dropped the ball.< /Review>

The drinks are a great start to the evening. Then you move to the food... Amazing!!!
I have eaten hear for years, not only is this food fantastic, but, more importantly, the quality, the taste, the preparation, is absolutely consistent!!! This to me, is the most important quality of this place!! I know, if I go there, take clients there, meet friends there.... it will be exactly like the last time. The staff are fantastic. All these qualities included, gives this place a wonderful vibe!!< /review>

<Review>The food is always excellent.  The wife and I like to go once in a while to enjoy a fancy meal.  They're seating is quite limited so reservation if possible.. The last time we didnt have a reservation but were welcomed to sit outside which was ok but it was a bit chilly and some wind coming into the outside area. We ended up toughing through it, however they had heat lamps but they "didn't work". For a place that is quite expensive I would like to think if their heat lamps did t work they would get them fixed or something.. that was my issue that day. If that's going to be the case maybe if I decide to go spontaneously it will be only during a summer night instead.. lol.</Review>< resp>

I asked for a New York steak and it was cooked perfectly medium rare but it was tough and chewy. My steak knife and my hand had a tough time cutting the steak. The steak was not seasoned, no flavored at all. I wonder how they stay in business. If can rate this restaurant a negative star I would do it.< /text>< Rating>

<Review>I have had the worst experience ever here. The customer service is horrible. And the food wasn’t great. For the price and area I expected much more. I had to ask for a side of sauce not once but three times, which I still didn’t receive. I finished my meal early because i couldn’t enjoy it. I will not be returning.<//Review>< Rating>

<text>Very disappointed. They were out of sourdough for the sandwich. I was served the wrong side & waited ten minutes for the replacement. My sandwich had two meager slices of turkey on it, one glob of cranberry & a lot of cream cheese. I showed it to the waiter & he said it was portion controlled. I had the same item here a couple months ago & the turkey was adequate. When my leftovers were boxed up my side was given to my friend & when I asked was told he thought she wanted it. What's going on? I've never had such a poor experience at Bistro 234 in the past.< /text>< user_id>

The food quality seemed quite good, however the price was very steep for mediocre at best service, as well as what seemed like small portions to me.</Review>

I was so looking forward to going here, but was underwhelmed. We took staff here for a company Christmas dinner, because we wanted to offer them something nice. Our table was right by the entrance next to the bar so there was lots of traffic. Service was very slow because our waiter was serving another large table. Food presentation of appetizers was good and they were tasty. Food presentation for main courses was really non existent. Dinner bowl with meat, potato and veggie. Like I do at home for the family. They had a special of rack of lamb that was prepared really well, but served in a dinner bowl. Try cutting a lamb chop in a bowl in a confined space ... you might end up wearing it. I suggest a flat dinner plate for this type of dish. Dessert presentation was average. All in all we were underwhelmed and will not rush back.</review>

Fantastic food in a great setting with excellent, friendly service. Ahi tuna was a favorite. Leave room for dessert.  The favorite, Diana Torte.  Well done Bistro 234.  Next visit to the area will definitely come again.< /Review>

Service was scarce. Chicken was overcooked, dry, and chalky medallion sized things and the marsala sauce was wayyy too sweet so i could not even taste marsala. My husband's meal was just as disappointing.  This place came highly recommended so maybe an off night...<//Text>

<Text>Great atmosphere, amazing food, friendly staff. If you haven't already been to Bistro 234, make your next night out here. They also serve lunch at certain times and days. Highly recommend for Anniversary, Birthday...
Also, I do recommend making reservations, although anytime we have gone in just to see if there's seating, the Manager always finds us a cozy corner or outside where the Turlock Main Street comes alive at night.
The Chicken Marsala is my very favorite♡< /Text><Time>1525244148071</Time><Name>Christine McKeon< /Name><response>None</response><rating>5< /rating></record>

My husband and I got engaged here 10 years ago tonight.  We have our favorite dishes that we always get and we always try something new. There is always a great variety of flavors and even a few gluten-free choices for me. Brida was our server and she was awesome. Lots of wonderful memories shared here!  Thank you!<//Review>

Nice settings and the staff are very helpful. The food is quite good but the menu doesn't change often which could be good if you want to come back for your favorites. The wine selection is good with half price on bottles Wednesdays.<//Review>

<text>This is quaint, trendy, fun place to have a meal, a drink at the bar, or get your day started with a specialty coffee.
The owners are fantastic, the chef is awesome and the wait staff is customer oriented.  They have outside seating as well as indoor.  Their menu is not extensive but offers a delicious selection of pasta, salads, freash fish, steak and soups.  Pair your meal with a nice wine or with a full bar order your favorite drink.  Always clean and well kept, you won't be disappointed you stopped in.  If eating alone, you can eat at the bar or one of the many tables.  Not equipped for real large gathering but with a reservation (which I recommend anyway) they will do their best to accommodate you.  Great atmosphere, wonderful food, Bistro 234 has it all.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

This is "fine dining" for Turlock. Most of the wait staff was friendly. Where we sat we could hear the wait staff complaining about their jobs and had one waitress was way less then pleasant. Wanted to try it but won't try it again.</Review>

Super loud music “we will rock you” and “macho man” at a romantic dinner just didn’t work.
Weak syrupy drinks compounded the problem.

We've discovered that sitting at the counter the service is excellent, but not at the tables. Food good, but not any healthy vegan options except the portabella mushroom sandwich. Friendly service.

<review>This has been a go to place for years for a good meal or celebration but tonight was nit good.  We were celebrating a birthday. Our food was cold and we never saw our server again until it was time for the bill.  We are not big drinkers and I think because we didnt order wine or appetizers, she wrote us off.  Dont need to return.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Incredible food. The flavors are just bursting! Higher end, dress nice but not formal. The “place to go” for the upper crust in Turlock. Outside dining with heaters available. Nice ambiance, dark and romantic inside, good date place. Side note: There are no substitutions/additions to a entree allowed, even for a fee. That was disappointing as I was hoping for a *taste* of the gnocchi alongside the Filet Mignon. They are both very good.</Review>

Ok food, but quite expensive. Ordered 2 of the least expensive items on the menu and 2 iced teas, and the bill was $41 including tax but not the tip. We nearly always tip 20% so that was another $8. Won't be back.<//review>

I have been here a few times already and I really like this place. The filet mignon, is delicious and tender, the half chicken is beyond delicious, and the drinks are made extremely well. The only thing that I can say that I did not like, was the Chilean Sea Bass. I hear it is a very difficult fish to cook; so perhaps they happen to have a bad day, but everything else: Delicious.</review>

<text>Had a reservation for two that was made a week before for 6:45. Got to the restaurant a little early at 6:30. Had to wait until 7:08 to be sat at our table. We saw at least two couples that arrived after us sat before we were. In the end we were sat next to the kitchen. The bread was cold and so was the butter that couldn't be spread on it. We ordered immediately after being sat since we had almost 40 minutes of time to think over our choices. It took 20 minutes to get our bruschetta. Our meals came out 10 minutes later. I wouldn't say it was worth the wait but it was quite good. Our servers were atentative but not terribly friendly. I might come back if I know the restaurant would honor my reservation.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Been coming here for a few years as one of me and my wifes nicer date night locations and have never been let down.  I recommend the prime angus filet entree very highly.  We both have trouble trying new things here as the presentation and experience of this dish leave us craving it when we decide to come to the bistro.< /Review>

Waiter was nice, but in no rush to get back to our table. Saw our food under the food lamp for a good 5 mins or so and was a little annoyed considering you pay about $30. a plate. My ribeye was over cooked and very tough and very salty. Only got 3 pieces of asparagus on my plate; mash potatoes were good. I will probably not be coming back here again.</Text>

The food was just ok.  I ordered the chicken masala and it lacked serious flavor.  Chicken tasted as though they were pre-cooked nuggets and tossed in a little bit of sauce.  Way too pricey for what you get.  Not worth it.<//Review>

We had grilled salmon and prongs and scallops penne for dinner. Then we finished with dessert tiramisu and carrot cake.  I thought everything was delicious.  This place was special they allowed me to pre order drinks and dinner, wanted to surprise my husband.  This is definitely a place I would revisit.  (special occasions) $$$ but worth it!!!

Easily the best restaurant off the Ave. They have the freshest fish! We had the mahi tacos, swordfish and the scallops; amazing! We finished dinner off with a creme brûlée and the best lava cake we've ever had! We were told they have a fantastic brunch on Saturday and Sunday we will definitely be coming back!  Check this place out, 5 stars!</Text>

The clams are awesome, sweet, spicy, garlicy, buttery; if you go you should try them. However, my wife's Chicken Marsala dish; the filets flaked apart like a fish!!! Never seen it before in that dish. It means the chicken was braised for an awful long time not sauteed; furthermore, the mushrooms may have been dehydrated from their appearance, thin tough, texture of leather. This was a poorly executed dish. 234 gained noteriety from that dish yet it was less to be desired today and for 23 bucks an utter disappointment. Chilean Sea Bass was very good, cooked perfectly, tarragon aoli was tartar sauce with little to no tarragon to taste. Lastly, the Jasmine rice; it might as be mom's rice pudding from left over rice, great dessert but not for dinner entree accompaniment. Wait service could not or would not reflect upon the chicken impression demonstration I provided her. Disappointed customer.</review>

<text>Just finished my birthday dinner there. And absolutely wonderful experience! We decided to make a meal of two appetizers, salad, some bubbly and dessert. The crabcakes are the best we have had anywhere, the roasted beet salad is delicious,  they bruschetta was very uniquely serve, deconstructed and easy to eat and incredibly delicious. The Keylime pie is second to none and it was the perfect finish with a cup of black coffee. The wine with dinner was the sparkling wine named "toast" and was delicious. Our server was superb .< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>I've eaten here several times and I've yet to be disappointed. My two favorite meals are the Prime Angus Filet and the Potato Gnocchi. For appetizers I like both the Seasoned Roasted Asparagus and the Roasted Beet Salade. Their martinis are also phenomenal. Highly recommend Bistro for some of the best food from Merced to Modesto.</review>< Name>

<userid>109228802491978034307</userid><Review>Reserved a party of 15 and spoke to the manager and he was super nice. Came and it was all set up beautifully only downside was that it was very little space. Not so much of a good idea being by the bathroom but we managed. The waiters were super nice to wait on our party when some was arriving pretty late. They were very patient and kind. The food was delicious. I mean we were those people who only eats at BJs as a fancy place. It was unique and good in its own way. Only downside is its very pricey. I mean priiiiceeeyyyy. But its worth it. Just the delicious texture and taste of the food gets you full quick. Lots of varieties of wine and maybe three to five different cocktails. Overall its a small place for a party but awesome food and staff. And if your a wine lover this is the place to be. Gotta come back here for their ahi tuna😍😍😍. Omg its to die for. Lol< /Review>< rate>

< review>
TLDR: Subpar service and nothing special about the food. Pick a different place for lunch if you are already in downtown Turlock.
Context:
Went to celebrate my sister graduating college. We had a party of five.we arrived for lunch and had a reservation for noonish. The restaurant was not busy, though they may have had a party in the backroom.
Service: 1/5
Slow and largely absent for the majority of the meal. We were seated at 12-ish and we're not able to place our food order until at least 12:30. The sandwiches we ordered took 45-60 minutes to arrive. Normally if the quality is great, that doesn't bug me, but what we received was rather subpar for the price. When we asked for something on the side with the meal (after it was delivered), we never got it. Our waiter did not come to check on us, and stopped by at 1:30/2 to see if we wanted dessert. We asked what the options were and told him we needed a moment to decide. We never saw him again until he dropped off the bill (after we paid) luckily the hostess came by 20 minutes later and was able to take our dessert order, bring the desserts, and find a different waiter to bring out our bill.
Food: 2/5
All the food options were plain. Like, white people that can't handle seasoning plain. The burger we ordered (there was only 1 on the menu) came with nothing but cheese on it. When we asked, a waiter (not ours) told us the other burger had lots of stuff, but the one we must have ordered comes plain. Again, there was only one burger option on the menu. One of our other people ordered his sandwich with a salad and got fries, the fries I received were room temperature at best and way saltier than everyone else's.
Atmosphere: 4/5
Pretty restaurant, great location. There really is a lot of potential here to be a great place.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Great pizza!  Just moved to area and found them on Google.  Pesto sauce was flavorful and toppings fresh but the kicker was the crust.  Cooked to perfection with nice chew to the crust all the way to the center.  Super tasty and the staff was very friendly and portions were generous!  We found our new local Pizza Joint in Rincon Valley.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808447f71cf0ced5:0x897e24ed6383f13b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The best around. More to pizza than crust and cheese. This place knows how to combine flavors like few others. Jack & Delores on point. Don't miss it.<//Review>

<text>I don't normally like sourdough, but this place easily has the best sourdough crust I've ever had, it makes the pizza. A little high on price to topping ratio, but the taste is solid. Overall a really really good meal. Meatballs are right in the strike zone for cost/flavor/size.</text><user_id>101822057611922513735< /user_id>< Time>

Great crust and toppings and the pizza was enormous.  The only thing as good as the pizza was the fabulous customer service; honestly the best service I have had in a very long time.

<text>great pizza, crust is excellent and is everything it should be on a pizza, is also prepared quickly and brought right out to my car! ty urban pizza

I would have given a 5th star if I could see some daily deals...your pricing is high but justified in quality and service, deal of the week or day will put you guys over the top imo< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<review>Visiting from out of state we were looking for some good pizza. This seemed like a sensible option based on other reviews. We were not disappointed. The salad was among some of the best we have had fr a pizza place. The pies were well balanced with great consistency and flavor. Very pleased with our visit and would recommend people check this spot out if they are in the area.<//review><pics>None< /pics><time>1592342196751</time><Rate>5< /Rate>< gmap_id>

Dough and crust are not too dense with a good chew and initial crunch/crispiness. Good sauce to cheese and topping ratio and not greasy. One of the better pizzas I've had in a while.</review>

The pizza was ok but the dough was very chewy. I expected better for the price. The Cesear salad had no dressing and the breadsticks were supposed to have mozzarella on it. It was a bummer of a first experience. We haven't been able to find a place that is consistent with quality. The only good things was it was delivered in 30 mins instead of 45 min and the person on the phone was helpful when ordering.<//review>

<Text>Amazing place. DO NOT Miss out on this Gem. Driving through town looked up pizza and found urban pizza. After looking at the menu I knew this had to be the place. Decided upon the Jack and Delores pizza which was perfect also got a side of breadsticks which was as good as the pizza. Can’t emphasize enough how great the food was and they had top notch service that will never be forgotten. I would litterly make the 100 mile drive back just to eat here again!!!</Text>< Pictures>

This place is the REAL DEAL. The owner/chef has been making pizza for a very long time, and he obviously loves it. Don't tell this secret, but the crust is outlandishly delicious. Some of the pies have interesting and unusual combinations of flavor. We almost never get all the way back home before breaking into the box for a hot slice.< /Text>

They have the perfect ratio of dough, sauce and toppings resulting in the perfect bite every time. When I go to pizza shops I usually shy away from "meat lover" types of pizza because they can be overly greasy. We decided to give their "Urban Beast" a shot and let me tell you...they knocked it out of the park. It was not overly greasy and by the end of the slice I was already ready for the next.

< Review>
I am here from Los Angeles on a visit and wanted to try some local pizza. I looked around and found this spot. They only have outside seating which works for me because we take our dog everywhere. The owner was super friendly and made great conversation. All in all the atmosphere, the food and the people really sold this place.

Now the food... The food was great. I had a simple pepperoni pizza. I feel a pepperoni pizza is a good place to start when trying a pizza place. They use a nice fatty pepperoni that has a good amount of grease to it but doesn't leave your mouth feeling oily. They use a good mozzarella and their sauce is slightly thick and on the sweeter side. The crust is on the thinner side but with a good bready chew. All in all, it was a great pizza.

My only regret was that I discovered they had baked sandwiches, not too different from a calzone, after eating 3/4th of my pizza. I forget the name of the sandwiches but I'm sure there's an image of the menu.

This place gets my 5 stars. I highly recommend coming here. This place is a prime example of why people shop local/small business.< /Review>

{'time': 1581553059629, 'text': 'Hello Dave.  Small family businesses struggle to survive at this heavily corporatized time.  Social media is one area that we can catch a break in our place overhead costs.  Great ratings are a part of that.  I wish that you would have come to us and let us make your poor experience with our product up to you rather then weaponizing google, yelp, FB, etc.\n\nWe happened to have a regular customer get what I am guessing was the same batch of sauce that had slipped through our QC process.   He came back in and we were able to make it good.  Wish you would have as well rather then giving us a terrible review.  One of the beauties of being working owners is that we can respond immediately.  Running a business means being constantly on your game.  Unfortunately mistakes will occasionally happen.  Please consider going directly to the source if you are not happy rather then trashing the product or service.  Especially if you are a one time customer.'}</Response>

Bought 10 neon tetras and a couple of Anubis plants. The purchased products had ick and infected my tank. I am down to one fish. There was nothing different with my tank but the new addition from this shop.

Customer service was great and the gentleman helping me was kind and informative. Made suggestions on products that came in useful. In addition he wasn’t disturbed by the mention of other online purchases and prices.

The prices were very reasonable and sometimes cheaper and more plentiful than online.

Great place and would return to give it another try.</review>

<text>I was just trying out a new fish store and I am very happy I did. They have a great selection of betta fish and other fresh water fish. I bought 2 female betta fish, 1 male, and 2 balloon mollies. who are the cutest. The plant selection was also very good. And they have the coolest Nano tank setup in the front of the shop.< /text>< time>

<review>Tldr: quality bettas, good selection of aquarium plants, boy who helped me was good

I went today because the reviews said they had a good betta selection. Although the selection was not huge like other stores all the fish were healthy and very unique. There were only about 25 fish at most (all different colors and types) and it was very hard to pick a favorite.

The prices of the bettas range from $20 to $35, very reasonable for the pretty fish. There were no prices on some of the items but the boy running the store was able to tell me no trouble. The store was not overly packed with products and fish which was fine it meant the store was very clean and open. Still a good selection of products.

They also had a good selection of aquarium plants and shrimp.< /review>< pics>

If anyone visited this small store it would be obvious that all the five star reviews are from friends and family of the owner and fake bots reviews. This place is extremely limited in selection and I have no idea how they stay in business. Buncha empty tanks.<//review>

The owner Dragon is very friendly and helpful. He is willing to make a deal on certain items like driftwood, fish, etc. They have the typical fish store stuff plus some unique items, fish, deco. The epitome of a small business, highly recommend< /Review>

<review>Little shop that appears only to be ran by one person. I like coming here for the driftwood and has a huge selection of decor that I don't see at any other fish store. Fish looked healthy but didn't have any I've been interested in. They do have a great setup that I wish more stores had set up for Betta fish with a wall of small connected tanks with individual sections for each Betta with a constant flow of water instead of just small "deli containers" with no flow. However I did find some in those in the store.< /review>< Date>

< review>
The owner is very rude. I went there today with my fiancé to look for a betta fish and when I came I saw very little selection of betta compare to the last time I came they have a very big selection of bettas. I'm simply ask him "hey you guys only have a few bettas left, did you guys sold out?" The owner could've simply said "oh we're sold out, we'll get more next time" or something similar to that  but instead he said "You think the fish wait for you? I sell to who ever buy. I only sell to you 1 or 2 betta at a time at that rate my store will close." I was shocked and me and my fiancé walked around look a bit then he came and said "if you want a bigger selection go to Petco or Petsmart they have more betta." First of all I want to help out private fish store that's why I came back looking for another betta. But if he doesn't want my business I'll gladly to somewhere else. Second there is another store down the road call Big Save Discount and they sell super cheap betta and decent quality as well. They get new betta in every Tuesday. I would not go back to this store again because the owner was very rude bad attitude. I only ask him one question and he snap at me and tell me to go somewhere else. If I was rude I would've said back "If you don't want my business then I'll go somewhere else. And you sold out of your fish you don't want to get new fish then might as well close down your store why bother open a fish store for?" But I didn't want to be rude to him even when there were no customers there and we left.<//review>

This store is great. The owner dragon is very nice. The fish are great quality and great prices. The betta are the best anywhere. Great service healthy aquarium plants. My husband and I also buy aquariums at Cali's better than petco or petsmart dragon treats us very well<//Review>

By far the best betta  fish prices and fish selection in the orange county area , give this place your buisness so it can become even better  , The owner is really cool and you can bargain with him , Since finding this Gem i have no interest in other fish stores .< /Review>

You can tell Dragon cares about the quality of the fish he decides to put in the store. His selection is not many, but they are definitely of quality, I purchased a few rasboras here and they are thriving. Edit 8/14/2016: (just got guppies here, they're pretty awesome sometimes have the absolute best "Mosaic" breed in the OC stores I've been to.<//Review>

They have awesome Ranchu I was amazed with their variety.... Being going around other local fish store and wasn't able to find the perfect Ranchu.... Dragon is the owner there and he is very helpful and his Ranchu are really beautiful quality. Will definitely come back if he stocks more.<//Review>

My favorite fish store in town. Why?  Recently got back into the hobby with a 30 gallon clear for life, I needed to stock it. Luckily the "Dragon" helped select the right ones for me. I really wanted a pair of Oscars and a convict, but after conversation of what i am looking for , got  5 other smaller cichlids that suited my needs. I am glad he was so helpful. Prices are great, always willing to make a deal. I like this store because the owner is so friendly and customer oriented. may be a week or a year since you go, but he will still remember you. Great people, it's worth checking out for all you fresh water, cichlid african/south american, etc.. or just need a replacement pump or a quick batch of meds, etc..  lots of other medium sized fish to stock your large aquarium or storefront. Call ahead for salt/ live rock  and other options avail.Customer service A+.  Worth stopping by.</review>

I was there as part of the cast for a student made film. It is a great school if you can judge by the level of professional resources available to the students . I'm not in the photos. They're fellow actors.</Text>

My son is graduating this year after four years of an absolutely outstanding experience. Their high level of education; care, attention, support and understanding is nothing less than excellent. Add to that the conservatories that provide a cultural education and appreciation for the arts and you have a formula that is unmatched and invaluable. Yes, it is not easy to get in, students need both an academic and arts proficiency, but it is well worth a try. Students graduate and move on to top-rated colleges and universities, with the added value of an otherwise costly and rare opportunity to grow in their chosen art field.< /text>

I am a 2004 Graduate of this school and I had the best time of my life!  The staff and the teachers were wonderful and they were more willing to help myself and other students with anything we did not understand.  They were patient and kind.  Those who think that this school does not know what they are doing, you are absolutely wrong.  The level of professionalism I experienced was high.  Not only that, but the program I was in was small but it was fun.   Thank you OCSA for helping me find out who I am and letting me be myself.  :)<//review>

The best school in existence. No public school could even come close. There is not a single mean person, I am amazed, it is practically utopian! I am excited to be here- the days are longer than most high schools, and I wouldn't have it any other way. FIVE STARS.<//Text>

OCSA is not your normal high school experience. It's unique in the fact that it is a very welcoming community for LGBT+ and all sorts of artistic people. I've met amazing people here, but I will be transferring out due to the 9 1/2 hour day schedule and other personal reasons. Unfortunately, there is only a few categories in which certain people are not as accepted as others. A straight, white, religious student at OCSA faces a surprising amount of playful jokes, but we all know how often "playful jokes" are considered funny. A great school for a lot of kids, but just not right for other kinds. :)<//review>

It's my first year at OCSA and I fit in right away, everyone was so sweet and very professional!  I would 100% recommend this school to anyone who wants to pursue a career in the arts!</review>

Children are comfortable and happy expressing themselves here through the arts.  Beats violence and gang life.  Beautiful.  Well done Santa Ana.</text>

Orange County School of Arts or OCSA as it is called is the place for your artistically talented child, and is the number 1 charter school in the state of California.<//Text>

< Review>
It is said that Disneyland is the happiest place on earth - I disagree - I believe OCSA deserves that moniker. Middle school and high school can be horrible, but the staff and students at OCSA make the school a wonderful, fun, joyous experience. Except for a couple of teachers who were duds (and most of them didn't last more than a year), the teachers are fantastic - they WANT to be at OCSA because the students are motivated and engaged.

And then there's just the wild creativity - best day of the year is Halloween - hands down! The costumes the kids come up with are simply amazing (my all-time fave? the boy who wore a sheet with empty candy boxes, popcorn and empty soda cups stuck to it and a popcorn container on his head like a crown - he was the floor of the movie theater after the show!!!).

The principal and vice-principal, as well as the campus security, deserve special mention for making the school safe, keeping the kids just disciplined enough to keep them out of trouble but not so tight that their creativity is squelched, and for listening sensitively and acting immediately when there's any sort of problem. All in all, OCSA is the best school I've ever been exposed to - I am so incredibly grateful that my daughter spent 6 years there.< /Review>

<text>Just tried it today. This is the same quality food you would expect from an upscale place charging double or more. Served casual and at fantastic prices. Had the salmon/swai combo with olive oil with zucchini and brown rice on the side. Delicious. Will definitely be back soon.< /text>< response>

<Text>Good, fresh-tasting and well-prepared fish and sides. Both the grilled and fried fish were great. The catfish, corn side and slaw were particularly good. Their self service soda station has mostly gourmet sodas. There's a fairly large condiment bar with homemade ketchup, salsa and tarter sauce and a lot more. The prices are low for the quality of food. The cashier service was helpful and polite. The food took awhile to be prepared, but the place was pretty busy while I was there. It has a clean, pleasant, modern interior with outdoor seating in front. They also sell beer and wine. Most meals come with a choice of 2 side dishes. Note that there are house sides and premium sides, which can be selected for a added charge. The roasted street corn is premium, though worth the extra charge.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I've eaten at California Fish Grill three times and enjoyed it twice. Do not order the Poke Bowl unless you like EXTREMELY spicy food! They also don't have chopsticks. I forced myself to finish the fish in the poke bowl because I didn't want to waste it, but couldn't finish the rest of the boel<//Review><gmap_id>0x808e332a80ee5f27:0xdcaa1e84bbd4726f</gmap_id>< resp>

<userid>102265436909171524825</userid><review>Fast casual seafood focused restaurant located in a strip mall. Parking is usually not a problem. Food tastes good, the portions are large and the prices are very reasonable. Services was friendly and efficient. They claimed most grilled items could be made gluten free and that they have a separate fryer for battered products.<//review>< Response>

Ever since Race St Fish Market closed it's been hard to find a good place. This one is really good. Not over battered and crispy fish and the fires were seasoned just right not overseasoned. The kale slaw was good too. Over all great.</text>

Covid review: this place is delicious I am so glad I found it! The indoor seating is all closed but there is like four tables outside in their patio With umbrellas. I got the spicy bowl shrimp and substituted the rice with cauliflower rice. It was very tasty and I would get again. The other I got is fish and chips and was a little bit more fried than I thought but the fish was nice and moist and soft which was excellent. The fries are just normal fries. The corn side was nicely seasoned and the coleslaw was not too saucy which was good and really fresh with a fresh bite. Definitely would come again and try other dishes.</Text>

<Review>They had a good selection. We tried their fish and chips which was good and did not feel too greasy. I specially liked the Seared Ahi Tuna with cauliflower rice and Kaleslaw. I definitely would suggest this restaurant, plus they have outdoor seating.</Review>< pictures>

What a fantastic find! Tons of flavorful, healthy options at very reasonable pricing. Shrimp & fish offerings to please any palate - we tried three choices, Cajun shrimp tacos,  the dynamite shrimp bowl & classic fish & chips. All were home runs - fresh, hot & tasty with generous portion sizes! We will definitely be back when we're in the area.< /Review>

First time there...fresh, affordable & healthy. I'm one who goes for flavor, not necessarily healthy. I dont even like cauliflower. But, the cauliflower rice was so good, I will choose that for BOTH of my two sides next time!< /review>

Great food. Good options. Super fast service. I really like how they double or triple check each order to make sure it is correct. Excellent place to get food.</text>

Food is good. The salmon was super tasty. The only issue we had was the line and how long it takes to get your food. After we ordered it took 35 min to get our food.</text>

I ordered from California Fish Grill through door dash yesterday. My order was on its way in 10 min and i received in 25 min. I was sure that I was going to be disappointed with the quality, but food was surprisingly amazing, not good just amazing. I think one of the best fish and chips I’ve ever eaten. Very clean and great packaging. Thank you! 🙏🏼< /Review>

<Text>The CA Fish Grill just officially opened today with regular hours of operation (so I don’t know why that Michael McCleskey guy gave them a 1-star review for being closed 3 days ago. LOL). I, however, was lucky enough to attend their soft opening preview event, and let me tell you, I am addicted!! My whole family went, and we each ordered something different to try. My favorite was the battered fish and chips. Three large crispy pieces with moist and flaky swai inside, it’s one of the best I’ve ever had! The ahi poke bowl had a great portion of fresh tuna, with a little kick of spice, and was really delicious! We also had the coconut curry shrimp, the ahi tuna steak, the barramundi sea bass, the giant shrimp plate, battered shrimp tacos, and the Atlantic salmon. Everything was cooked to perfection! The best sides were the brussel sprouts and fire-roasted corn (totally worth the upgrade). And their fancy array of different juices and soda flavors were also fun to try! The portions here are generous and the prices are super affordable. This is the first time we’ve eaten here, but we’re definitely becoming regulars for sure. :)</Text>< pics>

I ordered the Dynamite Shrimp Bowl. It was amazing! My wife had the breaded calamari which she found to be just okay. The portions are large and the price is fair for what you receive. The ingredients options are definitely on the healthier side. Definitely will come by again to try their other offerings.

The location is situated in a strip mall with ample parking. The building/store itself is rather small and very limited seating. If they maintain their popularity, I would opt out dining in which leads into my next point.

Please note, due to this location being new, they had a line out the door. Fortunately, we ordered online and was able to skip the madness. We only had to wait 10 min for our order to complete given how extremely busy they were.<//Review>

This place is incredible! Great food, fair prices for the portions. We've gone here a couple times since they opened and it very quickly made its way into our regular rotation. My partner loves the clam chowder and fries and I love the grilled fish. So far, the shrimp skewers and Mahi have been my favorite (Cajun style). Sometimes can be a little crowded, but that's with good reason.</text>

Very rude! Due to health reasons by Americans with Disabilities Act I'm unable and therefore not required to wear a mask. Employees and management was extremely rude demanding i put a mask on. They did not care about ADA and discrimination laws they were violating and told me to get out and order by phone. Had not been there prior and my 2 children wanted to eat there. They didn't give us a menu or anything to be able to create an order. Will not be going back and i did file a complaint with the ADA< /review>

I used to live in Orange County and this place was always my go-to spot. When I saw that one opened in San Jose, I was so excited! I ordered a white fish with the garlic butter sauce which was great as always. The grilled zucchini was always my favorite and lived up to its standards. Lastly, I love that there is a salsa/condiment bar.<//Text>

We heard good things about California Fish Grill, so we decided to try it. They have mostly fish and some seafood and chicken dishes. We got the Dynamite Rockfish and Cajun Mahi Mahi. I loved the Dynamite Rockfish. It's fried and has their dynamite sauce on it. The Cajun Mahi Mahi was OK. It was our back up because they were out of Ahi Tuna. A salmon dish may have been a better choice for me personally. I did like their dynamite sauce on the Rockfish and fries. The sauce has a nice kick. I would definitely come back again and try new dishes!<//Text>

<Text>Food looks good and there is a good selection of seafood. The taste is decent. The issue is that it gets crowded and the customers grab tables before getting in line to order, leaving people who received their food with no table to eat at. We had to change our order to go, and the manager seemed slightly annoyed, even though it's because there were no tables for us. They should tell customers to only grab tables after ordering.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Several of my clients mentioned to me about this new seafood restaurant, Calif Fish Grill. They raved about it so I stopped by on the way home.

I ordered our dinner online, 15 mins later it was ready to be picked up.

My family absolutely loved their meals. It was delicious, large portions and moist.Also, the fish was grilled perfectly.

Next time we'll make time to dine @ the restaurant.</Review><Time>1585488198409</Time>< name>

There's a lot to like about this establishment.  The place is clean and well organized, the staff are friendly and in some cases enthusiastic, and I always like outdoor seating.

However, the downside is that the location is not great and the food is 'uninspired'.  Given that the ingredient quality seems to be high-medium, I expected it to taste great, but everything that I tried was bland or one-dimensional.  I think that the staff and cooks are doing a fine job, but the recipes need to be reworked.  Even the salsa is boring.  As someone who has eaten a lot of shrimp tacos, I always thought that it was impossible to make wrong.  I now know differently.< /review>

Wow!  What a great lunch! This location in San Jose just opened. The Branzino with Garlic Butter Sauce was excellent. However the Fish and Chips was probably the best ever! (Beer Batter was the thinnest, lightest, crispy, buttery goodness to ever come on a piece of Swai Fish!).

Crispy Cunchy Grilled Asparagus with Pan Fried Sea Scallops in Garlic Butter... How can you beat that! If they can keep up the quality this place will be packed!</text>

I ordered online and just picked up my order.  They said 3p and I picked up at 3:01p.  I did not get my Kaleslaw and the fries are cold.  My 3rd time eating at California Fish Grill and 1st time at this location and I'm disappointed.<//review>

We waited for 12mins in line to order the food,  to be told that the items we wanted were unavailable. We then waited 30mins for the food to be served ice cold. We sent the coldest meal back to the kitchen to be made again for no cost, and waited 15mins for it to be very hot.  The food did taste very good, and we were pleased with the meals, aside from the time and the temperature.
It seemed as though they gave online orders priority over the sit down orders.
They do not have grilled fish that can be in a taco, only battered fish can be in tacos.<//review>

Battered fried fish and fries portion large, could have used a light hand on the salt. Kale slaw could use a touch of light vinegar to brighten it up. Maybe I will try the fish tacos next visit.<//text>

What more can I say than an experience to enjoy! Amazing service paired with excellent and elegantly prepared dishes. Each dish more beautiful than the last with a mouthful of heaven to boot! Don't come in thinking this is your typical sushi joint! Oh no, my friend! Make your reservations and prepare for an experience! And don't forget to try the rice or potato based drink. You'll forget all about the sake you've treated in the past.
P.S. For those who get to sit at the bar, handy bag hooks underneath make all the little things so much more complete.</Text>

The chef at Tanaka takes pride in every dish he presents. Each dish is beautifully presented on white plates which gives focuses the presentation on the fish.  The fish is extraordinarily fresh and the chef highlights each piece with different salts, fresh yuzu, fresh wasabi, and light citrus sauces. I recommend the omakase... And for this kind of quality at this price you can't find anywhere. The service is very pleasant and attentive. Never intrusive but always aware of the tables and your needs. If you are looking for soy sauce and special rolls go else where. But if you are looking for artisticly presented, fresh fish in a quiet, low key setting I highly recommend Tanaka Sushi.<//text>

<text>Very good and very special. I think it's  not that traditional.  You have to try it If you like smoky or truffle, their sushi taste so to me.  It was recommended by our trust worthy foodie friends, had high expectations but not disappointed at all. Super nice people too. Relatively cheap compared to the quality.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Review>I've been eating sushi all over Southern California for over 30 years and have never had sushi this good. Outstanding fish, sauces, and technique. There was just the sushi chef, Sei Tanaka, and the waitress (his wife), and, at a 6:30 p.m. seating, three couples, including hubby and me.  All of us ordered the chef's choice for $100.00 each, which places our dining experience in Chef Tanaka's talented hands.  If I had known this would be so transcendent, I would have taken pictures and cataloged every dish served.  It was that good.  It's like eating choice steak your whole life and then trying Kobe.  You will never go back to regular sushi.  YOU MUST GO HERE.  That is all.< /Review><response>None< /response>< username>

I have spent much time in Japan and eaten sushi from a number of the highest rated shops around the country, as well as local spots. I live in Simi and find that every trip to Sushi Tanaka is a blissful reminder of my travels. The fish is incredibly fresh and the preparation is delicious - every bit as good as I seek out while in Japan. The service is both  respectful and personal - very welcoming. I return to eat here on a regular basis and I will continue to do so. What an incredible find in Simi!< /review>

<Review>When I visited this place, the first thought that came to my mind was, "This is the Good Life." The simple pleasures of eating quality food that transported a person from ordinary living to a place of exotic paradise. You become so thankful for the fish, the fisherman who caught it, and the artist who carefully crafted each piece so that you can have this experience. It was a beautiful epicurean night.

You'll find yourself asking... Am I really in a Simi valley strip mall? What is this fish? Where does one get it? Gingko fish, sea robin...

How do you get salmon to be this soft and flavorful yet carry the flavor of charred salmon skin? How can the Toro be as tender as the uni? What is this sea perch that is fresh like white fish yet melts in your mouth like fatty red fish?

You'll also meet fun and charming people sitting along with you at the sushi bar. They are probably regulars who love sushi and love the place. It's like sitting at the theater with fellow fans. Their enjoyment adds to yours.

Chef's menu changes frequently and each visit I'm surprised at the inventiveness, thoughtfulness and of course deliciousness that he brings to the table. Add to it a very well curated and well priced sake list and it's a place worthy of any special occasion. And one that I want to come to all the time.<//text>< pics>

<review>This is truly a Japanese sushi restaurant. I was a little disoriented because I’m used to the Americanized sushi restaurants. I can’t believe how authentic and amazing this place is and ESPECIALLY in Simi Valley! I’ve been to several sushi restaurants that were “ok” but this place simply blew them out of the water. They get their fish almost daily from a fish market that imports directly from Japan. The taste will tell you all you need to know. Beware: place is small so make reservations to ensure a seat.< /review>< pics>

The best hidden sushi gem of LA. It deserves to be on all the lists, but since it's in the middleof nowhere people don't know about it. It's also the best value omakase of any I've had.< /Review>

Truly spectacular culinary omakaze experience. Make reservations in advance as the place is really small. Fantastic sake selection.< /text>

I mean, wow. If you want some of the highest quality, traditional style sushi straight from Japan, this is the place to come. I travel all around looking for the freshest fish and authentic style of serving sushi and this check marks every box. The chef is from Japan and clearly has been trained in the art of fine sushi. His fish is top notch , the service is impeccable and the level of detail he put to each piece of nigiri is exceptional. Don't expect stupid saucy Americanized rolls and soy sauce platters to drench rolls into. He glazes each fish with its own sauce to compliment that specific fish. It's a small little place, very clean and organized. Let the chef do his thing and take his omakase course if your new to this type of sushi. Otherwise go down that nigiri list and enjoy yourself. This place is a hidden gem and I will definitely be going back soon.<//Review>

We're from the San Francisco Bay Area so we were looking for quality sushi bar and came across this place on our way to SoCal for the weekend. It's in a strip mall and hidden but a hidden gem indeed!  The cherry salmon from Japan and the blackthroat seaperch were absolutely delicious.  Honestly every piece of fish was soooo good.
Will definitely be back next time I'm driving through to SoCal.</Text>< pics>

We are an avid sushi lovers and we have​ been in several sushi restaurants everywhere but nothing comes close to Tanaka sushi,the quality of fish And the exotic verioty is like no other.
I highly recommend it,you will never be dispointed. Also not to forget the good value for the quality.</Text>< Pics>

<rate>5</rate><Review>I love this place. So, I left this same lengthy review on Yelp. This has to be the rarest gem in Simi Valley. If you are looking for authentic sushi and outstanding service, this is the place to be. The restaurant itself is situated next to a hair salon and doesn't look anything out of the ordinary from the outside. Don't be fooled! The inside was elegant, quiet, charming, and very clean. We sat at the bar and ordered the $100 Omakase meal per person. Totally worth every penny and all 15 dishes. The sushi chef had exemplary skills and attention to detail. Each dish we ordered was so delicious and presented so well. You can tell that he had knife skills with the precision he had with the cuts on the fish and how he prepared everything.

You must drink with sake when you come here,  it will make your dinner even more enjoyable. The vibe was very relaxing in the restaurant. Limited seating so it's best to make reservations in advance.

I came here for my birthday on October 14 and I was shocked when the lovely waitress came up next to me with a sweet "Happy Birthday!" and handed me a plate of what I believe were the best tasting ice cream mochi Ive had by far. And I have had a lot of Mochi Ice cream before . Most Japanese restaurants seem to just serve the store bought ones. This, however, was the real deal. The mochi dough was melt-in-your-mouth delicious! The vanilla ice cream inside was so smooth and creamy, almost as if they just made it. They even added a birthday candle on one. I wasn't expecting that since I dont think I've ever had a birthday mochi before. It was so simple and perfect.

All I have left to say is, DEFINITELY give this place a try because it's totally worth checking out.

I will be coming back for sure.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Beautifully cooked to perfection, juicy and delicious. Wish they would expand into Hollywood/Highland Center. I HIGHLY recommend trying them, flame broiler meats also available in a sandwich, try the salads, hummus and eggplant... yummy, freshly made daily. For around the same cost as McDonald's you get fresh, healthy and delicious.< /review>< Pictures>

I have never tried this place before but I was super hungry and this was the best option for my hunger so I looked at the menu and decided.  I ordered the number 12B with a san peregrino drink.  It took abouy 15 min. It looked good to the eye but when I tried it, the rice was watery. The salad was dry for my liking and the chicken koobideh was very bland and tasted of egg. I dont think ground chicken should taste like that . Anyhow after discarding more than half my dish I think ill stick to the real deal . Hopefully their restaurant improves their quality of meat. Good luck</Text>

<review>"Can I order a veggie gyro"?
Yes, (names vegetables)
3 min later- TEXT- your order is ready.
Go to pick up, " we're making it".   ?????
I pick up - it's loaded with meat.
"I ordered a veggie gyro".
Cashier- we don't have a veggie gyro.
"You originally said yes. I asked for gyro just leave the meat out". "I'll pay the same".
We can't. We don't have a veggie gyro.
I couldn't help but laugh. I opened it and removed the meat myself.< /review><name>Richard Ventura< /name></record>

Must try the mixed combo with chicken and beef was excellent along withe the balsamic rice was all great.  The place is designed to have the chefs grill right in front of your eyes.  Real kool to send the chef making his magic.  I would definitely recommend this spot and I definitely will be going there again. Thanks so much.< /text>< Time>

Tasty and amazing.

Although it is inside a food court, it is 100% worth the walk from the parking lot.

The rice is simple yet delicious.
The meat is delicious and filling.

I highly recommend eating here!<//Review>

This is one of the few spots open inside the Galleria and it usually has a long line but worth it since they are cooking your food fresh. They are following covid guidelines well including sealing your togo bags shut to ensure no one tampered with your food.

They have amazing family meal deals right now and I definitely recommend those. We did the Chicken Kabob and Beef Koubideh meal, filled up a family of 4. The rice was delicious, enough meat and the sides were great. I would recommend ordering additional sides if thats a fav for the family as they were a bit small.</Review>

<Review>I drove one hour or more just to buy my favorite Trout fish on the menu, I think the most expensive simple order in the menu. At Glendale Galleria every time we go to L.A.  But I was so frustrated yesterday that it was NOT the same taste...the rice which I like is not the same Buttered Basmati rice it has no aroma and no taste of basmati rice at all!!!  The fish, the TROUT, my favorite is not cooked the way it was, it doesn't taste grilled and it's not shiny (no butter) and not aromatic like it was originally. (Please remove some of the bones, it has too much).  It seems it was PREPARED IN A HURRY.  I've been an avid customer for years and years now...I hope you will cook or prepare the same way as it was before...please don't change your original recipe...please...please< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>It's horrible, garbage, OMG it was the worst kabob dish I've ever had. Trust me, I'm Persian and I know how kabob dishes are supposed to be and taste. Those who gave 5 stars to this place, have no idea how real kabob dishes taste.< /text><time>1592721469101<//time><name>Matt Matthews<//name><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0560ff9d893:0xa36bc1f57604f0b3</Gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

This restaurant is hands down the best middle eastern food in the Bay Area! My husband discovered it a couple of day ago and I had the pleasure of trying it today. It was beyond delicious. The rice, lamb and chicken were cooked perfectly, and spiced just right. We are definitely coming here as often as possible.</review>

Before the food was so good but now the food is not good and all the salads is very old and they put them away for the next day, the taste is rancid and price is expensive for a small portion of meat. I vomited out the food and will not go there again.< /text>

<Text>I got the lamb chops and after watching them cook the meat for about 15 min I had to tell them to get them off the fire because they were overcooking them ..and they were very overcooked indeed (20$ wasted) on the other side the roasted tomato wasn't cooked enough and the pita bread was not edible. 2 Stars for the rice which was ok.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80c2c0560ff9d893:0xa36bc1f57604f0b3<//GmapID></record>

We've gotten all variety of kebab here and none have disappointed. My toddler loves everything here. We eat here quite often and the only complaint is that it's in the mall so sometimes it's hard to find seating but that's not really their fault. We also call inand take our order to go and they are very helpful and very quick about it.<//Text>< pictures>

Beef kabob meal was not worth the 12 bucks. More like a plate full of rice and grinded beef with somewhat kind of flavor that I'd rate at 3/10.  Friend of mine got the chicken plate.  Chicken he said was good but short. Again bowl full of rice, 3-4 small pieces of chicken and a tomato for about 12-13$   Not worth it.< /Text>

<Text>The food tastes good....BUT ....instead of a fork , they gave me two butter knives. They used to give enough pita to go with your food. Now , they gave me less than half a pita ....like 3 bites. So im trying to eat rice with no fork. Next time....i will go someplace else.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

It was “ok” Mediterranean food. I tried both the chicken and beef kebab. Chicken was definitely better. Steak was too dry imo. This restaurant is in the Galleria food court. It’s always busy and the food takes 20-30 minutes. 100% self serve. They will give you grilled jalapeño if you ask for it as well.< /text>

Really Bad customer service! I've waited and standing there for more than 30mins! And ask twice about my order! And this girl manager didnt say SORRY FOR KEEP YOU WAITING! NO APOLOGIZE CAME FROM HER! and didnt tell happened to my order! I guess they put the wrong pager no. Thats why it didnt buzzed my no. This happend 8/6/2019 at 1:33pm. I lose my appetite by waiting so long! You should guys fired that manager! Doesn't know what customer service is!?!< /text>

Food is decent but less than desirable service. Not properly staffed, food takes wayyy too long for a mall venue. I waited half hour for my food!</Review>

<review>Middle East blood runs in my vains what you what me to said about Kabbob? 😁
I LOVE IT 😁
This specific flavor from Massis it's delicious
From ALL chicken Kabbob i been trying in LA this is my favorite flavor.
Always pack but worth the taste.

The seasoning of the chicken was not enough hence not enough flavor and the rice was too oily for some reason. Good portion size though.</Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>Excellent food. I ordered through Eat 24, got 2 falafel wraps & a falafel plate. the plate cost more but had more food overall. Everything was heavenly. I'm very picky about Mediterranean food and rarely am happy with what I get, so this place really impressed me. Also got the side of dolmas, 4 for $3 which was a great price, and they were perfect! Would definitely eat here again. I'm thinking about it right now!<//text>< pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Terrible.  Terrible.  Terrible.   Just went to get two beef kabob plates to go.    There was no meet just tomatoe, rice, and pita bread.   Looked like they gave me someone else's left overs.    Not what they show in the pictures and definitely not worth it.   I called to complain and their attitude is "too bad, too sad."    Customer service is the worst and quality of food below one star.   Don't waste your money.<//text>< pictures>

Dry chicken kabob.
Oily rice. Oil runs under the rice. Not pleasant. Food takes forever to get out, given it's a mall food court.< /text>

Dzer tsavu tanem. The kabobs here are some of the best and the rice is delicious and cooked to perfection. You get alot for your money here! Every time I come hungry I leave very full and satisfied. I am Armenian so I know what good Armenian food tastes like and I have to admit this is very good. Please give them a visit!!🇦🇲❤< /Text>

<Text>I used to love this place until ...?
The quality of food has changed to the BLAAAA!
The rice taste yacky unlike before.
Even the side salad, not like before.
The portion on the chicken kabob has shrink and doesn't taste like before.
I understand they need to rised the price, but the quality went down the toilet. I won't buy from them no more.
The owner seems to be put of touch, or who ever is in charged doesn't care.
Good bye Maasis Kabob... feed your foods to the pigs.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<response>None</response><text>These people have not only bad service but also bad ‘Halal Menu’ food!!! Their portions of food is getting smaller but the price is going higher. I tried this place before and it was all good before. But now they lost the touch.

The manager was very rude when I told him there was too much salt in the meat. I couldn’t eat it. I even took a sample (untouched) for him to try. He throws it to the trash and never returned my money.

I love kabab and I tried the kabab place all halal
“Meditterranian Delight” across the street and OMG!! Only if people knew about this place.. they have all halal and healthy meats. 4 times better in food portions and taste.

If you are reading this try it and you will thank me. It’s across the street on Americana side.< /text><rating>1<//rating><username>Bangla Rkstar</username>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) It is not what I thought. I take a fiasco on the menu the piece of meat looks bigger and when they give you your order it is more rice and the meat a very limited ration.
