Great dentist. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. Came in for tooth pain. Xrays showed root canal. Sent me to an fantastic endodontist same day. Came back here to do the crown. Built right there in a cnc mill. Much cheaper crown than i was expecting and came out great, and tooth colored!

Highly recommend these guys. Hi tech and very friendly.< /review>

I really like this dentist. The people here are friendly and professional! The equipment and technology that they use is awesome. They have tools to take pictures of your teeth so you can see how your teeth are changing over time and how the treatments are affecting/fixing/whitening your teeth. The whole office just feels very modern, clean, and organized.

They are also up front about costs and develop treatment plans to help you understand what you're paying for.

Overall, great dentist. Highly recommend.</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><date>1614296772249</date><Review>I wish I could recommend this office, but sadly I cannot. They seem friendly and competent but if you need anything substantial - heed my tale. In October I went in for a routine cleaning. I was told I needed one filling and referred to an endodontist for pain in another tooth. So far, so good. When my trip to the endodontist ended in a cracked tooth and the need for another crown I returned to Del Sur. After partially numbing my mouth and leaning me back in the dental chair the office manager came in and said I had used all my annual benefits and shoved a $1200 bill in my face and said that I had to give them a credit card right then and there, which I did. However, they also billed my insurance which paid them and resulted in an $800  credit to my account which they never acknowledged, forcing me to do a charge-back on my credit card. On top of that they didn’t finish the crown on my cracked tooth instead sending me to an oral surgeon. So now I have no crown and no way to get another crown because they’ve already billed my insurance and been paid for a service they didn’t provide. On top of that they won’t even schedule an appointment for me to have the service done there until I pay them the “balance” on my account (for a service they still haven’t provided!!). Folks, this is not the right way to treat a patient who needs your service. There are plenty of good dentists in RB. Save yourselves and go somewhere else.<//Review>< Name>

Everyone at this location is absolutely amazing, and so kind. From the moment you step in, you are greeted with a huge smile, & quickly taken care of. I had an appointment yesterday to get my teeth fixed since I dropped my phone on my face (lol) and ended up chipping my front teeth. My teeth were left as if they were never chipped, beautiful. The two wonderful ladies who took care of me were so fun to be around as well (thank you!!). I also had a routine cleaning a few days ago, and had an amazing experience as well.

Very professional, walked me through every step of the process for my care,  and medical attention required was clear and concise. Excellent service from start to finish. I was given fast, efficient, and effective care. The staff was very personable and made sure I understood all aspects of service provided. I was always at ease in the office and enjoyed talking with every member of their team. Would highly recommend!<//review>

As a new patient having moved to the area recently, I was super impressed on the fabulous experience!  The equipment is all state of the art, but the best part was the staff and Dr. Still.  I usually am nervous when getting dental work done, but no more.  They are so gentle and very caring!  Nicely done everyone!</review>

I called the day before, letting them know that my tooth really hurt and I was wondering if they could fit me in the next day since I'd be there anyway with my husband. They couldn't guarantee it over the phone, so they secured me an appointment for their next available, but told me to come in anyway with my husband like I was planning, just in case. I did so, and the doctor quickly checked me out and did a couple of tests while I was there. Turned out I needed a referral to the endodontist, he put that in, and I was even able to get an appointment with them that afternoon to do a root canal. It is now Saturday and I am out of pain. So thankful for this office. They really go above and beyond for their patients. Dawn at the front is so kind, Taylor and Renee are funny and nice and respectful, and Drs Lopp and Dovey are professional and accommodating.

Words will not serve me how good this dental office is because of the amazing staff.
The skills, equipment, environment, as well as all the little details to make the dental visit as comfortable and successful as possible.
I have one of the weirdest teeth that shifts in a very unpredictable manner so every time I have new filling I would end up ((no matter how much work has happened in the clinic)) I would end up with massive headache because of a high bite or a different bite, I had this issue  since I was a child until now, I always have to return many times until it's settled in the right shape however with the doctor skills in this office ,  it started with two visits then no more than the same visit needed to get the bite right!!  it's just amazing .. plus other things such as the highest bar cleanness I have seen in any dental office, the professionalism , the equipment and care that they provide to me and my family..... we actually moved from the area but I still do the drive because I don't think I can find as good as this practice...< /review>

Best Dental Experience Ever!

Dr. Still and her entire team have created the perfect dental experience. I have had several dental procedures recently, and I am thrilled to share that my experience at Del Sur Ranch Dental has been phenomenal!

Dr. Still is very knowledgeable, highly skilled, and has a great sense of humor!  Actually, the entire team is the same way. Whether you are walking in the front door or sitting in their chair each team member is competent, caring and friendly.

Never thought I would say this, but it is true...        I LOVE GOING TO THE DENTIST!</text>

<Text>Worst service ever I have ever received in my life. I will never go back or recommend it to anyone. I received your phone call today. I came to your office three times about severe pain after the first and second procedure then I came for cleaning my teeth and I mentioned again the constant still pain all this happened in less then an eight days period then I called your office they answered and I was denied to come and see you and referring me to another endodontics which I did to end the pain. The least I can say to save time and money is having a right diagnosis from a start point. Especially when a dentist would rather refer you to another dentist than fix her mistake.<//Text>< Pics>

Nobody usually looks forward to going to the dentist like I do. Dr Jennifer Still and team are the friendliest, most knowledgeable, affordable and caring office I have ever experienced. I left a message that I had lost my crown, of course it was a weekend, but first thing Monday morning Doug returned my call, even before the office opened, offering me several immediate appointment options. From the moment I stepped in the door, I felt welcomed, comfortable and cared for.  Dr. Still has cutting edge technology so basically, what used to take weeks to deliver a crown now is done in same day visit. The hygienist was very informative, explaining each and every step of the process. Initially, I was concerned with the cost of a new crown, however Cindy,  also very informative, found that my dental insurance would cover half, and that Care Credit was an option for interest free payments for the remainder of the cost. I left the office with a beautiful crown and got my smile back. This was a painless experience and look forward to returning for my cleaning appointment with Renee, whom both my husband Mario and I find is just wonderful. Thank you to all of you shining stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//review>

Above and beyond!!! Always a wonderful experience at the Del Sur Ranch Dental Office with Dr. Still. They are so friendly, caring, professional, and excellent at what they do. They have state of the art equipment. I’ve been going there for the past 2.5 years. Yesterday I went in for a routine cleaning and found out one of my old huge fillings was no longer good and the tooth needed a crown. They were able to get me in the very next day (today). Also, yesterday and today I had some personal things going on with my family that was making me sad and today everyone at the office gave me a hug and I was given a beautiful bouquet of flowers. A huge thank you to everyone in that office. You all made my day a little brighter. If ever you want a fantastic dentist office, this is it.< /Text>

<Text>What an amazing team!! I had such a wonderful experience at Del Sur Ranch Dental.  As a new patient, I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I felt right at home when I walked in the building, because Doug and Dr Still welcomed me by name and with a smile!   Doug gave me a tour of the facility and it seemed like the whole team got to know me and actually asked how they can help me feel at ease.  Regina, dr still’s assistant, was wonderful. Renee did my cleaning, and did such a great job.. no pain at all (my teeth are very sensitive). They all made me feel very comfortable in their chairs.  Cindy the team leader made sure I had all of the information I needed before leaving, she is very friendly.  After the work was completed, Dr Still personally gave me a call a few days later to ask how I was feeling and if I had any questions.. what a nice touch!  Thank you, Del Sur Ranch team<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<review>They are all so friendly and welcoming and make the experience very comfortable. I was terrified of the dentist and hadn’t gone in awhile and they have completely alleviated me of that fear! I look forward to going to the dentist now which is something I never thought I would say. I definitely would recommend Del Sur Ranch Dental to anyone looking for a great dentist!<//review><user_id>110473369039900279117< /user_id><GmapID>0x80dbf6ff2dddb07b:0x20f835b4103641c<//GmapID>< Rating>

<text>Ladies and gentlemen if you were looking for the dental office of your dreams you've come to the right place. There are two girls up front that are going to wow you with their smiles and amazing customer service. The doctor is on point and knows what she's saying and I always leave with extra clean teeth! Definitely recommend this office and they take my insurance as well which is exciting. You don't need dental insurance for Dentistry however it definitely makes it a lot easier.< /text></record>

I’m so pleased to share my review of Del Sur Ranch Dental.  Their customer service and care to our family has been superior!  Specifically, they will go the extra mile to extend their services and ensure all care is up to the patient’s expectations and satisfaction every time.  Each time I have visited I have received outstanding care and concern from all staff from reception to the dentist.  I would say that I’m someone with extremely high standards and this practice certainly exceeds my needs.  I would strongly recommend Del Sur Dental to anyone looking for quality dental health care and excellence in customer service for their family.< /review>

< Review>
Nothing but 5 stars for the whole team! I want to start this review off by saying that I've had terrible dental anxiety ever since a bad experience about 10 years ago. I've come in once for X-rays and came back yesterday for pain in my front tooth which is capped because of a break several years ago. Turns out I needed a root canal! I was hesitant since going to the dentist is already so nerve racking, but the pain was excruciating so i agreed to the procedure. They were able to get me in the following day(today). I was accommodated so nicely! The whole staff was welcoming and extremely genuine. I had headphones and my choice of Netflix show for the whole procedure, the nitrous and blanket were a nice plus too! If you're looking for friendly, quick, clean, and welcoming dentistry experience look no more. My dental anxiety has been eased with the help of Dr. Still, Dr. Yazdi, Sydney and Doug! Thank you guys!!!!!!!!!!<//Review>

First off this office is beautiful! Secondly every single person who works there is so sweet nice and polite! I got my teeth whitened and it was such a calming cool experience! I watched a friends episode and just hung out. I loved that they didn’t push or upsell anything to me! My teeth look amazing too! I can’t wait to go back! I didn’t do any other dental work so I can’t speak for that but everything I did was a great experience! I recommend them for the teeth whitening!</Review>

< Review>
Management seems unprofessional. Hygienist wasn’t great. Almost poked me in the eye multiple times. Actually did poke me in the face with one of her instruments more than once. Needed assistance taking my blood pressure because she couldn’t work the machine. At one point she asked me a question regarding how to do what she was doing, really making me question her competency and the office managers capability of hiring qualified employees. Hygienist also openly complained about her personal issues with employees while standing right behind the chair I was in. Seems like there is a lot of drama going on behind the scenes and staff don’t know how to check their emotions at the door.<//Review>

They take TriCare/MetLife dental :) I would recommend this dentist to all military families as well as anyone looking for a new dentist. All of the staff are great and friendly! They do a good job of explaining everything about the practice as well as procedures on your first visit. Also the dentist is very thorough, I've moved around a lot and Dr. Kay is an exceptional dentist and trustworthy. Everyone makes sure you stay comfortable and pain free during you procedures.<//Text>

<Review>I was very uncomfortable with the interview process. I also think it's not being respectful of my time. The hygienist was nice, but past a very inappropriate comment relating a personal medical condition to my dental issues . They try to upsell big-time including a sneaky tube of 19.00 tooth paste.  The dentist was nice and mica was fantastic; So they each get a star.
The office was clean , but very unorganized administrative wise. Instead of a chart, everyone writes on scratch paper and they end up thumbing through chicken scratch.
State of the art forsure, maybe that's why the up-selling
Needless to say I will not be returning.<//Review>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><text>WOW!  Just wow!  This office is incredible.  As a nurse who HATES going to the dentist, I've spent my adult life searching for a dental office that I'm not quivering in their chair.  The entire team from front office, hygenist, assistant and Dr. Still all make you feel like family.  I've learned more about my teeth and how they can affect my general health in one visit there then I learned my entire life!  Two perfect crowns down... and 2 more to go!  With everything they taught me about oral care, I'm hoping I'll be visiting them for my cleaning and checkups in the future!   Keep up the 5* work Del Sur Ranch Dental.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dbf6ff2dddb07b:0x20f835b4103641c<//Gmap_id></record>

Very polite, excellent customer service. I was looking for a particular flavor and the employee working was very helpful with making sure I found what I wanted. The customer service alone is why I will continue to buy my vaping products here.</text>

Sold a broken item that they wouldn't exchange within 30 minutes and charged 10 dollars more on another item over what almost every other store in town has it priced at. Selection was alright quite a few people just hanging out inside which is not my favorite thing.</review>

<review>I'm not sure where these negative reviews are coming from. I had put off checking out this shop, even though it's a couple blocks from my house, because of the bad reviews. I finally stopped by, figuring I'd at least see what it's like and they surely would have the couple basics I needed at the time. After staying far longer than I'd planned, and spending quite a bit more than I intended, I've gotta say that this is easily one of the best shops in town. Their selection is larger and more complete than a lot of the shops around here, and included things I'd been looking for for a while. Great selection of premium e-liquid, mods (authentic and clones, so there's something for any budget), RDAs, tanks, accessories... It's all there. The guys behind the counter when I was there were awesome. All in all, I'm looking forward to going back. Check this place out!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80945c5927fb5deb:0xda766b4bb822625a< /GmapID></record>

Best shop I've seen so far. Satyr was the best till I walked into this place a couple days ago. This is like the Satyr SUPERSTORE.  Kinda has the same feel but bigger and better. Been vaping about 2yrs btw...</Review>

< Review>
Pros: great selection of juices
Cons: overpriced and on top of that I bought 2 coils for my atlantis and they didn't work right and after doing a bit or research turns out the were knockoff fake ones. I wouldn't recommend buying spare parts from this shop.< /Review>

<text>This Vape shop has nice supplies for vaping, and other various things you may find in other smoke shops. Friendly/helpful staff. As far as "VAPING" They could ADVOCATE for switching from cigarettes to vaping with the backup of the MEDICAL studies showing that Vaping is LESS harmful. They could update COILS (I.e to the newer/better/longer lasting MESH COILS- I would love to come by a LOCAL SHOP TO PURCHASE, BUT I CAN'T, I go online to purchase mesh coils as well other coils not carried locally), and atomizers, maybe a variety of salt nicotine juices as well as pod devices. But all-in-all I do enjoy the store and customer service.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
Josh is probably the coolest guy there. I think he should get at least 15 an hour. This one time he rebuilt my vape, while selling a 1000 bucks worth of juice to a customer, all while saving a cat from a burning building.  It was simply amazing, never seen anything like it. After he finished he knocked the dust off his shoulder and gave me a 5% discount for the wait. Truly the best vape shop ive ever been to.....< /Review>

<text>LOVED it here!! The manager Tyler was very helpful. He let us take our time and we didn't feel rushed. He also put our vape pens together and gave us careful instructions and answered all of our questions in a respectful way! My boyfriend and I have never Vaped before so if you are new to the vaping community you should definitely come check out this place! We will definitely be returning!

<review>Although they have great selection of juices and product I found staff be little less knowledgeable or willing to assist a beginner vapor. Twice I have spoke with two different staff members regarding a coil. Neither one of them could explain why or even offer to look at the coil to see what problem I was having. It was more of a shoulder shrug and I don't know response.

I spoke with the same employee and asked about juices. It's pretty obvious I'm a beginner, plus I told him I was, and I was looking for something I wasn't sure about. Never once did he question to solicit what I could possibly be looking for. I had to ask questions and try to pull information out from the employee.

I find it frustrating to have employees work for a store that appeared to only be there for the  free/discounted e-juice and to just hang out and vape with little knowledge about the recreation.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80945c5927fb5deb:0xda766b4bb822625a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Great store. Friendly and overall professional staff. Inventory on juice ad mods is without a doubt the best in town. In terms of a "chill spot" this shop is not really that store. That being said that's absoutely ok. This is a professional busniess there to sell you juice and vape gear you want and need. Prices are competitive for a brick and mortar shop. "Mom and pop." Of course most things you can find online cheaper but if you want to hold and inspect something youve been wanting and pay a comforatable mark up then this is the place. Lastly, the juice selection is incredible and prices are fair.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Only thing I have issue with is this dumpy manager guy. Creepy and annoying. I prefer to go when he is not there. Professional service, except for that sloppy annoying manager. Dresses like he is loungeing at a pool. Flip flops, bathing suite....weird! Over look the creeper, and all is awesome!< /review><gmap_id>0x80945c5927fb5deb:0xda766b4bb822625a<//gmap_id></record>

<review>TGI Vape engages in price discrimination. Customers who go to the store at one time of the day cannot be assured of paying the same price as customers during other parts of the day. Absent minded salespeople of no help whatsoever, who don't give out receipts. In total, this store clearly has its work cut out for it.</review></record>

Rude, dangerous staff. I went in their with a friend who was a beginner at building (been using cartos and RDAs that I'd built for him) but we both wanted to check this place out. He decided to get a build, and the man behind the counter thought a .1 or lower would be best for a beginner using a Stingray clone, to give them a "good experience". I insisted on something around .5 or even .6, but the man behind the counter didn't want to build something that a "customer wouldn't be happy with". Keep in mind that the guy he was building for was accustomed to carto tanks at 15 watts and most recently 1.2-1.6 single coils on an IPV 2. I've been in this place (by myself and with others) 6 times, and have never had a good experience.< /review>

Pretty decent, but vaping is a pretty new trend and tons of people like me have questions about the things we dont understand when it comes to vaping. I should FEEL like i can walk into a vape shop without being judged for not knowing the difference/effects between coil size for a mod. It's just really ego-ee there. There's 1 dude there who is pretty chill. (the shorter dude who likes impractical jokers) and the taller dude comes off as a total dick. With that being said I only come here for specific oils. Satyr Vapor and Royal Vapes are the best for when you wanna sit around, chat, try new flavors and they excel when it comes to customer service.< /review>

I only go here if Satyr is out of what I need. I don't appreciate waiting 15mins to purchase juice while being ignored for more scantily clad customers.</Review>

<Text>My favorite local beer bar in the inland empire.  It's a historic building in Highland California.  The beer on tap is always ice cold.  The bartenders are quick to serve you and are always smiling.  The patio is open to enjoy the crisp fresh air and you are allowed to smoke out there as well as sip on your ice cold beer.  See you there< /Text><Resp>None</Resp>< rating>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>A nice Highland surprise! Had not heard of The Belle, until owner Martha hosted a mixer for the Highland Area Chamber of Commerce.  This is a very comfortable wine and beer bar, with reasonable prices, and it's an historical part of the Highland community.  Be sure to ask Martha about the poem, she will be glad to recite!  Only parking is on the street   The Belle is open during the day, so if you get there early, grab a seat at the bar to watch Sat & Sun football  - 2 TVs. Screens are a little small for table viewing, but there are five or six 4-top tables.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

They claim they have karoke, but only if the Kj feels like it! If they set up then people will come! The bar tender told me I could participate if I brought people! Very unprofessional. I wonder if Martha knows they are running her bar into the ground. And I really hope she isnt paying that KJ!</review>

Delicious authentic Mexican food! Get the mole! You definitely won't regret it! The lunch deal is great! The chips and salsa are very good and they come by to fill them back up often. Definitely a great small place not to miss!< /Review>

Homemade, fresh, and family- owned delicious Mexican restaurant... The service was quick, friendly, and accommodating. The ambience felt very authentic.  Great for bigger parties with 8 or more. Also delightful for a couples, date-night lunch or dinner.  They have a kid's menu too! The parking is limited but be patient, a stall will open up! The owner is so warm, friendly, and wants "the best" cuisine for their customers and it reveals itself on the first bite.  I/we enjoyed it tremendously and are anxious to return weekly! God's blessing to you all!  Enjoy😍< /Review>

<text>Our first official dinner date at Lupita's and two years later, our waitress still remembers us!  Very personable with great service.  I compare all Mexican restaurants to this one in the Sacramento area.  No one has beat their great tasting authentic Mexican food yet!  Great salsa, beans and my favorite, cheese enchiladas and chili relleno.  Good prices too!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The food here is A++.   For the price I don't know why anyone would go anywhere else.  Make sure you bring cash, keeps the prices lower.  I can eat lunch there,  leave a tip and it only sets me back 10 bucks.  That is with me just drinking a cold  glass water.    They serve chips and salsa as well.   What makes this place shine about all the rest, what gives its luster is the service.  The friendliness of  staff is fantastic.  The positivity is recharging.  What are you waiting for?  Go now and experience this great food.</Review>

I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Me and John have been coming here for years and it is our go to place for Mexican food. They make the best tacos and the rice and beans are prepared exactly how I like them. Best of all, the taco shells are fresh and never from a box. Try Lupitas once and I’m sure you will come back. Thank you Maria!< /Text>

I was very impressed. It was favorfull. We cleaned up our plate which is something we never do. The chicken enchilada sauce was delicious and the rice was also delicious. I also had the chicken mole which was the most delicious I had ever tasted. Overall it was yummy and will be going back.</text>< Pics>

<review>Slow service.  Especially for Mexican...  Maybe it was bad timing?  The waitress said they only had one cook.  On a Saturday night?  Waited to order, then waited forever for food to arrive.

Very loud.  Don’t come here if you have trouble hearing.

Food is mediocre. Smaller portions than expected.  Rice and beans are bland.  No “salad” on my plate.  Really everything seems bland.

Margaritas are blah.  Wine I think.  Salsa bland, but fresh. Friendly staff.<//review><username>Deb H</username><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

We ate here last month and the portion sizes were very small. My friend from Modesto and her husband liked the food but me and my other friend thought the chips and salsa were good but that's it. We won't be coming back the food isn't good enough.< /text>

Very fresh for a reasonable price. This is coming from a dweller of Sacramento. I was expecting slightly chewy but nope. Not this place. Must be all their white customers giving good business.</review>

We have been coming to Lupitas for years and they cook the most authentic mexican food in Sacramento y ellos hablan español así que si buscas cocinar en familia this is your place. The prices are very inexpensive so a perfect place for a date night. I get the chicken enchilada and shredded beef taco with beans n rice. My wife gets the chicken enchilada with rice and my 12 year old daughter gets a plate of beans. Just writing about it makes me hungry lol and i was there yesterday. Gracias Lupe y familia for always doing such a great job!</Text>< Pictures>

<rating>2</rating><Text>I'm not picky when it comes to Mexican food.  We ordered takeout from here, steak and shrimp fajitas. The portions were small for a typical restaurant, the veggies were on the soggy side, the tortillas were stuck together and the chips were stale. I really wish it was a good review but I found the food lacking. Will give it a 2nd chance, though the first time I was very disappointed.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Very comfortable, pleasant restaurant. Menu shows all of the expected Mexican dishes at  very reasonable prices. We had entrees of tacos, chile relleno and beef enchiladas, rice and whole beens. Very tasty, beautifully prepared with very fresh ingredients. We will be back to explore Lupita's offerings when we have more time. We enjoyed ourselves. We'll be back.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>Dirty tables, the guy who brought us drinks spilled an entire soda on my boyfriend, nobody even came out to apologize or even offer some free guacamole?? The waitress was very argumentative and rude to us...terrible service!!! We just left at that point. I've never left any food establishment after sitting down except for this place. I honestly don't know how they pass their health inspection. I would give zero stars if I could.< /Review>< pics>

They rushed us to finish our dinners and it was 12 min to 8pm. They close at 8. I'm sorry but change the hours then but don't rush customers cuz you want to skip out early.< /Review>

This place has real authentic Mexican food that is to die for its the best of the best. I grew up in Los Angeles so this is a huge compliment because there is Mexican food on every corner the canita's plate is amazing and so is everything else on the menu grandma Lupitas treats and loves my family as if there an extension of her own family my kids call her grandma and they love her and look forward to seeing her and eating here.. I highly recommend to everyone very nice not to formal down to earth hospitality. Please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to Lupitas.</text>

Lupitas is my favorite mexican restaurant hands down! The food is amazing and homemade. Chips and salsa as soon as you sit down and a very friendly atmosphere. I have been going to Lupitas for over 15 years and I have never had a bad experiance. I go here at least twice a month, as I board my horses right down the street. If you like Chicken Enchilatas, you won't find better in the area.
I tell everyone I know about this place and I get the same response......Great Mexican Food!!! I love Lupitas!< /Text>

<time>1265340064661< /time><rating>4< /rating><text>With the price of eating out so high... the value vs price... this is a wonderful place to eat. The food taste wonderful. presentation could be a little better. Not as fancy as garcia's or el toritos.
But about 1/2 the price!
But the thrill of a sit down mexican restaurant is the chips and salsa. And they are great!
A little hard on the eye's and need to remind them for something you asked for...
But thats what you would get in your mom's kitchen... and it feels like family...
Taking a date there tonight for the thrill of a hole in the wall meeting...</text>< Pics>

I don't care that you are giving me microwaved food, but if you are microwaving, at least use something that is not harmful. Will not be going there again.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Review>Tasty Donut is pretty much my go to donut shop, the owners are very friendly and I appreciate the entrepreneurship the young lady and her brother have that own it.   I get donuts every Friday for my work and never had a single complaint about these ones, they just taste better than a lot of the other shops around and they always look picture perfect.  Also they have a lot of really good breakfast sandwich items they make, my one suggestion would be that they should definitely have someone there in the mornings specifically to cook the breakfast sandwiches while the other employee serves donuts.</Review><username>ANTZ</username>< Pics>

Overpriced. Donuts are just regular donuts. Not bad but nothing special. Nice that bagels are offered but be prepared to pay $4 and up for one bagel! Wouldn't recommend unless it's conveniently close and you're in a hurry.   Coffee is ok. Only regular creamer & the pink or blue sweeteners offered.< /text>

A great selection of donuts and very tasty too; No pun intended. The service was fast and friendly; and a good cup of coffee as well.
Very reasonably priced. I have returned on a number of occasions.<//Text>

I appreciate the service, after we waited at the counter for over five minutes to get someone's attention. But overall the quality is just not there. We paid over ten bucks for a dozen when the donuts didn't even have good flavor to them. We have had alot better in town and for a few dollars cheaper. The glaze on the chocolate and the strawberry didn't taste good at all. The glaze was "ok" but the fluffiness from the donut completely sank down once you bit into it, like a donut filled with air. Honestly if I had to choose, I'd go down to Scotty's on Walnut opposed to here.</Text>

First off I will agree with everyone else's remarks in regards to the service. The lady behind the counter is very friendly and attentive even though she is the only one behind the counter.

They do have quite a huge selection of donuts. i just had a maple bar, I tried playing it safe. It did taste different than my usual spot, but it was still good. Different, but good if that makes any sense.

The esthetics aren't anything to write home about, but come on your also not walking into some fancy bakery, but at the end of it all the donut was "tasty."

Furthermore to the ones that say the coffee isn't special, last time i checked you weren't walking into a bakery, cafe, or a Starbucks. Farmer Bros coffee or not it still did the trick.< /text>

If I could give a negative 5 star review I would. Idk everyone's lying about the quality of service and food here.
Hours are lies, they close whenever they want to, usually 10am. This place had the crappiest customer service.
They honestly close at 9 or 10 am every single day! Every day! Every timI attempt to eat there the lazy person there says "oh you can get donuts but I'm not cooking anything". Why false advertising?</text><Gmap_id>0x80952f9e5ba3081b:0x6ded8a086e8d78fa</Gmap_id></record>

The whole car rental deal wasn’t actually bad but what makes it unpleasant was that the rental agent specifically told me that if I returned the car after 5 pm and as long as the keys were in the drop box before they opened the next morning that I wouldn’t be charged an extra day’s fee. So, I took my time to finish my work and dropped it off before 5:30 and when I got the bill I was charged anyway. Had the agent not said that, I would have left my work earlier and dropped the car off by 5 pm. Just feels shady like a bait and switch tactic that leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Not cool and not the best business practice<//Text>

Hidden $200 deposit screwed me. Had to stay in an unfamiliar town overnight to get enough money on my card. Staff at first location were just bad human beings. Honestly what can you expect? It's a nationwide corporation with no concern for working class people. Overall horrible experience, would have never used them if I had any other reasonable options, hope I never feel the need to use them again.<//Text>

Pluses...Much more professional that 2 years ago.  Toyota no available, received an upgrade at no extra charge.  Deposit refunded within 48 hours.  Negatives...no AAA discount and tire pressure notification came on during rental period.</review>

My wife went online and reserved our vehicle. Submitting all the information they ask for online definitely makes the process easier. We got there, they met us outside, they pulled the car up we signed the tablet she had she went inside and processed the payment and we were able to go. Returning it was super easy too...we came back, handed them the keys and left. The deposit was refunded 2 days later. We will definitely be using them again!< /Text>

The car I rented from Enterprise performed fine, and the staff at the beginning and end points were gracious and understanding. I was disappointed when, after a couple of minutes driving the car, the "needs maintenance" sign lit up.  Obviously it had been lit before my time with the car, so I wondered how long the car had been driven with this warning light on.  I didn't have a long way to drive, from Petaluma, CA to San Francisco (maybe 40 miles) and then from San Francisco center to the SFO airport. (another 15 miles?) The car performed fine, but it is worrisome and disappointing to pay $85 a day for a car and then have to worry that it isn't in top condition, and may give you a problem somewhere unexpectedly.<//text>

<Time>1582735724990</Time><Rate>2</Rate><text>This location very seldom has a good selection of cars, but I was able to get one and upon my return they charged me for gas. I had just filled up the tank to the same level it was when I received it, just under 3/4, which is irritating to begin with.  Cars should be full when rented out so the renter doesn’t have to try and figure out exactly where it should be!!
Anyway, they charged me for 7 gallons of gas at $6/gallon!! If I was off at all it would have been by no more than a gallon AT THE MOST! I sent an email and received NO RESPONSE, but three days later I get a request for a review, so here it is Enterprise. I’ll rent elsewhere from now on.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Sara & Manny  were a Huge help, our production company had a last minute need for 2 SUV's to go to Vegas and they had them ready to go
the moment we arrived - less then 30 mins later.
Also, the location in Vegas bothched the Billing and created a hassle
due to some confusion with a new employee ( not her fault, just a small
misunderstanding which was cured with a short call to Sara at the Petaluma
location. Sara has come thru for us on very short notice a few times and
the Petaluma and Auburn CA locations are fantastic.
Thanks again<//text>

Not the best customer service in the office. I made this reservation on line. They gave me an "up-grade" at the location, because they did not have the economy car I reserved,( so why not tell me there were none available?) than tried to charge me 39.99 a day insurance. When I declined they then said I had to pay a minimum of 19.99 per day because it was a bigger car. I booked an economy and wanted to only pay 9.99 per day insurance. I was going refuse the rental altogether, than low and behold there IS an economy car after all, it just came in while I was at lunch......So great got the car and the insurance amount I wanted to pay, car was dirty and smelled. She did try and wash it herself to make it all right, therefore I will give here that. So, fast forward 5 days, I return the car and as I am getting a ride home, I was then informed that I could have, and should have been offered the weekend special of $9.99 per day Friday-Monday, (100 miles per day). Than charge me the rate of 22.99 for the other two day(unlimited miles) I drove a total of 527 miles.

So people book on line, look for specials, insist on getting what you booked and don't accept any BS and Used car sales tactics.....once they get your money they are not going to give any of it back. Oh no help with on-line customer service either, very rude. One lied and the other just didn't care.

I will continue to rent from Enterprise but I will drive to the one in San Rafael on Midway to be treated with respect and honesty.<//review>

I wish I can give zero star . I got very bad experience with the manager I guess name is Matt . I booked 7 seater minivan with 5 bags capacity . The manager called before 1 hr pickup time and told that I’d not available instead he gave me SUV which was very compact . It was very difficult for my old father in law to sit at back . Also we have drop luggage because we have to take 2 strollers . The bad thing is at last moment he did that and I could not cancel because of my hotel bookings . On top of that that manager was so rude he was telling you can not get bigger vehicle you have to use that . I am not going to use enterprise again . I like hertz experience they are very sensitive to customer satisfaction. The most worst experience I got . I  decided to not use enterprise services and decided to walk after vehicle drop instead of using their drop off facility . No to enterprise again< /text>

The Petaluma Enterprise store is staffed by an excellent group of employees. The transaction is always quick. After I return the car I always get a ride back to my business very quickly. The driver has been there a long time. He is a nice gentleman and I feel safe when he is driving.< /Review>

Great experience renting a car for the weekend. The E team was courteous, professional and very resourceful. I messed up my online reservation and they were able to fix it and give me the same deal. I also left something in the car and it was as easy as picking up the phone and someone ran out to retrieve it for me. Great customer service - very high touch.< /text>

<Text>The service was great and the car was waiting for me upon my arrival. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the gas tank was only at  3/8 of a tank full. It was a drag to have to go fill the car up before I left on my trip.  All the cars should be full when a customer comes to pick up a rental.  Pick it up full bring it back full. The car had just been washed (it was wet when I received it) but once it dried there was some sticky stuff on the drivers door, so probably just hosed down.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>To be avoided as much as possible, poor reception, aggressive staff (maybe because we were under 25 years old?), no discussion possible, I felt threatened and insecure. I have traveled extensively to the US and Europe before, and I have never been so uncomfortably surprised. I strongly don't recommend this car rental company.</Review>< Pictures>

Have been renting a car every weekend since the $9.99 weekend special started out November last. I book online and there's always a car available for me. Staff are very friendly. Excellent customer service.  I always end up renting the car for an extra two to three days every time I rent a car. I am very satisfied to say the least.< /text>

< review>
I always choose Enterprise when I visit my family in Petaluma, California.
The rental staff have a real positive attitude and as a result I always leave with my car in a great mood. This is not always the case at other car rental agencies. I often utilize the pick up service and this is a big bonus.
Great service with a big smile - Outstanding!<//review>

The only problem I have is when I specifically ask for a compact/small car, and I get the next size up at the more expensive price. I should not have to pay more, when I reserve well in advance for the smallest size. Other than that, I have no problems with Enterprise or their staff.

I needed a car for only one day when my car was in the shop for repairs, and the people at Enterprise dealt with it quickly and professionally. No waiting, a good car, and friendly service. Couldn't have been easier or better.< /Review>

Their customer service is poor.  This is my 3rd time reserving a mini-van with the Petaluma location and only once they got my reservation correct.  The 1st time, they canceled my reservation with no notice and now - today, they are trying to give me an SUV with no cargo space instead of a minivan that I have reserved for over 2 months ago.  I am so upset right now I just want to scream.  What good is a reservation if they can't give me what I reserved.   These people can't even tell the difference between an SUV and a minivan.</text>

<Review>The personal service I received from this branch, and have come to expect generally from Enterprise, is really extraordinary. Haley, the manager, is down-to-earth, takes a personal interest in her customers and offers high attention to detail. Other companies could learn a lot from Enterprise and hiring people like Haley.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< username>

<Text>I asked for the smallest cheapest deal they had and I ended up paying more than any other time I rented a car from this company. The best part was comparing to the offer you get in your email: $9.99 a day on weekend. I payed $86 for two days! So no I wasn't very happy this time... Overpriced!!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>So, to start off I had a terrible experience here. I came in with my boyfriend because our car broke down and we needed to get back to our university in Washington  before the end of spring break. We called in and the gentleman who answered the phone assured us that we would be able to rent even though we didnt have a credit card with other pieces of information. We showed up and were met with an extremely rude and frankly stuck up employee who informed us that we couldn't. Now I understand that company policy is strict but we are hard working students and it was extremely frustrating to come across such implorable service. If you are having a difficult travel experience or look young, do not go to this company or this branch.</Review>< resp>

Recent car rental was very helpful when mine was  in body shop. It was my understanding that the body shop made  the  rental  reservation. However when I got to Enterprise no reservation had been made. Enterprise took care of me despite a lack of cars on lot. The car they did give me though had a horrendous smell inside rhat  i didnt fully appreciate until i left of course, and lot closed. Next day they allowed me to replace the car with a choice od cars and apologized for smell  and inconvenience.  As always enterprise did great service and fixed the issues without much delay for me. Thank you.</review>

<text>In the past I have had a generally positive experience at Petaluma Enterprise; my recent experience not so much. I returned a car exactly 1 week to the hour after I rented it, but because the return was on Labor day, there was no one to check me in. When I received a receipt by email the next day, I noticed that I had been charged for a week plus one day. I called the office to get the bill corrected and was told that because my reservation had said I was going to return the car on the 8th day, they had no choice but to charge me. I explained that the reason the reservation showed a return on the 8th day was because their online reservation app wouldn't allow me to show that I would return the car the evening before. I have never had a problem of "returning a car early" and getting charged for time I didn't use a car (and I'm talking dozens of times). The Manager I spoke with was unhelpful and I waited two days for his regional Supervisor to call me back after leaving repeated messages. And when I called again there was no answer. My credit card is disputing the extra $75 charge...but it sure leaves a bad taste. BTW, my company probably spends about $500-1000/month on Enterprise Cars, wondering how they treat occasional users?<//text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>If you're a Coastie from Tracen Petaluma, Don't ever rent here. Worst experience ever. I called to make a reservation and asked for a pick up at a certain time. I called that morning to make sure and was told by a very rude man that they don't pick up at that time and the lady who told me that made a mistake.  Get it together enterprise! Then, I take Uber there to pick up the car and that same man was very rude. If you hate your job that much, quit!  Then, I drop the car off a day early.  A week later, get charged double the agreed price because they said I drove over a 100 miles past their limit, which was a complete lie. I wish I had taken a picture of the mileage before and after. But, I was just too excited to have a car. I learned my lesson. I don't ever write reviews, but I just want to warn every Coastie, don't ever go there. Like enterprise, but thanks to this location, never going there again.<//Review><name>Hybhrid Lilly< /name>< date>

I reserved a car online Sunday for a Monday morning pickup. I was given a larger, less fuel efficient vehicle for the quoted price but charged 50% MORE PER DAY for liability insurance.
The clerk with her obviously brand new $49.99 business degree with the emphasis on customer service told me that I had the option to decline insurance and they charged more for a "nicer" car. I told her I didn't want the larger less efficient car and shouldn't have to pay more but her unsatisfactory answer was that my only choice was to decline the insurance and therefore assume the liability for any possible damage myself. This answer was unacceptable but I took the car because I didn't have time to argue this unfair, unethical and possibly illegal practice.
Details are as follows: reserved 12/13 for 10AM Monday 12/14 Rental agreement #32ZMD4
Rude employee #E580KB   Vehicle Lic#7GSZ2094 Car#7KSX4T
Partly because of this business practice and partly because of the incompetent customer service, I will not rent from Enterprise again nor will I recommend Enterprise to the regular out-of -town guests who visit me and frequently need to rent cars.< /review>

My son plays hockey out of Vacaville Ice Sports complex so we are there alot. As far as older (now) rinks go its home and still one of our favorites. Friendly staff and they do a good job keeping it clean as can be.< /text>

This is a very nice place to have some fun! And it's open all year around! They have separate places for freestyle skating and tryouts/practices.
Shoes are in great condition, but not very comfortable, but they are rentals, so you can't expect more. If you want comfort- buy your own skates.
Locker system is a great idea, but be prepared, they accept only ¢25+¢25. Cafe accepts only cash. But they have ATM ready for you.

The rink is separated for the begginers and better skaters... They also have some buckets to lean on if you can't skate at all.
They also have supervises there if you need help.
It was a great experience. Will be going there soon again.</text>

I've Know About This Place Since I Was A Child, It Was Amazing To Visit Again. Walking In You'll Notice The Place Is Big, It Clean And The Staff Are Everywhere. The Staff Take Good Care Of Their Customers And Immediately Let You Know They Are There At The Door. The Presence And Atmosphere Is Great They Definitely Set Up For The Holidays. Restrooms Are Very Clean, Locker There To Keep Your Belongings Safe While Your On The Ice. Very Family Friendly And Feels Safe On The Ice And The Ice Was Very Clean. The Staff Checks On You While Skating, I Highly Recommend A Family Night, Or A Date Night After Dinner To Burn Those Calories And Great Quality Time For Some Fun Laughs And Epic Falls. Definitely Will Return.</text>

Amazing place to escape the heat! Went there with the significant other and it was 13 dollars to rent and you ice skate to your hearts content. They have a sectioned off area for begginers and give you a stack of buckets to help you balance until you're able to go at it on your own. Definitely taking my family here!< /text>

<Review>The ice rink surface was well taken care of and plenty of buckets were available for people who were inexperienced who needed something to hang on to. If you rent skates please be sure to look at them carefully before use to make sure things look right and safe for use. One rental skate my son recieved had a broken eyelet for the laces ankle high, making the skate very unsafe. After I informed the skate rental staff, they exchanged the rental skates without hesitation.<//Review>< Pictures>

It was a joyful time for the family. One worker Ronny/ Ronnie, I believe, taught my sister and two cousins how to ice skate. Overall it was a great time for the whole family, we'll definitely be coming back soon.</text>

<text>Never been in a slow Starbucks before. This one is the slowest! At least 10 minutes wait for coffee says the barista. Yikes!

This location should not accept mobile orders. People are cancelling their orders.<//text>< time>

<Review>Suzy at the counter didn't know there was a difference between cream and milk and placed the wrong order. The barista showed me the sticker when I asked him about the wrong looking cream. She seemed very offended when we both said that milk is different from cream. I went back to her and kindly asked if she was new and whether she got trained about the difference between milk and cream because I was concerned about how offended she seemed when we informed her about the difference. She said she'd been there for a long time and she totally knows the difference but she chose to place the wrong order because milk was the default setting. Unthinkable answer. What cashier intentionally places the wrong order for their customers? This is not a case of "you're ordering something we do not offer". It is literally the most common combination of orders ever at Starbucks out of my over a decade of frequenting it on multiple continents. Coffee with cream. Very rude throughout the process.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Such sassy service or lack thereof. Every time I’ve come here (three times) they have messed up my order somehow. When I point that out to them upon retrieving my drink, they ask me if I ordered it correctly. Ummm, yes, yes I did. I order the same drink with the same customizations every time. Poor CS and I’m sure NOT how Starbucks corporate imagines things to go. Also, it peeved one barista off so much that THEY got my order wrong that she purposefully poorly blended my frappe — it had ice chunks in it and that never happens otherwise.</Review><GmapID>0x8085806252ba720d:0x60517202c7207029<//GmapID>< time>

The drinks take forever and most of the time they are made wrong. I have never written a review before but the customer service and work ethic here is so incredibly poor that I feel I have to say something. Every time that I order any food that has to be heated, they screw it up. For example, I ordered a bagel one time and when I actually got the bagel, it looked like they had just torn it apart. Another time, I ordered a breakfast sandwich and when I went to take it out of the bag, it was all taken apart and looked like they had just thrown it into the oven without any care at all. Everybody who works there always seems like they are high as a kite and just offer terrible costumer service. The only polite one there is Lupe and she usually works the cash register. I do not recommend this place at all. It is so bad that I have started to go to the far superior Philz across the street, even though this Starbucks location is literally connects  to my building.</review>

<Text>This staff at this Starbucks are great, they remember everyone.  But mobile orders here on a workday morning are perhaps some of the worst experiences I've ever had.  It took them 30 minutes to get my order on 1/24/2019.  What's the point of a mobile order if it doesn't speed anything up?  In fact mobile orders have only lengthened the time for someone to get their order at this Starbucks.  Before Starbucks had mobile orders, I could be in and out of this Starbucks in 10 min.  They need to fix that.</Text>< pictures>

The best Starbucks I've visited, no question! I'm so surprised there are low ratings at this location, but I do believe it's due to the San Francisco fast-paced way of life, and this location often being busy (and then drinks taking long).

But the staff at this Starbucks is so incredibly wonderful and personable, that you feel welcomed each time you visit. In the very busy FiDi, it's sometimes difficult to connect and find baristas who work to put a smile on your face. These people do just that, while working hard to stay up with orders. I have visited over 30 times, and each time I left feeling more energized and happier than when I came in. When it's busy, it may take longer, but this place, and the people working, remind me what matters most and that it's okay to slow down. Prepare to leave with a smile. Thank you all!</Text>

This place is only great in the mornings because that's the only time they deliver great customer service. I used to be a regular in the afternoons too but their customer service is horrible so I now only go in the mornings. Giorgi and Lupe are the greatest baristas and only there in the mornings.  I would rate this location higher than a 3 if their customer service was as great as their morning crew.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>I would leave 0 stars if possible. Not respectful  to my time at all.

Came in to change tires and alignment. Stated it would take approximately 1.5-2 hours. Ended up taking 5 hours. When going home I noticed that my steering wheel alignment was off (it was fine prior). I call back to make an appointment, and ask them to make it for whatever works best for them. They stated 11. I show up at 11 and they say it’s going to be another 1.5-2 hours.

First time and last time I come here.<//Text>< pics>

<text>Only a single tire tech for a multi bay shop but the wait wasn't too awful.
The desk staff girl should apply as a service writer at an auto dealership  because she was quite skilled at running the cost up and complicating the task and transaction. But she was a bit young to convincingly sell the runaround given to accomplish our acceptance of the deal without rolling our eyes and shaking our heads. But one of the tires was a warrantee replacement so what are ya gonna do? Cant go somewhere else. Might as well grin and pay it. She was quite easy on the eyes tho which took the edge off of the price sting and wait.< /text>< pictures>

went to wheel Works on Mendocino Ave.  they had a good price on tires , and asked the technician to check my rear brakes as they would have the tires off .  the tech came into the waiting area and said my brakes needed replacing and he could not perform the work at this time and would give me an estimate . they gave me an estimate for $710.00 I hit the roof .
the next weekend I took truck to my nephew who is a mechanic and he said my brakes were in good condition and maybe would need replacing in a year . I think wheel works tech. was trying to rip me off , BEWARE</text>

Great experience. I will preface this review with that all I have done here is an oil change, and that is pretty hard to mess up.

With that being said their prices are relatively competitive for the area (40 for a 2016 ford focus with basic motorcraft 5w-30). But both times I have come in the guys working the counter have been personable and pleasant to talk to. The wait time isn't bad (maybe 45min?) and what really stuck out to me is that they didn't try to up-sell me at all. Which would have been easy to do with my tires getting low.

Good group of guys, decent price, decent wait time - def. a repeat.< /text>

Terrible customer service and do not honor warranty.  I WAS a customer for over 12 years.  I brought a car in with a punctured tire to be repaired.  Called me said they couldn't find it.  I said I saw it myself and they said they would double check and call me back, which they never did.  Two weeks later experienced same low pressure on the same tire and showed them the spot.  Took me 30 seconds to find.  They are obviously terrible at even the simplest tasks of their job.  After hours, they said they could not fix it because it was too close to the side wall.  In addition, I would have to replace all four tires because I did not have enough tread on them and that I would have to pay full price.  These were 60k mile warranty tires and they had less than 30k miles on them and the 1/2 life of the tread was not covered by the warranty.  Offered no apology for wasted time, short life of tires or care to even provide an explanation.  FYI, I was primarily dealing with the store manage on this issue.  The truth is they just don't care (management on down).  Customer service, efficiency, and quality products are their lowest priorities.  Making money is.  Everybody I have talked to regarding Wheelworks is disgusted by this company and now I am too.<//Review>

<UserId.>108305941824059146215< /UserId.><Review>I had a slow leak. Since they do free repairs, I took it to where I bought the tires. First, they try to charge me for the repair, which their website says is covered free. When I tell the manager, Robert, he makes me show him on their website, then says it will be free. Then Will tells me the tires are too worn to repair, and I need to buy 4 new tires for $1100. What? they only have 20k miles on them and are 65k tires, and I rotate about every 7k miles. I ask for my keys and will get the repair done elsewhere. Then Will returns to tell me, "oh, we can repair them afterall". RIP OFF!!! these guys will lie to your face, go somewhere else. I also called their customer service number and nobody there wants to hear about this scamming location. I used to love them and have bought 6-8 sets of tires there, but not anymore.</Review><Gmap_id>0x8084478af5a871df:0xbe2df8eae7c8ec0a<//Gmap_id><time>1495671994392</time></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1515991662304< /Time><Resp>None</Resp><Text>You put a lot of trust in someone when you give them the keys to your car even for routine maintenance. I have trusted these guys, Wheel Works and the dozens of people that get moved in and out of there regularly, with my vehicles. One vehicle in specific has been exclusively serviced by these folks. They're friendly most of the time, nice guys, usually honest and quick to respond. I've had a oil drain bolt rounded off by a genius with a pipe wrench of all things, drain plugs loosened and tighten with an impact wrench, sold the wrong size wheel and then had no one tell me for two years why the dozens of alignments never worked, Lord knows they've just cranked down on the lugs to get me to leave all this time. Oil and filters changes that seemed to not be the correct amount, type, or the oil change may have been skipped outright. The most recent thing, the final straw, I was told there is hair line fractures on my oil pan on the vehicle exclusively serviced by them. The fractures radiate out from the drain plug threads, I was told it's because I've probably bottomed out too many times or it might have something to do with being in an accident, but there is no damage to the the bottom of the pan from every bottoming out, and I've never been in a serious accident.... no off roading, extreme weather or acts of god that can explain this away. I asked that they tell me the truth, that it looks like it's been over tightened repeatedly and since they were the only ones to service that vehicle that they should just be honest with me. Nope they couldn't, I was given a quote for a $500 repair, half parts cost and half labor at 2.5 hours. I'm done with this place. Corporate asked me once who the store manager was before they could help me, seems like even corporate is distanced and has no idea or interest in what's happening within their satellites. It's with a heavy heart that I move away from these guys but I can't afford to pay someone to cause my vehicles damage.</Text>< rate>

I have found them to be very efficient, effective and professional. They know their stuff and I always feel valued as a customer. A shout out to Monica and the entire team in Santa Rosa and Petaluma. I use them and now that I am selling my car I recommend them to the buyers.< /text>

I made an appointment to have my oil changed and I ended up waiting 50 minutes without any updates. There was no representative available so I tool it upon myself to find an employee in the garage. I found that no cars were moved from when I first showed up and three employees engaged in a game with boisterous laughter. I'm glad they were having a good time...I guess! Needless to say I asked for my keys, which they said they didn't have (another bad thing!) and they eventually found, and I left.<//Text>

< review>
I've been bringing my car here for maintenance since I got it. Always friendly, excellent mechanics and a great waiting room. I bring it in once a year for whatever maintenance is necessary. My car still runs like new. It's a 2002 vw beetle. They have taken great care of me and my vw over the years. I hate to have to add this to my review but don't want anyone else to get scammed so here is my current review of wheel works. The manager has changed and they no longer do good work. I went in to have my car serviced and red water light checked. Turns out they didn't even change my oil but charged me for it. Also, when I drove away from wheel works, my water pump went out and did major damage to my perfect little car. It is now in the wrecking yard.<//review>

<Date>1534780124982<//Date><rate>2<//rate><Review>Mixed feelings. When I got my tires done they were great. Got them done quickly like promised and a good price. Also one popped and they replaced it at no charge. Great!!
Got my father in laws tires theb cuz my experience was so good. But the wait time was double what they told me it would be. There's only so much to explore with a 3 year old.
Recently hasn't been so great either. I called to ask a question about how much a part will be on my car, MARIO tells me "depends on the year and make of your car" and he says it twice like I dont understand that.  um .. DUH. I'm like.. well can you look it up?!? So he transfers me to someone else. Frustrating.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I had a set of tires put on by wheel works which they did fine on. They did offer to check my alignment for free, which is always a good idea when you've changed tires. When checked they informed me that the alignment did need to be done. So I said let's do it, I waited a total of about 3 and a half hours that day. The tech tried to do the alignment but informed me that he was unable to perform the alignment after about an hour and a half of trying and recommended I come back when his master tech was in. Which I agreed to do. Problem is I noticed that my car started making popping noises when I was turning after the service. When I went back the next day to ask to have the mistake fixed Doug a heavy set man who was running the store that day wanted me to leave my car there and said he was very busy but would get to it in a few hours or when he had a chance . I did not appreciate this answer from him, when a good company makes a mistake they will usually at least try to correct it right away and not ask that you waste your day while your car sits there not being worked on. I told Doug that I wanted him to make the mistake right and pretty quick to which he stated "we're very busy and I'm not going to do that for you, and that's final."  He then proceeded to make me feel like it was somehow my fault as if I'm responsible for the mistake, which is typical of businesses with extremely bad customer service. I was feeling very upset, and informed him I would complain about him. Doug stated "bye" and waved his hand at me as if to say get out of here. I left angry but controlled myself. I would not trust wheel works with your vehicle, especially with Doug running the show. I  DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU GO THERE ESPECIALLY NOT YOUR MOM, GRANDMA, SISTER, this guy seems like a trickster and is not to be trusted.</Review>< pictures>

• Staff disorganization</Text>

<text>Took my car in for a noise the left front tire was making. They suggested new tires, a bunch of fixes to the front left including tire rods, bearings. After 1500 dollars of work the noise was still present when they returned the car. I took it in again and they informed me the front left control arm was very badly worn and needed to be fixed before I continue driving. This repair was estimated at 1200.

The fact they did all the work on the front left and never noticed or mentioned the control arm suggests either incompetence or at worst, they scammed me.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Dr. Nassi has taken care of my dogs for many years. i appreciate that he gives me different options that we can approach and treat health issues depending on what i can afford. he isnt afraid to give his opinion and his transparency is key to managing hour expectations when faced with serious health problems. their fees are reasonable and rarely do i feel like they upsell or push products on me. i recommend him to other pet parents all the time. thank you dr. nassi!< /Review>

<Review>I have been taking my Chihuahua Daisy to Beverly Robertson Veterinary for over 3 years. Not only are they great with Daisy, but they show a genuine passion to making sure your pet s healthy. The place is always clean and I have never had to wait long for Daisy to be taken in. If you are looking for a place to take your pet, I highly recommend Beverly Robertson Veterinary. And if you want to get your pet groomed. There is a place right next door.</Review><resp>None< /resp><name>Scott Goldner< /name><gmap_id>0x80c2b9646c825871:0x392feed0b487f89e<//gmap_id><Date>1582648475348< /Date><user>112641722753995382480<//user><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

Today I took my little Chloe to see the doctor about a bump on the back of her neck. The staff was so friendly and took time to answer every question I had throughly. They were quite busy so you'll have to call ahead. I would recommend visiting because of the warm and friendly environment. It's a very well run office.</review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Truly compassionate! My family had to make the hardest decision of puting down our 17 year old dog, Snappy. I was truly terrified of not knowing what to expect. However, the staff handled everything with care and kindness. Due to covid restictrictions they had to take her in first and place her catheter. We waited in the car and then one of the staff came to get us. Once in, they had placed a blanket on top of the examination table. This was comforting for me, as my baby loved blankets, and I knew this would allow her to go peacefully. However, the doctor allowed my mother to hold her in her arms until then end and her passing was instantly and painless. Throughout the process, Dr.Gleason acknowledged the fact that our dog had lived a long and loving life and asked questions of the many things she enjoyed doing in life. At the end, she allowed us to stay and say our final goodbyes to her🙏🏻🐾🕊️💔. I am beyond grateful with Doctor Gleason as she is extremely professional and truly cares. I will definitely recommend this vet clinic to anyone.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Dr.Nassi is a caring and wonderful doctor! He  spayed our puppy 10 days ago without any complications. During the time the puppy was there,he personally called to update us about her status. He answered all of our questions before and after the procedure.
The office is so efficient and always on time on our appointments. Dr.Nassi has a great team of technicians who are there to take care of your pet and answer all your questions as well.
Thank you Dr. Nassi and your great team!<//Review>

Great place to take your pet for vet care.  Very caring staff and doctors.  They will discuss everything with you about the needs of your pet before they proceed with any care given.  I feel very fortunate to have found them.  I trust them completely with my pet's care.< /Review>

Jennifer helped us navigate the international relocation process with our dog, Trevor. She was super responsive and provided detailed, accurate information and put our mind completely at ease. Beverly Robertson really looked after Trevor for his various examinations and vaccinations. Would 100% recommend them.< /Text>

I have been taking my Chihuahua Daisy to Beverly Robertson Veterinary for over 3 years. Not only are they great with Daisy, but they show a genuine passion to making sure your pet s healthy. The place is always clean and I have never had to wait long for Daisy to be taken in. If you are looking for a place to take your pet, I highly recommend Beverly Robertson Veterinary. And if you want to get your pet groomed. There is a place right next door.< /Review>

<text>Great vet clinic in the West LA area! My dog was under Dr Gleason’s care for a year. She was always caring and very thorough with check ups and follow up explanations. She would also answer my questions (a lot of questions) promptly over email. The front desk and nursing staff are both fantastic. We’ve been to the Bay Area but would recommend anyone in LA who are looking to come here.</text>< Pics>

Beverly Robertson has been a wonderful vet to work with over the years. Dr. Nassi, Dr. Gleason, and the entire team is always helpful and kind. Front staff is always great, is nice, assists right away, and explains should you have questions. They will go out of their way to make you and your dog feel well taken care of and important. They’ve been especially helpful during the difficult times of covid, making it easy to do drop-offs, pick up meds, do exams, answer questions, and field emergencies. Ive trusted them with my dog, a service dog of 12 years, who now has seizures. They’ve gone above and beyond to make sure she has the correct medication, is doing well, and can quickly gets help if she needs for emergencies. They’ve given her a quality of life that she wouldn’t have had, expertly knowing how to take care of her. They’ve been there for any issue, small to large, emergencies and non-emergencies. I would definitely recommend BRV if you’re looking for a place that will take excellent care of your dog. They’ll also keep you well informed and assist you quickly if you have any needs. You can trust having your animal in the care of this vet and it’s dr’s, knowing they’ll do everything in their power to keep them healthy and safe.< /text>

They provided excellent - excellent - service for our pup who has had bad allergies for a while (itchiness and redness). I was a first time client looking to find a vet that feels like “family” as we had with our last vet before we moved but realized that with covid it would be hard to find. BRVC knows what they are doing and they do it well - they have you call them from the parking lot (plenty of parking) when you arrive and then they come take your pet. They are very loving towards each pet so that they don’t feel too scared/skeptical, you can see it. Made me feel great right off the bat. As for the visit, the doctor calls you while with your pet after examining them and takes their time with you. We have been doing the treatment they recommended for a few days now and our pup’s allergies are subsiding and on the mend. Bottom line - this is a wholesome vet clinic and we hope to be lifelong customers, so long as we still live in the area :)<//text>

Amazing service! I went there without an appointment because I had an emergency, they were so nice and accepted to check my dog.
The place is really clean, quite and the staff are nice!
It’s a private clinic so they don’t accept any insurance plans. The have parking space next to the clinic. Dr Nassi is super nice!!< /Review>

We brought our cat Albus for neutering and everything went well. The staff were very nice and caring. And the whole process seemed to went very well. The kitty is very active and there are no signs of stress or surgery at all. He is supper active and act like nothing happened. It's been 3 days from the surgery.</Review>

That's all you want for your beloved pets! There's a perfect reason why so many people come from different areas of the city to see Dr. Nassi: he's simply THE BEST. He'll treat you and your furry babies with love, respect and dignity. He's a serious and wonderful professional, and his staff is stellar! They'll give you great attention in and out of the clinic. Their ways of communication are very smart and they'll always make sure you're totally satisfied with their services. No ripoffs, no hidden fees, no unnecessary procedures. They're honest and amazing! Highly recommended!</Text>

<text>First off, the staff and the onsite Veterinarian are sweet, patient, accommodating and understanding of my feisty Chihuahua! They REALLY know how to handle her temperament! I am very picky and very much dislike handing my loved one to another technician or Vet but for some reason, I feel at ease leaving my dog with them. This clinic is the only one I will go to and have been doing so for years. The cost and value are more than reasonable (and I'm not rich by any means) so this is my go to spot. I love that despite being busy, they always manage to squeeze my loved one in and do excellent work! I would highly recommend Beverly Robertson Vet! A lovely establishment and super clean!<//text>< Rate>

<text>So I've brought my cat Ginger in here two times. The first experience was alright at best. I didn't find the staff to be very friendly, but they definitely weren't rude either. The veterinarian examined my cat and made some suggestions on flea meds and skin care. He was also not very engaging and borderline rude and curt. I was not offended as the purpose of the visit wasn't to make friends or have conversations or anything.

I think the deciding factor was on me bringing my cat back here was the pretty poor experience I had on my second visit. My cat was really distressed our her second time coming back here. Wasn't really sure why but the staff was not helpful, maybe it's because getting put in a small cage and getting poked by a stranger isn't her favorite activity. It was really awkward, and I felt like the staff couldn't be more annoyed that my cat was meowing in a stressful way. It was pretty apparent that they were annoyed with me. When I got in the see the veterinarian my cat had only become more distressed. While trying to examine my cat she tried to bat his hand away when he touched a sensitive spot. He snapped at me and asked if she was always this moody and upset. I understand the frustration, but I found it to be pretty unprofessional on his part. He rushed through the rest of the examination and left in a hurry.

My cat then had to get a shot, and they asked to take her to the back room to do so. I asked if they could do it with me in the examination room as I wasn't comfortable with any staff members handling my cat outside of my supervision at this point. The insisted multiple times that they had to do it in the back room, so I let them. Once they were done a staff member rushed out with my cat in her carrier almost all but dropped her on my lap and hurried away. She was incredibly scared and shaking. I just got her out of there and decided I was never coming back.

I have never been to a vet that seemed to care less about the animal they were seeing. These staff members don't come across as professionals who love animals. I get that animals can be jerks when they come into the vet, but in my past experiences it vets and staff members always tried to console the animal. I only went here due to the proximity to my apartment, and I will not be returning.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I have been coming here for 2 years now, just once each year for my cat's annual vaccines and physical.

I appreciate the cleanliness of the place, in the both the office and the clinic rooms. I also appreciate the confidence in the staff in how they handle animals - gently but firm, which is needed for a scaredy cat like mine that is always trying to run and hide.

I have never been pressured into any treatments or medicines, the Dr has given recommendations but has respected my choice to get/not get things that are not 100% necessary. He also has been really helpful in answering what may sound like dumb questions from me!

Point is: going to the vet is a headache no matter what, but these guys are clean, professional, and good at what they do!< /Review>

Went here for the first time and was disappointed by what happened. The vet was doing a vaccination and missed causing the vaccine to leak into the skin layers. What happened next? A vaccine reaction that sent us to a dermatologist to resolve because the dog got scabby bumps in several areas other than the injection site and a large red welt at the injection site. Biopsy results showed that the tissue at the injection site had some cell death. We had to give our dog 2 different medications for this which caused him to have diarrhea off and on for more than a month. The invoice also contradicts by describing the vaccine being administered at the right shoulder but it was not - it was the right flank. The vaccination certificate is also signed by a veterinarian that did not do the vaccination or the exam. Now a year later and they refuse to compensate us for youe damages. With all the good reviews we expected much better.<//Review>

I am extremely fortunate to live only a few blocks from Beverly Robertson Veterinary Clinic, but to be honest, even if it was a drive, I would still go there, because this is the best clinic I have been to in Los Angeles.  Having had cats for over thirty years, I have seen doctors at least ten clinics, and my experiences with Dr. Nassi surpass all others.  He and his staff LISTEN to you and don't just dismiss observations or concerns.  They are thorough and consider all possibilities.  And they're always on time!!  I give them the highest recommendation.<//review>

<Text>My 5-year-old pup was bit/stung by an insect during a routine walk, and she had an allergic reaction. Since we live super close, I took her to Beverly Robertson Vet Clinic right away. She was already a patient and was seen almost immediately. I feel they took good care of her and explained the treatment and cost to me as well quickly so that she could receive proper care. I'm pleased. This is the 3rd time we go here.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b9646c825871:0x392feed0b487f89e<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was not happy with my visit.  I was quoted a price for a teeth cleaning procedure for my cat, and when I got there was told it would be $200 to $300 more than my quote.  I understand there is a range, but that was ridiculous.  The people there were nice, and the doctor seemed qualified, but that should never have happened.  They said they weren't sure who quoted that to me, but that they "shouldn't have" quoted that low a price (and the price quoted was not cheap either).  I will not go back.< /review>

Excellent, effective care that puts my pets (and me) at ease, fantastic front office staff and technicians, and I never feel like I'm being sold goods, services, tests or treatments my pets don't really need.<//review>< GmapID>

<review>Dr. Nassi  is fantastic.  He and his staff are so passionate about what they do you can feel it as soon as you walk through the door.  I live in Santa Monica and there are many vet's between Lincoln and Robertson and this is my choice.  We drive for the best and, this clinic is the BEST.< /review>< time>

I found my new cat starving in my garden;  now I call her BK,  Big Kitty because she's back to healthy.  Dr Nassi prepared her care program
and shares his knowledge and advice,  and is very pleasant.
The staff obviously is kind to her,  because she's not unhappy there - for a cat that dives under the bed at ANY sound !!  and she's not freaked out when we return home,  which is a good sign - so there's no dreading the next visit !   Any questions ? feel free to speak with the front desk,  they are friendly and helpful too.</text>

Best vet I've been to so far, and I've been to many. This is the first time the vet didn't try to push expensive non necessary testing on my cat. Brought her in for an upper respiratory infection and he said we should try antibiotics and going from there, which makes so much sense! Also, the prices are super reasonable.< /text>

<review>They’re like a fast food restaurante.  In the nearly 2 years I brought my Dog here, I saw the Dr. twice.  Once was standing across the room from him.  We had a discussion about it and I thought it would get better.  Next time I brought my dog in with an issue, there was a new Dr. who seemed 12 years old and in my opinion, not experienced and offered diagnosis that was based in the clouds.  For regular wellness checks they’re probably fine. This office relys hevaly on “techs” who’s qualifications are unknown.  Not for me.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Rating>

Hands down this vet saved my daughter's beloved kitty. They are caring, compassionate, knowledgeable . They keep you in the know with updates on treatment, kudos to the front-desk staff. From the moment you walk in you know your pet and you are in good hands. Dr. Nassi is not just a vet but someone who really cares about your pet and that is what matters and makes the real difference. From the bottom of my heart, Shadow and I thank you.< /Text>

Dr. Nassi is by far the best vet I have even taken any of my pets to. He is caring and gentle and really has the best interest for your pet. He understands vet care can get expensive and really worked with me to figure out what is the best course of action for my pets. He has a wonderful loving staff who is always a pleasure to speak to and go the extra mile to help you with whatever you may need!< /review>

Dr. Nassi always goes out of his way to communicate with his patients. He and his staff are knowledgable and helpful. This recent visit was a quick visit to purchase flea medication. I was in and out before work but didn't feel rushed. As always, Dr. Nassi was able to answer all of my questions - even more than - once to ensure I fully understood.

10/10 our vet of choice.< /Text>

<Review>So pleased with my new doggie doctor! Brought in my pup when he started to exhibit discomfort knawing at his paws.  I had difficulty finding a practice,  including the one I had been using,  to treat it with any urgency when it started to become acute.  In spite of a full schedule and being a new patient,  they squeezed us in fast.  In addition,  the entire staff was very kind and understanding, including the protective/nervous nature of my dog around strangers,  especially in veterinary settings.  I was so impressed with how they handled everything,  I decided to make them my primary vet practice.  Needless to say,  their checkup was equally as thorough and they spent the time going over all this first time dog dad's questions. Highly recommend.< /Review></record>

<Review>Dr. Nassi is a terrific vet.  I had gone to the big corporate provider for years but every time I came it was a different doctor with no personal relationship.  From the beginning Dr. Nassi has taken a personal interest in my three dogs and I feel he has given them excellent professional service.  I can highly recommend Beverly Robertson</Review>< Pics>

After having my dog misdiagnosed several times ranging from Valley Fever to lung cancer, Dr. Nassi diagnosed him correctly with heart disease and barely in time to save his life.  It has been over 2 years and my dog is on a successful regimen of medication and prescription food.  He almost acts like when he was young again and every day is a blessing.  Thank you for giving us so many more days to share with him!</Text>

Can't say enough good things about Dr. Nassi and his team.  Our boxer rescue has poor social skills but frequent issues with her skin and ear infections.  We had been to several other vets in the area but had not gotten much besides temporary partial relief for her symptoms.  Dr. Nassi worked out a treatment plan with multiple approaches and consistency that made a huge difference in her (and our!) comfort and happiness.  After years of struggling with the same issues, I am amazed at how far she has come.  His team is always willing to work with you and discuss options in your budget, remembers who you are, what you need, what's been done, and special care that is needed.  Highly recommended for consistent, dedicated, compassionate care.  Thanks guys!</review>

The doc was able to see us right away, and get Degan in for testing and eventual surgery within the week. The doctor explained everything very well, and his prices (surgery included) were very reasonable.

They also explain procedures, processes, et cetera well. Dr. Nassi, Jennifer, CVT and all other staff from receptionist assistant are calm, professional and generally quite a welcome change from my last 2 vets!

Dr. Nassi and his staff truly care about the health and well being of your animals.  When our young kitty had an emergency, they saw him right away without an appointment.  Dr. Nassi made sure we understood exactly what treatments were necessary and helped us make reasonable decisions without pressure. Our kitty is happy and healthy now, in large part because of Beverly Robertson's excellent veterinary care. We are so glad we found a great vet!<//Review><Response>None< /Response><date>1486518803865< /date><Name>Jennifer Lynch<//Name>< rate>

<username>Tim T</username><review>There is not a better veterinary clinic than Dr. Nassi and his entire staff. After getting what seemed like a hopeless diagnosis for my puppy, Dr Nassi and every staff member went above and beyond the call of duty to save her. I could not have asked for better treatment. I now have a happy healthy ornery puppy. I cannot thank them enough. If you want a doctor and staff that treats your pet as if it were their own, this is the clinic for you.< /review></record>

<Text>Dr. Nassi is an excellent vet, it really doesn't get any better. Our dog has only seen Dr. Nassi and would you believe it, he loves going to the vet! The whole team are lovely to deal with and they truly care about your pet.

Just one of many examples of why I love this office:

At our previous vet, you would call with a question, speak to the operator and MAYBE hear back 4 hours later from someone at the front desk. With Dr. Nassi, you call with the question they put you on hold and you either get an immediate answer or get to speak to the Dr himself.

Thank you Dr. Nassi and the whole team!<//Text>< user_id>

<Text>Dr. Nassi and his team are wonderful!  We bring our dogs from the Porter Ranch area to see Dr. Nassi because he is so knowledgeable, caring and practical.  I cannot sing Dr. Nassi's praises enough... I trust him completely.  He has provided such amazing care to all of our dogs for years and, when the time came to say goodbye to a couple of our dogs, Dr. Nassi showed us tremendous compassion.  We feel so lucky to have found Dr. Nassi!!!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b9646c825871:0x392feed0b487f89e<//Gmap_id></record>

Dr Nassi has cared for my dogs and my daughters dogs for the years he was at Chatsworth Veterinary Clinic in Chatsworth in the the Valley. We were both devestated and pleased that he had opened his own clinic. But so far from where we both lived. Because of our trust in Dr Nassi, we both make the 1-1/2 hr drive each way to take our dogs to see him. I can't
express just how great this Dr is<//review>

I cannot more highly and genuinely, recommend a clinic better than Beverly Robertson.  Dr. Nassim and his incredible team and staff are unquestionably the best I have experience in more than 40 years in this area.  The facility is spotless, state of the art, and one feels assured from the moment you enter.  I became so disheartened by the big brand practices on the Westside and having to wait and be treated like I was doing them a favor to bring my animals in.  Always a hassle and I can honestly say, this is not the case here where my pets are treated with such kindness and compassion.  Dr. Nassim diagnosed by cat's serious illness on the first visit and I had been given the run-around by other clinics.  I knew we had landed at a clinic where he would be taken care of.  Trust your instinct's as they won't betray you and especially so when we assume responsibility for taking care of our pets.  I love this group and recommend to all my friends in Beverly Hills and all over SoCal.  Worth the time and distance and you best friend thanks you, too.<//Text>

<text>This is where I have been getting my truck washed for only $15 a month and it comes out pretty good I highly recommend it the best deal in town.

Reasonable price, quick and clean areas for wiping down your vehicle. I'd recommend you bring a towel for the exterior of the car and another for the interior. The attendant Chris, helped me out by wiping down the tires. He did a great job.<//Text>

<review>Great staff and are always ready to help. I was confused on the Type of Car wash I wanted, the Staff member allowed me to take 'Better' wash and then included that charge towards my Monthly fee. Cost effective & convenient. Decent results and they also give away Car Freshener/ Wipes every single time you visit.
Unlimited car washes include 1 wash/day.

They have ample spaces for People to park their cars and clean it thoroughly using Vacuums and Air jets.</review>< username>

<Review>The car is left with some soap and doesn't dry completely. Need to hand dry right after. The vacuums do not suction 100%, leaves alot behind.< /Review></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
Great place to get your car washed. Prices start at 6.00 and I believe go up to 14.00. I may be wrong. Anywho, the higher the prices the better your car is washed. Duh. I went and got the 6.00 car wash. While waiting for my car to be washed I noticed cars were coming out wet. I realized I would need something to dry it so I bought a microfiber towel. They're 2.00 and after you're done you can exchange it for a new one, pretty cool! After my car was washed, it was super wet so I gave it a quick dry. Regardless of it being wet, it was cleaned well. I was satisfied with the wash. I total I paid 8.00 for a good wash and a good vacuum. Will return, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the wet car.< /Review>

I prefer this drive through car wash to the others in the Fontana area. It gets my truck cleaner, I've noticed. I took off one star for the low powered vacuums. they could be stronger.</Review>

<review>Their machines do a pretty good job, and their vaccumes really suck! You might have to bring a rag or two to do some light drying. This was my first time going to this place but I'll be back again. For 10.00 bucks it's a pretty good deal. Check it out. 🚙🚗🚐...</review>< pictures>

It's a cool car wash no doubt I like how easy it is to be in and out but please beware if you have a dark colored car or a good forsaken BLACK car you will end up with swirls!!!. Or what a buddy of mine calls Spider webbing.< /text>

I highly recommend the monthly payment plan. It's $16.99 and you get unlimited car washes. Lines go pretty fast. My only complaint is they should open both lines, maybe they should have one line for paying customers and another line for monthly pass customers. Other than that, it's a good place to go and get your car washed. You should also take your own drying towels. They provide you with a wet wipe for your dashboard or an air freshener.<//Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>Price was okay and most of the wash but if you have a large crossover or even midsize be wary that their equipment might run your vehicle too hard as it did to my Mazda CX-9 on each side of my rear bumper. But I think other than that it's good place to wash and vacuum.</review>< resp>

<text>Staff was rude. They talked to me in Arabic and when I did not respond, they said a bad word in that language. My 17 years in Kuwait has helped me gain basic knowledge of spoken Arabic. The compressor was not working well, so, I couldn't vacuum the insides well...<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Zip line is the best. I love coming here because the staff is very nice and they make sure your car is clean and you are satisfied with your wash. My car always gets clean and the vacuum is free with your wash. I love that it is close to me and I don’t have to travel far. Thank you Zip line.</review>< Resp>

<review>Would give it 5 stars ... the staff is always cool and chill , I had an incident with my car , it was my fault  that car dried with spots the way it did and it was crazy busy when I went, I called just to ask what should I do to get the spots off and they kindly offered a free car wash which was super nice of them when I went back I encountered whom I assume was the manager on duty the guy was cool to me but very rude to his associates!. It's unprofessional to reprimand anyone in front of other employees and more importantly the paying customers!!! I saw the frustration on ALL of the employees faces.. bad enough that sometimes u get difficult customers but it sucks when u have to work with a difficult person.. I felt bad for them< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c34c7f09473ff3:0xf87f96779f8a55fc< /gmap_id></record>

Newly built new machines the only thing lacking which can be done without is that there is no shade. So using the vaccums during the heat.... Well you know what that feels like</Review>

After today I had to give a new review every Saturday and Sunday morning I get off of work at 6 a.m I come straight to zipline am I always park inside until they actually open none of the employees have ever given me problems about it until this morning I'm actually considering I'm finding a new car wash to go to and ending my membership here I've been here for a few months already I always felt welcomed until today so I had to waste my gas come back home sit in my parking lot wait until 7 I'm going to go back and cancel my membership and try a different car wash now< /Text>

Best deal is monthly pass. Pays for 2 washes. Over 2 is like a free wash and money you are saving. Great customer service.< /text>

The vacuums aren't the best, but the car wash gets the job done. You also get a good smelling car freshener when you get your car wash there, so that's a plus for me.< /Text>

Love this carwash! I drive all the way from Rancho to use it. I like that vacuum is included, and I can take my time (no rushing to beat the timer like i have to do with the vac at the gas station).  I hope they open one closer to the Rancho/Upland area.</review>

It takes 30 minutes waiting to be found in the system every visit because I'm not registered correctly.   The owner doesn't care about his location.  He also needed to replace management a few times in a short period because of his attitude and incompetence.  Please find another place to wash your car.</text>
