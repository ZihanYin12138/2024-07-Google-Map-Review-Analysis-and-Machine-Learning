<pictures>None</pictures><Review>Joe and his staff run an honest, high-quality, and fairly-priced business. He'll give you options to work with based on how much you want to invest or how much you can afford, which was incredibly valuable to me during the financial hardship of the pandemic. He's honest about what they can and can't do, will never try to upsell or use manipulative sales techniques to skimp on work and maximize profits. He does the job right at a reasonable price, and will always work with you to provide whatever he can within your budget.

We had a major engine issue in a car that was (rarely used, so a slow oil leak went unnoticed until it was too late) and ended up having to get the whole engine block replaced, and he quoted me a $1000 less than any of his competitors, which I quoted with 10 different shops prior to getting the recommendation to go to him. He did the work as quickly as possible and even threw in a towing job for free because he knew it was a major expense and any money I could save was a huge help at the time. It was finished within just a few days, and has been working fantastic ever since. A few months later I had to go back to get some other minor work, and then again recently for some issues from a hit-and-run while I was parked on the street, and he helped both times, with the same excellent experience, reasonable rates, and high quality service I'd come to expect.

Great people running an excellent shop that gives "small town" service and quality in the middle of the city. I would recommend his shop to anyone doing any kind of standard repair work, and I won't go anywhere else.< /Review>< rating>

Got a nail in my tire, Pep Boys (where I bought the tires) told me it wasn't covered under the warranty and I'd have to drop the car off for something like 7 hours. For a tire plug. Called Joe's Auto Center because they're near my house; they had me in and out in about 15 minutes, no charge. Clean-looking shop, everyone I talked to was super nice.<//review>

< Review>
For 3 years my 2009 Ford Escape has made a rattling noise in the engine. I’ve been to 6 different auto shops and have been told it’s the belt and they could change it for $1500, it’s the radiator ($1,000), nothings wrong with it, etc. etc. Nothing against my car but I wasn’t going to put $1,200 into a 12 year old car..

I took it to Joe, without an appointment to have my oil changed and mentioned it in passing as I was leaving. I was called 40 minutes later telling me it was the timing belt and he could replace it for $315 and change all my fluids. It was also done by 9 am the next day.

I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER with the service we received. My husband and I have not heard my car this quiet in years, we joked that we took the wrong car home. So thankful to have found Joe’s auto shop. We will be loyal customers as long as we live in southern ca.< /Review>

<Text>I researched a Honda mechanic in Long Beach and found Joe's Auto Center. His business had good reviews so I sent my Mother there to repair her car. She had a damaged oil pan that needed repair. She called me at home (Mexico) and told me that they did an excellent job at a great price. She said that they were VERY POLITE,, did'nt pressure her,, were very honest,, and since she lived close by, they picked her up. She's very excited to have a new 'regular' mechanic for her car (2002 Honda Civic). They service all types of vehicles. Thanks Joe (and Family/employees) for taking GOOD care of my Mom!!! Very much appreciated!!!< /Text><GmapID>0x80dd33eec0b12589:0xa24e3ad05dfca27d</GmapID><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

the BEST auto center you will find in all of SoCal. Joe's Auto Center is a labor of love by Vera and Joe's family. They are honest, kind, and genuine people. My husband and I have been taking our cars there for 10 years now and we wont stop even though we now live a few hours away.<//Text>

I, and many others, have been going to Joe's Auto for years.  I read about Joe's so long ago and I know why it gets so many stars.  You are treated right, priced fairly and he and his staff always do what they say they will do.  That is a precious attribute these days!<//review>

This is the best auto repair shop I've experienced in Long Beach. I trust everything they tell me and their prices are reasonable. I brought a Toyota Matrix to the dealer for a recall, and got an 8 page listing of all the problems i should fix asap for about $2500. Laughed, brought my car to Joe's, rhey looked at the report, chucked it, and did the work i actually needed (in reality a lot less) for $850.

Go their a few times and they know you, very friendly< /text>

They checked it out and called within a couple of hours to let me know what was going on, and told me that they’d have it fixed that day (meaning they’d even stay a little past closing to get it all finished). They were very nice and seemed very reasonably priced. I would definitely go back and highly recommend to anyone!< /Text>< Pictures>

Trustworthy mechanic. When you drop off your car and get it back, you know the job is done. Awesome and nice people. It's the cleanest shop that you will ever see. I mentioned that to Joe and he said that he prides himself on that. Clean and efficient.</review>

I don't know enough about cars to rate a mechanic based on skill or price. I judge mechanics on whether they do what they say they will, whether the deliver service promptly, and how upfront they are with me. Joe and his family score five stars across the board.

Over the years, Joe has offered to bill me a month later to help with a big $$$ repair. He has loaned me a car computer thingy for a weekend to help pass a smog test. And most importantly he listens when I tell him I don't want to fix every little thing... But to just keep my old car running.

I plan to keep returning to Joe's.< /review><date>1539295817169<//date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I have been taking my cars to Joe's Auto Center for many years! The quality, work ethic, and expertise that Joe and all his mechanics employ is outstanding.  Joe is NEVER satisfied unless the work meets his high expectations. This is an OUTSTANDING business.  I would highly recommend Joe's Auto Center!< /Review>< Pictures>

I was a mechanic years ago, I know what to look for, and this shop is AWESOME. They genuinely care for taking care of people. I am really impressed by their professionalism and genuine care for their clients and work they do. Highly Recommended!!!!!< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>when is comes to mechanic shops it's like getting a hair cut . you go in knowing what you what and how you want it done and then come out looking like crap because they do what THEY want. Joe's auto center is the total opposite! this place is really great . the owner is awesome and very honest. Firestone wanted to charge me double for the price of the parts. when I went to Joe's and he told me the real price, I was so upset at firestone and their dishonesty. you can tell Joe cares about his customers and their needs. he's a very hard working man that knows how to get things done and the right way. I 100% recommend this shop. thanks Joe :)</review>< Pictures>

Finally a mechanic I can trust! They're a very honest and straight to the point family business. They tell you exactly what's wrong with your car and they even gave me a discount!!< /Review>

Joe's auto is reliable, quick, thorough, but most important, reasonably priced.  We've been taking our cars here for a few years now, and there is no place better.< /review>

<Review>two days ago was our first time we came to that fine restaurant. But It is no doubt not the last. We passed a splendid evening with the generous service, with the first-rate  dishes and fine drinks and with the decent charge. We will definitely visit there again.</Review><gmapID>0x80c2ce29ce891677:0x3a106b80fe176a53</gmapID>< date>

<Review>Good taste,  cheap eats. The AC needs to be turned up, but as far as the grub, its pretty good. A bit of clutter from cases of soda, water but its Clean.
I recommend to try it if you're in Montebello.< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Good value overall. Couple small caveats. The potatoes in the chicken curry were excessively soft and become mashed just trying to fork one. Excellent wonton soup. 10 cents for fortune cookies. Fountain pop is expensive as they charge for refills. I'd rate the buffet food 3-4 starts (this v includes the chicken curry) , but observing other people's plates, and my  wonton soup, the made to order items are easily 5 stars, for a good price.</Text>< Pictures>

Food is okay. Fair price. The only gripe I have is when I ordered the 3 item combo to go. The put all the items in the same single box. All the sauces got mixed up and was not tasty anymore.</Review>

MetaTouch is my go to place whenever I have any issues!  I've run marathons, I am a mother, run a business, and wearing high heels have not helped my body stay in balance. Holden puts me right back into alignment and I find myself standing up straighter, taller and feeling lighter when I leave.  I've been seeing him for years and no matter what issues you are having he will talk them through with you, work with you and help you through it!  I am constantly impressed with him and his staff every single time I go and recommend his services highly!<//text>

A gifted healer. Just by looking at you, Holden can tell what's out of balance and he knows exactly how to fix it. I have scoliosis and left shoulder trauma from a car accident. I'm also a triathlete. Holden customized my treatment to target exactly what I needed to continue to train and to just feel good. He also has the best bedside manner; relaxed, chill, and a genuine want for you to be pain-free. I could not possibly recommend Holden/MetaTouch Body Balance any higher.< /Text>

<text>Incredible work performed by Holden. I never really have suffered an injury before, and I had knee pain that popped out of no where. Desperately wanting to get back to my intensive exercising , Holden had me exercising again in 3 days. He taught me more about my body than any doctor specializing in podiatry or scolioses I grew up seeing. Thank you so much for everything! Fantastic experience:)<//text></record></dataset><record>

He manipulates your muscles, tendons and bones back to where they are supposed to be. I swear I am an inch taller when he is done with me.

I just saw Holden for much needed alignment. The session went great -- I was seated on time, Holden was very informative and explained the reasoning behind his techniques and the best part is I feel much much better now. It's very clear that exercise alone is not enough to stay healthy and and these sessions are a great starting point. Five Stars for sure.</Review>

Holden is a miracle worker! I’m so grateful for his healing skills and understanding of the mind and body connection. Yesterday I came to his office with sever neck pain. He gracefully treated my neck and then got to the root of my pain with a full body Energy Healing session! It was extraordinary - just like Gwyneth Paltrow’s recent Goop Lab episode on Energy Healing. I have to say I was a true skeptic of the type of treatment and nothing but a BIG believer now! The healing was instant and I still feel light as a feather today, Thank You Holden!</review>

Holden is the best, I mean the greatest massage therapist ever.  He's so amazing that each time I go for an appointment, I can't wait until I go
again.  Holden is so thorough, you really feel so relaxed & fully renewed.
It's a family affair with Holden, my family all feel the same about Holden
that is a total therapeutic experience !

I recommend Holden very highly for your personalized and individual treatment, so don't wait to schedule your appointment.</review>

I have used the services of Meta Touch for a few years now, and have always been satisfied by their expertise, their professionalism and their cordial, friendly attitude. Kathy, who has taken care of me  has always left me revived and relaxed after each session. I would recommend Meta Touch  very highly without hesitation or reservations.< /Review>

MetaTouch is exactly as my friend who recommended it to me described. It's a no-frills kind of place that is meant to dig in and fix you up. Quite possibly one of the most effective massages that I have had. My therapist got to the problem and worked it out very well.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I started treatment at MetaTouch about a year and a half ago, following a  motorcycle accident which resulted in a fractured L2. I had heard Holden called a "true healer" many times before but only until I was on the table did I understand the truth behind that sentiment.
Holden worked with me for months providing therapeutic massage and significantly impacting my ability to heal. Over the course of several weeks and months we were able to generate blood flow and relieve much of the tension and stiffness that was held in my middle-lower back.
Later, I began acupuncture with Norma. Norma's skill and ability are unparalleled. Acupuncture was intimidating to me at first but with Norma's personable, personalized and educational approach, I felt very comfortable. She is experienced, knowledgeable, and an all around wonderful human.
I recommend MetaTouch to anyone looking for a trustworthy wellness center. Whether recovering from a significant injury or simply looking for some skilled hands to alleviate your stress MetaTouch will take very good care of you, as they continue to do for me.<//Text>< pictures>

I went to MetaTouch for a couple different issues.  Holden did his assessment on me and then got to work.  When I picture a massage that is to get kinks out and help with specific issues, I picture it not being very comfortable and maybe a bit painful.  With Holden, none of the process was painful and it was super effective! It was amazing and it's great to be in proper alignment with my body!!!  Thank you MetaTouch.< /Text>

<text>Cathy was AWESOME!, she definitely has the magic touch. I really like the Zen set up that Meta Touch offers in their individual rooms, with dim lights, soft music, and aroma therapy to set you right to relax, what an Awesome experience, I most definitely recommend Meta Touch to All.

Thanks again Cathy!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< username>

I have been going to Metatouch for a number of years. The message therapists are the best in the city- they understand body mechanics and work with you to proactively address problems. Todd is my all time favorite- He has magical hands!<//Text>

My wife & I have been seeing Holden since September 2007 when I needed physical therapy due to training with Capoeira.
And now as somewhat "Seasoned Citizens" experiencing the normal challenges of getting more mature he has been a God sent blessing to us!
The staff at MetaTouch is courteous, caring and professional.
You won't be disappointed with Holden Zalma & MetaTouch.</Text>

<Text>After two pregnancies and breast feeding for about 3 years my body was in need of some TLC. Holden was very warm and personable and made what can be an awkward situation (being half naked under a little sheet) a comfortable and relaxing experience.  I had sprained my back several months earlier and was unsure if I even needed to be "fixed" (as it had more or less healed) but I had some tension in my neck and shoulders and still would feel tingling in my back on occasions. My husband has known Holden for many years now and would always return from his visits with him as if he had seen a miracle worker! I finally decided it was my turn for a change.  Holden gave me a short assessment and pointed out that not only was my neck locked up but my left hip was locked and three ribs were out of place.  Oh the joys of having children! I left MetaTouch feeling loose, relaxed and refreshed.  I would definitely recommend anyone to pay them a visit!<//Text></record>

After having a bad experience dealing with the customer service line and feeling like I was getting ripped off, I decided to go into an office to make changes to my policy. I highly recommend asking for Daniel. He was very helpful and knowledgeable, and made the changes quickly without any issues.< /Review>

You know at the time that I called these people they were very nice and they seemed helpful at the time period the girl that I spoke to was very good at her customer service I have no ill will toward her but undisclosed fees and promising a certain amount that I was going to have to pay when it was a complete lie and then putting my count overdrawn without my consent to do automatic payments was absolutely appalling. I will finish out this month with this company and then I will make a point of not dealing with them again they can't be trusted there is better way to do business than this.<//review>

<review>This is Armando and I switched from Allstate to Freeway seeking a better and lower price and I found just that! Francine was very helpful in finding a low priced plan that worked for me and my family. She was knowledgeable, easy to approach, and a kind agent! I would definitely recommend this insurance agency, especially Francine to our friends, family, and anyone looking for great service and a lower price in car insurance. Thank you for all your help!<//review>< pictures>

Horrible service, they dont care about the customer. The worst experience, I am business man and I understand you have to make your money but this was outrageous! The agent was not friendly or  knowledgeable. DONT COME HERE!< /Review>

This place is awesome. If you go there, ask for Daniel. He was kind and straight foward. I needed to renew my yearly insurance and he saved me about $200 compared to last year. I really appreciated the time and the dedication he took to find me a cheaper quote. And he had such a great sense of humor!</review>

<Text>I made a call to see about adding another vehicle to my policy, but I did not have the vehicle information with me. I made an appointment for the following day, however my day got busy and I was not able to get in. The girls in the office were great with the reminder calls to see if I wanted to get the quote over the phone, however I still did not have the info with me when they called. Finally Saturday came around, I was off work and had my paperwork with me. I ran down to the H street location, to see if it was still open. IT was, and Maricruz was there finishing up with a client. I was lucky that I got there with half hour to go before closing.  The time did not bother her, and she took every measure to take care of my insurance needs. I felt so bad to keep her late, pass closing hour, and offered to come back in Monday. Maricruz said you are here now, let's see what the best policy is for you. Her professionalism, and her kindness went above all standards, not once did she have a bad attitude or made rude comments. Needless to say, I felt I got the best rate for my vehicle needs and I will be referring friends and family to her. THANK YOU Maricruz for staying to the end with me. You were truly a lifesaver that evening.</Text>< Pics>

I works with Yosenya (spelling) 2/22/2018. She was amazing! She made the process of getting insurance quick easy and painless. I really enjoyed her personality and how efficient she was at her job. If you're looking to get insurance talk to you her and she'll hook you up.< /text>

<review>I went to the freeway insurance on H street. They greeted me right away and offered us water. Azucena and Daniel were very friendly, helpful and explained how I could lower my payment. While they processed everything Azucena gave my daughter paper to draw and Daniel step by step explained everything to my husband because he speaks spanish so he did his best.<//review>< Pictures>

Don't give  this company your info they will charge you whether u want their service  or not.  They still haven't sent my refund for a payment that was never authorized.  This company still hasn't fixed  it.  Horrible service.  They smile at you with a smerk  instead of fixing the issue and acknowledging the fact that they commit fraud.  Do not go here.</text>

They fit me in first thing in the morning, hooked me up with a full used tire, and I was back on the road by 8AM. Great people and reasonable price for everything.

I'm glad that there are business owners who respect the military enough to be so generous.  I highly recommend this business!< /Text>< Response>

<Date>1618860610626</Date><review>Scott is the best and has experienced multiple tacomas on wheel alignments on after market lifts and He definitely knows what he's talking about. I drive a 3rd gen tacoma 2017 trd off road on bilstein 5100s with old man emu springs and an add a leaf springs in the rear, with spc upper control arms adjustable. I called around other shops and were being told they could do it but I was skeptical of them and when I called McCoy and what Scott told me, based on his answer was a given that he was THE guy to go to. He did not try to do anything but told me the truth about it. To ANY Tacoma owners, definitely hit up Scott at McCoy tires in 9th street. My alignment came out perfect. I wish I  have brought my truck in sooner before. I'm definitely going to be bringing them my business. This is Vang by the way. Thank you so much!</review><GmapID>0x809053ec7029327b:0xd497ff128ce308e0</GmapID><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><userid>114615611578913629270</userid><username>Riki Maru</username>< Rate>

Amazing work! I got a flat and unfortunately the hole was on the side of my tire so I had to get it replaced. I brought my car here and they had me in and out within 15 minutes! Super nice people and the price was lower than I expected. Thank you guys! Hopefully I don’t hit another curb...but if I do, I’ll be back.</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I am from Montreal, Canada, and I was stuck in California for days because of an issue woth my car. Went to 3 different shops that quoted rear brakes and rotors for $1300. Yes, you read that right.
After reading some reviews, I decided to call for an estimate and they gave me a very reasonable price.

Shawn is the mechanic that worked on my car. He first told me to expect a couple of hours, but finally could do it in approx. And even saved me more money because he could just surface the rotors instead of replacing them  like all other shops said they HAD to do.

Had an amazing experience. I highly recommend. Thank youuuu.<//text>< Pics>

There is one thing that keeps me coming back here. Of course they do fantastic work and they do it fast. But it's how they treat you that it's unparalleled.  Super nice and not in that fake, "salesy" sort of way.< /Review>

First time I brought my truck and the guys here are awesome! Steven instantly greeted me at the entrance. My truck needed the tires rotated and I had a nail in one of them causing air leakage and they fixed it on the house per Randy and the tire rotation was free!!!!!  Two thumbs up to Shawn and Adan for fixing my tires and making it safer for me to visit my family for the holidays in LA.I'm definitely coming back and making this shop my go to place.</Review>

The person who helped me was Scott, and he didn't try to sell me something that I didn't need and gave me great information about my cars. OH YEAH, it was all FREE!!! Great service, knowledgeable people, definitely recommend them!!<//Text>< response>

I called from Turlock if they had my tire in stock at 1:30pm, they did. I drove up there, talked to friendly people at the counter, and I left at 2:15 with fresh tires on my car at a cheaper price than Costco with almost no wait! Highly recommend. Wish I could give 6 stars.< /Review>

1. Blame the roads in Ca.
2. Blame the previous mechanic that handled the car
3. Explain to me that it must be the caster, which they did not adjust since it is not adjustable (on my vehicle) at the means and equipment they have . They say that they can not handle a heavy vehicle like mine.

If this is the case why did they inform me from the start that part of the alignment will not be done and why do they chrage full price for half or 2/3 of a job that did not solve my problem .< /text></record></dataset><record>

While driving north on 99 my tire sensor said that I had low air pressure. I drove to the nearest tire shop and was greated by a friendly and polite staff. The service was fast and thorough. The tire tech found a huge screw in my rear tire, he got my tire fixed and me back on the road. With the help of McCoy Passenger Tire that bump in the road turned into nothing more than a hiccup during my commute to SFO and i didn't miss my flight.<//Review>

<text>8/22/18 I took my 2002 yukon for an alignment and new cams. "Scott" the partial owner took my work order and started on my truck. I left the truck overnight so they had plenty of time to perform the alignment and repairs. I advised them that I was moving to texas friday wich is today and needed the truck highway and travel ready. I picked my truck up thursday the 23rd the (next day) I paid and drove off as I figured all was good. I first noticed the alignment was a little better but not much, but I didn't have time to go back I needed to start packing for the move. So I get about a quarter mile from home and I hear this awful sound coming from my rear tire so I poll over and open the caps to my rims figuring maybe there was dirt in there making noise. Come to find out none of my lug nutts were tighened or torked!!! The noise was a lug nut spinning on my hub. So before you leave this place make suuurre you check all lug nutts and work performed or go elsewhere!!!! Horrible service!!!</text>< pictures>

<Review>Love coming here to get my WIC. The ladies are so good to the families and I. Love them way better than San Pablo because they rude over there. Today I was disappointed because I thought they closed at 7pm.. doors were locked up at 620pm. Better communication online please<//Review>< Pictures>

It’s ok... Also the facility or building is old and ugly.Makes me think of rodents and roaches. Could improve customer service some cashiers are rude. Also the selection of groceries is not very  good there’s should be more variety.< /review>

This place is awesome for some one who has WIC cheque. They handle each cheque by themself. They will grab each item and help to load to your car. Really wonderful service. Felt like i am a boss.
Try it guys.< /review>

(Translated by Google) It is a good place only for the staff to seem to not like working there and they would have to be forced, but one that is called smooth, apparently the problems of the house take them to work and take it out on people who go for food would have to do staff evaluation to see how skilled they are to serve customers

(Original)
Es un buen lugar  solo que el personal parese que no le gusta trabajar ai y los tubieran obligados mas una que se llama lisa al parecer los problemas de la casa los lleva al trabajo y se desquita con las personas que bamos por alimentos tendrian que hacer una evaluación de su personal para ver que tan capasitadas estan para atender alos clientes<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service !!! All the workers are very rude and always in a bad mood they speak badly and answer badly if we have questions .... a new chubby I imagine I scream if I did not sign the coupons as it was in the trajeton they did not accept the coupon when I brought my baby in arms had never had that problem .. in order should have a training on how to help the consumer

Muy mal servicio!!! Todas las trabajadoras muy groseras y siempre están de mal humor nos hablan mal y contestan mal si tenemos preguntas.... una gordita nueva me imagino me grito si no firmaba los cupones como estaba en el trajeton no me aceptaban el cupón cuando yo traía  mi bebé en brazos nunca había tenido ese problema.. en fin deberían tener un entrenamiento de cómo ayudar al consumidor<//Text>

<text>Ship: Royal Princess. Traditional style of cruising. Service was as expected but we did find the staff to be a bit unenthusiastic. Would have liked a few more smiles and nice words.

Food was great and better than other cruise ships. For casual dining we especially liked the pizza place next to the pools on deck 16. Fresh delicious pizza slices all day!

Our favorite was the movies under the stars. Modern movies on the big screen, complete with popcorn and drinks! Super fun.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXmDSG63jaZ84VJhhTeIy5Sq6YBq1kUMtO_Rs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url':

I wish I could give zero stars. Princess canceled our cruise last minute, effectively ruining our anniversary and long overdue honeymoon. We're out hundreds of dollars on childcare summer camp we paid so my husband and I could take this trip. They offered us 10% incentive, which is insulting and a slap in the face. I'd add a picture but since I didn't get to go, I have nothing to post. I'm thoroughly disgusted with their business practices< /review>

<Name>PP Modame's< /Name><time>1543950364639</time><rate>1< /rate><text>Customer service representative is rude and ignorant. Free phone toll number cannot reach, so have to call office number. Once explained problems details then the first representative forwarded to another department and as repeated story for another time and too many times then no response and the line was cut off by them. No response and resolution until I contacted my credit card company and issues were solved and they called back apologized. A few conversations on phone is continued by racist attitude and ignorant senior staff who was on the other line. The word like yellow was used ‘Asian way of course’,.! I totally sick of your recruitment way and choice of selection.
Had good time cruised but this has nothing to do with the management and customer relations and after sales service .!

Same as on board, staff and crew outside the customer relations desk is very friendly nice& helpful, staff at the buffet, swimming pool area, other departments, etc; is attentive and worth my gratitude. But at customer relations desk, staff only talk to your credit card, not you. They don’t even say thank you, yelled at customers, people lined up to pay but the passengers looked very angry and some seemed depressed unlike when they were in other areas. Well, strangely experienced the same impression at the lotto desk on the cruise. Pathetic people behind desk really. 🤮Why don’t you have online option onboard so you don’t have to hire these idiot people behind help desk?, as they aren’t not helpful at all.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMWQysT9-OBDTlCSzS2OfFKpDf3U07YeccRXVX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwJFwjBmey41KZWwSPbchg6KqBtlSEvsGbLsOW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc81UUw09RDQbpC9klZX6yXCGSvQNlIzgydI43=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN06CNczUl3OEYRWx5HYY3IGeqsL45u6wt2JPri=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMh18impsSKqI-5UY6hPrRgS_kNxhqp9boRrPcc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhWQkSmV6P4QauAwYj6qO2eZRxpSyuav0ss5h7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP00Nn1J87Vfc4F5itsu1hVTHbKHbfA2mZlx51n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

Sailed 10 days over Xmas 2019 from San Francisco to Mexico and back on the Grand Princess. Overall, great cruise! Hard working helpful personable staff, great food, good to excellent entertainment and excellent movie selections in our cabin and great shore excursions. I'll be onboard again.< /review>

During this covid crisis you expect agents to behave honestly and we expect them to live up to  their reputation. Our cruise is on the 19th June 2021, they know full well that it’s not going to travel but they want you to pay for the cruise and take months to return your money like in 2020. They further want to charge cancelation fees and hold on to your deposit...do the right thing and refund us our money, this is a force majeure and this poor customer service will deter us from using Planet Cruise or Iglu Cruise again. Customers vote with their feet and many have covered to to use this company.. sadly I won’t recommend them to anyone, shameful behaviour</Text>

<text>Absolutely fantastic!!!

We had a fantastic cruise with this cruise line on the Sea Princess. Our cabin was great with a super comfy mattress; the dining rooms and specialty restaurants, cafes and bars were amazing; the quality and range of food was just as amazing (oh those desserts, especially those sinfully delicious Chocolate Journeys) and the entertainment was first class.  The magnificent atrium and shopping boutiques and salons were fun on those sea days.  Lots of fun activities including workshops and karaoke nights, and the table tennis, pool, spa and fitness center were all excellent.  The shore excursions were great and so well organised and to top it all off, the hardworking staff were all super friendly, always polite and helpful. It was an all round super amazing experience! There were a few minor irritations:

* speed of the onboard internet was sometimes a bit slow;
* some of the movies (e.g. Edward Scissorhands) were a bit old and pitched at the wrong passenger demographic;
* the photo staff were sometimes a little too much in your face.

However, our experience with Princess Cruises was overwhelmingly positive, hence the 5-stars and highly recommend.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c28750a5fc75a3:0xec627bb6f2e0baad< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

A short 4-day cruise from Long Beach, CA to Catalina Island and then on to Ensenada, Mexico.  We had great weather the whole time which probably made it a more smooth ride.  Food was good to great, depending on what it was.  I highly suggest trying the Crown Grill and Share by Curtis Stone.  Staff was great, everyone was friendly and helpful.  Lots of stuff to do.  Never got bored.  We will cruise with Princess again.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhY0LT9Yk3-LUHm-xKE4rmOFRlXmDcNlbiqWj_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLQtQc2ih9P24EqrDhj3vqqBkZCxmpIKEarcBa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9cfUdFYxJoYP_u-4q8dGhn2SNOI4yWLSn-zln=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmUZ2SgpL4C2GJ8J_JzoUx7Bjnk5q_Ewq-_EYU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0CdpgW6oduVhsi1DxAJi9w_CZ4iZ5JrUvK2_L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhaIyok122jzUCHBW1k4I52WkdVwiT6lVn6Wnq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_YMI5otP3d5dXMDA8iRH_Yjqt1-g3K5Hgnl8Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFMeKk-o4MZKEl0zFn6RhrG43rj4twTOc3o-8t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIyCjsQqKga2WG-AhjGL2pd0CAj_pV_1xExS9S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqARmLqhGFj7VjqGpDI-nbV2zFMgNAr78qepxe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkulNHU8CUzFUjA4VzacGk5sXoconoVMh0SRy9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmNRhLdNxIkl2wXDh5g1fYyj6n1-PLqIp5TICK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVae06TiKPAGLdaMNitMOyJ0osdBu1BtY4EUqJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c28750a5fc75a3:0xec627bb6f2e0baad<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Do not be ok with Princess!  We booked a cruise for our family with a total of 6 balcony cabins and a suite for May 2020.   We paid our cruise fare in full by February as required.  Then Covid hit and our cruise was cancelled.  We were offered a refund and chose that option as my husband and sister in law are over 70 and travel is never certain.  Our cruise was paid for with American Express Rewards Cards.  In March when the cruise was cancelled we explained that the cards had an April expiration date. We told them over and over that the cards would be invalid and money lost if after that date.  Princess put us off and refunded the money to American Express on May 28, 2020. We have been following up and contacting Princess, American Express and the people that gave us the cards to no avail.  Today, 8 months later Princess Customer Relations Agent Karen Jean said our $3910. is not their problem and the issue is done.  She refused to give us a contact if someone else in the organization to talk with that can help.  We’re just out our nearly $4,000. and too bad.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

We had a great time on our four day cruise to Mexico. The staff was awesome. We had a little health emergency incident with my 3 year old son he had an allergic reaction we rushed him down to the medical care they were amazing the nurse took care of us immediately and was very kind and calming we were terrified out of our minds, we had ran across the entire ship with our son wrapped in a blanket to the medical care. The Dr. Was phenomenal and even though our travel insurance covered it they did not charge that much it was a whole lot more affordable than going to the ER. Overall great cruise.< /text>

<Review>Princess Cruise Customer Service staff provided wrong information in a very pleasant manner that resulted me and my family were kicked off the ship 4 days early. My 88 years old father’s dream destination were missed. The unexpected last minute booking for flights, hotels, extra expenses and totally ruined our trip and put great risk on my father’s health.

A high ranking manager on the ship told us that he was going to send an email to Customer Service Department to investigate and educate the staff who gave wrong info. He told us to contact Princess Cruise Customer Relation to get respond.

Customer Relation responded to me 2 weeks after I was asked to send email with writing complain. The respond was: They never received emails from the manager on ship, no voice recording was reviewed for the false info provided by their Costumer Service. And “I am sorry, but there is nothing we can do.”

Last is not the least: My sister was bitten by an insect the second day on ship. One hive on her arm developed  to rashes on her both arms, legs and chest. I took her to the urgent care yesterday. It was diagnosed Scabies!

What else do I need to say?</Review>< userid>

I have already paid 40,000/- indian rupees in
Mr.John's account.
He said to me you pay only 40,000/- one time for everything. And He is saying 70,000/- pay again.
Mr.John is cheating now.
Mr.John please refund my money or make my working visa.<//Review>

when you book the fare today,  if they drop the price within 48 hours and you call back to ask the courtesy credit.  they won't credit you back with the different. the different isn't 1 or 2 dollars. it's $200 different. so you won't be satisfy for the price when you do the booking

<text>Excellent Customer Service! I recently had an issue logging-in to the boarding app (due to a conflict in the spelling of my name) and they were very accommodating. When the representative was unable to resolve the problem herself, she didn't transfer me to someone else so I could explain the situation all over again. She politely placed me on hold, made a couple of calls, resolved the problem, and then came back and ensured I was able to login! This is the way it should go down.... easy resolution with minimal impact on the customer! Great job, Princess! A+++<//text>< UserId.>

I would never recommend Princess Cruise Lines.  They are a horrible savage company.  I went on a sailing over 13 months ago and Princess Cruises has submitted a request by a collections agency to collect more monies from me even though everything was settled at the time of sailing.  I have spoken to over 23 representatives who stated everything has been settled; apparently not, according to the collections agency.  In my opinion, all representatives I spoke with seem to be completely incompetent and lack any form of professionalism.  They barely speak English.  I will never sail with them again and would highly recommend ANYONE from sailing with this scam artist Cruise Line.  They are the bottom of the barrel scum bags!<//Text>

We had to cancel a Princess cruise for our parents 30-days out after dad ran into serious medical problems. Dad eventually passed after a long struggle. Both of my parents were Platinum Elite members with Princess. Throughout our ordeal, we requested for some kind of credit for mom to use on a future cruise. Unfortunately, Princess was adamant that we should have paid extra for cancellation insurance and we would have to forfeit 100% of our cruise and air fees including the balcony upgrades. Princess customer service ignored our requests to elevate to higher management. We attempted to call Princess customer service and could not get through the long wait times.</Text>

I took a 10 days cruise on Grand Princes and it was terrible.  I called this morning to speak to their costumer service, they indicated I would have to put my complaints in writing.  so I will put my review on social media.  Old ship, while walking on deck 7 their employees smoke in the pass of the walk I inhaled  cigarette smoke daily.  If you order breakfast to be delivered at 7:00 AM they deliver it at 6:30 because they are to busy.  Internet slow and if you complaint, they just ignore you.  I would never use them again.</Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Warning to everyone: do NOT buy any photos from the Platinum Studio on Princess Cruises. One photo ($450 usd just for that one photo) never delivered to us. The others were delivered but the quality was poor and did not look like the photo previews they had shown us in person and gave us print-outs of. We contacted Princess and Platinum Studio and they completely ignored us. After a second follow-up, they gave us a generic reply saying they will get back to us- after almost 2 months, no reply at all! Our missing photo was still never delivered to us! Definitely not the kind of service you would expect from a $1,800 usd order on premium quality photos!

STAY AWAY from Princess Platinum Studio! To be honest, I think I will reconsider even going on another Princess Cruise. My family are at Platinum level with Princess, but we are seriously going to reconsider after this awful experience. Their customer service seems to be quite awful in general (irresponsible and unprofessional) - we found bug-like thingy in our cabin just this past trip and the way they dealt with it was totally unacceptable (and there were balls of dust lying on the cabin floor - will try to update this with photos if I can find them)

So yes, in summary - totally avoid princess platinum studio (don’t even go for that free shooting - you will feel pressured to purchase like we did! The photos are beautiful but in hindsight not worth all the $$. Customer service is next to none if your order arrived incomplete) and just reconsider Princess Cruises in general (their rooms are dirty and customer service is bad)

Hope this helps others avoid the mistakes we made!<//text>< pics>

<Review>Second cruise with you guys. We had a mini suite (C417 Gregory Hall) on the Regal just disembarked today from a 7 night Caribbean. Wonderful and beautiful ship. We found the staff to be rushed and short staffed in certain areas. Lack of sun-loungers in the retreat. Really quite obnoxious staff at horizon court (Milan staff name) Obviously Irwin our room attendant was 5stars as he has to work 247...... We wont travel on the Regal again maybe Enchanted or Sky with a suite. After spending  8k £££ on business class BA flights 2x stays at the Ritz Carlton FLL and the upgrade to a suite, celebrity and MSC are offering a better deal to be honest for customers like us from the UK. Looking forward to a direct response from Jan Swartz..... (you have my email) Last grumble- why do you need to have the stingray area at PCays???? Is it really needed in this earth friendly world????<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c28750a5fc75a3:0xec627bb6f2e0baad</gmap_id></record>

< review>
I went cruise trip with Princess’s Alaska cruise on last July with 9 elderly adults including my parents, aunt and uncle and I totaly disappointed on their customer service. Actually all the cruise experience including dining, room, service of ship crew and all the amazing events on board were much better than I expected and I really enjoyed lots of entertainments. But my disappointment came at the last. A night before last disembarking day, we had to take our big luggages for smooth disembarkation process at the last day (the ship crew will bring them into luggage storage and people can claim their luggage at the port). So do we took them out of our room. But when we were out of the shop and tried to find our luggages, there werent one of our luggage there. I asked the cruise staff to help us find it but she kept told us to go and ask port staff to help about that. Port staff said that there is nothing they can do other than just waiting for the luggage (that might taken by someone) to come back. Is that make sense? Isn’t there any security camera to look for that at that big port? OR before that, why the cruise staff just put bunch of luggages all over separately at the port even though there is a specific area tag for each luggages? We had 16 luggages to find but there was only 11 at the right area to find. I don’t get how they work every cruise trip. Is this happened only for me? I don’t think so. Even I made a two separete report to Princess Cruise about missing luggages, they just sent me the respond that they will try to look for that and until now no other contacts than that which is already 10 days passed. I don’t say this if we lost our luggages by our own fault, but the missing happened when they handled the luggage and not responsible about that. It was my aunt’s luggage and there were her medicine to take daily for next two months. She ruined all her trip (so do I and my whole family) to New York which was right after the cruise trip. I hope there will be no more victim like us and tried to bring the luggage by your own if you can.<//review>

Princess owes us $6,392.90 + port fees. According to the corporate office, this is not refundable. Apparently, they do not honor verbal communication where the Sapphire Princess said we would get our money refunded BEFORE we decided to disembark. Our original flights were scheduled to depart 17 December 2017 on Qatar Airways from Atlanta, Georgia. On 17 December, the Atlanta airport had a power outage, thus cancelling our flight to Doha. We immediately contacted Princess and EZ Air. No one could help schedule a new flight on 17 December. Qatar Airways was also closed. On 18 December, we contacted Princess, EZ Air, and Qatar Airways several times trying to get a flight to make the cruise that departed on 19 December from Singapore. After determining it was impossible to arrive in Singapore on time, the next port was Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. Initially, we were told by Princess/EZ Air we couldn’t fly into Malaysia because we didn’t have Visas.  After advising the representative that we didn’t need visas as US citizens to fly into Malaysia, she found a flight that arrived after 6:00pm on 21 December.  The ship was scheduled to depart Kota Kinabalu at 8:00pm on 21 December. I asked the representative if the ship would wait until we arrived, and I was advised it was our responsibility to make the ship before it departed and the ship would not wait for us. We asked for other flight options into Kota Kinabalu that arrived earlier and none were available. According to the ship, the airport is only 5 minutes away from the port. It wouldn’t have been an issue if the representative on the phone said the ship would wait for us. We were told by Princess/EZ Air we could fly into Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  After expressing that our Visas we applied for allowed entry into Nha Trang, Vietnam by cruise ship, we were told we couldn’t fly into Ho Chi Minh City. According to the ship, a Visa is issued upon arrival at the airport and we didn’t need a visa prior to arrival. We were told by Princess/EZ Air we could fly into Bangkok, Thailand. After hours of phone calls and being on hold all day, we wanted to cancel the cruise. We were told that Princess would not refund anything and to contact the travel insurance for any reimbursement.  We were also told that we would have to get to the ship to receive any reimbursement for the days we missed. Finally, Vanessa Cameron in Customer Assistance was able to help us. Vanessa said the ship would be expecting us on 27 December and that the room would be decorated for the anniversary celebration on 20 December. She also reiterated that the ship would reimburse us the missed days. We arrived at the ship on 27 December while docked in Laem Chabang, Thailand. Once we got on the ship, we were directed to our room where we discovered the room was not decorated as promised for the anniversary celebration on 20 December and the 3rd bed was not set-up in the cabin.  Our steward informed us that he did not know we were coming. It was apparent the ship was not expecting us after waiting for our ship cards and our room not being ready. We went to the customer service desk and spoke with customer relations manager, Nilesh Mohite. He informed us he could not tell us how much we would get reimbursed for the missed days and he had to wait for the stateside office to calculate the reimbursement amount.  We discussed our issues prior to arrival and discussed the issue with our room not being ready, and according to Nilesh, he entered a complaint on our behalf. The next day, our cruise account was adjusted for the 8 missed days. We were only reimbursed the daily amount according to our cruise fare. We asked Nilesh if we could disembark in Singapore on 30 December, and he said he would contact the stateside office. After meeting with Nilesh again, he changed our flights and we were scheduled to depart on 30 December from Singapore and we disembarked and ended the cruise early. Nilesh told us to contact customer relations to get our extra airfare reimbursed and the remaining 10 missed days reimbursed.</Text>

My parents used to love this cruise line.  They went on 8 cruises without a major hitch, then the 9th cruise happened... the only way I can describe it is a major medical malpractice issue coupled with a cruiseline "doctor" that clearly gets kick backs from hospital in St Lucia to strand unsuspecting healthy passengers there until they bleed them dry of all personal assets and then and only then will they release their hostages.  My dad needed some antibiotics and nothing else....  $50k+ later the hospital in St Lucia finally released him ONLY by way of a crazy expensive MEDEVAC flight to Florida.  The MEDEVAC crew felt so sorry for my parents because they knew it was a scam. The doctors in Florida checked him out and gave him a clean bill of health.  What the doctor from Princess cruise line did was completely UNETHICAL and CRIMINAL!   I expect stuff like that from a hospital in St Lucia, but not from Princess.  I will tell everyone I know to avoid them!!!<//review>

Anyway, the cruise is just to eat, eat and eat~❤😳
Then the waiter helped the nests arrange a super super powerful location, so beautiful windows~~~

<rate>2< /rate><text>(Translated by Google) Princess charged my visa account debit an incorrect amount. They debuted
about $ 800.00 over the correct amount. They do not understand that visa debit
they take it out automatically once they pass the card for authorization. Visa debit is cash from your bank account. It seems to me a lack of Princess to make incorrect debits.
The customer is respected, the customer service is very important.
Errors cost.

Good day!!!

Princess cargo a mi cuenta visa debito una cantidad incorrecta. Ellos debitaron
sobre $800.00 sobre la cantidad correcta. Ellos no entienden que visa debito
lo sacan automaticamente una vez pasan la tarjeta para autorizacion. Visa debito es dinero en efectivo de tu cuenta de banco. Me parece una falta de Princess hacer debitos incorrectos.
Al cliente se respeta, el trato al cliente es muy importante.
Los errors cuestan.

Honestly the worst experience of my life! We switched over from Verizon and were helped by associate Albert Durante (Aj) and not only was he very inappropriate and inexperienced but just had  horrible customer service. He called us back to the store after spending 3 hours trying in store, to notify us that he had made a mistake and had to do the transaction over. He one forgot to give us the tase in value for our devices, then ordered an extra iPhone. One I am still in the process of returning and getting my money back for. Thus, almost a month later we have still to see about $150 due to his mistake! I am just very upset and will never be visiting this location. This location is not a corporate location so I highly suggest calling the 611 number prior to going here. Horrible horrible horrible!!<//text>

Went to this  store because it was convenient , turns out it was the best decision of my life! c: Destiny was very helpful and got me the best phone should could! instead of treating me like a wallet she treated me like a friend and that is why I will only go to this store. highly recommended store <3< /Text>

IMHO, some of these reviews point to a CUSTOMER issue - NOT with the staff!!!!  The staff is fabulous.  Have had great help from Matt, Reyna, Kareem multiple times.  I drive past all the other stores closer to me just to go to this store.  They rock!!!!!</Text>

After coming from AT&T where I had nothing but issues it was nice to have a great experience with T-Mobile. Destiny was SO helpful and didn't try to take every penny that I had! She truly cares about what is best for her customers! Anyone that goes to the Riverbank store make sure to seek Destiny out! She will not disappoint.</text>

<Review>Great customer service! They know how to treat their customers. Went in completely stressed out, and destiny made everything a little easier with her great personality and customer service.

Bianca was very helpful and very professional.   Thank you for the great service.   AC was full blast but the windows need to be tinted since the area near them was very hot.<//Review>

<review>Kareem was very helpful with everything I had asked him to do. If I didn't understand he explained it to me so I did understand it. Me as and elderly person and don't know a lot about technology was very very helpful. I will come back to him for his help. I don't live in riverbank but willing to do the extra drive for his help.

Super sketchy that they always have a new manager ... there’s a reason for that. When I originally signed up I loved Tmobile and this store , Bobby was amazing  but the female manager that was there previously to this one now ruined Tmobile experience for me. Horrible service she added stuff to my account that I didn’t want . I went in there recently and it was extremely awkward new employee doesn’t even know how to take a payment it’s sad. I now go to the vintage faire mall or the on on McHenry.</Text>

Amazing customer service. Used them as a middle man for an FFL transaction and ended up buying several parts for my build as well. The worker threw in an extra part free of charge and gave some advice for the build. Would recommend for anyone local needing a firearm or purchasing one needing transfer services.<//text>

There was a strong vibration when driving my 4Runner at speeds over 40mph. Dustin replaced the U-Joints which solved the issue, and also replaced the car battery which was dead, all at a very fair price. A+ Service! I highly recommend this shop<//review>

I recently ran over a nail in almost brand new large truck tires, luckily it was not through the sidewall. I decided to call Valley Tire & Tackle in Fort Jones to see if they had time and the ability to repair my tire. They said it would be super quick and that yes they could fix it for around $10+ dollars.

So I went in around 45 minutes later. They quickly took the truck back into the shop and went about removing the tire and getting to work. After about 15 minutes they were done. They brought my truck back out front and told me no charge - on the house this time. So I gave the worker who helped a few dollars as a tip.

Overall, my first experience with them was fantastic. Customer service was outstanding, price (if I paid) was more than reasonable, and its local which I love to support where possible. I recommend giving these guys a call first before heading up to Medford or Yreka - give them a chance to earn your business. I will be returning.< /text>

< Review>
I have always loved Tandy. I wasntbexpectingbto go shopping in a leather store today but I was driving my motorcycle and I spotted Tandy! I screech on the brakes, did a u-turn and went inside and guess what?! This is the biggest Tandy I've ever seen! Call me sheltered but its true! They have bins and bins and more bins full of merchandise. I had a great time looking and I spent almost $20 on stuff I needed. The staff must be the owners, I forgot to ask but the were so friendly I almost  wanted to move in!< /Review>

You can count on Tandy  to satisfy the leather crafter. Supplies were just a bit on the shy side, limiting general selection. Covid era, in-store shopping is appreciated and there is plenty of parking and literally less than a minute off the freeway, access is breezy.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>First time in this store and I was immediatly hooked!! They have a very good selection on tools, leather and KITS!!! I also loved the prices on the metal stamps. The lady that assisted me was very nice and helpful. They offer classes on leather crafting (really inexpensive!!!), and a discount club, which gives you great prices on top of already good prices!!!! I highly recommend this store for all your leather projects.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

They expanded their hours for Tuesday and Thursday, now open till 8pm.
Wait for a sale to get almost anything.
The Military-Vets-LEO discount program is solid. Staff is generally knowledgeable and helpful, never felt like "you're a female why are you here" at all, which I appreciate.<//Text>

Great selection in a giant warehouse! Amateurs and pro leather crafters alike will dig this place. Love the view (soon to be obstructed) if Silverstrand from the entrance.<//Review>

I have always loved Tandy. I wasntbexpectingbto go shopping in a leather store today but I was driving my motorcycle and I spotted Tandy! I screech on the brakes, did a u-turn and went inside and guess what?! This is the biggest Tandy I've ever seen! Call me sheltered but its true! They have bins and bins and more bins full of merchandise. I had a great time looking and I spent almost $20 on stuff I needed. The staff must be the owners, I forgot to ask but the were so friendly I almost  wanted to move in!<//Text>

You can count on Tandy  to satisfy the leather crafter. Supplies were just a bit on the shy side, limiting general selection. Covid era, in-store shopping is appreciated and there is plenty of parking and literally less than a minute off the freeway, access is breezy.< /Text>

<Review>First time in this store and I was immediatly hooked!! They have a very good selection on tools, leather and KITS!!! I also loved the prices on the metal stamps. The lady that assisted me was very nice and helpful. They offer classes on leather crafting (really inexpensive!!!), and a discount club, which gives you great prices on top of already good prices!!!! I highly recommend this store for all your leather projects.< /Review>< response>

<review>The new manager is fantastic. He's from the north Hollywood store and he's helped me with my very small business/hobby so much!

They expanded their hours for Tuesday and Thursday, now open till 8pm.
Wait for a sale to get almost anything.
The Military-Vets-LEO discount program is solid. Staff is generally knowledgeable and helpful, never felt like "you're a female why are you here" at all, which I appreciate.</Text>

Met some friends for an early dinner on a Sunday. We arrived at 4 and we placed on the wait list which was 2.5 hours☹️. If you're going to eat here get here as early as possible or have one person get there to put their name on the list and then everyone shows up around the time they quoted. Our wait time ended up being 30 min less than quoted. They will only seat if your whole party is there. They do seat a lot of large groups. The place is clean and there's lots of people moving around, it's a pretty well oiled machine. Our server pulled up with a cart that had the menu and bibs, napkins, lemons, seasoning and ketchup. We started with some Cajun wings, which were surprisingly pretty good. No batter just seasoned and fried. I ordered chicken strips and fries basket. It was typical but the lemon pepper fries were good. I'm glad the strips weren't over cooked and my friends ordered shrimp and mussels then they added eggs. They said it was seasoned well and tasted very good.
Overall it was a nice establishment just need to remember the wait time. We will be back.</Text>

The food was delicious. I love the Cajun fresh fries. Im happy they accommodated to my disability as I have to use a cane to walk and I can't be standing for too long so they let us sit on a reserved spot while we waited for our table. Our waitress was really kind, brought us what we'd asked for, she definitely deserved her tip.. i would've given her more but unfortunately,  I gave her all the cash i had. I'd definitely go eat there again 😋 😏 thank you so much 💓 ❤<//Text>

There was about an 2 hour 1/2 wait. The service was good, but I don't recommend the crab fries it wasn't crab meat. The drinks was awesome, the food was ok but not great.<//Text>

The food taste never changes but if you love seafood you need to try the whole menu so you can pick your favorite. To me it all depends what I’m craving but 95 percent of the time is shrimp the whole shabang kick me. Make sure you put lemon on your salt and pepper and try it.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Rating>

We all got food poisoning, sick for whole week. One ER visit and one urgent care visit to get tested see what's wrong because I'm high risk pregnancy. Turned out to be one of the worst experiences of my life. Food poisoning lead to being given benadryl which lead to contractions which lead to subchorionic hemorrhage in my uterus TOTAL nightmare, was scared I was losing my baby. He's fine!!! Thank goodness.
Our purchase was 177 bucks so we paid good and were given food that made a family of five sick. Just be careful, I will not be trying this place again so sad man.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< time>

We always have the shrimp, oysters and lobster here. It's awesome and fresh. Just beware waits can be as long as 2 hrs specially during covid seating limitations. This palce was already crowed pre-covid. I like this particular location as is bigger than others and the wait is not as bad. Also because after a plentiful lunch or dinner there is a shopping mall near by where you can walk it off.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<name>Timothy Shorts<//name><review>Had a surprising treat for all catfish lovers in orange county. It's the best. The facility also are very health conscious while dealing with our COVID environment. No mask no service and no entry. Their shrimp are the bomb also. Highly recommended 👌< /review>< Response>

Delicious food every time!!! This place never disappoints, their shebang sauce on shrimp is yummy! Don’t forget about the Cajun fries!

The only thing I don’t look forward to is the wait... or the fact that you can’t bring outside drinks (ex. boba) the server was nice about it and was able to save my boba in a fridge. But really this place sees a $3 drink as competition? As if I’m not going to spend money on seafood, apps etc... how annoying...

FYI don’t forget to ask for gloves if you are like me and don’t like the smell remaining on your fingers. They don’t ask you, so you have to ask for them.<//Text>

<Review>All I gotta say is that this place is the BOMB ever since my friend took me here I couldn’t stop think about it . It is COVID friendly everyone is spaced out to COVID regulations. And have to where a face mask upon entering. Shrimps are so massive and juicy , I buy THE WHOLE SHA-bang  which is a mixture of all the seasons . I live my spice so I get I CANT FEEL MY MOUTH . Always make sure u buy ur rice and Cajun seasoning fries.< /Review>< pics>

Pretty good experience.

The fries here were amazing! Very crispy on the outside and mushy inside!

The seafood here was overall fresh. We ordered shrimps, king crab legs and Dungeness crab with mixed seasoning. The seasoning was very flavourful and enjoyable! The corns that we added into the bags were so good!!

We had experienced a problem where we ordered 2 fresh, live Dungeness crab and one had an obvious foul, ammonia smell compare to the other one. We asked one of the waitress and she just responded that they only had the live crab at the time so they are all fresh, even though they offered the option of ordering the frozen crab. We later mentioned the problem to another waiter Bhu, he was very helpful on report the problem to kitchen and gave us a discount on one crab.

Overall our family had an excellent time!<//text>

<Review>OMG!!! This place is amazing. I wish I could've brought this place back to Houston, TX with me. So good! So worth the wait. The wait time was an hour to an hour and a half so we decided to take it to go. That was a wait too. The place was super clean and well maintained, even the restroom. The house was packed with locals, that's always a good sign. We had to drive 20 minutes just to get back to our Airbnb to enjoy our meal. I ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of snowcrab, and a corn. They were all amazing. Seasoned all the way through, just like home! Unfortunately, even though you order snowcrab by the pound which is about 2 clusters, they don't do that. It's about 1 cluster. I was so hurt, because they were so amazing. The staff were great and very friendly and patient. I will definitely revisit again if I'm ever back in CA.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdmsIV6_ryVSobESYe-wuXNmrTw5oBvEbasWF1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN5V4bou4mE9OMTCYatBIm5FFIu6fR_-FuDO15=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnnyU7d2CbVQYZg0E7fbB-2JFH2CRUJ-KI7Hqi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8bgRZOQyW-Wj4tKU8qaIB5BVvrmvEzpUKPXIC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7J3dKF4XNELLhFijJgbuhWJfQxNE9j6ES5S0F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMja2wgwqySABHAdyA2tyC7Va7Qp0MfYAl7S_yl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFFarWiNORSIvnCpWC3DbCnBiuXtSpNiC5K8MC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzuGIzh3nWPVSAIAzmt_khCWfAEjEG6ss4ETnv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMmqXdBKW6BvjDEsWnxg1de8LqflQyx2XYE-Tx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

After picking up the order and taking it home it was still hot, luckily they provide wax paper to place on the table to spread out the food making easy to pick at. Overall it was good besides having to deal with the mess at home, but it's better than having it closed and unable to serve any food.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Great food and friendly service! Excellent covid protocols in place with masks, barriers, and social distancing. Market prices are up a bit, but obviously not under their control, and they are still a good value compared to other seafood places. My order was correct and included all the condiments without having to ask.</Review><Rate>5</Rate>< Gmap_id>

I love the shrimp and catfish here... The wait times suck sometimes but its always worth the wait, unless they take forever in bringing my food. I get hangry. I recommend coming here during the week when its not so busy.<//text>

Pretty good experience.

The fries here were amazing! Very crispy on the outside and mushy inside!

The seafood here was overall fresh. We ordered shrimps, king crab legs and Dungeness crab with mixed seasoning. The seasoning was very flavourful and enjoyable! The corns that we added into the bags were so good!!

We had experienced a problem where we ordered 2 fresh, live Dungeness crab and one had an obvious foul, ammonia smell compare to the other one. We asked one of the waitress and she just responded that they only had the live crab at the time so they are all fresh, even though they offered the option of ordering the frozen crab. We later mentioned the problem to another waiter Bhu, he was very helpful on report the problem to kitchen and gave us a discount on one crab.

Overall our family had an excellent time!</review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Rotten clams and mushy shrimps--that's what's for dinner!  Is it just my luck or has this happened to someone else before?  I called the restaurant and was told I needed to bring everything back to the restaurant in order to get a refund.  Well, I had already thrown out the bad seafood!!  Didn't want it in my house a second longer, why would a restaurant want that contamination in their restaurant?  Plus, it would be an hour ordeal to and back from the restaurant.
They served rotten food, where's the integrity? Now they are making me grovel, beg and go through further inconvenience in order for them to make things right?  I don't get it....needless to say, I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE GROVELING that evening.  Why bother with such unreasonable management of a business.< /review></record>

You can ask for 1 pound of shrimp or 2. No halfs no nothing. The shrimps are unpeeled, so have some fun using your fingers!

The place is pretty awesome too, it has plenty of seats and different sitting configurations, booths, tables, bars, etc.

OMG!!! This place is amazing. I wish I could've brought this place back to Houston, TX with me. So good! So worth the wait. The wait time was an hour to an hour and a half so we decided to take it to go. That was a wait too. The place was super clean and well maintained, even the restroom. The house was packed with locals, that's always a good sign. We had to drive 20 minutes just to get back to our Airbnb to enjoy our meal. I ordered a pound of crawfish, a pound of snowcrab, and a corn. They were all amazing. Seasoned all the way through, just like home! Unfortunately, even though you order snowcrab by the pound which is about 2 clusters, they don't do that. It's about 1 cluster. I was so hurt, because they were so amazing. The staff were great and very friendly and patient. I will definitely revisit again if I'm ever back in CA.</Text>

They were extremely busy so we had to take the food to go, however the girl at the counter was super helpful and patient with us, and explained how to order. The food was amazing, little pricey but definitely worth it.< /review>

Oh my goodness.  This place is very much worth the wait, and the hype.  It started a bit awkward bc there were things I wanted that weren't on the menu.  The waiter made up for the inconvenience by suggesting other dishes that were more appropriate, and filling.  In fairness to the restaurant, our party arrived   close to closing time. I had the shrimp,  half pound...mind you  these shrimp still had the heads.  Never experienced that before. Quite the experience.  Also had King crab.  It was delicious.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys seafood.  Oh the also had a precarious way of setting the tables.  Wax paper instead of table cloths.  You need a plastic bib as well. You do get messy. Check them out,  and get there early  for a better selection.</Text>

Went in on Sunday and was told a 2 hour wait.  Went back on Monday and after a strip search was allowed to sit.  There is no clear menu, so you just kind of wing it?  No beer but budweiser then no orange to go with blue moon ( a coors product? ).  Just poor service with a bad business plan.  Won't attempt to give them money again.  Oh and from what I seethe food comes out in a plastic bag?< /review>

<Time>1560650790625< /Time><review>Excellent place.  The whole shabanf with XXX spice is just the right combination of heat and saltiness for shrimp and crawfish.  It may be overwhelming for some items like the clams amd mussels.  The gumbo is incredible as are the fried soft shell crabs.  The sweet potatoes are ok.  The corn, sausages, and potatoes are what you would expect.  No matter what, do NOT order the cajun chowder.  So disgusting.  I still give the place a 5 since their original sauces are so good and they have live crawfish when in season.<//review><rating>5</rating></record>

< Review>
Food was pretty good, service was fantastic.

Only issue is the price is through the roof for boil-in-bag seafood. We get our bill for two adults, we think it comes out to ~$90, but it turns out that was just for HALF the meal, and the total was actually ~$150.
We ordered a little heavy and took home leftovers, but in my opinion, $150 for food for ~3 adults in this atmosphere is about 20-30% too high.

It was gonna be two stars but our waiters were bros.<//Review>

<review>I like the taste. I was one of their first customers since the very first store on Euclid Garden Grove. 1998 - 2005 I think. I know the cost of things can increase over the years but I still think this has gotten way overpriced or overcharged for what it’s worth. So I don’t really go dine-in here anymore hardly over the years. If I have the craves, I’d get 1-2 lbs crawfish, small order wings, clams and whatnot. I also don’t eat a lot of stuff here except crawfish is my main choice. Being overcharged also limit my ordering other things. I loved the oysters here as well but that too gone up to $22/dozen I think. So not worth it. Plus I try to avoid eating oysters now for safety concerns. So, I’d probably eat once in 6 mos not only that only 2-3 lbs crawfish and other limited things due to its ridiculously priced. It is not fine dining here. C’mon. There’s a difference in paying good quality items at the right cost where it should cost vs. being overcharged. Meaning even if you have the means to pay, you just opt not to pay for overpriced things. Just me! 3 stars for that reason. After all, rating evaluate dining experience, cost, and other things that make something quality,  not only taste.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< review>
Way too expensive, messy, and food was not good at all.. Take a look at the pictures I've attached. It was an $80 mess for only 1 teenage son and myself.

My teenage son and I had dinner there to celebrate my birthday. Price on the menu for crab only said MARKET VALUE....I figured the damage couldn't be too bad if we ordered just one pound (the minimum order amount). He wanted shrimp and clams. We got the minimum order of those also and 1 fries and 1 soda. A whopping $80 bill came at the end of all this untasty mess.... I couldn't believe it. The food was not very good at all. I had a stomach ache after. For all this money,  they just put a plastic baggy of your entres on your table with half of it swimming in a messy liquid sauce. You have to dig into this mess and peel your own shrimp and cut the heads off yourself. The crab, you have to handle the painfully thorny shells as you break the shell to scrape out scraps of leg meat. The furniture is old and outdated wooden picnic tables and hard bench seats with aged and dirty looking dark varnish finish from probably the 70s or 80s (it appeared but not sure of actual age). They give you a cheap plastic bib like age babies bib, and cover the picnic table in plastic so it makes it easy for them to clean your table afterwards.

For $80 for a teenage son and myself to have a terrible dinner, it was a complete dissapointment and I will NEVER go back..... YUKK !

NOTE TO OWNER....POST THE ACTUAL PRICE OF THE CRAB AND OTHER ENTRE''S ON THE MENU INSTEAD OF JUST SAYING "MARKET VALUE".....A nice trick !</review>

<Review>Over priced food. The food was good but I spent $180 for a family of four and we left hungry. The raw oyster we had were the best item. Crisp and fresh but on the small size. The wait was also quite long so I suggest you call in or allocate 1+ hour to wait. Be there with your whole party because they wi give away your table if you are not all there. This was the case for many ahead of us in queue.<//Review>< date>

Best seafood place to eat shrimp, lobster, calamari, oysters, clams, fries, and crab. Always fresh seafood that is well seasoned. Customer service is awesome. They are so attentive and helpful. The only bad thing is that sometimes the waiting time is about an hour or more, but it is worth the wait.< /text>

<Review>The place is amazing. Food tastes absolutely like a charm.
Portions are fine, a pound per each item is decent.

Use both hands, no forks/knives/spoons, to eat. We enjoyed the food. Thanks for the experience.<//Review>< pics>

Best catfish in Cali. Not that pond raised stuff you get everywhere else. The staff is wonderful. They waste no time in seating you for a pleasurable experience. The food is excellent and the michaladas are to die for. If you are in Santa Ana and get hungry, stop here. You won’t be disappointed.<//review>

Cut loose a little and let your inner caveman or cavewoman out to play. Don't be afraid to get a little dirty eating here. It's worth it.< /text>< username>

I would suggest take out if you're really craving seafood.

Enjoyed a fun and unique seafood experience here. Basically you order your seafood of choice by the pound, any add ins, and choose your seasoning. It comes out in a bag and then you peel and eat. We order shrimp and clams with corn and sausage. The seafood was delicious. Even on a weeknight it was very busy so be prepared for a bit of a wait.<//Text>

The food was amazing. They gave a great combination of sauces. The wait time was crazy ridiculous but we were able to sit by the bar and have some drinks. Even though the drinks selection was limited.< /Review>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>Not worth the time to wait/the food you get. It seems like there is always a wait whenever we pass by, so we decided to have an early dinner at 5pm, yet there was still a 10 minute wait.

Now when it comes to the food, you are only able to order the seafood in 1 pound increments and the sides in 1/2 pound increments, although I did hear some tables around us getting things like 1 1/2 pounds of seafood. 🤷‍♀️

For a party of 2, we ordered 1lb of king crab legs (which equaled to 4 legs), 1lb of crawfish, 1/2lb sausage, 1 corn on the cob, a soft shell crab & fries appetizer, and 2 beers. The total for all that came out to a little over $100 including the tip.

The king crab leg shells were so soft to crack open that I ended up slicing my finger open and had to ask for bandages. 😣

All of the crew were very friendly and attentive, so kudos to that.

Probably won’t be returning anytime soon.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Delicious food! I recommend the Cajun Wings and Cajun fries. Bathrooms are kinda clean, and the service is quick and speedy, unless you order Cajun Wings that takes a long time.</Review>

This is a guilty pleasure favorite. I know when I done here, my meal will be satisfying. I love their Whole Sha-bang Sauce (all sauces mixed together). I am a spicy level  mild type due to the next level being too much of a jump. I recommend getting an order of streamed rice to have your sauce something to be poured over. You can't go wrong with adding sausage to your seafood. Nothing wrong with ordering a basket of Cajun fries to start your dining experience.<//Text>

I went with some friends, and while it wasn't my favorite place ever, it definitely has some quality points. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it too much but came away pleasantly surprised. I didn't try too much though so maybe the other times are even better then what I had thusfar so definitely check it out and give it a go.

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I was a little nervous after reading some of the recent reviews, but we really liked this location.  It wasn't terribly busy when we arrived at 5pm on a Tuesday night, so that may have helped.  We much preferred the spacious interior where you weren't packed in like sardines like you are in Garden Grove.  I'm guessing their tip share policy is the reason others were displeased with the service, but all four or five people who waited on us did a fine job.  We don't go frequently enough to be certain, but most of us felt the sauce may not have been quite as hot as before, but it was actually just right.  So between the larger space and slightly closer distance, this will be our go-to Boiling Crab location.< /Review>< Pics>

Very casual fun place with family and friends. Long waiting time but worth it. Best fresh oysters and nice size shrimps. Good place for kids too. Non seafood includes fantastic chicken wings, sweet potatoes and regular potatoe fries with seasonings. Friendly, fast service.<//review>

This place is delicious. Food is soo good, well seasoned. Mechiladas are one of the best. Service is great! Definitely get there early though or it can take an hour to be seated. This is a large location and they still get packed really quick.< /review>

Enjoyed the Fried Catfish and crab by the bucket.
I would suggest for the Fried Catfish...instead of 4 medium piece's I would suggest 6 piece's.
Worth the many that you pay< /review>

This is one of the least busy boiling crabs I've been to. Came at opening and there was no line. The service was EXTREMELY SLOW. We got most of our order but was missing one bag of snow crab legs. Took 20 more minutes for those to come out. Would give them another shot but not impressed at all with the service.</Review>

My bffs and I came in on a Monday around 7 pm. Surprisingly, we were seated quickly once we told the receptionist that everyone in our party was present. Customers service is quick and very attentive. I love it when i dont have to beg for attention from the wait staff. They always make sure that our drinks are filled or refilled if needed. Food is provided very quickly.< /review>

I like going to Boiling Crab during the weekdays when the wait isn’t so long. During the weekends there’s always a long line, and it could take up to 1 hour and 30 minutes of waiting. I like having shrimp in the whole Shabang sauce. It tastes really rich. And the clams are fresh, I have never had fishy clams here. But always remember to ask for the market price when ordering crab or lobster. I have a friend who had a traumatized experience ordering king crab legs without asking the price beforehand...< /Review>

Good but way too expensive! $14/lb for shrimp. Go to Seafood City and get some headless shrimp for $6/lb. Fried shrimp basket was also pretty good but they only gave you like 5 pieces and a lot of dry fries. Service was great, but the waitress initially denied my American Express card. I told her about the Amex logo outside the door so she went to double check and eventually took my card... Kinda silly to not know what valid forms of payment your restaurant takes.</Review>

<Review>My bffs and I came in on a Monday around 7 pm. Surprisingly, we were seated quickly once we told the receptionist that everyone in our party was present. Customers service is quick and very attentive. I love it when i dont have to beg for attention from the wait staff. They always make sure that our drinks are filled or refilled if needed. Food is provided very quickly.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Worst service ever!!! Waited 2 hours to only find out at the end that there system was down. Nobody bothered letting us know wouldn’t you think it’s your company responsibility to let guest know they can’t sit to eat because they system is down. Thanks this location is the worst from all the boiling crabs ever!!<//Review>

Love crab! Usually a wait on the weekend. It's super messy as the food comes in bags instead of a plate so don't go here for a first date! Sauces are flavorful and hot. It's fun to just not care and make a mess  everywhere.< /review>

Excellent customer service,  they work in teams.  Seasoning very good,  I got the medium was a little too spicy to taste the garlic so much, but it had a nice kick to it. Everything was delish, service excellent, would've liked lemons w my shrimp not limes but still good (maybe it's cost)
Prices very reasonable and great portion sizes for the cost. Will return again and again and bring friends fun place!!<//Review>

I love that now you can set yourself and/or party on the waitlist thru your mobile device. And it gives us an estimated time and how many parties are ahead of you! That's an awesome feature!< /Text>

< Review>
Tried to Order tonight over the phone but the person was unprofessional and responded “Hi” and then hung up after I asked to place an order. I called again and no answer until the third call and someone finally answered. I decided to add something to my order but was told that they had turned off the fryer 20 minutes before closing. As a manager of a restaurant I know that was not professional and not allowed, especially 20 minutes before closing. How will you close the kitchen if you still have customers still ordering. The lady in front desk was rude and didn’t look like she even asked the cook to see if I could add something to my order. I was very disappointed and disgusted with the customer service I received tonight.< /Review>

It was a plus to know that it was 5 minutes from my hotel. I performed at the 32nd Annual Long Beach Jazz Festival that weekend so knowing I was going to visit my favorite Sefood spot was a treat, not to mention that I was also celebrating my birthday. I live in Houston Texas and for some reason, the Boiling Crab shut their doors quite a few years back. It was a spot I frequently visited and can't find anything else that was comparable. The crawfish, when in season, is always a staple along with the other shellfish they serve. My personal favorite is either the Snowcrab or Kingcrab in the mild cajun sauce. I love that combination/mixture of vietnamese & cajun seasoning! It's truly addictive! You can also find what's called "The whole Shabang", which is a combination of all the seasonings thrown together, salty, buttery, sweet and very garlicky.

In essence, theres no place like it. The customer service, considering it's always a packed house, is excellent. They treat you like you are the only one in the room. I highly recommend this spot if your ever in the westcoast and crave shellfish. I look forward to my next visit!!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<text>We waited to hours when telling us an hour and a half. When we got our table we ordered straight away. Our wings came with no fries. They got our order Wong and didn’t even put seasoning. We were waiting for our fries which only one came in the next half hour. With all that we had to pay $135.< /text><rating>1</rating>< name>

Got dragged here by some coworkers, even though they know I don't eat seafood. Got here and it was an hour wait. I've been to another location before so I expected it. Luckily, they have cheap beer you can get from the counter so that helped. I got chicken strips, which weren't bad, but nothing special, but I do realize that it isn't their specialty. Our server was nice and food came out fairly quickly.</text>

This place is got pretty good seafood but it can get kind of crowded sometimes so it's best to come when it's not too crowded. I would have gave you five stars except sometimes you have to wait awhile to get your food. It's got a good shopping center and it's around other great shopping centers. In area there's a lot of things to do if you'd like to go around doing things.< /review>

My circuits loves this place. The snow crab is great but pricy. Also mild is still very hot. Better to ask for no heat if your not into spicy.< /Review>

The food is so good! But there is always a wait on the weekends you will wait 2 hours. It's worth the drive and wait if you like shrimp or crab.<//Review>

<name>Melissa Reynolds</name><Time>1515970025128< /Time><rating>2< /rating><Text>While the service and waitstaff is friendly, the food and pricing is subpar. Everything is a la carte, so we paid market price ($20 each) for crab legs, but had to order all of our side dishes separately. Other seafood restaurants include their sides with their market price. Fries and potatoes aren't that expensive. Just give them to your customers so they feel like they've gotten their money's worth.
The way it's prepared is weird too. They dream your crab legs in the butter in a bag, so you have to try to figure out how to eat this slippery thing. Why not serve the butter on the side?
We were given no crab crackers, so it was nearly impossible to get into the shells.

It tasted okay, just not worth the money when other restaurants comparable to this one do it so much better.<//Text>< pics>

<rating>4</rating><text>Got dragged here by some coworkers, even though they know I don't eat seafood. Got here and it was an hour wait. I've been to another location before so I expected it. Luckily, they have cheap beer you can get from the counter so that helped. I got chicken strips, which weren't bad, but nothing special, but I do realize that it isn't their specialty. Our server was nice and food came out fairly quickly.</text>< user>

<text>Worst customer service , I order food To take out and I didn’t get my order of oysters . I call them back and they just told me they were going to call me back , later on I receive a call from the manager saying they did give me the oysters that she check the cameras , like seriously ? Checking the cameras ? , if I’m calling to tell you that I didn’t receive my oysters it’s bc I didn’t receive them. I pay for the oysters for nothing and they didn’t even try to refund me the money or at least to give me my oysters.< /text>< pics>

<text>Long waits but it's worth it! I love getting a pound of shrimp, whole shebang. Highly recommend, it's fun with a group of friends since there are no utensils and you eat right off the table and everyone just plays with their food.</text>< Pics>

Great place for some flavorful seafood.

There's typically a wait so plan ahead and don't go when you are hungry.</text>

<Review>Always a fun time & great food - at any of their locations.  Expect to eat with your hands on butcher paper! (so don't wear anything you love that can't be easily washed - when you leave you will smell of yumminess) - yes they have cool lobster bibs for everyone!!  If you have enough people or have enough room in your tummy, get the gumbo, fried catfish basket, and lemon pepper chicken wings!! I prefer the whole dungeness crab over the blue crab.  Shrimp is a good choice loved by many.  If anyone in your party hasn't had crawfish before, then I'd start with a 1 lbs bag.  Get the corn & sausage - you won't be disappointed. I prefer the fries over the boiled potatoes.  If you have a group that requires different levels of spiciness, then order one bag at the highest spiciness level (for dipping), then order all common bags to be at the lowest spiciness level. Lemonade is good! Great prices on beer! no dessert available (luckily there are plenty of dessert places nearby)< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80dcdf2d944788c7:0x8d93c5c4ab8098c2<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Always go eat the XXX Rajin Cajun. There's no other right way to eat these shrimps. Best way is to eat them all the way through, don't stahp for water. Maybe take a a few bites out of a potato, dipped in your XXX sauce of course. The feeling you get at the end is euphoria.<//text>

Staff always so attentive, but what set this location apart was the fact was the spaciousness and the giant whirling windmill fan in the center.< /review>

<Text>Always go eat the XXX Rajin Cajun. There's no other right way to eat these shrimps. Best way is to eat them all the way through, don't stahp for water. Maybe take a a few bites out of a potato, dipped in your XXX sauce of course. The feeling you get at the end is euphoria.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQixTfO0T9RAVAFCNepWszwd4WzXmciivoYIY_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dcdf2d944788c7:0x8d93c5c4ab8098c2< /gmap_id></record>

< review>
The staff was great, super friendly! Even called the manger over, to let her know how much we enjoyed it at this location, more than others we frequent more often. She was really nice, as well. We talked a little bit about the seafood and where they get it from. Also about maybe them adding a sign more towards the main street to bring in more ppl, since they were so far in the back. There was hardly any wait. Seriously 5 mins or less. I will be going back!< /review>

<text>It doesn't taste the same anymore. The taste of the Shabang is not as strong as it use to be. The sauce has no flavor, it was extremely watered down.

1st time.  A bit confusing, much of the prices are marketplace, which I understand, but you have to ask more questions than you want to to find out what's what price.  So decided on the shrimp it was 14 bucks a pound, seemed cheap, she asked what side?  Red potatoes, small additional $3 additional. But you don't want just shrimp and spice because it goes in a bag.  I also ordered Catfish and 🍟 automatically comes with.  So guy delivers bag of shrimp and says catfish coming.  I'm like hold on this is plenty and I was hungry, they cancelled order, that would have been way too much food. Now the food is fresh, but you have to peel the shrimp out with your hands it was a lot of work, so everyone's table was a mess.  You get a bib and a paper layed over top yo just throw your shells.  I had to ask the mom and daughter next to me how do you peel this they showed me on her plate so flipping nice of them, saved me.  Fun, tiring, priced right I thought if you know what to order.  I got out for about $25, including a beer.   Imbnotba huge fan of shrimp, but was priced right, I wanted the crab but I was a bit intimidated didn't want to walk out dropping $60 on dinner, next time I'll just get crab and side Ill see how that works. She was just suggesting I need to get multiple things; not sure I need to.  Wouldn't suggest bringing kids here if they're a first timer unless the parents want to do double work.  Would have been perfect to have some yummy buttered bread or a side of rice Ill have to check on that next time  when I'm not such a newbie.I bet they don't serve great bread but I get why, they want people to buy more fish.  Until next time Mr. Crab, coming for you.<//review>

Over priced and overcooked. Really crowded. Dont understand why so many people think this place is worth it. My crab at $32 per pound was not good.

I had to ask the mom and daughter next to me how do you peel this they showed me on her plate so flipping nice of them, saved me.  Fun, tiring, priced right I thought if you know what to order.  I got out for about $25, including a beer.

You love shrimp and seafood.. Place to go eat.. Can get expensive depending what you order.. But for a pound of shrimp $10 you can't beat.< /Text>

My family absolutely loves eating here. My kids love peeling the shrimp on their own. Arrived a little before 5 pm and only waited about 10 minutes for a table for 6. Perfect timing. The whole sha-bang medium shrimp is delicious! We added corn and potatos. Paired with Cajun fries.....heaven.  Frosty Pacifico with a lime wedge to top it off. Bomb dot com. Servers were very friendly and attentive. I've been to the garden grove location. This one is my favorite. Definitely our go to spot on pay day. 😉</text>

If you haven't ever been to boiling crab, what are you waiting for?  This place has a great balance of delicous cajun style seafood and economical pricing.

For me:
I go Cajun style med. shrimp and fries the same way with a cold soda. Yum.< /text>

Great food definitely worth the wait. Although sometimes I have waited close two hours. But still great place if you love shrimp with the whole shabang medium spicy with Cajon mild fries.<//text>

<Text>I just got back from Louisiana a few weeks ago and was craving crawfish again. They had live crawfish available for $14 per lb. IT TASTED EXACTLY LIKE WHEN I WAS THERE SITTING NEXT TO THE FREAKING MISSISSIPPI RIVER!!!!! It was so great! The wait was an hour but we were able to sit on some stools in a waiting area and order beer! How is that for freakin convenience!??! All around 5 stars! Well done Boiling Crab..... Well done.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Shrimp and king crab is great here. Unless you come early expect to wait at least 2 hours, but every time I'm done eating I think to myself, totally worth it.</text>

you have not lived until you've ordered boiling crab to go...  and eat it in all its glory at home, with wholeshabang all over your face and no one there to judge.

calling in to order can be a little tough (think trying to win drake tickets from a radio station), but i did give it a couple of tries and eventually it went through.

took about 20-25 minutes for the order to be ready, but definitely beats waiting for a table for 1.5-2 hours!

they provide all the condiments you can possibly need to enjoy your feast at home, including fresh limes, salt and pepper, and ketchup.  bibs and table liners are not included though...  not sure if you can ask :)

with the convenience of it all, it's great if you don't want to wait for a table, but do count on lukewarm wholeshabang and cajun fries by the time you get home :(< /Review>

< review>
Boiling Crab!!! I have been to this location a few times & still hasn't disappointed. My most recent visit was this past Friday night with a group of 4 friends. The line was terribly long but the hostess asked us if we didn't mind taking a table for 4 and add a chair at the end. Of course I said "yes"...either wait 30-40 minutes or get seated right away. It was a no brainer.

I ordered the typical pound of shrimp, medium with the whole sha'bang. No need to go into detail about what it is but just in case your not familiar it's all the seasoning into one bag. I also ordered "XXX Cajun Fries". Wow these fries are super hot!!! Make sure you order a cold beer because you will need it. I prefer the fries extra hot because the flavor is better than the mild.

The service is always good here, well at least for me. Multiple servers were around to ensure the customers were happy with there food & experience. I was so glad we got there when we did because there were a flood of people in the front of the restaurant waiting for tables. I overheard the hostess say average wait was anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour. Eesh...Come early!</review>

<Review>I recommended we celebrate a friends 50th birthday here and was I sorry I did.  There was a 40 minute gap between when the first of us got our food and the last of us got our food.  Unfortunately it was the birthday girl who got her food last.  I was very embarrased. We had to waive our hands in the air to get a refill on drinks.  When I complained to the manager, her attitude was it SUCKS FOR YOU!!!  I will never go back and eat there again!!!!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

SHA-BANG sauce yum!

I love, LOVE eating at boiling crab.  I enjoy eating their pounds of shrimp, dungeons crabs, corn in cob all in the SHA-BANG sauce along with the sweet potato fries and a dozen of oysters. YUMMY!  I always CRAVE for it and wish I can eat it all the time. The boiling crab in Santa Ana is hip, very spacious and they provide flat screen TV's in every wall, great for entertainment and sports bars.  They have a big parking lot, but sometimes can be ridiculous to find a spot because this place gets really pack. Good customer service and friendly staff.

Tip: Try to come during non-peak hours for less wait time.< /review>

Amazing, The only minor problem is that if the place gets full and you have a large group with you it takes a while for them to find you a table, on the other hand, this is an amazing restaurant with a friendly service and with a great food quality< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Everything is super tasty ... those sauces with which lobster legs are made and shrimp have no "M".

(Original)
Super sabroso todo.. esas salsas con las que están hechas las patas de la langosta y los camarones no tienen "M".</Text>

(Translated by Google) Crabs are divided into fresh and fresh, and must be fresh, and the meat is super fresh.
The oysters are also super delicious. There is absolutely no rust in Taiwan. If this is a very good one, Taiwan will probably eat two points.
Crabs must be ordered with oysters, and the service is also very good.
Fried chicken breasts are fine, a little over the firewood, you can not use

(Original)
螃蟹有分冷凍跟新鮮的，一定要點新鮮的，肉質超新鮮。
生蠔也超級好吃，完全沒有臺灣生蠔不新鮮的鐵鏽味，如果這間是十分，臺灣吃到最好吃的大概才兩分。
螃蟹跟生蠔必點，服務也很好
炸雞胸肉就還好，有點過柴，可以不用點</text>

(Translated by Google) A super different experience, something out of the ordinary, but above all really great, if you are very comemlon ask for the full pound of shrimp, but in addition to that they have Blue gran, ostionea, king crab, snow crab legs, lobster, crawfish, clams and mussels, there are 4 sauces the best for me is the Rajun Cajun, also the fried calamari is highly recommended

(Translated by Google) It is an interesting concept to eat seafood, served in a bowl, with your bib and tablecloth, so as not to stain your clothes, I liked the breaded squid 😋
