< Review>
Make a pizza at least the quality of a .99 frozen pizza. It was cold, doughy, not cooked and had a tablespoon of sauce. It made me SICK! AND, THE TOTAL WAS $30 for delivery to a hotel room. Pathetic!<//Review>

My order was wrong again.  I ordered 4 pizzas, one of which was a thin crust pepperoni and sausage.  It was just a cheese.  This has happened two other times in the past 3 months.</Text>

<review>There is a wonderful manager that I have never seen before at the Castaic location and he is doing a wonderful job.
I think his name is James? He is really sweet and took my order with a smile, even got my food to me under the 15 minutes despite him being the only one there.
The delivery drivers were gone on a delivery and the other lady wearing the same shirt went somewhere out of the store.
I will deffinently be coming back!!!!<//review>< name>

We went into the store to order a pizza at about 10:20 or 10:30 pm or so. No one was available to provide service for 10 minutes.  We waited but nobody ever showed and my daughter just walked out.  I called the store the,next day 10/11/2017 and asked if explained what he'd occurred the night before.  The acting manager said she wasn't there but maybe the staff was in the freezer or bathroom? I then said don't people usually lock the door to do those things. The acting manager said that's what she would have done but she couldn't speak for that situation. I'm still confused about why enough staff wasn't  available to handle our order, or why wouldn't staff lock the door to use a restroom or go into freezer, and lastly was there only one person working? I think maybe a real manager needs to address this issue and I will try to call back when one is on duty. This should,not occur because they could be robbed or a staff could have been ill or in a dangerous situationand no other staff available to help . We didn't even see other customers. Was the store closed and they forgot to lock up?<//review>

<username>Anthony D</username><Text>This pizza hut is the worst, and probably the worst customer service of any business in Castaic. Every time we've ordered from them, the pizza is late, cold, missing ordered toppings, etc. I've had multiple conversations with the manager and it doesn't make a difference. They have absolutely no concern or care for their customers.. absolutely none.<//Text><Rate>1< /Rate><user_id>105478410514898191913<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80c27e50e31657db:0x289f3b9122620211</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Second time I've been here for lunch and the place looks deserted called 30 minutes in advance for a PERSONAL PIZZA and yet still there's a wait the two customers that were in front of me trying to place a order just walked out unhelped! The older guy is there by himself and he's very rude and does not greet customers.... had to say excuse me hello about three times before he replied back with hold on a minute I'll be there? Good thing my pizza was hot because I would have shoved it right back to him! Would never order here again!!</text>

The pizza was very cold when it arrived, and we were very disappointed at how little the toppings they put on. The pasta however was much better< /Review>

This place is ridiculously filled with gnats covering the windows. They have a fan to keep the bugs out but they have it turned off. Wonder how many gnats landed on my food while they prepared it. 😣< /review>

<Text>We got felafel wrap and the combo platter. As much as we appreciate the effort to twist the  Mediterranean cuisine this was simple not good. I’m sorry to say but the spices didn’t come together, the meat was dry, the felafel was with texture resembling a rubber. We really hate throwing food but this was not eatable. Management really needs to adjust prices and quality 🤙🏼</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAeYNVXStXUkp1PyB7K0shL1UBF2QAloFkQwr_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPx2FgjsC4OX4msJze0xRxjWeUPyxQ2S5NSGksT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

<text>I got the Combo Platter, it was quite good actually.  It seemed a little pricey at first, but once I got the food, it felt like there was plenty of food to warrant the ~18 price.

Our first visit here and certainly not our last! The Mediterranean food is very good quality with excellent sauces. Prices are very reasonable. The portions are a tad smaller but the quality is worth it. The owners are exceptionally friendly and kind people. My lady and I will be back not just for the food but for the service ^_^</Text>

Had a couple of falafel wraps, both were great. A perfect balance of spice, heat and flavor.

<text>I absolutely am just so obsessed with this place! Their food has so much flavor and the staff is just so out of this world nice. I had the Hawaiian burger with a vegetarian patty and it's hands down the BEST patty i've had (meat patties are included in my rating). I just LOVE this place and their employees.

Best Turkish delight ever. The burgers were good, a bit overdone for my tastes, and the fries were nothing special, but the Turkish delight... Every flavor was delicious. Bought two of all of them. Same with the baklava.<//text>

< Review>
The food is very standard and the portions are fairly small for the price. I paid $25 for a gyro wrap (on the small side), and a Gyros platter, also on the small side; drinks were separate. The flavor was very standard, but what my attention was the fact that the tomatoes in the wrap were sliced and not in pieces as they would normally be (evidently they slice for the salads o who knows why, but it shows "effort" on the part of the employees). Also, they would not lend the bathroom to my autistic son claiming that it was against the law to do so (we went to another restaurant nearby and they did let him use it). Overall, the size of the portions was more adequate for a combined total of around $15-16, and not what I paid for. Been there and done that; never again as it's not worth my money or effort.<//Review>

First time trying this place after passing by so many times. I informed them that it was my first visit and was then given the menu and what they recommend to first time customers. Got the Gyro Plate for a little over $14. Extremely filling, the meat cooked well, the salad was fresh, the hummus was delicious, making the overall dish a wonderful experience. Gotta try the burgers next time.<//review>

<name>Lawdan Trafford< /name><Review>Full disclosure, I’ve already eaten here 3 times in one week since I discovered this spot.

Absolutely delicious, crispy and flavorful falafel! They either put all spice or cinnamon in the seasoning which I’ve never had before and it makes the falafel so much better! Their pita bread is fluffy and thick and they add all the best toppings to their wraps; cabbage, pickles, cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes and sauces.

My friend ordered a loaded burger and my husband ordered the gyro. They both said their food was great and such generous portions they gave them.

Lucky me, they opened this location right across the street from my office. I hope they do very well and continue to have business during these difficult times. Their food is amazing.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Text>I tried their combo platter and bacon burger. They sure know how to cook a burger the tomato's were moist and ripe, the lettuce was crisp and not one bite was missing sauce or bacon or cheese. The combo platter was also rich in flavor... better than my mother's cooking</Text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><date>1594626942767< /date><Text>I can't put into words how excited I am to finally have a legit Halal (certified) American burger/diner food option, here in the Concord area.

Prior to this place opening; For years, we had to travel to places like Mirchi's in Dublin, Falafel Corner in Fremont, or Q's Halal Chicken in Alameda/Richmond.

I had always hoped that a place that offered high-quality, restaurant-oriented, American/Afghan fusion-food would come to Concord, but I wasn't sure if/when, it would happen.

This place has some of the best halal cheeseburgers I've ever tasted, and is definitely on-par  (the same standard of amazing quality) that is found in Fremont, Dublin, and all the other places in the South Bay.

Extremely delectable bacon & beef patties, smothered with American cheese, a toasted bun, and all the right sauces. Their Chicken Quesadilla & Philly Gyro, are made with succulent & tender halal meat.

There is another Falafel Flame location in Dublin, which too is also amazing, but this place is identical in its superb quality & ingredients, but so much closer to residents of Concord/Walnut Creek.

My favorites definitely have to be the Hawaiian Burger, BBQ Chicken Wings, Philly Gyro Wrap, Curly Fries, and Chicken Quesadilla.

I hope this location can start offering halal pizza in the near future, as well.

Now all we need is a Halal Chinese/Halal Mexican restaurant in Concord, and we will be on-par with our fellow kindred in Fremont & the South Bay Area.<//Text><Name>David A.<//Name><GmapID>0x8085674761c9c8f7:0xaea82a13ccf2920e<//GmapID><resp>None< /resp>< pics>

This BevMo! is conveniently located in Pinole right off the freeway and tucked in between TJ Maxx and Ulta. Lots of stores nearby to choose from. Great selection, prices, and the staff are always very helpful and ready to assist.<//Text>

< Review>
Long time card-carrying member. Went to make a purchase, but they were only handing out online and phone orders. With no one around me, I started placing an online order when someone came out and barked that I couldn’t stand there, had to get back in my car to place the order. No signs stating such, and if I had an order to pick up, it’s fine if I stand there. It’s not the rule that’s annoying, it’s being barked at like a 4th grader who broke a clearly defined rule. I’ll not be back to that store.< /Review>

When looking for mixers or any liqueurs outside the norm this is the place to go. It's a bit difficult to reach as it's tucked way in the back of a shopping center. The prices were pretty high and anything you can get at a supermarket should be avoided here. For instance cranberry cocktail is $6 at bevmo instead of $3 as typically found at Safeway.<//text>

This BevMo is always clean and neat. Very helpful cashiers and a wide variety of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. One item I bought here was $3 less than my go-to grocer. Without the BevMo member discount,  it was still less.</review>

I needed 2 bottles of Martinelli's Sparkling Cider. I went to BevMo to avoid long supermarket lines....SUCCESS 😆.

Great parking, helpful clerks, good Martinelli  selection, & clean bathrooms. Excellent store choice by me 👌.< /Text>

<Text>If you need alcohol go to bevmo to skip liquor store prices. They sometimes have a wine sale that buy one get one bottle for 5 dollars. Celebrities like to have bevmo endorse  their alcohol product lines. I met e40 there once and my bf met 50 cent at another location.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Great food, great service, prices were a little high. The menu is verried enough all will be happy. My wife enjoyed the many salad options. I'm fond of their burger, fries, and Coke. My daughter had the soup and was quite pleased. My son and granddaughter shared something and the portion was big enough to satisfy both of them.< /review>

This place is great! The food and the service is always great. Everyone who works here is really friendly, my order is always correct, and my kids love coming here because they have an area with toys, coloring books, all other activities that they can do while we wait for our food. Going to restaurants is hard with little kids, my kids are not patient so having more then a couple of piece of paper they can draw on and get bored with after two minutes is great. I also think the price is good. They have some of the best sausage too.</Review>

< Review>
Any breakfast place that has biscuits and Gravy on their menu would automatically be a 4-star experience for me. Granted, Big Daddy's definitely serving up some good grub. Having lived in Sonoma County for practically all my life I've been around the block a time or two and when it comes to breakfast this diner is holding steady.

The breakfast here is superb and you can't go wrong with simple items such as pancakes, eggs, potatoes, and a variety of bread slices. The burrito is a pleasant surprise and as I raved before their sausage gravy is pretty darn good. I've never had dinner at this establishment but there lunch seems to hold it's own as well.

Big daddy... I'll be back.</Review>

Big Daddy's Diner is a wonderful neighborhood diner. Food is very good and so is the service. You can also sit outside when it's nice. I enjoy having a neighborhood diner where I can get good food when I want.</text>

Food was bland. Corned beef hash had no salt and potatoes were not cooked. Hollandaise tasted like butter, nothing else. Home fries were okay, but on my last bite, I bit down on something hard. Upon examining the object I hit down on, I discovered it to be a piece of hard black plastic. There were several other pieces in the bite I spit out. My tooth is still hurting. I let the waitress know and she  came back, said nothing, and left the revised check. We paid in full for the meal and tipped despite the generosity. I let the other waitress know that we were not trying to get out of paying for the meal, that we were concerned that there may be something that got into the food. She claimed that it was probably pepper. I told her that I tasted it and assured her that it was NOT pepper. It was hard plastic or other material that was not food. I gave them two samples of broken scrap that I pulled from my mouth, not that I wanted them to touch them, but maybe they can identify what it was. They just didn't care. Never going back.<//review>

<review>I enjoy a dive diner every once in a while, having eaten here once before, I thought I'd try it again, I know realize why I haven't been back in ages. Sadly, this place is more dilapidated and filthy than was acceptable. The outside tables have paint chipping off of them, the service was incredibly slow considering 90% of the tables were empty and those with patrons were already served. The food was bland, however the oil used tasted stale and old. While the eggs were prepared appropriately, they were heavily salted, the ham was the consistency of rubber, the hashbrowns had that stale old oil flavor, but more than anything the place feels as if it hasn't been cleaned in over a decade, the place is beat up, and it shows. The bathrooms were covered in grime, the floors were covered in grime. I can't believe the Health Department doesn't shut this place down. There are far better places to eat in Sonoma County, how this one stays open is beyond me.</review>< pictures>

<review>Food is always delicious, good service, and they even have a small book/toy section to help entertain the kiddos. Highly recommend breakfast, but dinner is 'on point,' too. We stop by Big Daddy's everytime we come to town.<//review>< Pics>

Food was good, the service was excellent so I didn't mind paying what I felt was a little more than a typical restaurant for breakfast.  The burger was priced well.  Overall we'll be back!< /review>

<Review>Food can be good, sometimes the specials are the way to go. But don't waste your money on the coffee....super bland, tasteless brown water. Mentioned to the wait staff that it'd be nice to have a dark roast, she said "not everyone likes dark roast."  Well, hell there's the delima.....<//Review>< response>

<Text>One of my favorite spots in Rohnert Park. The food is home cooking at its best, there's plenty of it, and the prices are very reasonable. I love taking out-of-town guests there for breakfast, as it gives them a positive sense of Sonoma County living and the neighborhood. Great outdoor seating area during good weather. Can't beat it!< /Text><name>Dorene Mahoney< /name>< user>

Breakfast is always tasty (though Sunday you might have to wait a few to get a seat, it's hoppin'), they make everything just the way you like it and have a good variety of vegetarian options too.

Food is good, seems a little pricey, service is good. Really appreciated all the stuff for the kids to do while waiting for our food to come.<//text>

Hardly go there anymore because it seems they're always closed when I get the idea to go with a friend...  The food was great here the couple of times I did get in.< /review>

They also know how to prepare it correctly and to make sure that the customers are helped when they require it without even having to ask for it. Excellent service.< /text>< Rating>

It's looks much nicer on the inside than it does on the outside. All in all in is a really great gosh lounge. Seems like good prices and there is no shortage of help from the staff. We were able to spend a full two hours on one hookah.<//Text>

It used to be a great hookah joint which I visited regularly, but recently they started recycling the water in the hookah without providing new and clean water in the case before every use. Also, Whoever is filing up the tobacco bowl is now messing up  on flavors.
They need to get their act together and correct these mistakes especially stop recycling vase
water or they risk making a lot of people sick. This is a serious health risk!!!<//text>

They are always checking up on you and asking you how everything is going. Also , they don't use old hoses!eww... They have new plastick once that are cute different colors each time I go in. If I could give red room 100 starts I would.< /review>< userid>

I frequented many lounges in bay area over the years, redroom is by far the best lounge I have ever came across. The atmosphere is very welcoming and the staff are some of the best that I've had the pleasure of being served by.< /text>

< Review>
Red Room Hookah Lounge in San Jose CA is just awesome! This hookah bar has everything you need for a good hookah session. You can smoke your lungs out from top of the line egyptian hookahs that come with a StarBuzz Hose. They have all types of cold and hot drinks and plenty of tv's to watch your favorite sports events.
Check out this upscale hookah lounge and bring your friends.<//Review>

The lavoo pipe with Tangiers Shisha was in my opinion the best combo of smoothness and high buzz .  Tangiers definitely has more nicotine and bang than the other brands they have on the menu.  I liked the Summer solstice in particular.   Combine that with a Red Bull and you are flying in heaven.  The host is also very attentive and nice.  Couches are comfortable.  Music and ambience good.  Plenty of parking in front too.<//text>

<Review>Went in to have my phone repaired. Took all of 15 mins and my phone was fixed. I've been to 3 other stores and on the phone for hours with Tech Support with no luck. He fixed it in no time. I ended up buying a mom a phone as a Mother's Day gift. He gave me a really good deal. I will definitely comeback and patronize his store . Parking can be a bit of a headache depending on the time you come.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNryo-nj0CjMO10Bhne5hNP8SaReQaCxMn2I_wv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

worst store of all time all they want to do is take your money. i walked in and got completly ignored for 5 minutes untill they found out that i wanted a phone. Im never going back to this store rather walk couple blocks away to the other store on seminary where services is way better.<//Review>

<text>This company was great! They were very responsive. We already had an inspection report but they came out anyway to do their own free inspection to make sure they agreed with the report (Better than  some other companies who just read the report and gave a quote). Super easy to schedule and very fair in price range (we got about 6 different quotes). They even gave some great advice about wood burning versus ceramic logs since they saw we were expecting a new baby in the house. I highly highly recommend them!<//text>< pictures>

Wonderful team. I was searching for a licensed chimney company that offered inspections for a home I'm looking into purchasing. They were super responsive, answered all my questions and their technician was very knowledgeable and professional. They also have licensed contractors to build chimneys. Their prices are very reasonable and I know I'll be getting quality work if I needed future work on my chimneys.< /Review>

Was contacted same day, scheduled the inspection for the following day. Quote for cleaning and repairs was very reasonable (half the price of what our general inspector quoted us) AND they completed the work on the spot, no follow up needed. I'm blown away by how great the experience was, with exceptional service throughout the scheduling and actual work being done. Would definitely recommend Eco Grizzly!<//Review>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Many things for Tony and Eco Grizzly for going out of his way in fixing our dryer vent. We live in a 1930 raised foundation house were the dryer duct goes under the house. Our dryer didn’t dry our clothes and I thought it was clogged. Tony went under the thigh space and he discovered that there is only one small pieces and everything was just going under the foundation. Tony didn’t hesitate and with the help of Jonny they started cleaning up underneath the wreaths foundation as it is a fire hazard. They installed a new duct and made sure everything is working. I had a couple of companies come out here and they didn’t want to crawl under. Big thanks for Eco Grizzly, Tony and Johnny for a hard day of work that ended up perfect!<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMogLg-HhPkHMkSvrgfMgmMqWXMwgsqr--SVB8q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkwVAUFpmjMeW7CsymNl_QYrLBBVZPhFo6T7-5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdj3e8l39MGYYrxsepY50Z8JOVNTk0PjtOgwQD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCbnNBxA6HQxzhPktrQQjf1a_sC5p15CmPQFj7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMteokBRdrJUik3IYduuyNTNA3tVaH1hOyhTkyp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHrYfYMcOSMj76Q5_ygSpPJ6EilI6HE24W2Qcx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFUnfYi9uk79ydcpym75R5GknwO19lmV4ROIX1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNifyen-PO76T9V33s6-NloOD9ksAZDyC0UzSz8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-oEYIXQttLBDA4XMOVlwfGt5Jiu7wYk4S4K9g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtanFOoRzBaZAAhQejWHI2BieDm58nM7GdLLtb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrus99McfqXq1DgIPKBJnL2z6koGsgdWadowYf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP980BF8RwnN-cFWpArs4PNllURunxcPmkFSySG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

<text>A few weekend ago when it was cold we decided to light up the fireplace after a long time we haven’t used it, after lighting the fire smoke started to go inside the house instead of going up the chimney, the next morning I called and Maureen picked up the phone, she was very informative and understanding, making the effort to send one of the technician to our house the same day. Johnny came and inspected the chimney, our crown was broken and we had no cap and a extremely dirty chimney as we have never cleaned it. He explained every little Detail of what has to be done, made sure we are happy with it, and started to work. The result was great! We are very happy and the chimney and fireplace are working perfectly! Highly recommended to anyone who hasn’t cleaned the chimney!! It’s very important!< /text>< pics>

Great Service from the Office who set up the appointment, and the sms confirmation, to the Text from the technician that was on his way. Din came and performed a thorough inspection, explain everything that came up from the Inspection. We decided to go a head and preform part of the work. Din kept everything clean and neat as it was when he walked in, kept his mask and kept social the entire time. Highly recommended professionals. Will you other services they offer in the future.<//text>

Great service and very responsive! I called for a consultation after having another company inspect my chimney and giving me a super high price for repairs. To me personally didn’t sound like it’s a major repair but since I am not a professional I wanted to get a second opinion. I found Eco Grizzly and based on the customers reviews I decided to contact. The lady over the phone, Lina, was very nice and patient. She took the time to explain to me the process and the terms in whoch I had no idea. Then she was able to book me same day for an inspection which I was very grateful for because the rain was coming and I was aftaid of leaking into my home. The technician Tony came out later that day right on time. He inspected my chimney and reviewed the other report I had. His quote for the same scope of work was 3rd of the cost the first company offered!!! He explained to me the work he was going to do and did it all the same day! I used my fireplace the next night and since then every night- everything works perfect! They even called to ask me how the service was! I am definitely going to recommend my family and friends! Best service I have received in many many years!<//review>

I want to share my experience with eco grizzly. As a service business owner my self in the HVAC industry I’m always skeptical about other service guys coming to my house and working. I have a old chimney that I needed work on. Johnny, who is the supervisor for eco grizzly came out and preformed a inspection, he was thorough, inspected every component of the chimney system and provided me a detailed report. We sat down and Johnny explained everything that popped up in his inspection. Told me what was the solution for every point of the inspection. Highly knowledgeable, knows every little detail and code. We agreed on the scope of work (new flue liner installation) to get the chimney up to code and to be safe to operate. When they came out to preform the work, Johnny and his crew came early in the morning, set up moving blankets to lay all the equipment and rolled paper to cover every area that can be effected from the work. Demolition was clean and fast, preparation for the flue liner installation, and the installation was very professional and safe, they used safety harness on the roof. Nothing but great works to say about Eco grizzly, Johnny and the crew. After work was finished they cleaned up everything and followed up a few days later to check that everything cured properly. Will recommend them to everyone in need of chimney service or any other service they provide, honest, great communication and A+ on workmanship.< /Text>

We needed to have our fireplace worked on to stop the cold air from coming into our home.  I sent an email to Eco Grizzly and they called me within an hour.  Rather than quoting me to come out and fix, they walked me through the process which was easy, and I was able to take care of it myself.  So grateful for a nice company.  Excellent customer service, would recommend them for sure.< /review>

<text>The company went above and beyond on our chimney sweep. As we had recently closed on our condo, we noticed that soot was constantly falling from our closed wood burning fireplace, which also caused a lot of smoke smell in our house. Upon their inspection, we discovered it hadn't been cleaned in almost to 15 years! I'm so glad we went with Eco Grizzly. I truly believe you pay for what you get and we definitely did. They not only thoroughly cleaned the chimney, but unlike other chimney sweeps, they also leave the fireplace area spotless. They follow all the covid-19 procedure codes to keep us safe. We highly recommend this company. Don't be fooled by cheaper chimney sweeper's, go for the pros.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend working with Eco Grizzly. They called back within a couple of minutes after I reach them and the appointment was quickly scheduled. They were on time and following all the COVID-19 recommendations. The work was completed to full satisfaction. There are a lot of companies in this city, and as a result it is hard to get anyone to commit to a job and then follow up with solid work. I would definitely recommend giving them at least an opportunity to provide you an estimate for your work. I think you will be surprised how different these guys really are. Will work with them again in the future.</Review>< userid>

ZERO STARS--but they won't post this without stars. This was for chimney sweeping--not just an estimate.

I consider this a scam. He came in the door saying he had his equipment and was ready to do the job. He told me of problems(that could result  in issues)that would cost over $4,000 to address, upselling me right away.

When he found out I was not interested in it and only wanted cleaning, he said he would not be able to do it and someone would come tomorrow. I canceled at that point.
He was only a Salesman and did not answer questions. Several times he repeated don't worry about it(like when I asked what an inspection entailed) and  I don't want you to waste your money( just getting a cleaning when you need more and may have a problem in the future if you don't do these things).
He drove away without taking his ladder which was right next to the front door. I think this shows he was a Salesman in a hurry to go to the next person and not used to having equipment to take with him. What workman would leave a ladder?
He was in his van driving away when he must have seen the ladder as he looked at the house because he backed up and came and got it.
I did report this to to a woman who said she was a supervisor. I used the phone number I made the appointment with.
Price-wise, the estimate for what I wanted was $250 for deep cleaning but a separate $299 for the smoke shelf.< /Review>

Eco Grizzly was very helpful in providing a reasonable quote and not upselling or overcharging me for unecessary services. I knew what I wanted and I got just that without pushy add ons.

Deep clean return (main), deep clean ducts with roto brush tool, and system disinfection afterwards. Dryer vent also got a deep cleaning.

I recommend this place for quality and knowledgeable, honest service.  I will hire again.<//Text>

The technician, Tony, was great. He arrived when scheduled after giving me a heads up phone call that he was on his way. He kept me informed and showed me videos and photos of every step. He even vacuumed behind the washer and dryer and cleaned the back of the machines. I will call again next year.<//Review>

Ron, did great job. I had another company give me a quote and they were much higher and much more work.
I asked Ron of the work they quoted was off. He reviewed it and explained in detail the only things required tio her our fireplace back in order.
Ron was very efficient and informative.

I recommend this company.< /Review>

<Review>These guys are phenomenal. What a smoothly run operation from start to finish! Let me tell you from A to Z why you should go with Eco Grizzly:
I submitted my quote request through Yelp; they were the first to respond and had the most competitive price. Maureen contacted me by phone with the details of the service, was incredibly pleasant and patient answering my questions and then was able to get me scheduled right away. She contacted me prior to my service to confirm and let me know that they may be running early if that was ok, which it was - great communication! Eli, the technician then texted me that he was on his way, again a much appreciated update along the way. Eli and Dean showed up right on time. They are two of the most friendly, patient, knowledgeable people you could hope to encounter when having work done on your house. They seemed genuinely enthusiastic about the job, educating me, and explaining everything. They got right to work, were incredibly efficient and then let me know what they found in their inspection. They gave me a very fair price on the additional chimney repairs to be done and since they had already demonstrated great service, I had no reason not to go ahead with the additional work. They took care of everything right on the spot, left the place looking spotless. Eli made sure to take before and after pictures of everything along the way and took the time to go over everything, never leaving me to wonder if the work was really being completed. They went out of their way to even help me out with an unrelated job while they were waiting for some of the repairs to dry. Truly an A+ team and an all around great customer service experience!</Review>< UserId.>

<review>My wife and I got a 90 min couples massage. They did a good mixture of deep tissue and basic oil massage. The woman massaging me did a great job at finding my trouble spots and she didn't ease up, which I like.

Overall it was very relaxing and my wife enjoyed it as well. They do expect a decent tip though when you leave.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>2<//rating><review>Great Service, people are nice. Only thing is, even though they advertise that they can do Deep Tissue massages they simply rub you for 50 minutes with oil then 10 minutes they will do some tissue massaging that can be rated at like mid-grade pressure, definitely far from Deep Tissue. As an athlete it's a great disappointment because the Deep Tissue massage is what I paid for and expected, working out you need the muscles to be healthy in order to progress. Twice I went with the same results, a fake deep tissue massage. If you like real deep tissue then simply don't go.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
My husband and I got a couple deluxe spa package and we we're very satisfied with our massages! The massages and body scrub made us leave feeling really light and relaxed and our skin supple. The package includes a 30 min facial as well which was pretty good but left a little more to be desired as our blackheads weren't removed properly and the facial and mask was just our face. Overall we were happy and will surely be returning because it was also pretty affordable.</Review>

Cons:
1)They ASKED FOR A TIP
2) When she started extracting my skin, instead of using a comedone extractor tool, she was extracting my white and black heads with her nails. (she was wearing gloves) We were already 5 mins into extractions when she finally went and got the tool.
3) Because she was using her nails to extract my skin, it was EXTREMELY PAINFUL
4) I paid $70 for the facial, but they did not provide high frequency treatment or LED light treatment. So the technology was definitely not advanced. I've gotten a facials in the past that costed around the same price that did include these treatments.
5) Other employees kept walking in and out of the room, so it wasn't very relaxing
6) There was a huge language barrier. They didn't understand a word that I was saying. I asked the lady what products she is using on my face and she went and got someone else. Who also didn't understand what I was saying. So, I'm not even sure what they were using on my face.

Pros:
1) It was a clean area
2) They are nice people
3) She wore gloves throughout the process

Overall, it was the most painful facial I have ever had and I would probably never go back again. I didn't plan on writing the review after the facial. I was just gonna leave it alone and go on with my life. But the fact that they ASKED FOR A TIP AFTER! Just threw me off the edge. Like come on, you were extracting my skin with your claws.< /Text>< user>

<Text>Excellent hot stone massage. Best I ever had. Coco was the massuse. All stiff muscles gone. Loved the thicker sheet. Only drawback was male voices from adjoining alcove when his session was finished, too loud.  Soothing music. Ambiance not much. But your eyes are closed 90% of the time. Will return.

<Review>Worst body massage I ever had,  masseuse was pretty hard on back, i kept on saying pressure is too hard, but she was reluctant to understand anything, instead of feeling relaxed my body is in pain.  Foot massage was still better than body massage. Not even in my worst nightmare i'll go back to this place</Review></record></dataset><record>

I do wish they would consider improving the shower i.e. replacing the shower curtain or improving the decor. But if you're in need of a affordable back rub, facial and scrub for mess than $100, the shower curtain really doesn't matter.</Review>< pictures>

One of the worst massage experiences.  The guy who did the massage for me constantly burped during the session.  I could barely feel the massage initially so I asked him to increase the force, at which point he offered to change the massage to be purely chinese massage even though we paid for oil massage.  Oh and guess what.  He went through the rest of the massage without increasing the force and I left the place feeling worse than before entering.</Text>

They are pretty good.They can do better in service and consistency of massage therapists.
I go to  them monthly and I am attending by a new person every time.
It is a goo deal for the price and is very refreshing.<//text>

Fremont Day Spa was great. They have mainly Chinese masseuses( heavy hand pressures) and are skilled professionals. You have to tell them to do light pressure and that's regular  light to medium pressure. Their rooms are chilly but very neat and clean. You also need to tell them what area you want to focus on in the begining of the session. Their english is not good so they might not ask you. Alisha was my masseus and she was amazing and speaks english well.</Review>

Lets say  that is the only pro I can give this place.  We got there on time, waited for someone to check us in. They were busy talking with one another in their language. Then when they did talk to us, they said you pay cash or charge. Charge is more.  We waited about 10 min and they took us back to our room.  The lady said put your clothes in the box, lay face down. Waited another 10 min for someone to walk in. My husband had a lady I had a man. No big deal.  Never once did they introduce themselves, or ask if we had any issues. Well they  were talking to one another in their language. finally they stopped talking.  The guy burped,  someone came in to the room and started talking to them.  Then the guy straddled my head when he was working on my back. Was not even close to a good massage. I couldn't wait to get out of there.</review>< Pictures>

<Response>None<//Response><rate>2< /rate><review>Dingy, unprofessional looking spot. My first impression soon as i walked in - “you call this a SPA?” I had a Groupon, so figured I’d give it a shot. They really need to clean up (esp the bathroom), redecorate the whole place & add more bright lighting. The same lady who was at the reception did my facial, both times. I didn’t see anyone else around. She did an ‘okay’ job - I wasn’t impressed, but it wasn’t bad either. 3rd visit - a different lady was at the front desk, she couldn’t find me in their system. She saw I had an appt but kept trying to find my name somewhere else. Wasted 15 mins right there.. Finally got into a room, waited another 20 before anyone even showed up. I noticed a lack of consistency in their service too, because this time they didn’t do the “extraction” part of the facial, which is standard. Since she’d made me pre-pay, plus I didn’t have any cash, I forgot to tip. So after I left, the reception lady came running after me and asked how it was. I said good but mentioned the extraction. She pretty much ignored that question, and instead stuck an envelope in front of me and said we have a tip suggestion. I couldn’t believe she literally ran after me with a cash envelope lmao...
4/10 for the service and 3/10 for the environment/ambiance/overall experience.
All in all, I would NOT recommend.</review>< Name>

<Review>I went here for the first time this afternoon and I was impressed. I have a Lee’s donuts really close to my house so I had high hopes. Wasn’t disappointed. I was greeted by a friendly woman who seemed a little stressed as there was a line starting to form. She was the only that appeared to be at the counter but she handled it well. The man before me was a little rude but she seemed to perk up when I greeted her. She was super kind and welcoming.

The donuts of course were fresh and fluffy. They had good flavor and the perfect amount of glazes. I noticed they do offer sandwiches as well in which I will be trying next! They even offer ice cream and other misc snacks.<//Review>< name>

<Review>I have been coming to Lee's donuts for so many years! I love their home made bagels, ice coffees and the customer service. It's a family owned business Kevin & wife  are always so nice. There is a lot of parking and fast service. This is a must go donut shop. 🍩<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>The lady at the donut shop was a very nice towards the customers. She has great customer service. I give this place five stars because they let you use a card with no minimum payment. They take credit and debit and cash. They have fresh breakfast every morning and open at 5 a.m. the earliest. They have a huge variety of donuts. They even have Donuts that you can fill with strawberry lemon or cream that aren't are already filled. Their cream filling is fresh. And their coffee is also fresh. This is one of the best donut places I've been to in a really long time and I don't eat donuts often and I recommend this place for people to come to.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I love this place not only because of their delicious donuts, but for their customer service. They always have a smile on their face & are very welcoming. My son loves donuts but only prefers this place bc of their bread. It doesn't taste like day old donuts! Our favorite donut shop in Hayward hands down!! 🙂<//Review><pics>None< /pics></record>

<Response>None<//Response><text>A donut shop with varies fruity and non fruit drinks with semi types of donut style and flavors. Hard to get to find once you leave foothill going southbound towards hayward, ca. It easily located next and in Walgreen Mall.
I didn't like seeing again courtesy security guards standing mostly by small business and churchs. Too quiet area; which at one time was semiactive with people and bisiness.
You will get lost do to many dead end streets and road connected to several freeways. Wouldn't want a flat tire or get loss even though it located close to downtown hayward.
Traffic is starting to go back to normal, i preferred the quiet rides and slow speed.</text><username>Karen Gums<//username></record>

Great place and easy access, for the food quality and price it's all great.

They even are able to do large orders of 20 sandwiches and a few dozens of donuts.

Ham bacon egg and cream cheese with jalepeno bagel or without jalepeno, both were most deliciis< /Review>

Really good Thai tea for only $2.75, which is way less than overpriced tea places like Eko, and the staff are really friendly</text>

Manager or owner is not a friendly guy. He gives me dirty looks. Not a great way to treat a new person who just moved here..
But employees are very nice and treat me good
Its that owner.!!!!< /review>

<Review>I loveeeeee Kevin's bagels!!! My favorite are the jalapeño & blueberry with cream cheese (& sometimes egg). He makes them everyday fresh and when you get them in your hands they are nice and toasty. The coffee is great too, i love the vanilla & iced coffee. Go and try it out, you (probably) won't regret it, hehe.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I purchased my used van from here and use the service department for the major work on my van. I absolutely am satisfied with the department. Mitch R. Is the service rep. And he is fantastic. He works with you, gives the information and let's you choose. He doesn't push any which way. If you have Nissan and need work done come here, you will be taken care of.<//text>

This is a very pleasant place to take a vehicle. The staff seems very knowledgeable and they give you a tour of the place so you know where everything is while you wait. Afterward, you get a free car wash at the place next door. This was my first service call for my vehicle and everything went great!<//Review>

<Review>If I could I would give this place a big fat "0". I have never been so mistreated.

I was helping my son by a car. So we decided to start at Jim Bone Nissan.

We were met in the parking by a nice salesman.  After I explained our situation and my son  didn't see any he liked. I informed the salesman that we were done. The salesman passed us off to his sale manager.

I once again explained our situation and the sales manager recommended we finance the vehicle we were looking for.  The sales manager showed us a used BMW with tons of miles.

Once I told the sales manager that we weren't interested in the car and I was definitely not interested in financing he became upset.  He's  hollow demeanor change and become upset.

I extend my hand to shake his but he refused.

I have only seen little kids throw fits like that.

It sucks because I am trying to show my son how to be a proper man and the sales manager showed my son that it's ok to act like a child any if you you are 50.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x8084481c4101c3d5:0x85e62416007b02fc<//gmap_id></record>

Seems like they want to sell you a used car even when you tell them you want a new one. Truck that I wanted was packed in so tight it as if it was not for sale.< /review>

We always take our Kia Optima to get serviced at Jim Bone.  The inside is nice and the sales associates aren't pushy.  They offer to double the warranty on their sales to a 200,000 mile/10 year which is amazing.  If I purchase Kia again(likely), I'll buy it here.</review>

Scheduled an appointment for an oil change and arrived 15 minutes early only to be told that there would be a 2 hour wait. What is the point of scheduling an appointment if you are just going to make me wait anyways.</text>

Great 80s club! Parking is pretty much street only so I suggest parking in the neighborhood. Usually good eclectic mix of genres. Occasional live band. Karaoke opposite side of dance floor</Text>

OMG - This place rocks.  Parking can be daunting, so plan accordingly.  Great Drinks & really good Food.  There are 2 rooms, one where the band plays, or the DJ dance floor, bar, tables . . .   The 2nd room - dance floor, tables and chairs.  Great Bar, good security, so play nicely please.  Go it alone or with friends and enjoy.</text>

Finally got to visit this awesome place on Friday May 18, 2018, at 830PM.

It was a friend's birthday and I'd seen how often she partied here, so I had to check it out.

The corner location makes it easy to find, with ample street parking (as their lot is pretty small). Luckily I had no issues finding a spot right at front entrance.
Arrive early to get a good & safe spot.

Bouncers outside and inside. 21+.
That night was $10 cover, CASH.
(tho I'm told this is the norm)

A dance room with Dj & Live bands.
And a karaoke room with Dj too. It's a great ambiance overall, very relaxed.

Plenty food choices & decent prices
(See menu pics). I picked the jalapeno poppers, cheese sticks, and steak fries, all were delish! Plastic accepted.

Waiters were friendly & attentive,
tho a bit pushy to get you to buy more.
I say this bc due to cover charge,  there aren't drink minimums.

Karaoke Dj was good, he jammed out
to a few songs, a bit picky about
PEOPLE SINGING W DRINK IN HAND.
(He takes a photo of EVERY singer).

Mostly 80s songs, divey, fun crowd...
Starts slow,  but does fill up!!

Enjoy the photos. Like the review.

<rating>4</rating><Text>Came on a night with a tribute band and karaoke and boy, was it busy (and loud)! Cash-only cover charge.

Karaoke room was really supportive of everyone who went up and sang along for crowd favorites. Mics worked pretty well and there TONS of lyrics screens so you can look around the room more.

Major complaint is they won't serve you a glass of water, even if you order a drink. Seriously management?? Take care of your customers! I need at least one glass of water per alcoholic drink, so if you can't give me some free tap water, i just won't buy drinks.

Drinks and food were pretty decent. Fast drink service despite the crush.

An excessively drunk guy kept making a scene and getting in people's space and i wish security would have done something, but he wasn't belligerent --- just overly party-happy.

Would probably come back, maybe on a quieter night.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>This place was so much fun! Its not as small as some people reviewed. Or at least i didn't think so. Everyone was dancing and having a great time. Lots of security so i felt pretty safe and loved the decor of the place! Can't wait to go back. Oh and their food was amazing! Great prices on everything! (I highly recommend the Madonna drink)< /Review><resp>None</resp>< Pics>

<Review>This is a fun spot. Of the chain of 80''s bars, this one is my favorite. It's small, and more of a dive which is what I prefer. Drinks are always good, spendy but good. Appetizers are tasty and karaoke is always awesome. Parking is bad. Expect to walk some distance if you visit on a Saturday night or a night when a popular band is playing. Cover bands are mostly all pretty good. There is a cover of $10 per head, cash only. They do have an atm. Norms across the street is a big plus!< /Review>< response>

<text>Best karaoke bar on earth (not hyperbole). If you're into obscure, and underground music from decades past, chances are they have it. The bar, and restaurant staff, and bouncers are friendly, and helpful. Lots of great food choices (no vegan), and drink specials nightly.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dd32c234c6e6ff:0x524691d1f670b8cc</Gmap_id><response>None</response>< time>

Better than Anarchy Library minus the $10 door charge. 80's all the way, scaryokee in one room,  bar and dance floor in another, a few people with staring problems but when you dance like no one's watching © there's bound to be eyes taking notice especially from people who aren't even dancing. Didn't order anything, we pre-gamed in the truck. Didn't check prices or rad drink names, DJ was what I could only imagine as an 80's club DJ. It's hard to give a bad review when you have a great time anywhere. Probably will return. 👍👍👍< /Review>

<Review>My first experience at this place was for a birthday party in the karaoke room. I have to the same it was a fun and entertaining experience. The staff is friendly and very helpful. Definitely have to come back to experience what else this place has to offer. Big plus for having the Michael Jackson painted door.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Fun and freaky blast from the past venue, featuring authentic,  live bands from the 80's and  DJ's spinning music and videos of our favorites from this era. We were there when "Flock of Seagulls" were performing. Serving vibrant drinks named after songs, like "Pretty In Pink" and "Purple Rain". Food smelled good, but I didn't eat there. They served your typical American style comfort food, like burgers and chicken wings, ordered from a comic book designed menu. Fun place to take you back in a time machine.< /review><gmapID>0x80dd32c234c6e6ff:0x524691d1f670b8cc< /gmapID><Rate>5</Rate>< Date>

<review>Great experience. If you enjoy 80s music this is the place for you. Friendly staff and the DJ took requests all night. Prices are reasonable as well. The only downside is the parking. It might take you a while to find a spot and it also might be a little ways away but you will find one. I will be attending this place regularly with friends.<//review><Time>1532310242298< /Time>< Rate>

Best Birthday ever! Free shot on your birthday. Everyone was so nice here. DJ played best 80s songs and what a mix. Billy Idol tribute band was so good! The crowd was nice and such a good vibe here! You have to come! Norms across the street so people go there after so it makes for fun night. Karokee too but everyone is singing on the dance floor and so happy.<//review>

<Text>I've been here a few times now. If you like 80's vibes, music and/or just a change in your typical routine, this is the place. Awesome time and great atmosphere. Nice people, strong drinks and a full (but not crammed) dance floor of people always getting down.<//Text>< Time>

<text>I enjoyed the live band. I also enjoyed all the beautiful people for hooking up. But the waitress were very slow.. I enjoyed that it's popular and it gets over crowded.. but truly it gets extremely hot.. it felt like no air conditioning was but it was.. out of everything the music was wonderful and the environment was great everyone had a wonderful time... thank you very much..<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Rating>

<Review>Great food and entertainment with a fun 80s theme throughout. Combines music videos with a DJ spinning all 80s tunes together with live 80s tribute bands.

Went for the first time last night. First time to a place like this. It was great. Food was great, service was great, and the 80s music was lit. They didn't discriminate, from WHAM to George Michaels to Prince and Bobby Brown. They had it all! Definitely will go back again!!!<//Review>

I had the best time at this 80's themed bar! Karaoke was a blast, and being from out of town, the staff and patrons were the friendliest, most fun group of people I've met since being in L.A.!! Highly recommend going on Tuesday for the tacos and tunes!< /Text>

<Text>One of the greatest bars to go check out in the L.A. county area. 80s music is great and awesome karaoke. Friendly bartenders and the best owners and managers. I recommend people to come here for drinks and food, the weekend is great but their specials during the week can't be beat, especially $3 dollar any bottle of beer on Wednesday.</Text>< rating>

At first glance. It looks like your typical dive bar.  That in itself can either be intimidating or off putting to some. I personally find this place to be more like a hidden gem. The experience here varies on the times you go. I enjoy going after work with friends sitting at the bar and having a few drinks. The place offers Karaoke for those who love to swoon. They have bands that come through some times and also offer dancing on certain days. What I mostly enjoy about this place is the food. You would never suspect the food is any good here but I promise you their food cannot be missed. Order their burgers and you will taste or smell nothing better. A burger that smells better with every bite taken is a riddle to me but one that I enjoy every time I go. Also their wing appetizers are amazingly good and sharable. The staff are all amazing, friendly and helpful. This is definitely a place I recommend to people.</text>

<review>I remember when this place opened. It was a bar for an older crowd who loves 80s, but more pop 80s. However recently this place has turned into a mashup with corny rock en español. I dont get it. Mostly younger crowds now. And so packed theres no place to stand.< /review>< pics>

COOL SPOT PARKING SUCKS...
ALWAYS HARD TO FIND PARKING...
BUT A FUN PLACE...
JUST DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE...
CAPS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AROUND FOR DRUNK DRIVERS SO BE SAFE HAVE A RIDE IF YOU WANT TO DRINK...

Kinda divey. Days their a restaurant, but I went late for karaoke and not alot of people were eating.  Our server required us to buy bottled water rather than offering us tap water.  The mixed drinks we ordered we're basic, not their specialty drinks, and were made terribly.  I ended up drinking straight shots of tequila. They had a good beer special, but none of us drink beer much. The karaoke was fun, the people we're fun.  Their sound system wasn't the best, but if you like singing 80's, especially more obscure 80's, you'll have fun.<//Text>

<review>My wife and I are children of the 80s, so this place is pretty cool. Theming is pretty good but with a few more touches could be great. They have live music in one room and karaoke in another. We've been twice and will be back.<//review></record>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>Went here with a group of friends on a Friday night. Overall we had a great time. We spent most of the time in the Karaoke room. It was really fun although I'm not a great singer everyone was pump and no judgment. Drinks were ok so I switched over go beer. We missed the band since we were having a great time listening to others sing. There is a cover charge of $10. The place was pretty packed with mostly a younger crow. After the band stops they have a D.J. playing some remix between 80s and something else. It was ok but not my thing.  I would definitely consider coming here again and listening to the band this time.</review>< pics>

<Text>Awesome 80s atmosphere. They have a dining room, karaoke, bar, a stage, and a dance floor. The music is awesome as well as the 80s themed interior (neon, posters, drawings).</Text></record>

All my favorite bands from the 80's that I didn't get to see, I can see at New Wave bar. From the Flock of Seagulls to Missing Persons, I have gotten to see up close the bands I missed so long ago. It continually thrills me that they can get these big names to come to a bar. I can see and hear them up close and personal. Some of the instruments they used in the 80's I was unsure of, but when they play at New Wave bar, I can see the instruments they used. The most surprising was Flock of Seagulls which I was certain they used instruments that maybe I have never seen, but the talent they display with a synthesizer and two guitars and a drummer just still blow me away. Thank you New Wave bar. PS. you can meet the band usually right outside the door and lavish your praises on a personal level.< /Review>

<text>Pricey Cover Charge but it keeps the Riff away so you and your friends can enjoy some really great 80's Retro Music and Dancing.  The 80's theme named Bar Concoctions are sure to loosen up the toungue as you re-live your past life as a rock star at the Ultra Hip Karaoke Bar and plus they have a really tasty food menu selection to take care of those midnight munchies.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Wednesday night's $3 beers were good can't complain. Although anything other than that you're really just asking for a good bowel cleaning the next morning. The fishbowls sucked and mixed drinks were watered down. Really was not expecting to pay for Kool-Aid with a little bit of alcohol. Not very economical if you're trying to get drunk. Don't expect to see me in there unless they limit how much water they put in the drinks.</text>

I always meet my friend John here on Monday nights. They open the doors at 8 so dont try to arrive early. We always have a lot of fun here at Monday Karaoke. We get to sing a lot because it is pretty empty when we first get there. Sometimesi get more friends to come out and meet us there. Any way come ondown for Karaoke they have it Mon to Wed at least in the main big room. The other nights it will be in a small back room I would not want to go to karaokein that back room. Enjoy!!</Text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>Best place if you want to get some good 80's music, although it tends to get too crowded on the weekends to the point that is is uncomfortable and stuffy. Beside that is is a good time and on the weekdays they have great drink specials. I liked that the last time I went they were actually serving a IPA beer.<//Review>< Pics>

Came for the music but  couldn't really hear as there were two venues in one building separated only by a wall and a wide door that was left open. It was just two noise sources competing with each other's.<//Text>

Good place to go to dance sometimes the DJ sucks, good prices on beer not enough tables if you come late you are going to stand up for the rest of the night at least 3 to 4 hours.< /Text>

The atmosphere was great, the food was traditional bar food and they had a great song selection. This was a great dive seedy bar type true to the name. My only complaint was that the line for the songs were long but I suppose the dj did all he could to keep everyone participating.<//text>

Came here on a Sunday for kareoke night (husband's bday). Was not packed so plenty of parking. Cool staff - door guy, kareoke host, and bartender. Didn't see micheladas on drink menu, but bartender whipped some up for a couple more bucks. $3 Coronas so I didn't mind paying extra. Kareoke selection good, but not as new-wavy as other nights. A bit too loud at first, but after a couple of drinks, seems just fine.< /Text>

Best part of this restaurant is that it is open till mid night.Live music is another good feature of this restaurant.Staff behavior and their politeness toward customer is really great.Price is quite reasonable.Normally,if there is no event than customer do not need wait to place an order.< /Review>

This place has the greatest karaoke in town, literally, all encompassing.  It is a place where you can just be who you are without judgement or reservation.  Kudos to KJ Jay T., definitely one to be patterned after.  What a friendly, welcoming environmet!  What more is there to say than a Benzo two thumbs up!<//review>

< Review>
Water is life and at the new wave they think it should cost $3 a glass. Is it legal? Yes. But it makes for bad business. When customers pay $50 a night on dehydrating liquor, sweat on the dancefloor, and sing their lungs out they deserve water.
When i called b.s. the blonde chubby bartender said he can't tell me who made the rule, but said i could talk to the manager. He pointed to a skinny hispanic in a red jump suit. He said it was legal and it was obvious theres no exceptions. I found out i spoke to security, not the manager as promised. Yet another example of the lack of care for the customers.
There are places who care. Those that don't, don't deserve buisness. Bye new wave, you're in the burn book now 🔥 📖<//Review>

<review>My friends and I came here to see Flashpants a few weeks ago and had a blast! The place had been on our radar for quite a while but it just took us a while to get it together. The cover is $5 til 8pm, $10 after, which I didn't think was too bad for going to see a band. The place is quite roomy, with 80s paraphernalia everywhere. Loved seeing all the vintage 12" LP covers of all my favorite bands. They have two main areas: the stage and dance floor, and a side dining/lounging area, which could use a little more style, but was all right. When we got there around 9pm there were plenty of tables available but they do fill up fast. We saw a person walk by with this giant glass orb drink and found out it was called "The Fish Bowl," and we knew we had to get it! It's definitely big enough to share, and bonus points for the flashing light floating around in it as well!

The band went on stage around 10pm and played for at least a couple of hours, with a short break in between. They were hilarious! I'd caught them at a free performance at a Movies on the Beach and they did not disappoint. If anything, since this was an adults-only club their antics were crazier and funnier. The crowd is on the older side, definitely playing on the mostly Gen Xers' nostalgia. A LOT of bday celebrations going on--apparently if you're over the age of 40 this is the place, lol. Anyhoo, a good time had by all, and we're looking forward to catching one of the many 80s tribute bands that come through here on a regular basis.</review>< pictures>

Very rude staff who don't know the meaning or purpose of reservations. No real security staff just a bunch of guys letting only the people they know in and then when you do finally get in its just musty and unpleasant. Smh. I was so disappointed.< /review>
