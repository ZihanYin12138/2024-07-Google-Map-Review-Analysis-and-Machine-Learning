What’s crazy is, I haven’t been in this store in at least three years and that experience traumatized me. I didn’t realize it until today, when I was going to order an Apple Watch online but saw that I could get it in the store sooner. Just the thought of going back in there, where the employees were rude and condescending, made me so upset that I started shaking. I remember contacting TMobile customer service and them saying that store complaints had to be submitted elsewhere and gave me an address. Then when multiple friends said they’d had similar experiences, it made me wonder how the same staff could have worked there more than a month without TMobile addressing the problem. Anyway, I didn’t write a review then but figured that since the experience had given me since a visceral reaction, I needed to share.< /text>

<text>Five stars just doesn't seem like enough!  Jesus and Martin were a dream team getting my family's and our business account transferred from another carrier.  It was somewhat confusing and frustrating on some things and they never once made me feel like they were being put out or like they weren't happy to help.  During the process I also dealt with Elaine and she is forever so friendly and helpful, even following up with me when I completely missed our appointment (totally my fault).  While all of the employees always have greeted me with a smile and have answered countless questions, these three were the ones that I had the pleasure of working with and they went above and beyond on every level.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>I went to another t mobile store in riverside, I wasn't able to go through the process, just run. The credit and the kid fraudulently started an act in my name and there were charges on it. This store was fantastic, they called the fraud dept. Did everything possible and the manager Jackie even called to check up on how the progress was going. Very happy, let's hope the service is as good as employees< /Review><user>104742856766355055183<//user><response>None</response>< Rating>

Well since I switch over from Att to T-Mobile Veteran’s plan I have been having issues  with billing. I walked into the store several time about being over charged on. First time I return it was because they charged me for 2 extra lines and T-Mobile plus which I didn’t not order. They told me that they were going the issue me a $40.00 credit which would’ve fix it but they didn’t

Then today I walked in the Greenspot store in Highland CA again. Bill still not fixed and also found out that my 11 year old has international calling, I wasn’t aware the she was going anywhere.  I showed the bill in hand with the charges . It showed that the mathematician didn’t add up to my plan. Which were $55, line 1, $25, line 2, and $10 every additional line, which include taxes  with auto pay addin up to $90 . So I spoke a gentleman named John, which the only reason I knew that  his is name John was because I walked back into the store after I left to ask for his card. John handed me a card with the store information but no name. I had to turn around and go back into the store to ask him his name.

The first young lady that looked at my account and understood what my concerns were and called John over. John became very stern as he walk over to explain the bill to me. I told him I understand the bill, he was telling me about taxes, which he didn’t bother looking at the bill to see that the taxes were included. John was very short to me. He being a young man and I being almost 60.

I said ok and said that I well go to another t mobile store to fix the problem. John  walked away very apathetic and started to work on a computer.

I departed and headed to the the T mobile store at Alabama and Laconia in Redlands CA, as I walked in I asked if this was a corporate store and was told yes by a young lady that immediately introduced herself as Elaine (Barajas) . l expanded what was happening and she checked my account,  did the math and saw that in fact it didn’t add up.

She then called corporate and between her, corporate, and the store manager figured all what was done wrong by the franchise store located  on Greenspot , in the City of Highland CA. and fixed it, I ported  in one more  phone numbers and added a line and left happy ever after.< /text>

I had went to T-Mobile in san Bernardino they said I can trade in my phones to get the phone I want when I was adding my second line. Got my bill and I've found out I've been overcharged on one line for a year now and now I'm being overcharged with 2 lines and trying to speak with management is hard and representatives don't help to get my bill to match what I agreed on and they say there looking into it n will call back and they never call back n now my bill is way over due and still no help screw T-Mobile they also refunded money back before to my friends card after paying the bill when her name wasn't on the account. Taken ADVANTAGE OF AND RIPPED OFF!!!< /review>

<Text>Horrible Customer Service by Justin, everytime i come in to get something fixed bcuz of an input error in there part customers fault all the time. He is there to make point not care of the needs of the cuatomer. I recommend the Corporate Store by Sams Club unless Christian or a Manager assist you avoid Justin and the headache your going have exchanging a phone that overheats Galaxy S6...< /Text>< pics>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very bad service, when you come to buy very friendly, but since you come with the problem, there is no courtesy, and the manager very arrogant and despota.

As a newbie to vinyl, I found them to be super helpful, practical, and knowledgeable. Excellent customer service and there was an adorable dog in the shop too. They have more than records. There are skateboards, books, apparel. If I hadn’t brought my kids I would have spent a lot more time browsing.

Will be back very soon!<//text>< Pictures>

Great shop, local business, excellent service.  Cory took the time to help my son pick out and build his first skateboard.  May have been able to save a few $ purchasing online, but the knowledge and experience of the employees is priceless.<//Text>

I'm so glad there is an alternative to larger record stores in the bay area. (I love them too, but just saying) This place has a great variety of new vinyl. Plus a nice selection of used records as well. My sons barber told us about this shop. (Thanks, Wes) As my son continues to grow his collection, he will learn the beauty of supporting his local record shop.<//text>

Went to a reading and it was layed out oddly - two chairs abreast, down one row, and then perpendicular.  It must have been hard for the speakers to make eye contact in two different directions.<//Review>< pics>

The guys here made shopping here an experience. I went for a skateboard, which they recently started selling in addition to their great selection of records. You could tell that they were super passionate about skating, records, and music in general, and they were really fun to talk with. Great shop!< /Text>

<text>This place is a little jewel in the suburban rough. The vibe they created in this strip mall is worthy of praise.  They have a unique little curated collection of things that I thought only I was into, even a veritable shrine to Blackwing pencils. The only thing was the the prices for the new vinyl seemed high. That said the record I bought ( a limited edition of a new release from the day before) was only $18, so who knows? Regardless, I will be back again.< /text>< gmapID>

Excellent co-op style shop for music lovers! The staff are knowledgeable and friendly. The products are all top notch and made in America (if not made a few miles from there). They seem to value and support the local musicians and craftsmen more than any other place I have been. They have a small selection of used and signed records that are surprisingly high quality and include many rare albums. They also have a selection of extremely nice strats and telecasters, some with an intential worn patina that suits them well. Aside from the products, they also offer live music from local musicians quite often. The support they show for local musicians and the community is heartwarming. I strongly recommend stopping buy.</Text>

Michael is the attorney to get!
He and his team made sure that everything I asked for I got and more. I was in a very bad car accident that was not my fault and without their help, I don’t know where I would be. Their case manager and the whole team made sure that I was kept informed throughout the whole process even if it was something small. My case manager Sasha and Martha helped me with any questions I had and kept their phones on at any time of day. Highly recommended!!!</Review>

The experience I had with this firm as been above excellent. My lawyer went above & beyond to make sure I got all that was deserving of me. They have been keeping me updated with every detail of my case whenever new information comes there way to provide for myself. Personally, I thank you for your swift action towards my case & I honestly would recommend to anybody that has been in any wrongfully mobile accident. I would go back (hopefully no time soon, lord willing) w/o hesitation. Many blessings you guys way.</review>

<Text>Beverly Law Firm is a lifesaver. About 2 years ago I was in a pretty bad car accident involving a large truck. My car was totalled but my body had also been damaged, my back had been badly injured. I luckily had been wearing my seatbelt because without it I don’t know if I would still be here today or able to walk. After going to my insurance company, I realized that they were not looking out for my best interest or my health. I ended up crying to a coworker about the pain I was in and how I didn’t know how I’d get the money to take care of my back and she directed me to speak with the lawyer who had helped her with a similar situation named Michael Shemtoub, from this moment, my whole situation started to change.

Once I was in contact with Beverly Law I realized I was not alone. Insurance companies very seldom want to pay you what you need to fully recover from your injuries after a bad accident. Due to the insurance company’s stubbornness to compensate me, I was aware that the trial process could take time, possibly years, but I was determined to see it through. I had to see it through because I knew it was the only hope I had for being able to pay for the medical treatments I needed to have a hope of getting back to a normal life in the future.

Despite how long the process took, the Beverly Law Office kept me updated every step of the way. I was impatient but I was confident that if there were any updates on my case I would get a call, text, or email from Beverly Law. They even helped my get in contact with the best medical treatment facilities and doctors in the county!

In the end, my case ended up being settled in about a year and I am more than happy with the results. I’m still on the road to a full recovery but at least now I have the financial resources to have a shot at a future where I have a fully functioning body. I’m grateful to Michael, Alex, and Daniel for all their help. I couldn’t have had a better team fighting for me.<//Text>< username>

In 2017, I had a really bad car accident, in which the accident left me both physically and mentally damaged. Immediately after the accident, I reached out to Beverly Law Firm for assistance to handle my case. The opposing insurance company made this case an up-and-down roller coaster ride. However, I had some really good case managers who made the case a lot less stressful. The 2 case managers that stood out for great reasons were Claudia and Guillermo. I will speak honestly and say that I had 2 other case managers who lost contact with me in the middle of the case. However, both Claudia and Guillermo took over my case and handled my treatment process perfectly.

More importantly, I want to point out that Jessica from Accounting is truly the star of the law firm. Throughout my case, she had great communication and problem solving skills. Personally speaking, the accident really impacted me to the point where it left me feeling both depressed and stressed from the head trauma. However, Jessica was fully considerate of my injuries and truly helped me in every part of this case. Anyone who has Jessica involved in their case will be very lucky. She does really great work.

In summary: I am both happy and satisfied with the results of what Beverly Law Firm has accomplished. I truly thank you for your service and help. I highly recommend this law firm.

My experience with Beverly Law was positive. Michael was a fantastic attorney who took the time to explain every aspect of my case and was always there if I had a question. I felt as though the firm truly cared about my well being and was straightforward with the possibilities of my case.

After being t-boned at a stop sign my body did not feel the same. I was left with a lot of pain in my neck and back. Beverly Law immediately sent me to get X-rays and a MRI to make sure I was okay. After that I began to receive treatments such as, chiropractor sessions and pain management. Treatments that I would have not been able to pay without getting an attorney and having no up front costs.

I never wanted to be in a situation were I would need legal assistance, but I was fortunate to have Beverly Law represent me. They were professional and very responsive throughout the entire process. I never was left questioning what was going on with my case. Their advice was always in my best interest and was always at the top of their list.

I can't thank them enough for their professionalism and their help navigating this legal issue. If you find yourself in need of representation, I cannot recommend this firm enough!<//review>

<Text>If you are looking for a attorney to handle your personal injury case look no further. I would rate Beverly Law higher if i could. They went above and beyond to make sure I got the best results.

I was at a complete stop on the freeway when I got rear ended. The person did not see there was traffic and hit me with full speed. The impact was horrible and I went to the emergency room right away. I knew my heath insurance would not cover everything so I got a attorney to help me get compensation for my awful pain.

I appreciated how supportive and available they were all the time. It made things much easier for me because they were very thorough and considerate with the whole process. They connected me with the best medical professionals who really helped me recover from my injuries. Guillermo also made sure to help me find transportation to my doctors appointments. Beverly law was such a great help.

I cannot be happier with my results and the excellent service I got here. The team and attorney are genuine people who always make sure you are well taken care of.< /Text><pics>None</pics></record>

I was in a unfortunate car crash little over year ago. I had been rear ended at a stop sign, the person did realize it was a stop sign not a traffic light. The car crash left my car not only wrecked but unsafe for the road. I knew I needed a lawyer that would fight to get me a good settlement for a new car and enough for my personal injury treatments. I was unsure on which law firm to choose from. I also wanted to make sure they were no up front cost and they were a law firm that only charged when they won.

That is when I came across Beverly Law firm. The staff were open to address any of my questions or concerns. My case manager Guillermo was very involved in the case and was always on top of everything. He was reassuring and confident in his line of work. Once I informed Guillermo about my back and neck pain, he was quick to set up appointments with a chiropractor and also for pain management. It was relief to me not only physically but also mentally.

Overall, if you want the best legal representation then I would highly suggest this law firm. As the people here are compassionate and care a lot about getting you the right care for your personal injuries. They were such a big help in my life.</text>

I cannot say enough good about Beverly Law! After my auto accident I went to a highly advertised law firm and was never able to talk to a lawyer and had to constantly call and see what was going on. That is when I decided to change to Beverly Law. Lupe was quick to show compassion regarding my personal injuries, and I could tell they would handle my case professionally. After meeting with the personal injury attorney, it was even more clearer that this firm had the right knowledge to get me the best settlement.

My experience with this law firm was great, as they were on from the get go and Martha called frequently to check on my progress. I was extremely pleased with the settlement. I would recommend them to anyone who needs help with a personal injury accident case.< /review>

Having Beverly Law on my side changed everything after my accident. It was hard to get the strength to fight back after being involved in a truck accident. My body was in pain (specifically my back) and my insurance company was not offering me fair compensation for recovery. There was no way I would be able to go back to living a normal life without medical treatment and though they covered the cost of my car they weren’t offering me much more than that!

This is when I started looking into legal representation. I got in contact with Michael after reading through multiple yelp reviews of lawyers in my area. I figured I would give him a call and see if he could help me. He answered the phone so quickly it was like he was expecting me. We talked for a while and he made me feel confident that he was the right choice. He had worked with many insurance companies in the past to get fair settlements for other clients and after speaking with him I felt like he could get a fair settlement for me too.

From start to finish this process took about 16 months. I had to have a lot of patience as the Insurance company was pretty set on not compensating me for the injuries I sustained in the accident. However, Michael and the Beverly Law team were never discouraged. The team communicated with me throughout the whole process. If I had questions I could call or email them and they got back to me pretty quickly each time. In the end, Beverly Law helped me to settle my case for more than what I had originally expected and I am happy am on the road to a full recovery and have the means to receive the treatments I need.< /text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Text>I was in a terrible car accident where my car was destroyed and declared a total loss. Then the insurance did not want to give me enough money for the treatment that I need. That is why I got a lawyer, to give me the legal representation that I needed for my personal injuries. I got a MRI and X-rays taken because I had horrible pain. Beverly Law got me the medication I needed to help with the pain. It was great that I was being treated for my personal injuries without having to worry about any up front cost. I was also taking chiropractor sessions and pain management treatment. I ended up needinginjections for my back, as I was experiencing a lot of pain. All of my treatment was covered and I received a amazing amount of money for my compensation. This law firm is excellent as Lupe constantly kept in touch with me, and Jessica made sure I was updated with any change in my case.< /Text>< gmapID>

I normally don't write reviews. But Beverly Law is just amazing comparing to the other lawyers I've gone through. If you are in the process of searching for a good attorney, no need to look further! Michael will genuinely help you and make you feel valued and respected! Jane on the team always kept me updated so I really felt like they are fighting along with me but not like the other lawyers who just want your money and ignore you. Thank you Beverly Law!</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Michael is the best personal injury lawyer you can find in Los Angeles! I was in a Uber accident last year and my insurance wouldn’t cover my medical bills. So I started looking around for personal injury lawyers and went to another law firm to get help. But the other lawyer would not return my calls after our first meeting, and my friend told me about Beverly Law. So I called Michael and he was able to schedule an appointment for me the next day for a free consultation. I went and I found him just to be a lot more trustworthy than the other lawyer I had.

It turned out I made the right choice. Michael and his team always updates me on the progress of the case. Jane on the team had great customer service. I was also able to get medical treatments without paying anything upfront. My case was also resolved so I had enough to cover medical bills and continue other types of treatments like chiropractors and pain managements. THANK YOU MICHAEL!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I was a passenger in my friend's car when the accident occurred. We were driving straight when a car came out of the parking lot. The car came out of nowhere and it came out pretty fast. It hit the front part of the car. We were two young people, she was driving her moms but was under the insurance.

Right after the crash I was really shaky and did not know what to do. My friend tried to get herself together to exchange information with the other driver. I was pretty in shock and at the moment felt fine. The next day my friend and I both started to gain pain in our bodies.

A few days later she told him her mom had hired a lawyer. I'm glad they found Beverly Law because they were a big help and I did not have to worry about any upfront costs. That was perfect since I did not have any money, which was why I was not able to get treatment at the moment either. They really helped me understand how the case would go, which was nice knowing what is going on in your case. The person in charge of my case, Guillermo, was wonderful and made sure I knew of any changes on my case. He also gave me a great chiropractor place that was nearby where I live. The pain management was a great help as well. I was happy with my compensation and happy my friend's mom found this firm.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b8e704a51c93:0x8ff2e1cb54878b25</Gmap_id></record>

<review>My car accident seemed like nothing major to me at first. As I did not feel any pain and the back side of my bumper not destroyed. But after two days the pain in my back started to get worse. I decided to get a personal injury lawyer as I was worried about my back.

My dad had already hired Beverly Law for legal representation after his truck accident case so I knew they were good. I contacted them and they were happy to help me with my case. Their first concern were getting me to the chiropractor to start my treatment and also my pain management treatment. Throughout the process Lupe would call me to see how I was doing and to tell me if there was or wasn't any updates. I was happy with my results with this car accident attorney.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1582062415865, 'text': "Thank you for your review Carlos.

I was in a car accident when I was a passenger with a friend. We had been rear ended when we were at a complete stop on the freeway. It has to be one of my scariest experience. I was in complete shock after and could not process what had just happened. Thankfully my friend was on top on things and got a great attorney for us.

Right after the accident I did not feel any pain. I felt my body tensed up but did not imagine it would become pain. The next day I could hardly move and my back was killing me. Thankfully Guillermo, the case manager, at already found a chiropractor and pain management near me. I took a lot of medicine at first for my personal injuries but after a few chiropractor sessions I started taking less.

Also at the beginning of the case I was not sure of how the process went and thought they would not really keep in touch. However, Beverly Law was the opposite, they really explained how the case would move. They kept in  touch, informing me all the way to the end. The attorney was very diligent and attentive in making sure he got the best outcome for me, as while as for my friend.

My case just closed and I got my check. They continue to work during this lock down. I am happy I was able to receive such a great compensation during this time because I am not working. I do not wish for others to get injured but if you are personally injured make sure to get Beverly Law so they can give you the legal representation you need.</Review>

I had a personal injury happen to me in Los Angeles and injured my spine, and was looking for an attorney to help me with my injury. My father referred me to call Michael. I was very satisfied with how they took care of my injury case, and always called me with updates on how everything was going. Michael and his team are the best law firm I have ever worked with. Michael Shemtoub always went above and beyond to make sure I got the most money and best treatments for my case. If you are looking for a law firm that actually cares about you and not just your money Michael and associates are a good Law office. I recommend them. Hopefully, I do not need them again but I know who to call.< /Text>

I was involved in a terrifying accident where I was turning into a parking lot and another driver who was obviously speeding out of the lot rammed into my car door. I was experiencing radiating pain all throughout the left side of my body and was scared out of my mind since I was over six months pregnant at the time. I was immediately taken to the ER and then a women's center where they focused on getting movement and heartbeat of my baby.

I knew I needed legal representation and I was relieved when Beverly Law decided to take on my case. My amazing case manager Guillermo kept me on top of all my appointments and linked me to the best chiropractor and spine institute. Throughout this lengthy process, I was always kept in the loop about what was going on about the case, whether it was an email or phone call.

Michael Shemtoub and his team are the best of the best when it comes to personal injury lawyers. With their expertise in the field, I was able to walk away with a solid settlement, but more importantly, appropriate treatment for myself and my baby so we can make a full recovery. If you ever find yourself in an accident, call Beverly Law!< /text>

<review>Last year I was involved in a pretty awful car accident. The wreck left me with injuries to my neck, back, and right leg. I was sitting in the passenger's seat of my Uber driver's car when we were t-boned by a car that ran a stop sign. The whole ordeal was very shocking and left me in a bit of a daze. In the days that followed, I experienced multiple headaches and had trouble concentrating. My neck was sensitive to move and my lower back and right leg were in a severe amount of pain.

I reached out to Beverly Law after a family friend recommended them. That's when Michael let me know that he could help. From there the Beverly Law Team, help connect me to medical treatment with no upfront medical costs. Jessica, my case manager, kept me updated on my treatment schedule and helped me to plan my appointments. She even arranged transportation for me when I did not have anyone to take me to my medical treatments.

After listening to Beverly Law and being consistent with my treatment, my case settled in about a year and a half. Michael got me enough money in my settlement to cover my medical costs, get a new vehicle, and continue my treatment. I am grateful for the law firms help and would recommend them to anyone who is in need of a lawyer after a major accident.<//review>< pictures>

My husband and I were in a car crash, thru no fault of our own,the person who hit us took ownership immediately. For a little less than 2 yrs we were dealing with Beverly Law. We had multiple case managers, when we had questions no one would return calls. They would set up MRIs that were a 3 hour drives, 1 way , the only good thing out of this was we found a great chiropractor, which happened to be close by. As we are getting closer to the 2 year mark I started getting call backs, and more of an urgent “ let’s get this taken care of” mentality. At the same time my mother passed away and I had to leave the state. Mentally I was a mess, Beverly Law had no compassion, they just wanted to close out my case. So they did , right before the 2 year mark, we each, my husband and I received a very small check ,  my day  majority of the monies we should have gotten were given to the Drs we didn’t even see and so many from Beverly Law got more than we even gotfor all our pain and suffering during this ordeal , and the fact they wanted to close this out so fast, it seemed as soon as I mentioned my mother passing and how devastated I was they couldn’t get rid of us fast enough

Up date ,, same day I wrote this I actually got a call back from Jessica? Why now?  Anyway , just moving on now,still injured but with a strong life lesson learned<//Text>

<Review>Not to long ago, I found myself in the position of needing a lawyer after being injured in a bad truck accident. I was at my absolute worst and needed some one to help me through an already rough situation. That’s when I found the Beverly Law team.

It took nearly a year to get everything resolved but Beverly Law took care of me through all the ups and downs. They even helped coach me before I went before the judge so that I would be calm and able to properly express the facts! Their whole office is amazing and I am so happy to have had winners in my corner through this whole ordeal.<//Review><Date>1576695154640<//Date>< Pictures>

Getting into a motorcycle accident is not on anyone’s to-do list, so when I got into mine I was nowhere near prepared for what came next. I had luckily taken all the necessary precautions to try and prevent death in the event of an accident but there was no avoiding injury when I was hit from behind and flung off of my bike. My work laptop was completely decimated by the impact with the pavement and the backpack that had been carrying it was torn apart.  I came out with not only a concussion and road rash but with multiple broken and fractured bones. My helmet, moto jacket, and riding pants had saved my life but there was sadly no saving my bike.

At that point I was at an all time low, my insurance wasn’t willing to pay enough for all of my expenses and recovery. I knew I needed a lawyer because I was in a hard place through no fault of my own and was now, somehow, the one paying for it. That's when  I reached out to Beverly Law after reading through their reviews on Google and Yelp. I ended up speaking with Michael directly and knew from our first phone call that he was the lawyer for me because he had case experience involving Mercury Insurance.

The trial process was not quick. From the accident to actually being paid out , it took almost 2 and a half years! When I first started this process, I had no concept of how long it would take because I had never been through anything like this before and that led me to feel really impatient throughout most of this situation. However, I really appreciate the updates I got throughout that time from the Beverly Law team. Being contacted by the team of people working on my case consistently, really helped to keep me in the loop. Overall, regardless of the time frame Beverly Law was consistently in communication with me regarding the status of my trial and also took my calls when I was impatient for answers. I can happily say that the wait was worth it for me, as Beverly Law won my case and I was awarded enough money to have a completely fresh start following my accident.< /Text>

Oh what to say about Beverly Law, I want to start by thanking the people that helped me THE MOST during my case. Alex, you are a fantastic case manager. I appreciate you keeping everything so organized and being a kind face every time I visited the office. I also want to thank Martha and Sasha, for all of the snacks water and coffee brought to me throughout my time at the Beverly Law office. You both made kept me well-fed, hydrated, and laughing during one of the most difficult times in my life and were so empathetic of my situation, you will never know how much your kindness meant to me.

Last but certainly not least, I want to thank Michael Shemtoub. Michael was absolutely AMAZING! He literally took phone calls from me no matter the time of day. He directed his staff to help me find the best medical care for my injuries and was real with me. He put so much time into my case, I really can’t imagine that any of the other attorneys I spoke with would have put this much energy into my situation.

How I ended up having to come to Beverly Law started with one of the worst experiences of my life! On my way home from work I was hit by a delivery truck, my car was totalled and I could barely get out of my car after the incident the damage to my vehicle and my body were so bad. My back had been badly injured, and though I’m a person who usually lets things heal on their own (I hate the doctors office), the pain I was experiencing was too bad for me to ignore.

After going to multiple doctors and getting very little help from my insurance company, I knew I needed a lawyer. I talked to Michael and he made me aware that he had worked on several cases similar to mine. Sasha and Alex both helped me to get connected with the right doctors for my back and Michael set up a phone call with one of his past clients that helped me through the decision to get a lumbar fusion.

My life has been forever changed by this experience. Beverly Law Firm won my case, but they did a lot more than that for me. I’m so grateful for their support. I appreciate everyone who worked to get my case resolved. I highly recommend Beverly Law Firm, though I hope to NEVER be in a situation to need them again.</Text>

I was so lucky to find Beverly Law. After speaking with Michael Shemtoub about my case I was reassured by the fact he had experience working with other clients that had been hit and injured by a Lyft driver. I could tell by his tone that he was taking my situation seriously and that he cared about my health and future.

Having my car completely destroyed was bad in itself, but the crash effected my body and mind too. I spent most days following the incident having a hard time getting out of bed and found the pain in my neck, shoulders, and lower back getting progressively worse. While talking with the Beverly Law team I was able to get in contact with some of the best doctors in LA County for my medical treatment. This made has made all the difference over time and has helped me not to lose faith that a normal life is something I can have after my accident changed everything.

Michael and The Beverly Law Team, were able to win my case and get me  the money I needed to restart my life after this terrible ordeal and to continue the treatments I need to feel like myself. I am so thankful to Michael and the team because without them I don't know if I would have won my case and have the money I need to continue treatment for the long road ahead.

If you are reading this review and you are at a low point, you've been injured and are suffering painfully due to someone else's negligence, call Michael. Don't let big companies like Lyft hurt you and get away with it. Beverly Law stood up for me, let them stand up for you. Sometimes your insurance agency isn't able to go that extra mile for you the way a lawyer will. Michael went the extra mile for me and so did his whole team! I want to thank Sasha and Alex for their help as well, you both always made me feel warm and welcome in their office and gave me pillows for my back so that I could sit comfortably.</text>

I was a passenger in a lift vehicle. The driver made a very difficult turn that they should have and because of that we got into an accident. I was stuck in the middle where both insurance companies were denying who was at fault and in the meantime my laptop was broken and not being paid for. I was a student at the time and I felt like nobody was really fighting for me so I got referred to these people and they really helped me out. I got my new laptop LOL which I’m excited about. I also had some pretty gnarly injuries and they were able to find doctors for me that attended to me so keep doing what you’re doing and thanks for helping me out<//Text>

<username>Houtan Goulla</username><Date>1577213850124< /Date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>Beverly Law Firm is a great law office filled with hard working people. Alex does a great job updating you on your case. Martha will always offer you snacks and drinks when you come into the office to meet with Michael. I don’t care about what diet you may be on, make sure to accept the snacks! They are delicious and the cookies and coffee will definitely be worth it. Michael Shemtoub is one of the best lawyers in Los Angeles. He is a kind man that actually cares about the people he’s working for just as much as he cares about their cases.

Beverly Law is the place to go for help for anyone whos been in a car accident and has experienced injury. Sasha and Jessica will help you get the right treatment for your injuries by connecting you with medical providers who have helped their previous clients and have done a great job. The best chiropractors and surgeons in Los Angeles County have direct contact with Michael’s team and make space on their calendars for his clients. If you are not 100% confident about a certain treatment, Michael will arrange a call for you with a previous client whose had that treatment so that you can make an informed decision to do whats best for you and your body.

Overall, I highly recommend Michael and his team. They are a lovely bunch of people who are doing their best to help those who have gone through life-changing experiences. I’m happy to know Michael and to have him in my corner. I would only ever have Michael Shemtoub represent me in the future because I doubt I’d ever come across a staff as kind and caring as his.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>While driving for Uber I was rear-ended and had no clue what to do. Driving for Uber was a simple way to make ends meet for me. However, the accident left me with severe injuries to my neck and back and also totaled my car. I was unable to work my regular job some days because I was in so much pain and when the insurance company tried to pay me out they offered me barely enough money to replace my vehicle, let along address treatment of my injuries so I reached out to Michael from Beverly Law. I was in between a rock and a hard place and one of my friends had told me about the attorney that helped her when she was in her car accident. I was a little bit skeptical if he could do anything for me because I had been driving for Uber at the time of my accident but he assured me that he had worked on cases like mine before and would do everything in his power to win my case. I ended up having to get an MRI, then see a chiropractor. I ended up getting injections in my back and though they helped me to feel better briefly, I wound up having to get a lumbar fusion to relieve the pain. Through this whole process Beverly Law was helping guide me and give me support.

I can happily say that Michael settled my case for far more than what the insurance company originally tried to offer me for this accident. I did not ask to be hit and I certainly did not do anything to provoke it. I was really just caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, but knowing what I know now, I am so happy I sought legal representation. If you find yourself in my shoes, go see michael. He'll help you get what you deserve.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I’ve personally had a case with Beverly law. They were very detail oriented and took their time. I had to be patient but they got me the results they promised. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable on getting the medical treatment I needed. I had a difficult case where the insurance company was unwilling to pay for my medical bills bc of my small property damage but they were persistent and got my medical bills paid for. Most other attorneys didn’t want to take my case so I’m appreciative to them for taking my case and helping me out! No one  believed I had real pain from such small damage except for Beverly law.

So this person decided to be smart and make a quick left turn in front of me. I didn’t have a stop sign or anything so that person had to stop and wait for me to pass by. Guess what they did? They didn’t stop. We got into a collision and I had to find someone because the guy decided to change his word and say it was my fault even though he was apologetic at the accident. I found Michael’s officeAnd he told me he will change things around but that I had to just wait and be patient because it’s a different type of case. Of course sure enough he followed through on his word and got me the payment that I was waiting for. Thanks again for everything that you did for me</Text>

I got hit by Uber Driver and it was a very difficult time in my life I’m glad that I found this office at Beverly Law because they were very helpful. I didn’t have medical insurance I didn’t know who was going to pay for my medical bills after the Uber driver hit me but they were able to find me doctors that would treat me with no co-pay and no money and no medical insurance. So I’m definitely very grateful to them. They had good communication with me where they spoke to me once every two months. But the most important thing was just being patient because of course the insurance company is always trying to deny stuff so I’m glad they came through for me<//Text>

I was involved in a car accident over a year ago which was a hit and run case. I went to Mr. Mike Shemtoub, he was very helpful, punctual, and followed me in a timely manner to get thru my case. I highly recommend him to represent anyone who’s been an a auto accident he will get you what you deserve.</text>

I was part of a rideshare accident where my driver was driving properly but someone hit our car in the driveway in a hit-and-run accident. It was very difficult and scary for us because we literally had to chase down the person. (Photo of their damage posted for reference).  The person didn't have insurance of course we had to go through the insurance of the rideshare and they were really difficult. We found this law firm through a recommendation and they were really easy to use and work with. They helped me with my lost wages and Michael helped me out throughout my case. He was really sweet and caring and got me the results I wanted. Thanks!!! Michael told me to be patient. So I was patient and sure enough he delivered on his promise.</text>

< Review>
I got into a very bad accident back in Aug last year, when me my boyfriend and my friends were driving towards Orange county to go to our relatives house, when all of a sudden a car swerved in front of us into the carpool lane. We crashed and totaled our car, while the other driver was severely injured. No one in our car had any signs of major injuries, except me and my boyfriend sitting next to me who got injured. We were all distressed when the accident happened, but the employees of this law firm made us feel safe and comfortable by giving us one of the best customer experience that I’ve had. Me and my boyfriend who had undergone Chiropractor, orthopedic, pain management and epidurals and was treated promptly, we were guided throughout the process after the incident, and most of all, we were never left in the dark even after the case was close. I would definitely recommend this law firm to anyone who needs exceptional, reliable, and professional help.

Me and my boyfriend would like to thanked Atty. Shemtoub and their team from the bottom of our heart’s who have helped throughout this experience of our case and for recommending their network for a “lawsuit cash advance” namely, FCA Legal Funding so we could thrive while we’re out of work for daily expenses.</Review>

This law firm was great in the beginning. As others would say we also spoke to multiple people all the time. A young lady gave me false information, later I did my research and realized she didn’t know what she was talking about. They lied threatening my son to sign papers because of a deadline just to cover themselves. False documents were also sent to doctors. I DO NOT recommend!!!< /text>

This firm is the epitome of professional. I have worked with Michael and his team twice and because of their professionalism and honesty I always refer them to family and friends.

A t-bone accident can really shake you up but the BLF team referred me to the best doctors and took care of the rest. No matter how many times I contacted the firm (including weekends!) they took the time to answer any questions I had. Michael never shied away from a call and he made himself readily available to me which was helpful especially after normal business hours. I lost my job during the case and was nervous of fees but stayed calm and relaxed until the firm had to do their job. I'm so glad I did because the case settled for more than I had expected.<//text>

Beverly Law gave me high hope when signing on my personal auto injury case back in 2017. Michael Shemtoub promised to handle my case to the end and the sales pitch was amazing. My case is a solid case to prevail, where my car was hit by another care and everything was recorded by my dash camera video. I gathered and sent in all my evidence and medical treatment record. The other party admitted fault and everything is more than easy. But the communication from Beverly Law Firm is awful, I had to wait for many months before they informed me the progress.
Guess what, after 1 year and 11 months (only 1 month away from 2 years statute of limitations), I suddenly receive an email saying that they dropped my case today.  Haha, baiting customer in at first, wasting customer's time, and ruining my case. I think this law firm is basically an scam, please never work with this law firm! This will happen to you!</Text>

Don’t waste your time with this law firm.
Wasted my time trying to settle an accident with a big trailer truck side swiped me. I did all the work, all the research that they asked and they didn’t do a single thing but “tough talk.” Said we had a big settlement and it’s being taken care of. 2 months go by, haven’t heard from them ever since.
Do not give them your social security number, glad I didn’t. If they read this. We’ll see if they contact me back now.....

Bad business bureau gave them an “F” score! How worse can this business get! Avoid at all costs even if they tell you “ you won’t pay unless you win” tactic.

(Don’t contact me to say sorry or anything. I won’t respond or read this at all. Good luck and please go out of business)<//text>

They have officially stopped taking my calls and returning them. I don’t pester them. But today marks a year since my accident and other party was found at fault within the month. Is this a real office?

Update: my rating was from 6 months ago. I talked to the 5th case manager around 3months ago saying it will take around this amount of time to get paper work from the hospital I went to. I call and guess what? Another case manager! But no answer straight to voice mail. Going to contact the hospital and other partys insurance to see if they're crooks.</review>

Terrible experience. They handled my accident case for 3 years. They change adjustor very frequently. Everytime you have to deal with new person. Very hard to contact them. They usually not answer calls and also don't give updates. They paid me 1.5 years after they receive settlement amount from insurance.They keep me telling same thing for 2 years. Also my doctor advised me for physiotherapy session. Their adjustor convince me to go through their partner (Key help) and assured me it will cost me less, I believed him and after 2 years I came to know it costs me $3k more. They also charge you additional costs for legal charges apart from 30% which they don't tell you initially.
In my case settlement amount was way less than they initially convinced me for. Michael is somehow fine but their team and adjustors are very poor.< /Text>

My salaried not hourly pay structure was Monday thru Friday from 7AM-7PM including a 1 hour lunch for $10K pesos every two weeks! That would equal $1,000.00 MX pesos every payday. If unfair to their employees, imagine clients? The things he has told me about how he has withheld potential lawsuits from becoming higher paid lawsuits and how he was able to assure the client wasn't getting 1/3 of the winnings with added fee's and necessities! You should ask to see a copy of your file in writing to make sure you received what you were entitled too! He is cheating and mistreating his Remote employees in Mexico and the Philippines, these are the people that work on your cases, these are the account managers, I was one Joaquin Cano.

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>I was quite disappointed in the quality of food in this small cafe. I typically figure these types of cafes pay attention to quality to keep customers coming back, but not today. I ordered the country breakfast, which seems simple enough. My biscuits were flat, tough, and tasted reheated. I’ve had better from Popeyes of all places. The hash browns were tasteless and required more salt/pepper than usual. I actual needed ketchup and I never use ketchup. The eggs were pretty normal so no real complaint there. my wife had a waffle that looked to be cooked well, but again made with a batter that ruined the thick and fluffy taste you would expect. Other than what seems to be low quality ingredients, the service was great and place was clean.  If the food was improved I would surely visit again.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80844a5983f42bc9:0x23234f1a66c88adb<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>EXCELLENT service. Well we had one less than stellar waitress but the owner came over to greet us, not because we had said anything, but because he is very friendly and enjoys checking in on diners. The food is always hot, fresh, tasty, portioned well and ready quickly. Pepper's is never really crowded or noisy. We enjoy our breakfast dates. Thank you Pepper's!!</text>< Pictures>

Went here with a friend. The staff were very friendly and nice. The food sounded delicious and the presentation was good, but that's where it ends. My friend and I were both disappointed with the lack of flavor in the food, and after a few mouthfuls just tasted like grease. Left there full and unsatisfied.< /Review>

We went at 1 p.m. on a Wednesday. NEVER EVER go here between 1 and 2:30 during the week. There must have been 50 students from Rancho whom all ordered fries at the same time. Which means the 4 guys cooking, yes 4 were back in the kitchen, couldn't be bothered to get our three breakfasts out properly cooked, proportioned, nor warm. Raw bacon, only 2 meats in a 3 meat skillet, raw cold potatoes, forgotten toast! The lone trained waitress was awesome tho! Two stars only for the waitress!
Couldn't wait to get out of there!<//Text>

I love this place! They have a huge menu of food! But the only catch is how long it takes for your food to be made. But the place was delicious anyways!</Review>

nice people and good service, however the quality of ingredients was really bad, and careless preparation. I found hair in my lady's eggs, coffee quality was gas station level, whatever syrup we had with our pancakes was Aunt Jemima's level. We both agreed that we would not be returning as we felt sick for hours following the meal. Sorry we need quality food.</text>

Dr. Todd and Dr. Jamie are amazing. I came here yesterday with a sudden very painful injury and they've taken great care of me so far. They are very informative and personable. I am totally new to chiropractic care and am happy and comforted that they explain what they're doing as they do it. I will definitely be coming back here for any future chiropractic needs.</Review>

< Review>
I walked into the Joint on beach Boulevard in kinda bad shape and filled  out the questionnaire. Todd talk to me and ask me questions and gave me his thoughts on on my condition. Todd is very knowledgeable and helped me understand my back and challenges. When I walk out I feel considerably better mentally and physically. The back is the main frame of the body< /Review>

Dr Todd is an amazing chiropractor. He is so caring. His knowledge of ergonomics and expertise are incredible. After years of dance, working at a desk and motherhood.. He has definitely helped me maintain my wellbeing after seeing him on a regular basis. My body has been feeling better, thank you Dr Todd!</review>

Please give Dr.. Baker more days. He is the best. He has been taking care of my back for almost 4 years. He is such a great Chiropractor. I've seen other Chiropractors and have been in pain when I leave but not with Dr. Baker or Dr. Jamie.</text>

<Review>I have alot of back/sciatica issues which are so debilitating to say the least. I am from the UK and  now living in Orange County. I used to see a Chiropractor  before and started to search for one here as I was in so much pain which causes me to feel very depressed.  After searching for a Chiropractor I found  The joint  Chiropractic. The girl on reception was so nice. I filled out all the paperwork then had my first session with Dr.Todd. He asked many questions about my situation then started to do his magic. I felt so relieved that finally my pains would disappear  after so long. I went back a few times a week which as suggested and was feeling such relief after my adjustments. Then Covid  came so I didn't go back for a while and then all the pain returned. So with mask on  I'm going back and look forward to it so much.
Thank you Dr. Todd 😊</Review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
My daughter has been seeing both Dr Todd and Dr Jamie and she loves them both. Both genuinely shows great interests in her well being. Dr Todd has been seeing my daughter the most and I can’t tell you how wonderful he is. He’ll make her feel super comfortable by having a small chat with her, he’ll then tell her what he’ll be doing before doing it and best of all....he’s like a parent engaging in a conversation with his own child asking her how her day was, what she’s been doing and etc. While I’m sitting there watching and listening to their conversations with a big smile on my face. Dr Todd is not only a great Dr, he is also a great person overall in my book. Dr Jamie as well. I don’t think anyone can go wrong if they get one or the other Dr.
There is this one gentleman that sits at the front desk, his name is Dan. Dan has a wonderful smile and is always happy when we walk in the door. He’ll have small conversations with us and ALWAYS have a nice warm smile. When we’re done, he’ll say bye to us and will greet us off so warmly and so nicely. Overall, the office environment is so nice and warm when Dan is around. 👍🏼
I highly recommend this clinic to anyone who needs a correction to fix whatever pain they’re in. My daughter before coming here was in so much pain that a 15 yrs old like her shouldn’t be in. Due to “The Joint” and their affordability, I’m able to take her in 4x’s a month and she feels so good and now she’s a happy and tired 15yrs old with minimal to no pain. Happiness is due to them, tiredness; well, they can’t help her with that. 😊<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Great experience, affordable and fixed my thrown out back. Will have a more detailed review after a full nights rest. For $29 the adjustment was well worth it. Instantly felt way better. Initially there was so much pain while trying to stand up or even walk just a few steps. I can now walk with very minor pain, standing up is a breeze. I know I am only 26 but going to the chiropractor every month might be something I start doing to maintain a healthly spine and overall body.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>I've had lingering neck pain from what i believe to be a pinched nerve. my neck and back were stiff and i lacked mobility. Dr. Todd was very professional and relieved a lot of pain for me. He made sure to explain everything he was doing and why it would benefit me. If I was in town more often, I would definitely make more visits. The staff is also really nice.< /Text>< GmapID>

For someone that hates massages and just in general doctors . This place is amazing I have been dealing with some bad back pain and Dr. Tod was very helpful in explaining everything and also making me feel comfortable. After my visit I had awesome results the pain was almost completely gone and my neck felt a huge relief. Thank you and can’t wait to come back in a few days .</Review>

< Review>
I've been using Chiropractors since I was 15.
I am very picky as to who I let work on me. In fact I went close to a year because my Chiropractor of over 15 years was simply too far away. [I moved to HB]

So I decided to give this "Joint" a try. Well after just 1 visit to the Huntington Beach location, I found my new Chiropractor!

The location is convenient, freeway close and both the staff and the Doctors are AMAZING!

Give The Joint Chiropractic a try. The only thing you gotta lose is that pain that's been messing up your life!

Do yourself a solid and sign up for the monthly program. Unless of course your health and comfort is not worth a few dollars a month.</Review>

First time here. Walked in with a pain in my upper back, hard to turn my head, and hurt to take a deep breath. After my adjustment I could move more freely with less pain. Love the open atmosphere and friendly staff!<//review>

Dr. Todd did a great job of adjusting my neck and back all throughout my pregnancy and keeping me as pain-free as possible. He also gave me excellent tips of what I could do at home to keep things on track. I kept coming right up until my due date. In fact, Dr. Todd adjusted me the day before I gave birth! He always works with you to accommodate whatever you may have going on. Even though my last few months of adjustments were done with me on my side and back it left me feeling great!!! So thankful for the good work they do here. Plus the joint makes chiropractic care affordable for those whose insurance doesn't cover it.< /Text>< userid>

<text>This is my favorite of the Joints in area. Dr. Todd is amazing. He always remembers me and my needs. I always feel better when I leave, and coming here has left lasting impressions to correct my historically injured spine. The staff is always friendly, too. I don't know where I would be without this place.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<date>1579468470400<//date><rating>5<//rating><Review>Ok fine... ill post a review... 😆 only cuz i think this place is that good.  And i wanna help this place that has been so worthwhile to me.  They mainly consist of two of the same chiropractors that talk to you (i mean give u advice too) for the duration of your visit 5-10 minutes for the crackling.  But i can see the effort they make to have it feel unrushed where they'd extend the talk/treatment for u even when ur rdy to go out the door and already walking towards the exit 😆.  Today i told my chiro (theres a male and female who are both knowledgable and like... talk to u and give u info like ur in a classroom) that i was getting a lil burnt out and he responded, among other things that its ok to be selfish and tend to yourself, which is already in a way what im already doing by being "here" at the joint.  I was like.  Oh man hes right 😆.  Go me???  Other times hed say things like...my back and my muscle and my shoulders and stuff like that which is kind of boring to read about in a review, in a way lol.  And actually you know what.  You can prod him and her for info and you dont have to go to school for it, which is a nice perk for me.  Im always working with my hands and its nice to streamline my particular conditioning with the correct and trusted answers they provide without doing the work to research it 😆.

Now i work with better form and know how to stretch and stuff to better my understanding intimately for my job, which puts me at an advantage compared to others at my workplace.

Thank you @the joint chiropractic.  The particular people you have chosen for this location are very valuable to me.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I drive an hour round trip at least once or twice a week just to be treated by Dr. Cunningham. He’s the only one that can fix me. But then I go and mess myself up again 🤷‍♀️I have a 3 year old who thinks I’m a human jungle gym< /Text>< pics>

If you would like us to follow up on this please contact us at the clinic and provide your contact information and we will get back to you shortly.\n\nBest in Health,\nThe Joint Chiropractic\u200b"}<//Response>< Text>
I called this location at 3:45pm to ask if they can help with my back issue Dan explained that they can help me for $29 which sounds like a steal I advise I would head over I got here at 4:02pm and he decides to look at me and say they are closing at 5:00pm and wouldn’t have time.. next time don’t make people drive to you and still after one hour of being open you can’t help me!! It irritates me when workers decided to decline service just to get out on time!!! Would not recommend< /Text>

Dr. Todd is very professional, while still maintaining a great sense of humor. I have gotten migraines from the time I was about 10, and I started seeing a chiropractor around that time. I'm always picky about who works on my neck and when I found the joint I wasn't sure whether I was going to find anyone I would like or not, but dr. Todd does a great job! Highly recommend him whether you new to chiropractic or have been going for years.<//review>

<review>Dr. Todd took great care of me, adjusted me in ways I haven't experienced even at a more expensive office. Very happy with the experience I signed up for the monthly package right away.</review>< gmapID>

I found this store while in the area. The staff here is very friendly, knowledgeable and definitely make you feel welcome. Shout out to Charlie who who is a great conversationalist and provided me with recommendations to switch up collection of juices. The location itself is very clean and well kept. Amazing customer service, a large variety of juices and at a fair price... will definitely be coming back.< /review>

So I went to every vape store in the valley and was met with non friendly in patient people. Until I met Charlie at the Vape Lodge 2 not only was he willing to take the time to explain everything he’s part of the reason I was able to quit smoking. Thank you Charlie , I recommend the Vape Lodge 2 to anyone in need of 100% satisfaction.< /review>

This shop has everything you're looking for to satisfy your vaping needs from mods to juices. If you haven't yet, stop by and check it out. On top of all that, there's Charlie, who happens to be extremely well versed in vape knowledge.< /review>

<date>1573501995518< /date><rating>5</rating><review>I like this place. Normally, walking into a vape shop is kind of like walking into a circus dressing room. Not Vape Lodge.

Most of the time there is sports on the tv and though the guys are knowledgeable they dont talk down to you. I ask a lot of questions and these dudes always have an educated answer.

They have a decent sized selection of mods and atomizers.  I usually just come in for coils and juice. By the way, they have the best deal on 100mg bottles. 2 for $35!!!  Say what??  For reals. It's quality stuff, too. There's no one in the back watering it down.

If you're local and need anything I would highly suggest stopping in and supporting these guys.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Maghen is an excellent hair stylist!  She colored and styled my hair today.  They are all excellent!  Didn't she do a great job, though?  So remember to come to Fantastic Sam's on Melrose Avenue in Vista, CA.  All if their stylists are extremely talented!  Jenn, Adrianne,, Maghen, and Rosie have all worked on my hair and have done a marvelous job.  There are a couple other stylists at this site, but they haven't all worked on my hair, yet, but I know that anyone who works at this particular Fantastic Sam is the best! Koo no<//text>

First experience my hair turned out a disaster but Adrian, the manager, went out of her way to ensure my hair was fixed properly, looked great and was honest on what she thought was best treatment for my hair. Not concerned about making more money. I appreciate the honesty, even though I was unable to get the highlights I wanted she explained she cared more about damaging my hair at that time. She welcomed me to come back every month to try a strand test again until my hair is able to tolerate the treatment. That meant more above all else.< /review>

I've been going to Fantastic Sams Cut & Color for 5 years and would never go anywhere else! Julia is the best and is basically the older sister I never had.</Review>

Alexa is amazing! She fixed my badly dyed hair from an amateur at another salon. She is super friendly and accommodating. She's very professional and works very hard. I will definitely be back!<//Review>

Was pleasantly surprised by good color and highlights. They seem to be very tentative about their cuts though. Whenever I have asked for 3+ inches off or for pronounced layers, they don't seem to do all that much to make the difference I was asking for.<//Text>

<review>The first time I went here I received a decent highlight and haircut but that was the only time I had service. Location was very convenient and close to home.  After returning,  stylists aren't very friendly, if they are busy they don't know how to figure out wait times or offer suggestions of what might work for them. This happened on several occasions I attempted to get a haircut, I just stopped bothering at this location.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>I got a voucher from groupon so I called before coming in to make an appointment for a haircut but the lady told me that I could just do walk-in. Went there, saw a couple people before me so I decided to check-in assuming that the waiting list isn't that long but later on, a few people came in and I found out that they had appointments so I had to wait for more than an hour. My stylist, Rosie, did a pretty decent job with my haircut tho so the star is for her. If I didn't have the voucher, I won't go here. Never again.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Haircut was ok. What I could not stand was listening to the stylists personal situations, clothing and eating habits. I go to get my hair cut. Light mutual conversation is appreciated. When the conversation is only about the stylists personal issues it becomes uncomfortable. I will not go back.< /Review></record>

Walked in and sat down. The two ladies working did not say hi. They gave me weird high school looking me up and down vibes. So I left. I don't want a HC by women who are in a bad moods.</Text>

If I could give less than one star I would. This establishment is completely unprofessional. The manager working there is so rude, degrading and racist. She completely ignored my elderly 70 year old grandmother when she came in to complain about one of the establishments hair dressers completely messing up her hair then had the audacity to tell her very rudely I might add too, that it was her fault for choosing that hair cut. She's 70 years old! Have some respect & understanding. And then after my grandma & I were leaving she slammed the door in our face after refusing to fix my grandma's hair. Will never go back to this establishment again with this kind of unprofessional, extremely rude management running the business.<//Text>

<text>Got mine and my husband’s haircut yesterday at this place. Adriana did a very great job. I went there with a superlong freezy unmanageable hair. Came out with so much of confidence and happiness. She understood my needs and did not rush it through the end. She chopped all the freezy hair and gave beach curly looks, which I loved a lot. Adriana you rocked it.< /text>< pics>

<Time>1518375010134< /Time><text>7E2-20B: Went there few more times since the first visit. Those visits were normal and I got good haircuts. Also, I like their coupons which come in the weekly grocery ad mails. Based on this I changed the rating to 4 stars.
First visit (1 star): Went there around 4pm and they close at 5pm, but they told me they are not taking any more customers for the day. Store seemed empty to me. I went to another store in the area and got the haircut.< /text>< Rate>

<Review>ABSOLUTELY WORST place EVER to get a haircut!!! I went in earlier this afternoon for them to trim my bangs. Worst bang trim ever!!! She was super lazy! She made my bangs look in between straight across and side-swept. The part that is supposed to look straight is completely crooked! Looks as if though she used a lawn-mower. Never going back there again that's for sure. And she's the manager there! Even worse! You make the rest of your salon look bad. And learn how to properly chew gum. You and your hairstylists look like damn cows!!! I'll make sure not to refer anyone there. That's a promise!!!</Review>< pictures>

I showed up to my appointment and they told me it would cost an additional $45+ to color my hair. Which is close to the cost of the groupon that I already purchased. Might as well pay the extra cost and go to a professional who won't charge you more money.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The place was pretty full when we got there. Needed a quick bite and my expectations were fairly low. Food was okay, a little better than I expected as I imagine it was really more of a drinks spot. Service could have been better, but wouldn't say it was bad. Overall would stop in again if I needed to eat something, but wouldn't go out of my way to get a meal here.< /text>

<review>Like the place. It is clean in there. There is a good choice of burger and salad. Nice presentation. Service was excellent, the beers at the bar are good and they offer multiple type of drought. It can be very noisy in the evening.</review>< pics>

The sandwich I had was fine. The staff seems to be stretched thin. I found the prices for the area to be a bit much.</Text>

< Review>
I've been wanting to try this place forever. It look so nice outside and super fancy. I'm thinking to myself yessss a reason to dress up for dinner. So. Guys. Ready? Boyfriend surprise me here for dinner. I was soooo excited. As we walked in. We waited five minutes to be seated. We sat all the way in the corner, and there were probably four tables that night. So empty *hmmmm*
I ordered the spaghetti with no meat sauce. And I could of swear to you that it was Prego brand sauce. No joke!
I asked for napkin. He came out with brown paper napkins for me. Like really? This is a wine, white cloth fancy place and you come out with brown paper napkins? Okay.
The waiter was so slow. I was annoying and kept asking the bust boy for water. He was more helpful than our actually waiter. So sad.<//Review>

<Text>What kind of sports bar doesn't have NBA League Pass?! ... I went in here and at first they told me they wouldn't put my teams game on, even on one of the little tiny TV's! I did a little begging and they agreed to do it, but came up empty because they didn't have the game available... SERIOUSLY ...these people have "Sports Bar" in their name but don't buy the completes sports packages!?!?< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>(Translated by Google) When I tried to go to the store in the hotel by using Google Map, I had a hard time going to the registered point. It was on the south side of Parcel 104.

It's a store inside the hotel, so it's expensive, but the volume is quite large and I'm full. It was delicious.
I ordered a burger and beer, and the burger had a lot of potatoes. The size of the burger was about how to eat it.

The clerk is also friendly, should I cut it? He suggested. It was good to spend a relaxing time while chatting.
Beer is $ 9, burgers are $ 18, sandwiches are $ 20. The two of us paid a little $ 60 including tax and $ 70 with a tip.

Google Mapをたよりにホテル内にある店に行こうとしたら、登録されている地点がおかしく行くのに苦労しました。Parcel 104の南側にありました。

ホテル内にある店のため、それなりに高いですが、ボリュームはかなりあってお腹一杯になりました。美味しかったです。
バーガーとビールを頼み、バーガーはポテトが大量についてました。バーガーもどうやって食べようかというぐらいのサイズでした。

店員もフレンドリーで、切ろうか？と提案してくれたりしました。歓談しながらゆったりとした気分で過ごすのにはよかったです。
ビールは9ドル、バーガーは18ドル、サンドイッチは20ドル。二人合わせて税金込みで60ドルすこし、チップいれて70ドルを支払いました。</Text>< pictures>

<review>(Translated by Google) It's hard to eat french fries because I think it's a waste to leave food (laughs)
I ordered steak sandwiches and Guinness, but the taste and volume were satisfying. In the atmosphere of the store, when there is a football game broadcast, it will be exciting.

食べ物を残す事は勿体ないと思ってしまうので、フライドポテトを食べるのが大変（笑）
ステーキサンドとギネスを注文したが、満足の味とボリュームでした。店の雰囲気だとフットボールの試合中継などがある時には、さぞかし盛り上がるのではないでしょうか。</review>< pictures>

Being a new business owner can be so stressful and after trying several other companies I was at my wits end!  Luckily I found Julie Anne with InstaBoost and could not be happier!! She is prompt, incredibly helpful, and able to do what I don't understand how to do without getting frustrated with me!   I recommend her to everyone!  She truly is amazing!!

Ms. Caringal and Instaboost have been excellent to work with. I have spent many thousands of dollars over the years trying to find someone who could help with website design and internet marketing, and in my experience most companies are eager to take your money but fall down when it comes to customer service and follow through. In contrast, Ms. Caringal answers her phone, or if she's busy she returns calls in a prompt manner. She has been very responsive and has diligently followed through to accomplish what we were trying to do.</review>< Gmap_id>

The next day, Daniella my account manager understood how detailed, thorough and aggressive I wanted to be towards targeting my exclusive geographical franchise zone areas. I've seen immediate results. Although, I just started working with Daniella she has great customer service habits and easy to work with. I'm looking forward to working with her for a long time. Making my company available for customers to find me causes my phone to ring. That increases my opportunity to increase my ROI. Love it!!!< /text>< Pics>

Lauren has shown outstanding customer service towards me! Not knowing much about the process of things like this, she took it into her own hands to educate me personally and bring my account to a place that I was investing in and has kept up with me personally during the process. Can’t say enough good things about her!!<//Text>

Instaboost Media did exactly what they promised they would do for our business. We purchased our business this year and had so much incorrect data floating around the web. Instaboost cleaned up our data, provided accurate information by merging Google pages, provided an immediate customer review page and helped us gain a great online presence! It was well worth the monthly expense to see the results we gained!! Thanks to everyone at Instaboost!! We’re so pleased with your product!< /Review>

Navigating the waters of online listings is challenging for a small business owner.  Instaboost was able to take care of this for me and make sure my presence online was consistent on all platforms, even on some that I didn't know existed. You can trust that they will do a great job for you too!< /review>

Hundreds of dollars spent the first few months produced no results for my business. This lead to Instaboost decreasing my monthly rate which was swiftly followed by them reducing the rate even more--to FREE!--because they had managed to increase my ranking by 0 in 4 months. This despite their 90 day guarantee for TOP 10. Five months later (so 9 months with their "service") I'm still not ranked at all. I've finally cancelled but absolutely feel like they took my money and ran. Reps were always pleasant so just know what you're getting into.</Review>

Billing via my bank account continued 4 months after my contract was terminated formally by email.  This company provided minimal services, staff kept changing and very few services were provided.  The staff do excell at smooth talking but they never really say anything except how great they are and how much  help they are providing. I do not recommend this company to anyone!</text>

I generally wait to write a review until after all services have been rendered, however, I am so happy with everything despite the issues we have all had with google that I feel very comfortable writing a review.

To begin, I have had the pleasure of working with Chris Baker and Suegene. Both are excellent at what they do. Chris is definitely a master of his craft and is one of the few individuals that can talk with an engineer and explain everything to a buying party. I have found that to be very rare. He leaves no stone un-turned and works very hard to offer you the best options. If he disagrees with you, he also gives you relevant advice on why you shouldn't follow through with your idea and substitutes a worthy replacement along the way.

Suegene (on a recorded line) on the other hand is out of this world. She is such a beautiful person and takes her time. I can not recommend her enough. What you are not told is that the process of building a website always takes a lot of time. So make sure you have an upbeat, detail oriented and sweet person helping you out. If she doesn't know the answer to something, she will let you know and she will find out. She is early on calls, easy on the phone and a pleasure to work with.

Between the experience I have had with both Chris and Suegene, I can personally vouch for the extraordinary level of service you can come to expect with Instaboost. In fact, make sure you request this dynamic duo as they made a tumultuous process an absolute cake walk.</review>

<text>It brings me great pleasure to share what a wonderful experience I’ve had working with Instaboost Media Google, particularly with Cynthia and Logan.

When I first spoke with Cynthia I conveyed to her the importance of not missing scheduled appointments with me as I’ve had this experience with other individuals in the past and found it quite disruptive to my business. She made it a point to always keep her commitment with me and give me a call at the appointed time. She also is a great communicator which made it easy for us to get things accomplished together.

When Logan was then assigned  to me I was disappointed because I really wanted to stay with Cynthia given our track record together. However,  I can say Logan was every bit as attentive and pleasant and a great communicator and I’ve really enjoyed working with him as well.

I’ve seen my presence on the internet broaden and I’ve been seeing more clients in my door.

Thank you Cynthia and Logan for all your hard work and being the stellar professionals at what you do!

Rock, rock on!!

<Text>Very kind and diligent individuals. But after 3 months I was still ranked 25-30 in my area for my industry. I voiced this concern 2 months and they convinced me to keep going since they had a 3 month guarantee what they failed to mention is that when they do not fulfill that guarantee they do not reimburse you what so ever. Instead they offer free service until they do get you higher on Google. So several hundreds of dollars in, I stopped using their services. Theirs no use in using a service that doesn't work; even if its free. Kind people, who seem hard working; but a company needs results. Nearly 1,000.00 spent on nothing with a half-hearted guarantee is definately disappointing. I had started using other forms of marketing at the same time which have proven to be much more effective.< /Text>< Pics>

We have been very pleased with the level of service we receive from our Instaboost team. Chris is our campaign manager and he really pays attentions to details, listens carefully to our goals, and then puts his entire team to work to not only accomplish those goals, but to far exceed them. As a roofing contractor in a hail-prone area, the level of competition is beyond high, to say the least, yet these folks never let us fall behind in our rankings. I don't write many reviews, but when a company shows this level of care towards their clients, a positive review is well warranted. Great job team!<//review>

This company has been amazing. I’ve been scammed by so called lead generating company’s numerous times. Not with instaboost media they have made everything extremely clear and understood. They appreciate the business you give to them by insuring that you are covered as well as informed.< /text>

I am not sure that you can find a more engaged and helpful team than the crew at Instaboost Media. The care that we have received from this team, and willingness to understand the results we are after have made our partnership effective and fun. I can't recommend Instaboost enough, especially for companies looking to expand their visibility, influence, and bottomline.</Review>

I'm a person that tells it straight, some like it some do not. After talking to both Lauren and Sway, I decided to let them both handle a few things for me. Let me tell you my bottom line has risen by 60-70 in the first 4 months, almost to good of a job. Instaboost, is essential to my business and my family's life style. THANK YOU, Lauren and Sway!<//Review>

Very Helpful and knowledgeable. Tamara was there to answer all my questions and connect me to Sway with my Google My Business page and Lauren Butler with my Google Ads campaign.

The three weeks since getting started with Instaboost Media call volume is definitely up.< /Text>

This is a terrific concept and the person running the program is easy to work with. He has helped many of our friends and associates greatly improve their web site as well as help us better understand the true concept of e marketing. We're always been reluctant to change but with Instaboost media we know great things are instore for us and for our networking organization. As the old saying goes, "try it, you'll like it."<//Text>

worked with Suegene that last couple of days to get my website going.  She has been fantastic and efficient and my page is now active and ready for the support team to start working with me.  She was very instructive in letting me know what was needed from me and what the Instaboost team would be doing.  Very good communication back and forth. Made the whole process very easy. Thank you Suegene</Review>

< Review>
Please be aware that management actively incentivizes monetary rewards for both google my business reviews, clutch reviews, and trustpilot reviews.

the employee's and regular workers of Instaboost Media are awesome people.

The management of this company however was created by a bunch of salespeople who left another SEO business, Local Lighthouse. Please be aware that management actively incentivizes both google my business reviews, clutch reviews, and trustpilot reviews. They also have an old yelp page that they changed to try and suppress previous bad review, called "Fast Rank Local"

additionally, a plethora of the reviews were fakely written to show that the business listing is "active".

Please note: company has created a private policy page that is subject to change at any time, therefore invalidating any sort of "contract" you sign with them, because if they don't agree with something they'll simple go change the contract to make it reflect their new view point. Employee's at this company are THE  BEST people, they work hard and truly care about the customer's business, however each project manager has over 160 accounts each and they're only incentivized to make calls to sell rather than work the account.

If you get a landing page or website created from IBM, please know that your website is created from 1 of 4 premade templates, and does not get set up with an Analytics campaign.<//Review>

To find  someone who knows exactly what he’s doing it’s a very difficult ,  I am advertising my business for the last 18 years and  I got disappointed so many times from people who was promised me and telling me a lot of stories
About how they can help me to put my business page in a good position online ,
Then two months ago I find Chris from Instaboost Media to try  to put my business page back online because it was suspended for miss correction,  it took Chris less than a week to verify the page with Google .
Chris is a very reliable guy always when I call or email him Hey respond right away !
I highly recommend it Instaboost Media for all online  Business needs !<//review>

<text>After receiving a call from instaboost I was initially skeptical considering they called me.  But after hearing the program I decided to try it and give it a shot.  I have been selling guitars for quite some time and relied on repeat business to get by.  I know I needed the help just wasn’t sure who to turn to since we get so many calls.  Anyways my account manager has been awesome, they have updated me on the whole process and so far I have had a great experience.  Since I am not to tech savvy I have no clue about this whole google thing.  Glad I found a legitimate company to help me.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>A representative finally got a hold of me to help me with my business page. (I tend to let out of state calls go to VM). After having TERRIBLE experiences with Yelp reps, I was hesitant to even take the call. Lauren Butler was who I spoke with, and I have to say, I’m kind of upset that she doesn’t live near me. She was an absolute pleasure to talk to, she was kind and straightforward, and I feel like we could be friends. I’d say she’s more than qualified to help, but her personality really sealed the deal for me. You’d be a fool not to work with her!<//review>< Resp>

<Review>Conner was very friendly and extremely helpful as I've been in business for 30 years but haven't had good and reasonable results from other online support services.
I know other business people and I will definitely pass the word along about Instaboost as well as my personal assistant Conner.

<Review>Over the past nearly two years, the crew at Instaboost Media has really had a huge impact on the attention that the website of our highly specialized company has received, going from no ranking and about 180 impressions per month, to the figures below, which we consider amazing.  Now, we feel confident in proceeding with a new Google "Ad Word" campaign, to refine the results even further!<//Review>< Pictures>

Aloha! I originally visited the office and met with Lauren. I have met with many SEO companies in shared office spaces like "We Works," and to me that seems very unprofessional. Instaboost's office was very professional and fully staffed. They had their logo on the walls. Instaboost gave me the confidence I needed by offering a written presentation and they presented my current local visibility. We analyzed the visibility and put together a strategy. My account manager is Suegene, and I am very happy with her as well. She is very responsive to my requests, and we have been going through a lot of changes, and she has been very flexible with us. Mahalo Instaboost Media.<//Review>

My  practice would literally not exist if not for Instaboost.   Without a bit of overexaggeration , they are life changing!   As I said in previous reviews,  my life circumstances dictated I make a liveable,  stable  income .  I am. I am because of my campaign. Thank you Instaboost  Profoundly .

<userid>106754253113351426347< /userid><review>Wow, I don't ever really leave reviews but this company is something else. I would stay away. It's seems the people leaving 5 star reviews are new people who have signed up and are hopeful but have not been with Instaboost Media thru their "guarantee" time frame or they don't know how to operate google business. Here's how it went for us:

We received a call saying there was a discrepancy in our google business account and that we could pay them to fix it. We said no thanks, we would fix it ourselves (which we did). Then they scheduled a call to say they could help us with our SEO which I was interested in hearing more about. We were ALREADY RANKED TOP 3 IN OUR CITY, but they said they would get us in the top 3 within a 50 mile radius and there was a guarantee involved so we decided why not. We went to cancel the 1st month bc our visibility actually decreased. They told us to give them 3 months because it takes SEO a while. We decided to give them a shot. By month three, we still were not getting the reports showing changes they said they were making so we called to cancel and brought up their "guarantee". (see image of actual email that produced 0 reports despite our requests for reports).

It was like a switch went off with them the minute you mention a guarantee and they began to have a temper tantrum like a toddler.  They cancelled our account without our consent, even tho we technically paid until the end of this month and told us to just dispute the charges with our bank bc they were not going to work on our account anymore if we were going to cancel anyhow. That was just the start of their un-professionalism.

Then, here's the best part; they have an employee or supervisor who will go to your business page and leave your business a fake 1 star reviews to hurt your business which btw is called SLANDER and very illegal. How do we know it was them? For 1: we don't work in California nor do we have a deposit from this person 2. We researched the guy who left the review and found he was associated with Christian one of the co-owners of Instaboost Media. The other Co-owner is chris which I was surprised to discover since he was the one throwing the temper tantrum and cancelled our account. So save your money, and find a legit company if you need help with SEO. They talk a big game but don't produce.

Update: Since taking back over our google business account and removing them from our google  access our exposure has increased over 900%. They literally did nothing for us. The only positive was that Sway seemed like a nice guy and was friendly. Save your money and find a college kid to help you! Hope this information helps someone.< /review>< rate>

I have been taken advantage of numerous times from several different companies and never had anything done. Connor from Instaboost not only got me going but created a Web page that I can keep. Most places only let me have it for 2 years Max and then try to charge me again. I was seriously about to cut all computer advertising out of my budget until Connor called. He has done everything he said he was going to do and more.</text>

CHRIS is the real deal!! I'll tell you from over 10 years of experience dealing with these so called " Marketing " companies and INSTABOOST MEDIA media is THE REAL DEAL! CHRIS and his team are prompt, transparent and are ACTUALLY there to support and help you each and everyday if need be. I would recommend these guys to anyone other than HVAC contractors because they will steal some of the business Instaboost has given to me   business at Nice and Cool Inc.<//Review>

I run a excursion boat in a Northwest Florida Destin Fort Walton Beach area we do dolphin watching, sunset cruises, crab island excursions and sunset tours last year towards the end of my season I was very flustrated with the lack of calls I was getting I Received a call from Stephanie at insta boost media and she was very helpful and knowledgeable When she 1st told me about their services I was a little skeptical but the proof is in the Pudding since that partnership started my phone is literally ringing off the hook and my my calls and bookings have quadrupled since last year so I highly recommend insta boost media for all your advertising needs whatever industry you're in I'm in the tourism industry and it works really well<//review>

I get Robocalls from this "Google Partner" at least 2x a week.  There is always a problem with my Google listing where it is not optimized, not claimed, going to be delisted, etc. As soon as I let them know that I am a Trusted Google Photographer, they hang up.  Finally let them go through the whole pitch and got to money part when someone finally gave me the company name.  Very misleading in their marketing.<//review>

You MUST work with CONNOR STEWART! He has a FANTASTIC energy and is 100% dedicated to YOUR experience and success with optimizing your business with INSTABOOST. I love how straightforward he was. Not salesy AT ALL! He saved me hundreds of dollars in time, money, and energy, that I could have spent on the wrong services, companies, or people. For instance, he saved me hundreds of dollars per month and thousands per year to stop the Yelp service I was paying for that he was able to integrate into my existing InstaBoost account AND add Google Places and Plus. He and others at the company just want to see you succeed and get more visibility as a business online- and that is why I give these guys 5 STARTS!</Review>

<review>Insta Boost Media is Awesome. They are not like your typical company.  Almost 99% of online marketing companies you call these days don’t have a one on one rep that helps you throughout your journey with them. It’s  close to impossible to get the same person you initially set up your account with on the phone.  It’s frustrating trying to do business with a company when your dealing with half their staff.  At Insta Boost Media you work hand n hand with one Particular representive that is there for you whenever you have questions. Sheryl at Insta Boost is a pleasure to work with, she’s prompt at getting back to you and is very knowledgeable of the services they offer. You can’t go wrong with Insta Boost Media. They will get your online rankings up quickly.<//review>< Pictures>

Extremely unprofessional. They keep calling my business harassing me every time from a different phone number with a recorded message and even after I talked to no less than 5 of their agents asking them to take me off the calling list. Finally I got the name of the company and found a legitimate phone number and I spoke to them about the issue they hung up on me. If you have a business and looking to improve your listing this should be the last company to choose.</Text>

<review>Spoke to Chris Baker and he helped me get my google page on verifed. Prior to Instaboost Media I've signed with 3 to 4 other SEO companies before and they couldn't ever get my page verified. I'm already on the front page for classic limo Mississauga and Rolls Royce limo rental Mississauga.</review>< Pics>

<text>The park itself is nice. But good luck trying to find it using Google Maps or anything else unless you know where it's at it's almost impossible to find. Good luck< /text>< pics>

Fallbrook youth baseball field and Ingold sports park is always confusing, and it is hard to find.  You have to search for Ingold sports park. They both are same, unfortunately  but little apart with in a big field and not walkable.

This is a large sports complex with small parking spots. No restrooms available but found a porta potty.

Great for kids and for the spectators.  Beautiful drive tho this field,  make sure you know where you are going before you leave,  tricky to find thia spot.

4 fields, nicely maintained with dirt and real grass.

Good luck finding it.< /Review>

<Text>So, this place is always packed! It's super tiny and the Cerritos Triangle where is located in is always  full. The is underground parking, but the lot is so small for the amount of traffic it gets. I only go here once in a blue moon. There's always a line in order to get in BUT, I'll give it to the staff they're so efficient and polite. Also, the staff gets your order out pretty quickly. A better and bigger location would be nice.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Recently went here for first time. We literally walked in 5 minutes before closing. I was expecting them to be impatient with us because they wanted to go home but was so pleasantly surprised that they were very welcoming and made helpful suggestions. The best part: the product actually looked like the photo!</review></record></dataset><record>

<rate>4</rate><text>Okay experience, but wishing it was an  average one. Was trying to order one of the Blizzard flavors that were displayed in the store but was told they now charged extra for it because it was a flavor that they no longer have. Not sure why they still have it advertised in the store if it is not on the menu any longer. So I ordered the Oreo, Mocha, Fudge Blizzard and it was half melted before I got 1/2 way into it. I guess that was why the employee didn't hold it upside down like they usually do. Anyways, tasted good but threw a 1/3 of it away because it was melted. I am glad they are somewhat inexpensive because of this. Guessing it will be time to find another location for my fix.</text><Name>Chris B Griffiths<//Name>< pics>

It’s sad, how does that old adage go, you can never go home again. One day I got to reminiscing about the Orange Julius in Lakewood mall. And found that DQ has Orange Julius’ so I took the drive. To our local DQ. It was ok but not what I remembered. A bit on the flat side. Like a reduced portion of the Julius powder. Anyhow- my daughter loved her blizzard and the fact that cashier flipped the treat upside down. The COVID precautions were excellent and the cashier was great. 👍🏼👍🏼</Text>

Went there before, great product. Went there again, got turned away along with several others. The worker said they were closed at 9:30. There is no record of early closures online or at the entry as of this review. The neon light was still on and we did see at two other people be let in after we got back in our car. If this is just a misunderstanding of current policy, please post online prior or let employees post a notice on the entry door. Will return again as this is only issue I’ve had.</text>

I can’t believe I am taking the time to write a review about this place; however, I feel like I have to write about it for others.

When first walking in, I was not greeted and by the looks of it, the employees haven’t been taking care of the dinning room to the mess on the floor. I then noticed the trash cans completely filled above the top of it.

I’d thought I’d give it a chance because looks can be deceiving, right? Well I guess in this case, my judgements were right.

The young fellow male on the cashier, was ignoring the customers in front of us and messing around with his hair. He then proceeded to take their order and make their food, without hand washing. Way to skip sanitation and food laws of California!

When I was up next, he took my order without any excitement. I understand this may be your first job or you hate working, but it’s all about the experience. Trust me, I live about 15 minutes away from this location and I much rather drive to Arcadia, which is about 40 minutes without traffic, just to go to the next DQ.

Feel sorry for the GM because it reflects on them since it is their store.

Won’t be returning anytime soon or maybe it’s just this night crew that hates their work? But not worth coming here.<//Text>

Slow, bad service.  They take forever and are disorganized.
Go to frostbites instead for better customer service.< /text>

Small dairy queen, closest to Los Angeles compared to all other DQs, although still 30 minutes away (with some late night traffic). Has seating indoors including high top tables, blizzard was not blended all the way through which was mildly disappointing as we had paid for extra stuff to be in it. But otherwise, standard dairy queen and very clean.< /text>

< Review>
I went in tonight to get a few Blizzards and Ice Cream cake. I grabbed the ice cream cake and got in line with my friends. We ordered our Blizzards and my friend picked up the tab. The cashier walked away to make them and I set the ice cream cake on the counter waiting to pay. Another employee walked out and rung me up and I stepped aside.

The original cashier returned and asked me if I paid for the cake which I responded yes. This started her interrogation of me. I told her I turned down the receipt, showed her my phone with the $16.99 charge on it. She asked one employee, not the one that helped me if She rang me up and she said no. I showed her my receipt was still on the receipt printer but she was still not happy. Luckily the employee that rang me up returned from the back and confirmed my purchase and I was not stealing.

After being convinced by a coworker to apologize she did, but seriously there are much better was to handle situations like this. I love your desserts but the training needs ramped up and the attitude turned down.< /Review>

<Review>This is a mom and pop owned dairy Queen complete with the two daughters working hard behind the counter. The owner is a great neighbor and every Wednesday night they have a free antique car show.

Of course they feature all your favorite DQ treats as well as burgers and the like. Give me a Hawaiian blizzard and I'm one happy puppy. The place is neat and clean and I always like going here as they are very friendly.

Enjoy!</Review>< pics>

The service is slow when there are too many people but the customer service never drops. The cashier is friendly and focused on the I dividual, making that experience of DQ great.  One thing that didn't work too well was the upside down ice cream promise. I held it over my head for 2 hours in 100 degree heat and it fell out the cup, 🤔, not sure if its me or not.<//review>

Table was clean

The only negative:  parking  ... but that's not their fault; but part of the experience.

I will definitely return, and surely would recommend.</Text>

No one said anything about downloading your app to get the buy one cone get one free today for first day of summer deal! Info was on news channel and on facebook, neither place said to download anything. Was told we needed some barcode? Cerritos store. I told the kids working tonight to put out a sign saying that. Kid working got in at 5pm, didn't know anything about it. Owners should have mentioned info to employees.< /Text>

While there may be more trendy places for sweet frozen treats sometimes it's good to go back to the basics. You can get a good blizzard or sunday here and there's not usually a long line of hipsters to deal with. This location is very nice with big windows that make it feel very airy and open. The staff is always pleasant and seem to get my order right every time.</Text>

< Review>
The cashier associate gave me a friendly greeting as I approached the register. The associate was not able to answer coupon questions about qualifying items. The associate was not able or unwilling to suggest or list any popular menu items or flavors. The associated pointed a general direction when I asked about sizes and price difference. I felt uncertain about my order choices, how much my total would come to, and whether or not I was getting the best choice for my money. I was not told any specials or upsold.

There was one person in the order line when I entered the line and only one register open, this cashier associate both taking orders and charging. After I placed my order, the line was coming out of the door.

I was satisfied with the taste of the items I ordered but would have choosen different had I known what flavor ice cream was used to make one of my chosen features. It would have been helpful for there to be ingredients listed under dessert names on the menu board. I also would have felt more at ease and secure with my selection had the associated been more knowledgeable about the menu items, asked me questions and offered suggestions for menu items. As, the menu was extensive and a bit overwhelming when I did not see an item I was hoping to find.</Review>

Was not to estacic about my recent visit. I’ve been going to this Dairy Queen for years. Didn’t like my blizzard ask for another they said no then asked fir a refund then they said they’d give me another one. Barely put in toppings in it. I don’t get what the big deal was to remake a small blizzard.

Edit: I have since returned and had better experiences. It really is disheartening when a business you been frequenting for years gives you a bad experience . Nevertheless it was one experience of many satisfactory ones</Text>

Of course they feature all your favorite DQ treats as well as burgers and the like. Give me a Hawaiian blizzard and I'm one happy puppy. The place is neat and clean and I always like going here as they are very friendly.

Enjoy!< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Who doesn't like Dairy Queen.  I like their ice cream, but unfortunately everytime I go to this place it seem to be a bit dirty. the floor is dirty and  some of the tables are sticky.  A time or two i had to asked to be wipe down.  at time.  Staff seem to be friendly enough,  but again most of the staff seems to be young that they're there for the paycheck and don't care about the costumer nor the place.    2 ☆☆</text>

Great place for ice cream treats. I love DQ and this one is overall great. My favorite thing is the Blizzard and I enjoy trying new flavors/combinations. The staff here is friendly and efficient. The parking can be tough on weekend nights due to neighboring club/restaurant so be prepared to wait a few minutes or drive around the lot a bit to find parking. If there's one complaint I have about this DQ it's that their medium size blizzard is never fully mixed. There is always about an inch or so of the soft serve vanilla at the bottom. It seems like by now DQ should have perfected the Blizzard making process so that it would all be mixed equally, but after many visits, it's always that way. After you eat a bit, you have to try to mix it yourself with the flimsy plastic spoon. Doesn't stop me from coming back though. This is a great DQ with a great staff!</review>

The Lacto-King visits the Dairy Queen for some Orange Julius.

BOGO coupon for Original Orange Julius or Smoothies.

Back in the day, I remember Los Cerritos Center had an Orange Julius.  This was when the mall had a Time Out arcade, a trashy UA Twin theater, a Woolworth and a piano/organ store.  I was uber cool, with my Stussy apparel, sunglasses with straps and velcro Pro Wings.  Can't forget the Sun-In in my wavy locks, either ;p  In all my years walking up and down the mall, I never had an Orange Julius.  Was I missing something?  Was my life incomplete?

Opening up my inbox and finding a BOGO coupon,  I found another bucketlist moment - Try an Orange Julius.

Dairy Queen is across the street from Los Cerritos Center.  Besides the usual DQ faves such as Blizzards, hamburgers and dogs,  DQ also sells Orange Julius products.

I ordered 2 large original Orange Julius'.  I asked the employee if it's like Orange Bang.  He didn't know what Orange Bang was (really?), so I slipped on my food critic hat and had my first sips of this frozen, sugary concoction-
Orange Icee is what came to mind.  The texture was smooth, it wasn't overly sweet and was quite refreshing on this warm day.  Like Orange Bang?  No, unfortunately.  Orange Bang is whipped, frothy and just that much more better.  The price was good, though.  Using my BOGO coupon, the damage including tax was $3.80.  Not too shabby, frugal one!

Service was good, as I chatted fruit trees and Indian food with the employee.  I owe him a Chico tree seedling ;p

The place was clean with tables for seating.  The blenders are going non-stop, so not a place to catch up with a friend or get some studying done.  The parking lot is a little on the small side.

Of course, the ice cream is what people go to DQ for.  I'll be back, moreso for a Blizzard or ice cream  than another Orange Julius.

Recommend!
