<Text>OMG the Roast Beef sammy!  Have had it twice now, and it is fab.  Hot, with melted provolone, on a simple white roll.  Medium is big enough to share.  Amount of beef on this sandwich is INSANE.  Go get one!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>I’ve had two meals at this place and it is pretty great!  The atmosphere is great, the smells as you walk in the door gets you salivating, and their are plenty of sports games on all over the place.  Ate outside one time and inside the other.

Breakfast Sandwich:  I love when places serve breakfast all day.  I was excited.  The sandwich was however very average.

Açaí Bowl:  second time I got this and loved it!  The açaí was a bit frozen on the bottom so difficult to mix, but was still amazing.  The granola was so good as well as the fruit on top.  Highly recommend this dish.

The tv in the booths didn’t seem to have a way to change the channel, so we were forced to watch golf, it’s better to talk to each other anyways haha<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0wIw5WJBnFhavEDHdzk-Dc-yqUmHs19aeozQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSCHHjZ9vMgSj41fNXnNK5Lah_08Lu4NFPtj8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1mDtmNwmA2_M4BGhmu5QcAYOAsHyKeZuSrdM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><name>Keith Hubert<//name>< Gmap_id>

Absolutely loved this place I went back on several occasions during my trip to oceanside. Delicious food with reasonable prices and very friendly staff. The atmosphere was relaxing and peaceful and the Deli itself was clean. Its also in a great location if you want to take your food to the beach. Would give more than 5 stars if possible!<//Review>

The food and the beer is good, but every time I go in there, one of the managers or owner I always sitting there drinking a beer or whatever, playing video games. And usually about two or three people hanging out with him. Far as I'm concerned it's bad business. And for some reason when a nice little Deli like that should be busy it's empty.</text>

< review>
Came here for the first time with a buddy after a relatively long bike ride. In other words, I was starving and, if required, would do anything for food at that point. I ordered the cheesesteak sandwich, which comes open face, and a tall Coors Light (yeah, I know Coor's Light, but it was hot day and we were on bikes so it was perfect). My buddy claimed they only serve beers in liters. Whether he was lying to me or not, I still opted for the giant beer mug.

Anyways, back to the food. As I mentioned, I was starving and - sure - I would have eaten almost anything. BUT I honestly can say that this sandwich was simply amazing. The meat was tender, the bread was delicious, the cheese was melty ... it just worked. I don't live in Oceanside but I can say that I'll be back. #Truth< /review>

I ate at the Beach Hut Deli in Oceanside recently and while I thought the food was alright, let me tell you what I witnessed from the owner of this place (who I found out is also the manager). While I was eating, I overhead the owner tell his staff to turn all the TVs on to the Donald Trump speech that was playing live on the news. Then he said "If any of you have a problem with listening to this on the TVs then you can quit, you are all completely expendable to me and I can replace any of you at any time no problem". Now, regardless of political affiliation, any owner who treats his hard working staff like this is trash if you ask me. His workers are the reason his business is able to operate as it does. To berate them at all like this, and especially in front of customers, is a total disgrace. Mind you, this was all completely unprompted as his staff changed the channels without any fuss. This owner is total bottom of the barrel trash and I hope you read this review and decide to take your money elsewhere.< /Text>

The sandwiches were fantastic and the lady behind the counter was very friendly! You can get you sandwich either warm or cold plus they have a pretty good selection of craft beer on tap! Perfect spot for lunch, apparently they also do breakfast but I jave yet to try it.</review>

<Text>I have never had a Pastrami Sandwich before, so I don't know how the "Reuben" from the Beach Hut Deli compares to others. But as far as Sandwiches go generally, it was absolutely fantastic. Fresh ingredients, fantastic flavors and very friendly staff. Everyone else in our group enjoyed their sandwiches, salads and drinks so a 5/5.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>You'll find an incredible variety of gourmet sandwiches, and an impressive variety of craft beers on tap here for you to procure. The staff are very well-versed in what you should try, and they are incredibly friendly so don't shy away from making conversation. The atmosphere itself brings out a great surfer chill vibe you can't help but notice and love. My go to is the Skinny Dipper Roast Beef Dip. They also have an amazing, strong cider that is always a favorite among the regulars and the staff.</Review><user_name>Fareed Ahmed</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Living 10 years in Oceanside, I have visited most of the new establishments and make them my regular stops for a while. The Beach Hut is my new stop because it is the best combination of friendly atmosphere, lots of light, great beers, great food, and great TV viewing for sports. The arc bar creates the setting for lots of fun exchanges with strangers.<//Text>

They have no pricing for any beer. Very disrespectful and uncomfortable to have to ask. I don't understand the big secret. Remember this is oceanside not La Jolla.< /Review>

While vacationing @ Wyndham Oceanside Pier,  Oceanside, California. While walking we stopped and ate Beach Hut Deli.

On a walk or on the way back from the ocean I would recommend you stop in a eat a sandwich and get a drink.

Great sandwich! The staff made the order wrong, but they went above and beyond and made it right! Nice to see a place that is humble enough to do the right thing with out even being asked.

<text>Awesome place. All the employees were super nice and cordial, and even remembered my name as I walked out of the restaurant. Super chill vibes, great location, awesome patio and cool bar. Tvs in every direction you look, and of course, they got bomb food. My wife and I grabbed some salads and they were delicious. It seems like they have a huge variety of different sandwich/salads, so it's basically everything you want out of a deli. And 200 feet from the beach? Sold. I'll definitely be coming back here, no doubt about it.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Wonderful and friendly staff with the best sandwiches I’ve had anywhere. Plenty of great beers on tap, as well as a really fun and inviting environment. Rieley Mettler must be one of those unhappy-with-life annoying twits. You have TONS of options, as the staff here are happy to make your sandwich exactly as you prefer. I highly recommend and have made it a regular dining spot.<//Review>< UserId.>

My favorite sandwich place in San Diego. They got a wide variety of sandwiches for everyone’s taste. They pack it In with meat and veggies.. They’re are not stingy. Prices are a tad high, but they serve liquor. And have a tv at every booth. Staff is friendly and keep place clean. So the value is worth it.<//text>

overpriced sandwiches way too salty of food This place did not appeal to me I mean that many deli restaurants many sandwich places many sub shops I review mall this place hands down it's all right in the pinch I guess but there are so much better places with such better prices This place is way over hyped way overpriced but when people are going to pay whatever they want to pay it's all about the niche market I guess.<//Review>

Since moving into Pierside we have eaten here nearly every day trying something different or just relaxing with a beer. Friendly and professional staff. Great food, great staff,  great craft beer on tap. Pierside residents can have their food delivered and enjoy an extended happy hour till closing.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>This is the best sandwich i have had in a long time. Roast beef, roasted turkey, ham, pastrami, salami, and tuna with all the fixings. Avocado was fresh AF. I got the santa barbera; comes with bacon like many of their sandwiches!!! Great beer selection, music, patio seating. Tvs that blend in with the decor and do not overwhelm you. If you want to watch you favorite sports team just ask and they will put it on for you!

I will be back very soon!!!</Text>< pictures>

<review>Wow. Just wow. Words cannot describe this place. Absolutely delicious and unique with that downtown  LA street food twist taken to the max. The entire vibe of the place screams Central LA. Everything from the decor to the loud 90s hip hop music is fantastically done to create a uniquely LA atmosphere.< /review>< pictures>

Very good tasting beers. Friendly bartender when we arrived. A unique, cozy place with a great laid back patio area. The wheel barrel seats are not comfortable but everything else is cool and functional.

A nice BBQ restaurant and wine bar is located onsite as well with plenty of seating and live music. A very convenient and accommodating area overall. This is why you get out of the house to socialize.< /review>

< Review>
Unsung is located right next to the packing district.  I've been coming here for years. Pre-COVID it was an awesome to hang out, drink a beer, grab a board game, and chill. Lots of cool decor inside from comics, star wars, and other sci fi. Beers are consistently solid, and I love the naming conventions that match the vibe of the place. I love supporting this place, and they have offered solid takeout options from 4 packs to different crowler sizes. Easily one of my favorite breweries in Orange County.<//Review>

Flew down from Texas for a couple days and stumbled upon this brewery and enjoyed every moment! I had the 'Chocolate Snowball' which was delicious and was served by a fellow Texan named Kara who made the visit very nice! The scenery was dope and the drinks were great! :)</review>

First time visit but I think we'll be back.

<Review>Beer was fine but the decoder price system was incorrect as shown. I ordered a Metaplex and was charged $8 for it according to the board it's $7 I was told that was "last year's price." it's September either fix it or don't and continue to charge $7. I feel petty on here griping about a dollar but if I point it out give it to me as advertised and just make your dollar off the unsuspecting victoms of lazy or false advertising.</Review><GmapID>0x80dcd6300e1fb2bd:0x189484a3bdc046fc<//GmapID><time>1569112497581</time><user>117085574805742260344</user></record>

<text>Great friendly atmosphere here, and the location has an abundance of room and seating yet still feels cozy. The wonderful lady behind the bar when my group went was a cicerone and was super knowledgeable about everything on tap. I had the 215 Parsecs IPA which was a great hazy brew, and I was introduced to milkshake IPAs with the Chug-a-Dub-Dub that was really smooth. Would definitely recommend taking a group here- when we went some of us got beer and some got wine from the winery next door, and we congregated in the common seating area between the two establishments. Long story short- there's something for everyone here and you'll find it conveniently across the street from the packing district which is a great location.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd6300e1fb2bd:0x189484a3bdc046fc<//gmap_id></record>

The beer is amazing here. Definitely worth the trip. They generally have a good selection of different styles all of which seem well done and worth checking out. Unsung themes their beers after comic characters that they have created, and the atmosphere inside reflects this too.

Parking in the area is terrible, but I can't blame the brewery for that.<//review>

Great beer and a great setting.  As well as the brewery, there's a winery adjacent, as well as a BBQ spot, and it looks like there's liquor coming soon.  There's a nice big gravel garden it front, with seats made from wheelbarrows!

The beer selection could be a touch bigger.<//Text>

<text>Cool atmosphere, pretty good beers. I liked their signature IPA. Only weird thing was that they don't really promote flights. You can only order 2 tasters at a time. When I am checking out a new brewery I like to be able to sample as many as I can.</text></record></dataset><record>

Nothing wins my approval like a brewery with a good wheat beer and a gaming day.  They also have drawing days. The venue is cute,  with parking available nearby. In the same location there's a nice wine bar and bbq place.  We want to come back soon.< /Text>

<text>Really good beers! Everything is super crushable. Also great atmosphere, they have board games and tons of seating. If you get hungry the packing house right next door has a wide gamut of food options. A quick 10 minute ride from the convention center. If you buy a growler you get a free comic book and if you bring your Blizzcon badge you get a $1 off your beer.</text>< rating>

<text>Great spot with great beers!  Awesome location by the Packing District.

On my first trip here I didn't know they only fill in stainless steel growlers. Lots of places advertise their growler fill policy on their website; it would be nice if they did this since they have one of the most restrictive policies on generic growlers. The only places that are more restrictive are the places that only fill their own, which are becoming very rare, thankfully!

If you want to bring your own growler for fills, it will need to be stainless steel. They "claim" the amber/dark glass growlers let in enough light to make their beer no longer taste right very quickly so they won't fill them.< /text>< name>

Great place for craft brews. Most very thing they brew is good. I like the super hero motif and they have great murals and art. You can get a free comic book when you buy a growler of beer. Definitely more on the "hip" side. Parking can be tough depending on time of day.</text>

Went to Unsung yesterday, 18 Oct. Andrew was pouring and Mark working with the small batch equipment. Both are interesting and spoke quite a bit with me.. was much appreciated.  Depending on my business schedule, I stop at any new breweries. Read about Unsung in local Beer paper . Was  mega surprised at their offering, the layout and total vibe of the room. Hats off to your vision and investment.

The main staple beers were awesome. I don't want to say what I lied so that more will be availabkle when I come by next.

I plan on making Unsung a regular visit.</review><Time>1476898586068<//Time></record>

<Review>I don’t recommend this place to anyone it changed a lot since last time I was there this new person doesn’t Not help seem like he’s only interested in selling phones at a very high plan to everyone ( I don’t know what happened to the 3 team members that’s use to work there very nice people and good customer service they need to put them back ) because this guy isn’t doing a very good job . Won’t be coming back here again & I don’t recommend it to anyone ( only reason am giving it a star is because it would not let me post this review without giving it a star</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

this guy seem nice , but didn’t want want to explain things to my grandma she’s an old lady that has been with boost mobile for a very long time just for him to not want to help her and tell here to call customer services if you aren’t willing to help than why are you doing a job that the main thing is to help customers<//Text>

I was overwhelmed with making the best decision that worked for me . Rosie help me find the perfect phone that best fits my budget. She was patient and helped me understand my phone plan as well as my new phone. I’m very happy with my purchase. This store has great customer service. I will definitely return to this store for future cell phone purchases. Thank you!</Review>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Text>Deal time furniture is TRULY the BEST furniture store my husband and I have ever been to! From the shopping experience to the actual buying- these people here are so patient, and take the time to make sure you go home 100% satisfied! My husband and I took 2 days in this store making our final decision for our sofa selection. Luis took the time for those two days... to measure and try to fit in every way possible,  to send us home with the large sectional we were hoping for- unfortunately, our living room is not made for it and WOULD NOT fit one. He helped us select the identical comfyness and color as the sectional- just in a sofa and love seat. We completed our purchase with the sofas, a coffee table set, and a dining set at an AMAZING PRICE! Not only is the product beautiful, but truly made to last. We are waiting on our sofas and coffee tables, as we only ordered them a few days ago. We are completely happy with this purchase, and cannot wait to have this beautiful furniture in our home!
Do not waste your time at other furniture stores that are only trying to make a quick sale, Go to Deal Time Furniture where you have so many options to select  in store or ready to order in a catalog- something that fits YOUR budget, and with great leasing options as well!<//Text></record>

Went to see about getting a mattress and BOOM!! Got better than what I was expecting for the price I planned on spending! The costumer service was great and very helpful. They shown us all available options and gave us the privacy we need to discuss amongst ourselves. We were able to make a decision without any hassle or push to purchase something we couldn't afford or didn't really want. We have our eyes on a sofa so needless to say, we will continue to do business here. Thank you again!!< /text>

They have great quality furniture with affordable prices as well as extended warranty. More personable than dealing with a huge company with a pushy salesman. I would recommend Deal Time for any furniture need rather big or small.< /Text>

< Review>
I got my daughter's bed set with them and they were amazing, they delivered on time when they said, and i love that he didnt pressure me to spend more then what i had set to spend nor did he pressure me to open credit. Therefore, i went back a 2nd time and this time i bought a dinning set, that they also delivered on time and since one of the chairs came out damaged from the packing they told me they were going to replace it so they dis not give me a damage chair they delivered the new chair the following week. I would recommend them to anyone and I will keep going back to them if i need anything else</Review>

Save yourself the head ache and look some where else for your furniture, we ordered ALL of our furniture for our new apartment (dining table, couch, bedroom set, coffee set tables, bedroom set dresser) out total was ok but only we didn't get the couch and we weren't aware until THE LAST MINUTE. Had to get out money back after pulling or leg for a hole buissnes day & buy another couch else where. The dining table wasn't build right I'm missing two or three screws. The bedroom set is the wrong style and color, & last The "Custom" dresser with a media "slot" is UNFINISHED with paint and all they did was remove the drawers and called it a big ass media slot! I emailed them and Joseph said he'd help with my situation only to tell me they're isn't nothing he can do about it & I can complain with the main owner who only speaks to you over the phone on speaker. So pretty much I'm screwed with the ugliest unfinished dresser that is literally missing drawers and looks UGLY.</review>< rate>

I came to Ice Bar for the first time because they close at “12:00am” and once I show up the shop was closed. Before showing up I tried calling them since 11:50pm to see if they were open but never answered the phone. I decided to show up since I live 3 minutes away and arrived at 11:55pm. The doors are locked but it seems like the employees are still there because there are several cars outside parked right outside the entrance and the lights on. This is very unfair for customers to be fooled with inaccurate closing times especially for new customers like myself. Very disappointed and recommend you guys to fix the closing time if the closing time is 11:00pm or 11:30pm.</text>
<pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1619890085789, 'text': 'Hi Luis,\n\nThank you for taking time to write us a review. We appreciate all customers feedbacks.\n\nOur closing time is at midnight every day. Sometimes we are too busy inside the store plus online pickup or thru delivery services, that’s why they didn’t have chance to pick up phone. However, our store entrance door is closed at exactly midnight. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We definitely address this issue to prevent it happen again in the future.\n\nAgain, our apologies and hope you still visit us in the future.\n\nRegards,\nThe Ice Bar West Covina'}< /response>< Gmap_id>

We had a day trip to Chino Hills State park and searched for a boba place to get drinks on the way home. Surprisingly, we found this place which we tried their other location in Northridge. This place is smaller, also clean and they haven’t allowed dine in yet. Cashier was friendly. We got Cheese foam matcha latte and Chamoy Mango which were very satisfied after a long walk in Chino hills.< /review>

Drinks are ok. Nothing special.
Mine lacked flavor but my friend's was good.
Honey boba is good.

<review>The Ice Bar has the greatest drinks I've ever, compared to a lot of places I've gotten drinks. The drinks are exactly as they are presented on the pictures while the flavors are top notch and made with care. This place is good enough to bring your grandma or someone feeling down to drink they'll love it! The Sunset Matcha Dalgona is by far the greatest Matcha I've ever had in my life.<//review>< pictures>

Iced teas, milk teas, and coffees are all delicious! My family loves this place too!

My go-to are the viet coffee latte, and the lychee Rose tea. Good stuff.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtJ0d9HqdjDeKzwuq9mEUbJSU00IuhQ28rOSMF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2d7d5269d769d:0x6ce6f6d751bc2029</gmapID></record>

The store smells a little weird though, like horseradish or wasabi. Just a note, prices are a bit more expensive if you order online from Yelp or Grubhub.</Review><date>1613629767446<//date>< user_name>

First time going here with my family, I order milk tea boba and it's delicious.
Staff service 5/5: the staff was nice to ask about signing up for the Square program. I like how they have a vibrating alert device to alert their customers that their drinks are ready to pick up.My first time seeing a boba place that have this feature.

Drinks 5/5: I ordered two Milk Tea with boba and the boba are chewy and warm. The drink isn't heavy in sweetness which is good. Not low on sweet nor high on sweet. So this would be great for anyone who are careful about their sugar level. The drinks are delicious.

Place 5/5: This spot is a good place to bring friends and family to hangout and have some drinks. Chill comfortable spot. Also this place has WiFi. Some customers work on their graphics design projects on their laptop, others do their homework, some play board games/card games.< /Text>

They have pretty interesting drink . The milk tea chocolate looks interesting that's why I get it . I never could understood how one tea is better than the other place but this one is worth the price I'm paying . Would definitely go to this place again at least to get this drink if I'm around.<//Text>

<text>OUTRAGEOUS!!! This place charges you an extra 0.55 cents to make your teas hot. Beware, It is a total rip off. Is not like they are adding more tea to the drink.< /text>< response>
{'time': 1584464517149, 'text': "Dear Karismaa,\n\nThank you for writing us a review. I just finished reading your review and appreciate you taking time to share your experience at our store.\n\nI'm really sorry about your disappointment about extra charge for hot drinks. For making a hot drinks, we have to use twice amount of teas compare to a regular cold drinks (with ice). We have to charge .55c more to cover the extra supplies cost on us. Thank you and have a good day."}<//response>

<Text>First, thank for staying open during the times indicated by your store hours even though there wasn't any business. SO many times I've driven to restaurants that are supposed to be open late but close early due to lack of customers .. So infuriating!

The owner served us and he was so patient in explaining our choices and what people usually like. I got the Korean pear with blueberry. They hand-squeeze the gel and use tweezers to put on each type of mint- WOW!  They make it look like an art form. It tasted like iced Korean pear, and the blueberry gave it more of a kick. They even had blueberries frozen inside! My favorite was the calpico gel though.. MmmMMm. It really tasted like calpico!

My boyfriend got the nutella and banana. It was REALLY good as well, and the sweetest bar they have (although it's not overwhelmingly sweet). So each bite consisted of this creamy banana, drizzle of nutella gel, and the crunch of the banana chips on top. REALLY good. And the banana tasted like a real banana, not some processed "fruit." We sampled the horchata ice cream too and it was so good as well. However, my dessert stomach isn't as big as my regular-food stomach, so I had to choose between ice cream or a bar.

BUT my boyfriend's dessert stomach is pretty big, so after getting his nutella and banana bar, he got one more. It was the mango and strawberry(?) one I believe.  It made my relive my lucas-eating childhood, where we would spend recesses trying to squeeze and eat all the lucas hairs out of those lucas containers. I really like how tangy this bar was, yet refreshing with the mango and strawberry base.

The décor is really cool and hip. I liked the color scheme and how the bar stools are situated at different heights pertaining to the wall décor. It gives off the same futuristic vibe as the ice cream lab. I KNOW this place is going to blow up soon, sooo come NOW before the line becomes regularly out the door!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I have been wanting to try The Ice Bar for quite awhile, and I finally was able to get the chance to try. While I think the bars definitely make a great photo-op, I don't think I would return often just because the prices are a little high and the location is quite far.

The storefront is very bright and welcoming. Lots of tables and chairs. The workers were friendly and explained to us the menu since we had never been to The Ice Bar before. You pick a pop, then choose if you want to eat it plain, in the way that The Ice Bar customizes it, or customize it yourself. There's different prices for each option.

I tried the Korean Pear Blueberry and Strawberry Lemonade House Style. Both of them were made in front of my eyes (ooh) and after taking a ton of pictures, I was able to try them both. They were interesting. I think the popsicle base reminded me of the ones I used to get from the street vendors or ice cream trucks when I was younger. But having all the fancy sauces and garnishes definitely give the popsicle base an extra kick. The Strawberry Lemonade was okay. I liked the Pop Rocks and the tanginess of the strawberry lemonade popsicle. I thought the Korean Pear Blueberry was much tastier. It was more refreshing and cool, a good treat on a hot day.

I think the total price was around $6-$7, a decent price for a first time ever gourmet popsicle experience. The popsicles were creamy and had good flavor, but I don't think I'd make the trip out to West Covina just to get an ice pop.

Just a side-note: check out the bathroom! The wall art is pretty cool :)</review>

(Translated by Google) Very scared 😭 Very scared 😨! It’s dark in the middle of winter, no body inside. I yelled 3 hello. No one answered. At this time, two women came in from outside, one with vicissitudes on their faces and the other with pale faces. Then the blue light of the neon advertising looked very... , I dare not wait any longer, the wind is strong! Damn it!

If I can give this place a 0 star I would for the service! My 15 year old daughter was ordering 2 bowls. I let her place the order so she can learn and be a independent person. The server [hispanic lady] was very rude  while my daughter was giving her the order and told the server to mix it up ...the server became very abnociois and was rushing her and  said next time tell me in advance if you want that. I told her relax, she's a kid and trying to learn how to place an order. Don't be rude and provide poor customer service! The server needs to learn how to provide customer service and be polite, patient and respectful.</text>

<Text>I haven't tried poke bowls until a couple of months ago. First time was in a place in Los Angeles and it was good. Then I found this one near my work place and I love it. It's always fresh and delicious and the ladies there are very nice. I've been at other places and not all of them put masago on it, but one of the places that I've been to, if I ask them to put some more masago (because I love it), the employees roll their eyes and add an extra tiny bit of it, like 1/3 of a teaspoon, but in here, I always ask them to put some more and they smile and put a lot more. I wouldn't mind paying more but their attitude is one of the things that make this place my favorite.< /Text><username>Ana Campos</username>< Rate>

This is my favorite poke spot! I also love the rewards program, buy ten bowls and get a small one free. I'm here so often that I've gotten plenty of use out of it. The fish and veggies are always fresh and the employees are so nice!!<//Review>

<username>hi people<//username><review>I haven’t been here in over a year and here’s why. I came here twice and the first time the food was very bad. I decided that I would give this place a second chance but that was a big mistake. The food was like the Sahara desert and it was very dry. The rice might as well be raw. I ate half of it and then threw it away. I wouldn’t even give the food to my cat.<//review>< Response>

Really good poke. Really good service. It's counter service only, no chairs or tables, but that's my only (minor) complaint. I'll definitely be back, chairs or no.</text>

<Review>The bowls themselves are pretty good, but they are more expensive than other poke places, and the service is a lot slower. Some of the employees are super friendly, and others couldn't care less about you or the job. If you're getting a bowl I suggest asking to put your order in a large bowl no matter the size. I also recommend having everything mixed together, including your base and sides.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>All About Poke is All About Poke...!!! Great, quality ingredients and no skimpy portions. I always choose a large bowl which gives you many choices of proteins and there's an abundance of sides, sauces and toppings... coupled by a friendly staff and many Polynesian cold drink choices...

The food was delicious and fresh, the staff was very sweet, and parking wasn't too bad. I can't complain about my experience, but one thing I noticed was the lack of seating. I got my food to go, so it didn't bother me too much, but ut may bother others.</Text>

<resp>None<//resp><text>Unfortunately the Upland Waba restaurant in my view needs supervision and help.  We have been going to Waba grills since their opening. Our order was wrong ,not following request such as wrong rice, not putting sauces on the side, no salad dressing, no soy sauce  etc. Also staff need patience, seem overwhelmed? We won't return to Upland. Waba, Will go to Ontario Waba. Is there an attitude higher up in this location since we have had better service in other Waba locations for years!</text>< rating>

<rating>2< /rating><date>1608465029855<//date><Text>Be careful to check your orders when picking from Online placement. The female  server handed out someone else order (tied up in a bag) on 12/19/2020 @ around 6:00 pm then lied when we called back. Saying that the wrong order was grabbed. It was not grabbed. It was handed out by her tied up in a bag. Why lie instead of admitting to a simple mistake?< /Text><GmapID>0x80c33140ec8442a1:0x69adb361ed7f5329< /GmapID><resp>{'time': 1609190511873, 'text': 'Major, we apologize for the customer service and the problems you had with your order.

Good portions and good food. The only problem is the bowls aren't big enough to hold all the food. I always have to empty the bowls out onto a bigger plate or into a bigger bowl just so I can eat my food and mix it together</Review>

<Text>I like this location. I've been to other locations and they are not good as this one. The staff is very friendly. I also like this place  because it's always clean. Smells clean too. There is a review that smell like fecal matter it's NOT true. It is clean. I've been to others and those are dirty and sticky from waba teriyaki sauce . Anyway, food is great. Restrooms are clean as well. Though ask for the code for the restroom. It doesn't offer multiple stalls. I recommend.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Usually clean, the employees are millennials, need I say more. Sorry kiddos I know there are great millennials but the bad rap came from too many skill-less, no eye contact, no affect, no social skill drips being part of your generation and it's my generations fault for not slapping ettiquitte into you. Food is done well here generous portions but the stinginess with the tereyaki sauce has got to stop, I spent 25 bucks on a two people and your going to be cheap with tereyaki.
Get some employees with people skills and a tereyaki pump and I'll give five stars...</Text>

(Translated by Google) I made an order online and the food was old ... the super-overcooked vegetables the horrible overheated steak the only thing more or less salvageable was the chicken and the person who served me shows that he doesn't like his job. In a nutshell very bad service.

VERY PROFESSIONAL and GREAT ATMOSPHERE!

When I went to my first appointment everyone at Metropolis Dermatology were not only helpful and professional, they were all very kind and warm. It was a great experience and I really appreciate Dr. Wang being honest with me about my options. I never felt pressured to get any additional procedures, pay for things I didn't want or rush into expensive treatments even when I was the one suggesting getting them. All around a wonderful experience and I can't wait to go again and see the results I achieve over the course of my treatment.

If you want to feel like your dermatologist has your best interest in mind I would go see Dr. Wang.<//review>

My view while waiting in the office! Super clean and so nice they even have a coffee maker and mini fridge filled with drinks. I didn't get a picture of my room but I wish I did the view was spectacular. Dr. Wang was great as well he answered all of my questions and made me feel very comfortable. I would recommend this office and look forward to coming in for my follow up visit.<//review>

<Review>Had an awful experience today at Metropolis. Called the office multiple times on Saturday during business hours with no one answering every single time - now there are two receptionists manning the desks. They cancelled my original appointment because the doc wanted to go on holiday. In being transparent I was 8 minutes late however.

Showed up and encountered Sofie, a not so inviting receptionist who I experienced a barrage of snappiness from. I asked if I could split my copay between two cards and the first rapid fire response was, "I don't know if that would work, but we'll have to see" in the most resistant tone.  I take a seat and worried that the extended wait time is going to drive up the parking fee I'd have to pay, I naturally asked Sofie how long she thought the wait would be despite my appointment being scheduled at a set time, but instead of being helpful, her first response was to point out that I was late and therefore I shouldn't have the audacity to wonder how long I'd have to wait even though I clearly have an appointment time that wasn't being honored. She then checked with the doctor and the response I got was more than 30 minutes, which wasn't acceptable to me.

Another embarrassing moment for this clinic was when I asked for a physical receipt for my records and the reply I got was a snap, "it's in your email" as though I was inconveniencing them for asking something that isn't an unreasonable ask. After stating that it wasn't an unreasonable ask, I was provided one with great agony. Clearly, staff training and organization is lacking with Metropolis. For the premium they charge, I highly advise others to take their business elsewhere as Metropolis doesn't measure up in my opinion. I couldn't stand the idea of having to come back after my consult so I asked for a refund and didn't bother with my consult.</Review>< Pictures>

However, to answer your concerns - Saturday clinics we opened to provide additional service to our patients outside of normal business hours, so we do have limited and separate staff and phone service so we apologize if we were not able to get your calls.\n\nRegarding the wait time, we do tend to run right on time, so we had to see the patient after you who was on time. We do not turn away late patients in general, but we do ask that they wait until the next scheduled patient can be seen. We of course would see anyone late as soon as possible after the next scheduled patient.\n\nFor paper receipts, we opt to be as paperless as possible, so our system is completely digital, from check-in demographics and questions to receipts and prescriptions. We are glad that we were able to provide you with the paper receipt in the end.\n\nWe know you have choices when it comes to your skin care, so we do regret that we did not live up to your standards.

<text>I am so glad and happy I went to Metropolis Dermatology and am recommending it to my friends and family!  I previously saw a dermatologist elsewhere who didn't take my concerns seriously. I wanted my brown spots
on the right side of my face removed as they've been bothering me for some time. One that is a bit lighter and the other raised and near by eye. I had an appointment with PA Jeff Bonnaud who was so nice and very clear as he knew how best to remove them (which another office wouldn't, even with my request) including using a laser on the one near my eye.  Both have healed so well, I'm very happy with everything and the whole experience including being open on the weekend! The appointment was easy, the office and staff were so nice and helpful, didn't have to wait long at all once I got there, and even got a follow up call to see how I was doing!! While I was there I also wanted to address some other things including my moles and I couldn't be happier with the whole experience.  So grateful to find a great dermatologist and highly recommend this office to others!</text><rate>5< /rate><userid>116109073263982951960<//userid><Name>JONATHAN NGUYEN< /Name><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

<Review>Dr. Wang is very knowledgeable and has a great bedside manner.  Would happily recommended to anyone that needs a top notch derm.  Was able to quickly assess and clear up my skin issues and wish I had found him sooner!  Regardless, happy to have found him and appreciate his care.<//Review><UserId.>109147176508357073520<//UserId.><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< time>

I met Dr. Wang in April 2020, when there was a lockdown and he was one of the few who accepted in-office visits at the time. I was quite impressed by how polite, kind and understanding he was. He listened to me. However, when his proposed treatment/moisturizers did not work out, he quickly gave up on me. This left me quite disappointed and hopeless. Additionally, his services are super expensive (Follow up appointments were also being charged), I wouldn't mind that if he were to actually have helped me. I am sure he is a good dermatologist and based on most of the reviews I have seen, he is helpful. However, I have yet to find a dermatologist that truly cares and will work with you till the end - until he/she finds a solution and not quit halfway.<//text>

We do not give up on our patients and are sorry that was the impression you got, but you are right that we do charge for follow-up visits, which you will find is the standard and is for the time taken for the appointment. Sometimes adjustments can take months depending on the condition, and we make appropriate referrals if it’s not something we can treat within a community dermatology clinic. We understand that as a self pay patient, this can sometimes be difficult. We hope you are able to find someone to help with your condition.'}<//Resp>

<Text>I just finished a consultation with Dr. Jeff Bonnaud via ZocDoc. He is by far the kindest, professional and most informative dermatologist I've had the pleasure to meet. My treatment is 110% working and I could not have asked for a better Doctor! I highly recommend Metropolis Dermatology! The best!

Tiffany the PA is amazing! She is very sweet and gives her patients a lot of time rather than rushing. She gave me botox for the first time and I am so happy with the results! She really listened to what I wanted and made sure I was comfortable the whole time. The office itself is beautiful and everyone who works there is very nice and friendly. I love Tiffany and will definitely be. going back to see her. I highly recommend her for all your derm needs!<//review>

Was very disappointed with my experience. I went in for multiple appointments of microneedling. The Dr was always very rushed and I don’t believe did a thorough job. I also went for another procedure which cost $600 and saw no results. The doctor did not do said procedure, I watched an assistant show another assistant how to do this in front of me, which I consider very unprofessional. Overall I feel the over 1k I spent there was wasted.
I also recommend asking the preferred pronouns of your clients, it’s disrespectful to misgender clients which they did to my partner who has begun their transition and was getting facial hair removal at your clinic. I’m now going to a woman dermatologist (so is my partner) and it couldn’t be more night and day. She is thorough, genuine, not in a rush at all so I feel I can actually ask her questions and does not assume gender. It’s 2020 so please do better.

Edit: In response to having many transgender clients and being respectful, I just stated multiple situations where you didn’t ask for preferred pronouns and therefore were disrespectful.. Please don’t dismiss my partners experience and allude that it is the only one, it is incredibly unprofessional. I definitely don’t recall you or your staff asking their preferred pronouns. I also didn’t see anywhere on your intake forms asking for pronouns and your staff and yourself (Dr. Wang) repeatedly used the incorrect pronouns/never asked what they were. You’re more than welcome to reach out to myself and my partner who has already written a review. You’ve not contacted either of us to rectify this situation.< /review>

I got their new hollywood spectra laser facial and saw an immediate glow on my skin as well as improved skin texture and lightening of my acne scars. I am so happy with my results and can’t wait to get another one! I also tried the trusculpt flex and loved it. I felt like I got an amazing workout in and feel like my arms got more toned!

This was my first time here and it was such an amazing experience!!!! Everyone here is friendly and attentive. Dr. Wang really took his time with me to understand the best course of action and was really helpful. He gave me hope that my skin will be 100% clear. He was also adamant on making sure I was very comfortable and happy with everything that was explained to me. After a long search I have finally found the best dermatologist!!</Review>

Dr. Wang is an absolute exceptional dermatologist.   I have been going to him for 3 years and my skin has never looked better.   Also he is warm, understanding and honest.  HIs office and his office staff are also terrific.  He leads by example and it shows.  I wouldn't even think of going anywhere else.< /Text>

{'time': 1613843333960, 'text': "Hi Jeremy, thank you for your feedback. I believe the clinic had a lot of interactions with you through social media messages as well as in the clinic, so we were a little surprised to read the review. We do have a $170 initiation fee for all patients, which is for registration. This is clear when appointments are booked.\n\nErbium laser or any laser treatments to treat around the eye areas will be that price (or higher at most places). It is our general practice to give you a mirror during the treatment to make sure we have treated all the spots that you want treated. It's OK to have a lot of questions and we will diligently answer each one, but the best way to do this is to let us know by calling in so we can call you back for a detailed Q&A.\n\nWe are also sad that you will not be returning to our clinic, but we hope you find a suitable clinic to treat your future skin needs. Have a good day."}<//Response>

Dr. Wang gave me back my confidence and treated me without judgement. My favorite part about Dr is that he never ever tried to sell me a $300 moisturizer, and highly recommended some reasonably priced over the counter options.

The office is very flexible with in-person, phone or video appointments. The office is always professional and I always leave feeling like a movie star.

I highly recommend Metropolis Dermatology to anyone looking for a down to earth, super smart Dermatologist.</text>

Normally, I am weary of trying out new places without personal recommendations. But I am so glad that I decided to go with Dr. Wang at Metropolis. From the receptionist to my actual consultation with him, I am completely satisfied and will continue to go to this facility for my needs. I hadn’t even left the building before I sent out texts recommending him to friends, thanks again!< /Review>

< review>
I AM TRULY DISCUSSED WITH MY EXPERIENCE HERE, AND WILL NEVER REVISIT THIS SKIN CARE OFFICE AGAIN. I have been suffering from minor spots on my face and couldn’t find a product to even out my skin tone. So, I called the office and made me a consultation in hopes that they’ll know the solution to my problem. The day of my appointment I came in and spoke with Wang. I proceeded to let him know my reasoning for coming in, and what led to my minor dark spots on my face. He then immediately told me in a was very rushing way that there are three options that will work for me with the first being: retinol cream, second micro pads, and last was the micro-needling. Which was $375.00 he told me that the micro-needling was the highest but also the more effective option that will work, and that I will see results 60% of lightning on my dark spots immediately right after, Oppose to the other two option he mentioned it’ll take much longer for me to see any change really. So of course, being that my spots been on my skin for a very long time I was convinced based off of what I was presented, micro-needling was the best for me. So, he started my micro-needing and as soon as he finished my spots looked HORRIFIC and even darker. So I told him I don’t see the “60% results” you mentioned. Than he contradicted himself and said well give your spots three weeks to heal and you should see your spots lighten up (by the way I wasn’t even given or acknowledged about anything to use on my face to help with the healing process.)  So three week past by and my spots got even more darker from the micro-needling. And I’m highly disappointed with the lies I was told from Wang. He does not have your best interest at heart, or care for your appearance to improve. Instead he rather lure you into paying the highest amount of funds, and have no interest into solving your issues. he’s by far the worst care doctor ever.</review>

Even though we have much success treating dark spots here, it is unusual for us to promise a percentage improvement after only one treatment of microneedling, which usually requires a few sessions over a period of a few months. With microneedling, the immediate recovery is one week, but the final results takes weeks up to a month or more. In any case, we wish you well and hope that you are able to resolve the dark spot issue you mentioned.'}</Response>

<review>Lovely and communicative experience with the doctor. He asked me what I wanted and was very helpful in explaining to me the solutions we could try to help address my skin concerns.

I’m taking off a point because of their booking system. I booked through Zoc Doc and got multiple email and text confirmation messages that my appointment was at 10:15. The day before, I got a text message from the office itself saying my appt was confirmed for 9:45. I replied back multiple times saying my appt was 10:15 but got no response. I showed up at 10:15 for my appointment anyway and the receptionist rudely told me that my appointment was at 10. Notice how an appointment at 10am was NEITHER 9:45 as they had confirmed, nor 10:15 as I had originally booked. My first impression of them was that they were extremely unprofessional, but this was redeemed when the doctor came in to talk to me.

They need to get it together, the doctors that work at this clinic deserve more competent scheduling/scheduling staff.</review>< pictures>

<text>I had a very seamless and amazing appointment with Angelica Ibarra for my pyogenic granuloma.

I had no issues scheduling an appointment on their website. Once I got there, I was checked in and shown into a room right away! Angelica was super friendly and easy to talk to (really enjoyed our conversation, even during the procedure)!

Before she did the procedure, she made sure I understood the pros and cons of the procedure. She is also very knowledgeable - can't recommend her enough!!

She was able to remove the pyogenic granuloma on the same day and the whole process took less than 10 mins! She talked to me the whole time and made sure I was okay. The procedure was painless and I felt really comfortable.

There is a parking garage right outside the building and I believe it was $7? I ended up finding street parking and paid for an hour ($3/hr).</text>< pictures>

Not very detail oriented, high prices and not the results I was expecting. Went somewhere else and have been having great results and better prices. Staff are hit and miss, and sometimes unskilled people doing expensive procederes.

Update: after a year of going other places I double down on my previous comments...this place is over priced, not trans-people sensitive, and expensive procedures and poor consultations.  I spent over 1500 dollars here and he never once said laser doesn’t work on orange or red hair, but the next place I went to said that immediately and recommended Electeolysis.   Also many of the reviews are  suspect for this business, no previous reviews etc. this place should be a 3.5 at best.<//review>

I just got microneedling done here yesterday as part of a series of treatments that were recommended for me. I’ll update as my treatment goes on to talk about results, but the actual treatment itself was a breeze. I went to a lot of other consultations through the years searching for a solution to my old depressed acne scars and poor skin texture and never felt completely comfortable with either the doc or the rather aggressive treatment plans suggested. Based on all the other reviews here and how comfortable my initial consultation and first appointment went, I feel I’m definitely trusting my skin with the right derm. Also, since we are still in the midst of a serious pandemic, I feel it’s worth pointing out that the office is super clean and everyone is wearing a mask. Very comforting!<//Review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

<text>Had a large cyst (golfball size) on back of my head that really needed to be removed! I just came across this clinic by googling. I emailed with photos of my problem and called and the staff was responsive (have called a couple other clinics and got no response). I have NO insurance so I asked if they could tell me the cost ahed of time which they did. The visit took an hour, and I was afraid a procedure like this could cost thousands? It cost me a lot (considering I am a day worker) but I think it was probably a reasonable price. Dr. Yang answered all my questions and I am so happy the cyst is finally gone. The office is modern and seems focused on beauty treatments (this is LA), but he is well-qualified to handle real dermatological issues. Hopefully I won't have other problems, but if I do, I will go back to Metropolis Dermatology.< /text>< pics>

<Review>After 8 years of searching on and off for a Doctor that I feel actually takes the time to genuinely listen, I've finally found him here at Metropolis Dermatology.

Rude receptionist who was clueless and couldn't provide basic information on treatments offered.  Despite multiple attempts to get in touch with someone who could answer my questions, all I got was the receptionist's attitude.  If this is how Metropolis treats people trying to give them money, I'd hate to think what it's like if and when something goes wrong.

I'll take my business elsewhere.<//Review>

I've been seeing Dr. Wang for many years, but so glad I got to see him in his own brand new office in DTLA, which is especially nice, with views of the city, hardwood floors, and amazing murals. You feel like you're in an art gallery, but in a non-pretentious way. The vibe is young and trendy, and they have the latest in cosmetic lasers. Their skincare line is fantastic - you have to try the Glow antioxidant cream - definitely making my skin better than the high-end stuff you buy at department stores.<//Review>

This place is next to my workplace and so I gave it a try and stopped in for a small rash and ended up getting a couple of small spots zapped by Dr. Wang. He is one of the nicest dermatologists I've met and answered all of my list of questions. He is hilarious and his office and the view from there is immaculate. Their moisturizer and day cream also made my skin feel like silk. Would highly recommend giving this place a try.< /review>

I went with my friend to saw Dr. Wang for a small blemish on his nose. The blemish was thoroughly addressed, diagnosed, and treated. Dr. Wang is patient and kind, and explained everything in detail - better more than the dermatologists I saw in the past. I like the modern and calm style of the clinic. The check-in process is especially easy with high-tech and all electronic. The clinic has a nice view of the downtown. I have not seen such stunning views in other derm or doctor's office at all. Highly recommend!<//text>

Metropolis Dermatology offers a calm and tranquil environment, very welcoming for first time and returning patients.  Dr. Wang is an incredibly talented doctor, with a wonderful staff of kind and efficient individuals.

I am looking forward to future treatments with Metropolis Dermatology!

Dr. Wang and the team at Metropolis dermatology are the best! I trust Dr. Wang wholeheartedly. He went to Harvard Medical School and is the smartest board certified dermatologist I know. From autoimmune skin conditions, to stubborn acne, or body tightening and lasers, he has you covered. I have known him for over 3 years and trust him with my skincare needs. His new office is the “FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH!” He has ALL of the new lasers and body tightening machines and offers fillers and anti-wrinkle injections that will make you look 10yrs younger than when you walked in. Location is prime!! Located in the hip and hot area of downtown LA, with panoramic views of the city and gorgeous wall art, you can escape from the hustle and bustle into a chic and modern space! Parking is easy and plentiful The office manager, Marissa is so helpful and the nurse Samantha is very knowledgeable and kind. Dr. Wang is a family man and great with babies and kids too!</review>

I use to see Dr Wang at another office and naturally I HAD TO follow him when he opened his own practice! He's as smart as he is understanding and compassionate; and apparently he's also got an eye for design because his new office is sleek.
In all seriousness, it's always a great experience to visit Dr Wang's office and I highly recommend it!</text>

It's soo beautiful, the staff are amazing they greet you and right away they offer you coffee, soft drinks, water or snacks  I was a bit hungry after that LA drive so it was perfect. I came in for a skin checkup/mole check.. I was roomed with in minutes, was asked many questions and skin cancer history by the medical assistant.. Dr. Wang came in checked my skin and thought one of my moles was suspicious so he removed it and sent it to the lab for testing. I had many questions since it was my first mole removed and he was very nice and understanding and actually answered my questions with detail unlike others that are just trying to leave the room. I even asked him about this dark spot I have on my right upper arm and he recommended one of there product is was the HQ pads. I been using them for about one week and the spot already looks lighter, very happy and glad I found Dr. Wang.. btw parking can get a little tough but if you park across the street at the smart and final you can get one hour free.< /text><response>None</response>< Rating>

<review>I’m in my mid 30s and needed to see a dermatologist after recently developing rosacea. I heard about Dr. Wang through a friend. At first, I was worried I’d only be seeing an assistant in his office (I mean, what doctor with a pedigree from Harvard and UCLA ACTUALLY has time to see a patient!!), but that’s not what happened at all. Dr. Wang spent time with me and really took the time to get to know me and go through my concerns. He was humble, gracious, and patient. Very happy with my experience – I’ll definitely be going to Dr. Wang for all my dermatology needs!<//review></record>

Great location in DTLA for the best dermatologist in the area.  Couldn't be happier with my choice.  The office is convenient and looks amazing, the doctor is knowledgeable, and the staff is great!</Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I had a wound on my forearm - a curling iron burn - ugh, something I had not done to myself since my teens!!  It wasn't healing and I went to Dr Wang to make sure nothing was seriously wrong.  He not only treated the wound and speeded up the healing but then lasered it, which helped to prevent a huge scar.  I went back for one more laser treatment and magically the scar is gone.  I am so excited about the new office - I really appreciated how he was able to see me immediately, really cared about my concerns and resolved the problem quickly and easily - now other people will get to experience that as well.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This was my 2nd time visiting this dermatology place and I came here for my TMJ botox.  I was seen very promptly after arriving and only waited a few short minutes.  Tiffany, their PA, was the one who did it and she did a great job.  She was very efficient and answered any questions I had.  The whole process was painless and overall, I'm very pleased with my experience.

The office was also very clean and all the staff seemed very friendly.  Definitely taking COVID precautions very seriously which is awesome!

If you're looking for a great dermatology office then be sure to check out this place.</Review>< pictures>

<text>Terrible customer service. I bought brand new battery from garden Grove store. My car had loose wire. Never used the battery. Anaheim store wouldn't let me refund battery because they said the battery terminal was scuffed. I bought it like that. It was my job to prove i didn't use the battery. I had to prove the scuff was there when i bought it. How the heck do i prove i didn't use the battery? Been going O'Reilly for long time. Taking my business to Autozone from now on.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Hard working employees. Smart management. Customer service oriented.

The O'Reilly east of this location made every excuse to not help me. This one made every effort to help .. and succeeded! Not only did they fix the mistake of different location, but Josh personally helped me with the installation and educated me so I could be self reliant in the future.

If you need auto parts, even if its out of your way, this is the location for you!<//text>

< Review>
I wanted to like them but unfortunately their work is sloppy. They don’t wear shoe covers so they walk around your floors with their dirty shoes... which sort of defeats the point of cleaning. This was my swiffer after they left. They offered to come back and take care of the missed spots but essentially you need to tell them exactly what to do. I need a cleaning service where I don’t need to babysit.

They also stacked things on my non-stick pan so there are scratches now and it’s unusable. Beware.< /Review>

<text>They’re really great about communicating price, time and how to add tip to the cost. The team does a great job following directions and also just doing such a good job cleaning. It’s such a relief coming home and the house is cleaner than I ever could get it.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
Thanks InstaMaids! I haven't seen my apartment so clean in a very long time! I needed deep cleaning and I was looking for someone who are professionals. Yes, I found them! I was very pleased with the work they did. My apartment looks like new again! This company wants to make you happy and the service works really hard to do so. Hire them if you need an emergency clean!< /Review>

<Review>Wonderful service, sparkling clean everything including old tea cattle and other small items, all shelfs, behind furniture - above and beyond anything I could imagine.

I've been using InstaMaids for almost 3 years and I highly recommend. They are reliable, the service is great and the price is right. The highlight is that I can schedule everything online through their website, select services I need, change dates etc - which is super convenient since I have a busy schedule, lots of meetings and I don't want to have to call and get a hold of someone to find a new time slot or change something in the upcoming service would.<//text>

They call this a standard clean.  I can't imagine what more they could have done for a deep clean because our apartment is just beautiful, from the shine on our tables to the oven that looks new.

They got here 15 minutes early and were fast and thorough.  Great job at a good price.  Thank you.< /review>< Pics>

The cleaning is spotless and they are also very accommodating in scheduling the service. The only issue I had was the team that came for cleaning never arrived on time, so our weekend schedule was messed up waiting for them. Once I talked to the customer service, they sorted the issue and since then the team is always on time. I have already recommended Insta maids to my friends and family in the bay area.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

We got off to a Rocky start with this service- but we now have an amazing team come to our house lead by Amy. They are magicians and Amy is a fantastic communicator and really gives everything from start to finish that personal touch- even down to some cleaning tips!! 10/10 recommend<//Review>

<Text>I had to update this review, they suck, after several cleanings, they just start to get worse and worse, they take your feedback, feel sorry for it, but repeat the same things over and over. They don't bother to move a book or a picture frame or anything to take the dust out.

Do yourself a favor and save money. get some recommendation from another person at your complex or neighborhood.

And last cleaning (this morning), they broke my microwave handle and left whatever that is in my stove. And best part? ZERO communication, they just left it there as it never happened...

DEFINITELY NEVER BOOKING WITH THEM AGAIN.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPokmkWmyQOnB8ngjEAasnGRShwwd98hatwlkws=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpfl2-vAwrqMj9L_BL40HEswdQF2Zp-QOBVNIw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

Our home needed a deep cleaning and hasn't had one for years so I finally booked InstaMaids.  They were great! They got out stains in the bathroom that I assumed were permanent.  They were also very courteous of the fact that I had two very shy cats and were professional, prompt, and did a great job making my home inhabitable again!

Highly recommend and will use them in the future for cleaning needs.</text>

Overall happy with the cleaning, but it wasn't perfect which I'd expect when paying close to $200. I paid for deep cleaning. First I would appreciate a little class when I meet them. They tried to open apartment door right after knocking. After I opened the door, a group of 4-5 people stormed in with just saying: "Hi, instamaids". I had to find a 1 person who spoke english and pulled them out to explain what I wanted them to clean. I appreciated they did the job within promised time, but missed some some spots. Faucets in bathtub and sinks were not cleaned. I noticed the bathtub one during check and they cleaned it on request. The kitchen counter tops weren't completely smooth after the clean - they were cleaned but could have used more scrub. For deep clean I'd expect better. I paid less for cleaning in Seattle and got much more attention to detail.< /text>

My filthy apartment was beyond hope. I'm pleasantly surprised at how much they cleaned--they got done in 3 hours what I couldn't have done myself in an entire week.

I did not feel judged either, and overall the process was comfortable. Very professional. Thanks!< /text>

I have been using InstaMaids for a year now. Their service might seem bit expensive but they do the job very well. One thing I like about them is you don't have to tell them details.. their team takes care of things! Tip for saving on cost use recurring service.. totally worth it 🙂< /Text>

We have had a scheduled cleaning of our home every four weeks for a while now. The upside is when the maids are here, they do a good job.

But scheduling and consistency of showing up on time has been a nightmare. Worst customer experience of any business I've ever dealt with- and I say that with full seriousness, not being hyperbolic. I'm not someone who gives a negative review lightly.

They show up on time well below 50% of the time. They ask to reschedule less than an hour before the booking all the time. Multiple times we have caught them in an outright lie regarding their excuse about why they are late or can't make it. Multiple times I have done phone tag with their customer service and ran around my complex looking for maids who they say are there, only to find out a half hour later that they were never there in the first place.

I'm willing to be pretty accommodating with scheduling. But don't lie to me and intentionally waste my time. I feel bad for the actual cleaners since I somewhat suspect these issues are out of their hands, but I just can't keep giving this company my business.< /Review>

They are NOT "instant". The first time I used Instamaids everything was great as far as the service three women came and took care of everything in a little over an hour. The second time they forgot to clean my tub and I needed them to come out a second time to clean it. Didn't bother me mistakes happen and I let is slide but received no incentive for the mistake. This third time was a disaster. They were scheduled between 8am and 9am (today) but when we called they said they would call us back in 10 minutes. We did not hear back until 45 minutes later. The employees that were scheduled to clean my home were " in an accident" but this was failed to be reported to us and had we not called we would have never received this information.

I am just glad we did not have an important event in our home and relied on them to arrive. Their communication is not good. They make their own schedule and will leave you guessing on their arrival.

The worst of it is I am an Assistant Property Manager where I live and refer my residents to them and moving forward I will not be giving their information out. Lets just say, you may be happy the first time but they will fail you at some point. I suggest that instead of finding a company that is good IF they arrive you find another cleaning company that arrives when they say they will as well as do a good job.</text>

< review>
I have been using Instamaids for a little over a year now. I'm constantly traveling and just don't have time to tidy up. A friend recommended Instamais  and I can honestly say it's been more than just a cleaning service. The satisfying feeling you get when walking into your CLEAN home after a week of travel. PRICELESS!<//review>

<Review>I booked full service including pretty much everything, but turned out to be a big disappointment!  Areas left not cleaned.  I booked the cleaning for 2 glass doors.  Only one was cleaned.  $25 for cleaning the patio and nothing was done there.  Inside cabinets, still dusty after cleaning.  definitely not recommend.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I hosted party at my home and booked an appointment with instamaids online.  It was so easy to book an appointment and customize the cleaning to my needs. They are extremely professional and thorough.  I signed up for their monthly service...I cant wait for their next visit! If you are looking for an outstanding maid service at a great price thats super convenient...you have to give them a try!< /Text>

<text>Great caring people. Food is basically good and clean. It lacks finesse and isn't the same as it was 20 yrs ago, but it is still good. The last time I was here, one of the employees looked after her regular customers with wonderfully beautiful care and kindness. She blessed my day displaying a level of care for an elderly man in a wheelchair that I haven't seen for quite some time. God sends angels to bless the needy and demonstrate love for all of us to follow.< /text><rate>5< /rate>< Name>

<review>Had a great experience, they operate like a family. The woman behind the counter, the older woman who was a cashier seemed like she'd been working there forever. Very polite and conversation was familiar, pleasant. The fried foods are okay. Fried mushrooms weren't what we expected. Overall clean storefront and timely service. Food was what you would expect from a family owned long time been in business diner.</review>< user_id>

<Review>It was OK for the price. I liked the dinner atmosphere but the appearance needs to be freshened up. With all little face-lift, a jukebox and fresh ingredients this place could be great....it does have a great look from the outside.</Review>< Pics>

Just got home called order in, perfect timing. Got home food is hot and delicious. We ordered the sausage breakfast burrito the ham breakfast burrito and a stack of pancakes everything is really good. We especially love the freshness of the flour tortilla and the buttery taste to it also the hashed browns inside are perfectly cooked the salsa is fresh and tasty the eggs arent overcooked and dry. The pancakes are nice and fluffy and delicious. The only reason I didnt give it all 5 stars was the portion. My cousin is 6`4" and one breakfast burrito fit in the palm of his hand. So other than that it was great.< /review>

Always delicious. Generous portions. Friendly staff. My only complaint is when the fries aren't cooked enough and are limp. I love hot  crispy fries.  It's a hit most of the time.</Review>

The lady taking orders can’t understand english and i told her my order 5 times, when i get to the window she repeated my order which was wrong and i told her what needed to be fixed. She still messed up my order and forgot to give me my corndogs after she read them off to me. This isn’t the first or second time it happened.  I won’t be going back until they get someone that speaks and understands fluent English.< /Review>

It’s a family run restaurant. I go here for breakfast almost every weekend and I enjoy the familiarity of the spot. The ladies are always nice and the owner is friendly. Even though it can get busy, you can usually get a seat somewhere.

The food is what it is. I love the breakfast and omelettes here and I even like the salads. The burgers are good, but I think it’s pretty standard.

The price for food is fair.

The only bad thing is the restroom. I only go to the men’s, well... because I’m a man. It’s not a pretty sight.

I live close by so... if necessary I just go home.<//review>

Service was great and the place was very clean. The prices were very reasonable. The quality of the food tasted fresh but the avocados did have oxidation, so they probably have been sitting for a bit. The taste was decent, but not much to brag about. Fries were nice and crisp with a fluffy interior. The two negatives I have are that the flavor is a bit bland and it was annoying to have Fox News playing on their TV. Not really fun to be trying to have lunch with over-the-top hosts screaming from a TV.< /Text>

Not completely satisfied with our order tonight. Incorrectly made but of course we didn't find that out until  we got home. Could be due to the dinner rush along with the covid situation.<//Review>

Food is great.. But not so clean.. The owner should take some pride in keeping clean... Under the tables, it is disgusting and not hygienic for people to sit and enjoy eating, not worrying about dirtying their clothes and stuff if it falls. Sorry 2 less stars for environment.<//review>

So I love this place. I've been coming here for at least 10 years. The burgers are great the fries are delicious. I love the fried zucchini! But my favorite thing on the menu is the beans. They have really really delicious refried beans. I live kinda far these days but when I'm in town this is my go to!< /Text>

Great little place that's been there for a long, long, long time. They serve Mexican American fare including a nice breakfast menu. The hash browns are always perfectly golden brown and they are always busy. In the fast food burger category, they are at the top of my list.< /review>

Great, and I mean GREAT breakfast burritos. Pro Tip - get the salsa on the side, better experience of the fresh salsa that way.

Oh, and if you ask for anything extra or on the side for that matter, check your order before leaving if you go through the drive thru. Sometimes, people just forget to add them. Otherwise, no issues, been coming here since 2002!< /text>

Breakfast is good there, burgers are okay. I ordered fries one time, and somebody cleaned the fryer out on me, all my fries were burnt and old. Never ordered lunch or dinner again.< /Text>

The food is awesome!!!! Always fresh and fast, no matter what. I usually get the pastrami combo which is pretty f******* good! Every time I'm somewhat close, I make sure to stop, even if I just ate! Their shakes are really good as well, they could add some flavors and, oh yeah! Stop charging for a side of ranch! Really?? Just spent 10$ on a combo, then I gotta pay for condiment??? No,no,,no!!!
Otherwise this place is great! Keep it up!</review>

<Review>Okay so this is the first time and last time I come here. First of all the woman who takes the orders is so rude. Not to mention I ordered a Philly cheesesteak and I got a pastrami sandwich. When I confronted her and explained this is pastrami not steak she said no that’s steak. I’m not a rocket scientist but clearly you can establish the difference between beef and pork. I’m so frustrated purchased a 10 dollar sandwich and it’s so gross. Instead of offering something different to help accommodate your customer, she tells me I don’t know what to tell you. Whoever is the owner I can assure you, you’re better off firing the useless person bringing down your sales. She’s the most incompetent person I’ve ever met, and your food is gross. Except your fries you get a star for those. I spend over 50 dollars here to get mistreated? What kind of establishment is this?
Although I will say the only considerate person is Pete. I told him about my food and boom he turned around immediately and offered me something else. Thank goodness for Pete!!!!</Review>< Pictures>

Used to come here alot but probably not so much anymore. You get alot for what you pay for but i want it to have some flavor. I ordered a chicken fried steak sandwich with almost not seasoning and same with the fried zucchini, no seasoning, clumped together like it was all just dumped in the fryer. I got fish tacos and they were flavorless mush, no crispiness. The salsa tasted like chopped tomato and onion. Bland, boring, blah.</Text>

Everything we ordered tasted either old, or soggy, even the biscuits & gravy were gross (bread like a puck and gravy was like flour water) Not even the pastrami was good.  To add insult to injury it was overpriced, I will just go on over to Mr. Pete's in Downey next time.<//review><response>None</response><Pics>None</Pics></record>

The food is great. I always get the daily burger special. The only thing is that everytime I go, there always seems to be a problem with my order. I always ask for no onions but I still always get onions. It's not that big of a deal, but it's something to watch out for.</review>

Excellent breakfast this morning.  Ordered the special: 2 eggs, hash browns, 4 strips of bacon, and delicious pico de gallo.  $6 and change, so a good purchase.</review>
