I was pleasantly surprised at the price, and realized that I had paid too much elsewhere in the past! Alex ordered the tires, and they arrived the next morning, so he promptly called to let me know that they were in. I wasn’t able to go until a few days later, but went first thing in the morning when they opened at 9a.m. on Saturday, and they got my car back to me in less than two hours, which included removing my old tires, mounting the new ones, and performing an alignment. They even shined the tires, which was a nice touch, especially since I had just washed my car the day before! I don’t think I’ve ever had a place do that before. Sometimes, it’s the little things. I will absolutely be returning the next time I need tires.</Text>< time>

Discount Tires is the ONLY place I go to for my car repairs and tires for the last 6 years. The employees are very friendly and helpful. The manager takes great care of his customers and the prices are always low and fair. They are quick but thorough. Thank you Discount Tires for taking care of all my car needs!
I highly recommend Discount Tires.<//Text>

Very friendly staff, Aron was very helpful. I had gotten an estimate from  another shop before I went and after comparing , both shops agreed the same thing needed to be fixed, so I know they are honest and this shop was a tad bit better priced. Cars running great now, thanks.<//Text>

I've been here a total of 3 times. The first time, I called all the local shops to find the best deal for my budget. I decided to go with Discount Tires because, well... They had the tire I needed at the moment. I HATE "adulting" and making calls, dealing with corporations, feeling pressured to make decisions on things I know nothing about. I walked in completely guarded. Everything changed because they actually want to help. I came back 2x this year because of how easy it is to get in and get out. No pressure. Nothing. Yes, suggestions will be made. At the end of the day, you make the choice. They try to make you feel welcomed and known. You are addressed by name. You are remembered. Try this place out if you need tire and/or car service. Everytime I have been there, every customer (including myself) has been happy.<//review>

<rate>1</rate><review>These guys are so crooked. They sold me two $90 tires. I got the four for the price of two deal. The total bill was almost $500 for four of the buy two get two free $90 tires. Then they lied to me to sell unneeded parts.  The service advisor told me that the rear suspension was out of alignment. In order to align the car I would need a rear suspension arm because the arm on my car was not adjustable and it would cost $300. I took the car to an honest shop and they told me that  the rear arm was adjustable and the honest shop did the job for $99. Beware of the Discount Tire center.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

I would HIGHLY reccommend this place for just about all your car needs. Ladies they are very trustworthy (men as well) but I referenced the ladies because a lot of the time we may not know the repair shop jargan as well as men.

I came back to discount tire,  and told d manager what costco said to me, he was pssst and was hesitant to do my allignment, stated, I don't even know when you bought d God knows when lifetime wheel allignment ". They did it anyway but they have to make me wait. This store's goal is to make you buy tires from them. CAPITALISM at its finest.

The 2 stars is simply because of the service. We were standing 6 feet away in line,  another couple comes and stands right at the bar and the server goes and attends to them first even though we had already been waiting. Service just isn't what it used to be now a days.< /Text>

<review>Great place. Stumbled on it behind the camp and figured it was a good time for a beer. Ended up getting the Guava Kolsch, but they have Hazys, Porters, IPAs, blondes, and one nitro. I'd recommend.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Poor guys behind the bar are giving out change. Why don’t the prices include tax like every other tasting room? $6 for a 12oz beer (plus tax), not the best deal in town. Decent brews.</Review>< Response>

<Review>The Salty Bear brewing company is a brand new brewery to me! I didn't even know they were around until my friend posted a pint of beer with a logo I didn't recognize.  They're located on the same street as Gunwhale ales and Barley Forge.  Leaning more along the lines of ales.

The atmosphere is chill with an island vibe music (Friday about 7pm).  Place was packed with patrons inside and outside on the patio outside.

Beers are mainly ales, but also vary from Gose's to I've seen one porter so far.  I tend to lean towards the stronger ABV and Belgian Styles and Salty Bear has a great Belgian strong ale.

Unfortunately there is no food cooked here, but fortunately food can be brought in or ordered since they are right behind the CAMP, Costa Mesa.

Check this place out!<//Review>< pics>

They closed earlier at 6:30 supposed to be 7 because of covid and had the audacity to let me wait outside while there was only 3 people that just went inside and say they’re closed as they left. Didn’t even have the curtesy of opening the door and letting me know that no one else would be allowed in. They saw me waiting in front of the door for 10 minutes. IDIOTS, especially the one with red high lights. Stuck up little girls.</text>

Both managers and staff members were eager to help with stock and price check.  They would never reply with "Whatever we have on the floor...." b.s. I feel so welcome and 'like home' whenever I visit the store (at least once a month; holiday months I went 2x a month). Store Manager (Nicole) and Assistance Store Manager (Kayla) have the 'hands on' approach.  They take part in serving the customers (or visitors) and are always with genuine SMILES (not a crack of lips). They are always on the floor, but not hiding in the back office. This True Religion store  will play a role in my decision for residence relocation.<//review>< pictures>

Subway is a place i go to for fresh food. The selection is amazing, such as the condiments and meats..you can get oven baked sandwiches or just a fresh bread. I always get the cheddar cheese and jalapeno bread. It's always fresh and good. It's a must try if you haven't already..</review>

<Text>Always clean. Always top quality sandwiches at this location. Small store, so usually there is a small que to wait, but the employees are always cordial. I 💜 the chicken ranch when it's offered in the cycle of specials.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Good value for the price, and the only thing I don't like about Subway is their bread. If you plan on saving the sandwich for later toss it as gets soggy in no time. If I have leftovers I will put them in a container to keep. Then place on fresh bread when ready to eat.< /text>< Date>

Great food, great employees, and very clean inside. I'd give it a five only it weren't a Subway. That said it's one of the best I've ever been to.<//Text>

You could see that they had the cooling temperature on their meat and veggies too cold. You can see the ice forming on the medal containers. Their is one woman that is rude and has attitude. Will not go back until they get ride of her and get the temperatures right on their food< /Review>

Customer service is not good at this location.  Rude and when they made my breakfast sandwich without the egg all they said was "it doesn't come with It".<//review>

< review>
I dont even want to rate it 1 star . How about a quarter of 1 star , worst service ! Lady working at 10 pm on april 30 2017 gave the worst service . The new guy working was polite . Should reconsider who you guys hire . Only reason i came here is because its 24/7 , but makes me want to drive further to another subway 24/7 honestly .< /review>

<Review>The clubhouse at Ironwood Country Club is stunning. I had breakfast there as part of a chamber of commerce event and the food was delicious. The service was fantastic is spacious and well-appointed. There are million-dollar views everywhere you turn. It's hard to describe the tranquility that you feel when you step outside. Just the sound of birds chirping and little else.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCm1fvCwvPmIu-NpoBi-PUtWnwowr3DQONEdVH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMH6UvEi4n7e3StRwUoUgfK7FEoqnx7Sv0sCy4W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLIPSLCJqtpnrEQy2Cj5Wh5YToYrqBWpnM1RiV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

I have lived at Ironwood for 25 years and it is truly *the club above the rest.* I wake up every day grateful to live in this beautiful club. It is so beautifully located and everything is perfectly groomed. A 5 star for sure.<//review>

Lovely club with terrific view from clubhouse. Food and service are very good. Golf course, especially South one, has a great reputation.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Excellent course, played the North course, a bit short but challenging and in excellent shape.  Greens rolled well, though a bit hard to hold even with a wedge. Staff and food were also very enjoyable.</text>< userid>

<Text>The staff is fantastic ! Mike and Chris are there to ensure golfers are maximizing their experience.  Course is meticulously maintained. Spikes is a great place to grab food on the go.

I am from Alaska and my friends and I rented a place here in Iroonwood 2 community. At first everything was great besides that no one would help get anything fixed since our place has yet to be remodeled. We have been here for over a year now and we have got the absolute WORST service I've ever experienced. One lady here, who is said to be on the board, has constantly harassed my roommates and me. Why she is mad? We don't know. She has reported us for many violations in which she has made up. We are constantly invaded of our privacy when she is peering in our windows and pointing at us as she bickers to renters. When we approach her respectively to get more informed and maybe come to compromise the situation, She say "I will not engage with you" and "Have you got the eviction notice yet?". She does not like that our screen door in the back has been broken but this is out of our control. We are told to not fix anything ourselves and have tried to get someone to fix it due to this fact but no one seems to care. We can't have too many chairs out back on OUR renting property and we can't even hang a hammock on OUR patio because of the way it looks. We are now getting kicked out for these situations which are either out of our control or our personal situational living ideas. If anyone would want to live hear DO NOT expect to live how you want to. Expect a lady invade your privacy and harass you until she gets you out of here. She has seemed to forget that we are in america and that there are certain rights us americans get. Our neighbors are awesome and the security understands us but this lady (who I have been polite enough to not mention her name) is a nuisance to the community even telling a home owner who was on their home phone to be quiet when she was bickering about us. If you want to constantly have a lady on your ass this is the place for you.< /Review>

DO NOT SIGN UP YOU KIDS TO DO ANY SPORTS HERE! They hire unqualified referees, the staff doesn't know 3 points from 2 points
Then when you voice your opinion they are rude. IF YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO EXCEL AND GROW IN SPORTS DO NOT SIGN THEM UP. Dont waste your money, dont waste your time.< /text>

<review>The Gonzales Center has offered many different programs and services throughout the years including: classes like karate, gymnastics, swimming, and folklorico; also programs such as Day Camp, Teen Center, Senior Center, and various sports. I understand that many people who walk into the center become quite unhappy when they find out that they cannot use the restroom for lack of being a "Program Participant", however, this is their policy and it has been put into place to protect all Staff Members and Program Participants (especially for the many minors there). So, please keep this in mind when visiting, and I'm sure you'll have a pleasant experience at the GCC :)<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcad20f1a293eb:0x493ceb83b60ee405</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Nice facility for a recreational swim. Splash pad is pretty small and children get over it fast does not have a kiddie pool which would be great and for the big pool they do not provide life jackets if kids do not have one. They also charge infants less than y months and adults even if ur not getting wet which is a downer.< /text>

<review>I have called the center 6 times on a Monday afternoon at 4:20 pm and I cannot get through.  This is ridiculous!  There are numbers on the automated answer message asking to leave a message on a different call.  This is a public facility where there are enough employees to get the phone. What is the problem?< /review><Date>1376954773866<//Date><rate>2< /rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcad20f1a293eb:0x493ceb83b60ee405< /Gmap_id><user_name>Manny Fresco< /user_name>< userid>

(Translated by Google) The place has a pool, gym and classes for children of self-defense, but you have to be careful because there are always homeless people there in the park and around the table area.

El lugar tiene alberca, gym y clases para niños de defensa personal, pero tienes que ir con cuidado porque siempre hay vagabundos allí atrás en el parque y por el área de las mesas.< /Review>

<Review>I took my new puppy toy Schnauzer to Adobe and I could not be happier. Such a great first impression. The vet was wonderful and spent a long time with me explaining everything will be need for my little girl. I have 2 other miniature schnauzers and I will definitely be changing them to Adobe. The staff is also great and very friendly. Thank you!!!< /Review>< rate>

Dr. Reens, Dr. Killian and the staff at Adobe Animal Hospital are phenomenal. My family has been taking our pets to them for years and we have always received caring and professional care that goes above and beyond what other veterinary clinics are willing to do. They have seen my dog for several last-minute and emergency appointments and have consulted with me over the phone when I have been unsure of what to do for my pet. It's clear that they truly care for the animals they serve. I wouldn't trust my pets at any other clinic. I've never had a veterinarian my dog is actually excited to see!! Thank you Adobe staff!< /review>

It's only been a second day after I had my two 9 months old cats neutered,  but they are doing great, wounds look more like paper cuts, dry and it seems like my boys are in no pain which I was worried the most!! Not to mention that AAH is one of the rare ones doing surgeries during shelter in place and for a reasonable price! My boys will need some additional vaccination in the future and I'm pretty sure Adobe animal hospital will be my first option. Good job girls 😻<//Text>

I had to take my siezuring kitten in there after accidently putting canine flea treatment containing permethrin and my petite 13 week old kitten was on the brink of death. I didnt know anything about adobe only that they were the closest to my house. They are not an emergency hospital but tgey looked at my poor baby shaking so violently and uncontrollably and iimediately took her into the back room to administer one of several doses of anti siezure medicines. I honestly wasnt expecting her to survive and i thpught for sure she would have permanent brain damage, however i am so happy to report that she is cpmpletely 100% bsbk to normal.and i was able to take her home the sane. Day. They saved her life and worked with me on the billing. I truly love this place.. The entire staff is awsome amd ill be bringing my cat here for everything! (Especially flea treatment).  Thank you adobe.< /review>

<Review>I have been an Adobe Animal Hospital client for more than 10 years. Dr. Killian and her staff are amazing!!! I feel like we are all one big family. The care and devotion they have for my pets is beyond my expectations. My husband and I recently lost our beloved Zoey who became victim to heart failure. She passed on Thanksgiving morning and on Friday morning we took her to Adobe for guidance and assistance with her cremation. The front office staff and the technician were so gentle with our feelings, helped create little paw prints, and guided me on the process for the cremation. I would never dream of going to another vet.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>Nice, down-to-earth, people, who provide quality care. The doctors are honest, non-nonsense, and qualified; the staff are friendly and helpful. We took our last dog here, for many years, and now they take care of our new bundle of furry joy!<//text>< Gmap_id>

pretty sure they will never forget me and my dogs.
my husband and i came in there at 5 something in the afteroon, and they knew at that moment that we needed help so bad.  one of their staff suddenly stood up, and called one of her coworker right away , they were so fast. they took our dogs and they did their best for them to survived.sadly, one of them did not make it but I know all of them specially Dr. reenes did their best in their power for my dogs to survived. i want to thank all of their staffs and Dr reenes for everything.< /Text>

<time>1539629674298< /time><review>After my dog gave birth to 10 beautiful puppies I brought her to this bet cause she was getting very weak and her stomach was getting larger then normal.the first thing that caught my attention to pay close attention to how they operate was listening to my dog cry and gasp for air, when I went to the back room she looked as if she was dead, eyes rolled back, and younger hanging out the side of her mouth with her mouth closed , I should of left right away but allowed them to perform a mammogram,  blood test and x rays costing about $500, in my opinion they didn't spend nearly enough time looking at x rays , and only spent about a minute and a half with the mammogram machine, when they went to take blood they took from center of her neck which only took them about 15 trys before they found her vain, when
the results from blood test showed that she was not producing red blood cells they told me she meeded a blood transfusion costing $2000 which i denied, they ended up giving me iron supplement to help her naturally produce red blood cells and told me they would be surprised if she was still alive 2 days after visit which was about 2 weeks ago, they also failed to warn me about the iron supplement giving her constipation, she ended up getting even bigger cause of inability to poop, when she finally went poop after following her around for 2 days telling her she had to go potty i found worms in it, I called them for dewormer and they told me it would be $23 but they were supper busy, to busy to simply grab and sell a bottle of former to me so I asked if I could get dewormer from any other vet or pet store , there response was no vet would sell to me unless she had a visit, basically trying to trap me into believing I could only get product from them, kinda funny cause you could buy dewormer over the counter at almost any pet supplies store. I will never take my dog her again also my sister is going to look for another vet for her animals.i would never recommend this vet to anybody.as for rose she is progressing every day and we expect her to make a full recovery<//review><rating>1< /rating>< gmap_id>

<Text>If you don't care about your pet, you can have 'em put down here.

No moping in this place - the vet walked in only 25 minutes late for our scheduled meeting, and didn't waste time with boring explanations or apologies - there are things to be done in a day, after all. She must have known that we'd paid in advance, and decided that speed was the order of the day.

She got right into Super Customer Service Mode, gave us a cheery a smile and asked in a bright voice "So! What are we doing?" and I have to be impressed with the sheer concentration manifested to blithely ignore not only the schedule, but also that room: two solemn-faced individuals gently cradling an old, blind chihuahua with tears on their faces isn't an easy thing to power through, but she managed it without batting an eye - didn't even phase her - that's experience, there.

This human female didn't mince around with the needle, either. I mean, some vets get so dainty when dealing with a small dog that the injection takes a full twenty or thirty seconds - she apparently had no time for that (I mean, she was obviously running at least 25 minutes behind schedule; we knew this was a busy day from 'go'.).

I reckon she doesn't see the point in sparing the injection on an animal that's going to die in a few minutes anyway, when there are other things to be done! So she really just jabbed it into the butt muscle and immediately plunged the syringe down - must have taken three seconds tops, during which this slow, tired dog whipped around and flailed in pain. Hadn't seen her move that fast in over a year.

She wanders back in fifteen minutes later with someone else, a bit more of a touchy-feely woman who obviously cares about animals. Don't you just hate it when you have to change gears because someone is watching? Only took three tries to find a vein for the lethal injection, and she announced death only a little prematurely - but it's not like this is an exact science or anything.

Yes, my tone is caustic and my review is laced with sarcasm. I'm too pissed to write it any other way just now, so I'll end it with this: if you want to see a friend die in needless pain at the hands of an unprofessional disrespectful woman of questionable ability and apparently no compassion who doesn't arrive on time... Well, you've found your place. This woman wasn't just a staff member; she's the owner.

In anticipation of denials - I don't know what kind of service you received, and I don't care. This is a factual recounting of what happened during the scheduled, please-let-us-be-engaged-and-respectful-about-this request I made ahead of time execution of a beloved friend... and this woman was anything but.

No email, no letter, no voicemail even extending a fake apology. Instead, she took our money, hurt our friend unnecessarily, and was just awful.

Roll the dice if you want, I guess. I'll never trust her again.</Text>< response>

I do not recommend them! We used them for a couple years with no problem, only using them for yearly visits since our dog was never sick. We recently got a new puppy and brought her in to be looked at the day after we bought her. They asked for a stool sample to test, which we provided. They said, "We'll only call if there is a problem with it." I never received a call, so I assumed she was fine. Two weeks later, she was very sick, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargic, and not gaining weight! I called the office to book her third puppy shot and they informed me that her medicine had been sitting there for 2 weeks!! "What medicine!?!?" Was my response. She said that my puppy had a parasite and they tried calling me. I never received a missed call or voice-mail. My husband and I were furious! We went in that day to pickup the meds, which we now had to get for both of our dogs because the parasite she has is very contagious. They never once apologized or offered to pay for the meds for our other dog. We asked for both our dogs records and will not be returning! Unless you're looking for careless veterinary care, do not go to Adobe!<//review>

I’ve been here a couple of times and those both times my family and myself were helped quickly and were treated with respect. Best service I’ve had in a while and everyone was super helpful. Amir is really there to help you out!!! Super friendly guy!!! My family and I are very happy with our purchase and we’ll continue purchasing at Corona Motors!!<//text>

I have Super Challenging Credit due to my tenure with Uber which I quit in 2017 after 4.5 years of driving for them. I had an accident and was out of work for quite some time which caused my credit to take a BEATING!!! I tried for a couple of weeks to get financed for a vehicle but kept getting denied. I went to Corona Motors as a last alternative.

The salesman named Amir was not only able to get m e financed, but was able to get me into the vehicle I WANTED. Amir really went to bat for me and got me approved in less than 24 hours and for the vehicle I wanted. Amir is "The Man!" I really appreciate ALL the hard work he put into getting me approved.

If you have challenging credit, go to Corona Motors and see Amir FIRST! Don't waste your time at other dealerships that make promises and FAIL. Amir DID NOT give em a Promise. He gave me a GUARANTEE that he will get me financed and was true to his word. Honestly, there is no excuse for going anywhere else other than Corona Motors. Amir WILL work HARD and Get You APPROVED!!!!!<//Text>

Couldn't be happier with Amir! Not super pushy as you would get with some car salesman. Let us look over the truck by ourselves without hovering. When we got in to talk numbers he was so informative, seeing as we only bought one other vehicle. Was able to get us the payments we wanted. Going home with a very ecstatic husband! Truck was spotless and clean on inside and out!
Thank you so much!< /text>

Just purchased our 2nd car from Amir and it couldn’t have been smoother. Although this time was a little different with masks and all we were in and out in less then an hour. Highly recommend Corona Motors to all in need of a reliable used vehicle.

If your in the Ontario area and need a great place with lots of selection, check these guys out. Amir was very helpful and pleasant to work with. He was very honest and upfront with me throughout the entire transaction.I did NOT feel like I was being taken advantage of like most dealerships do. Overall great experience and I will come back in the future.<//review>

Just came here the other day to buy a car, and the man that helped me, Amir, was AMAZING!!!! so helpful, understanding and open to help me look for Exactly what I wanted. Which was very important to me being that it was my first time buying. I would definitely recommend him to anybody I knew that was in the market for a reliable and affordable vehicle. Super great guy with a great personality !!! Ask for him when you get there you will not be disappointed</review>

I had an extremely pleasant experience with shopping for a newer truck with this company, Amir was absolutely fantastic on helping me through with my very first financed truck answered any and all of my questions I had. without any pressure to purchase, I will absolutely be coming here again for my next purchase without hesitation, the 2006 f350 they sold me is in fantastic condition.
THANK YOU!!

Update -  One Payment 6 weeks and 3234 miles later iv had to had my truck towed home today, iv already replaced one sensor on the truck which seemed to help, but after shutting the truck off to get fuel this morning it refused to start.  (I do not blame the dealer directly) I just wish I would of brought a certified mechanic with me to properly look it over before purchase, You always take a risk purchasing something that has 167k miles on it and I am definitely eating this one. Have your cars checked by someone qualified before you sign on that line.<//Text>

<Review>When it comes to cars, I simply won’t go anywhere else. Ask for Amir. He made my car buying experience the best yet. The friends I refer to him always come back with glowing reviews. The folks at Corona Motors are not only absolute wizards — they take the time to kindly walk you through the whole process.

<Text>Amir was a very nice dude and had great customer service, but sold us a truck with no maintenance  done on it. Looks good on the surface but it’s just to get a quick sale. Not even a month into owning our truck we did the brakes and there was no brake left on the pad AT ALL! They never did a simple freaking oil change. There wasn’t even a cabin air filter in the vehicle! We still have not received anything in the mail for the truck. No tags or license plate. We call and they refuse to give us straight answers about it all. If you’re going to cheat the system and not do the maintenance at least be honest about it so it can get done.<//Text>< Pics>

I dealt with AMIR and EUNIS -Excellent excellent excellent  customer service and thoughtfulness of my time and energy. They made sure everything in the vehicle was functioning properly and even delivered it to my home an hour away. Everyone was very responsive and polite. They even mailed spare keys that they found in their records to me after the fact. I most definitely would recommend and suggest dealing with corona motors. My Ford F150 is absolutely immaculate. They are very patient and answer all questions and made me very comfortable.< /Review>

Amir wasn’t The usual pushy used car salesman but allowed us to take our time. Ounce we got to the finance part, he worked a great strategy deal that we could afford. We are very happy with our purchase and look forward to many RV adventures with our new F250 diesel truck.

This company is a class act. I called them about a car I saw online. When I came down to the dealership, they didn't try to up sell me at all. It was for the exact same price that they listed online. I was in and out within an hour or so. Thanks.< /Text>

Hello everybody out there looking for a vehicle,
Corona motors is the place to go!!!I just recently had my motor go in my work truck and needed another truck right away but I only had so much to work with for my down payment And what I could afford monthly. I called and spoke with Adrian and some of his associates ( sorry if I forgot your names) agreed to meet later that day (with Adrian)anyway long story short I got the truck I wanted at a great rate and a payment lower than I had expected, there’s was no haggling what so ever basically told them what I had and about what I can afford and WOW!!!!! They exceeded my expectations. The staff there is awesome I highly recommend anyone looking for a used vehicle to go there.     Thank guys!!!!</text>

<text>There is no better car buying experience. Amir is as knowledgable and friendly as they come, and treats you like his own family. I've had nothing but positive things to say about my entire experience there, from finding the right car, to financing, to taking delivery, the guys at Corona Motors are dedicated to your needs. I've recommended all of my friends and family who are in need of a car to give them a call or visit them before anyone else. Thank you guys!<//text><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

Come to find out they were part of much bigger problems. The twin turbo is bad and the possibility of needing a new engine is most likely.  Ford made the 6.4 model's for only a short time because they are not a good truck. So I have had this thing for 5 months and need to put $26,000 into it just to have more problems later. That is what I am being advised by the several mechanics I have spoke to. I called to talk to the owners of this dealership and all I got was sorry there is nothing we can do for you. Even though I have records of the truck having these problems from the beginning. I am now stuck paying off a $19,000 loan and I have no vehicle to drive. Looks like my only options are take the hit or file bankruptcy.  Unfortunately from my experience with this dealership,  I would tell people to run away!! DO NOT BUY  ANY VEHICLE FROM THESE PEOPLE!!! All they will do I rob you and put you in debt.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

As we strive for an excellent customer experience, unfortunately we can't be responsible for issues on a 150k mile truck six months after it was sold. However we would be more than happy to assist with any problems you're having as i'm sure whatever the issue may be it can be done for a lot less then $26,000.\n\nThanks,\nManagement"}< /Response>

<text>Amir was the most honest and patient person, especially with me beingcbeing so distraught.  5days after purchase with some concerns and he took care of all of it.  Fixed everything and went above and beyond for me.  Mike spoke to me very calmly, which I clearly needed because I was concerned buying a 2016 higher miles I didn't understand but they.
made sure everything was taken care of.  I love my new car and I definitely recommend coming back for anyone or myself.  Thank you Amir for your integrity and patience and Mike for a good deal with everything worked out !< /text></record>

My 3rd purchase from Corona Motors. My first was in 2001 and Mike the General manager who just helped me purchase my third car assisted me in financing my first car 20 years ago! Delivered as promised and I am beyond happy with my new suv. I recommend to all in the area looking for a reliable used vehicle!

<review>Was looking for a car for about a month. First moment I spoke to someone at Corona Motors was when I found my perfect car. I spoke to someone named Amir and he helped me find the right car for my family and I. Even during the COVID restrictions, I was able to have all my
questions answered and was able to go in and leave with the car without any hassles.

I highly recommend you shop here. Call and speak to Amir and he will give you all the details you need in order for you to make a decision. Excellent professional service that I highly recommend!< /review>< Pictures>

Don’t inquire for a vehicle or apply for credit check online ! These guys will run your credit for a vehicle then sell it before they even process your credit report therefore dinging your credit and wasting your time . They will even promise you another vehicle then sell that one too. I should of believed the reviews when I read them .this place does not run a professional business, if I could I would give it 10 negative stars . A WORD TO THE WISE SHOP ELSEWHERE!!!!!!!!!!!!   BUYERS BEWARE!!!!</review>

{'time': 1592001787479, 'text': 'Hi Guadalupe,\nIm sorry to hear about your experience. As customer service is our #1 goal here at Corona Motors, we’re not able to put any cars on hold because its simply not fair to other prospective buyers and we would never keep someones deposit for simply changing their mind. Since 1999 we have been working on a first come first serve basis and we always make sure our clients are aware of this rule.\n\nI understand your frustration as you have been in the market since November of last year (at least thats when you first contacted us).\xa0\xa0It has now been over 6 months and you haven’t made a single trip down to physically check out our inventory of diesel trucks, yet get mad when the “perfect truck” of yours gets sold days after we ran your credit.\n\nPer our conversation the other day and as promised, we purchased three new diesel trucks for you to choose from and would love to assist you. Just be quick as they will not last long on our lot.\n\nThanks,\nManagement'}< /Response>

Definitely an interesting experience, Allan was delightfully friendly and incredibly helpful. We spent nearly 5 hours there and he made every second of our experience a memorable one. Would definitely recommend visiting this location if you're looking for warm, friendly staff. The car selection is a bit small but you'll definitely find something for everyone.< /Text>

< Review>
So lets start at the beginning,  I talked about a couple truck there and the gentleman on the phone was very helpful on what was available and details on them and what was already sold. We went down there to look at a truck but it wasn't quite what we were looking for. So Amir told me they would be getting in somemore soon. We keep in touch and also checked their website and found two that would work for us so we made another trip and finally picked out a nice truck that fit what were looking to do with it(slide in camper). They even took truck to upholstery shop to replace leather on arm rest. So the check engine light came on and they called me before we were to pick it up, they took it to repair shop and the turbo was replaced. We finally picked it up and we are extremely pleased with truck and all the staff at Corona motors. Its very rare to find honest car dealerships anymore. If you looking for a good truck or car you need to check this dealership first. Thank you Amir.<//Review>

<Review>Please see Krista's review below I am in the EXACT same situation. I bought a vehicle from them in January, and traded in a vehicle, which they agreed to pay the loan off on. It has been 2 months and they still have not paid off my trade-in. I have called at least 10 times, they have sent me 2 checks to make the payments (how unprofessional). This is absolutely ridiculous. I have left many messages and spoken with several people and I am always told "We will call you back in 30 minutes." Then I do not hear from them. While I love my current vehicle all of this other nonsense is maddening. My next move is to pursue legal action if this is not handled promptly. CALL ME BACK.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
My fiancée had been looking for a low mileage diesel engine 2500 truck. He saw Corona Motors on Facebook had a larger  2009 F350 with low miles, great condition and few prior owners.  Price had been lowered for 4th of July weekend, internet or FB special  and it was within range of his down payment.  Amir was the sales representative and answered his phone call over the weekend.  He said he could have the first look appt. on Monday 07/06,  he drove and  liked the truck and decided to purchase.  Amir was professional, attentive and answered both his and all my  questions and did not push his decision making process.  Amir completed and explained all the paperwork in simple, easy to understand language.  The finance man Mike, worked like a trooper to get him financed with a payment below what he expected to pay.  He was even able to get extended warranty coverage. We are pleased with the service and his purchase from Corona Motors.  Thank you Amir and Mike for your above and beyond service.</Review>

<review>They lied on interest rate to get me there, said theyd fix the issues w the truck once I bought it.    I've almost died 2 times now because they won't do the repair!   Or call me back.  I've made 1 payment....     I called it In w less than  the 250 miles  cut off too....  They arent honorable ppl...  Shady at best.    The owners or older guys are the shot callers.  They are cheap and dodge responsibility.   It's going to get myself or others killed.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Quick and easy service, were in and out with the car in an hour. Super friendly salesman Sam and manager Arman. We went to several big name dealerships to find used cars and had the worst possible experiences. These guys were super personable and friendly and no hassle at all. Overall had a much nicer experience than most car dealerships.< /text>

It was definitely a great experience working with Doug and Arman when purchasing the 2012 Jeep Liberty Sport. They were both very pleasant and worked in a timely manner to get us through the car buying process. The next time I'm in the market for buying another used car, I will most certainly go back to Corona Motors due to their honesty and integrity! Doug and Arman you're the BEST!!!<//review>

I have been trying to get them to pay off my old car loan since Dec. 27th and they will not. I have talked with them on the phone, even gone down there because they had to reimburse me for payment twice. If they do no pay off the car by the 16th, the payment will be missed and will thus affect my credit. When that happens, I will move forward legally and sue for damages. I never have left a negative review for ANYTHING EVER. They seem completely disorganized and unprofessional. I hope by posting this whoever has been responsing to reviews (which was as early as this week) will know how SERIOUS I am.<//text>

Their car's are no good at all DO NOT FALL for the Carfax banners. They will lie to you and lie to the banks about the contract. Once you sign the contract and you have car issues they will try hard to avoid the problem. They have alot of engine problems with all their car's. It's  crazy how the check engine light does not come on with all the issues they have 🤔. If I am able to give Zero stars that's would be my Rate for the Dealership, Car's and Staff.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I've been searching for a long time for a car. I've been to countless dealerships, and I have pretty sad credit. I've been told that there was no way I was going to get a car within the price range I wanted at the payment I wanted. Well, here at Corona Motors, Doug made it happen.

Doug was quick and efficient from the start showing us only what had the amenities we wanted in a price range he felt would give us the payment we wanted. To tell the truth, I fell in love with the red Nissan Rogue the moment I first sat down in it, and a test drive only cemented my love. That was my car. To my absolute joy, Doug worked with us and kept up on finance to get us off the lot in that beautiful Nissan Rogue.

It really was a wonderful experience, and Doug made it super easy for someone like me who was new to car buying. I am so proud to have finally financed a car all on my own. Thanks, Doug!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c333c801293f79:0xee56c9d49e526c02<//gmapID></record>

<Review>They are amazing. I had a really bad credit score back a couple months ago and they were the only dealership that approved me and worked about a week to do it and I got my dream car from them and it's feels and looks brand new, even helped when I need to get a new battery. Everyone there is so friendly and they do have a big selection. I was surprised when they had the one I wanted at an amazing deal. Highly recommended.</Review><user_id>118037261316738990433</user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures>< GmapID>

< Review>
I was a little apprehensive at first and I asked a LOT of questions about the 2013 Mazda 3 before I bought it.

I noticed that the driver seat belt was pretty messed up and the back tires were cupping pretty bad. I told my sales associate Bill about it and they hooked it up with 4 brand new tires and an OEM Mazda Seat Belt.

I also checked and the fluids were all topped off and the oil's consistency looked like it just had a fresh oil change. I would recommend checking these things before buying any used car.

They tried hard to get me into a car right away and they were able to get me a loan with a really decent APR even though I had a bankruptcy and repo on my record.

If your credit is in bad shape, I would recommend coming to these guys. They'll do everything they can to get you into a car that you want. If you find any issues with the vehicle just tell them about it and they'd more than happy to help.</Review>

I went to buy a car the other day and I noticed touch up paint on most of the cars. Had a mechanic inspect a car I was interested in, and found electrical issues. I told them about it, and was even insulted. One of the salesmen even told me "do you want to take this outside?" When we actually we're standing outside. What a moron!! Don't do business here! Super unprofessional, and ghetto!< /review>

Very Good Experience.  I purchased 2012 Camry and I am very happy with it.  Mike's service was excellent and he was very helpful when some small issues came up.  They have good selection of cars at very reasonable prices.</text>

<review>The salesman, Sal seemed very impersonal. I didn't feel like I was really welcomed and he didn't know very much about the car I was driving. The owner was the one who welcomed me and he seemed great. Just shady salesmen.< /review>< Rate>

This Dealer is horrible..some of their reviews are fake they were done by themselves...they sold me a Chrysler 300 that wouldn't pass smog ,they took it to a shop that passed the car for them and then they put it on the lot and reset the car settings with a dead battery. Called them out about it and  they had all kinds of excuses either way i learned my lesson never buy from a ghetto dealer ...and No i do not recommend this dealer your better of going to craigslist<//review>

My experience was so positive, my dealer knew exactly what he was doing, they let me drive the car around like it was already mine, made me feel very comfortable, and at ease, the easiest car buying experience I've ever had. Thank you

The guys at Corona Motors sold me a diesel truck in July 2012. I was new to Diesel engines and when I saw it smoking they told me it was normal for a diesel. I believed them because it made sense. But I've now been told by numerous diesel guys that this is not normal. So I took it to a couple shops. They've told me that all 8 injectors are bad. They don't all go bad suddenly so there's no way that Corona Motors didn't know there was a problem and they even somehow managed to get it smogged. I'm being told now that it couldn't possibly have passed inspection with it smoking this bad. DON'T GO THERE. THEY LIE AND CHEAT.<//Text>

Where do I even begin with this place? Their cars will literally break down days after buying a car. They DO NOT help you and they never know what's wrong with it , they always say "I'm not a mechanic so I don't know what to tell you". Skip this place if you're interested in getting a car that ACTUALLY RUNS! Yes they have beautiful cars, but THEY DO NOT WORK! They only offer a 30 day warranty because they know their cars are GARBAGE! It's a huge headache getting a car from them. I TRULY regret getting a car from them because the cost in repairs for my car is $2,800-$5,000+! So think before coming here, you are adding a car payment to your monthly bills, DO YOU REALLY WANT TO ADD THOUSANDS MORE TO GET THAT SAME CAR FIXED?!? PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE!< /review>

Service is bad, outrageously unprofessional, cars have multiple problems, horrible customer service. I was sold a lemon and when taken the car back due to having more than several problems, the owner, Mike, decided to take my car for a joy ride a couple of days after getting it back from their mechanics and he got multiple toll rode violations in my car. I had the car less than five months of purchase and was already almost $800 deep in repairs and that was just the start of the repairs. I cannot believe this business, they have lost all my business and I hope you find a better used car dealership before even considering going to corona motors.< /text>

We all know what a hassle the car purchasing process can be, Well here at Corona Motors, they do everything they can to make it smooth and painless.  Corona Motors has an exceptional staff with remarkable customer service and the desire to go above and beyond.  Amir is a fantastic man, Sexy, and is AMAZING!  He was able to work with my situation and fit me into a sexy car that I never dreamed of owning.  The entire staff at Corona Motors have exceptional Customer service and friendly demeanors.  These guys are awesome!!!</review>

<userid>103251473778950373952<//userid><text>I certainly appreciated the assistance and help I received when I visited the Corona Motors lot to look for a car. Before we got into looking at cars the gentlemen that helped me ... Amir Jafari ... went over my financial situation and pre approved me with a car that I knew I could afford. It was important for him to give me a car I can afford so as to now struggle anymore than I have in the past.

During the process of finding said car Amir was very patient in my selection process and when I did find something I liked he showed me the carfax (without me even asking for it)

The whole process was rather nice and went smoothly. I would definitely get another car from them and would certainly recommend others doing the same.</text><Response>None< /Response>< username>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Terrible service! From the beginning they treat you very well so that you buy, I bought a truck and it came out defective, they are only taking me long to fix it, more than 3 weeks with the truck parked and they only say I speak to you, they do not speak to me I have to go talking to them. Normally you buy a vehicle to use it, in my case no, 3 weeks with the truck if I have driven it 2 times is a lot, his mechanic has been saying that the part does not arrive, when the part is sold in Autozone, you do not even need to order because they have it in stock. In addition, it is not the only problem that the truck has (it is throwing oil and water), it is more than obvious that they did not check it and they solved the problems it had before putting it on sale, with the folder and the truck looking clean enough. For them, I personally lack professional ethics that they only care about selling and not about the well-being of their clients. I already made my first payment, because as I say to the finance company I am not going to give you the payment because the truck cannot handle it, it can't be true. Caution !! before buying, better take your mechanics before because later this becomes a headache.

Pesimo servicio! De principio te tratan muy bien para que compres,compre una troca y salio defectuosa, solo me estan dando largas para arreglarla, mas de 3 semanas con la troca estacionada y ellos solo dicen yo te hablo, no me hablan yo tengo que andar hablandoles.Normalmente compras un vehículo para utilizarlo ,en mi caso no, 3 semanas con la troca si la he manejado 2 veces es mucho, su mecanico lleva diciendo que la pieza no llega, cuando la pieza la venden en Autozone, ni siquiera se necesita ordenar porque la tienen en existencia. Ademas no es el unico problema que tiene la troca(esta tirando aceite y agua) es mas que obvio que no la revisaron y solucionaron los problemas que traia antes de ponerla a la venta,con que la carpeta y la troca se vean limpia es suficiente para ellos, en lo personal se me hace una falta de etica profecional que solo se preocupen por vender y no por el bienestar de sus clientes. Yo ya hice mi primer pago, porque como le digo a la finaciera no te voy a  dar el pago porque la troca no la puedo maneja, no se puede verdad. Precaucion!!antes de comprar, mejor lleven a sus mecanicos antes porque despues esto se convierte en un dolor de cabeza.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>(Translated by Google) 1 month ago I bought a ford escape 2012 is my third car in corona motors this last time the attention was better in a matter of time they have always treated me in a good way but this time it was improved they resolved me in less than 2 hours they greatly improved the interests that I was charged in other deler I recommend you look for CHAVA that young man if he knows how to treat a car buyer all well explained and without much money to try to convince you

Lovely little local Mexican spot with character. Good food, and as authentic as it gets. $1.99 tacos. What a pleasure to have found this gem while road-tripping the pacific coast highway.</Text>

I love this place! Family owned and the personell is always super friendly! They have a HUGE variety of food, from Burgers, to Mexican food, salads, sandwiches and Breakfast ALL DAY! For those who are bikers and pass through Guadalupe they let you store your bike while you eat, they have wi-if and if that’s not enough they let you charge your electronic devices!

<text>I ordered Panda earlier today, I had a missing item I ordered steak and shrimp and there was one shrimp, the serving size for the entree were like a table spoon. The most disgusting thing out of all of this is that there was a roach in my food.</text><rating>1</rating>< Name>

<text>Had the kung Pao chix , orange chix  . They were both delicious, but the portions were horrendous, in the kung Pao  , I only had two little tiny pieces of chicken and mostly peanuts,  the orange 🍊 chicken 🍗 was a little better but not by much.  For paying over $13 Dollars per person I spect better portions and no tiny ones,  I am still hungry and totally disappointed,  I am going somewhere else to eat,   PANDA XPRESS you are killing us.< /text>< pics>

Not too long of a wait in line. Wanted to try the new steak and shrimp dish. The steaks were not strips but small chunks. The steak tasted ok but somehow they must have forgotten that the dish included shrimp. We also ordered orange chicken all 6 pieces. Overall not thrilled with the portions for $8.30. I'll go back to a real Chinese restaurant.<//text>

Cheaper than I thought, and more food than expected. All in all I'll give it 5 stars. There's always room for improvement.< /Text>

<Review>The entrance for online orders is the door marked "exit only". I waited in line for the entrance and was told to go to the other line. Food is good,  like any other Panda Express,  but I'll probably just drive farther next time.

*UPDATE
They fixed the signage, make sure to have confirmation email ready on your phone for faster pickup.< /Review><GmapID>0x80d94dd53d89abe3:0xb6b24576e16721de<//GmapID>< Pics>

Customer service was very good.  Just decided to stop in for  a quick bite.  The Good thing about chain restaurant.  You can count on them being very similar.  Its exactly what I wanted =)   The price is not bad.  And This is the only time I have been to this location.   But  I would not mind going there again.  The only down side is that it was a little small.  Also Sorry did not take many food pictures this time around..  only the kids meal i bought my little girl.  Was chow main and Grilled chicken, no sauce, (this is the chicken they use for the teriyaki chicken, which is what I had).<//Review>

Ive been here 2 times already in the past month. And sadly, this place it cheap. I mean their servings are a little under ok... border line stingy. I go to Panda Express about once a week but to the one on 9862 Mission Gorge Rd in Santee. NOW there, man let me tell you! They serve you good! Great size portions and the girls are always friendly! I love going there, they really know how to treat a customer. So that is why I go out of my way to take my hard earned money there! Sadly this Panda Express is not cutting it. I don't want to be back, but depending on the circumstances, I may go back. If they do a better job, I will up my 2 star rating.<//review>

Wife was disappointed with the small portions of steak and shrimp that are given for the price that you pay.</Review>

The honey walnut shrimp was very mushy on the outside. I am a frequent either at panda and this was the worst I’ve received from them. Don’t think I’m going to eat there anymore you can’t even contact the manager to make a complaint and I have noticed that when I was in the store one time the manager just let the phone ring. She would not answer it very poor customer service for iamb a customer service specialist and knows what it takes to satisfy customer apparently they don’t!</Review>< Pictures>

Panda is one of my favorite places for cheap and tasty food, plus in there you can make healthier choices if you wanted to. In my last visit, I had a plate with the mixed veggies and double green bean chicken breast, so delicious and every person in there is kind and helpful.< /review>

I’d like to say that I never eat at Panda Express and I went twice today and the first time I went in I was waiting on a couple items. The second time I went in I was waiting for all4items. I was so disappointed I hope it’s not always like that so I talked to Blanca and she remembered me from the first time and I explained to her and she understood and was able to compensate me for waiting 30 min. Thank you Blanca for your patience and customer services!</Review>

<Text>The food is not that great. I definitely had to use the toilet if you know what I mean. No, I did not have food poisoning or anything or else this review would be one star, just saying this food is not the best and it runs right through you. I would have put 2 stars but when I chose the shrimp entrée and tasted it and did not like it (it was not good), I went back (dined in) to exchange it for something else and they did so without hesitation. So I have to give them credit for that even though that too (the entrée that I exchanged it for) was also not good. As I mentioned before we dined in, we had to clean the seats and table ourselves. The seats and tables were dirty and sticky. 1 star deduction for cleanliness and 2 star deductions for food but 1 star added for customer service.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Ok, going back here was a HUGE disappointment. Panda Express has gone totally commercialized and lost all credibility and patronage by me. The food is lacking in quality and taste. I'm very upset by this because it is a place we visited at least 8 times per month. What happened Panda Express?< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I love the orange chicken, mushroom chicken, and fried rice with chow mein. Customer service is fast and consistent. Any time we have a problem they're quick to fix it and the food always tastes great. This is definitely the best Panda Express.</text>

<Text>They forgot to put orange chicken and teriyaki  sauce on both my orders. The portion sizes were very small comapared to what they usually do. Went in to the store so they can fix their miatake's and there was no manager at the store  so their solution to my problem was to call the manager on the phone so they can tell me they can't help me. No manager, not good customer service, food portions are not fair to the price and the employee I spoke to said she couldn't help me because there was nobody in charge. Two stars for the pretty girl at the register<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80d94dd53d89abe3:0xb6b24576e16721de</gmapID></record>

Everytime I go here it just keeps getting worse. Order the plate that is supposed to come with two entrees. One was the Angus steak that I got charged $1.25 extra for, but was given mostly mushrooms and onions. The amount of meat given is in the top part of the box in pic. The other entree was supposed to be sweet fire. You do not see it in the picture because they never put any in the plate. So I got charged extra for something that I didn't even get a normal amount of and also didn't get any of the other entree. When this same location had the sesame Chicken they would use the wrong chicken and then would charge extra to customers still.-woupd not let me add the pics, but there is only for small pieces of steak.<//Text>

Very disappointed with my last visit. I ordered online and they took 10 more minutes than the estimated time but the real problem was when I arrived customer service was not good, everyone was in a bad mood. The food was no good either the chow mein was undercooked. I will not be coming to this location anymore.< /text>

(Translated by Google) My poor opinion of the rice is undercooked, it is somewhat hard and apart from changing the menu it was a good idea.
