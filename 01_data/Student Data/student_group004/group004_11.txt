< Review>
I had traveled from afar through the scortching desert, my rations long gone, I had heard of their deals. They didnt disappoint! Awesome place! Sara (without an "H" hehe:) , Shelby and of course Joy (of Joy of Life) were all incredibly warm , knowledgable, and friendly while still professional. Thank you my new friends I'll see you soon!</Review>

<review>Just curious as to how they are getting away with five star ratings on product that is cheaper and better quality with higher THC counts right down the street from here. I’ve just browsed the menu but haven’t gone there. For 60 an eighth I would expect there to be some Live music playing with dinner included to get 5 stars. Super weird but kind of funny. Try Green Dragon or the Flower Market. It will change your Cannabis experience and your pocketbook for the better</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<text>They take legitimate reviews and flood them with troll accounts to flag the real reviews. This has been going on for 3 years now. Green Dragon is the best storefront in Palm Springs  25 dollar top shelf indoor eighths when they are on sale which as of late has been consistent. Other than that use the delivery services. The flower market is one of them. Much better offers.< /text><user_name>Toucan Pwaythis<//user_name>< Rating>

<Review>Contrary to what the bitter Betty said, it is not the most expensive in the valley, they are one of the few places that won’t deceive  by putting low prices then,  oh wait there’re  the taxes which make it more than what you would pay if you just went here.  This is an honestly run business whose pricing is upfront and includes the taxes so you know exactly how much you are spending.  He’s probably an ex employee or someone who was turned down for employment with an ax to grind.  No I did not get “paid” for telling the truth in this review.</Review><user>108000525840092944057< /user>< pictures>

My experience was awesome, had the cream I was looking for which provided immediate relief to some extreme back pain.  Thank you to all at Joy of Life - I will be a repeat customer. Very knowledgeable and friendly ladies. And a HUGE thank you to Joy.
See you all again next month.

Being from out of state, I chose Joy's because of the good reviews & how calm it seemed.  Every person we encountered made the first time experience so much better.  So many warm faces.  It is worth the 15 hour drive to get here, they were all THAT amazing.< /review>

They usually have a very expansive inventory (for such a small place). The real reason I love coming here is the bud tenders. They have great suggestions and they make you feel at home. I’ve never not left this place smiling. So the name says it all: Joy of Life.</text>

I was a little disappointed in the weed I purchased here yesterday. The price was right but it was dry and not very good😞 It was my first time here. The girl that took care of me didn't show me more options on other product that might have been better.<//Review>

Nice flat easy going loop trails with 360° views. Great place to watch sunsets. I have seen lots of different birds, including owls! I have also spotted what looked like a coyote. Trails are extra wide making it easy to social distance. Stay out of the tall grass cause there are ticks. Good alternative to the preserve if it's not open.< /text>

<Text>First time doing this Hike/Jog. I also had the chance to take up my Drone. Not crowded at all. A bit windy, but what can you expect when you're near the Bay. The warning sign about Ticks sure is APPROPRIATE for this place. Maybe even naming it "Tick Bay Park"?...< /Text><Rating>4< /Rating>< user>

Easy and flat trail. Once you park, just follow the trail along the fence. As others have stated... no shade along the entire trail. Good walk, but not too exciting. Grab a beer at Mare Island Brewery when you're done!</text>

<date>1526434650811< /date><Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Gravel Trail that walks towards the water with historical military and current nature facts. There are benches that you can sit and enjoy the view looking out on the water and the hills on the other side. Not many people only saw two making it beautiful quite and a good walk! My father and I went and even though we stayed on the trail getting slightly close to the grass while sitting on the benches we both came home with four ticks total. If the trail was a bit more groomed it would be a 5 Star Adventure!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv-Ax28xnysERda73Qw5erq0-rRLcKNYKb4kry=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUjb__pGbzxRxr1tJxd-uZSMElTV1xTWDv1OeZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6jnHBODtS6t_vxugcfxsAcekZKrwz6ilEY1Rm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSNGL0IVMGPbROWGVuBykJljT_drEhcmPahw-L=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTqevqGvIpw3KXvWPTcmX9MPdsYrBXw0wXEvdq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJJVcpHi3940qa75G0GgYOJz5A8GleaHsz_ryY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

<Review>Robert Jensen review is correct but it's one of the few places in that city kept up on keeping the slum attitude of dumping for others to care of have not taken over in vallahole.
I've seen maybe 5 varieties of birds of prey, turkeys are now common as everywhere, coyotes, and waterfowl thrive. It's a fortunate save for the area that people can walk daily.
The rest of the end of the island should be opened yet short term gain is expected by the present mayor in relationship to developing more living spaces for higher achievers, which Vallejo energy is depressive and trashed by its own dwellers. I can see where gentrification would uplift the face of the classic victorians of the place before they are ground down to no value dust. But these people also appreciate open space to walk job and breath.<//Review>< pics>

<review>cool views of the bay and lots of cool bird life. Definitely a bit strange to have essentially a toxic hill in the center of the trail loop but it beats walking or running on the roads. Also it is listed as "no bike" but there is no apparent reason for that. The trail is road width and smooth enough to ride a road bike on.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

This is an easy 3mile loop with lots of birds and good views of My. Tam to the west as well as My. Diablo. If you like a bit more of an up hill hike try the preserve also on Mare island.</Review>

<rating>3<//rating><Text>(Translated by Google) The season we went to may have been bad (summer is in the wilderness), but it was hot, the iron fences continued endlessly, the flat scenery was boring, the bees approached the buzzing and it was noisy, and the end of San Pablo Bay The view was not so refreshing and it was not a very enjoyable hike.

(Original)
行った季節が悪かったのかも知れませんが（夏は枯野です）、暑いし、鉄柵が延々と続く、平坦な景観も退屈だし、蜂がブンブン近寄ってきて物騒だし、辿り着いたサンパブロ湾の眺めもイマイチ爽快感に欠けるし、あまり楽しいハイキングにはなりませんでした。</Text>< pictures>

<review>The used tires have 80% or mor life left on them. Prices are reasonable and better then competition in the area. This is a family business and they treat you like one.< /review>< Name>

The 711 here is by far the best! They are always very kinda, helpful, and courteous. The entire staff is fantastic. The morning gals always start peoples day with a smile the afternoon shift is always so kind as well. The night shift guy well he's by far the best! He always plays fantastic music at night:)<//Review>

<text>This is a hidden gem worth a visit. I'm talking about the Mexican restaurant. The prices are very reasonable, the portions epic and quality fantastic. The dining facility is modest, but clean. If your in the area it's totally worth the trip.< /text>< Time>

It's got a 7-Eleven with gas pumps, a Mexican restaurant, but best of all it has wow Donuts. It's my personal belief that the donut shop is the best in Lakeside. They close at 12 as normally by then they're sold out< /text>

There isn't much to this spot, just a a 7-11, a donut shop and a taco place, but it always seems to be busy with locals, workers and visitors passing through. The 7-11 was family owned and operated by a very nice gentleman for many years, I don't know if that is still the case, but the staff is still friendly.< /Text>

Dr. JJ is a God-send truly! I was looking for a chiropractor who I would be comfortable with and someone who was trained in the Webster Technique. I also have scoliosis so wanted to make sure it would be safe. After doing several searches I decided to try out Radiant Family Chiropractic and it was one of the best decisions I made during my first pregnancy! I came in at 26
wks with some back aches and round ligament pain. Dr. JJ made me feel very comfortable from the start and explained how the process works as well as the benefits of getting adjusted during pregnancy. After the first adjustment I immediately felt the difference with my body. The aches and pains I had went away so I started coming in once a week. I am now about to be 39 wks pregnant and I can honestly say that after that first adjustments I haven’t had any back pains which is incredible since before pregnancy I would usually have lower back pain (most likely because of my scoliosis). Rarely did I have groin or round ligament pain either and when I did it was during the time when my next appt was coming up which was nice.

I can’t thank Dr. JJ enough for helping me with this pregnancy. She is like a friend and has put me at ease. I look forward to continue getting adjusted by Dr. JJ and she will likely be adjusting my baby too!!< /text>

Dr. Jarrah has been nothing but amazing at taking care of my mom's back and other alignment issues.  Her adjustments help my mom a great deal. She is also a wonderful person who cares a great deal for each of her patients.  We truly appreciate her and feel very fortunate to have met her.</text>

<review>Dr. JJ has been a health saver. I never considered going to a chiropractor until I hurt my lower back in 2019 I was in immense pain and was suggested by a friend to try it out. I was nervous the first time as the pain was extreme and was worried it would aggravate it. She was gentle and slowly adjusted me. That night I had less sciatica pain and was hooked! Now 1 1/2 years later I still see her to help keep my body feeling well... it’s almost like a mini massage for my bones.
If you’re wondering if seeing a chiropractor would be beneficial for you, I say try it out! I’m so happy I did.<//review>< Pics>

I started seeing Dr. JJ when I was three months postpartum (two years ago) and she helped support my body in so many amazing ways. She is extremely knowledgeable and has such a unique healing touch, I’ve never felt so “put back together,” after a chiropractic visit, as I do with her. I have continued to see her and very much look forward to each visit!<//Review>

Dr. JJ is a fantastic resource. She makes my entire family comfortable during our chiropractic visit, and we always feel better after an adjustment from her. She is a wealth of knowledge, and is great with kids - especially  infants and toddlers.</Text>

<review>I’ve been seeing Dr.JJ for a few months now after a friend recommended her. She is fantastic. I go every week (am now 35 weeks) and it has alleviated my sciatica and stiffness significantly. Whenever it starts to creep up, my appointment is usually within a day or two-so it’s been perfect.  It relieves so much stress and pressure on the back like you wouldn’t believe. She also is a wealth of knowledge on day to day to improve the back issues and prenatal stuff. You get so much more insight than at the OBGYN.<//review>< pics>

<Review>I started going here last week and noticed a big difference in the pain I had chronically around my back. Pain has significantly decreased and it has been years since I didn’t feel any pain in my back after workouts (squats/deadlifts). I also suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome and woke up without any numbness to both arms. Front desk receptionist Stephanie was also very polite and professional. Great experience, take advantage of your FSA and invest in yourself!</Review>< pics>

Dr. JJ is amazing. She is personable and makes you feel comfortable and relaxed while getting adjusted. She makes it easy to get an appointment and Stephanie is easy to schedule with. I always have to make changes to my schedule and they are accommodating. I moved out of state and come back to get adjusted.  👌
Her COVID-19 practices are great too.</Review>

Dr. JJ helped me to breastfeed again! My son was only two weeks old when he got introduced to Dr. JJ. At that time he tried to heal from his frenectomy that had been done soon after his birth. However, the healing process was hard on him. He dealt with a lot of pain in his mouth and therefore refused to drink from the breast right after his lip and tongue tie release. He was very weak and sleepy as he tried to preserve his energy to heal and I was devastated thinking that I would not be able to get him even close to my breast at all anymore. Dr. JJ performed Cranial Sacral Therapy on my son and on that very evening I was successful in breastfeeding again. It was the second time that I have seen immediate positive results after Cranial Sacral Therapy as I had this done on my daughter soon after she was born as well. Dr. JJ is very talented, experienced, and loves what she does. You could not be in any better care!< /review>

<Text>I'll follow Dr. Jumana Jarrah ANYWHERE. I've worked in the chiropractic industry for 8+ years and have had my fair share of Chiropractic adjustments during this time. Dr. J is hands down the best Chiropractor whose ever worked on me. She. Gets. Results. But even more than results - she CARES. It's not a quick "in-and-out" adjustment like so many other offices out there these days, all about the money and volume of patients - it's about the quality of care. Quality results. Lasting results and a healthy lifestyle.

I kickbox 4-5 days a week and I work at a desk 40+ hours a week. With my lifestyle, it's easy to get out of alignment, feel sluggish and tight.
I've seen Dr. J for both acute care and maintenance care. I've had emergency appointments when I was almost unable to walk due to misalignment and pinched nerves and she got me back up and working out. I've had days when I just felt tight and needed her magic adjustments to loosen me up.
I remember once I cried in her office because the pain was so bad when a vertebra sorta 'popped out of alignment' (my non-medical version of what happened) and after a few visits it was like nothing ever happened.

I cannot express enough how important it is that you see Dr. J, even if you're new to Chiropractic and want to see what it's all about. She'll set the bar pretty high and you will compare every other adjustment to her amazing work.

When I see her, I book well in advance. Though she says I can come 1-2x a month, I choose to come every other week because it's my "me" time, and I always feel so good after a visit.

Come see Dr. J. You wont regret it.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80d9556e396d2259:0x249c40eec1ed4be5< /gmap_id></record>

<review>Not Just For Injuries!
Dr. JJ is amazing! I have been seeing her for over 5 years now and she has helped me so much. She is kind and non-judgmental; she truly cares about your well-being and wants you to feel better. I deal with chronic pain from a few different chronic illnesses (fibromyalgia, neuropathy, sciatica, ect.) and I am so thankful to have found Dr. JJ and her healing hands. While my case may not be typical, I feel like a different person since I started seeing Dr. JJ. I was in so much pain I could barely walk, I carried a cane with me and my depression was at an all time low. I started seeing improvement quickly; I was able to reduce my medications and my depression lifted (full remission after 15+ years) because my pain went from a daily 7-8 to days being as low as a 3-4. I've tried every medication and physical therapy the docs could prescribe, even high dose narcotics, and nothing has helped as much as Dr JJ. I wish I had found her sooner. I can't thank you enough Dr. JJ!</review>< UserId.>

I had an amazing experience with Dr Jarrah. She listened to all my concerns and paid full attention to my pain areas. She did a conclusive evaluation on the whole body and explained the causes. She then adjusted the whole body( not just neck and sacrum like other chiros do) she is on fire and I loved it! She is very confident of her knowledge and treatments! You can tell she loves her work ❤️ I’m referring all my family and friends to her now!<//text>

She is absolutely incredible. My family started seeing her when my oldest was just a few months old due to issues with "hip dysplasia".
Because of her amazing work and great care my daughter NEVER had to wear one of those aweful harnesses and was deemed hip dysplasia free after a few months of adjustments and some very clever suggestions to help us avoid that horrible harness DR.'s we're "certain" she needed.
She always took care to make sure we (and our baby) we calm, comfortable and ready for adjustments. When we got pregnant with our next baby, I knew exactly where we'd be going. There was literally no one else I could consider. She helped keep me healthy, aligned and feeling good during a draining pregnancy. My second home birth was flawless and I'm convinced it is in part due to the great care we received. Now my kids are older and still love going in for an adjustment. We moved out of state then came back to SD and Radiant Family Chiropractic was one of the first places I reached out to in order to re-establish phenomenal care for my family.
Look no further. You've found the Best San Diego has to offer.

Ever since I have been working from home, I have been having intense back and neck pain. I began becoming dependent on pain medication and I did not want to continue with that habit. I was referred to Dr. Jarrah from a client of mine and I am very glad I make an appointment with her. She is very friendly, knowledge and took the time to address my concerns and I am finally out of pain! Thank you for all you do!< /Review>

I saw Dr Jarrah when I was pregnant with twins and experiencing back pain and sciatica. I had never seen a chiropractor and walked away from my first appointment feeling immediately better. She has a wonderful bedside manner, listens to your concerns, she’s gentle and she caters each treatment to your needs. I was nervous but her calm, friendly demeanor helped me relax. I also had a smooth labor and I attribute that to seeing her in the last few weeks to adjust my pelvis. My experience exceeded my expectations. I would recommend her to anyone!<//text>

Dr. J is the most knowledgable and accommodating physician I am honored to know over the last 7 years. Dr. J has a wonderful energy and her smile will ease any anxiety, she has that one factor many physicians do not have, patience to thoroughly listen. She has Unmatched credibility, expertise, and diligence. She IS wonderful!!!  Monty Sunshine Brewer< /Text>

I absolutely love how inviting and sweetly Jumana cares for our little ones as she walks them through a fun and kid friendly adjustment. She is an amazing mother in that way. I will follow her wherever she goes because she just knows how to hone in right on the need. I always walk out confident and fully adjusted! Mood, attitude and spine. Love<//review>

Dr. JJ helps with my lower back pain from sitting so much at work. She also provides guidance on posture awareness so that I can maintain the adjustments she makes. Highly recommended to anyone that deal with lower back pains from sitting down for long periods on a consistent basis. Very friendly, warm/welcoming, and affordable!< /review>

<text>I recently moved from Minnesota to San Diego, and after leaving my long time trusted chiropractor I was nervous to trust another. After making and cancelling a few appointments with other chiropractors, I finally found Dr. JJ at Radiant Family Chiropractic and was beyond relieved. I left my first appointment thinking “Yay! I found me person out here.” It is truly a huge relief to find someone you trust to care for your body. Dr JJ is a dream come true. Look no further.</text>< pics>

Dr. JJ is THE BEST chiropractor I've ever had. After seeing her for a set of four adjustments my range of motion was better than ever before. She gives attention to my entire body, not just my spine, and evaluates any changes in my posture to see what she may need to adjust or work on next. I'm very happy with her and will definitely be continuing my adjustments at Radiant Family.< /review>

<Review>Once I started seeing Dr. J I couldn't stop sharing her name with those around me that had pain, My best friend and Husband eventually became her customers as well. My husband had been suffering from pain in his side for 10+ years and Dr J was the first person to actually make a difference and help him to heal and feel normal for the first time in years!

She takes such personal interest in your individual health, she is caring and kind and always willing to take a little extra time with you to go over stretches or things you can do to help improve your body so that you have lasting results.

Couldn't gush more about how much our relationship with Dr J has impacted our health, and would recommend her to anyone looking for a Chiropractor!<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Pics>

I cannot recommend Dr. JJ enough! Because of my history with back pain and scoliosis, I knew I would need support when I became pregnant with my first child. Dr. JJ came highly recommended by my doula team (Day and Night San Diego - highly recommend too!) for help in pain management, alignment and setting myself up for a successful natural birth plan. I started seeing JJ during my second trimester and wow - what an immediate difference she made. I went from feeling constantly stiff and dealing with severe sciatic pain to no pain and feeling stronger than ever. My weekly adjustments also included general, holistically-minded recommendations for a smooth pregnancy and delivery. JJ made me feel confident and strong after each visit due to her positive and upbeat demeanor. Even through the peak of COVID-19, JJ practiced strict sanitation practices that made me feel safe to continue to see her. I am happy to report that I navigated a low-risk and generally pain-free 2nd and 3rd trimester, and a smooth labor and delivery! I credit JJ so much for helping me keep my body strong, aligned and in optimal shape for birth. Now that my healthy, happy daughter is here, we are going back to JJ for adjustments for both my baby and I! I trust JJ immensely in caring for my family's chiropractic needs and highly recommend her care for all conscious mommas looking for feel great throughout pregnancy... and postpartum as well!< /text>

I'm a healthy 27yr old who has been struggling for months with shortness of breath. I went to countless doctors (7 to be exact) and it wasn't until i saw Dr.Jarrah that i FINALLY found relief!!! She asked me so many intentional questions at the start to understand exactly what was happening and her response was, "we will do whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this and figure out what is wrong". That was the first time a doctor had told me that. After the FIRST visit i finally found relief. I wanted to cry. I can't speak more highly of her. She is extremely patient, knowledgable, kind, and just an all around amazing doctor and human. She goes above and beyond for every patient she has, she even makes herself available after office hours. If i could give her 10 stars i totally would! YOU MUST SEE HER! THE BEST!</Review>

I was a little skeptical about chiropractic treatment, but after reviews and recommendations I decided to give it a try. The first time I met Dr JJ she was very professional but also had that home feel vibe to her making you feel comfortable leading to the treatment. She does fantastic work and my family and I are always look forward to seeing her at the end of the week to press that reset button to start the new. Thank you Dr JJ.</review>

Dr. JJ was recommended to me by my doula. My situation was crazy, basically  I needed to see a women’s health chiropractor in that knows how to do the Webster technique so I can try and turn my baby from breech to cephalic presentation and I was moving from San Diego within a week to a smaller city that doesn’t have a chiropractor that specializes with Webster’s.  Dr. Jj was VERY flexible and got me into her office for 2 sessions in one week. She has a welcoming personality. She is knowledgeable and professional. You can tell she loves what she does!
I wish I could take her with me to my new home town!!</Text>

<Text>Dr. JJ is the absolute best! I took my baby at 3 months bc of a stiff neck. She was always looking to one side. Our pediatrician checked it out, said she saw the problem but suggested to just wait it out. As someone who has had spinal problems all my life, I didn’t want to leave it to become a bigger problem for my baby. Dr. Jarrah pinpointed the problem and adjusted her maybe 4 times and corrected the problem. I would have loved to continue seeing her but unfortunately we moved out of state. Don’t hesitate checking her!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<text>Dr. Jarrah is a wonderful chiropractor and human. I work an office job and spend way too much time staring at a screen with improper posture and holding my stress in my shoulders/neck. I used to have chronic headaches, but after a headache that lasted three days I finally decided enough was enough and went to Dr JJ on a friend's recommendation. I instantly felt at ease with her (which sure helps when it comes to the neck adjustments!), and to this day we always have great conversations whenever I come in for an adjustment. It's been almost a year since my first appointment with Dr. Jarrah and I still come in about once per month for maintenance, but my headaches are nowhere near as frequent or as severe as they were before. We have a usual series of adjustments she does for me now, but she always pays attention if I note something in particular is bothering me, or if she notices an area that probably would start bothering me soon, and adjusts her treatment accordingly, which says a lot about both how much she cares about her patients and her professional knowledge of how to treat whatever is ailing you. I can't say enough good things about Dr JJ as a person and her chiropractic care!!<//text><UserId.>111879510940194281087< /UserId.>< time>

<Review>Our family LOVES starting our weekends off with an adjustment from Dr JJ.

I work in a dental office and my head/neck posture can be in weird positions for an hour+, so by the end of my work week... I’m left with this pounding headache, achy neck & sore wrists. My body is just begging to be put back into alignment. After my weekly visit with Dr Jj, and that AMAZIIIIIIINGGGG double neck crack... I always feel so freakin brand new & ready for a new week. 🥳

I can’t say enough good things about her. She RADIATES such a positive & loving energy. Super gentle, attentive & takes her time. (Cuzzzzz I’ve been to a handful of other chiropractor offices and I just never felt like they truly cared and I was just another “number” to them).

But seriously, HURRY & go make an appointment with Dr Jj - you will NOT regret it!</Review>< pics>

My family and I have been seeing Dr. JJ for about 6 Years,  my son is extremely comfortable with her, she is always playful and gentle. I am probably one of the hardest people to adjust because I am so tense and she’s the only one that doesn’t have a hard time adjusting me, I always recommend her to people looking for a family chiropractor!<//review>

It's really hard to find a chiropractor for the first time, you don't know what to expect or if you are in good hands. A good friend recommended Dr. Jarrah for my family. I was having lower back issues after my pregnancy that I thought would be there the rest of my like and my newborn was having severe issues with reflux. After one visit for my daughter, her reflux resolved and she started eating better. We are so grateful! We were on the 4th different medicine for her and it wasn't doing anything. I took about 3 visits to get rid of the lower back pain I had. Now I go every 6 months or so and my back pain hasn't returned. I still take my daughter (we have need with Dr. Jarrah 3 years now) and she enjoys the visits. I don't know how chiropractic treatment works, but I am very grateful to have found Dr. Jarrah, she is an amazing person and her bedside manner is so warm and understanding. Thank you!<//Text>

Dr. Jarrah became my chiropractor when I was pregnant with my second child! I had a lot of lower back pain and extremely tight sacrum, which affected my work and my sleep. she was able to release my tightness and also taught me some exercises that would help strengthen my back that I could do at home! Thanks to her she was able to release the tightness and I was able to get the sleep I needed even in the most of comfortable 9th month.  She helped me so much and I birth some big babies (son 11+lbs and daughter 10+!!!)

She also treats my very active son (he was 2 when we started seeing her!) and like any active little boy who runs, jumps and falls! She always adjusted him so he is good to go! She truly listens to what he says even if it just from his imagination, She was totally awesome the whole time!

She has been treating my daughter since birth. She has helped with her ‘asymmetrical crying faces’ (basically a dropping lip) something that my doctor said would never go away or get better but now you can hardly tell!

She is and will always my prenatal, post pardum and regular chiro! We love her!! My son is always asking when "when can we go see Doc JJ?”<//review>

I do not appreciate being taken advantage of by their valet “service” avoid shopping here if possible so you’re not looked at like an idiot and forced to turn over your wallet</Review>

<text>Visited Comoncy. Food was good, but the help was not.
** Make sure NOT to leave a tip until you leave! (And do so only if you feel a tip is warranted). **
I ordered a triple cappuccino,  but got a regular latte. I told tge waiter, and he said he'd exchange it. Then, he turned around and  started cleaning a table, taking back dirty dishes, etc. When he came back, he started wiping off the dirty table (there were 3 other clean tables, so it's not like that was the only table available! ) I asked if I should take my coffee back to the register, but he said he'd take care of it. Then, continued wiping off that table, the one next to it, arranging the tables and chairs, etc. before finally takung my coffee to be exchanged.  I still onky git a single, not triple shot, but I decided to count my blessings that I got something close to what I ordered.
Then came my order. It looked great, and rasted just as good. However,  the waiter knocked down my knife to the floor when he brought my order. He picjed it up and told mw he'd bring me another one. He dusappeared and didn't see hum until he went to talk to 2 girls who had just sat down. I couldn't get his attention,  I never got my knife,  and not once did he never come by to ask if everything was ok or if we needed anything.
The worst part of this is, when you pay at the register (at the time of your order, of course), you're asked to add your tip amount to your order, BEFORE you have any idea what the service will be like. Also, even though we got some takeout items, and they were labeled as such, they still computed tip on the entire total.
Again, don't tip until the end (and only if you feel a tip is deserved), and make sure it's for the "eat-in" portion only.</text><rating>2<//rating><pictures>None<//pictures><UserId.>114973403120696822282< /UserId.><Resp>None< /Resp>< Time>

Edi was so helpful.  The most dedicated mechanic I've been to.  My truck has had a power steering problem for months & he finally figured it out, refusing to let me drive it until it was 100%.  Really appreciate his help & hard work.  Will definitely return.</review>

As I faced a puddle of antifreeze in my driveway, I chose this shop because of the reviews although I thought to myself, it might be too good to be true. Luckily I found that Star Auto definitely lives up to the 5 star rating! This shop has figured out how to merge excellent customer service with skilled expertise and I am absolutely impressed. I know the amount of work it takes even to get a decent diagnosis in my compact/Tetris engine, and this shop was able to provide one quickly. They gave me the information I needed to make an informed decision regarding necessary and recommended repairs and services. Best of all, the prices are very reasonable. They were very honest, quick, and it was nice to be reunited with a repaired and washed car. If that wasn't pleasant enough, turns out they also took care of my pesky rear light that had gone out, no mention, no charge. They followed up a few days later to see if everything was alright. I am 110% satisfied, and I will definitely return and refer my friends.</Text>

<review>I went in because I thought my brakes needed replacing and they looked at them and told me that they were still good. I appreciated the honesty. Through easily could’ve just replaced them and charged me for it even when it was unnecessary. They found some other issues with the car and fixed them at a reasonable price. They also got me an Uber to and from my place! Would definitely recommend< /review>< username>

Star Auto Does a fantastic job making sure your car is not only repaired but they check all other areas and systems in the car to make sure they are also working properly. They take care of my problem and take care of problems that were brewing. They are always professional and friendly and you know your car is being well taken care of. It’s so nice to always have the option of using their rental car so that you’re not out of a car while yours is being repaired. I have been going to star auto service for over 20 years and will continue to do so.< /Text>

<text>The service is excellent! And this shop tells you everything you need to know about your car. They will tell you the cost of service before you agree to the service which helps me feel more prepared financially. And they send you a link to click on that will give you the entire run-down of your car’s health. Which is SO helpful. Thank you Star Auto! You are my go-to mechanic!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1568325701773, 'text': 'Sarah thank you first of all for choosing Star Auto Service for your auto repair needs!

I highly recommend this auto repair business for all your service needs.    They truly care.  They also help you understand what’s critical to be done now, as well as those operations which can wait.   This is essential when you’re trying to budget.   It’s great having Rob and his staff in Brea taking care of our community!</text>

The staff at Star Auto Service is absolutely amazing.  My car was at the shop for many issues and while the car was in repair they provided me with a loaner car.  I am also please for their fair and honest prices.  My car is running smoothly and I am so happy with the service provided.  If I could give them 10 stars I would.  Thank you Rob and staff!</Review>

<review>I got stranded out of state with a dead battery. We found these guys through our BNI network, and they were so helpful! Our battery is a weird kind, but they sent out for it and got us back on the road really quickly. It was a great experience, and I recommend them to everyone!<//review>< Pictures>

Rob was great.  He was extremely detailed and kept me updated on everything that was going on. He had my car four 4 days and gave me a loaner with no charge!  I’ve been looking for a honest mechanic who can work on my 2013 VW Turbo Bug and I have finally found one.  I will definitely be returning for regular maintenance.<//Review>

< Review>
Had a pre-purchase inspection done on a BMW Z4.  I'm a thousand miles away and they gave me peace of mind purchasing without seeing.  Did a great job on inspecting the vehicle and pointing out any issues.  Wish you were near me, I would use you for all my mechanical needs.   Thanks!<//Review>

I found Star Auto Service as it's walking distance to my office. I called first to make sure they are able to service my car. I spoke with Rob. He was very knowledgeable and provided me the necessary information. When I brought my car in, there was a few issues that I needed to deal with for my car. Rob was able to answer all my questions and did not appear to try to make a sale with me as I have experienced at other auto service places. He fixed what I needed to address first. I will bring my car back when needed.<//Text>

They tell you all of the things that are working and not working, then they tell what really needs to be done. They don’t try to sell you on unnecessary work. They will also tell you how to do it yourself. Great guys that I have come to trust over many years of service.</text>

I experienced a high level of professionalism, service, and quality of work, starting with even the call to set up an appointment. After two visits, one for an inspection before a lease buyout, and another to perform standard car maintenance, I can easily, and with confidence, recommend Star Auto Service to my family and friends.

Tip: Just start with making that call to set up an appointment, or even just to ask questions, and find out for yourself the difference in quality. Prices are quoted upfront and honored. Services are meticulously recorded and very transparent to customers. Office is modern, clean, and in a quiet location with plenty of parking.<//review><date>1559426836496<//date><Name>Diana Chung<//Name>< user_id>

First time visiting this place. I had a driver's side window that wouldn't roll down so of course I needed to get it fixed before I get pulled over by a cop and they end up shooting me because I refused to roll down my window. I called up a few places, all which sounded shady until I finally called Star Auto Service.

The lady receptionist passed me over to Rob, and Rob was very helpful. He told me to bring in my car to the shop and that his team would help diagnose the problem and let me know once they know what the issue is before charging me for any repairs. After dropping the car off, Rob actually offered to call an Uber/Lyft to take me back to my work so I wouldn't have to walk. That's great service right there! A few hours later he called and confirmed that the rotor and motor were damaged and needed to be replaced. Luckily he was able to do it all in one day so I was able to get my car back by closing time and it was working great.

Unfortunately, the next day the window suddenly failed and again, I reached out to Rob and had him take a look, after his diagnostic, he confirmed that the electrical harness was damaged and explained to me in great detail how it can happen and how to insure that it doesn't happen again, he would use a longer harness.

I got my car back and now everything has been working fine. Normally mechanics are known be shady and give off that vibe, but not with Rob and his team at Star Auto Service. I'm very impressed with the customer service and quality of work. I saw some people complain about the prices but honestly, it's not much different than other shops around the area, at least for me and I'm willing to pay a few extra bucks to get the great service I got here.</review>

I went to Star Auto for maintenance service and  was impressed with the courtesy of their staffs. They are knowledgeable and have enough patience to explain everything to me. By the way, their price is very reasonable in comparison to others. I will recommend Star Auto any day to my friends and family members.< /review>

Star Auto Service did a great job diagnosing and rearing my car. Everything was clear and concise from the get-go, they send you a digital inspection of your vehicle with photos rating your vehicles "health" with photos so you can see everything that they have inspected, and what needs addressing or repaired.< /Review>

<Review>I needed to get an oil change done on my wife's car and I had heard great things about this shop and it was local to me so I thought I would give it a try.  I had a fantastic experience, I dropped the car off in the morning and they did a full inspection and texted me their findings.  Rob went over everything with me and let me know what he suggested I do and was not pushy at all.   They wound up only doing an oil change as I was pressed for time that day, but I will be back for sure for my car from now on.  If you want a great shop that does awesome work and has a nice staff then you need to go to them.

<review>Trust the reviews!! I’m not sure why it took me so long to find these guys, but their service is second to none. In this day and age, you simply don’t find this kind of service and workmanship anymore. Rob gave me a loaner car so I could get to work (for free!!).

They have an online assessment program that allows you to review their inspection of your car, with pictures and comments, before you decide what you want to do. Nobody likes paying money to service their car, but if you have to spend it...spend it here. They definitely earned my business from here on out.</review>< pics>

Review is for a total of 4 vehicles.  3 mine, 1 family member.
I do not wish to sound like a commercial, but I have to say every time I have used Star Auto Service, I come back with nothing but smiles.  Been using Star for about 2 years now and only but once did I ever have an issue with work performed.  That one single time I brought the issue to Star Auto's attention, they took my vehicle back, no hassle what-so-ever, made good upon their work (turns out it wasn't even on them, it was someone else's work that went bad in an interconnected system), they did not charge me anything at all.  Star Auto totally stood behind their work.  All my several other occasions I've used Star Auto, I got SUPERIOR QUALITY work done for a responsible and reasonable price.  I would highly recommend Star Auto to anyone.  Their KSA's along with their work ethic is the BEST.  I used to go to Firestone, never again - Star Auto is the only place for me and in the last 2 years I've never regretted it.  Totally satisfied and confident the job was done right.< /review>

My first visit in here. After a local Land Rover specialty shop is closed, I have been looking for a good one and I think I found one. One of technutians used to work at a Land Rover dealer shop even - nice surprise!
All staff members are friendly and their communication was excellent. Their diagnostic report found a couple of items under warranty. I highly recommend this store. I already let my friend and niece know.<//Review>

<Review>You can tell these guys want to earn your trust.  I had routine maintenance performed and part of that service was a total vehicle inspection. They found additional issues I want aware of and they didn't just expect me to take their word for it - they provided photos clearly showing the issue found along with an explanation why it should be fixed. It was accessible via a link sent by text (good use of technology by making it convenient for the customer).  I really appreciate that because that shows me they want your trust and do honest work for an honest price. They even explained that some issues were not urgent and could wait; I mention that because some shops will try to make you worried, saying it should be fixed urgently, just so they can make a buck -  not this place. I'd trust these guys to babysit my kids.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1566268853481, 'text': "Wes that was an amazing review.....and hilarious we don't normally babysit but for you anything!

They answer calls quickly, offered me an Uber ride home after I dropped off my car, and had a full breakdown of everything that needed to be done. Usually when places call you and have a list of things your car needs done, you have no idea if it needs it or not. They sent photos proving why certain things needed to be fixed or eventually looked at, and were in no way pushy to get them done. I will be taking all my vehicles here from now on!</Text>< pictures>

Went in to get air conditioner fixed. Everything works great. Quick, clean and as promised.  Even a car wash to boot! Would recommend that you check them out next time you need your automobile worked on.<//Review>

If you are looking for great work done by professionals that are knowledgeable then this is the place to take your vehicle. I recently had to replace my manifold. It seriously has been a problem since I bought the car. I have taken my car to the dealership (because that is what we think we should do right?) Well, I had had enough back and forth. I finally contacted Star Auto Service and relieved I did. Patrick explained everything to me, helping me to really understand what the problem was. Was fair in my estimate and got me back on the road safely and timely. I am very happy with the work that was done and will return in a about a month to have some further maintenance completed. Thank you guys for a job well done.</review>

<text>Talk about needing help in a pinch:
I had to get my mom's car fixed, while moving both parents from a Condo to a Skilled Nursing Facility. It hadn't been driven in 2+ years. Reviews of this place convinced me to call. Had to have the car towed, as the rear brakes were shot. This is a family owned & run local "Hero-Place"!
The owner said the rear brake-drums were totally shot; nearly affecting the axle. They took the car, even though it was just before New Year's Eve. It was ready  on 1/02/18. Now for the kicker: When is the last time the "Labor" part of the Bill was only about 28% of the total? Jeff (Owner) actually apologized for the cost of the parts!
He & his lovely wife took the time to chat about elderly parents, & situations that occur in dealing with them & their property, etc. I would let this guy remove my Tonsils, if necessary (LOL)! Nicer people you won't find. Honest, above reproach, extremely capable Mechanic. I give Star Auto Service my highest recommendation, followed by a round of applause. Thanks again Jeff! 🚙🚗🚘👍👍😄<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1519607316190, 'text': 'We get the great pleasure of working for so many great people just like you Patti.

<Text>My car will only be serviced here moving forward. I’m a very busy person so it was amazing that they provided a loner car so I can go on with my day while my car was getting repaired. What was so cool is that they texted me pictures with what was wrong with my car and did a full analysis and let me know what was green which meant it was okay and the red showed what was wrong. The price was soo reasonable! I was shocked and sooo happy! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!! Thank you so much Patrick and Star Auto Service for the amazing car experience!! =)< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Great local family-owned shop that goes out of their way to make sure everything is right. The owner, Jeff, is retiring soon, but his best guy, Rob, is doing a great job taking over. They helped me deal with some insurance BS, too, and really genuinely care about you and your vehicle.</review>

I went to 3 other places that said they could change out the headlights but they couldn’t get the left side open for some reason. I’ve been driving at night time with my high beams on and needed it fixed ASAP.  I went on YELP, typed “headlight repair” and the 1st place I called was “Star Auto Service” in Brea.  I spoke to a guy there who said we could do it just might take about an hour.  I got there and was literally driving away with working headlights in 20 minutes.

I came by late in the afternoon with no appointment, I found this place online and chose their establishment based on the online reviews. I was blown away with the service. Not only did they not turn me away even though I did not make an appointment, they drove me to my house while my car was serviced since it was going to take more than a few hours to get to it. They sent an Uber to pick me up when it was finished. I have never been shown such hospitality at an auto shop, they truly set the new standard of customer service. On top of that, my vehicle was maintenanced efficiently and at a good price. They did not try to push additional services on me, but simply gave me a heads up about some upcoming things that I would for sure need to take care of in the near future. Wonderful staff, wonderful business, they are doing it right.<//Text>

I have used these guys now on 2 different cars and every time they have diagnosed and handled my specific problems quickly and for way less than the other quotes I was getting. I'll start with my 2006 Lexus IS250 which had 3 dash lights on: check engine, VSC light, and traction control light. I was told by a different mechanic that it was going to need a new catalytic converter for $2000+. I brought the car in, had these guys diagnose it and they came back with a hose that had come unplugged due to a bad motor mount. So they put on a longer hose and fixed the motor mount, all for under $400.

The other car was a check engine light on a Honda Civic that ended up just being the gas cap and I got out of there spending less than $20. Their honesty and integrity is very apparent the moment you walk into this shop. They come highly recommended and I will never go anywhere else for my services! Thanks Rob & Patrick. Shout out to the past owners too, they were great also. Wish you well on the retirement.< /Text>

I’ve been coming here for years.  Most honest mechanics around.   Their safety checks have saved me some serious issues down the road.  I’ve been very impressed with the recent service changes.... a texted link to a review of your vheicle (with pictures), text updates, and a free car wash when it’s done.  Reasonable prices to boot!  I wouldn’t go anywhere else.<//review>

< review>
If anybody wants to instal an amp,or speakers I so recommend to everyone to go to WEST COST CAR AUDIO. They are very professional, well organized and they explained every little detail perfect, they guy who helped me his name is Nemo. They treat your car like if it’s one of their own, they made me feel comfortable to the point I would trust them with the people I care about. Price are really reasonable specially with the awesome work they do they take their time to fix and install everything. Also I didn’t think they would be able to install my amp, and speaker that same day but they DID !! P.S. this review is for the people who come to their website and write bad reviews on how expensive it is, if you want a well job done but don’t have the money to AFFORD it then don’t come in . Otherwise keep your negative comments somewhere else. Everyone I recommend for you to come to WeSt CoSt CaR AuDiO . A++++++++<//review>

These guys were very professional. They did a great job and answered all of my concerns about installation.  They finished the job in a timely manner and I would strongly recommend using them over any other!< /Review>

I just had my Kicker speakers and amp ran to my stock radio in my Lexus. They did a professional job.Had everything tucked away nice and neat.This system absolutely bumps. Sounds great I just need to upgrade my stock speakers in my car. Thank you Mike and the crew who hooked me up. I would definitely go to West Coast Car Audio again.</text>

<Review>Needed a Clifford security system installed for a 1999 f250. Had Mike hook me up. Made a great deal and had the job done quick! Big thanks to him and John who installed the alarm system. John did an outstanding job installing the security system and explained to me how the alarm works.< /Review>< Rate>

<Text>Hooked up with Big Mike today.
Came all the way down from Cameron Park and it was worth the drive. He walked me through the whole process for setting up my wife's ride with some serious bumps. His crew did a great job. Very professional team. I'm gonna bring my truck down next!!< /Text>< Pictures>

These are the only guys I go to when I need anything done involving audio. Since day one, getting my subwoofers installed 1.5 years ago, these guys have always treated my right, given me little deals here and there. Very affordable speakers and head units. If you need something done quick, easy, and affordable, West Coast Car Audio is the place to go.< /Text>

Took my car there to have for speakers installed and an amp and he wanted to charged me over a $1000.  Told him to go fly kite your crazy. Took my car to Rolling sounds on Madison Ave. and paid  $482.00.  My advice is never to take your car there you gonna get overcharged.<//text>

<Time>1563232056522< /Time><Rating>2< /Rating><text>I have mixed feelings about my visit so I'll write an honest review. I brought my old car here before for tint and there was bubbles so I knew not to go here for tint again and thought they couldn't possibly mess up a subwoofer. The guys who installed my amp and sub did a great job, especially considering I showed up with a car full of junk on a Friday afternoon. It sounds okay too, after some adjustments. The thing is, I specifically asked for 1000 watts. Half way home after picking up, I knew something was wrong. I had a 500 watt amp and two 250 watt subs instead of the 1000 watts that I repeatedly asked for, but they were closed. The next day the salesman I dealt with insisted that a 500 watt amp and two subs that can handle that 500 watts IS a "1000 watt system". I was shocked because I've installed systems in all my cars and dealt with music equipment for as long as I can remember and this is not a thing. A guitar speaker cabinet and head unit, for example, would be advertised as 200 watts because it is 200 watts of power, not a 100 watt head and four 25 watt speakers. I get that the speakers can handle that divided power, but nobody adds the watts the amp outputs with the watts the speakers can handle and calls it whatever the outcome of that equation happens to be. I called around to other audio shops and nobody does that. The dude played me. If I knew I would be getting half the power I would have done it myself for so much cheaper. He told me it would be 300$ more to upgrade to the system I want and that my old 1000 watt amp was weaker. The ease and straight face with which he told me that I have a "1000 watt system" with a 500 watt amp makes me think this is what he does regularly. I encourage everyone who brought their vehicle here to check exactly what was installed, as some others may not be as electronically inclined and susceptible to being taken advantage of. I also encourage future customers to be thoroughly verbal with the salesman in order to prevent this. Although, I thought I was thorough, considering I specifically asked for 1000 watts many times. Just beware and be aware.< /text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I had all the speakers including the subwoofer and the stereo replaced in my SUV. They did a great job and it was cheaper than some of the other places I priced. They also repaired an alarm system on an older vehicle I had.< /text>

I am driving from California to Michigan for college and for my birthday as well I asked my dad to help get a car alarm and key fob.

They said they could do it for 170 but we said no so they said 140 and we said ok. After I got my car back it worked at first but then after I left the key fob would not work properly. I called and spoke to Mike who said that has never happened before. I asked if I could bring it back but they said they were too busy and i could bring it the next day. I had to leave to Michigan the next day at 8am (before they open) in order to make my orientation on time. It started to work again so I thought I wouldn’t have to bring it. As I’m driving to Michigan it works maybe 1 out of 10 times. I don’t know what to do. We can’t get our money back and I’m already in a different state. I want to go to a place that can just do it right or know what they’re doing. I’m already barely scraping by to go to college and don’t know how I’m ever going to get it fixed. I have a Toyota Corolla 2015. I don’t know how hard it is to program these cars but I want to find a place that knows how. Waste of $140 that my dad paid for, but was my birthday and going away to college present.< /text>

<review>Had some unique needs. After explaining everything to Nemo. He seemed to completely understand my needs and actually had some better ideas. after discussing price on entire install I decided to move forward. Got me in the following week, although the job had a lot to do and it took a total of two complete days to accomplish. Workmanship is excellent.

Great work and great prices! Went in needing to get an alarm installed, and was able to get same day installation at a great price. Really clean work, I checked once I got home and all of the wires were neat and organized. Would recommend to anybody and will go back if I ever need to.<//Review>

<time>1542758439159< /time><rate>5</rate><review>This store really took care of me. I am not very knowledgable about what makes some speakers better than others, and when it comes to amplifiers and subwoofers it can get confusing.

Mike and Isiah really took the time to help me find what works best for my vehicle, and I walked out with some great equipment. They assisted me in finding the best fit for my budget through comparing brand prices, sound quality differences, and what will fit best for my needs. They were even nice enough to give me a discount on top of the great service! I will definitely be back....

And I did come back again three days later to get a sub and amp. I had lots of questions, again, but having already built a rapport I was fully confident in the choices we made.

West Coast Car Audio is a great place to get the hook up on whatever it is you need... and Charlie did a clean job installing everything.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I bought and had an alarm installed at West Coast Audio a month and a half ago. The alarm remotes battery has died 2 time in a span on 45 days. I replaced the battery last night and this morning the battery was still good but it wouldn't unlock my car. I manually unlocked my car but my car won't start due to the alarm not disarming. Luckily I was around the corner from my work so I walked there.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Was told over the phone to bring in my audio equipment got on the freeway for 20 minutes to arrive at a price of almost $900 for a install, I guess since I didn't buy the equipment from them they got to find a way to tax somehow and it's a simple install that I minus well do myself thanks for nothing< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
I stop by here to check out due to the nice reviews and rating.  They are 4.2 stars for a reason with how nice the gentleman was. I was helped by a guy named Nemo on a stereo deck. He brought out 3 different lines they carry and explained the difference between the products. That blew me away with the level of service he did to make me feel comfortable in purchasing a stereo deck here. He wasn’t pushy and was really down to earth. It made me feel very welcome in buying a product here. I highly recommend this place to anyone that is in the market for stereo stuff. They are very informative and friendly with a huge line of stuff to choose from.
Thank you once again Nemo and I will definitely recommend my friends here.< /Review>

No idea what happened but I went in to get my amp and sub re-wired, my deck worked before going in and then half way through the install they tell me my deck doesn't work.. how? Either way he tells me that the only thing I can do is buy a new deck so it cost me another $70 that I wasn’t planning on spending.. idk how it just stops working  as soon as they go to re-wire it.. but whatever<//Review>

<review>I have been going to lots of car audio shops in town and this place was the most highly sophisticated  and offers many price range of products plus they're an authorized dealer from brands they sale at their store and you get treated with respect and high customer service. I went to this store on 02/14/16 and Mike helped me, I will definitely be back and recommending this place to everyone.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>Very pleased with the service. We took 2 vehicles in. One for a new stereo and rewrie. Another for a new deck and alarm. It was 430 pm and he was willing to do both right away. It was so hot outside and we did not want to be stuck in the heat, so we left one vehicle and would bring the other back. He said they could still do both before they closed at 7. We left to go get some food. He tried to call me several times about my car but my phone was on silent. We returned shortly after. I could tell he might have been a little irritated, but I understand because they were just trying to finish and needed my approval to do so. We were going to go get the guys Gatorades because it was like 107 out, but one of their guys went and got some before we did. They finished both cars in under 2 hours. Before we went to West coast we went to another place down the street. The guy there was rude and treated me like I was dumb, would not take any vehicle that day and would not make an appointment. It's like he literally did not want my business. The guys at West coast were completely different. They were nice, more knowledgeable and had better prices. Chose West coast they were awesome! Thank you guys for helping us. I haven't had a radio in my car for 8 years! And we are now we are going to take a long road trip to Montana.</Text>< name>

Started off with great customer service this was my go to shop....then I felt disrespected by the owner Rick who seemed to get upset at the fact I didn't want to buy his product because I found a better deal elsewhere. The shop is always so cluttered and if you need something basic fixed you can expect to pay at least $50-$200 for them to tell you that they don't know what's wrong with your equipment. Staff was okay....not as professional as most shops. I would honestly recommend going to a different shop.< /text>

Pretty much what you'd expect. They do reasonable work at reasonable prices. I also like that they don't have an attitude like some places. What sux tho, is they don't really have chairs, so if ur waiting, u can chill by the door , there is alike a step or something I waited on. But I was satisfied with the work, 3 stereo installs so far, no issues, except for one time, they told me that in order to put in this deck they might break the dash, because it was an old car,so the plastic was really brittle. Which was fine I just wanted music. Overall great, just get some chairs lol<//Text>

< Review>
I called to get an estimate on installing my 2 speakers and amp and was quoted $85. I came in this morning at 11:20am to get my speakers installed and was told it would cost me $170, a very large price jump from what i was quoted but decided to let him finish the job. He told me it would be a 2 hour wait. They have no waiting area in the shop so we were stuck outside waiting in the heat. Came back to check on the progress a little over 2 hours later and was told he just started 20 mins ago (non chalantly) and said it will be another hour to an hour and a half. These people arent that professional and arent very considerate. Its now going on hour #3 and still not ready. Worrried how well the work will be. Wont be coming back here again.<//Review>

<user>109873708083114098401< /user><Date>1529353382731< /Date><Text>Brought my father to his favorite Mexican restaurant in the Crowslanding neighborhood.

The food was awesome with freshly made tortillas. Customer service was superb.

The restaurant had beautiful pictures that really stood out. Will definitely be visiting again in the future.<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< GmapID>

Shaded outdoor seating area, nicely enclosed and screened in. Well kept, very clean facility. When ordering at the window, I couldn't help but notice that the food preperation area is kept immaculate! Menu is straightforward easy to understand and order.</text>

Terrible place, some food ain't that good, horrible service, very expensive, and they don't clean there tables. This place used to be good, but I don't know what happen. Will not recommend, but you make your own decision.<//Review>

ABSOLUTELY HORRIBE! My food was served half cold, the waitresses were acting like prostitutes and not like waitresses. I seen things I definitely did not want to see. Also, when I asked for a beer she didn't bother to even bring a lime and when I did ask for a lime, she brought me a whole cup and slammed it on the table. I do not recommend it.<//Text>

It was ok. I ask order to go. Shrimp soup (caldo de camarón). They add like 3-4 big shrimp with the head, eyes and skin 🤢 i don't like those....and like 3 small shrimp. (No head or skin) as I liked them. That doesn't says in the menu... from vegetable they add some potato, carrots and celery I was expecting some Italian or Mexican squash but nope... they charge almost 19 dls. So I don't think that was worth that price. While  I was waiting some live music with was so loud that you can't really talk almost you have to scream talking which was not the comfortable and that was just the time waiting for my food because I asked to go. I feel sorry for those eating there. Or maybe they just like it. But not me. That was on Sunday.</text>

The Burrito Sinaloa is the best Burrito I've ever had, would give 5 stars, but they always have music playing at 8 million decibels and 2 times out of 5 my order was brought out wrong because of it. Great seafood guys, just turn off the goddam mariachi music.<//review>

<text>I used to come here alot when I was a little girl. My favorite dish was la jaiba rellena especially when they served the bread and to go in and see that it wasn't full and that you had a mexican vibe was so satisfying for me. I could eat peacefully with my family while the banda played and the tv was turned on to univision. I remember going with my abuelitos this one time they came to visit from mexico.<//text><userid>111254396960021765767<//userid>< time>

The food is not fresh and too expensive, however, if you like norteña music, they have live Mexican bands on the weekends very vert loud.</Text>

< Review>
Service is  terrible,me and my GF got up to go to our car (waitress was informed) when we got back to our table our drinks and our food were gone,we told the waitress that our drinks were gone she apologized and said she would talk to her boss about it well she did and her boss said there was nothing he could do so we asked for the check and as we went to pay the waitress had the nerve to say that our food was half gone so it didnt matter if we didnt finish it,then if they threw our "half gone" food and our drinks they should charge us half right?? Well its ridicoulous,enough said!< /Review>

<name>Damien Morrow< /name><review>We like a lot hanging out. Last night we arrived in this magnificent place which we didn’t know before. We spent a lovely time there with superb food and a well-trained crew and a great cook. We  added this restaurant in our phone list  and we will no doubt go again very soon.  Highly recommended.< /review>< pictures>

<text>I came here in a Sunday afternoon and there was a long line. There was one poor girl behind the counter helping everyone. But she was attentive and patient, and offered plenty of free samples. They also offer KCRW discount.
The ice cream is delightful. They have some unique flavors. Will be back!</text>< Pictures>

Great frozen yogurt. Don’t really have much to write about. Helped my self setting up my yogurt cup. Had to deal with a cashier only once when I paid. She was nice. It was delicious and nice and creamy and a lot of Oreos and a lot of stars in my eyes.<//Review>

Got the rose water sorbet with rice noodles and lavender ice cream and sampled a cucumber ice cream. All of these flavors were exotic and tasty. The staff was very nice but was kinda slow. Waited for 15+ minuets even though there were just 3 groups ahead of me.< /Text>

<text>One of the best Safran pistachio ice creams I've had! It was so creamy and rich. Totally recommend it. The parking is great too, you can pull in the public parking right there.</text>< Pictures>

Always a delight and a nice time for the step daughter to have some one on one time with her step father.  It’s nice being able to try all the new flavors.

I think they need to add salted caramel as a permanent fixture in the location.  However I do find it appealing being forced to try new things.

It’s a rather small location where most of the tend to be nice and polite with a positive community feel.

I think the only downside is that it’s at the end of the shopping center.  The parking and traffic coming in and out of the center can be a hassle.

Wasn’t the first time I was here.  Won’t be the last.</Text>

Their ice cream and cakes are quite sweet so you'll need some coffee to balance out your taste buds.

Turns out it was a steal at roughly $5 per cup for amazing quality and selection, plus free waffles and stickers for the kiddo. I got some myself, and wow!! Their rock solid chocolate shell was amazing! The staff were alright and the store was clean.<//text><gmapID>0x80c2bfd49f6c33a1:0x6e0b6e44264fc831< /gmapID><Pics>None<//Pics>< Date>

No Sugar added Yogurt is always pretty good today they had Angel 👼 Food Cake 🎂! Yum. Only problem was this blonde kid outside who kept leaning into the large plate glass window, and bumping it with his bubble butt. I kept thinking the whole thing was gonna break and I'd be eating yogurt & glass shards!<//text>

Well, I don't care for Menchies yogurt, but they do have dole whip now, so I do go and get it. So close to home. It doesn't taste as good as disneyland's, but it's also 45 miles closer and maybe that's just me thinking everything tastes better in disneyland.<//review>

I was so excited to have had the pleasure to get the chance to work with Miguel Chaparro in getting myself a car I was more then excited about! They made buying a car much less intimidating that I had imagined it to be. &not to mention they gave me a great deal and even sent me to a shop of they're recommendation to get the right side Headlight fixed since it is going to be night time soon and he noticed it was out. . I couldn't have asked for a better car buying experience! Thanks again USAVE!</Review>

Came to show my coworkers the cars and I ended up buying my first car the next day! I love this dealership, they are very trustworthy and helpful! If you need a car then please go and look for Chaparro, he’s one of the best. I’m so so very happy with my new car and how the workers here treat their customers.<//text>

Sooo rude!!!!!!!! They have no respect for you. Guy spoke to me like I was child being very disrespectful raising his voice at me. I’d never do business with them. We’re humans it makes no sense to speak to people the way he did. They make you write all these nice reviews until they get you in the door and they dehumanize you which gives you no other choice to be defensive with them.<//review>

Jonatan its just a sweetheart, we drove a long road with fear that he was just one more salesman out there lying just to make you come to the Dealership. He did substained his word and make it happen, with patience and effort he went the extra mile to help us out get a vehicle in You Save!  Tks Jonatan for helping us out! You are the best. 👍👍👍< /Text>

However I was able to purchase a vehicle with them on July 21st, 2020. Nice running for a college student like myself. Miguel Chaparro made getting a car possible for me. I cannot thank you enough.

<user>117450213015196690534<//user><Review>Looking for an affordable used car, I walked into this dealership with an open mind. We were led to the back by a kind gentlemen, who I believed was the manager to view cheaper alternatives. My family and I were deciding between two cars, but I was more drawn to the Grand Jeep Cherokee than the Dodge. In terms of make and model, I wasn’t sure what I had wanted, but once I saw the Jeep, I knew it was the perfect fit for my lifestyle! During that time, we were introduced to an associate named Jonathan who was friendly and helped us through the process of choosing by giving honest suggestions. In the end, I committed to the Jeep. The legal procedure went by smoothly and in a timely manner which I thought was professional. Because my parents don’t speak English well, Jonathon does an excellent job to make sure they understand by speaking slowly and giving me time to translate. Overall, I was very pleased with my car as well as the service. A highly recommended place to those looking for a decent vehicle, fair price, and great business!< /Review><date>1578699632581< /date></record></dataset><record>

I went to this dealership on 7-16 I was very surprised at how fast I was in and out. Miguiel and his crew definitely showed me that there are good people out there in the world, I highly recommend this place to people who need a vehicle and want to get in and get out with out being scared or pressured. ‹< /Review>

Amazing place. In & out and ask for Miguel Chaparro. Amazing service and very professional. I bought my first car off the lot same day!! Everybody is attentive and amazing car RATES. Will be buying again here and excited for my new ride. A LEXUS IS 250. Miguel C. Helped me tremendously and I could have done this without his HELP.<//Review>

Engine is shot. Warped head from overheating, shop says cooling system almost solid from stop-leak being added over and over and over. This was a long-standing pre-existing condition that was purposely hidden from us. We still have 9 months of payments on a car we cannot afford to fix. We have now heard reports of other people buying cars here and the cars overheating and being ruined.
STAY AWAY, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>If you have bad credit and have no where else to turn and really need a vehicle these guys can help you get into a car today. I had got turned down from numerous dealerships because of the marks on my credit. Not only were they willing to work with me on the over all price of the car they helped me on the down payment. Very pleased with the service from Jesse and Jonathan.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I really recommend auto auction for a new ride if all of the dealer you been deny’s you with credit and repo. They’re the real deal. Go to them first before you stop somewhere else. Ask for Jonathan. Very friendly, easy approval. Thank You Emanuel.</review><UserId.>104922780893769007042< /UserId.>< gmapID>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>My niece bought a 2009 Nissan Sentra on August 30, 2019.  You see her husband passed away 2 months ago and she had her mother move in to help care for her 18 month old.  My niece bought this car for her mother so that she could help with doctors appointments, grocery shopping etc....Her mother drove it to Hemet on Sept 2 and when getting off the freeway the car started shaking-  come to find out the 2 front tires were shot and needed to be replaced at a cost of $145.00.  Prior to that the starter needed to be replaced and U Save Auto Auction picked up the tab on that.  Thank  you!  I drove the car on or about Sept 4 and instantly new that the transmission was slipping so I took it to my mechanic who verified just that-  the transmission he said would maybe last 6mo to a year if she babied it.  The cost to replace it would not be worth it in his opinion.  I have known this man for 25 years and he has always been honest so I trust what he says to be true.  The price for this LEMON $9,994.00.  My niece is not in a good place emotionally or financially.  She called and spoke to Jose Rios the general manager and he was extremely rude.  Not only did he lie about having to contact Corporate (does not exist). The salesmen Miguel told my niece that when the finance company calls to say the car is for her not her mother.  Miguel also told my niece to lie about how long she has been employed.  Her friend was with her and can attest to this.  I intend on seeking legal action against U SAVE AUTO AUCTION but ask Jose one last time to do the right thing and give her back her $2,000.00 and take back the car. Please.</text>< pics>

<Review>We walked in onto the lot with one goal in mind and that was to walk out with a vehicle that we fell in love with... with the help of Jonathan Sanchez, he made what was impossible for us become possible! He worked with us with every road block we hit with his perseverance we prevailed!!! Thank you Jonathan and U Save Auto Auction for believing us when no body else would!!!< /Review>< rate>

I change my rating and review because not even 2 months after purchasing a car from them, the car is out of commission until I can come up with the money to fix the engine and I’m still paying monthly payments on it. Do not come here unless you have plenty of money to throw out the window<//review>

USAVE AUTO is THE PLACE to go if your looking to get into a car. Excellent customer service the staff is amazing and very professional!! You are greeted right away when you come into the gates by one of the salesmen and help you right away.  Miguel Chapparro  is your guy and will help you get the car you love.</review>

<Review>Usave Auto Auction is the best place to buy used cars.  We have purchased multiple trucks for our business from Usave and plan to purchase more! The buying process is stress free and the staff is very nice and helpful. Thank you Jesse for all the easy and quick vehicle purchases.  👍🏻< /Review>< time>

High priced vehicles and strange set up. Many of the cars needed tires and external work just from first glance and are still dealership pricing. Went elsewhere quickly.< /Review>

Felt major pressure to purchase. Was brought there from another car lot, after being told they had the Jeep I wanted AND it was cheaper. Both were untrue. I spoke with Jesse and explained I was told about the Jeep, ect. and he -- true to used-car-sales-man form -- diverted me to other makes and models.</Text>

Very bad place. Never go there.
They sell junk cars for very high prices.
They have no Auction policy and they never tell the true car condition.
Simply they scam people.</Review>

This place is a Joke, you don’t save. Look around, you can find similar or exact cars for much less elsewhere. Mileage isn’t displayed, cars need to be jumpstarted. They do the very minimal to the cars to get up and running to simply break down and cost you even more money on a car that is already overpriced to begin with.< /text>

<text>They advertised an auction on Wed. but when we got there there was no auction. Typical bait and switch. They told us to just look at the low priced cars. I asked why they dont display the mileage on them.  They told us 'we'll figure it later".   I will never go there again.<//text></record></dataset><record>

BEWARE!!! DONT BUY HERE!! THEY SELL LEMONS! RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL!! Bought a vehicle here 2 days ago and it broke down already! Sounds like the front right wheel is going to fall off. I'm a single mom of 6 and made it very clear I needed a reliable vehicle for my children and THEY SOLD ME A LEMON!!! I called and spoke with the manager, Jose Rios, to find a resolution, being that it's been less than 48 hours since I left the lot, he told me he could refer me to a repair shop but the financial responsibility is mine!! Like I would trust ANYONE they would refer me to at this point! Told me all he could do was go over my contract with me and show me where they're not responsible. Just called and asked for the managers name and was told "why don't you ask him yourself!" BE WARNED PEOPLE, IF YOU WANT A RELIABLE VEHICLE, DONT BUY HERE! I'm contacting an attorney and I'll be having the vehicle towed to their lot and dropped off.

UPDATE, AFTER TAKING THE CAR TO AAA CERTIFIED MECHANIC, IT NEEDS WHEEL HUB AND BEARING REPLACEMENT, COMPLETE COOLANT SYSTEM REPLACEMENT AND HAS A LEAKING HEAD GASKET!! GRAND TOTAL OF $2,000. 2 DAYS OUT OFF THE LOT..... U SAVE AUTO AUCTION ARE SCAMMERS WHO SELL LEMONS, DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!</review>

A rip off. The vin numbers dont match and most cars needed to be jump started. 90 percent of the cars dont have air conditioning.  The workers there are a joke and want to sell you lemons. I definitely dont recommend this place unless you want a car thats going to need alot!! Of work. You have been WARNED!!!!</Review>

<text>I wouldn't recommend it to nobody first of all they sold me a car that doesn't work I gave 1000 dollars down at the time I bought the car n besides that I'm still going to be paying 280 a month for 9 months plus I paid another 1750 for transmission n is been a month already n I haven't received my plates.In total That's almost going to be e6000 Dollars for the car I was hoping to waist 3000 but at the end that's how much is costing me I'm really disappoint to be going trew this how could people rip off people how do they have the  heart I'm a single mom n is hard I just posting this so people know what kind of place is this n the most part that disappoint me is the guy that was helping me he told me that there was nothing wrong with the car😞😞 which it was a big lie n besides that yesterday la Banda SE rompio so that's another 75 to fix add it to the 1750 n total is going to be 1825plus whatever I'm paying for the car is really sad I hope nothing else stops working because I don't have no more money I'm just praying to God nothing else goes wrong<//text>< user>

<Review>Horrible service! I bought the car in august of 2020. I was in a inpatient program from October until January. In November they repossessed my car. They never notified me that it was repoed despite the numerous calls to them and legally they’re supposed to send several written notices with a timeline of how long I have to pay to get the car back which I never received a single one. I thought the car was stolen so I reported it and they acted like they didn’t know anything when I informed them instead of letting me know. I thought something was fishy because I know they have a tracker on the car and they didn’t care work with the police to find the car. The car is still in my name and I’m still getting tickets in MY NAME. Over $800 worth of toll road tickets. They lied to the police when we showed up to find the car saying they didn’t know where it was and when we got to the back of the lot we found my car. I will be suing this company! Very unprofessional, very rude and I’m not the first person filing a lawsuit against them<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>(Translated by Google) Me and my spouse bought an Avalanche two months ago and it came out very good. We are very happy with the purchase and the young man who attended us was very kind. The vendor who did not help was called Jonatan and he let us handle it before buying it. Our credit was not very good and they helped us to get it.
Thank you.

Yo y mi espodo compramos una Avalanche hace dos meses y nos a salido muy vuena. Estamos muy contentos con la compra y el joven que nos atendio fue muy amable.  El vendedor que nso ayudo se llamaba Jonatan y nos dejo manejarla antes de comprarla. Nuestro credito no estaba muy bien y nos aydaron para agararla.
