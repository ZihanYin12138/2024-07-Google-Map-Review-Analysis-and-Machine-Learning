After being ditched in the cold at 10:00 at night with my son in the middle of the city by American cab. I called yellow cab and they sent someone immediately. Excellent service thank you so much for everything. My son and I are not from San Francisco and had gotten turned around and could not find where we had parked the car. Luckily I had taken a picture right as we had gotten out of the car and the cab driver was able to locate it within 10 minutes. Living Angels!!!< /review>

The cars can be a bit older and the calling to get a ride is unreliable.

<text>Family had medical emergency last night, they took the bus but it was the last bus for the night and now they were stuck on the final bus stop in the cold. Family couldn't speak English well and I was at a different city at that time. I google and found the yellow cap number, explained the situation. Yellow cap showed up fast and on time, took my family to the hospital, and family got his medical treatment. I called again for the cap to take them home. Really save my day. I hope the drivers and the person who answered my phone call yesterday saw this. I just want to say thank you.<//text>< Pictures>

I called for a cab 2 different time's last night yet neither showed up, I saw cab's drive right past without even slowing down, than the driver removed me from their system and even the last driver texted me saying "Thank You For Using Yellow Cab" so I texted back asking why my cab never picked me up, I asked twice and received no response so I called just to find out it was a cellphone and the driver didn't answer. I later made my way down Market Street to Van Ness and called Flywheel and they arrived in very little time. This is the second time I've had trouble with Yellow Cab, I'll try everyway possible in the future to avoid using them.<//text>

<text>I left my wallet behind in the car as I was dropped off at the airport. I tried waving down the taxi driver before he drove off, but he was already gone. Panic ensued. I began calling the taxi line.  Multiple dispatch people did not want to help, and I was told to call x number,  call y number, oh go online and fill this form, disregarding I had a flight to catch. They said they would send the gentleman back out to me at no-charge, that he had my wallet, and that he was just finishing up another ride. This took about an hour and a half, and five phone calls.

The gentleman arrived, whom which I did enjoy great conversation which on my ride up there. I think the service to the airport was not a problem, and obviously me leaving my wallet in the car is not his fault. I offered him $20 as a thank you for bringing back my wallet, he explained that I would need to pay for a full car ride. As I did not know where he was coming from, I felt this was unfair, especially after being told it was a good samaritan act, and tipping him 20% on the cab fare earlier.  He demanded $40 from me, stating he was at dinner with family, which I believe to be a lie as dispatch said he was on another drive, and it only had been about an hour and a half in the middle of rush hour. I offered him $30, and he became irate. With me needing to run to my flight, I took the high road, gave him the $40, and went on with my day.

I believe this experience could be improved on these issues:

1. Drivers should check if the customer may have left something behind prior to departure, or if they're waving at them to at least stop, the above scenario could be avoided. This is a nice touch that could really save someone, and really up the customer service game.

2. Being told the driver would come meet me out of good will, is one thing. If it is goodwill, please communicate that to the driver, or at least communicate what the fee is ahead of time, as I have no idea or any way to actually validate where the driver came from, or have the ticker running to show the length of the drive. This will avoid a person in distress to feel like they're being taken advantage of.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Since I called for a ride with a insured driver and not a ego boost, I got great service. I have never waited for a cab from them in 3 decades, often they are early. Cab drivers are always great..never had any problems. Thanks, glad real taxies service still exists be in SF.<//Review>

Rude driver, inhuman price, worst service so far. The driver became very impatient after I told him the place I wanted to go(it's an easy-to-find apartment building in Redwood City), he said "I don't know this place, give me an address number." He has a cellphone in front that he uses to navigate and I told him the place can be easily found in google map. To my surprise, he then turned angry at me and refused to open the map!  Finally I persuaded him to open the map with his divine cellphone. The place showed up nicely in the map(of no doubt!) and he became silent. The trip from sfo to redwood city(about 15miles or 18min) cost me $73 in total... Now I fully understand other reviews about the robberies and I will never use the taxi service, too.< /Text>

<time>1555882843046</time><Text>Waited outside for 20 minutes. The driver called but I didn’t pick up because I was standing outside with 3 large boxes waiting and figured they would see me.

Called back after a minute because I didn’t see a car pull up and the dispatcher confirmed the driver had cancelled because I didn’t pick up the call.

I was outside. Waiting on the curb. Dispatcher explained the drivers are “busy”. this is so disrespectful. I know they’re busy. I called for service. I’m the reason you are busy.

You wasted MY time and didn’t offer an apology.

I went out of my way to support local taxi instead of using Uber. Ended up using uber anyways because they told me it would be another 20.

I’m writing this review so hopefully someone there will take the time to teach employees about some average customer service at least. Cancelling a call while I wait on the curb is unacceptable. If the driver was at the correct address he would’ve seen me.</Text>< gmap_id>

Awful.  I called Yellow Cab to request a cab to take me to the San Francisco airport.  The dispatcher asked for my name and address, and then asked if I need the cab now or was reserving it for later.  I told him I needed it now and asked how long it would take.  He responded "15 minutes."  Ten minutes later I was standing on the street corner waiting.  Half an hour goes by.  Nothing.  I called Yellow Cab to request an update on my cab.  My previous dealings with their phone system have taught me that if you have a pending ride, the automated system will say so in order to avoid multiple calls.  However, when I called the automated system did no such thing and instead I was transferred to a dispatcher.  The dispatcher was not only extremely rude but utterly unhelpful.  First I asked for a status update about my cab and the dispatcher was unwilling to give me an update.  Finally after bickering back and forth for several minutes, the dispatcher finally said "let me see if the driver is still on his way."  Excuse me?  I ordered the cab, no cab picked me up, so why would the driver not be on his way?  After being on hold for several minutes I was displeased to learn that the driver had "bailed" (the dispatcher's word, not mine).  Meaning, the driver had decided to cancel my ride without warning.  When I asked the dispatcher why the driver would not have the decency to inform the call center the dispatcher responded by saying that the calls were controlled via a computer system and that the cab driver did not have to call to inform the call center that he was cancelling my ride.  This would be fine except for the fact that no one at the call center attempted to send a new cab, or contact me to see if I still needed a ride (which, guess what, I did).  When I pointed that out to the dispatcher, the response was "we don't do call outs."  I politely requested another cab, told the dispatcher to rush it, and that I would not be canceling the ride.  My cab showed up a few minutes later and I talked to the driver about it, who stated that the dispatch system did indeed get notice of a cancelled fare but that the dispatchers had a habit of doing nothing.  While the drivers for Yellow Cab seem friendly enough the actual "Customer Service" people and all of the dispatchers are disgustingly lazy and incompetent.  Don't waste your time or money.</text>

The skinny, raggity-haired Asian man freaked out over $1.80. My friend had just gotten arrested for who knows what, it was raining, dark, and I had backpacks and a dog, and I am not from the area. I didn’t know where to go as my phone had died. I asked someone to call the taxi. It ended up being $6.80 (and he kept the meter running once we got to the destination). When I couldn’t find the rest of the money he screamed at me, took my stuff out the trunk and threw it on the wet ground on the street corner. Very disrespectful- possibly HIGH on some drug...I would never recommend or use yellow cab of San Francisco.

This guy said he was the owner of this sf yellow cab branch</text>

Took the cab P1039 today at 6:30 PM at the Airport. Dora the driver stopped the taxi meter at the airport and ask me 68 USD after a 5 miles ride to South San Francisco.
This driver is a scammer and this company is not serious.< /Review>

<review>Worst customer and overall service. Called for a cab, the worker that answered kept trying to confirm the wrong street, but she got it eventually. I got a call from their service confirming it twice, saying a cab will be there in one minute. I waited for 10 minutes and called again and they "couldn't find" my reservation and the customer service rep tried telling me I perhaps called someone else. He tried to tell me a cab would be there in another 10 minutes, when I said I needed it faster, he hung up the phone.</review></record>

Racist.  I've been taking taxis since middle school when seen necessary.  As I've grown into a young man I've noticed how much harder it is for me to request a cab.  Yellow cab when I call never picks me up.   And  I tip more than  40%percent.  I can't do it anymore.  Don't waste your time< /text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>I am so enjoying how yellow cab and its drivers are in trouble financially because of uber and Lyft.

All those years of driving the wrong way to get extra fair or letting people off at the wrong place or just plain being rude or not even showing up is starting to catch up with them. I have absolutely no sympathy for them.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808f7fae20113569:0x73fd4c0b083fc7be< /Gmap_id></record>

A trip from SF to San Jose cost over $200.  I accidentally left my phone in the cab.  I tried repeatedly to contact their lost and found department via phone and by submitting tickets.  Nobody ever answered or responded in any way.  They're only open Monday - Friday so if you lose something Friday you're screwed until at least Monday.< /Review>

< Review>
We called a taxi to pick us up at Transbay Terminal and waited for 30min. After that we called again, our previous call was not recorded. We ordered again and waited for additional 20min. Still no taxi in sight. So we decided to walk to our hotel. Our first activity in our hotel was to install the Uber App. I resisted Uber until now to support the local economy. But if the local taxi company does not serve me, I have no choice any more.</Review>

<review>Absolutely HORRIBLE.

I flew in to SFO and hopped in to a cab operated by Yellow Cab Coop SF. As soon as I got in, the driver told me there was a $2.00 additional fare because of an airport tax. I agreed to it and he began the meter at $3.50 and I assumed the $2 was included in that. After arriving at my destination, and after I paid with my card and tipped the driver more than he deserved, he asked me to pay him the $2 airport tax separately in cash. I said I didn't have cash and assumed it was added on to the fare already, but he actually got mad at me and began shouting at me (yes, he actually shouted) for making him pay the airport tax, now saying it was $4 and he had originally been nice to me by only charging me $2!! When I told him that I had tipped a lot anyways and he could just take it out of that, he got even more mad! I just have never been treated so rudely, and that too by a taxi driver whose services I paid for and who I already tipped!

I am still completely shocked, I feel like the additional 2 dollar tax was a scam, and I wish I could remember or had written down the driver's name so I could make some sort of report. He was an older, overweight white man with a grey beard and those glasses that have a second sunglass lens attached to them. If anyone has his name, please let me know so I can make some sort of official complaint with the company. Although judging by the other reviews on here, it seems that would not even do any good since their customer service seems to be horrible all around.

I have never written a review for anything else before this, but I just felt so mistreated by this company and that driver that I felt it warranted a review...< /review></record>

<text>Several times I have had yellow cab drivers in San Francisco drive so aggressively that they’ve almost caused major accidents—involving my car and others. Today on Ocean Ave. a yellow cab cut me off, and when I honked he slammed on his breaks and flipped me off. I will NEVER give my money to these cab drivers.<//text>< Pics>

I use cabs a lot because sometimes it's just more convenient then taking a car. I needed someone picked up in Daly City, and depending on the agent you get, some will send a cab there and some will not. Many of the operators are rude on the phone and hang up on you over the phone. I'm going to be finding a new cab company or simply driving myself, but most of the time parking in San Francisco is no fun. I think this company gets most of their clients because their phone number is so easy to remember, otherwise the abysmal customer service would sink their business. I have been a loyal, frequent, cash paying customer and don't deserve to be hung up on. I was going to rate at 1 star because of this experience, but I am rating at 2 stars because they do arrive fairly quickly, and get you to where you are going quickly also.< /Text>

Another horrible taxi story. I called about 4 pm to Yellow Cab and asked to have one come to my house at 5 pm. One hour's notice should be good, right? And I needed to get my cat to a 5:30 vet appointment on Valencia (10 minute drive at most) so I allowed a little extra time. When they weren't there at 5:10, I called and they said they didn't have one in the area yet. I was told "Making an appointment doesn't assure you of having a cab there at that time." I said, "That is a great company slogan"</Review>

<review>Had to take a cab on Thursday 8th, 2018 to Napa at Maritage Resort and spa. Plain highway robbery. The metter said $160 and he insisted it was $260!! Then he demanded cash only. I said I had planned to pay with Visa debut and he insisted cash was better leaving me with no cash and he had the audacity to ask for a tip, quite demanding. Then he said he didn't have cash and kept the change of a $20. Keeping almost $16 dollar tip on my change. I wasn't going to give him anithing after paying more than the cost my flight to San Francisco round trip. I was robbed, plain and simple. The shuttle was gone, couldn't connect with uber and my last resort to get to my appointment in Napa was airport taxi. Ruined my trip completely right off the bat, I was robbed! Gave me no receipt either.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>Bad experience with this company.

I was desperate for a cab because my friend needed to get to the airport, so I called this company. Worst mistake. I gave the rep my name, provided an address, told her the number of people (4). She said it would take 5-15 minutes for the cab to arrive. The 1st cab came at 20 minutes at the wrong address, did not call me, and picked up a stranger off the street when he knew he was picking up a party of 4. When I called asking for an update, customer service was not sympathetic or apologetic. I scheduled another cab, and this cab cancelled on me without providing me any notification. I had to call in to ask, and the company took no responsibility. The last cab came in 22 minutes and at that point, my friend was going to be late for her flight.

Again, worst experience ever. I spent 1.5 hours waiting.< /text>< user>

I travelled to San Francisco as a tourist and I believe my camera was stolen by one of the cab drivers of this company. I was travelling with my family and unfortunately I left my camera in the taxi (forgot about it because I was worried about the stroller and other stuff). I realized immediately what happened and called not longer than 5 minutes after we left the cab to Yellow Cab San Francisco Co op. I left my camera in the cab number 2703, on February 3rd at 10 am, we travelled from the Haights to Russian Hill.

The answer that I received from this company was shocking. They told me that they didn't have the contact number of all their drivers, but that they would send a message to the driver and called me back. I called several times during that day, each time a different agent answered, always in a rude mood, and kept telling me that they didn't have more options other than send messages to the driver. I think the messages were sent by the same system that sends the information to the cabs about which passengers to pick up. So, I wonder if the driver of taxi 2703 didn't look at his screen during the whole day until his shift finished or didn't want to call back?

I kept calling for one week and spoke with different agents and lost and found several times but my camera never appeared.  I also sent an email to Yellow Cab but they have not replied.

In my opinion this company is totally unreliable, they don't have the contact number of their drivers, and I don't know which kind of drivers do they hire. They were also very rude and useless each time I called asking for any news about my lost camera and didn't answer my emails.

I keep thinking that is very suspicious that the driver didn't answer the multiple messages sent to him, and I don't understand how the company wasn't able to contact him regardless having all the details. Was the driver an illegitimate one who was just covering some shifts? Is this cab driver still working there?< /Text>

<text>Worst experience. Rude drivers. Dirty Cabs. Often feel seasick by the time I reach my destination as they all seem to think they're rally car drivers.

The app itself is pointless. You can order a cab & wait 'x' amount of time, only for your cab to be stolen by any passer by as the drivers don't bother with any sort of verification.

All the drivers moan about Uber & the like stealing their business; the cretins in control of this service need to take note.</text><username>David McGlennon<//username>< time>

Yellow Cab drivers are the best in the City because they know the streets than the other commercial drivers e.g Lyft ,uber drivers. Cab drivers in city don't need GPS to take you to your destination. Take a cab. Call a cab. All their cab that i rode in are clean and smells good and the drivers are polite<//Text>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I would give this zero stars if it were possible. My family took one large cab that fitted 5 of us and our luggage from sf airport to our accomodation. The driver spat out the window numerous times on the way back which was foul and sped up to 25km over speed limits only to suddenly break when he saw something coming. He additionally ran a red light. Despite all this he got us to our location and we wanted to stick with something we knew on the way back to the airport so against our better judgement booked a taxi which we explicitly stated needed to seat 5 passengers and 6 'large' pieces of luggage. When the taxi arrived it only seated 4 passengers and the driver couldn't communicate well enough to understand we needed another one. He suggested 'we all try squeeze in without a seatbelt' which we were not happy about after the terrible driving of our prior journey. It was getting to rush hour and we were going to miss our flight so had to call up the company and order another cab, both of which we payed full price for when the service was beyond poor and it was entirely the companies fault ordering an incorrect vehicle and failing to rectify this.<//review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>I really do hate giving one star.

No seriously -- just ask anyone who knows my movie tastes, I give the benefit of the doubt to every director and can pretty much find something positive in any cinematic offering.

But damn, leave me and my kids stranded to almost miss our flight and it's ONE STAR for you YCC!

I have used the Cooperative a few times in the past and, while often late, they never just failed showed up. This past weekend, I made an ONLINE reservation a full four hours ahead of time to be picked up in the Glen Park/Sunnyside area.

8:30 arrived. No cab. No call.

I called them up to make sure. They assured me that they would have someone on the way.

15 minutes later. No cab. No call.

I called again explaining that we had a flight in less than two hours. Buzzzzzzz. And we got cut off. Surely he did not hang up on me . . . surely.

10 minutes later. No cab.

"Ring ring" -- A call . . . an automated call saying that they would not be picking us up. Are you kidding me?

So, I called again to plead our case and SHOCKER . . . another hang up.

WOW.

Fortunately, we had an alternative way to get to the airport and we budgeted enough time to get through airport security, but if we had not had that we would have missed our flight and there would have been some very sad children to deal deal with.

All this it say, we will NOT be using Yellow Cab Cooperative ever again - In the words of Taylor Swift "exhausting" -  as our ride to SFO. It really is a shame as I want to support them, but if their reliability is nil AND customer service is going to treat me poorly, it's off to BART, UBER or Super Shuttle we go.< /Review><name>Bruce Reyes-Chow< /name><Rating>1</Rating><user_id>116068780296930090249<//user_id>< Date>

<Text>I booked a cab a day before for the SFO airport. Taxi didn't arrive and when I called yellow cab, the person on the other side of the line was very rude and actually hanged up the phone. I had to call them 3 times before getting a Taxi.
Very bad experience especially for tourists who are not fully speaking native american language and accent.<//Text>< pics>

I've lived in the city for like 10 years now and I take taxies, Ubers and some times Lyfts from home to work and back routinely. However from my experience in the city, by transport wise, it gets crazier and crazier every year, and to be able to move with in the city from point to point is a night mare. Anyway, I see lots of you guys giving this bad rating about cab drivers like if there is any other driver that can do better than them! Uber? Lyft? Side car? even limos?, but they all are dependent to the so called GPS and I still use them by the way, but they all suck at it, guess what so is every body who is driving in the city at the same time and using GPS same as you, and you're stack with them as well, and then it gets really stressful very quickly. There is no one that knows the city better than a cab driver especially during traffic. For God's sake these cab drivers at least went to driving classes, and studied city maps, interesting points and traffic timing, tell me is there any other professionally trained driver other than a bus driver? Even though I have had some displeasing situations with some cabbies, but most of the time I'm home or work before any one who is using Uber or Lyft at the moment. Hey they always know ten times better than any Uber or Lyft drivers unless those drivers were cab drivers previously. I get that it needs a fixing with the customer service and all their system but please don't trash the cab drivers, while you come to our city once in a year and act like if you know it. To those who use cabbies from SFO, I really feel bad for you and my heart bleeds for you. One last thing, according to the city law, in any city the taxis are only allowed to operate with in their city limits or they'll charge you 150% out of their city limit fairs. To San Francisco taxis thou, at least they take you 15 miles away from the city whole while SF is only 7 miles by 7 miles. So if you take Uber or Lyft because you want to pay less, its just you being cheap don't blame it to the taxi please.< /text>

I took taxi from SFO airport to dublin,and taxi did not have meter. And he did not use his GPS , he has used phone for navigation. And he charged me 165 dollars, based on the chart he had. And inspite of reaching the destination he missed to take right turn and then charged extra for that.Later he gave the printed bill of 120 dollars which did not have taxi number. And I forgot my phone in that taxi, but could not trace it till now.Now there is no way I can trace that as meter or GPS was not used in taxi.uber charged me only 55 dollars for this trip , which is far less than these guys charged.<//Review>

I took this cab (19898G1, 1281) at SFO, Dec 30th 2014 around 12 O' clock.
The driver (was vietnamese I guess) said hi to me and helped me to load my luggages. He tried to get good tip.
However, he could not understand English at all!!! I told him my address as soon as I got in the taxi because he started to driving without ask me anything. After we got out from sfo (about 5-6mins), he asked me my address. I already told him several times slowly, but he couldn't understand at all.  I asked him to go back to sfo but he still didn't understand. Then he gave me his navigation to type my address.
Finally we got to destination, and he said "two dollars because airport". Okay. Then I gave him cash to get change, but then he said "how much? how much tip? How much tip do you want?". WHAT? Is he forcing me to give him tip? I told him "just give me the change". However he kept saying "you tell me tip. how much tip?" I didn't say anything and he showed me 'whatever' face and throw my luggage. OMG. It was terrible.<//Review>

Called the company about 20 times. They kept saying oh thats terrible let us call you back. Nothing!  Police report is in the works. Taking Lyft for the rest of forever!< /Review>

<Review>This was about the only cab company that would come out to the Portola District when I lived there a few years ago.I'd probably give them a 2nd star because most of the drivers were OK but then I had to ship a bunch of stuff from the UPS Store by CCSF on Ocean and I could NOT get them to PICK ME UP. I WAITED FOR 4 HOURS IN THE DARK AND A GUY THAT WORKED AT THE STORE ENDED UP GIVING ME A RIDE HOME. I called them EVERY 20 MINUTES AND NOTHING!!! So DON'T BOTHER if you're around that area and they won't pick you up from anyplace they deem "sketchy" SUCH AS the Safeway near Mission and Geneva. BECAUSE THEY ASSUME YOU'RE GOING TO THE PROJECTS IN VISITACION VALLY OR HUNTER'S POINT - ERG WHAT A#$H0L3Z!!!!!!!!</Review>< user_id>

Everyone's expectations for the politeness of cab drivers and dispatchers surprises me. I'm from New York, and these guys are nothing, in terms of crazy, compared to what I'm used to. I've called Yellow Cab several times, and they showed up within 5 minutes. They even give you a 1 min warning call. The dispatcher was clearly a 20-something guy who's not there for his dream career and it shows (who cares?), and out of all the taxi drivers we had, only one was strange, in that we had to tell him how to get there and he yelled at some people after he almost ran them over while he was running a red light and trying to pass a bus. All we did is sit in the back and gave him a near-to-nothing tip. The bus is always an okay option in SF...I have never met such nice bus drivers (except for one jerk, but you could tell he hated everything). A lot of options, because SF blocks are long and steep.</Text>

<Text>I would really not suggest this cab company...they mainly answer to people that are hailing a cab.  If you call, you will rarley get a cab.  Also when you call a cab, the order is automatically sent to all the computers that are inside each cab.  so its "OPTIONAL" for them to acutally respond to a call.  I wouldnt reccomend it if you are going to order one via phone.< /Text>< user_name>

Maybe because I slow down in a curve, which was the right thing to do. Dangerous for the passengers and other drivers.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x808f7fae20113569:0x73fd4c0b083fc7be< /gmapID>< username>

Like everyone else, I have to say this cab company is a piece of poop. I called them, waited 45 minutes called them again and they had dropped my order without even contacting me. Then they said they would have someone out to me right away. I waited another 20 minutes called back and they said he was on his way. Then I waited another 25 minutes and I just canceled my order and called Veterens and I am waiting now...hopefully they will get here soon...</Review>

<Review>Twice I have called this company and their automated system says there is a cab on the way and then about 20 minutes later I get an automated call to say there are no available drivers and that no cab is coming. I would never rely on this company for a time sensitive journey like to an airport or something. Will not use them again.<//Review>< username>

We waited and waited 30 minutes for our taxi and called back 3 times asking where it was - always told 2-3 minutes. Meanwhile we were stranded with two young kids in an area that we never would have waited if we knew the taxi wasn't in fact on its way. Never ever calling this company again.< /Text>

<Text>Operator was extremely rude and nasty, hung up on me once for giving a cross street instead of an address, answered in an incredibly condescending way the next time I called up to give and address. Never use this company< /Text></record>

(Translated by Google) Trash taxis, waiting at 8 o'clock at 8 o'clock in the ferry terminal at 8 o'clock. The phone calls are elsewhere, and the callers are more trashy. I do n’t understand where to wait! 😡🥶😡🥶

I tried this salon on a whim because I need to remove/cover some vibrant colors in my hair (green) for a more professional look. It was a tough job but I left happy. This business is back open after the pandemic. I called to make my appointment. Olga, the owner, had me txt her photos of my hair in its current state and what I wanted. She was able to provide me a price for the service I was asking for. My hair was great. I even picked up high quality products. I plan to go back for all my coloring needs. Give this salon a chance.< /review>

This salon is my go to place for a trim. The owner of the salon (Olga, not sure) cuts my hair beautifully. I tell her to cut a specific amount of inches and she does it perfectly fine!  I’ve had horrible experiences in the past where hair stylists cut a huge chunk of hair..opposite of what I request. Every since, I’ve been coming to her to maintain my hair long and healthy.</Text>

(Written from inside store)

The salon is inviting and clean.  The staff is friendly and welcoming. I got the exact style of haircut I wanted AND at a very reasonable price.  I enjoyed my experience and will recommend this establishment to all my friends.

Hated this salon. The wait was horrible considering there was only one other person there. When she went to cut my hair I should've ran... She didn't know what she was doing. Will never return.<//Review>

The staff was excellent and the facility was great! There is a good size parking lot and I didn't have to wait at all to get in and be seen by someone. You can even make an appointment online if you want. It's so nice to have such a quality option!</Review>

Terrible service. Walk-in to get my blood pressure check. I was advise that they don't do it. I said Wow", what kind of service do you provide? I guess I had to pay to get it check. Drove down to the nearest Doctors on Duty and had it check. For Free too. What can we expect in a self-centered commercial system.<//text>

<review>I have gone to your urgent care two times. I am so relieved you are there when my own clinic wasn't.  Each visit, was awesome. I can't say enough about the staff and providers. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! Keep it up. Blessings and stay safe.<//review>< Pics>

Just a great overall experience  !  MoGo is the place to go when you don’t feel well and want a reasonably quick visit to get answers to get on the road to recovery! Regards-Janice Brown</Review>

<Text>I fractured my foot while hiking up at a nearby park. ER visit would cost me $2000, so I called MOGo and asked if they would see me. They said yes. Staff were super friendly and helpful throughout the entire office visit. They referred me to a Podiatrist who called me for an appointment the following day. Super happy my friend told me about MOGO. It’s my go to urgent care in Monterey.</Text>< userid>

Hands down the nicest urgent care I’ve ever been to. I made an appointment online and did not have to wait at all when I arrived. The staff was so friendly and helpful, they went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. The building itself was clean and sanitary but it had a very warm and welcoming atmosphere, not like a rigid hospital at all.< /Text>

<Text>Kim and Tara were amazing and super knowledgeable about my broken fibula! They were light hearted and made my broken bone feel special. I've already told my all friends about it the amazing customer experience MoGo offered and the up-front flat fee pricing. By far the best experience I've had at an urgent care facility! I had unusual demands that they readily agreed to and supplied me with expert data going forward.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>The staff was very professional, pleasant and minimized the items that normally would be touched.    The NP was an excellent listener in hearing my concerns and quickly overcame my own non-professional diagnosis.   I left with a prescription, feeling fully satisfied with the visit.  Now about 10 days later the issue has cleared up.<//review><UserId.>104396368109251819215</UserId.><pics>None</pics>< response>

Nice location but poor communication. I called to see if I could get a strep test and what the wait time would be, and was told there was no wait time. So, I rushed over just to be told by the receptionist (who I just spoke to) that they DO NOT perform strep tests due to covid. Doesn’t this seem like an important detail to mention?< /text>

< Review>
This is a clean and very friendly swimming facility. I have been taking my son here for three years now, and I have always been pleased with the the program. My son has progressed in his swimming abilities and I am so pleased with his instructor . He really knows the swim techniques and how to push my son to move further in a positive way.<//Review>

My  mom takes us here to take classes. The classes are totally free and they are only on Saturdays and Sundays but are worth the wait. They have public at 1:00 through 3:50 and the tickets to go inside are only 1.00 for children and 4.00 for adults. Great place and I want to be here everyday but I cant. You should really consider this place for family fun and its an indoor pool.<//text>

Large, heated indoor pool with spacious dressing rooms, warm showers, clean bathrooms, and friendly staff.  Ideal for both lap swimmers and rec swimmers.  Diving board.  Bleachers for family to watch child during lessons.  Medium size parking lot with a little street parking.</Text>

<review>Staff needs to be more communicative to the members when closing the pool, changing schedules or servicing the pool.  Don't have us coming up to the pool with our kids ready for their lessons and the pool is closed for maintenance other reasons. You have our phone numbers on file and you know who is scheduled for a class for those days. It is very upsetting to the kids who is excited about their class, only to be disappointed when they get there because no one there bothered to inform us of your closure. While staff is sitting around waiting, pick up the phone and keep us informed so we don't make useless trips for nothing! Other than that love the lessons, and the lifeguards are great...< /review>< userid>

Stop by this aquatic center with my son today 7-15.  The staff here are kids no older than 20 years old and one older man. They look like they are just hanging out eating in the pool area and socializing with each other. The bathroom and locker room and clean.</text>

<text>This pool is clean and well maintained. They also have friendly staff with lifeguards who excel at challenging you to be better at swim. The pool also does keep their water nice and warm just about all of the time. (sometimes the water heater can malfunctions)<//text>< Pics>

The temperature is always right. On hot days or on cold days. I'm not giving 5 stars because the parking can be a bit too tight and sometimes there is none.</review>

<Text>I love the fact that they require swimsuit. I like the pool, the lockers need some work, parking can be a headache..Staff is ok, there is one African American big guy  who i feel, he is rude and abnoxious..He jumps in the pool like its his, splashing at everyone and doesn't care...Other than that is ok..</Text>< Name>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>It is horrible they have bad scheduling and rude staff and they block of like 75% of the pool and you have a little packed area to swim with barely any space and everywhere else is empty and the staff are rude they. Dont let you do anything but swim back and forth you cant walk at all. And on monday wensday and friday the pool dosent open until 7pm and closes at 8:15pm like how dumb is that who wants to have to wait until its cold and darkish to go swimming😒 i really am mad tgat this is the nearest pool to my house and last time the water was freezing it felt like below 20 degress and no one wanted to swim and if you go with friends you cant play in the pool or touch each other😧😤 dont go here its the worst<//Review>< pics>

Such a great choice when taking advantage of their 3 for 10 dollars special. Since my company moved to Simi Valley, I started trying places here since we don't have a fridge in the office yet. I had a reward to use for their 3 for 10 dollars special going so I was able to get my sirloin steak. For my sides I just got double fries and chips/salsa for my appetizers. I was bummed they didn't have the Texas fries as an option. Ordering online and selecting curbside pickup was so easy. When it was my time to go pick up my order, I was the only one there probably cause I put in my order right when they open. This Chili's location is shared with Costco so be prepare for the traffic inside the lot while going in and exiting. When I pulled up to the designated pickup spot, I sent a text that I was there and someone came out within 5 minutes to give me my order. The lady was very friendly and made sure I had all my sauces in the bag. I love their Sirloin Steak, keep in mind when you get your food that's hot .. open the container a little bit so the steam escape and doesn't continue to cook your food. My office is across the street so I didn't have to do that for my food.< /Review>

<Review>The food is amazing! We had the chicken crisper & it was so tendered & delicious! With the 3 or $10.00 deal you get a drink, appetizer & main meal for $10.00! You can't beat that! The staff is very friendly & they do a great job keeping the place clean & sanitized! Definitely recommend.<//Review>< Pics>

I really like this place. They have a good variety of foods that taste great. Do not get delivery though. They ALWAYS mess up your order. My order has been wrong about 80% of the time. I suggest to pick up your order and check that it is correct before leaving.<//Review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>Love the 2 for $25 deal! You can get 2 meals for $25 like for each a side salad, steak dinner with 2 sides, and share a dessert! Lots of food!! Then if you want you can add a yummy Presidente margarita 🍹 for only $5!!! Oh and their tortilla chips are AMAZING with the salsa, but even better with the queso dip. 😋< /Review><userid>101230766034118513253< /userid>< Resp>

The food as usual is awesome and so are the Margaritas, but I wanted to add that the curbside service is also too good. The Chilis app to order to go may not be the best but this restaurant staff makes sure that they get you the right order and on time. Best customer service (to go/ drive thru experience) !</review>

Went with friends to Chili's on lunch on Oct 21/19.  I think they only had 2 waitresses for the whole place and it was lunchtime.   I ordered soup and salad and both of their soups were terrible.  They were gummy and pasty with no meat or veggies in them.  I had the bottom bowl option and waitress charged me an extra $4.95 which she corrected after I let her know.  One of my other friends had the clam chowder and got sick.  I will never go back to chili's.  A can of soup would have been 100% better.<//review>

<Text>Update: This started as a 1-star review but has since updated thanks to Management's intervention, Management listened to and address our complaints, Michael went above and beyond and took full responsibility for his staffs error and took it upon himself to apologise and make it right. I'm leaving my original review up so others are aware of the original issue and just so you know, avoid Nick as your server.

What is up with Chili's and terrible service. The food was delicious, but our service was absolutely the worst. We ordered an appetizer than never came and when we canceled it they claimed they brought it out and we turned it away. I had to order my beer 3 or 4 times before it ever arrived. They spilled piping hot beans on one of the members of our party and didn't even apologize and to top it all off forgot the tortilla's for an order of fajitas. Absolutely the worst service and wait staff is completely incompetent, and this is on a Saturday where you'd expect to have a decent staff available.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Just got home from having a delicious early dinner at Chili's in Simi Valley but was disgusted to walk in and have the female bartender look at us standing at the front entrance for 5 minutes. I know it's not her job to seat us but she could've asked someone to help us so after 5 minutes we grabbed our own menu's and sat in Sheryl's station and she was a joy!!! Not to mention very apologetic about the piss poor performance from the bartender who ignored us. This is why we only eat at Chili's 2 times a year. Hit and miss at your establishment.<//Review>

The staff was very helpful and friendly.  However,  the food requires much improving. The salad I ordered taste of water with flavorless dressing. Although, the shrimp I had added helped with seasoning and taste but only slightly. Overall, I will only return if I find myself in the situation that there are no other options to locating a restaurant in the area.< /Text>

It is as you would expect a Chili's to be.  Decent service.  Tasty, consistent food.  A bit loud.  Nothing spectacular, but good for a quick lunch or dinner.< /Review>

Ordered a ribeye and got a top sirloin. It was large and cooked rare just like I ordered so I ate it anyway. It was good. Service was very good. Computer crashed as we were trying to pay our bill so we had to wait maybe 15 for a reboot. Anyway, the greeter, the seater and especially the waitress were all friendly, professional and attentive, even though we had a party of nine and worked our waitress pretty hard.< /Text>

The chips and salsa used to be reliable, but it's a hit and miss.  The burgers are still good, minus the pickles. If you want a steak, pay a bit more and go to outback. For me, it all started going downhill when they took the chicken fried steak off of the menu. Fortunately, for them, TGI Friday's is worse. At least for now. Could be a race to the bottom.

We love their food and service is pretty good. Always clean and staff is nice.  Although when you go with a large party, it's a given someone's food will be forgotten and or wrong and refill on drinks are SLOW. should probably throw 2 servers on large parties.< /text>

Got the lunch special; great deal in a nice relaxing atmosphere in the bar. However my double cheeseburger was delivered while I was still eating my soup; it would have been nice to have it staggered a little bit better though.</Text>

Amazing food! But ever piece of silverware had old food on it. The tables were sticky n dirty. The waitress just brushedvthe old crumbs with her hand to clean it as she was sitting us. Th were was so many old napkins and trash on the floor. Even a pen. But the food was excellent.< /review>

<Review>Food was really good, unfortunately I can't say the same about the service. Sheryl was my server and she wasn't attentive or friendly and I was not busy .
But it look like she was ready to go home. Sorry  but not a good attitude.< /Review>< user_id>

Went to dinner Saturday nite . Had the 2 for 23. The appetizer and the salads and the main course arrived at the table all at the same time by the time we got to the main course it was cold. My wife's chicken margarita was burnt. There was a table next to us with approximately 8 people drinking margaritas they were so loud that we could not carry on a conversation between our table. Chilis will not see us in their restaurant again.the staff did nothing to quite the noise table.</Text>

This place is outstanding pricey but well worth it you have to not really out do yourself as one order is pretty big so don't go crazy going through the menu unless your 300 pounds or you like wasting food.. The quezo with chorizo and chips are to die for their puffy tacos!!!! AMAZING!! The service is very good too for the price I paid well worth every penny can't go wrong here! This spot is a must go Chili's Grill & Bar.<//Review>

After receiving them ordered our food.  45 minutes later still havent received food or any type of refill.  Just when I was getting ready to leave our waitress brought our cold food out.  Promised to be back with refills 15 minutes later nothing.  At that point ate half my food and called it good.  Paid $52 for cold food no refills almost 1 1/2 hrs later went over to Jack in Box for something to drink.  Should of just went there from the start.< /Review></record>

Saturday night at Chilis.. my first time here was looking forward to a good meal and a cold beer with friends. sat in bar area. service was ok, ordered the shrimp tacos. food came out in a reasonable time but somehow the shrimp arrived cold. I've had many a shrimp taco and never cold. Talked to the manager, Jamie, she was very understanding and took back the shrimp tacos. I did not want a second attempt at tacos so I went with the Char Turkey Burger, which was very good. would have been better with fries which came out after I was half way done with burger.

Overall... I might come back but I hope the service and the attention to detail improves. It was a Saturday and it was semi busy so the service should have been better.< /Text>

<Text>Terrible service and quality food. Food ordered was burnt and plate had empty spots like someone took a fistfull of food off my plate before arriving to me. Most of the other orders were burn or bland. Waitress overwhelmed with only 3 tables. Waitress found out she didn't put in one of our friends order at all when she brought all the food out. One of us went to the restroom and caught her sitting down wasting time instead of attending tables. All of us had underwhelming experience.</Text><Date>1452428591094< /Date>< pics>

Steak came out well done instead of rare, chicken was spongy and broccoli was soggy.
Inattentive service as well. No more.<//review>

<text>I came here craving those new onion rings, but when I got here to order they had no onion rings left. I ordered a burger that was supposed to have onion rings, but they did not have any onion rings for my burger. The service was okay and friendly but they should never run out of food!</text>< pictures>

Was there last Saturday!  Computers were down which meant they were only taking cash "we didnt have cash on us". But the young man that sat us down told us we can pay with debit but would have to write everything down by hand " we did not not mind at all". So my husband and I sit, look at the menu and a waitress comes to us and says, We are only taking cash or we will have to be writing down your card info. And ones again we said it was fine. So finally we have another person "staff" come to us, me thinking they were going to take my order. But instead for the third freaken time!! Well need to take your card info by hand, basically telling us in a kind way....ahh hello get out lol...No cool at all! Never will i go to that Chilli's again! If I was comfortable enough to write down my info they should have attended us. Didnt want no one spitting in my food haha!<//Text>

<text>Customer Service was excellent. The Manager Martin was very nice and went out of his way to give me a good price on my storage. I was very pleased how he made me comfortable just not over the phone but in person. I would let others know if they are looking for storage to go to A-American Self-Storage I was pleased. I believe it depends on the Manager who works there .Thank you Martin<//text><Response>{'time': 1621526279693, 'text': 'Thank you for the wonderful review Donna!

This is a welcoming place for those needing a storage. It’s our first time to get a storage and we felt that our stuff will be safe in this place. Robert is a awesome, nice guy, knowledgeable. He toured us around and gave us the storage we want. Did a very good job for us and granted our request.. Thank you Robert. 🙏🏾♥️😇< /Review>

Service here has to be top tier. Martin went above and beyond to help me out throughout the whole process. Went in looking for storage, left with a huge smile and a sense of accomplishment due to the amazing service that was provided! Will definitely recommend all my fellow colleagues looking for amazing service at an even more amazing price!<//Text>

The storage is clean, with easy access, and friendly staff. The manager is very nice and professional. He goes the extra mile to get the right size unit for the right price. I have dealt with a few name brand storages and they weren't as professional. I appreciate the service I received and I would recommend this storage.< /review>

I’d like to thank Rob and Martin for all their help. My daughter needed a storage unit as she needed to store some of her stuff from her college dorm room. The facility was clean, and convenient. They were very professional and helped us with whatever we needed. Thanks again guys.<//Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Please be very cautious when you store your belongings and valuables here. My families storage was broken into and they have Zero surveillance footage of the incident, they don't even have footage of the day that we brought our belongings in. Apparently the cameras are just for show. You definitely get what you pay for here. Also if you do please have your own personal insurance because their insurance will not respond and the management will also not return calls. A nightmare I wish we could wake up from.</Review><user_id>116616554982649187714<//user_id>< Time>

This was by far the easiest self storage experience I’ve had.  Their level of hospitality was next level. Food, coffee, a tour, and a rate that was so low I actually didn’t think they would stick to it. 10/10 will do again.<//Review>

I don't know how I originally posted a 2 star review on this place. I literally have no idea how that happened. My daughter had to help me figure out how to change it. In no way did I have anything but an exceptional experience. JoAnn is amazing. She goes out of her way to help people, and I absolutely love her. This is the best place to go for storage, HANDS DOWN. Don't go anywhere else!!!!< /Text>

The best customer service I've had in a long time . Martin and the manager was super nice very approachable and very caring ! They have been helpful In everything I needed and currently need . Due to my situation of having to leave my storage so quick without even moving was a concern of mine because i thought they would give me less customer service but instead made me feel at ease with my process thank you for being so professional and quick to answer all my questions and concerns . I will highly recommend going here and getting your belongings stored . I know where I'm going next time I need a place . I will be recommending this place to anyone I know ! Thank you guys for everything I seriously appreciate it!!< /review>

<userid>118428772008611761244</userid><review>I would say love this place but theres no ac or light or plugs so prepare fpr that. Its clean and safe and the communication between tenants and management is on point . Ive been there several years (6 ish and the rent has only been raised twice .. im happy with the rent @ the size i have . I wont share just incase its exclusive however i will say i have a 10X10 for under 140 And its not like "135" and im saying under 140 . Trust me   they have unbelieveable deals in comparison . I have a specific timeframe to enter and exit   DO NOT GET LOCKED INSIDE [been there 😣].<//review><Name>B Queen<//Name></record>

Never go there again, called and ask for rates the sale person told me"first 3 month $230" when I got there he made the contract and charged me $230 a month.  I have  Ask why he charged me $230 a month and over the phone he said 230 for 3 month? he did not denied what he says but says this is our rates . I already drove all the way here unload into storage and came to pickup documents. I will stay for 1 month and will never come again.....I'm sorry to use this word this is my first time and I hope last to say it But they are liers and has very bad business ethics.<//Review>

{'time': 1487792529786, 'text': 'Hi Tal,\n\nWe take every complaint seriously as we do pride ourselves on our outstanding customer service.  We were able to track down the recording of the phone call you made to the office before you rented.  After carefully reviewing the call we have found that the office staff did offer you the special you currently have.  They did not offer you 3 months for $230.  You were offered a discount of $255 per month for the next 6 months, which is a discount from the normal price of $317 per month.  Perhaps you misunderstood or misremember the phone call.  As we stated previously we take the time to investigate every complaint made.  If you have any additional questions you can call our corporate office at (310) 914-4022 and leave a message.  A supervisor will get back to you as soon as possible.  We do apologize for the misunderstanding.\n\nThank you, Management.'}< /Response>

Service ughhh, and they are a lie, they have this big  sign outside (MOVE NOW $19.00) Not even near of that price you end up paying almost $400 for a tiny space.</text>

We do offer a $19.95 move in deal but that does not mean that is the regular monthly rent, it really depends on the size unit but that move in deal is for every size unit.  Please contact the corporate office and ask to speak with a supervisor so we can address any other issues and/or problems you may have had.

We picked up a truck this morning for our move across town and Kayla was so efficient! We love when people are good at their jobs. The new way of reviewing the trucks condition on your phone is streamlined and quick, brought uhaul to the 21st century!! They had the truck ready and waiting for us. Highly recommend working with Kayla. Great work!<//text>

<review>U-haul in is entirety are extremely unprofessional. This was my first time using their storage facility and I was completely unsatisfied with their customer service, from the beginning they had messed up my contracts, and ended up paying more for then I expected then the original contract had stated. They promised a refund and never got it back because no “notes” were left on the system  even though I know they can see how my account was handled from the beginning. They actually wanted me to drive back across the states from where I moved to go and “talk” to the manager because they didn’t handle that transaction there. They also claim that they can’t go and change anything on the contract, if that was true they would not be able to put add ons and to upsell services. It’s a scam how they can’t pro-rate if you leave early on the storage, I will be reporting to the BBB and file claims to have facilities reviewed by OSHA, since I saw a lot of hazards where people can get severely hurt. Overall I would not recommend U-haul storage facilities to anyone and shop around for local storages in the town you will move to, I guarantee you will find cheaper rates.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>James and the gentleman who worked with us behind the counter last weekend 12/19/20 were absolutely amazing.  We realized when we arrived that we didn’t have the proper electrical to connect to the trailer we had rented and literally everything else was booked or unavailable for one way moves.  One gentlemen spent nearly 30 minutes looking for various options.  We only had the one day to get our move done. James came in after another customer failed to show up and kindly called the other customer to make sure she could be effectively rescheduled.  The other client was thankful for the reschedule opportunity and James offered to work our car in and add the electrical it needed to pull the trailer.  He helped us with our hitch as well. He got the job done in less than an hour and saved our moving day!  Outstanding service!  Thank you!!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I have been coming to this location for the past years no problems so far just the last experience was really bad, they moved my appointment multiple times for hitch installation, then I finally made it and the tech was rushing to have do it done but as we know when things are in a rush they do not work out, as soon I drove out of their parking lot a have pop-ups in my car complaining about sensors no working when I finally made it home I saw the rear bumper coming off from the driver's side. So I had to come back the next day... I still have a ton of issues. It was a bad decision to bring it this time. My advice do the hitch installations with your car dealer I know it is triple the price but They know their cars and how to do it.< /Text>< pics>

They did a great job installing my hitch but it took weeks to get my vehicle in to their shop and whenever I called them they automatically put me on hold for 20 to 40 minutes... terrible telephone customer service.<//text>

Had appointment to have electric brake controller installed. Arrived and was told the part had not come in. Person at the counter called someone. Asked it I had been called. Answer -nope!  No explanation just “sorry about that”.  Asked to see the manager - he is in a meeting!  Really poor customer service and by the way, I booked the appointment 2 weeks ago.</Text>

<Review>Justin and his crew did us REAL good!  We needed a hitch, wiring, and a trailer to move things from that location to Texas all in a short time.  When there was not enough time to get the wiring done, he made it happen.  When a trailer wasn't available, his crew there made it happen for us.  This is a genuinely decent group of people that really want to help vulnerable folks through a stressful time.  ALL of the staff there were supportive and determined to make it all happen for us.  THANK YOU for outstanding service and dedication to your customers!<//Review></record>

<review>I had come to Escondido for a family emergency, not knowing anyone there. James Z took care of me by steering me to some free boxes, and was also helpful with giving me the best deal he could for my van. After spending $1300 for a RT ticket, it was a big deal to me as a stranger. Also, bus 305 stops here at the Rock Springs intersection; about 200 feet away. GREAT news for those with limited transportation. THANK YOU JAMES, for your graciousness, in addition to your customer service.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

< review>
While attaching a trailer to my SUV,  an employee allowed the trailer tongue to run up onto my rear bumper valance, scraping and gouging it, as well as scraping the paint causing a small dent in the rear hatch door. As I am elderly, I remained inside my vehicle while the employee attached the trailer.  When we reached our destination and noticed the damage, we called to report the damage. We were referred to UHAUL's insurance company.   When we returned the trailer, we pointed out the damage to the employee and the manager.  The employee denied causing the damage and their insurance company said MY (tow vehicle) was NOT covered by UHAUL's Insurance Policy, only the trailer was insured.  What BS.  Now we have to duke it out in Court!< /review>

< Review>
Worst experience ever. Justin at Escondido U-Haul put on a defective trailer hitch and would not honor the warranty for a hitch that was welded incorrectly from the factory. After experiencing some of the worst customer service I have ever seen and had to contact the corporate office customer service to get a response. I was told by Justin there was nothing they can do. Total blowoff. U-Haul has always been a great company to work with. Luckily I went to U-Haul Mira Mar and they noticed the defect right away and replaced the trailer hitch under warranty. The guys a Mira Mar U-Haul restored my faith and trust in U-Haul. I highly recommend them and will only do business with Mira Mar U-Haul in the future. Justin at Escondido U-haul should take a few lessons on customer service from his co-workers.</Review>

When we rented the truck the people were fine quite friendly and helpful we expected to have the truck only one day however needed it a second day when my wife called about keeping it they first told her that the truck was reserved for the next day which I find ridiculous how many trucks do you have? Then they said that we needed to come in and give them more money because we had made a cash deposit instead of using the credit card she asked if we could please put it on the card and initially they couldn't seem to find their way clear to do that then eventually they did and we were approved to keep the truck until 4:30 p.m. the next day then about 45 minutes later we got a phone call voicemail message saying that we needed to come in and give them more cash that they couldn't put it on the card and that I needed to bring the truck so that they could see I still had it and I said I am not doing that I'm not paying mileage to drive there to see if I still have the truck I have never heard this from these people before I was totally amazed I don't know what's going on there but next time I need a rental truck I'm going to think twice about U-Haul</Text>

I reserved a truck & storage facility & I was extremely unsatisfied & frustrated with the service I received. I called Monday to reserve a truck, I went to pick up the truck at their postal annex location & the location was closed on Sunday! In which I explained to them that Google & the store itself said they were closed Sunday but they made me go there anyways. I get to this main facility & the storage unit was a drive up BUT ONLY a partial drive up! We still needed to use an elevator to get to this unit! They never disclosed this when I made the reservation! We don't move often & if we do I will not be doing business with U Haul.<//Text>

AVOID USING ONLINE HITCH SERVICE
I heard good things about this location form my brother but that is not what I experienced !  when called , they normally very busy and not responding to phone calls or put you on hold for very long , then call transfers to main Uhaul center who has no idea !
DO NOT SCHEDULE HITCH ONLINE -- the online installation schedule and available times are inaccurate and they will charge you first beforehand, then if you want to reschedule or go to a different UHAUL , then you have to chance them for a while to refund !  Want a hitch installed , call and go to a center .< /review>

We arrived to pick up the uhaul and there was one worker who did not know what she was doing. She had to call her son on the phone so he could talk her through what to do only to eventually have sit and wait 15 min for him to come and help her. We were there for over and hour.</text>

<text>Get the vehicle very late than the time of reservation (25 minutes), added insurance  charges to the contract even thought it was denied during the online app.   Worst of is the representative tried to added another two gallons of gases charges even though I showed the gas reciept that I just put them in.
One more thing at the pick up they told me that I have to return the vehicle within 4 hours because they have other customer waiting for it. I said that I thought the truck is for a day.  They mentioned that the online reservation I did was default to 4 hours unless I  changed to a day (why? It should be other way around since the charge was for a day plus mileage’s).  Luckily I only needed it for couple hours.  This place is the worst Rental place I ever experienced in my entire life.
The truck is clean and running fine is the only good thing.  Otherwise I would rated no stars.<//text>< name>

Every time I have visited this location, whether to rent a truck or for propane I have received above average customer service professional and courteous staff. This is the cheapest place in town that I have found to get my propane tank refilled. It is quick and easy.I also appreciate them staying open until 7 pm because I usually discover my tank is empty 1/2 way through cooking dinner. It sure beats going to the drug or grocery store and paying for the  5 gallon "exchange" propane tanks.  You would think Amerigas would give you the best price, but instead they only fill their exchange tanks about 1/2 full and charge you up the ying yang for them!</review>

< Review>
Despite making my reservation over a month in advance, I was told they didn't have the truck I reserved (26ft) when I arrived on the scheduled pick up date. I saw a 26ft truck in the parking lot, but was told it was not operational. After waiting close to an hour, I was told that the clerk was mistaken and that would be the truck I was taking. Similar difficulties were experienced when returning the truck. The only highlight of this location is the extensive selection of moving supplies inside.<//Review>

<Text>Ive been a customer with a storage there for 25 yrs. I have even worked there for a bit.
Every time I go into a bathroom, its so disgusting and filthy! Get your employees to clean the damn place! You all should be ashamed of yourselves.
I would have to clean those bathrooms twice a day.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Horrible experience. We rented a truck for me to bring my belonging from San Diego to Washington state after an over seas tour with my family. I took my own leave to make this trip and left my wife in a new home in a new state pregnant with our 4th, and a 4 yr old, 2 yr old, and 1 yr old. They gave me a truck that was not safe at all to make the trip up the coast. A few hours into my trip I blew a tire; luckily not on a dangerous road or in LA traffic. It took over 6 hours to change not only the blown tire set but the other two because they were so worn down. The mechanic said he was shocked I did not blow both at once that's how low and thin the tread was on the tires. Someone did not do their job and ensure that the truck we paid for was safe and ready for a trip up the coast. They wasted my leave time and a day of travel and not being at work to sit and wait to have the tires changed. Blown tires can happen but this was due to neglect of the store. when we call the store to tell them the situation and our disappointment in their neglect they said tires blow all the time and offered a 50 dollar coupon to use at uhaul for wasting my hard earned leave after a hard move over seas and risking my life. In the military if I was this neglectful I would not only lose my job but could be court martialed for risking another military members life. It's sad how this branch and company value not only their customers but their military customers.<//review>

They butchered my bill so badly in their favor. They charged me for things I never had and charged me double the price for extra miles, and included all the miles in that double charge, not just the extra miles. To top it off the guy in charge told me they couldn't really do anything to help me.

A person that works for uhaul let me know that across the country there are shady locations. "Once a location charged a customer for scuff marks on the side of the tires, I'd never heard of anything like that. Always take pictures of your mileage, gas level, and the outside and inside of the truck, because that's all you have. I only learned about all this stuff after I started working here" they said.<//text>

he absolute worst customer service ever! Rude, disrespectful, and even the manager use profanity with my children nearby! the truck broke down twice and the "mechanic" could not repair the problem...amazing, then they tried to charge me an extra day, because of the delay in moving due to the mechanical failure of their own equipment! Unbelievable! I will NEVER use Uhaul again!< /review>

<Review>Dylan and was AMAZING!  I had problems with the miramar location giving my prepaid truck away (Caroll Rd, btw never use that location).  Jessica who oversees reservations at the call center told me the only option was to rent a smaller truck with a trailer from this location as there were no more 26' trucks left until 7am the next morning (and we were headed out of town). When we arrived we saw a 26' truck in the parking lot but it was reserved for the morning. I kindly asked Dylan if they could transfer the other truck that was offered to me in the morning to this location for their reservation (after explaining my nightmare of an experience) and he agreed even though I knew it was going to be more work for him.  He then informed me his boss Jessica said no. After talking with Jessica again it seems she just misunderstood what we were trying to accomplish. Once she understood she was more than happy to to do this.  This definently helped recovery the entire situation.  They turned this nightmare into a dream!  THANK YOU TO DYLAN AND JESSICA FOR GOING THE EXTRA MILE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN!<//Review>< pictures>

I worked for Uhaul and this location for yrs and I was really upset that the price change was not disclosed. I ordered a 17 foot intown EL and was given a 14 foot intown DC and was charged $29.95 and it was on a week day so .79 a mile. At very most we went 13 miles but were charged for 19. When I called and spoke to the manager he basically told me too bad and I can try to fight it with my bank but I shouldn't get my hope up of getting my money back which I gladly did.  I will never return or recommend this locations EVER... This customer service would never happen if Peter Regan was still there</review>

The manager here and emoloyees are terrible. Ever since the new guy took over from the young man that ran it in October ive been having problems. The manager tried to say i didnt pay my storage and added 15.00 more to my bill. I called him and said i paid the bill on time and he talked to me like i was a little girl who knew nothing .I called
uhaul to complain about what was going on after i talk to the general manager at 950 west mission ave.  The Ceo got involved. That was a couple months ago. Now today may 3rd 2016 they are trying to do the same thing. Again the president is contacted. I wish they would bring back the old general manager this guy is terrible.< /text>

Been going there for years, even when I moved out of the neighborhood. Never taken my car anywhere else. Went for an oil change a few months back, during a time when a lot of people were dying of covid and masks were required. The employee who greeted me came up to my car without a mask and had the whole conversation that way. When I asked him to wear a mask while in my car, he agreed. There was a maskless dude in the waiting area, so I had to stand elsewhere. When I got my car back, the employee had left his used mask on my passenger seat.

I loved this place but they put my life at risk. I can't help but wonder what other stuff they do that isn't so obvious. Never going back. Now I have to find a new spot for the first time since moving here.< /Review>

<Review>I will never take my car to get an oil change anywhere else! The guys here are great, they took care of my car and they weren't pushy like at the other drive up places. The manager Ricky was quick to help when I had any questions and even stayed open late for me once when I called and told them I was on my way but hit some unexpected traffic.< /Review><rating>4<//rating><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Date>

Fast service, though I really don't like when they always suggest a new filter or two, unrelated to the oil. The waiting room is outdoor, so it was a little warm, but they did offer cold water. Haven't decided if we'll repeat our service or not.<//text>

These guys have decent prices, give you a realistic eta, work efficiently, and answer all your questions professionally.

This is my favorite place to get my oil changed and when I need bigger maintenance done on my accord.

I usually time it so I can grab breakfast or lunch at the taco place across the street while they work on my car and it's usually done before I get back.

I highly recommend these guys!< /Text>

Pep boys would not help me because there alarm was malfunctioning and sounding. I found lube masters via Google Chrome right down the street. They took me right away. Very friendly and courteous staff. I just needed an oil change. They explained the cost  and it is right and competitive. I recommend this service center.</Text>

Went in this morning for a routine oil/filter change. Brought my own materials so I was only charged for labor. Employees were very polite and warm. No hard up-sell on extra things I didn't need - just simple, quick service!< /review>

<text>They replaced the oil with the oil filter in less than 15 minutes. I had my own oil and oil filter, so they charged me only for work. In addition, they switched all my tires for an additional $10. The main advantage is that their shop works on weekends. As you know, most local shops are closed on weekends. In general it was a good experience for me.< /text>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>So great and a huge relief to know that there's a place in LA that's fast, fair & friendly for my car. Jose was able to take my car without an appointment, change my oil and filter. He also pointed out things that my dealership didn't take care of. This is the go to place. I wish there were a chain of Lube Masters all over North America. Take your car here, you won't regret it!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80c295dcda44d181:0x19ba77d73fcb2074</gmapID></record>

Ive been looking for the right mechanic in north Hollywood for oil change for my car and general auto repair and I found a place which is lube masters automotive. There's a reason they have great reviews online plus being at that same location for 20+ years.</review>

Hey! I didn't know you guys were on Google just wanted to leave a review and let everyone know about you guys. I took my Infiniti 06 for an oil change and I had a few questions and they answered them all. I was really happy with their service and Jose was very helpful. They will be my #1 shop in my neighborhood in North Hollywood.< /Text>

It was 95 degrees out but have been putting off getting my car in for oil and filter change.. I didn't feel like driving over to van nuys to a place someone recommended so I looked up the best oil changes in a 5 min drive. I found one and they are the best.. I was in and out in less than 15mins and they even did things to car that I didn't know I needed, but the price stayed  low and fair and they called me back at home later to check if the maintenance light was still on and told me to pop back over anytime.. I was over the moon with the service and professionalism.. They rock.<//Text>

Real nice place and people with good prices, plus free wifi while you wait! Since I was there I told them to check a few things on my car and they did.

<review>We made an appointment for 6 people a week early and got there and had to wait 20 plus mins for us to even be seen.  We all got gel pedicures and manicures minus one.  My nails chipped 3 days later so now I have two nails chipped and broken and the rest look good.  Thankfully my nails looked good for my wedding the next day.  The people here are super friendly and treated us really well.  Just disappointed that I thought gel nails last at least a week or two but mine lasted 3 days.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmap_id>0x80dc704f37769039:0x1dbb2d408aa7a0af< /gmap_id>< resp>

I was a walk in and immediately seated for a full set.  Vicky was great. The pink she initially chose was a little too pink, and had no issue creating a color I liked. Amazing customer service and super clean. I will be returning.< /review>

Terrible experience!  I told them I wanted only basic manicure & basic pedicure when she was finished with my pedicure she said it was an extra $5 for sanding 2 toe nails.  My total came out to $40.  I had a gift certificate for $60  she then told me I owe $20 that the certificate was for $ 20 only.  U should see my certificate now scratch out $60 , handwriting I don't understand. Expiration date. N/A now it has May_____.   Totally unprofessional.  I hope I don't have any problems when I go to use certificate.</text>

Ok, so I go here because it is more convenient for me, but it’s not the first time that I am not happy with the results, I went for pedicure and manicure, pedicure was fine, now the manicure.... worst one I’ve had, for what they charge it should be better than this. I guess its time to find a new place.</Text>

Terrible service.
Very pushy. Told them what I wanted and they kept trying to.push for more expensive things.
Hurt my husband why doing his pedicure and then barely did a pedicure on him.
Mumbled alot and I couldn't understand. At one point told me I am super white and dry? Dunno why she did that.
Then charged me twice. Told me it wouldn't charge but behold it charged me. Went to ask what was up they told me not to worry and that it wouldn't be refunded.
If I could give no stars I would. I am genuinely disappointed because I used to come here all the time. Will never come back or recommend.<//Text>

This was my first time going to this specific location of happiness nails & I wish I could say only positive things but unfortunately my experience wasn’t the best. I received way better service at Happiness nails & have been going to them for years. I went in today, 05/23, to get two broken nails fixed & waited about 5 minutes before being seated. I tried finding the right color but ended up with something similar. I ask the lady for some help finding the color & she completely gave me an attitude with a face remark like no, it’s whatever. This will be my first & last time coming to this location...< /Review>

I absolutely love Happiness Nails. My friend and I have been coming here for a total 10 year. We both had moved out of California and recently returned. It has been almost 4 years since we were here and all of the staff remember us and made us feel like we were at home. I have been disappointed with any of services I have had with any of the nail artists. This has always been my favorite nail salon to go to. The staff is super friendly and accommodating and they all do an amazing job!<//Review>

My nails turned out horrible and crooked. I got acrylics and the lady that worked on them butchered my fingers so bad. I love getting my nails done and nobody has done this ever to me. I've had scrapes before but not this bad.  Some of the workers rush things sometimes.</Review>

<review>All the ladies here are very detailed and my nails always look perfect after each visit. They also know many designs and always catch up with new trend. Today i came to have shellac Manicure and it was amazing. My tech asked what color I wanted and she knew exactly what to do. I really loved the results. The place was really clean and neat with some modern tools and comfortable chairs. I highly recommend them and will be back soon.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Very bad service! I waited for a good 30mins before someone helped me. I understand they’re short staff but it could be nice to let me know/talk to me that it’ll be a long wait. The quality of work is poor. I could’ve done my nails on my own. The nail polish(gel) was applied uneven. Unprofessional environment, their equipments and other things they use are noticeably not sanitized. The whole store smells funky too. Overall, it’s not a good place to get your nails done.</text>

Absolutely horrible service. The water was cold for my pedicure and I was expected to sit in it. I walked out. This is the second bad experience. I tried to write off the first one as an exception. Do not go here if you are trying to get good service.<//text>

<text>My friend drop me off at this salon to get my manicure done. She claims that its the best place to get it done. I was skeptical at first but boy I was wrong. The salon is very clean. The techs working here are very friendly. Throughout my manicure the nail tech working on my nail was very gentle with me. Not once did she cut me or pierce my skin. When she was done, I was very impress with how lovely my nails looked! Really wish I had this kind of services back at home. I highly recommend anyone living in the area to get their manicure done here!<//text><rating>5</rating><name>Julia Roberts</name>< userid>

So I went to check the place out. To my surprise she was right. The techs are really good! The nail tech I got was very gentle and would massage my hand whenever she can. It was really relaxing.

My girlfriend and I were in the area so we decided let's get a pedicure. We both wanted was a normal pedicure. Very quick and clean. I love how they massage your lower legs and feet with hot stone. I would come back if I were to be in the area again.<//review>

the ONLY place in Oceanside that is worth the money. only place that the gel manicures last 3+ weeks. foot massage is amazing. they do not skimp on time either. if you order extra massage, they first give you what comes with the pedicure and then start the timer for the additional massage. Van is amazing!</text>

<Text>All I can say is, ASK FOR CAM.  She does it your way and really cares about you leaving satisfied.  She doesn't do acrylics, but is FANTASTIC at manicure (shellac) and pedicures.  She doesn't rush (like some of the others do)... and it's oh so very relaxing.  John does a great job on shellac too (but you have to ask him to remove old product with acetone or else he'll use a drill which damages natural nails).  I bet he'd use only acetone if you asked him to!  Ask!!  :).<//Text>< username>

Went in for a simple manicure and was so busy trying to sell me on upgrades  ( that I did get ) and still got the worst job ever .
Cuticle were not done good at all and when I got in the car and took a better look realized one nail was split and she didn't even catch it .
I went back in and another girl fixed everything but no apologies just stone face silence . The $13 simple manicure I went in for now cost me over $30  after tipping 2 times because another girl had to fix my nails (I cant not tip the 2nd girl weren't he fault ) but not even an apology from anyone !!  It's no wonder there was no one in this place !!! Never again! If I could leave no stars I would ...<//Review>< pictures>

Convenient location, semi-friendly staff, decent service. Pleased with my pedicure; however, my manicure was lack-luster. The technician rushed my manicure in order to serve more customers. My nails had a scratchy, hard feel afterwards. Will not be returning.< /review>

I had received a good pedicure @ this salon and went back. This time they were busy and said just wait 5 minutes...it was at least 15 minutes or more. If they had been honest I would have come back another time. After all a busy shop is a good sign or so I thought. Finally they squeezed me into a crowded corner and an odd guy with a rude demeanor began working on me. He spoke constantly in his native tounge to the other employees but couldn't be bother to say a word to me. He seemed to be gossiping and talking about clients including me. In the end it was the worst pedicure I have ever gotten. An extremely disappointing experience. I won't be going back.</Text>

$20 dollar pedicure that doest include scrub and cuticle trim?!! So I ended up paying $28 for the scrub and cuticle trim. She literally scrubbed my foot for 15 seconds. She barely even cut my toenails! This place is a ripoff! I expect more for 30 bucks....</review>

I went the next day, and they said they would fix it but had bad attitude about it and started speaking in their native tongue and the guy who did them came and told me I had messed with them. Anyways, when the lady was trying to remove the color off the nails it was taking too long so she sand them down and redid them, and of course, when I’m heading to my event, while closing a zipper (not adding pressure) the nail chipped off. Never again will I go there, paid $50 for them and not worth it.< /review>< Pics>

Worst experience ever and I wasn't the one getting my nails done. My daughter was for prom. I stepped  out for a moment and the guys doing her nails decided to do what he thought was best, not what she asked for. When we question him he was upset and through an adult tantrum. Fixing the problem was not an option for him. BEWARE!!!<//review>

Mai is my technician, and my pedicures would last for months if my nails didn't grow!  And I'm a sandals every day person.  I have zero experience with any of the other technicians, but I've been seeing some of the same faces for years, and they always seem busy.  Some faces come and go, but there are a few techs who have been there a long time. The salon is cleaner than it used to be and they keep upgrading their chairs and adding more chairs.  I have noticed it getting markedly more popular though.  The last time I was there, the place was packed and there were people waiting, so I recommend making an appointment, just to be safe. When you do, your tech meets you at the door and you are VIP'd straight to a waiting chair.  There is a huge difference in price between the regular pedicure, and the spa pedicure, so be sure to ask for prices along the way, when you are offered something.  I do the spa pedi because my skin feels so wonderful afterward. I love the exfoliating massage part of it, but it does climb up to $35 by the time you add the nail art. I think their pedi prices are reversed on their spa package list, so I can't advise you on which description to use - the euro, deluxe or regular. But you'll want to confirm the price and details of each. The music and atmosphere are very relaxing.  Hard to believe with so many people in the same room, but it's easy to fall asleep in the massage chairs.< /text>

I have gone to this shop multiple times to see if maybe they were just having an off day. the first time the nail lady ended up cutting my finger with the dremel, and then put rubbing alcohol on the cut. The nails were uneven, crooked, and painted horrible. The second time, the lady insisted she could do a design with cheetah print, but when it came down to it she couldn't do the design at all and shot down all my other ideas. I have been disappointed every time I have gone. They rush you, nails are always crooked and look horrible!! I would never recommend this place!</review>

<review>I did a simple pink color and the lady who did my nails wasn't too kind and she seemed to be hurried and didn't car about doing my nails nicely . I asked if she could do gel and she threw a small tantrum . My nails ended up looking alrightish from far away but they are uneven and a bit bubbly . Honestly they need better customer service and it seems like they ridicule their customers .<//review>< pics>

<Review>Much of the effort in keeping this park nice seems to have been focused on the baseball fields. There is a playground, but it's a joke: Two concrete pipes and a swing set. There are four places for swings; one of which is missing, one of which is a baby swing where the seat is set at adult chest level, making it difficult to get kid in and out. There's a horseshoe pit; who plays horseshoes? Just not an attractive looking park, no wonder no one was there on a nice spring day. Really disappointing.<//Review>< user_name>

To many men around the park who aren't supposed to be there, it's a children's park, not a place to go and do bad things. It's not safe at all I think, before there was cops everywhere and I felt safe, now there isn't not one cop and people just come and do whatever they want there.<//text>

<review>I really love this park because I grew up one block away. I spend my child hood playing little league baseball. I also bring my kids here to play in the playground and everytime I bring my kids they always bump into some one that they know and start playing together. It brings a smile to my face because It used to happen to me too.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< time>

(Translated by Google) It is very good, only that it lacks a lamp or lighting on the basketball courts and also a shade that covers at least one court since in the summer the sun is very hot.

(Original)
Está muy bien , solo que le falta una lámpara o iluminación en las canchas de básquetbol y también una sombra algo que cubra por lo menos una cancha  ya que en verano está muy quemoso el sol.</Review>
