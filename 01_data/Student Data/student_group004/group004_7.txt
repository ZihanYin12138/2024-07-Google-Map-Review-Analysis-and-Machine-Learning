<review>I was in San Diego on vacation. I had a liquid spill on my Macbook. They took it in immediately and did a chemical clean. They got my Macbook up and running in 2 days. They were very friendly, however their communication could be better. I was initially told the repair would be same-day. I had to reach out multiple times to get updates on my computer and to receive a report on the findings/diagnosis after I picked up my computer. I also did not like that they put 3 stickers on my Mac, though they came off easily. Overall, I had a good experience and would return. Improvement could be made by being more upfront/realistic about repair times. They would also do better to provide the customer with an in-depth review of what will be done when the drop off is made, and provide diagnosis/repair paperwork to the customer upon pickup.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dc003f6bc73203:0x7c9d4f3c0eef10cd</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Wow! What a great place. Took my LG HDTV in, as the input things had stopped working. I asked if I should leave it with him, and Ned the owner said, let me run some test now to avoid checking in fee. He was so genuine and happy that he diognosed my tv. I would not hesitate to go here for any electronic problems. Old School ethics, which now a days is hard to find.<//review>

<Review>Top notch on every level!!
It's amazing to not be told, that my "vintage" macbook pro cannot be repaired as it's too old and parts are no longer available.  Even more amazing is to have it back in under a day, working perfectly, and for a very affordable price!!!

Courteous, responsible, and keeping their word every time, I can truly state that you won't ever go wrong placing your trust in them.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dc003f6bc73203:0x7c9d4f3c0eef10cd< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've been here twice to fix my slightly-outdated but cherished gaming laptop and they were very helpful and reasonably affordable. They didn't try to hustle me like other places. Both times I've been here they  diagnosed the problem within about one business day and got back to me with an explanation and an estimate.<//Text>

Was visiting San Diego and my laptop died. Their store was not too far from where I was staying. They checked it out, found motherboard was faulty. Contacted me with price and fixed it.  Shipped it back to LA in under a week. They kept me fully informed by phone of progress etc. Would recommend them.</Text>

< Review>
My 74 year old step father has been the willing recipient of price gouging for many years by the owner Rod, I agreed to allow him to use Rod to assist me with very specific issue I was having with my business website. I needed a web developer to repair configuration issues I was having with e-store plug-in woocommerce, the transaction platform STRIPE and my shipping manager, shipstation. I'm now unable to sell my product online. My business depends on the functionality of these systems. My needs where not respected. The instant I gave my admins/passwords to Rod I was no longer in control of my own business. I live in Sacramento so had to rely on phone or text which was just ignored. I couldn't go confront the situation and he just burned me for not doing a single thing I needed done while charging my step father $1100 to do it. I also learned that Rod wasn't doing the work as he outsourced the work he did again, work I never requested be performed. This guy was building me a whole new website?! I had a website! A nice one too! Upon realizing that he was outsourcing our project to a anonymous developer in Brazil I became furious that I no longer had control over my website. I was furious that it was happening so boldly and with audacious non chalant manner. I consistently tried to halt the work any way possible but I was just ignored by Rod.  I demand in writing to return access to my accounts and Rod finally just bluntly said no. He just locked me out of my accounts. For three weeks I've been demanding access to my website account. To con my step father, he delivers a 5 page template website that my 74 year old step father thinks is beautiful but he knows nothing about what I needed in way of my website e-store configuration. He pays Rod $1100!!!?? To charge $1100 for a website I could have built in 2 hours for $50 all because I live 500 miles away and wasn't able to take the correct measures in stopping try his scan artist the only way that would have worked best and this was with a heavy hand. Thief's like Rod, (yes this is what he is) deserve to be exposed. As I wrote this, I still don't access to my property, my business
Business for me has ground to a halt because I choose to give this company my trust, money and passwords. Added insult to injury, he switched the host server for the horrific website he delivered which includes misspelled words and headlines that were clearly drafted by someone who didnt speak English as a first language. The content comprised of online stock photos with fake testimonals to MY product. The host he switched my website to was also located in Brazile and cosy triple what I was paying for a USA based host. They had no tech support and the language was in Portuguese!!! This guy doesn't have you (the customer) in mind at all...So so unethical!
I've seen this guy take advantage of my step father for 10 years and now he found a way to do it again through me. To take advantage of the technical ignorance their elderly customers is truly a shameful way to earn a living. When I accused Rod of these acts he did nothing to deny them. He made a comment about me not having the resources to do anything about it. He threatened to spread information about me online as he said "he knows a lot of things about me" if I went public we with this information. Rod said his lawyer would slap me with a defamation lawsuit too. He told me he didn't wish to sue me for it as I had no money, which I don't.
Instead of bowing to extortion after the crime, Ive retained a lawyer and will be filing a lawsuit to recover my losses. I look forward to exposing one of the most egregious frauds I've had the displeasure to cross in many years. I hope my effort saves other innocent consumers their hard earned money by avoiding getting cheated as i had, along with my step father. It my experience that "geek available"  is only available when it's convenient and profitable for him. With my elderly step father the mark is always paying off for this guy's scams but it snarred me and my business in the process this time. Beware< /Review>

{'time': 1519060347871, 'text': 'Shame on you!\nDid you forget to state that your stepdad once again had to step in and pay for the business man that can’t get anything done right (although you are 40 years old), and even messed up your own website?\nDid you forget to mention that your stepdad (as he again is paying for your mess) requested me to not allow you to mess up the website again as he is one of the business partners in the venture? And would you like to tell everyone the sort of language you referred to him in your emails because he wanted to stop wasting money fixing everything after you messed it up?\nThe job was done for him as he requested (and you knew that, as you gave all the passwords so someone could develop the new website he requested and get you out of trouble again) and the webpage was delivered to him as well as all the passwords. Why don’t you ask him for the passwords? You are PATHETIC!\nWhy don’t you state that you were offered to get everything rolled back to the damaged content you messed up and you refused because this way you won’t know how to fix it and he won’t pay anybody else to fix that for you? So you threw a tantrum and sent even more curse-filled emails to him and to me?\nHe has been my client for almost ten years and I always did everything to help him out. I haven’t had the desire to deal with webpages for years now and only did it as he asked me to help him because he can’t stand putting any more money in your failing projects. How I regret doing that!'}</resp>

On April 13th at 3pm we called you saying we could try to repair it or you would need a new motherboard. You asked us to attempt the repair. After our partner couldn't fix it, 12 business days later, you were told that you would need a new motherboard.\n\nYOU said you needed to think about it. On june 6th - yesterday - (OVER ONE MONTH AFTER WE CONTACTED YOU)  you called back asking us to do the job and we said it was too late as parts were not available at this point. So look really well into your own case! Although it took me 12 business days to try the repair, it took YOU 1 ENTIRE MONTH to think on whether you wanted to do that or not. Do not blame on us for that! And since you dropped the computer here 7 weeks ago, you are lying by saying three months!"}</resp>

<user_name>High Class CanniBowls (Shop Bubblers online)< /user_name><text>Great service, friendly and professional workers. Although it’s worth noting, the hours are changed during Covid 19, they’re only open until 3pm Monday- Friday (until further notice) and Saturday’s they are not open, due to shortage in staff, may change. Best to call in advance if your trying to get your car serviced... But these guys are great. Joe the service tech, honest and professional, takes care of my car, reliable and helpful.

Take photos of your car inside and out if you have to use these boneheads. They screwed up my car then denied it. Major cracks in my dash, two big gauges in the console, forgot to hook up all kinds of stuff. Just don't go there! If I could give them a - 10 I would. Hope someday karma will repay them.< /review>

I bring all 6 of my vehicles here to have the oil changed. I've never had any issue at all with the service I've been given. I do recommend this place for their services. Very professional and straightforward with me and they have never tried to pull anything shady on my wife.< /Text>

I gave them a credit card to pay the bill and they told me the credit card machine was not working properly after they ran the card thru the machine, I paid them cash and they charge my credit card too, a simple oil change was $103.90, what a bunch of thieves, I will NEVER go there again. They are not even answering the phone. Very, very DISHONEST  people.</Review>

Great place to just chill if your looking for a relaxed bar vibe, but without the alcohol. Good quality kava. Great customer service, gave me a free drink on the house for my first time. Knowledgeable and helpful for first timers. Will return again!</Text>

<Review>Excellent place to spend an hour or two, and relax to the numbing effects of the kava root. Sink into their couches and dream of the world gone past. The host is nice enough to offer samples to first timers. Traditional kava is more medicinal than flavorful, as it tastes like a chalk board. However with all medicine, once you grunt the unpleasant taste, the magic begins. I had 2.5 doubles and my neck was tingling all night. Will return soon!< /Review>< pictures>

Why is this place called a bar??? "Non alcoholic drinks!?” The bartender was rude, and made my friend and I feel unwelcome. The drinks were gross!!!<//Review>

Kava is good once your palate can get used to the taste. The environment is relaxing and the staff is friendly. They have a a few tables, a few couches, a bar and even a patio in the back for more room to hang out.< /text>

Fun place.  Get there before 7pm for discounted happy hour prices.  A little clique-y but really nice.  They're informative about the kava traditions and have reverence for the root.< /Review>

LOVE this place, wouldn't have tried Kava has Kava Collective not been around! Amazing social staff, hip vibe, stacked with meditation room/art gallery, louge, back deck seating, bar etc. Chris the director of sales is wicked friendly, he's a fun creative to talk to! Ginger Kava is my favorite!<//Review>

Their kava is not as strong as I'm used to but where I used to go in my hometown, they made a strong batch separate from the regular batch so I got used to that. Still highly recommend if you and would like to try kava or already like it.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Horrible horrible customer service. Called for pick up and the worker hung up on me then when I called back he Said " I don't know what the hell you want we don't have a smoked turkey sandwich." Whoever is working 10/28 at 1:30 pm should be fired he does not care about your business at all. I will attach the menu I was ordering off of if you would like to show that horrible human being. If the incorrect menu was online he should have said where to find the correct version not hang up on someone then curse at them when they call back.</review>

Excellent taste and quality, portions were large. Price was a bit high, so this place will have to remain a “treat” for a family on a budget.</review>

I have a love/hate relationship with this establishment. The food is always good. The Paradiso salad is perfection! BUT. If you have the wonderful opportunity to interact with the owner he may dampen your experience. Mr. Personality. (Sarcasm). But when he's not there it's great. Pascual (one of the cooks), on the other hand, is great. Very nice, very approachable.</text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>I tried placing an order & the man on the phone was very rude! I was trying to ask for a side of rice & he just kept pushing it saying "name, name, name" after I had already given it to him.  Then I told him "can you please stop being rude I just want to place my order" he then hung up. My parents have always loved going there but not anymore. My mom also tried placing the order a few min later for herself (Mother's Day) and once they heard it was the same order the man said "were not open bye" and hung up. To me that was very rude I've never had customer service be that bad & I understand it might be busy but I had already given a name & was just asking a question. I don't give attitude especially now because I know they probably don't want to be there during a pandemic. Thanks for nothing & your bad customer service!!!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Went in for a sandwich and the person behind the counter doesn't have change for a 20. So I get a jalisco de Estrella that apparently cost 7.50 and don't get my change back now I'm no math professor but 9.54+7.50=20< /Review>

A bit pricey,  but, so far, the quality cant be beat. Excellent food.  Owner usually there. Kinda creepy guy,  but harmless.</Text>

Horrible customer service, went in today and got over charged, luckily i checked my receipt and noticed i was over charged by 8$$  . Then luckily it was fixed. As we waiting to get our food we noticed there ketchup was expired. 2 years old. Decided to not say anything since we didn't use it. We got our food, food was delicious then we tried our rice.  It was gross! Tasted so old, and even smelled gross. My husband got up and told the owner and the owner didn't care one bit. He said "everyone else is eating it, so it must not be bad". Are you serious. What kind of response is that from an owner. We then got up and left. Horrible horrible horrible. They are lucky google makes you rate them 1 star because they deserve none at all. Beware and look at your receipts and everything around you. Will not be back!!<//Text>

It was my first time adopting from a shelter but their facilities are great! Eveything is cleaned and all the animals are so loved while they're there! I went to adopt 1 kitten but I left with 2 kittens! It was great and I felt safe the whole time there!<//Text>

<Review>I could not be more disappointed with our recent experience. My daughter had rescued a 2 week old kitten at Denio’s , and brought it here with the clear understanding that she would be adopting it once it was available. She called weekly to learn the status. Her last call was one week ago today, and she was told no spay date had been set. Today she called and the kitten had been spayed Thursday and adopted out over the weekend, although it was stated in the file that the kitten was already spoken for. Their excuse was, “Someone new handled the adoption.” She is, of course, broken-hearted. It’s a shame that this organization which purports to care for animals, cares so little for those who love them. We have supported the SPCA for many years, but no longer.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

No one around to ask any questions to.  Come to find out that they don't have any dogs for adoption.  With no one to ask,  About any dog. Why should I give a 5, when their was nothing or no one for me, just to ask a question. One question that's it, just one.</text>

This is a very nice facility for pet adoption. They have nice large and cozy enclosures for all pets. In addition there is a veterinary hospital and I saw that many adoptees were having neutering or dental surgeries (keeping them healthy). There are special enclosures for potential families to meet the pet. It felt like a positive and happy place.<//text>

Nice housing for the animals but service was terrible the day we went, really surprised at all the positive reviews, we had a drastically different experience. No one helped us, despite asking at the front desk, staff passed by without even saying hello or asking if they could help. We adopted a wonderful cat from a rescue elsewhere and had a very positive experience there.

Don’t go here if you just want to spend time with a variety of cats, get to know them, and pick based on your interactions, they don’t allow that.</Text>

I adopted my kitty back in May of 2016 and he is the most amazing cat I have ever had. He’s so special to me and I’m so happy he’s mine. His adoption fee was reasonable and everyone at the shelter is very kind. He was an older cat at the time of adoption, 8 years. Best personality ever he’s so loving and playful and now he’s spoiled every day. Thank you placer spca for giving me my angel!! Couldn’t be more happier with everything<//text>

The kennels are not kennels but rooms with glass and doesn't have the typical stressful shelter environment. They have several rows for dogs and a whole separate section for the cats. Animals are all well taken care of and volunteers are seen regularly walking and being in the rooms with the animals. Typical adoption prices 100-150 for dogs. Come spayed/neutered, chipped, shots, and a full behavior analysis. Very quiet for an animal shelter.

Pretty classical music playing in a relaxed setting where each dog has their own comfortable room and all the cats have all the cat furniture they could ever want.  Volunteers and staff make sure their rooms are kept clean and that they're all fed and all they're missing is someone special to take them home, as you look into their big brown eyes and see all the love they can give you. We hope to start volunteering there after taking their orientation class and workshops and then, when the time's right, adopting one of our own.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user_name>

< review>
I do my shopping in Roseville and noticed the renovation of the old Roseville Phone Co. operate yard.  Well I found out that Placer SPCA is a deceiving name.  It should be called Roseville SPCA.  I live in an unincorporated area of Placer County just west of the Roseville City limits.   I had two stray dogs come into my farm.  I took them to the "Placer SPCA" today and was told they would not take the dogs because I didn't live in Roseville City limits. I complained because of the name but was told this time were only licensed to take  animals in the Roseville City limits.  Only licensed for Roseville!  Such nonsense!</review>
<Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1578949135238, 'text': 'Hi Kim,\n\nWe are sorry for your frustration. The Placer SPCA provides all of our services to residents in Placer County with the exception of accepting strays from outside the city limits of Roseville.  We are legally unable to do so unless the city or county contracts with us for that service.  This helps to ensure that animals found in a particular jurisdiction are housed to be reunited with their owner in the appropriate facility.\n\nWe do accept owner surrendered animals from throughout Placer County and we visit other shelters frequently to bring animals into our adoption program once the legally mandated holding periods have expired.  Our spay neuter assistance program, SOS program funding veterinary, boarding and rental deposits, low cost rabies and vaccinations, food closet, humane education, kids clubs, kids camp, classroom programs, boys and girl scout programs,  and behavior assistance are available to all residents in Placer County.  We are very much the Placer SPCA.\n\nShould you have any other questions or concerns, please contact us at manager@placerspca.org or call (916) 782-7722, ext. 6166.'}<//response>< gmap_id>

Awesome facility. The people were extremely kind and helpful. They know the animals well and provided all of the information we needed. I found the perfect dog, thanks to the staff. The selection is small, but I feel like that is a pro. It's clean, bright, and quiet with no smell. I would recommend this shelter to anyone who is looking for a well handled rescue animal.</text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>My girlfriend and I came into this facility, which is very clean and well-kept by the way, hoping to adopt a cat on a Sunday afternoon. We weren't acknowledged in any way when we walked in and it took a very long time for us to catch the eye of somebody so that we could see the cats, even though there weren't a lot of people around. After having to fill out a form just to see the cats, (though many other people weren't having to fill out the form) we felt rushed to make a decision by the girl as they were closing. She was very nice but after waiting around for so long, and then being told that even if we decided we wanted to adopt the cats we wouldn't be able to take them home until Tuesday, it just seemed a little insulting. We ended up walking away without adopting anybody, which saddened me, but we ended up finding a very special cat with a rescue organization and taking him home.<//Text>< pictures>

Our kids adopted their first kitten here. The staff is great. Everyone here is very helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. We preferred rescuing opposed to buying privately and very happy we came here. I like that the kitten had all her shots, was spayed and had a pet ID. We will certainly come here again for our next pet.< /Text>

I volunteer here as a dog and cat socializer and they take great care of the animals here. I'm also glad that so many get adopted. it's not a bad thing that they sometimes don't have many dogs =)
Edit:
August 2018
I love volunteering at the new facility. The animals are so much happier and it's so clean ^^ it's slightly farther from my house but oh well.<//review>

My daughter left crying because one of the volunteers would not let us see any cats because they are not good with “children” but my child was very well behaved and has been wanting to adopt a cat. Shame on that volunteer, she is blonde, had glasses, facial hair, in a cat sweater. Never coming back here again definitely felt like my kids were discriminated against</text>

<text>This SPCA on Tahoe Ave. sold me two cats on Sunday 10-6-19. They both have tape worms. One of the cats they sold me has an eye infection. Beware when getting animals at this location because once you sign the contract all cost of care and vet bills are on you the adopter. I ask the SPCA to help my animals and they say its up to me, even though they came this way.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Really bad experience! My view of this place is, the just care only about how much you will pay for the animals! They don’t really care about anything else...<//text>

Super nice staff.. Found a kitten outside my house and brought her in.. Within a few months she was given shots and spayed! It was in August and she was adopted very shortly after! The staff was very comforting and made sure she was okay.< /Text>

<review>Incredibly caring and friendly staff. This facility seems to do a lot with little resources. The shelter is in an older facility that they have outgrown and could use some updating, but that won't be necessary because they will be moving to a brand new location in the near future. They have lots of cats and have up to about 20 dogs at a time. The dogs available can change quickly so if you are looking for just the right animal, check back often and you may find what you are looking for.<//review>< pics>

Really nice since the new building. Roomy, inviting clean.  Why are all the cats on gabapentin?!!!!???? I found that bizzarre!!!!

Update and change of opinion

This review is for Placer SPCA in general.I live on a Major Street and my daughter's cat who she got in the fall was with me while she was in LA so she got out and I had called Placer SPCA and said that it was having a difficult time getting her to come back in the house cuz. I had called them and asked for a trap and they told me that traps were only 4 capture ferrel  and spay and not for a cat who got out and you can't catch them.

I called animal control and they told me they didn't have any drops and to call the pound.  I had a large bowl on the front porch with water and I would feel it in the morning with water and ice cubes and I put a mix of dry food and canned food on the front porch and would feed Kitty.

I'm not sure if it's the folks that bought the house a few doors down from me because Kitty like to sleep on the previous tenants porch or if it was someone who was walking up and down the street that decided that Kitty was a stray and they took her and I'm not certain where they took her because when the poundgive my daughter the cat for some reason or another her information associate with the microchip was deemed as private. So if you took the cat to say the Atlantic Street but they couldn't call my daughter and say hey we have your cat they could only notify the microchip plays which would send you an email. to complicate matters my daughter had moved to LA and changed her phone number and forgot to change her number on kitties microchip.

I didn't tell you the cat was missing because I was seeing the cat on the daily and feeding it and putting water out for it and I knew that she was okay haven't seen her in a couple of days but something was eating the food and drinking the water.

lo and behold I get a text message from a kid saying why didn't you tell me kitties. I called the microchip place and they say the cat Placer SPCA.

now apparently this cat was captured once before before my daughter adopted it with no records attached to my daughter whatsoever.  And I called and I asked how much could kitty's bail was.

they transfer me to the old location I guess where they store recovered animals.  And I was told that she was there since the 28th and we're at like maybe the 16th because I was down in La visiting. and they said that being that she was a stray once before even though it wasn't under my name that she was a stray before and so it was $45 + $15 a day plus another charge because it's the second time she was brought in as a stray. Long story short kitties bail was $345. I was so heated with your information that they gave me that I just said keep the cat because number one she was not a stray she likes to go outside she likes to hang out on the front porch she likes to watch people go by she was well-fed she had food she had water someone was coming and feeding and watering while I was in Los Angeles. all this organization is to reunite pet owners with their pets why in the world would they make it cost prohibitive to for lack of a better word redeem your pet and go and pick it up when it was turned in.

First of all someone took it upon themselves turn in the, second of all no one fully explained my daughter the privacy settings on the microchip would prevent her from getting phone calls if something were to happen to, which delayed the process in collecting said said lost but not really lost pet. which just increase the cost to redeem the pet to an egregious amount we're even someone who is of comfortable means would balk at paying $345 to get their pet back.

that being said I will never advocate for the Placer SPCA ever to Infiniti again, nor will I donate one thin dime to them.

I'm still too annoyed to even think of calling them entering to negotiate be kitties fees.< /Review>

They gave my cat away.... we had a hard time moving and needed our cat to be held... we were told for the fee we paid that they would hold her for us for up to 6 months. Though we wanted to pick her up sooner, we tried picking her up 2 months later just to find out they put her up for adoption ALMOST IMMEDIATELY after dropping her off... they didn't even apologize, or try to make it up to us, didn't offer us up a credit for the "6 Month rental space". They chalked it up to a miscommunication... like are you kidding me??? Giving someone's family member away is just a big miscommunication. Don't trust these people.</text>

Okay... First off, the people are nice but extremely pushy. Small selection compared to most but a great yard to bond with your new possible pet. I decided to not get the German Shepard because of my inability to spend time with the dog. The staff is helpful but maybe too helpful since they got more in the way than anything...<//text>

Great animal shelter.  Staff & volunteers  are very courteous & helpful.  It is very clean & the animals are well fed.  I have 4 cats so I don't need to adopt any more at this time.  I still visit frequently to see the cats & drop off donations.   CATMAN</Review>

<review>Be aware they will not adopt rabbits to outdoor homes. This was not listed anywhere on their website (not even the downloadable forms, checklists, etc) and I wasted time and money going to learn this. Not to mention the disappointment. They literally would not adopt them to me.

I'm bummed that this location would rather let these animals sit in a small cage inside rather than adopt them to a loving home with lots of space outside.

Plenty of people keep rabbits outside and as a shelter I believe they shouldn't be so picky. These animals needs homes! I wonder how many other great homes have been denied the animals who stay here??!

In my specific example they have THREE rabbits that must be adopted TOGETHER, to an INDOOR home. This seems unlikely and the employee even said they had been there a while. I did a lot of research before deciding to adopt an outdoor rabbit and for every person who says indoor only there is another who says outdoor is fine.

Do they adopt cats and dogs to indoor homes only?

I really hope they reconsider this policy. It seems like a personal opinion, which is fine to have, but please let us choose....

Policies like this actually support backyard breeding, and helps continue the cycle of animals in shelters. Not only are they helping create more animals, they are simultaneously denying homes to these same animals. A double whammy to the pet population.

To give meaning to the previous paragraph I will give an example: now that I have been denied by the SPCA my only option is to get bunnies from a backyard breeder. This directly supports backyard breeding. As you know the leftover bunnies will end up at the SPCA waiting for an indoor home. They didn't get adopted the first time around, to indoor OR outdoor homes. What are the chances they will get adopted the second or third time around, when you cut the housing prospects in half? Not only this but the bunnies I get from a backyard breeder might be sexed wrong and result in 8 more bunnies in the shelter. Since my backyard breeder bunnies aren't fixed, and I don't want to pay for the procedure, these bunnies also end up at the SPCA. 8 babies, 2 parents, plus the 3 they refused me. This policy might result in 13 bunnies in the shelter, PER PERSON! Not to mention the parents brothers and sisters from the backyard breeder.

PLEASE CHANGE YOUR POLICY ON INDOOR ONLY HOMES!

The picture is my lovely outdoor rabbit hutch. It's a bit overgrown since nothing is eating the grass!<//review>< userid>

I went into look for a new family member. Very clean . After looking at the dogs, I went to the front to inquire where a man with a beard was sitting and he proceeded to show a lady who was just walking by , his side business on his cell phone . Knifes made out of railroad ties .Then picked up the phone with out making eye contact or even acknowledging  me. Very rude ! They really need to work on there customer service skills. I will adopt in Sacramento !  So sad for the animals there.< /Text>

I keep looking at the Roseville and Sacramento shelters, but haven't yet found the dig for me. Mainly the shelters have pit bulls and Chihuahuas, my experience. I need to go more frequently. I am glad the shelters exist and grateful for the employees.</review>

<text>The Roseville spca was amazing in helping me find the perfect fur baby. I had previously adopted an older cat a few days ago, and he ended up becoming very sick. I took him to the vet and his medications did not help and he became worse .i had only had this cat for 4 days! And he was on deaths door. I brought him back to the aspca and they took him back and immediately gave him an exam. He’s in good hands now and I hope he pulls through. The aspca was very understanding of my situation and understood why I was upset. They were amazing in helping me find another cat. They turned my horrible situation into a good one and that’s more than I could ask for.</text><user>105187982485083645422</user>< user_name>

The place was clean. The staff seemed to be hard at work while we were there.  For all the stray animals there are that need adopting this place was almost empty. We have been here a handful of times and this has always been the case.</Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1518826783631, 'text': "Hello! We are pleased to know you had a good experience with our staff and premises. We work very hard to provide the best possible care to our animals, and we're glad to see that came across in your visit.\n\nWe receive as many as 4,000 animals every year. Fortunately we have tremendous programs that help us reunite lost animals with their owners and we have a hugely successful adoption program.  Every day is different here and we never know what to expect. Whether we are overflowing with animals or have fewer at our center, we work very hard to ensure they are receiving the best care possible and that we are doing everything we can to find them their permanent homes. Our placement programs are so successful, when we do find that we have extra available space, we allocate resources to find animals that we can transfer in to our center from surrounding animal welfare organizations. This allows us to maintain a selection of available pets for the public to adopt, and also finds homes for animals in overcrowded shelters much more quickly - a win-win solution!\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave your feedback, and we hope to be able to serve you again in the future."}</Resp></record>

I have been vlunteering here for about 4 years now and I love it here. I am a dog socializer. The staff and volunteers are very friendlyband willing to help if you need anything. I highly recommend this (no-kill) shelter in order to find your friendly companion. They have a great selection.<//Text>

< review>
This jewelry store has very nice associates and managers starting in August 24th 2017. They sell watches, rings, necklaces and some kids items rarely besides all jewelry. In the Puente hills mall, they offer and give out candy to customers or cookies on specific holidays of the year. This Daniel's Jewelers in Puente hills mall had a rating of 3/5 stars now as I checked. More reviews as I requested more customers to come to buy jewelry here for all purposes. I started having a bad experience with this jewelry store since I was 19 years old In year 2015 and the previous manager named Don Clark was very rude to me, called me a Nick-name I didn't want to be called and had 0 out of 5 stars and no reviews back when he was there. I wish the previous manager Don Clark gets fired, retires from his jobs and is away from human society. He asked me a personal question about my life in the future and it was none of his business. This jewelry store gets better with the new female manager named Chess, Lisa and Marissa working here to get me more comfortable and less miserable with my visits to this store.< /review>

I was very upset in how they trick and cheat you. Overpriced and pressure tactics. Even though they claim to refund 100 % I was charged $90 to size wedding band set they were charging me $6 000. I caught that they tried to sneak in another  $999.99 for insurance without telling me. I had them remove the charge. Then they charged $90 to size it. When I found sane rings for hAlf the price- they tried to drop the price by almost $1000. But when I told them I wanted to cancel they charged me amother  $90 to size it back. I'm out $180. And no ring. Don't set foot here!!!<//review>

I'm grieving right now and the staff made me feel alright again if only for a few moments with all this pain I have. I'm so thankful for the tenderness they showed and wish for them to know... And all this before even mentioning the quality of the pizza! What a masterpiece it was! I looked at every place in town and this place was a clear stand out. Let me put it this way, anyplace that offers a dozen different choices for cheeses to be flame kisses on their magnificent pieces of art should be held in the highest praise. I wanted one last horrah before having to come back to reality tomorrow and this place was absolutely the perfect choice... Thank you Blaze Pizza and especially Celia for warming my heart and soul.</text>

Most of the time the place is a mess, pretty stingy with the cheese (can't even taste it in the dough knots), the cheese bread has no flavor, overall the pizza is great but the facility and menu needs some serious updates.</text>

<Review>I have been a regular at this Blaze location for over 2 years and have loved seeing the staff be friendly and helpful every time. After they closed for a short period of time, I’m assuming for COVID-19 reasons, I have seen the staff look overwhelmingly tired. There are only about 3 workers every time I come into the store and I am concerned since it is usually very busy when I order. Being a former fast-food worker, I do not think these working conditions should not be acceptable for these young people considering the stressful environment caused by COVID-19. I suggest better treatment and hiring more people so the staff can once again be comfortable seeing their regulars and not be overwhelmed after long shifts.< /Review></record>

I really enjoyed this place.

The prices are based off of how many toppings or type of dough you use. The build your own pizza aspect of the restaurant is great and the prices are not bad for what you can get.

Toppings include standard choices like mozzarella cheese and pepperoni but they have others that stand out like their vegan chorizo or their spicy red sauce, this one is recommended.Customizing your pizza is easy since all of the toppings are labeled and the folks behind the counter are always willing to add more of your preferred topping or sauce if requested.

For drinks they offer beer on tap or bottled, aguas frescas and other drinks in bottles on top of fountain drinks.

Salads are also offered, but I have never ordered one.

Pretty good choice if you wanna sit down to eat or on the go.< /Text>

When they took my order for a gluten free pizza. They gave myself and the party of 5 I was with, with horrible attitude like service.
My pizza was under cooked so I asked them to throw it back into the oven, when I got it back it looked like someone barfed on it. No offer to make me a new one just handed it back to me here you go.
Very disappointed with everything it literally made me sick I'm never going back to this place< /text>

I was blown away, by far the best pizza in Los Banos and possibly within a 45 minute drive too. It is thin crust but not too thin. I got the two topping make your own pizza with pesto for the sauce, gorgonzola for the cheese, and chicken and applewood smoked bacon as the toppings. It was so so very good. Got it to go and it stayed delicious until I got hope and ate it! So I glad to have them in Los Banos.<//text>

Only place that serves vegan pizza/cheese in this town. They ran out, but didn't get to ask until ten minutes after getting there and waiting in line. The order taker was very nice and apologetic, though.< /Review>

<review>Concept is good, pizza is great but for some reason whenever I go into this location, I have to ask several times for the same toppings. If I ask for pepperoni, they will put five pieces on the whole pizza, then I have to ask at least two more times for more. This is the same for every topping we ask for. It has to be from the owner because every employee I’ve encountered has done the exact same thing.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80917f6abe06032b:0x1dbac61233bce0dd< /GmapID></record>

I like this pizza place since they make the dough right in front of you and the topping variety is also nice. I got myself the new chorizo which is spicy and tastes pretty good for being vegan. Other toppings were chicken bacon and sausage. Would eat again.<//Review>

Love coming but the last time I went there was 4 workers and they just stood there talking and looking at me and my friend. And line built up and there was still only 2 people helping and once our pizzas were ready for the oven they lagged aswell, even though there were no order ahead of ours.< /Review>

Pizza doesn't have as many toppings available as Mod or Pieology, but the quality is still great and relatively fresh.

It was my first time here, and also my first time trying one of their chocolate cookies. Can 300% be positive that I will go back just for those cookies. One of the best I've tried in a very long time. They're very yum.</review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>When I go to any restaurant I like to examine things, I like to see the workers changing gloves and such. Well i went in a few days ago and the first thing I see is the dough lady (of course, shes right where the line starts) and what do I see? I see her cell phone ON the counter. This lady had her cellphone on the counter where she is portioning out the dough. I'd like to think we are all well knowledgeable about how dirty our phones can be. They are in fact the dirtiest things we come on contact on a daily basis. This is disgusting. Apparently this lady doesnt have that common sense. I get it we all have emergencies and we worry but put that shii in your pocket NOT where my food is.

Aside from that, I came in with a discount which the owner read out the total price to me to be WAY different than what I was actually charged. She actually charged me full price.

Thanks for your filthy service.<//review>< pics>

Tried Blaze Pizza for the first time today. The pizza was delicious. I like a thin crust. The chicken tasted like real chicken and the white sauce was really good. The Caesar Salad wasn't bad- would have liked it a little colder. I loved being able to pre-order it on my phone app.  The only other thing was that it was difficult to talk to the person across from me because the music was really loud.</Review>

<text>Ordering a gluten free pizza with allergy alert to wheat shouldn't be so much trouble. They will offer a glove change but then use the same sauce and ladle that are all over the wheat pizzas. After all the trouble, the pizza tasted great.
The attitudes of the employees reminded me of the clicks from high school, judgy, critical, mocking... Never should these attitudes come from customer service! This is who they hire to represent a million dollar company?!
I hope the Los Banos location improve because I really like some of their other locations.<//text>< pics>

This place has become a family favorite. We tend to come every Friday. Very thin crust, and flavorful toppings.<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Going down hill fast, second trip in a row we bought burnt pizzas. Every bite taste burnt. I remember my first couple times going and noticing how they cut all the burnt edges off, not anymore. They leave a half inch of burnt crust on the edges, but that is nothing when you look at the bottom. Ordered 2 pizzas with arugula, only one came with double. Seems like employees hate their job. I cant come back<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Good pizza, as many toppings as you want.  Food line was a bit understaffed and slow however, but pizza did cook fast once it hit the oven.</Text>

I love it here. You can hike. You can camp.  You can fish. You can bring the kids with you and there’s a park where they can play.  The lake is clean and nice.  The portable bathrooms are clean. I cannot say anything Badd about this place.  The pictures alone will show you. If you want to come here, come u won’t regret it.< /review><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80db8ccd0fa28dcf:0x358b323af9715db8</gmap_id>< UserId.>

My all time favorite camp site so close to everything yet a far away feel. We have made this place a family tradition and where my family and I open the family camping season. Been coming here for the past 5 years and looking forward to our camping trip coming up in a couple weeks. Try both city views and lake views campsites.< /review>

Every time we come to Escondido we stay at Dixon Lake. Most of the hook-up sites are good, Dixon reservations has pictures of each site, so you can see what's best for your camping needs. We like site 11, it gives a front view of the lake and an over view of the city.<//review>

This place is the best thing that Escondido has going for it and it's kind of a secret not discussed much. However everyone should check this place out. This lake and its surrounding areas are absolutely beautiful.  This is an a time favorite place to go and relax in a very quiet and tranquil environment.< /Review>

Beautiful place I wish I could give it 5 stars especially when all the locals leave but they have a massive yellow jacket problem that the rangers will do nothing about. The rangers have enough time on their hands to drive by every 30 minutes if not less but seem to be to busy to do anything about the unchecked poison oak growth that surrounds the lake but they can put up signs about it everywhere and not one sign warning of the rattle snakes that I  came across just walking down the road. Their constant driving by makes you feel like they think your doing something wrong and ruins any relaxing atmosphere. The two days I was here I couldn't see any useful purpose these rangers served and there like 15 of them. What a waste man power and payroll.<//Text>

<Date>1552966248351</Date><text>We enjoyed our one-day visit to Dixon Lake. We took one of several hikes in the area and also hiked up to Daley Ranch. Easy place to park if you just want to hike, and you don't have to pay for parking when parking at the trailhead instead of going into the park itself. It's also a good place to boat, fish, camp, picnic and do outdoor sports.< /text><gmapID>0x80db8ccd0fa28dcf:0x358b323af9715db8< /gmapID><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response><rate>5</rate><UserId.>114483136190007237017</UserId.></record>

<Text>Opens at 6, closes at 5 and boats due back before 3:45. 7 bucks to fish. 2 bucks more for 2nd rod permit. 35 for all day motorboat rental. All this and additional tackle can be purchased at the consession stand. They have food and snacks there as well. The bass fishing here is tough so be prepared for skunks. There are roads that lead to other shoreline spots and floating piers.</Text>< Pictures>

Million dollar views of both lake and city. Can I just live here!  Showers are hot. Lake is beautiful. Rent anything by the hour- paddle boat, fishing boat. Bring your own fishing gear they have some, but too pricy.<//Review>

Beautiful spot to spend the day outdoors. You can even stay overnight at the campground! Mountain biking, hiking, trail running, fishing, boating and horseback riding are all spectacular ways to take it all in. Worth the trip!</Review>

Nice place for picnics and camping. Dogs are welcome but MUST be on leashes and kept close! Fishing is permitted here too.

I recommend renting out a boat for fun if you're comfortable around water. The campsites have some really nice views of the city. Just be mindful of rattlesnakes.</Review>

She honestly looked like she hated her job so much. Unfortunately she wasn’t the only one with that face. But that didn’t stop us from having fun!! My family and I enjoyed this beautiful lake and the amazing view. Too bad the people working there looked miserable 😩. Another thing I noticed was that there was no diversity within the employees. I only saw one color and that’s all! We need to bring DIVERSITY into these parks, it’s very important for this new generation of children to see it. 🙏🏼❤️</text>< pictures>

Very nice little lake and campground...if anyone sneezes u will hear it. Even worse if they honk their horn or an alarm goes off. Ouch. Very clean park and decent staff tho.< /Review>

<Text>I've camped here several times. It's just odd, can't touch the water, I know it's a reservoir, no wood burning in the fire pits of the camp sites. No trails that go around the whole lake. Apparently the dam is private property. I don't know I just don't get the out doory feel when I camp there.</Text>< Pics>

<text>I go here often, the staff is always very cool and the scenery is gorgeous. It's a little hard some days to catch fish here but that's because it's a hot spot, still well worth the time to be spent here. Stop by at Dixon lake and see for yourself! You'll know exactly what I mean once you do.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Dixon Lake is a great little place close by to go camping. It has several sites with a great view of the city at night or the lake during the day. Rangers are friendly and helpful, camping is resonably priced, and if you have time to take a boat out the next day it is pretty fun. No firewood, charcoal fires only.</Review>< GmapID>

Rented a cabin at Dixon Lake for 4 days with a friend it was 4 wonderful glorious days days I'm sure not to forget anytime soon, they have paddle boats, regular paddle board,flushing toilets with toilet paper,  we went fishing had a great time at that , their store sales fishing gear in case you forgot something reasonable prices too.I took a walk later in the evenings beautiful to watch Escondido lights come on in  the town just before night fall ,so quite there you forget there are others there, Google Dixon Lake read up on it you will find yourself making reservations or just grave a one day liesense and go fishing and wait for that eager bite, enjoy yourself I did , and yes ill go back again and again, thanks to all at Dixon Lake employees  who made my visit fun, enjoyable and relaxing, from one happy camper</text>

I contacted Jose on a Saturday morning after realizing water had gotten into my computer and fried out my battery. Jose was able to see me that afternoon and without any frills, opened up the machine, determined the issue and gave me a straightforward, upfront repair and pricing estimate. His price was incredibly fair and reasonable, and reflected the nature of the age of the machine. It was refreshing to find someone like Jose, who really knows his stuff, has the resources and ability to make repairs quickly, and is professional and courteous. There was never any hidden costs or anything below board. I can't recommend him enough for any Mac user. Jose understands that time is of the essence for many of us because we rely on our computers to work and do business, and he was able to get my repair out with 24 hours to spare. I got my machine an entire day earlier than expected! Thanks again Jose for being a real one and for making sure that older Macs are taken care of.< /review>

<Text>I recently had water damage to my MacBook Pro. So, I looked up Apple certified repair shops and took my laptop to get fixed. After a couple of days, they got back to me with a $2000 estimate, and even charged $60 just for diagnostics. I declined and found BDJ repair. Jose repaired my computer in under 24 hours. He was upfront and honest, and said it would be much cheaper to repair the Logic Board instead of replacing it. The "Apple Certified" dealers didn't even mention that possibility. Not only did I get my laptop back in less time than it took the other guys to run diagnostics, but at a quarter of the price. And Jose didn't even charge a separate diagnostics fee. This is definitely the place to go to in a pinch.< /Text>< gmap_id>

I can't stress enough how great of a service Jose did! I thought I was going to have to get a whole new MacBook Pro but Jose did wonders and charged me about half the price that apple quoted they would. And that's if they could fix the logic board, as their rep said. 100% take your computer to him and you will be glad you did. Very cost effective!</review>

This place is awesome. I took my computer to another repair shop the week before and they told me my LCD and logic board needed to be replaced and my hard drive was going bad. I took it to BDJ Macbook Logic Board Repair for a second opinion and they were able to make a small repair to the logic board to fix it. I would recommend this place to everyone looking for honest and professional opinion.< /text>

Jose was amazing! He was thorough and made sure all details were taken care of and the repair on my MacBook Pro was flawless. I was getting it fixed for a friend as a gift and I am even more grateful because he is making my friend even more happy!😊 Thanks again and God forbid any of my other Macs break in the future, but if they do I know where I'll be bringing them!<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>So my fan went out on my 2012 MacBook Pro. I bought the part online and attempted my own repair. In the process I disconnected the fan connector from the mother board...No good!! I contacted BDJ and they said they could fix it. I was expecting a high price and a run around. NOPE!! Jose grabbed my laptop, popped it open, found the problem, fixed it closed it back up and I was done in 5 MINUTES!!! He charged me an EXTREMELY fair price. So thankful and would recommend him to anyone having an issue with your MAC or Iphone! Jose is the real deal!!!</Review>< pictures>

He is also the most reasonably priced tech out there with years of experience and will be honest with you. A while back he tried to fix an old I pad that my baby had destroyed, wasn’t able to fix it and didn’t charge me for trying since he couldn’t fix it. That type of honesty and fairness is hard to find nowadays!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I was so pleased by the great services and expediency I received.
My 2012 Mac Book Pro needed a new battery and I needed my computer that same day for an important work project.
Jose had me in and out in 40 minutes, he was also extremely gracious.
The price was affordable.
This has now become my new go to place.</Review>

I sent my 2014 15" MacBook Pro to BDJ Macbook Logic Board Repair after damaging the keyboard connector while attempting to replace the battery. They were able to repair my computer, and bring it back to life. The price for the repair was reasonable, and I received my computer back in good condition (which is more than I can say for the people that Apple contracts with to repair computers). I will say that it took longer to get my machine back than I expected (around 14 days), but it was worth the wait. I would definitely send another device here for repair if the need ever arises.< /text>

Jose did a great job fixing my old Macbook Air, fixing the logic board, adding more storage, recovering data and replacing the battery. Took a few days for them to diagnose, but then they gave me options and turned it all around in less than 24 hrs. Highly recommend.<//review>

My girlfriend's Macbook Air started randomly shutting down for no foreseeable reason, so we did a google search for macbook repair places, and BDJ came up. She brought the laptop in and met with Jose (without me - I had to work). He was a little rough around the edges from the get go, but seemed to know what he was doing. He opened her laptop and told her to feel the processor, trying to support his diagnosis of overheating being the problem. This was the first sign of trouble, as anyone who works on computers knows that feeling a processor will not tell you if it's overheating as processors often get above 150 degrees while staying within normal range of operation. He told her that the fix was to replace the logic board and that it this would cost ~$350.  She paid, and he told her he had to order the logic board and that she should bring the laptop back after he called us to let us know it had arrived.

She came home and we looked at her laptop. I did some of the diagnostic stuff they do at the Apple store and it quickly became apparent that this was a battery/charger issue and most likely had nothing to do with the logic board. I called and spoke to Jose to try explain my thoughts and perhaps get a refund for the $350 she had already paid since a battery replacement wouldn't be this much. He immediately started becoming VERY agitated and trying to rush me off the phone, saying he had other customers he had to help. He kept insisting that the logic board was the issue. The longer I kept him on the phone trying to explain the logic behind my theory, the more and more rude he became, explaining that "I told your girl to feel the processor. I told her! Have her explain to you! I don't have time. I have other customers here to take care of!" I asked him if he would refund the money if he did indeed replace the logic board, and it turned out that wasn't the issue, and he promised he would provide the refund.

Flash forward 2-weeks, I called again to see if the logic board had come in. It took him 3 tries to find the correct customer account after I gave him the invoice number he provided when we paid. He explained that the logic board had arrived and that we could bring the laptop in. We dropped it off the next day, and he called 3 days later to say the work was done.

Upon bringing the Macbook home, within the first hour or so, it began randomly shutting down just like before. I ordered a new genuine Apple magsafe charger, and low-and-behold, it stopped shutting down and everything was fine once again. This of course proved my theory that it was a power issue and not the logic board. I called Jose back and tried to explain this. He almost immediately became irate and started making all sorts of strange claims. One, he said that he was not able to test the laptop because my girlfriend "never gave him her password". He never once asked for said password, as we would have obliged if it meant he would be able to fix the issue. He then told me to bring the laptop back in, but by then, I was so appalled by the way he had spoken to me that I told him I did not want to do business with him anymore and asked that he please provide the refund he originally promised. He declined and repeated that I needed to bring the computer back in. I spent about 10 minutes on the phone with him, trying to reason with him, politely asking for the refund, explaining how what he had done did not fix the issue and how a simple charger replacement did the trick. He would not hear it and began using the "I have other customers I have to take care of" line as before. Finally, he one last time said "You want help, bring the computer back in!" and hung up the phone.

We didn't bring it back to him. As a paying customer, I've never been spoken to like Jose spoke to me on the phone, and I would highly recommend you stay away from this place. There are plenty of other Apple repair shops in the valley. You may pay a bit more elsewhere, but at least you'll avoid getting yelled at and lied to.</review>

I located this repair shop by conducting a Google search for Logic Board repair. I am happy with my decision to move forward with service. Jose was always responsive and although the service took longer than expected, my MacBook Pro is in great working condition and thus far I have not encountered any issues.

I was so pleased with Jose’s service and amazing price, that I decided to get a secondary MacBook Pro serviced the same day I picked up the first device. Jose was able to complete a full screen replacement in less than 1 hour and at a price that was much less than what I was quoted for in the OC.

I will definitely consider taking my devices back if the need arises.<//review>

Incredible service - I took it in on a Thursday at 4pm after I had some liquid damage and Jose had it ready the next day for a very affordable price! If I had gone to the apple store it would have taken 2 weeks and it would have been over 1000 dollars! Definitely the best mac repair store in LA!!</text>

I truly believe this place was God sent. I accidentally spilled wine on my MacBook and Apple and Best Buy said it was useless to repair because I would spend just as much repairing the motherboard as what I paid for it. Apple tried to get me to turn over my MacBook to them to recycle but my spirit wouldn’t allow me to get rid of it and I’m glad I didn’t. Jose opened my MacBook and immediately spotted the trouble. He quoted ma a price to repair it, which was way less than what I paid for it on sale at Best Buy, and said it would be ready within a week.  I picked up my MacBook yesterday and it works just fine. My pictures and saved documents were not lost.  I would recommend BDJ Computer Repair to anyone that is in need of a computer fix.   Thanks Jose for a job well done!!!<//text>

They only work on your computer if you can turn it on. Totally useless if your logic board is dead. BDJ Macbook Logic Board Repair are real tech geniuses. They take off the back and do the manual work of examining the physical parts. Definitely go here instead of a brand name store.<//review>

I contacted other shops and they just didn’t seem as legitimate. They were able to repair my MacBook and save all my data for a very reasonable price. Most importantly, it was done in a timely manner. Much better than the apple store<//Review><time>1609987510364< /time><gmapID>0x80c2b863b26ad8e5:0x61c0d5bf3a12dc91<//gmapID><Resp>{'time': 1609988000987, 'text': 'Thanks'}<//Resp>< Rate>

I called multiple spots on my way uptown and they either didn't have my screen in stock, needed to hold it overnight, or were asking a ridiculous price to where I could've just replaced the phone entirely. I finally called this spot around 4:45 pm and by 5 pm my screen looked brand new. Repairman took literally 10 minutes and did it right in front of me as soon as I got there.

I was looking for a quick screen replacement for my iPhone 11 as the screen was broken & touch wasn't working properly. I had an idea that it's gonna take 5-7 business days in Apple store. I was fortunate enough to find this store near me. They fixed in a one day. That's all I was looking for.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Been coming here for mostly audio-related repairs, since luckily I haven’t been hit with any computer logic board issues, or not yet. Jose is simply the best – he’s got all the tools and knowledge to fix any circuit/board you bring him. He’s also very speedy and has nonchalantly saved 2 pieces of gear in my studio. There’s a shortage of affordable audio repair companies in LA, another reason to come to this spot. Thank you Jose!< /text></record>

<Review>I have an early 2013 MacBook Pro with the dreaded (and expected) "no video" issue. I called a local placed and they wanted much more than BDJ Macbook Logic Board Repair  charged to fix this issue. I sent it to BDJ Macbook Logic Board Repair  and they did a great job fixing the issue along with communicating with me via automated site. They were able to turn my machine around in just a few days! I'm so glad I found them and will use them if I have another issue with this laptop.</Review>< pictures>

This place is a 10/10! Lets go over the pros and cons.

Pros:
Was able to walk in and receive service immediately.
My service tech was completely transparent about what needed to be done, and how much it would cost.
You could tell by the way they handled the electronics, they have been at this a long time. That gave me peace of mind.
They were able to repair my computer in 24 hours. 1 day! They sent out an email as soon as it was finished. I sent my 13month old MacBook Pro into apple and I did not receive a diagnostic for 7 business days. Absurd!
Now here is the real sticking point. Apple wanted to charge me 700+ to replace my logic board. BDJ was able to identify the problem as a short. Instead of replacing the entire board, they fixed it. Not only is this beneficial to the environment due to less technical waste. It is just the right thing to do. You have been reading this review too long. If you have a MacBook issue/Apple get in the car and drive over to BDJ MacBook Logic Board Repair NOW!!!!

Cons:
I had to pay apple a diagnostic fee !<//text>

< review>
I have brought a few of my phones here to be fixed, which he had fixed them and no problem. In September 2020 I brought him my iPad that needed the screen to be fixed. After a month he had told me he was still waiting on the screen to be delivered. He then proceeded to tell me he wanted to see me and go out with me which was totally inappropriate. I had not given him the chance so he has kept my iPad for5 months. He made up all kind of things saying he fixed the tablet and then when I wanted to pick it up he told me it stopped working again. Then Proceedes to ask me why I wouldn't go out with him. He is so unprofessional and I still have no tablet in February 2021. He tore it all apart and told me it is not working but he said in December he had fixed it. Ladies this man will use your electronic to try to go on a date with you and if you don't agree to that he will break your electronic item and tell you there's nothing he can do.</review>

At first I was mad and furious considering I had just bought this new MacBook and it’s already done for. After taking it with one specialist who told me there was nothing to do , I decided to look for a store who can help me. That’s how I came across this store and can actually say, even though I live in the OC area it was so worth coming to this store. Not only is Jose a nice person who gives off excellent customer service, he also fixed my MacBook like it was nothing! If it wasn’t because I found this store, I would’ve lost over $1000 already. Definitely worth coming here if you’d like to get electronics fixed. If you live far away, I promise you this, you won’t ever regret coming here no matter from where you come from. This place is heaven for fixing electronics that normally are for expensive cost at for cheap price. :)<//review>< Resp>

I was doubtful my grand daughters MacBook could be repaired after water was spilled on it and sat in water over night. I found this company by word of mouth so I gave it a shot! I made my appointment, Jose was knowledgeable of what the issue was and explained it to me. The price was very reasonable versus going to an Apple store, my grand daughters MacBook is working great without any issues. I will bring my equipment here as well as, I will recommend this company to my friends and family for any computer issues!! Thank you Jose job well done!!!

<Text>My demonic little kitten chewed the corner of my MacBook Air 2020 screen/display and to my shock, it cracked the entire display, rendering it useless. I called BDJ immediately after seeing a bunch of positive online reviews and I spoke to a real person right away. He asked me about the issue and the color and model number of my Mac and said if I came that day (which is what I wanted), he could repair it in 30 mins on the spot with a new screen. He did just that - but it took him on 15 mins! Whilst the Mac display isn't cheap, it also wasn't an inflated price. The service was actually incredible! I was back home within 2 hours and working online again. They literally saved me big time. Thanks guys!<//Text><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

Brought my girlfriends macbook air for repair as it was not charging or turning on (turned out to be a logic board fix).  Turn around was many days quicker than what I was told dropping it off, and the machine works perfectly to this day thank you BDJ Macbook Logic Board Repair<//Text>

I had a very great experience at BDJ Macbook Logic Board Repair! My friend accidentally spilled water all over my Macbook Air and I thought it would have to be replaced but Jose saved my laptop! Very affordable and efficient with excellent customer service so I will definitely be returning if I have any other future damage to my other electronic devices!</review>

<Text>Recently, I had the misfortune of cracking the screen on my iPad. I was referred by a friend to BDJ Macbook Logic Board Repair and immediately looked at reviews. I was very impressed by what people were saying about jose's work, so I decided to take the iPad to him. Within a few hours, it was ready for pickup. The speed with which he finished and the quality of the fixed product caused two of my family members to take a broken iPad and crashed MacBook to him. I highly recommend BDJ Macbook Logic Board Repair to anyone that has an electronic in need of repair!!! Thank you, jose, for being super professional and excelling in the quality of your work.</Text></record>

Found Jose Via a search engine.    Great experience.  Quickly diagnosed the logic board issue with my MacBook pro 2019 15in and had it repaired and back in my hands in 10 days.     Jose is a master technician.   My MacBook is good as new and works perfectly.   Very reasonable price for the dead logic board and data recovery.   Highly recommend!</review>

I took it here and José checked it out right in front of me and said it was the logic board that needed repair. Only cost $275 and took two days. I would highly recommend this place, he was very fair with costs and timing and was very nice and answered all my questions!< /Text>< Pics>

<Time>1602365957039</Time><response>{'time': 1600119275999, 'text': 'Thanks'}<//response><pictures>None<//pictures><text>So with my experience, I basically gave him a 145 for free none of my thunderbolt ports work. It was a fail a tremendous fail. Not only did I leave my laptop with him for two weeks he also failed to call me back when he said he was. I lost 145 for nothing and on top of that, he fried my LaCie drive that had all of my music sessions saved on it. I wish he told me in the beginning that he couldn't do it in the first place or didn't want to touch it like the others I could have saved the 145 and used it toward a new logic board. Or just took it to another person more qualified to do micro sander. Now I'm stuck with the same situation with only one port working on my thunderbolt and 145 in the hole. He told me two days each time and two days turned into two weeks and he would call me and this and that but I never received a call back on anything I always had to call to see if my laptop was done and each time I was told this day no that day just a complete waste of time. I drove 60 miles back and forth for absolutely nothing. This is just my experience and honest opinion if you need anything done micro sander wise take it to Apple themselves. Don't waste money here.</text><user>116887917468643205019< /user><rating>1</rating></record>

I took my macbook air in because of water damage thinking it was dead. The next day i get a message that its ready to be picked up. Like magic it started up and worked flawlessly. Very reasonably priced and could not believe how awesome the service was. 1 year after and its still going strong. I cant thank you enough. Gracias Jose!<//review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>I am beyond satisfied with the professionalism and service that Jose provided to me. I took my 2009 MacBook Pro and a 2014 iMac to be fixed. Jose right away figured out the issue for my MacBook Pro was the battery and he suggested I buy a good quality one, which fixed the issue. He didn’t charge me for it. I had taken my iMac to apple store and they said the motherboard was damaged and they suggested to just buy a new computer. Jose provided a reasonably priced quote to fix the mother board and to see if the hard drive needed to be replaced. He called me a few days later to inform me that he had successfully fixed the motherboard and replaced the hard drive. My computers are both working great and I can’t thank Jose enough for doing a fantastic job and providing amazing customer service. I took some of his business cards and I’m handing them to family and friends.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Jose did an amazing job with my Macbook Pro. My logic board was dead and he was able to replace parts in it, saving me from having to buy a whole new board. My hard drive was also bad so he replaced it and put a fresh one and included installing the iOS. He also replaced my speakers! It’s like a whole new laptop! I really appreciate the great work and the super fast service. Thank you Jose! Will definitely recommend you to everyone I know. 🙏🏼🦾🤓<//Review>< Date>

Very happy with my service! I cracked my iPhone XS and messaged him through yelp and he was very responsive. It also only took 20 mins to get it done which is really nice.
He was also really honest about getting an original screen versus generic screen in terms of quality.
I highly recommend to come here to get your phone screen fixed! :)</Text>

Jose is awesome!!!
Coffee spilled onto my 2018 macbook pro and the keyboard wasn't working anymore. I called other places in LA and they quoted me for $700+ for a job that wasn’t guaranteed .
Jose took my laptop and said if it needed to be replaced he'd do it for LESS THAN 1/3 of what others would charge. And he said if more needed to be done he'd call and let me know the price.
The keyboard was replaced and I've been using my laptop for 2 months. Sorry it took so long to write the review Jose! Thanks Again!<//Review>

I had called upon coming to the store to figure out what was going on with my computer. Apple told me they believe it was the power supply but BDJ said it was possible it was the board. I decided to make the hour drive there and he was very professional. It was a quick turnaround too 4 days and I was able to pick it up. I am very happy with the service here and would definitely recommend you go here! Gracias por un muy bien trabajo. Thank you for a job well done~< /review>

Was having logic board problems which affected my WiFi connectivity and Jose fixed it for me within 48 hours for the best price I could find in town. Really appreciate the customer service, professionalism, and timeliness. Thank you Jose!<//Review>

Awesome place to come get your phone fixed. I lived not far from this place and it had awesome reviews so I came here to get my logic board replaced on my iPhone 7 Plus. It works awesome. Jose is very honest with the price and fixing products. I called about 5 times while it was being fixed and he was very patient with me. I recommend this place to anyone if you want to get something fixed at a very affordable price.</text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>If I could give this business -3 stars, I would. I took my laptop for a password reset and windows upgrade. When I dropped off the laptop I was asked to leave the charging cord as well and when I picked up the laptop, they told me they never ask for cord because they have their own. I insisted they have it and request to check security cameras to confirm and I was told the cord has not  a high value to make it worth the time to check cameras. I told the guy he has a bad tone when talking to the costumers but he didn’t care. Worst costumer service ever plus my cord literally stolen.
Also I took an iPhone 7 to get the charging port fixed. He told me it needed a chip and that he was going to order it. I waited quite a long time. Finally he told me the chip didn’t work so I decide to give him extra time to look deeper into the issue. After what I experienced with my laptop, I decided to ask for my iPhone back. He told me he need to look for the part locally and not from China. That basically told me he never got the chip he previously told me about. Really bad service, and the guy has a really bad attitude. Just by looking at the place how not organized it is. Things all over. He even took a while to find my iPhone when I picked it up. He had a hard time finding it due to a bad organized working area. NOT RECOMMENDED ON ANY WAY. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

It's wholesome to know that there is a mom and pop store that has been there for years and has the personal touch we all want. I came to get a estimate on fixing a lamp and was told my options clearly. These guys want to help you and are honest with you; even if it means not making a sale. That goes along way.</Text>

Ned is a real PRO, through and through! I brought him a vintage item (high-end portable CD player), which was quite difficult to repair, and he got it to work (perfectly, I might add)! I will surely be back, and highly recommend his services! So, if you don't see Ned, your bugged-out electronics are sure to stay dead!<//Text>

My computer had been broken for over a year and I had originally planned on going to apple to have it repaired. When I went they were charging me 3X the price that I payed at Jose's. He managed to repair my computer in less than a week AND he fixed the real issue ( logic board). Jose genuinely cares about the repairs he does and ensures a 4 month guarantee if the same issue arises ( but he's confident you wont need those 4 months).  Great service overall!</review>

My MacBook Pro 2016 was functioning fine until one morning when it wouldn't turn on at all. I took it to Apple to repair and the price was $500 because they said that they needed to replace the entire logic board. So I decided to take it to BDJ and Jose was great! He said he could just repair the parts that were damaged and only for $250. He was very nice and careful, the MacBook is running great now and for sure when I have an issues with my electronics I'll take it to him.< /Review>

I took in an iphone x with a bad logic board, Jose told me it should be completed within 3 days. Within those 3 days I did not recieve a call or email, so I waited a week before I decided to call and ask if my device was ready. When I called Jose, he apologized and explained that he had a lot of work but that he already working on my device. Again I waited a week and still did not receive an email or call. I called again to ask about my device and he said that he had not started because he was waiting for some parts to arrive. I asked Jose when my phone will be ready and he angrily told me to be patient. I waited 4 days after that before calling him and still nothing. Finally I waited a month and decided to just pick up my device unrepaired.< /Text>

<Review>Brought my 8+ to the genius bar, they said the logic board was bad and they do not repair.  Offered to sell new one for $400 without my data and only ninety day warranty.  Jose fixed it in about five days (had to order parts) at around a 1/3 of the cost.  And got all my data back!  So far everything works great, but I have only been using it for several days.</Review>< rate>

Very Professional Person. He took my service for a remote data recovery and I was paid immediately after a successful recovery......For what ever I have interacted with him over internet, he has a state of the art lab when it comes to data recovery and other mac book/iphone repairs....... Now, I am sure if he is so particular to pay some body else for a quality job delivered to him, He surely would be some one who really gives out quality service to the local clients there...I must add, a person with a clean heart and dedication to his work/profession of fixing Macbook Logic Boards and Iphone...Highly Recommended.< /Text>

fixed my macbook pro screen right on the spot didn’t take more than 20 which was great. Took it again for other problem that and when he returned it it wasn’t fixed. but i took it back to him and he fixed it that same day.

Be patient with him and make sure he understands what the problem is. Jose is a great worker<//review>

Jose was very helpful and experienced. Since my Macbook pro got water damage and costed more than $1000 if I would have repaired it in any Apple store. The cost Jose offered me was acceptable and much lower than other places ( apple store or authorized 3rd-party fixing stores by Apple). Jose repaired it very fast - only taking 3 days. I highly recommend his place if you don't have enough budget to fix your devices.<//review>

I cannot recommend Jose enough - I don't know if I've ever received better service.  He's trustworthy, quick and communicative.  I spilled an entire cup of coffee on my MacBook Air and he fixed my computer within 24 hours at 1/4 of the cost Apple quoted me.   Do yourself a favor and use Jose and BDJ.</text>

<Text>I Googled "closest Mac repair to me" in KTown, and Jose's Google reviews showed promise. His location has PARKING and he gives a diagnosis instantly FREE of charge! Jose gave me simple hardware solutions at a fraction of what it would take to buy a whole new laptop,  and he still helps to handle all my software needs gratis. I even brought in my husband to see him for an issue he was quoted to be charged $200 just for the diagnoses, but Jose opened everything up and gave free instructions for my husband in under 10 minutes. My husband followed those steps and is blown away by Jose's helpfulness. We will both continue to visit Jose whenever we have Mac & Apple issues. He's super fast, helpful, honest and friendly.< /Text>< pics>

<text>BDJ MacBook logic board repair is the best iPhone repair store I ever went! The owner and iPhone mechanic Jose, is a professional and a hard worker. Jose can fix any issue you have whether it’s iPhone, iPad or Mac. A iPhone screen takes around 10-15mins to fix and thats fast! He’ll leave your phone look brand new. That’s why I recommend to check out this repair store and consult with Jose today! His pricing is affordable and fair. He’ll get the job done with no problem. 10/10 recommend!<//text>< Date>

<text>Went in to get my Macbook Pro's battery replaced, turns out it was just the logicboard needing replacing and cost me only $145. The whole thing took only a day and now works like a charm again! I also asked if he could help with my phone's cracked screen and he recommended I save money and just buy the part on ebay to do it myself since the model is so simple and yep turned out great. A+ customer service. :-)<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b863b26ad8e5:0x61c0d5bf3a12dc91<//Gmap_id>< Response>

Super quick turnaround and very friendly service! I had a logic board issue with my 2011 MacBook pro - it would turn on but screen would only show gray. I thought I needed the whole thing replaced but I dropped it off to Jose Friday afternoon and was able to pick up the repaired unit on Monday. Highly recommend!</review>

I'm super grateful for Jose at BDJ. I came in to get my macbook air fixed due to water damage and I was lucky enough to find that this place was still operating. Repair took a couple, weeks but it seems to work just as well as it did before the damage. Thank you again for being available!< /text>

<review>Called and talked to Jose, explained my issue with water damage and screen backlight not functioning on my 2015 MB Air. Everyone else I called advised complete replacement of the logic board at $400+ but Jose quoted less then half that. He also told me to let him know when I was coming in since I'd be driving from over an hour away and he would try to make the repair while I waited. I finally had the time the following week, called on my way and he started working on my laptop as soon as I arrived. Diagnosis was quick and accurate and repair was flawless. Price was the same as quoted. Professional service. Thanks!<//review>< gmap_id>

I tried changing the battery in my iPad Pro 9.7" and damaged the battery connector and a flex ribbon.  Jose saved my iPad from my own stupidity.  I brought the logic board in thinking I was going to have to drop it off and wait a few days to get it back.  Luckily he got to work right away and I even got to watch the microsoldering on the monitor (just like in all the YouTube tutorials).  The logic board was good as new in about 35-40 minutes.

My MAC stopped working after I drop water on it. After going to the Apple store and being quote $700 for the repair (on a computer that's worth not more than $400) I decided to Google for repair places. I was really lucky to find bdj and after reading the reviews I went in. Jose, was amazing, showed me what was damaged on a high tech magnifying device and told me he would change the parts for 1/4 of what apple had quoted me. He fixed my MAC in 2 days and it's now working amazingly! So happy I found this company and would highly recommend their services 🌟🌟</review>

My Macbook Pro was a Valentine's gift a couple of years back. It is very sentimental to me. It also had a hard drive issue. So he basely refurbished my own computer. Wonderful!  I just got it back today. I am so happy! Thank you Jose!  I recommend him 1000%.

He's the best! I've spilled water all over my MacBook Air recently, and when I went into an Apple repair shop they told me they couldn't repair it and that I just needed to buy a whole new MacBook! Then I did a bit of research and read about BDJ. The very next day I went and he repaired my MacBook in ONE day. Thank you!</Review>

I sent my laptop in March 25th, 2019...9 months ago and haven’t got a single call, message, email, or package from them. A simple logic board fix was the problem. I’ve called over 50 times and every time he says “I’ll check it out, I don’t know why they haven’t sent it to you” or “I see we still have it let me find out on that, call me in a day, a few days, a week” I’ve heard them all. Also, the two guys have bounced me back and forth telling to call the other guy he can help. I would absolutely, under no circumstances send your laptop to this company. If you live in LA maybe because you can confront them in person but if you have to mail it in ABSOLUTELY NOT! Scam Scam Scam</Review>

I dropped my iPhone X and the screen wasn't cracked but it was glitching and flickering solid green. He was able to fix this in a matter of 15 minutes by replacing my screen. He was professional and charged far less than anywhere else I looked.< /review>

My daughter had her Macbook Pro in her backpack and a bottle of shampoo opened. The shampoo got into the inside of her Macbook. Nobody in town was willing to work on it. They claimed it was beyond repair. The Apple store quoted me $1400 to replace the logic board. Jose at BDJ opened the Macbook, ran a couple of test, and said it's still good but I will need to replace some parts. He worked on it and got it working again. The cost for all the repairs was $300 and it took a week to get it back. They have great customer service. I highly recommend BDJ Macbook Logic Board Repair for your computer repairs.</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Completely saved my computer! Can’t give this a high enough review! I have a 2012 MacBook Pro Retina. Last week the display started cutting in and out, a few days later it was completely gone. Computer would boot, but would have no display at all. I googled and found that this year MacBook had a known recall on the issue. I called Apple and the computer was out of warranty basically leaving me the only option of a $750+ logic board replacement on a computer worth maybe $1,000.

I was bumming hard until I found BDJ and Jose! I originally saw the service on eBay then realized it was 3 miles from my house. I looked it up on google and saw a ton of positive reviews so figured it was worth a shot. Sure enough my mans came through! Total time from drop off to repair was one week and the computer is PERFECT! On top of the logic board repair ($150) he also replaced my battery for $85. So now $235 I have a computer good as new again.

Can’t recommend him highly enough! Super kind dude who is down to fix anything. Also so nice that he has a storefront that you can come into for pickup and drop offs instead of having to ship it out. Go here. I promise it’s worth it!<//review>< Pics>

I am so impressed!  My Mac Book Air had water damage, wouldn't turn on. I didn't even want to know how much it would cost to fix.  I am so glad I found this place.  I requested a quote, took it in the next day and had my computer back in 24 hours.  It was so easy!  His prices are great and he is very knowledgeable.</review>

Went over last Thursday  to get my laptop fixed. I spilled some tea on my laptop and they fixed it by replacing the keyboard. I picked up my laptop the next day and works the way it did before. I really appreciate the low cost solution and fast repair  they offered. In addition to that hablan espanol. Highly recommend!<//Text>

I am an IT professional and I can vouch that JOSE knows his stuff. He repaired my water (Coke) damaged 2017 Powerbook for 1/3 the cost of the Apple Store. The
reasonable price he charged was standard rates for hours worked and parts used. The amount Apple quoted was highway robbery. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!< /text>

I was recommended to go to BDJ by the Apple Doc on Adams after I accidentally spilled fabric softener on one side of my Macbook Pro. Luckily, Jose was there to help. He repaired the logic board to avoid the heavy cost of replacing it completely and he did a really fantastic job. He also replaced my screen and fixed a subsequent internal speaker issue.  All this to say, the man is a professional--extremely apt in his craft and unspeakably patient with me. My Macbook seems to be running better than ever and all in a few days' time. Highly recommend.</Text>

I am so grateful that I found Jose at Bdj Macbook Logic Board Repair!
What a relief to know there is an honest, reliable and skilled Mac repair shop here in Los Angeles. My Macbook Air was quickly repaired within a few days at a very reasonable price and works like a charm again! Thank you so much Jose! I will be telling all my friends about Bdj Macbook Logic Board Repair.< /Review>

My defective charger shorted something out that my Macbook Pro battery stopped charging. Apple store told me I had to replace the right I/O board, did that but didn't fix the problem. Another computer repair shop told me they couldn't fix it and I would have to replace the logic board that would cost me $750. Luckily I found Jose at BDJ computer repair, the guy knows what he is doing and fixed my laptop ... the battery charges now ... for $225. Next time skip the Apple store and (don't try to DIY, I damaged a few connecting cables changing the I/O board ...Jose fixed them too). Go directly to BDJ ... highly recommended.</review>

<Review>I had water damage on my MacBook Pro and I went to a different shop before BDJ. They charged me 100$ just to run diagnostics then wanted 600$ to replace my logic board and not even save any of my data. BDJ only charged me 300$ to completely recover all my data and fix the logic board I already had. He did it in 3 days and he was very nice. He gave me a text when it was ready and it was all a very quick and easy process. Computer works great now!< /Review>< resp>

My macbook from 2011 went through hell and back and I was debating getting a whole new laptop but when I brought it in, it took a couple days and I have a laptop the runs much faster now. He threw in a good cleaning also which helped a lot and it was much more affordable than even buying a tablet. Well worth the wait and price!!<//Review>

I was in desperate need of getting my IC audio chip replaced bc I’m leaving the state and couldn’t make a phone call!! They helped me as a WALK IN (unheard of in LA to be honest) and fixed my phone within 3 hours!!!! No send out necessary!! Quick. Efficient. Competitive price! Kind! Knowledgeable staff and my phone works PERFECTLY!!! The best money I’ve spent all year!!! Had me up and running in no time!! I love these guys!!</Text>

<Text>Amazing service! I was originally quoted $800 for a repair on my Macbook at another location. They couldn't fix it for less than that because of liquid damage. However, after taking it to the BDJ Computer repair center, the price was cut in half because liquid damage wasn't even the issue. He correctly identified my issue and saved me money! On top of that, the issue was resolved in less than 15 minutes!! Will definitely keep this place on speed dial!<//Text>< Pictures>

I came to Jose in hopes of getting my 17” Mac Book Pro back up and running after a software update that left my Mac with the GREY SCREEN OF DEATH. I looked up the issue and it all came down to. Logic Board repair. I contacted several companies to get it fixed but I was told they’d have to replace my logic board which is expensive. I heave been without my Mac for about 4 months until I came across Jose at BDJ Computers. Jose confirmed it was a logic board issue but said most likely a graphics card issue. He told me he’d only replace the graphics card and not the entire board. Needless to say, Jose worked his magic, replaced the graphics card, booted my Mac up in front of me, shut it down, rebooted and it works just perfectly. Thank you Jose. Go see him, you won’t be disappointed. Don’t worry about where is shop is located, he will get your Mac back up and working.<//Text>

<text>Go see Jose, don’t mess around trying to fix yourself.i spilled coffee directly on my MacBook Pro waited a few days Tried everything I read on the internet. Found these guys got down there. I thought they would change out the logic card out as my MAc would not even power up.

Jose opened it up got it on his telescope, 20 minutes later my machine was working perfectly.

Canceled the order for a new machine I placed😀<//text>< Pictures>

Crazy fast turn around.

2 day turn around for a microsolder repair is really impressive. If you aren’t aware of the service they provide let me explain;

Microsoldering is a very difficult skill. It’s also a dying industry which makes finding someone with skill difficult. BDJ has advanced electronic comprehension - reading board schematics is difficult and sometimes impossible since it’s proprietary information companies don’t provide. They back this knowledge and expertise with the actual delicate skill of performing board repairs using a huge magnifying glass and very precise skill using precision instruments. The equipment alone to do this cost $5000+

So thanks again BDJ!<//text>

Kept delaying my iPhone repair saying "It'll be done by tomorrow" taking 3 days in total for them to identify the problem just for them to eventually just say my iPhone is un-fixable (Even though I had my iPhone issue identified by a professional before I came here) The repairman was giving me an attitude too... I went to another repair shop that repaired my iPhone within a day!< /text>

<Name>Josh Gonzalez< /Name><text>Dropped off my MacBook Pro weeks ago for water repair.
Picked it up 3 days after originally bringing it in.

Paid the quoted 200 bucks for logic board “repair” (thought I heard him say replacement on the phone).

Paid $45 for a new batter which was said that I needed.

Had it for two days, working okay, then it suddenly would not turn on at all. No signs of life.

Took it back to Jose. He said it was something to do with tape. Been waiting 5 days, no updates on my MacBook.

Want to give a good rating and will edit after getting my computer back for the second time.

EDIT 12/2/19: updated to 4 stars because Jose did get my computer back, initially, very quickly. However, not giving 5 because I am still waiting on my MacBook to be repaired fully, as I had some issues with it after getting it back the first time.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b863b26ad8e5:0x61c0d5bf3a12dc91</Gmap_id>< Time>

<review>I had an issue with my logic board on an almost brand new 2017 MacBook Pro. Basically it would no longer turn on. First, I decided to take it to an authorized Apple repair shop  first. They charged me an $80 diagnostic fee, but two days later still couldn't tell me what was wrong with it. Then they said that for $800, they could fix whatever the problem was, which is strange considering they didn't know what the problem was. Essentially what they do is just replace your whole logic board. Yeah that's going to be a big nope from me. After a quick Google search, I found BDJ. I took it there the next day. Within 2-3 hours, they figured out what the problem was. Turned out it was a tiny chip on the logic board that needed to be replaced. They ordered the part, installed it, and now my MacBook is back up and running like new. The only downside was that it took a few weeks for the part to come in since it wasn't in stock and had to be shipped from overseas, but it was well worth the wait and cost a fraction of what Apple wanted to charge me. Seriously, don't go to Apple if you have hardware issues and don't have Apple Care. I'd highly recommend these guys.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1563408765764, 'text': 'Thanks'}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Excellent work. My 15inch MacBook Pro had water spilt on it and I had left it for a few days without using it. On the third day I took the laptop to BDJ and they opened the bottom case and showed me the modules which were getting corroded with a magnifying camera.

Apple would replace any part that comes in contact with water but at BDJ they only replace the modules that are going to stop working. Their quotation was much more affordable and I highly recommend going to BDJ for their services.< /Review>

I ran all around LA before finding Jose was one of the few people who actually repairs the computer and doesn’t make you buy a new part as most places do. This in return creates a cost efficient process. I would highly recommend BDJ and all of their services. Thanks for bringing my computer back to life!!!< /Text>< Pics>

<review>Jose is amazing! I was in town for a conference and my new (and very expensive) Macbook Pro laptop got liquid damage from a bottle of Coca-Cola, of all things. Within 24 hours, Jose popped it open, replaced the damaged parts of my logic board, and handed me back a working laptop before I got on my plane. It only cost me a few hundred dollars, when replacing the logic board would've cost over a thousand. Jose is a wizard and I'm so grateful!< /review><response>{'time': 1562781594582, 'text': 'Thanks'}</response>< Rating>

<text>Went in because I literally dropped a whole cup on hot coffee onto my mac, smh. I went in to have Jose look at it and he said for a fact he can fix it for a fair price , which was a huge relief. He completed the repair the next day and everything worked fine.

<review>Saved my life!! I’m a college student and when Apple quoted me $800 and 10 day repair time for my water damaged MacBook Pro I almost fainted on the spot. But BDJ came to the rescue and charged me a fraction of the price and had my computer ready just in time for class the NEXT DAY!!!! He is super knowledgeable and very communicative along the way. Will definitely recommend to friends and family!<//review>< pictures>

He not only provides the great service, but also provides the high-quality repair. My MacBook Pro got very bad water damage. I went to few repair shops in OC, couldn’t get it fixed. Jose used his experienced technical skill to fix all the issues, from broken components to logic board. He did a fantastic job. He also did quality check over hours & hours to make sure the laptop works fine. I am very happy with Jose’s service quality.  I highly recommend his excellent repair service. BDJ is the best place in Southern  California  to have your Mac repaired.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1561315211238, 'text': 'Thanks'}<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2b863b26ad8e5:0x61c0d5bf3a12dc91<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>TL:DR Jose is kind, quick, and most importantly a professional. I will be taking my computer back for future repairs

************************************************************************

I work in I.T.

Last month, my 1st edition Macbook pro retina (2013 )kept shutting off and required repair to the motherboard.

I hadn't been in the shop for 5 minutes before Jose had diagnosed my issue and assured me he would have it fixed and ready to go in 2 days time.

He called me before noon the next day stating that it was repaired and I could come pick it up.

I'm very picky as to which business I review and I wanted to wait some time before writing this one so I could verify the repair was succesful.

After a month, not only is my computer up and running, but it appears to run better now that it doesn't overheat as quickly as before.

This guy knows his stuff</Text>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Awesome experience!  My macbook air stopped working while in Europe--could not charge or anything.  Apple genius bar and mac repair place in santa barbara both wanted $500+ to send off to repair logic board (?) and no assurances on the data.  I found BDJ online.  From walking in the door to finding the short and repairing was literally under 10 mins!  he showed me the tiny piece of metal and replaced a little circuit (i believe).  paying the $225 literally took longer than the repair.  Great work Jose!  highly recommend these guys to anyone who doesn't want to get ripped off by Apple norms.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>I called all the places near me at about. 10mile radius. He offered the most reasonable price. So I came. Initially, he told me that it would have to wait a full day for me to pick up my broken console,but once I got there, he looked at it and told me that the problem wouldn't take that long and that he could get it done in half an hour. Amazing. First of all, he offered his services at a much more reasonable price than his competitors, and on top of that, I unexpectedly got a "day of" service. No extra fee. Highly recommend this place. Jose was extremely friendly and accommodating.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Date>

These guys rock..
I sent my laptop to them and had it back within a week, and I live about 500 miles away. Customer service was great and I was always able to get someone on the phone when I had questions, and  they were very knowledgeable and fixed a problem that apple couldn’t even fix. I recommend these guys 100%<//Review>

I spilled an entire cup of soda on my Macbook air and damaged the logic board.  After taking it to several repair locations that told me they would be unable to fix it, I took it to bdj and was immediately assured that they would be able to perform the repair.  You may have to wait a few weeks for parts to arrive, but the result is completely worth it.  The owner is genial and welcoming, the price of the repair is absolutely unbeatable, and my laptop is now working perfectly.</text>

<review>Jose is the man! I initially took my Mid-2014 15' MBP to him for a battery and a screen repair. While on a music tour, the battery had failed. I'm puzzled and called Jose and expressed to him the issue. He said bring it in when you return. I brought it back to him and took excellent care of me and swapped out the battery for another new one! On tour again, my battery failed me and said it needed to be replaced. I called Jose and he was still willing to figure out what's going on. Keep in mind, he's been patient with me this entire time! I took my laptop to him and said "my friend, I need to really diagnose what's wrong with your computer, because two dead batteries in less than 6 months is unusual! I said okay, you're the doctor, it's in your hands. Two days after dropping it off,  he called me and said there's a very small component on the logic board that needs to be replaced. The picture attached is what was causing my laptop to fail and Jose fixed it and told me to unplug my laptop when it's fully charged. So my knowledge to you is; Trust Jose and BDJ. Unplug you laptop when the battery is full.. and recommend Jose to your friends, family and colleagues. Thanks for everything! I will always come back!

<text>I can not say enough great things about Jose and BDJ Computer Repair! This review is coming after my second time patronizing this business, so clearly I stand by their work. I was referred her by a friend over a year ago to replace my keyboard after my puppy chewed off a couple of keys. Jose ordered the parts and completed the work within a few days. My second visit here had a 24hr turnaround! My backlight wasn't working properly, and Jose fixed the mother board seemingly effortlessly. I am in the middle of writing my final graduate project research paper, and have NO time for my laptop to be broken. Jose called me at 10:20am for a 3pm pick up! I am so thankful and will refer all my friends here in the future.<//text><gmapID>0x80c2b863b26ad8e5:0x61c0d5bf3a12dc91<//gmapID>< time>

Unbelievable service! 5 star is an understatement! Apple was charging me almost a thousand dollars to repair! While Jose charges a fraction of apple with services under warranty! Highly recommend!</review>

I broke my flash drive and was told by others that the data was lost and could not be recovered. I had saved pictures, music, original compositions and tax information on this flash drive. I took the flash drive to BDJ repair. Jose checked it out and was able to recover ALL of my information. He is truly a life saver and I will definitely recommend him to others!!</review>

Great quality work with fast turnaround and great prices. For all you Apple fans out there... I recommend you skip the Apple store ($$$) completely, or go there first...then come see BDJ so you can appreciate his quality of work and great real world prices.  He'll also tell you if he CANT fix things= very honest!</Text>

Fast and friendly Service. I came in with a computer that didn't turn on and they had it diagnosed as bad RAM and had it running in just a few minutes.  Prices were more than reasonable and the repair guy didn't try to up sell me on extra RAM.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.<//Review>

My Macbook Pro was not turning on. I brought it to Jose on a Monday afternoon and he said it will take about 4 days to fix the motherboard. He called me the next morning and said it was ready for pick-up!!! Better yet, his price was HALF of what Apple quoted me. Please check this place out, you won't be disappointed!</text>

<Text>Terrific! I had my work completed for $300, for the repair of my MacBook Pro - bad water damage - dropped a green juice into the keyboard and left it overnight - didn’t notice it had happened. Before coming to this shop, I’d been quoted between $1800 and $2000 from 3 other companies (all authorised apple repair work telling me I needed tier 4 repair). One other company told me it couldn’t be repaired. BDJ Mackbook, this company, took it in and had it ready within 48 hours. Great guy, great job. So happy.< /Text><Date>1565101325081<//Date><Rate>5<//Rate>< resp>

<text>Jose is best! Very trustable and experienced, I would 100% recommend taking your device to his workshop. A little piece from my motherboard broke and it needed micro soldering, Apple didn't want to fix it, they wanted me to buy a new motherboard. I brought my laptop to Jose and he return it working PERFECTLY! Thank you so much, I will definitely come back if anything fails on my computer.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Wonderful service. Best laptop repair experience ever, without a doubt. Based on past laptop failures, feared my 2012 MacBook Pro would require a new logic board after the screen stopped turning on. BDJ diagnosed the faulty logic board chip and repaired it in only a couple days. Not only did BDJ have the necessary technical knowledge and skill, they had the genuine wholesomeness that I look for with every service transaction. Very reasonably priced too!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>So my macBook had no chime, no sound, no output device showing in preferences. I was looking at a few hundred $ for a logic board etc.
Jose showed me the part that was fried on the board, which he repaired.
I paid a fraction of what Apple and another mail-in service wanted. For actual board repairs (not replacement) he's the real deal.</Review>< gmap_id>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>A staple computer repair in our community! I was referred here by the Mac Repair shop at USC. José was SOOO helpful. He told me that he would have to look over my logicboard and find the issue, then repair and it could take 3-5 days. The day was monday: I was a bit hurt because I leave out of town wednesday and really needed it. He messaged me back today (tuesday) at 12pm and told me to come pick up my computer!

This is not even to mention the great pricing. The apple store wanted to charge me $150 just for a diagnostic that would've taken 3 days. This place cost me less than $200 for full service. What a love. I'm so thankful and will refer all my friends to his shop if they have issues with their electronics.

thank you again José!<//review><rate>5< /rate><userid>116490909987105872406< /userid>< response>

<review>Great service from BDJ. I brought my IPhone 7 to Jose at BDJ which had a greyed out speaker. Jose was able to repair the broken speaker in 24 hrs. Apple Store wanted $350 to replace my phone out of warranty but Jose was able to repair it for much cheaper. Highly recommend BDJ!</review>< pictures>

I had a great experience with BDJ Repair. I spilled water on my MacBook Pro keyboard and the laptop stopped powering on. I know my way around computers — I can take my MacBook apart and replace the keyboard, for example—but a logic board repair is beyond what I can do. I researched online and based on reviews, price, and the info on the BDJ website I chose to come here, even though I am in southern Orange County and the shop is an hour away. I was impressed that BDJ does all of their own work in house, including very technical BGA reballing soldering. That indicated a certain level of expertise.

When I walked in on Monday they initially said it would be ready on Thursday. They are a busy shop and I could see how many machines they had to work on. I was leaving the country and asked for an expedited delivery time. They said no promises, but would have it down on Wednesday afternoon, "maybe" Tuesday night. However, on Tuesday morning I already had a response that the laptop was ready. W O W.

Also, want to mention that their prices are very reasonable. For example, most shops for my model of MacBook Pro would charge $200-$250 for a keyboard replacement. At BDJ it's $100-$115. The Logic Board repair was $235 — again, very reasonable for a technical component level repair.

Highly recommend BDJ Repair!< /review>

I went to Jose out of last minute desperation. I was leaving town in two days when my laptop wouldn't turn on. Unluckily, my phone went haywire too so I was using a temp, old phone. No Yelp. I googled the closet phone repair shop to me and this place had pretty decent reviews.
I went in and Jose put the laptop to his ear and said I had a hard drive issue. He replaced it for $150. I told him my friend would be by to pick it up when he told me when it would be ready. He legit tells me to make sure my friend has the money when picking it up...
Needless to say, the problems came back within a week. It kept crashing. Kernel panics. I took it elsewhere for a diagnostic where they found it was a logic board issue. Jose didn't even run a diagnostic. I called to have it looked at again since it was under warranty. Upon dropping it off I told him, call me before you do any work on it and if it's a hard drive issue, let me know so I can replace it with a SSD instead. Also, it isn't backed up!! I wasn't able to back it up because it wasn't able to get past the startup screen. It would go black and shut down at any attempt to start it. He said he would run a diagnostic and call me the next day.
The next day comes. No call. I call him instead at the end of the workday. He tells me he's still running a diagnostic and would call me tomorrow. Same thing the next day. I call him and he tells me that it was my hard drive and he's now replacing it with another one of his hard drives. He says he's backing it up. Now, he clearly disregarded everything I requested when dropping it off. He didn't call me to let me know what he found or even ask me what I wanted to do after being informed of the results. We get into an arguement. I just ask him (again) to let me know when it is ready. He tells me 2 days.
Two days later. Nothing. I call again and this time he tells me that he will let me know when it is ready. Memorial Day weekend comes and goes. He calls the following day and tells me that it isn't the hard drive but instead it's my memory. I tell him that I will be in later to pick up my laptop. Before hanging up, I ask if he is certain everything is backed up. He says yes. Everything.
I go and pick it up. Leave, come home, and after a long day, try to start it up. It boots but guess what? Not everything is backed up!!! Missing applications, downloads, music, recorded songs, everything since the last backup I did about a month ago!!!! So so SO very disappointed. I specifically asked him not to do anything without asking me first. Will not be going back. Ever. Will not recommend. Ever.
Found a solid guy to take a look at it who runs a very reputable business.
The whole experience has been a terrible one. Do not go here. Ever.</Text><userid>117314107899977676720<//userid>< Gmap_id>

BDJ Computer is quick, reliable, repair for all your tablets, laptops, TVs, printers, and any apple products. Cheaper and faster then fixing it at any computer repair place or Best Buy which can take u weeks for estimate. All estimates are free owner Jose is excellent.

<review>After a month of research, I knew the issue with my 15" MBPr 2012 was the GPU soldering and needed someone to do component level repair.  The price of a logic board swap was completely out of the question for such an old laptop.

I couldn't find anyone locally in Orange County so I searched via google for techs in LA.  After one phone call with Jose, I knew he was the guy for the job.  He guarantees his work for quite some time after repairs and also came in a bit cheaper than the competition for grade A work.  A couple days later my MBPr was ready for work again.  I WILL DEFINITELY RETURN FOR MORE REPAIRS!!!</review><user_id>110439604602736642963< /user_id><rating>5<//rating><Gmap_id>0x80c2b863b26ad8e5:0x61c0d5bf3a12dc91</Gmap_id><name>Vince Phung< /name><Time>1552715913641</Time></record></dataset><record>

I’m so delighted to get my computer fixed in less than a day! It was a logic board issue, water damage, and other places couldn’t fix it and Jose did it in less than a day!!! He’s the magic!! I would give 10 stars if I can! I highly recommend their service!!< /review>

<Review>Honest, fast, and affordable repairs for all your electronic needs. Fixed my MacBook that had been rained on. Was able to repair everything and salvage all my data. Brought it back from the dead!
Also fixed my girlfriend’s  iPhone, that had been run over by a car, in a few minutes.

Very professional, knowedgeable, and friendly.
Highly recommend!< /Review>< Pics>

Great service, up front prices, very fast turn around. Had to get a Logic Board
repaired and new keyboard. Best price around after checking with four other
shops. Service was done faster than quoted time...will return for all computer
repairs. Jose was very friendly thanks again< /review>

My iPhone 6 needed repair. Touch IC chip needed replacement. Jose fixed it and it was ready the next day. This was a very technical repair that not all shops can perform. Best part was the price was fair. Now I know where to go for smart phone repair.< /Text>

He recognized the Graphics Card problem immediately, said he could fix it, gave me a reasonable price and had it ready in exactly the time he quoted.

Jose is very professional and gives great customers service. My brother has used him in the past and has gotten great results. So I felt good going to him to get my Macbook Pro services for a graphics video card. I had asked if he can have it ready within a few days since I had a dj gig. I highly recommend him A+++ in my books.< /review>

I found the ad that BDJ replaces Macbook lcd in 20 minutes and Jose does a really good job. Jose replaced my screen in less than 20 minutes and the price is cheaper than other shops.

<Text>This shop is gold!
The only problem I had was the timing. It took about 6 weeks and that was only because my computer is extremely outdated Mac from 2010.
He was able to save all of my information, fix all the issues with my computer, and I received a charger and HDMI adaptor for my iPhone. Included for under 250 bucks. Great service! I will definitely come back if I have any issues in the future!< /Text>< gmapID>

These guys are the the real deal! I had spilled coffee on my Macbook air and subsequently, the backlight on the screen did not work. I took it to multiple computer repair stores locally and even to Apple where they all said it required me to replace the entire logic board, costing me upwards of $500. I found BDJ Computer Repair and after communicating with the owner, I decided to take a leap of faith and ship them my laptop. Load and behold, my laptop returned FIXED 1-2 weeks later, for just over $100. I would recommend this place 10/10 times.<//text>

<Review>I had a graphics card fail on my MacBook Pro. The Apple Store quoted me over $700 and said I needed to replace the entire logic board. I was pretty sure that meant my computer was totaled sine it is a 2011 and not worth the $. I found BDJ online and took it over. They were super helpful and fast and they replaced just the graphics card for $200. Saved my mac! Great customer service. They even installed a new hard drive I purchased for free when doing the graphics card work. I'll go here first with any apple product repairs I need in the future.

<Text>Water spilt on MacBook

I split water on my MacBook Pro, after taking it to apple and being told it's going to cost over $800 to repair it, because they replace the entire insides. I did some google searching and found BDJ computers, unsure of the website I called and he told me what I needed to do. so I boxed it up and shipped it off.

After a week or so called to check on the status and he informed me of the problem ( needs a chip on the motherboard ) and he was awaiting parts, and he was very convinced that he could repair it 100%. I again called in a week to do a simple checkup and told me it was in pre shipping testing and would ship out the next day. within 24 hrs I received the tracking info and 2 days later I received my MacBook.  I booted it up and tested everything to make sure it's working as it should and sure enough everything works just perfect. I'm very happy with the service and will be refering everyone I know to him, though it took a little bit of time the end result if well worth the wait..

Thank you again for the great service.. Anthony</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b863b26ad8e5:0x61c0d5bf3a12dc91< /Gmap_id><username>Mr Tony<//username>< user>

I work for Disney and am in the IT field.  When my girlfriend spilled a glass of water on her Macbook Air, I had little time to invest in repairing it myself.  I found Jose on here, and visited his shop.  Having owned my own computer repair company a few years ago, I instantly recognized his shop as the workings of a man who loves what he does.

Jose replaced the logic board on the Macbook Air in less that 24 hours for an incredible price.  He was professional, technical, and more importantly - trustworthy.

I would highly recommend his services to anyone.</text>

<text>I took my 2012 macbook pro to apple store and they yold me it was my video card and that i should just buy a new one because my laptop was vintage. Wow i said i dont have an extra 3k for a new one. So i took it to BDJ computer Repair and he fixed it for $200 and had friendly service. Now thats what i call a big win and if i would have listend to those Apple geniuses like a lot of people do my wallet would be a lot lighter. I hope this helps some one.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Text>Referred to Jose mid-afternoon, called him with the Samsung Galaxy S4 problem, told me to come in at 4 PM this day, on entering his busy shop he looked at the Galaxy, used meters to check out the opened phone, proceeded to work on the phone  with gauged soldering equipment under  microscope to fix the problem - in a total of 30 minutes completed his repair,  plugged battery into phone demonstrating how well phone is working. A rare find to locate great service, fast, knowledgeable, capable to electronically measure equipment operation, very reasonably priced providing service with courtesy, a smile and great full for your business.Very highly recommended 5 stars plus. Thanks Jose, your are appreciated,< /Text>< pictures>

Alienware m18x R2 that had the 8 beeps no post.  Jose diagnosed the problem and put in a new screen on what I thought was a dead computer.    Knowledgeable, helpful and fast.  I'm from the midwest and I'll use BDJ from here on out for any electronics issues.<//text>

Came here and right away felt good about leaving my MacBook pro for repair. My mac was having issues picking up wifi. Everything was noted to me upfront, price, needed repair, and estimated time which was super fast!

Really happy to have my mac back and fully functionally! Definitely my go to place for electronic repairs now!!<//review>

Had a problem with my macbook audio. felt devastated, all my research on the problem couldn't fix it. sent it to mac genius bar and they wanted to replace my whole logic board with a charge well over what i can afford. Sent it here to bdj computer and with a price significantly less than apple, homie fixed it in 3 days. this type of service is rare. he knows what he's doing, and can probably do anything. 10/10< /text>

They did an excellent job fixing my MacBook Pro with water damage. It was done well and quite in expensively. They were honest about issues they could have charged me for but weren't necessary to repair. They also helped me fix my iphone 5 phone. I recommend.<//review>

<username>Bernie Tusko</username><review>I have a MacBook Air that had a drink spilled on the keyboard, resulting in the usual water damage meltdown.

I had an important conference to attend and needed a laptop... had to decide whether to repair this one or buy another.

I took it to 3 other places, and all gave me a similar answer... They either couldn't fix it, or they couldn't fix it without replacing so many parts that it would be ridiculously expensive, and that's before we added the labor charge to do the required work.

So I came across BDJ and decided to make one more call.

I told him the issue and he made it sound like this type of repair is everyday routine for him.

So I decided to give this computer one last shot at life, and sent it in.

He received the computer and was able to get it on the bench within a few days and diagnose it.

He told me what the issues were, quoted a very reasonable price, and had it finished and working better than ever within a day!

I'm super glad I found BDJ!< /review><GmapID>0x80c2b863b26ad8e5:0x61c0d5bf3a12dc91</GmapID>< UserId.>

I was referred to BDJ Computer Repair by my cousin who just had his iPhone touch screen repaired--which works great. My MacBook Pro LCD screen backlight didn't work. I was ready to throw in the towel on my laptop after taking it to a few shops and being told that it couldn't be fixed. I was skeptical that Jose could fix it but after looking at it, he knew what was the issue and fixed it. I was very satisfied with the level of service and would definitively go back for all my computer/mobile needs.<//Text>

My experience at bdj computer repair was the best repair experience I ever had.  And this is coming from a guy with certificates in computer servicing; network Telecom, and electronics to go with my three degrees, one in electronic technology.  If you are reading this, this is the place you want all your work done for several reasons. One: He gets the job done in an effective and efficient manner, and on time.  Two: He has an amicable personality that helps you understand the problems you have with your computer or other electronic device. He will break things down for you to understand. Three: He does not charge you to diagnose the problem. Four: He does not over charge you like many people do. His prices are less then most people that have less knowledge. Five: he can handle the most complex jobs, including efi locks. Five: some of the best technicians come to him to get certain things done. While I was waiting on him, I observed a guy picking something up from him in his work area. A guy told me that the guy picking something up has his own computer shop, but everybody with shops comes to him to get things done they can’t do, or don’t have the equipment to do.  He saved me hundreds of dollars.  THIS GUY IS THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS WITH THE BEST PRICES. I PROMISE, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My MacBook Pro 2011 had graphics issues then one morning it just crapped out. I’ve gone though this problem before. It is a known design flaw with this model but Apple’s repair quote was extremely high. I found BDJ online and they were very professional and reassuring. Their quote was a fraction of Apple’s. Now have my baby back like new and a  repair guy for the next Macaggedon. I can’t recommend these guys enough. Small business like this should be supported, they treat you like an individual and provide excellent value. Thanks BDJ Computer Repair!< /Review>

Woke up around 8am and my computer would not turn on. I found it really weird for it to suddenly not work after using it the night before. I called apple and schedule an appointment for about 4pm but NEEDED to get my laptop fixed ASAP .

Called the store before arriving and was informed about receiving a free diagnostic on computer.
I arrive at the store and hand the guy my laptop. He asks me what happen and I tell him again exactly what i wrote above.
He opens it, takes it to the back for about 1 minute and come back just to tell me "Youre computer is messed up but i can fix it for $250." I say " i dont have the money right now, no thank you. Ill just go somewhere else."
He says "okay Ill go it for $195 ."
I leave the store, take it to APPLE and they tell me " The battery was literally dead. We took it out, charged it. You are good to go!"

This guy is A COMPLETE FRAUD. HUSTLER. and many other things.

He will take advantage of the necessity to get a valuable device fixed.</review>

<Review>I came into BDJ after having wifi issues on my MacBook Pro for years. Apple was not interested in helping me and wanted to charge an outrageous amount without even knowing what the problem was. I met Jose on a busy Saturday morning with needing my repairs done immediately. He understood my situation, took a quick look at my laptop and fixed the problem in under an hour! The pricing was more than fair and I haven't any problems sense. If you ever need a laptop repair done quickly, efficiently and cost effective, come to BDJ and have Jose check you out before you waste your time at the "Genius" bar.< /Review><Response>None< /Response><UserId.>102899541421161706510</UserId.><username>Ray Bayu</username>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>THIS PLACE ROCKS.

I accidently drowned a Macbook Pro on a beach in Puerto Rico and wrote it off, smashed up the hard drive and forked over for a new computer.  When my son's computer suffered the same fate less than a year later, I felt cursed.  I asked him look for used computers on Craigslist and he sent me the link to this place.  Everything about it seemed sketchy but intriguing.  We had nothing to lose.  Not only did they fix it quickly and cheaply (making me regret surrendering my last laptop so quickly) they did so competently and with such warmth and friendliness I hardly believed I was in an electronics repair shop.

ALL YE WHO HAVE ABANDONED HOPE!  Enter here... They can rescue you and your device.  What a Godsend this place is... Thank you, Jose!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>When I was growing up, in the 1960s, if the family television began to act up my father would remove the tubes, take them down to the drugstore, diagnose the bad tube and replace it.  Component level repair was the norm.  Sometime during the 70's or 80's  we as a nation seemed to collectively forget  how to repair our products at the component level and, with computers in particular, when a component fails (e.g. a surface mounted IC), we toss out the entire board and replace it --- throwing away hundreds of working components.  This is wasteful, costly, lazy and stupid.

Jose at BDJ is a talented technician who diagnoses which component on a board has failed and uses special manufacturing tools (surface mount IC) to replace just the component.  A repair to my system board that would have cost $750 anywhere else, cost just $200 here.  It was completed in two work days with a smile and not a promise broken.

Go to BDJ, not just to save a few hundred bucks (you will), but to help save the environment from excessive waste and help save the country from stupidity.  Thanks Jose!<//Review><response>None<//response><time>1445992967064</time><Rate>5<//Rate><pics>None< /pics><user_id>108091348874460777585< /user_id><gmap_id>0x80c2b863b26ad8e5:0x61c0d5bf3a12dc91<//gmap_id></record>

(Translated by Google) TERRIBLE SERVICE !!!! I recommend that if they take something to repair that they do in writing that they are leaving the email because later they say that they did not leave anything or do not find it, when one complains they get very bad attitude "" "VERY BELOW THE COSTUMER SERVICES" " "I waited for almost 2 and a half weeks so that in the end nothing would solve me, on the contrary, I lost because the charger was STOLEN, the charger does not cost anything, I know, but the irresponsibility of the local when saying that it does not have it is what I did not like .......... I DO NOT EAT ANYONE THIS PLACE 👎👎👎👎👎👎

(Original)
PESIMO SERVICIO !!!! Recomiendo que si llevan algo a reparar que hagan por escrito que le están dejando el electronico porque después dice que no dejaron nada o no lo encuentra, cuando uno le reclama se pone de muy mala actitud """MUY POR DEBAJO EL  COSTUMER SERVICES"""  yo espere casi 2 semanas y media para que al final no me resolviera nada al contrario sali perdiendo porque me ROBARON el cargador, el cargador no cuesta nada yo se pero la irresponsabilidad del local al decir que no lo tiene es la que no me gusto .......... NO LE COMIENDO A NADIE   ESTE LUGAR 👎👎👎👎👎👎< /text>
