I went in for two tires, I had called all around LA for and they told me I couldn't find those anymore. Not discouraged, I called Mexicali and he had exactly what I needed for an absolute bargain. I came in and there were two guests ahead of me, yet somehow I was out within 30 minutes. I've never had such rapid and professional auto work. I cannot recommend this place enough!< /review>

<Review>The  gentleman here are always extremely friendly! They stock a smorgasbord worth of tires all different sizes.  NEW AND OLD ....I had 4 tires changed for 75 a piece( the standard used tire price,  my only complain is that they lack the proper equipment to balance the tire. I had a cracked rim also...they referred me to another gentleman on the lot who did a great job at welding my AMG rim before Mexicali installed the final tire onto the rim. Great work ethic. Good peeps. I will be a long lasting customer!!!!</Review>< userid>

<Review>I’m not sure if other women feel this way, but I’m often intimidated when I need to take my car in to get work done. I don’t know a whole lot about cars, and I’m very much aware of how easy it is to take advantage of the situation by raising prices.
I will NEVER worry about that when I’m at Mexicali!! Mario is fantastic. I took my car in for new tires, and he took one look at my tires and went, “no you don’t need new tires, these ones are perfectly good.” He checked them out, pumped the tires with a little bit of air, and sent me on my way. For FREE.
He took time out of his busy day to see me, and Mario even told me up front that he doesn’t believe in making a sale that doesn’t need to be made. He could have easily charged me the $150-200 for new tires, and chose to instead use his time to educate me.
Mexicali tires is where I’m definitely going to be whenever I need tire work done!! Mario takes pride in his business, and it shows. I cannot recommend it enough.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Non existent customer service here.. you can can wait indefinitely till anyone says hello or anything. Latinos will cut in line in front of you if you don't make your first move fast. Bottom line if you're in a hurry and don't want to waste your valuable time please do yourself a big favor Do Not Come Here for work to be done on your car.< /text>

<Review>Super friendly staff and the owner did everything he could to help me out with the issue.
I needed to replace a tire of a vehicle toyota corolla 99, I was driving around and the prices were just ridiculous, plus was hard to find tires for a vehicle that old.
Mario the owner gave me the best price for the tire I needed, even thhough I was looking for an used tired, ended up getting a brand new one due to the lower price and it made more sense cost wise.
So far the best service and lower prices I have seen in the valley so far. Highly recommend these guys.<//Review>< userid>

<time>1541010126637<//time><Text>This place is AMAZING.  I wouldn’t go elsewhere for s tire. No matter where I am I make sure I get here for tire or anything related to tire work. They’ll patch the tire your using for very cheap or they have lots of used tires in good condition with years of use on them. Owner is great as well. Bolts broke while trying to put on a donut and owner told me exactly what I needed , and to come by and get everything done with tire and all for $100. I only had $80 so he took the $80. Highly recommended

Great place to get a used tire quickly. A few years ago I bought a good used tire from them, which served well until I was able to afford a new set of four.

A few months ago my spare needed the valve replaced. I was prepared to purchase another used tire to replace it, but the helpful young man had the integrity to tell us that the old one was fine for use as a spare, though it meant a smaller profit for him.</text>

Very honest and professional place. I had a huge piece of metal in my tire. A chain brand name place said it could not be fixed since it is close to the edge. They offered me a new tire for $275. These guys fixed the tire in 15 minutes and charged only $25. They only said "since the damage was big and close to the edge they needed a special patch. Otherwise they were going to charge $15" I highly recommend!
--------

Update: after three months and 3K miles, the tire is still OK without an issue.<//text>

<Review>I have been buying tires from Mario at the vanowen location for over 7 to 8 years. Not only do they work fast they treat everyone with a lot of respect very pleasent. Prices very reasonable. But most importantly Mario and his team have treated me all the time as if I were a family member. I highly recommend them because the work they do is mostly close to miracle work..am not joking...I recently had trouble with one of my tires and I called Mario. After I explained how the tires were wearing out he said you'll make it here don't worry... Sure enough I drove from close to orange county and my tire made it only ridding on the metal belts...he is the best and tells it like it is...unlike many places that tells you anything for the sake only of a sale...this man tells you the truth..he's a true Christian family...so next time you need tires...GO SEE MARIO AT THE VANOWEN LOCATIONS...you'll be happy you did...thank you Mario< /Review>< resp>

This place is AMAZING! Mario was awesome and Jorge was super fast. I felt like I was at a nascar pit stop! They were friendly and the price was unbelievable!
My friend from out of town woke up to a slash on the sidewall of her tire. She couldn't afford a new tire but we were calling around for a good used tire at an affordable price. I got a quote right over the phone and Mario welcomed us to go at anytime.
When we arrived it was busy but we were immediately acknowledged and when I told him what we needed the tire was immediately being changed.
It literally was approx 15 mins! Who does that? No where in LA can you drive up and get a new used tire in 15 mins for 40 bucks</text>

<Review>I was desperate to get back to Arizona after having a blow out on the freeway, and Mario with the help of his staff corrected a bad Big O Tires mistake (they put 215's on my car instead of 205's)

They worked with me and came up with SUPER used tires as well as rotating the remaining tires to accomodate my needs!

I WOULD RECCOMMEND THESE PEOPLE to anyone who cannot afford stupidly expensive new tires, but need safe tires for their car!

EXCELLENT JOB FELLAS!!!!<//Review>< user_name>

Mario asked what happend to our car, he said if we were drunk because we crashed the car and we got a flat tire, and he asked if he would patch the tire but we said no , we were going to buy a new tire. He knew what had happend because minerva told him my freind enersto was drunk in his ranch and crashed a gate at high speed, minerva and sofia told everybody what had happend ahahahaha , when we got to the tire shop , mario act like he knew nothing what happend and that was cool , and a fatty that was rude checked our flat tire to see where was the hole, and mario got our new tire for 120 dollars , very good price and ernesto celebrate with a beer because the price was good, and this was our happy trip to mexicali tires , see you tommorow mexicali tires , thank you for the good service and good price , except for the fatty , tommorow i will post the fatty's name</Review>

I have been a customer for a long time, love the energy, how nice & friendly staff & ownership.  Water is very important & knowing that politicians, water department, & bottled water companies are in bed with chemical companies &  giving us reclaimed water, no way would I give that to my family & friends, not even to my dogs.  I am a customer for life. thank you Einar for the best alternative.<//text>

The Water Brewery is the only place I recommend to get the highest quality water. The A.M.O.R.E. water is my all-time favorite and I love adding the boosters as well. The customer service from their team is always awesome. The owner, Einar, is kind and delighted to share his knowledge if you have questions about anything. I have been coming here for years and I want to drink this water for the rest of my life. It is my pleasure supporting this business each week.</Text>

These guys are the best.  Customer service is bar none.  Always very friendly, very professional, very knowledgeable and very efficient.  Can't wait  for their new delivery service, since I can no longer lug the bottles from auto to home.  No issue from brewery to auto, since the employees are more than happy to help.  Can't say enough about this place.  Get your water here.<//Review>

<review>I'm upset with myself that I've lived in the area for nearly a year and made my first foray into The Water Brewery this past weekend. They've got a very cool vibe right as you walk in, with helpful and friendly staff who walk you through the different offerings of water.

The real treat though, lies further back in the smoothie/tonic/elixir bar area. Extremely high quality ingredients make for potent concoctions.. I'm going to have to allocate a non-insignificant portion of my budget to this place, as I simply can't wait to try out everything on their menu.<//review>< Pics>

Absolutely amazing. Came out from Texas to visit a friend and try out local food and coffee. From beginning to end it was a pleasant experience, wonderful drinks, customer service was friendly, and the almond cookies were astounding. To top it all off they let us refill our water bottles with their fantastic water. Highly recommend.</text>

This place is amazing. Try their food, very high vibe and healthy. Been drinking their water for 5 years, and have recommended this place to many friends and family members. Would rate more stars If I could. Their bliss water is unlike any water I have had. Close to perfect.< /Review>

Awesome resource for amazing water and now this new location has food and elixirs. I had the coconut cabbage salad and it was amazing, sweet, tart and crunchy.  They have food served at the bar or in a cafe diner, very quiet but serene. I'll be making regular trips here!</review>

< Review>
Braces by Garcia was highly recommended to us.  It did not disappoint!!  We are absolutely thrilled we chose this Dr and his practice.  My daughter is 8 years old and was very nervous.  But they explained everything in detail and quickly put her mind to rest. It’s been 6 hours after and she has no pain. She’s eating soft stuff and medium-soft stuff with no issues. She had braces put on the top only for this two step process. Great cash discount too!!  Very Happy!!<//Review>

<text>I would give the Temecula office more stars if possible! This is by far the best experience my family and I have had at an orthodontist. Not only was the staff friendly and accommodating but the Dr.s we're amazing. They made my 10 year old feel so at ease with the whole process of her braces. A BIG thank you to Dr. Garcia and staff.</text>< date>

<Review>Who doesn’t love Dr Garcia and his team?? They are so awesome and they make the process of getting your dream smile fun! Not only do Dr Garcia’s patients love him, he is admired and respected by his fellow orthodontists across the country and around the world. Braces by Garcia is the place for you and your family to get orthodontic treatment. Enjoy the journey and your new smile! 😁👍<//Review>< Pics>

<review>They wouldn't let me in with my 12 year old today. They did a temperature check on him and gave him hand sanitizer, why not do that to one guardian so they can hear what's going on and it doesn't have to be interpreted through a 12 year old? Is it fine for the legal guardian to come in and pay now? Answer that and stay fashionable Braces by Garcia!  5/27/20 Edit: I was called today by Justin who explained to me the procedure and that they will work to accommodate the parents that are with minors that can't make decisions that are needed during the appointment. I really appreciate how this office handled this situation.<//review>< Pictures>

Both of my children have received orthodontic care from Dr. Garcia.
We did 2 phases with my daughter many year's ago and just started care for our son.

We're very happy with all the aspects at Braces by Garcia.

We so grateful for you opening in Menifee. We chose to drive to Temecula year's ago but now you're only a quick 7 minutes from us!

Thank you for providing excellent service and care.< /Review>

We were waiting to see If my daughters braces would be approved With our insurance. We went there in November and it didn’t get sent until February, we got denied and still they didn’t tell us. They told us that we had to pay out of our pocket. Those are the exact words. This place is horrible I will never ever ever go there again I’m finding a new orthodontist for my daughter. Some people can’t afford certain things and that’s just selfish of them to even say that we need to pay out of her own pocket’s. Horrible.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Garcia's office is staffed by a team of incredibly warm and courteous professionals.

Julie was amazing, helpful, and went out of her way to make my visit effortless.  A visit to this office means to literally walk in and smile from start to finish.  They've got everything handled.

Thank you, Braces by Garcia team, for the pleasant experience.< /text>

Everyone was so inviting and nice! From the lady at the check in desk, to the lady who first came out to get my son, to the next lady name Crystal who came out to get my son, to the super engaging orthodontist Dr Jose Garcia. He came highly recommended by my kids’ dentist whom I absolutely trust and adore.  They all made us feel really comfortable and answered all our questions with information I felt I could trust. I didn’t feel pressured to go with a certain option and actually look forward to working with this staff in the near future.<//Review>

We have been going to Dr Garcia for about a year now. I did my research regarding different orthodontists in the area. This office is well managed and the staff is friendly. As a busy mother of 2 I appreciate that they get us in on time and we never have to wait! The staff and Dr. is amazing and always super friendly! This is a place my daughter enjoys and looks forward to going to!<//review>

<review>I would recommend Smith and Garcia Orthodontics to anyone.  Dr. Garcia is a trusted and honest orthodontist. He is very knowledgeable and a perfectionist. He makes sure that your teeth are what it should be. My family and I got our braces around the same time. We have been going to Dr. Garcia for over 4 years. Every time we have gone in for our appointments, we have always been pleased with the service that we received. Dr. Garcia and his staff are amazing. Their friendliness and their professionalism makes you smile when you leave their office. They care about each and every one of their clients. Mary, who is their office administrator, has always been very accommodating with helping us with our appointments. She greets every clients by their name. That's what I call geat customer service. I have never waited more than 5 minutes for an appointment. I am now more confident with my smile. Smith and Garcia Orthodontics is a great place with great treatments.< /review>< resp>

Absolutely hands down the best experience a parent can have. I wish I could give this place 20 stars cause honestly they deserve it. Where do I begin? I was suppose to get my 2 daughter's braces at Western Dental but after adding up all the payments that i would be making it didnt add up. They add on a 11.95% finance charge and it equaled an extra $1,000 per kid so I decided to get one more quote before making a decision. Thank God I did! I found Braces by Garcia on google, called that same day, and got my 2 girls in for a consultation the next day. The employees in there are SUPER polite it's so clean in their office and the Doctor, Dr. Garcia he explains everything to the T. His payment coordinator Frances was so lovely. She made me feel at ease especially since I'm paying for 2 kids braces. It was almost half of what I was going to pay at Western Dental. I'm so happy I stumbled upon this place. If your kids need braces COME HERE you won't be dissapointed!!!<//Review>

I was pleasantly surprised !
I have two children that I brought in to be examined for braces, the staff was kind and very helpful through the process and clearly explained the options and cost.  Dr. Garcia was wonderful and made us all feel comfortable with our decision.< /Text>

<text>We love Dr. Garcia's office and staff.  They are always polite, professional and proficiently timely.  We don't recall the assistant that helped us yesterday, but all are very nice!  We would recommend this dental office to any of our family and friends.  Alexandra's teeth look fantastic.< /text><user>111340724760062444019<//user><Resp>None</Resp>< date>

<Review>Braces by Garcia has worked with us in all aspects of having braces. They are always very friendly and work around our schedule. My son who is away at college broke his retainer and they were able to get him in at a reasonable time so he could be back at school on time. Thank you for being flexible!!< /Review></record>

Dr Garcia and his team are some of the most professional, caring and capable care provided you can find.

They took care of my son’s needs with kindness, understanding and with great results.
I would definitely recommend them.< /text>

Madison just got her braces off... YEAH!!  Braces by Garcia is the friendliest office I have ever been to.  Everyone is always in a good mood and always willing to stop and chat for a minute.  Appointment are scheduled on the spot for future visits and they are always able to work around my schedule.  If anyone is looking for an honest, reliable ortho office.....  this is the place to go.</Text>

Great results! The care and time taken to ensure perfection was their top priority. I came to Dr. Garcia because he came highly recommended from friends of my daughters who have experienced the same. The staff is caring and friendly and very passionate about what they do!</Text>

Aside from the A-MA-ZING and super professional staff including Dr. Garcia, Cynthia, the technician that installed my son's braces, the sweet lady at the front office, we would like to give special THANKS to the person that handled our case though the insurance and made sure all prerequisites were met before turning it in, so we had the highest chance of approval.

In addition, and prior to coming here, we had visited another specialist that had quoted us a hefty premium over Dr. Garcia, while at the same time their facilities and customer care wasn't anywhere near the same level.

We are at the beginning of the treatment and so glad we came here. We couldn't recommend you enough Doctor. Thank you and Happy New Year to all!!!<//Review>

So grateful for such kind people at this place. It is so rare these days to actually go into a business and they know you and your first name and you feel like a real person.  My life the last few years has been pure chaos and sometimes you just need someone to have a little mercy on you. I talked to Kim today and she was so nice to talk to and you could sense the sincerity about her which is so nice and refreshing. She reassured me and helped sort out an issue that I had caused because I am so scatter-brained lately and did it with such kindness. I can't thank you enough!!   ((hugs))< /Text>

I have had four children get braces from Smith and Garcia,and I have been absolutely thrilled with their care. Smith and Garcia are extremely professional, timely, and friendly. Our experiences have been super positive with beautiful results. I highly recommend Smith and Garcia. You will definitely be pleased with your results, care, and treatment!<//review>

Dr. Garcia and staff has been great! Very professional and pleasant to work with for the last few years. My daughter's smile is wonderful and all treatment went smoothly. Luckily our insurance was accepted and they also did no interest payments, such a help. Looking forward to working with them again when my next daughter is ready.< /text>

Braces by Garcia is just exceptional! Their service, staff, and over-all performance is just amazing! I had my braces their last year 2017 and Francise (not sure of the spelling) was very accommodating, very friendly, and respected your decision in everything. I didn't have a regular job that time, yet she offered to adjust my monthly payment so I can have my braces that day. Dr. Garcia amazes me on how he handles his patients one at a time and he really do provide proper care to us patients. Well done, BBG team! Keep everything up!</Text>

We simply love and appreciate Braces By Garcia and all the staff.   We have had three children receive their treatment here.  Including a son who has had medical challenges.  Braces By Garcia has gone above and beyond working as a business.  They build relationships. When price comparing with other organizations, know with Braces By Garcia there are no hidden costs.< /review>

The front staff understands our lives are busy and they work hard to make appointments that fit in with your schedule. I am very pleased we chose this office for our orthodontic needs :)<//text>< date>

I love going to see Dr. Garcia and the staff!  Although I'm older, I never feel out of place and the staff is so helpful and fun and professional!  There is always some drawing (this month the kids could submit their mom's names for a pedicure drawing!) and kids earn "ortho bucks" to "buy" rewards.  They've thought of everything.  Highly recommend this practice!<//Text>

I took my two daughters to get a first time exam in the brand new Menifee location and I was pleasantly surprised at just how beautiful the office is and how sweet all the staff, including Dr. Garcia were. I am so excited to have Dr. Garcia get my girls started with their braces and new smiles!< /review>

Dr Garcia and his staff were very professional and courteous. Their prices were very competitive and the time that my kids had to spend in braces was not as much as I thought it would be. Would definitely recommend them for orthodontic services! Too bad he isn't a regular dentist because I would definitely keep coming back! Thank you Dr Garcia and staff!</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I'm not one for giving reviews, however this is an exception. My two  children were patients of Dr. Smith when Dr. Garcia was Dr. Smith's Practice Partner. That was several years ago. They are grown adults now. Dr. Smith has since retired and passed the practice to Dr. Garcia.Well, now its was my turn to take care of some minor teeth alignment issues. As the staff was back when my kids were patients, they still are. To say they are accommodating, engaging and of coarse friendly. Dr. Garcia is professional yet not intimating. I'm at the tail end of my treatment with Invisalign and couldn't be happier. It only took ten months for my teeth look beautiful. Can't say that the time frame would be the case for everyone since I didn't have manger work that needed to be done. Going to a great Doctor is one thing but when they have the staff thats great behind them, thats a real blessing. I would certainly and with no reservation recommend Dr. Garcia and his wonderful Staff.</text>< pictures>

I am highly satisfied and grateful to dr. Garcia for helping me. Not only have I seen a lot of improvement in my teeth, but it have given me the confidence to smile more. I highly recommend dr. Garcia. Dr. Garcia it's not only a awesome orthodontist, he is also a very smart men for hiring and having the best staff ever.🤗 Love Maria in the front desk and the rest of the staff they always have a smile and their face and treat you with love and respect. I'm very excited for the new office that they're going to open in Menifee, Buy Newport and Bradley... because it's only 2 minutes from my house. 😁Thanks again dr. Garcia for helping me and for your love, and dedication that you give all your clients.😊< /Review>

<text>I'm a forty year old woman with invisaligns. In many doctor's offices, you have wait way past your appointment time, because they overbook. However, in this office, most of the time, I get called back on my appointment time. The staff are courteous, upbeat, friendly, and remember me and other clients. Yes, most clients are teens, but they also treat adults and they speak to me as an adult, which I appreciate. Dr. Garcia has the vision to see if the outcome of my invisaligns are going as planned. He is going to tweet my plan a little, so that it goes in a better direction based on what my teeth are doing and their positions. I'm glad I chose to get my teeth straightened with this group.</text>< pics>

" Our middle child (of 5) was our first to get braces. Several other orthodontists looked at him and said they could not fix his severe under bite, that he would need to get surgery when he was older. Dr. Smith was the first orthodontist to give us a positive diagnosis. He not only fixed that child's under bite (without surgery being needed), we had 2 others who also had under bites, though not as severe, who now have beautiful smiles. While those 2 did end up needing surgery to correct severe cross bites along with the under bites, the oral surgeon he recommended was excellent! (and he was covered by our insurance, Yeah!) He also gave gorgeous smiles to our other 2 children. I always recommend Drs. Smith & Garcia whenever I am asked about orthodontists in our area. All in all, we had nothing but excellent service by Drs. Smith & Garcia. They are quite knowledgeable and treat their patients well. The office staff is friendly and easy to communicate with during visits and phone calls. Thank you, Drs. Smith & Garcia and Staff, for the wonderful service we received! "< /text>

I have been very pleased with Smith & Garcia Orthodontics.  They have treated both of my children.  My daughter just got her braces off and the results are stellar!  My son is just starting the process.  Dr. Garcia and all the staff make the patients feel comfortable.  They are warm, professional, and really take the time to get to know their patients.  The office is inviting and comfortable with video games for the kids to play while waiting and coffee for the parents!  They have a great rewards system called "ortho bucks" which motivates the kids to take good care of their braces/teeth in order to "buy" prizes!  I highly recommend this ortho office without reservation.<//review>

Getting Invisalign for my son was the best decision we could have made! Dr Garcia was so great to work with. Even though my son was the first Invisalign teenager he agreed to work with (several years ago), he listened to our reasons for wanting to go with the Invisalign and it turned out great! His results were amazing, and he progressed through the trays quickly because he was faithful and committed to wearing them 24/7. I know not everyone is a candidate for the Invisalign but I'm grateful my son was and if your child is a good candidate I highly recommend them and Dr Garcia. The staff and everyone has always been so helpful, even now over a year later when we had damaged/lost retainers and needed new ones. You can't find a better Orthodontist in this area!< /text>

<review>If you make an appointment with these guys make sure you check and double check that you still have your place in line. We cleared a whole day for our family to come and get our dog vaccinated. The day of our appointment there was no record of our appointment. Not to mention when I first called they told me they would call back after putting all my information in the computer they never called me back two days later I called back to make an appointment. Today was supposed to be my appointment and they have no record of it very unprofessional staff. They need to get it together< /review>< Rating>

Our dog ate a handful of raisins as we were passing through this area so we stopped to have her give them up! It wasn't cheap, but I have no idea what's typical for this sort of thing. The vet here was really nice and seemed legit concerned for our pup. Would return but hopefully won't need to!<//text>

< Review>
I was a customer of this office since they opened their doors. At the time I had one dog and several cats. All my animals were patients of this veterinary office. I had brought in two kittens that I rescued from my backyard. They asked me where I got the kitties from and I told the vet tech that I had rescued them from my backyard. When Dr. Woultee came in to our room. She very nastily asked me if I found kittens in my backyard all the time. I did not find this particularly funny at the time. The kittens had upper respiratory infections and they needed to be seen. They also said they would not see my cats if they were not spayed and neutered. All of my cats are spayed and neutered. I get my cats spayed and neutered at Turlock vet clinic. I get their shots there too. I take my animals to Monte Vista vet now for their needs. I would not recommend going to this vet. They are very overpriced as well.<//Review>

< review>
The Patterson office used to be my main veterinarian of voice until I called to have my dog spayed and her yearly booster shot. Since they have switched owners(vet) they became very unorganized, raised prices to much  and had lost records which are going to end up costing me more money since they no longer have the original records to released to me or to her new veterinarian. I purchased the puppy pack 4 years ago and had the chip all the vaccinations for parvo rabies kennel cough completed plus the deworming and flea treatment that came with the pack although she did not have fleas or  worms it was just a bonus and preventive measure for puppies. So they wanted to recharge me to do all of her vaccinations again plus charge an extra hundred dollars more than the other vet in town for the spay. They asked me if I had proof of her shots even though they don't give you a shot record card like you have for a child because they put it in their system and print it out as a receipt with the service that you got. So all in all no I did not have four year old receipts at my disposal because they had been good about records in the past. I definitely learned my lesson and I'm very sad that I am no longer going to use them. One of the main things was they had previously had the records of her shots that were all up-to-date because 2 years ago I was going to have her boarded while I was out of town I just needed her rabies booster for the year( I had also originally asked if I should keep my own records and they said their system was high-tech and I didn't need to because they were safe and not going anywhere). I'm sorry I'm just not going to pay again for shots she already has nor was I going to have her injected with all new doses of the same shots she's had I don't know how safe that would be seeing how vaccines carry a little bit of the virus for Immunology.</review>

<text>Dr. Wuoltee is not only an exceptional vet, she is a wonderful person. The first time I met Dr. Wuoltee I rushed my dying cat who was mauled by a stray dog to the Patterson office just at closing time. I called the office while enroute to give em a heads up. The receptionist said they were closing for the day. I explained the situation,, Dr. Wuoltee waited for me to arrive and immediately  sprang into action. Moments later Dr. Wuoltee sadly informed me it was too late. Having to take in the unfortunate loss was extremely emotional. I stopped at the front desk to pay  Dr. Wuoltee said "no charge."  I couldnt express my gratatude and appreciation enough.
Dr. Wuoltee goes over and beyond from making house calls to examine and vaccinate hard to transport pets, to actually sitting on the exam room floor (pregnant even) and establishing a genuine bond with my lrg breed dog. Its going on 6 yrs and now I drive from Escalon to Patterson for vet appts. But it's worth it and I wouldn't go anywhere else.</text><user>105640591722382404568<//user><Date>1510139080220<//Date><gmapID>0x8091b3df3cbe2397:0x619b0661a5d9aedf< /gmapID><name>Jeniece<//name>< Response>

I tried the Cajun Spicy Chicken sub and it was delicious! The Cajun mayo was SO good. Next time I’ll be sure to ask for extra. I think a medium is the perfect size- it’s 8 inches.

Overall, great experience, good food, and I would recommend trying Firehouse Subs if you haven’t.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNORHLz0NI6PusaPtCgYk-JnnZGw-7oe3Gatdto=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1580924383371, 'text': "Kristel, we're very pleased to hear that the Commons at La Verne team was so great and that you tried our Cajun Chicken sub and loved it.

<Review>Some of the sandwich selections are interesting. Not your typical sandwiches. I got a pastrami Reuben which I'd only for a limited time only.  The decor is ok. Lots of firefighter memorabilia and actual fireman gear. From helmets to boots. There big on their pickles here. They tested fine nothing spectacular. They offer many different selections of hot sauces. I was not into the hot sauces nor did I remember a sandwich I like that required me to put hot sauce on it. The soda machine was touch screen activated with lots of drinks till choose from.<//Review>< Pics>

Why isn't anyone answering the phone? I just left there. My sandwich is horrible. I want my money back and a new sandwich or i wont ever come back. Especially with me having to call this location over 10 times. I don't want to waste my gas, neither do i want to keep going out during quarantine. Usually my sandwich is made with love, that dude made it like he homeless.< /Text>

Great staff and good tasting food. I had the small hot pastrami combo and my nephew had the large Hero combo. Mine came with cheese which was unexpected and they were immediately offering to remake it with an apology which I greatly appreciated but decided to try it and must say that it tasted very good.
There is at least one bathroom, although I forgot to check if they were unisex or not.<//text>

<Rate>3< /Rate><text>Not a wow factor for my first visit. In a blink, two small drink, medium size sub combos will cost $24.60!  Look at the pictures, and accept the fact that you will get half the amount of meat than the picture suggests, putting into context the logical question of where your $20-some dollars went exactly. The "hot specialty" subs don't include the bread; I just assumed that the sub would be warm, at minimum, toasted at best. Nope, not a chance. Won't return.</text>< Pics>

<Date>1545949319410</Date><rating>1</rating><review>Husband and I ordered a sandwich  and a chopped salad with roasted chicken.

We noted at the time there were people waiting for their order, but had no idea how long hey had been there. We assumed the person taking the order was new.

While waiting a table was given a sandwich, which the patrons were touching and lifting the bread to see if it was what they ordered. One of the associates came back to the table, took the sandwich and handed it to another patron who this sandwich apparently belonged to. We were in shock. No health codes here?

Since we got our meal to go, it took 40 minutes to get our order. We drove home and when we opened the order I discovered there was no chicken in the salad. I called and as told that they had “a lot of tickets and the salad I ordered was PROBABLY a salad they sell that has no meat”. I clearly stated my order. The gentleman told me that when I come back, if I tell them what happen they “may” give me a free bag of chips to fix the problem. Husbands sandwich was not to his order either. We realize they are new, no doubt learning. However, the service at this time is very poor and the fact that we waited for 40 minutes for a meatless salad and a sandwich that was not to order and witnessed an associate take food from a table and hand to another patron is enough for us to not return. We wish them well.</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Tried this sandwich place for the first time the other day. They had a special, a sandwich with ham,  turkey, or roast beef for $4.99 (drink and chips extra). It was a nice sized sub. The roast beef was pretty good. The decor was cute...fireman boots and other articles throughout the shop. The cashier wasn't the friendliest, but the cooks were really nice. They even thanked me when I left.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Gmap_id>

I've only been twice and my order is wrong. And each time minus the pickle. Tasty but not sure where the breakdown is. Order taker or sandwich maker.</review>

<text>I usually go to the one in Rancho so stopped in here because I know the quality is always great and the staff are always friendly. I got the firehouse pub steak and it was delicious, but there was pitiful amounts of meat. The one in Rancho always puts enough to the point that the bread can barely hold it together. I probably won't be coming to this location again and stick with Ranchos'.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Good, not great, and slow, compared to other sandwich places. We didn't catch that the order taker did not hear that one of the sandwiches should have cheese on it; didn't want to see how long it would take to get it added... they are zero for 2 on our orders here.<//text>

Visited El Mariachi's for a special occasion. They have done in and was a good choice for us. The food was good, served hot (careful, the plates are very hot). Wait time from order to food wasn't horrible, being as 12 others arrived before our family arrived. The restaurant was fairly busy. They do limit capacity and take precautions. We felt safe eating here.</Text>

Just got an order delivered it was only 2 meals of pollo le crema, the exact same but with no onions and mushrooms in mine. Mine meal was 1/4 of the amount of my boyfriends, and my boyfriends onions were nothing but hand sized undercooked pieces of onions cores. Work on your food consistency.< /review>

I am a creature of habit and I ALWAYS order the same thing 😆  I absolutely love their #3 combination. Which is the Enchiladas with a side of beans and rice. I go there especially because they've got the Best Enchilada sauce and if you want Delivery,they actually give you so much food you ALWAYS have enough for leftovers!!!!!! There's only one other Mexican restaurant comparable to them here in Redding but they don't give you as much food to go and they don't Deliver😍😍😘😘😜<//text>< Pics>

First time dining here the other evening, and I cant come close to explaining how amazing the service,  the food, and the prices were. At a time like this, I highly encourage everyone to take there business too this local restaurant for outside dining and take out. These guys deserve it; putting up with a family of nine, including two children, and they were very patient and very friendly. It was one of the first times we've all had the chance to eat and see each other since this Covid lockdown, and a large thank you goes out to El Mariachi's for the amazing help.< /text>

<text>I have been coming here since the summer of 1997. With family and friends. The menu has changed appearance through the years BUT the food is still the best around. If you like Menudo this is the only Mexican restaurant that serves it. The employees are friendly 😀 and courteous. The overall  ambience, employees and food are the greatest. 👍👍👍👍👍😘💕<//text>< GmapID>

This was one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been too ever. The waitress took some of the best care of me I've ever had at any restaurant. The food was on par and full of delicious flavors. I stumbled into this place on new year's eve after a long day of work. Everything else in town was closed. I was driving for about 20 minutes looking for something in a town that I am new in. I seen the open light on and went in. After the experience I had at this place tonight I dont really care to look into going to any other mexican restaurant in town. Finding this place was like winning the Mexican food lottery.< /review>

It has a few highs and a few lows. The chips were good but the salsa tasted from a can not fresh,  the tortillas were not hand made. The guacamole was good. But the carnita tasted dry. The plate I got was badly chipped on the side. The personal was friendly.<//Review>

This use to be our favorite restaurant for Mexican,  but this time it was not good,  salsa tasted like a can of tomato sauce,  the carnita was over cooked.  Very disappointed!!☹< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>I do not like leaving bad reviews, that being said this place needs it. The waitress that initially sat us and took our order was friendly. Then things just went downhill from there. There was only one other person in the restaurant ordering food and it took a really long time for our order to arrive, when it did my wife's food was cold and my order was wrong. My food did not taste good at all. I was able to eat my beans and one enchilada because I was incredibly hungry. Then it took forever to get our bill and by the time we payed and got out to our car I vomited. I then vomited 6 more times at home. My wife who only ate a small portion of her cold food was  nauseous but thankfully didn't eat enough to get sick like I did.  I recommend trying somewhere else if your craving Mexican food.< /Text>< pics>

<review>Excellent food, service, and a salsa bar are what makes this place awesome. I really like the interior design as well.  All the staff are super friendly and courteous.  The place is neat and clean.  If you've never tried El Mariachi's I highly recommend it!<//review>< user>

El Mariachi's is one of our favorite places to eat. Have had almost everything on the menu and loved it. Salsa bar,tableside guacamole,homemade carrots and jalapenos. Tequila poppers at the end. Stop in and enjoy.<//Text>

Just finished a date here and the food was very tasty! 5 minutes after the bill came, both my boyfriend and I started feeling really sick. We are currently taking turns using the restroom. I give them a 2 star as I sit on the toilet, only because the margarita was really good.</text>

The food is athletic for the most part but was not up to my standards. Seating is bad in most parts of the restaurant and seems abandoned most of the time. On a good note they have great deals for your children.<//review>

<user_name>Quentin Foredyce<//user_name><Text>Worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Nachos were dry and over baked (ate maybe 6 chips) quesadilla supreme with shredded beef was just a shredded pot roast that even had the bay leaf in it still whole inside the quesadilla (ate 2 bites) Chile rellano was disgusting. Only thing we had was a side enchilada and a coke. Server didn't ask why we didn't eat anything nothing was comped so enchilada and a coke (which a refill was never offered) cost 40 bucks. Never going again.<//Text><Rate>1<//Rate><user_id>111419750699752721346</user_id></record>

The food was okay, not overly impressive. I had the Pollo Cancun, it lacked an overt flavor profile. The chips and salsa were good. However I was hoping for a less bland sauce and flavor to the Pollo dish.<//Text>

Best Micheladas in town, awesome authentic food at a reasonable price. My new favorite!

Update 10/15/2020. Got Chimichangas again. They were massive, the length of my arm from wrist to elbow. See my pic that I uploaded, this place is no joke. Absolutely delicious ground beef.< /Text>

The food is good, and the prices are fair, but the reason this is my favorite mexican restaurant is because of the service: everyone is super friendly, and the food comes quick!  The servers are attentive, and would bend over backward to make sure you are happy.<//text>

<review>This is our go to Mexican restaurant and also our default take out option when we've had a busy day.

We sit down here once every couple months, but normally just order take-out or entree express. We've never had a bad meal here, the food is always good, and there is A LOT of it. Cheap too, we spend about an average of $30 - $40 for a family of four, including two 10 year old boys with hollow legs.

The atmosphere is welcoming and traditional, they always have drink specials, and they have a killer salsa bar. (Almost literally once... the green paste is NOT avocado, it's pureed jalapenos lol, yikes)

The boys always split a machos nachos, which is steak fries smothered  in nacho cheese and all the fixins. Not necessarily Mexican food, but they really like it. I recommend the rolled taquitos, and hubby always gets some sort of burrito smothered in some sort of sauce. (I'm extremely observant, I know) We always have leftovers for lunch the next day.

I highly recommend El Mariachis. It's good food and it's cheap. And there are so many ways to get it, whether going in, calling and picking it up, or having it delivered. (That's $8 extra tho)

There is no way that this restaurant can be rated 4 stars.  We had a very bad experience with the food.  The server was great and very welcoming but the food quality was no good.  It seems as if they don't know what traditional Mexican food is.<//Text>

Just made a delivery order. Paid the service delivery lady. Sat down with family to eat.  And there is no rice and beans.  I immediately called back to the restaurant and told him we were not given any rice and beans.  He said the lady who took your order said we didn't want any.  This was not true.  Then he wanted me to pay for the rice and beans and the extra service delivery charge a second time, if we still wanted the rice and beans. Food wise, the carne asadas drip lots of greasy oil and are very salty.</Text>

Great customer service. The food was slightly bland and a little too much cheese on all the dishes that were ordered.< /review>

<date>1372129576325<//date><Pics>None</Pics><Text>This evening I was struck by a need for Tacos.  Not wanting to go out, I ordered delivery from this establishment, and was sorely disappointed.

I wanted 6 tacos.  I got 4.
I wanted no veggies (because I'm odd like that).  That left just a taco shell and the meat.  No cheese?  No sour cream or anything?  At $2.99 per carne asada taco, that's some poor value.
Then I find the "chicken" tacos are a mix of shredded chicken and various plant matter that make an unwanted mush.  Would have been nice to know when I was making the order.  $2.25 per taco wasted.
I wanted hard shells, but the two carne asada were soft tacos.  I didn't specify, that one's on me.

So, I just paid $18.23 for a handful of carne asada and two soft corn tortillas to be delivered.  Not counting the tip to the driver, whom was friendly and not at fault.

Guess who's not going to patronize this place anymore?<//Text>< Response>

< Review>
Awful service, false advertising! We went there Sunday after church because of the "kids eat for $1". Gabriel offered terrible service by not coming to our table, getting us our drinks, sides, and charged us full price for the kids meal because "the owner said to". Won't be back!</Review>

< review>
Just a regular gas station in Stockton. Just passing thru on our way home. 10:30pm tired & needed gas. Before being able to swipe my card, put the nozzle in my tank & choose a fuel grade we are hit up for money & asked to purchase a swisher sweet! It sucks that businesses here don't even bother to ask the "locals" to leave. Loitering in Stockton is a serious problem.< /review>

The new girl sandy makes your sandwich like she was gonna eat it herself. You can tell she actually cares how its going to turn out when its eaten. Not just sorta slapped together like most do. Hope she doesn't lose that. The place needs it.< /review>

The guy was killing my bread.. he doesn’t even know how to make a sandwich. I asked lettuce, but he gave me jalapeño….<//Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>Good subway for a small town. Only one employee at a time, fast enough. Staff was friendly, food was okay, although I noticed a decline in food quality as I went to different towns. I would recommend that you do takeout, outside seating isn't very great. Tables aren't maintained, and they are very uncomfortable. They aren't offering inside dining at the moment.< /Review><Rate>3</Rate><UserId.>112003158495957640977</UserId.><gmapID>0x809d6a2338a32d1f:0x233b274b335ec5d6< /gmapID>< Date>

I adore this spot! They offer great dishes, their menu is varied, The chef in that spot is a specialist, I like a lot tasting all their food. The dishes are always of high class, the attitude towards the visitors  is good. I often eat in this place and I was never unhappy. Highly recommended.< /review>

I dislike giving negative reviews, but I have to.

The two workers were bickering to the detriment of customer service.  I had to repeat my order two or three times AT EACH STEP, and they still got it wrong.  (I asked for double meat, and didn't notice that they missed it until the sandwich came out of the oven).

They didn't have things prepped.  Out of tomatoes on the line while one worker was frantically cutting them in the back.

Not a pleasant experience.  Food was typical Subway.</text>

We've come here twice and both times the service was horrendous. This time was the worst. We weren't asked what we wanted, the guy just looked at us. We gave him our order, and waited. An online customer came in and he stated her order wasn't ready as he, "has had one customer right after the other." He then said she should work there. She declined. We're in Chester and the store has three customers in it. That was busy? As we left, we reminded ourselves that Holiday does sandwiches and they're just down the street.</Review>

Went there for dinner last night around 4. Was offered freezer burned handful of lettuce for my partner's  sandwich and was told  she couldn't open new lettuce until someone used the brown disgusting lettuce. I don't eat bread so had to have a spinach salad. That's just poor customer service shame on you Subway. We won't be returning.< /Text>

<Review>Good suba at a fair price. Great teamwork as there were dozens at the shop with 10 ahead of us when we arrived. The team of 4 served everyone quickly and efficiently. It turned out that one of the staff was new and being trained. No problems with the foid.<//Review><user>115671615554346312936< /user></record></dataset><record>

<review>I went in about 20 minutes before they closed my dog that I had with me jumped out of the window and came into the restaurant we had just gotten back from the lake he is a service dog however he did not have his vest on the young ladies were very pleasant about it when I apologized they greeted me when I walked in they said have a good night when I left they let the little girl pet my dog so I didn't have to take the dog out he really truly is a service dog not mine but he is a service dog I take him to the lake and walk him for the family I just want to say all these negative reviews that people give probably never worked in a restaurant or customer service but again I forget the ladies names the two young ladies they were very sweet polite and very smart when was counting the bread and she did it boom bing boom anyways on and on I can go about how pleasant and clean the place was</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Most depreciated people in food industry. Not recommended. Just because they don’t want to work they automatically reschedule you without notice. They cost you a day to deliver here. Poor managed property. Will never send a truck here again. Ruthless and they do not honor their scheduled appointments. They are liars. Horrible manager during the day shift. Not sure who runs the show here but extremely unprofessional. No more trucks to these people. Avoid if all possible. They are so disgusting I don’t even want to shop where they deliver. Had a delivery 5/24 and they lied saying their system showed 5/25 even the shippers BOL shows delivery date 5/24 also the broker same thing. Horrible experience every time. This is the last time i will ever send truck there again.< /review>< Pics>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Don’t pull up to the gate before 4AM. It will automatically open. 10 minutes to 4 lady kicks me out if the yard and tells me to come back at 4.

“Nobody can be in here until 4, you have to leave and come back at 4”.

“But that’s in ten minutes, the gate opened as I was calling the phone number”.

“There’s nobody here sir, nobody can be in here, you need to get out and come back to the gate at 4, push the call box button and give me your PO#”.

Parked on the street and waited 5 minutes.

Roll up to the gate at 3:59. Push the button at 4:00. Rings and rings with no answer.

She gets on the PA Sarcastically. “Driver at the gate...you need to push the button to give me a PO# so I can open the gate and assign you a door”.

Push the button again, stops ringing, push it again and after a few rings she answers.

“Sorry, I DID push the button and it’s been ringing with no answer”.

So don’t call the phone number as the sign says either. No one will answer that. Push the call box button.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Reading all reviews before arriving here made me think i will get in long trouble, however in fact this was the quickest delivery i ever made for US Foods
40 minutes in and out, nobody was rude, parking is still a issue around this place, park at your own risk on the street just in front of the gate or on Oak street just next to Home Depot</Review></record></dataset><record>

People ok. But my load was loaded late. They rescheduled delivery. This was stop 2.     200 reschedule fee and 200 late fee. Until companies quit delivering to these places. They will continue to rip off the consumer.</text>

Slow as a turtle up here, still waiting to get unloaded, almost four hours later. It's like they remove one pallet every thirty minutes to an hour. And then have the nerve to ask about a lumper payment. Truly hope I never come back here. You better come here with plenty of time to spare, because this place eats your clock up.</review>

<Text>the receiving staff is friendly, and professional, but it IS u.s. foods... they aren't going to be the quickest delivery on your schedule. I have found that if I'm paying the lumper service, it goes pretty quick... but if the load was pre-paid, I'll be there for a while.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dc74ef681695ab:0xb51c247769fc95fd< /GmapID>< pics>

Yes very true U.S. foods took 5.5 hours to unload me plus they are pretty thorough about checking loads for damage so keep in mind you may get OS&D, on the good side a nearby sandwich shop called vistas icebox real close and has truck parking on the street facing south.< /Review>

Truck got delayed 12hours at Pilgrim's Pride in Nacogdoches, TX which killed my driving hours, dispatch rescheduled for Tuesday morning instead of Monday morning so when I get to US Foodservice in Vista CA they charge me $150 for the reschedule I explained to receiving what had happened in Nacogdoches,  TX but they didn't care had to pay $150 & $170 for the lumper to unload a partial drop. It's bs but can't do anything about it.</Review>

<Text>Have your P.O. ready when checking in.  The reciever gets really mad if your unprepared...Overall it's a union warehouse,  Lumpur on site.. lunch truck comes by often... bathroom available to drivers.  Be prepared to be here 2-6 hours.</Text>< pictures>

this is one of the worst places to go and try to delivery a freight, at least 5 hours waiting time; be aware of the lady in the receiving office, if you're a driver she hates you from the bottom of her liver, if you blink loud you're in trouble she ill kick you out</review>

< Review>
The worst nail salon. I got my nails done for the first time. I was so excited. I showed her a picture of what i wanted. Instead, i got very thick, uneven and much wider nails than my actual nails. Also, she gave me a cut while shaping. She didn’t even cleaned my cuticles before applying acrylics. Worst experience.<//Review>

<Text>I’m a loyal customer at Dublin Nails. Min gives the best pedicures. He is thorough, never rushes, makes sure to trim your toenails in a way that prevents them from getting ingrown, and he spends a lot of time on the foot massage part! Super appreciated. Tien is my go to for acrylics. I’m always happy with my sets from him, and I get many compliments each time I get them done. He’s up on what’s trendy and really does the best job. I always recommend Dublin Nails to my friends.</Text>< pics>

Had a pedicure here as my regular place shut down due to covid and was looking for my home spot.  So far I think this is it! My nails looked great, massage was amazing and the paint job looked amazing!< /review>

Got my nails done professionally for the first time and love the way they turned out! I got french tip acrylic extensions with gel polish. They had many employees at the salon so I was able to walk in and get an appointment immediately! The manicurist did a fantastic job and worked with me to figure out exactly what I wanted.< /review>

<Review>The moment the woman saw me walk into her nail salon she asked with hostility "how can we help you"? Looking at me in a very funny way like I cant afford the price here maybe because I'm of color. My nails were not done the way I liked because she asked  an apprentice to take care of me. I will never go there again.< /Review>< pics>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>Dublin Nails is amazing. I've been to other places. I live in Hayward and I drive to Dublin to get a pedicure. Hip and back problems so can't do my own toenails.
I don't go anywhere else.  Friendly, clean. I feel comfortable there. Been going for a few years now. I ask for Anna, but they are all angels.< /review><gmapID>0x808fec131e071597:0xb785dba49b296181<//gmapID><name>Mary Jo Hart< /name><Rate>5</Rate>< UserId.>

My sister and I both had pedicures today at the salon. Comfortable chairs, water was the perfect temperature,  overall cleanliness, friendly staff along with an excellent pedicure are why I am giving this salon 5 stars. They are sincere and really want to make sure you are happy with your nails. Looking and forward to a manicure here next and hoping this will be my "go-to" nail salon.< /review>

Tina has been doing my nails for over 10 years. If that isn't a rousing endorsement,  I don't know what is! She's a doll.</review>

< Review>
They are always very accommodating, which helps if you have a busy schedule or kids.

EDIT:
I usually see Tien when I get my acrylics and he is AMAZING. However, I was a little less impressed with one of the other technicians on a separate visit. (Nails were oddly clear looking despite being painted red.)

I request Tien everytime now. He is quick, accommodating, and has never accidentally filed to close to the skin or anything. It's the only pain free manicure I have ever had. They also look really good when they are done.</Review>

<Review>I've been coming here for years and love the way they do my nails.  Mani/Pedi is great!  One big issue for me is that it's freezing in this salon in the winter.  They keep the door wide open when it's 50 degrees outside.  All the staff and clients are wearing coats.  I asked twice if the door could be closed, and it was closed halfway (which did nothing to improve the inside temperature) only to be fully opened again later.  I shivered through an hour of mani/pedi time, which would have otherwise been enjoyable.  Sorry to report that I will need to find another nail salon since my last two visits here have been the same with not enjoying the experience because I was cold.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<review>Was passing through to LA from SF and me n a girlfriend needed some repairs done. I asked for the removal of an acrylic nail set. So the lady proceeded to pry my nails off with a new fake nail. She TORE MY PINKY NAIL BED IN HALF! I showed I was in pain and suddenly she 'had an appointment' after handing my hands for less than a five minutes. I was handed off to a man who did better but still was very rough. I left in pain paying $60... Worst experience EVER.< /review><rate>1< /rate><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808fec131e071597:0xb785dba49b296181< /GmapID></record>

They were good about keeping the shrimp coming which was surprising because normally restaurants are slow to bring out refills, hoping you don't eat as much. The steak was cooked to order but was extremely tough to chew.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Everything was underwhelming. The menu options are scant which makes them only marginally better than the actual food. If you're looking to pay $15-20 per person for food you can get from your grocery store freezer then this is your place.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

There's a couple of things I don't like about sizzler in general and one is that when you order your meal they don't bother to tell you the drink has to be paid for. They say okay you want this for dinner and what do you want to drink. And then charge you about $3 for the drink it used to be free. The other thing is it we could make our own salads had to make a list of what you wanted. That was brought to the table and that's the last we ever saw of our server our drinks were empty and never to be refilled. I normally always leave a tip but because I thought the service was so bad this is the first time I haven't left the tip. This is not typical service I expected is sizzler. But it is the typical way they end up selling you a drink in a misleading way. Chuck-A-Rama gives you the drink with a meal and quite frankly I think their meals are better than sizzlers but we didn't have an Chuck-A-Rama here in Auburn< /Text>

Our food came out staggered they waited over a hour for our food.. and then they said they didn't have the kids food. Forgot our salad and soups. No refills. The waiter accused us of stealing $20.

Service so so we waited and waited until finally I asked some guy cleaning the tables if he had any idea how long it would take for food or if waitresses even came into this area?  Mind you you walk in and place a order.I had totally finished my salad before this arrived to my husband. Not very hard messing up a piece of lobster a baked potato you're cooking a steak medium rare and topping it with mushrooms but the quality of your sirloin lousy! you should allow an upgrade for a better piece of meat. I now know why we haven't eaten at Sizzler in 20 years<//Text>

There was a reason I came..they offered dine-in..but there was something terribly wrong with the soup, and they ignored me. So I'm not going there again. I loved their food and servers BEFORE covid19.</Text>

We don't eat here more than a few times a year, but always enjoy it when we do.  We often have Christmas dinner here, which is fun.  We also ate here on New Year's Day, and Kim, our server,was terrific, as are all the staff we've encountered.   We like the senior meal deals, along with a glass of wine.  Steaks always cooked to our liking.< /Review>

I usually love this sizzler, but this time the salad bar was not as good as usual.I really love the chicken wings they have in the salad bar and I always look forward to them but when I went this time there were only four chicken wings there and when I went back for a second plate there were still none.I decided to just go with salads and when I use the blue cheese dressing it was very watered-down and so was the ranch. Usually I love everything in the salad bar.<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Sizzler is a known quantity for a great value: good food at a good price. The restaurant in Auburn, California is located just off the Interstate, just east of the historic Gold Rush era downtown.

My fraternity had one of their annual dinner meetings there, and although menu items improve through time, their standard steak and shrimp dinner with rice pilaf and a cold brew beckoned. Why fix/change something if it isn't broken?

Our group makes sure the wait staff are duly rewarded for bringing our meals, providing beverages and add-ons, and bussing the tables. Prompt friendly service with good dining. Give them a visit next time you're near.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwAqD0UngO9NN_5S0QrpQ_6jTqbBRp6m4dJWzT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Salad bar excellent!! Salad bar alone is worth going there. Steaks are good, well seasoned and tender, Malibu Chicken was overcooked and dry. Hot bar/taco bar looked unappetizing as it looked like many items were sitting in the hot table awhile. Soups were very good, and dessert bar was also very good with a lot of varieties.

<Text>I've always been a big fan of the endless sp and salad bar at Sizzler. For the most part today was no different. Loved the clam chowder and the salads I was able to make. Lots of choices for toppings and even the type of lettuce. The fried chicken which we normally love however was a little overdone today. But the bread and honey butter they bring to the table was excellent. Had a very nice meal with family from out of state.< /Text>< pictures>

Just OK. I like the one in sparks nevada better. The beef tips were very good. The waitress was very slow...I don't know how long I waited for her to bring my coffee, but seems like forever.</text>

<review>Unfortunately, Sizzler is not what it used to be. We were there for dinner and the Spanish rice and pasta looked like it had been there since morning. While we were eating, an 87 year old man fell once outside the restaurant and the staff would not call 911. They were asked twice to dial it, but would not.

Had not been to a Sizzler in years.  I had the Senior 6 oz  sirloin steak.  It comes with a plated salad, one side & a drink for $10.99.  If you sign up for their E  Club,  a few days later you get a coupon for a free classic burger & side.  I would get the steak again.<//Text>

the food here is really good. Hey it's sizzler. It's always sizzler and some things don't change about sizzler okay? Still you can count on the fresheness of their salad bar and the taste of their steaks to be top notch. The service is second to none!< /review>

You would have to have a $100- worth of vegetables all cleaned and raw on hand at home, no way, they would go bad before I could eat them all. It is buffet style for all the veggies. You make the salad yourself and you can have seconds if you want. Also included are fresh fruits and salads, like seafood, macaroni,  tuna and more! Part of the deal is you can make tacos included and some pasta and meatballs with a marinara sauce, fried chicken wings, cobbler, soft serve ice cream,  it's all included, can't beat it. Making myself hungry.< /review>< pics>

Meals on wheels for those who still have wheels! Wish they would put more effort into the steaks and a little less on all you can eat salad bar. Still the mature crowd needs a place to go. So thanks for that.<//Text>

I found a feather attached to one of my chicken wings. All the manager could say was "it's chicken, what's the problem". Call me crazy but I would prefer my food not to look like it should still be running around clucking. It totally ruined my meal. I'll never go back there.<//Text>

Each year when I visit my dad in Auburn, I simply must make one or more trips to Sizzler for the salad bar. Really great selection of salad stuff, along with other things that I never have room to eat. They offer a nice senior discount, too. The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is very clean, recently remodeled. There's an area that can be reserved for large group meetings, too.<//Review>

I haven't been to sizzler for a few years. I went for the salad bar and was really disappointed. For the two of us it was $33 for two salad bars and one iced tea. The pickings were slim. We usually only make one trip to the bar and perhaps a cup of soup. The service was very good and our server was very efficient. We probably won't be going back to sizzler, as we can find salad many other places at a much lower cost. This isn't particular to this one restaurant, but rather sizzler in general.<//Text>

<review>I haven't been to sizzler for a few years. I went for the salad bar and was really disappointed. For the two of us it was $33 for two salad bars and one iced tea. The pickings were slim. We usually only make one trip to the bar and perhaps a cup of soup. The service was very good and our server was very efficient. We probably won't be going back to sizzler, as we can find salad many other places at a much lower cost. This isn't particular to this one restaurant, but rather sizzler in general.</review><pics>None<//pics><Date>1546646955498</Date></record>

Terrible food,  terrible service! All you can eat steak and shrimp means what you get whats on your plate and that all you get to eat! No seconds on shrimp cuz your waitress is going to disappear. Leather like steaks. Have someone that knows the heimlich procedure with you cuz choking on the drizzly meat is a guarantee!
One star is more then they deserve!< /review>

<Review>I only give this 3 stars because for a shrimp dinner with baked potato, roll and a drink the bill was $51 and some change for the two of us. We used to get a one time trip to the salad bar for an extra $3.99, but they have done away with that. So, you pay for unlimited salad bar $6.50. The dessert selection was horrible, and the shrimp was very greasy. I will say that the service was excellent and the wait staff were very helpful.

<Text>So much wrong with this place.  Has a smell when you walk in.  The clam chowder had a brown film over it.  Pasta looked like it had been sitting there for hours.  Chocolate pudding had a green tint to it.  Food out of the kitchen seemed okay...but the salad bar needed a lot of attention.</Text>< gmapID>

Service was great!  Every employee was polite and professional but the quality of the food, specially in the salad bar was veeeeeery poor. All items were not fresh at all. One of the worst eating experiences I've ever had.<//Text>

My trip was during dinner time, plenty of parking, no line when we went in. We were greeted when we walked in, the woman took our order, gave us our drinks and plates (we got the salad bar ) and were told to sit where we like. The food was good no complaints but the plates we received had food stuck on them, when given a new set they also had food on them. The waitress was a little rude about the complaint,  she also vacuumed during our entire visit only stopping when someone got her attention. I don't know if I would visit this sizzle again.<//text>

A nice Sizzler, friendly and accommodating staff. Our recent visit had a couple issues like the steak was cooked not to what was ordered  (but we ate it anyway ) and the large bottle of Tabasco was missing it's inner spout so it just gushed sauce all over the soup, but we pointed it out to the server and she thanked us for pointing that out and took the bottle so it would not happen again. Overall a nice and clean restaurant and ample parking.</Text>

<Review>A nice Sizzler, friendly and accommodating staff. Our recent visit had a couple issues like the steak was cooked not to what was ordered  (but we ate it anyway ) and the large bottle of Tabasco was missing it's inner spout so it just gushed sauce all over the soup, but we pointed it out to the server and she thanked us for pointing that out and took the bottle so it would not happen again. Overall a nice and clean restaurant and ample parking.</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< username>

Had not been in many years. Used to go a lot as a kid, and few times as a teenager, but went back with the family and was disappointed.

It wasn't bad, but the price-to-awesome ratio was skewed more towards the price side of things. We spent more, and didn't get to leave with leftovers!

Taco fixings we're meh, cheap and old. At one point the soups did not at all match the labels, but then they did upon return. Out of chocolate ice cream, which made the kids sad.

Overall, not enough deliciousness to warrant the price. Could have ordered a variety of things elsewhere, left with leftovers, and still have spent the same or less. Food would have been awesome acrissed the board instead of "oh, this must been sitting awhile."

The kids had more fun at the Chinese buffet place in Grass Valley, and we spent less, and the wife and felt the overall quality was about the same.<//review>

<Text>Absolute worst meal I've ever had in my life. I paid for 2  buffets at a price 0f 30$ and what little there was out to choose from was nearly all cold( like taco fixings, mac and cheese, chicken wings things that shouldn't be). Now I noticed there weren't many people there but my family party of nearly 50 but I nearly went back to the front to ask for my money back we had maybe 3 bites between us and the waitress took our entire trays because it was literally inedible. I do have to mention they did bring out a fresh bowl of warm mac and cheese for my sister and gave us a basket of rolls which was one a price so I got one cold bite of food and one roll for 30$. This is unacceptable.< /Text>< Pictures>

Stopped by this location on the way home from Reno.   Restaurant is very clean and organized, but they seemed understaffed that morning.   Regardless, our server hustled and kept our party well stocked with salad plates and bowls and checked up on us regularly.   Food came out slowly, but still, everything was great.</Review>

I have been going here for years. It's been a favorite, however, my last visit was very disappointing. The man taking our order put more effort into second guessing us instead of listening and my entrée  wasn't edible due to the nasty canned gravy poured over it. Thank goodness for the salad bar.< /Review>

<review>It's a nice restaurant for small get togethers, it has a relaxed atmosphere with a nice aesthetic. However, the food is sub-par for a sit down restaurant, the main attraction being their salad-bar, which is an all you can eat option.<//review>< Pictures>

I feel like I just got sold a sh_tty used car. How about getting charged for a salad bar because she braved a couple of bites of truly wretched pudding. Oh and she made a taco at the buffet section which was laid out like it was for everybody. SO: $5.99 for one salad bar and $6.99 for the other one (I guess it’s a subjective/random pricing strategy)...ALSO-$3.99
for soup bar. $19.99 for a very ordinary ribeye...
$18.99 for my BLAH tri-tip (st least I think it was
tri-tip). &2.69 for coffee & $2.99 for iced tea.
All told, pre-tip the bill came to $64 and change.
And darn, I can’t even drive it home!< /review>

Food quality same as always, about a 7 on a 10 scale!

My server was very nice.

Unfortunately, girl @ the order counter was unprofessional, rude,no customer service skills.

Kind of ruins the whole dining experience</text>

Food quality same as always, about a 7 on a 10 scale!

My server was very nice.

Unfortunately, girl @ the order counter was unprofessional, rude,no customer service skills.

Kind of ruins the whole dining experience</Review>

Horrible! We came in as a party of four each ordered an entree and the salad bar. Not only did they forget my plate, but when we told them hey your missing a plate, they told me i was wrong even though we paid for it! Then they decided to add my entree as a side to some one elses plate. And when i told them about it, our server was rude! And then we ask for a manager and she did NOTHING to resolve the issue. Didnt make sense because they didnt forget my soda! Or the fact thar we were charged!  How do u see four people and completely ignore one person? I have never eaten at sizzlers before and i can guarantee the only time i will ever come again is to out buy every store just to put this outrageous store out of business or to reteach their cashiers busers and servers what friendliness and some actual class can do for them. Better yet such horrible service is bound to put themselves out of business and who knows if the food is worth it .   .I guess this is why they stay in the lower class brackets and why i never go . Complete trash ..id rather dine at home town buffet, their servers and busers have more respect! And im not a fan of their resterant either .... I guess im so suprised and angry because i have never had been told i was wrong for pointing out hey you got my soda but for got my plate and they looked at me like i was wrong? What is wrong with these people?! And the manager said it was odd they messed up and she would resolve the issue .. but i never got my full entree or to really try the soup or salad or the dessert ..but we paid for it. Totally speaking with their district manager and i will certainly never dine their and yes im thinking of calling the news station this place was that disrespectful .Any one else go to a resterant to drink soda only? And pay for food you wont eat? I didnt think so .  i guess this is why no one really recomends sizzler and reading through the reviews they need new management and servers, i would have loved to know what the food is like and so i can give a review of the food.... But hell . They were the worst place i have EVER EXPERIENCED. 330 AM IM STILL UPSET ABOUT IT. i mean i believe we at least deserve a refund?! Dont you?!</Text>

Usually go for the all-you-can eat salad bar. Wish they would switch up the variety every now & again, but other than that everything always seems to be freshly prepared/made.< /Review>
