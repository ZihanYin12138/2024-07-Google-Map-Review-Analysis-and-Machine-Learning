Fantastic service (having multiple employees working as a team made for a wonderful & speedy experience) & delicious food (my dish needed salt, but they had a great selection of hot sauce to flavor it up). Large portions & so good I ate all of my veg skillet and banana & peanut butter pancake. So good, I got a hummus bagel sandwich to go for later. The server was patient with my ordering & kept my delicious iced tea flowing. The patio is cute & dog friendly. Give them a try, you won’t be disappointed.</Text>

<text>The butter coffee was really good but the food tasted somewhat bland. We were REALLY bummed about the experience. Our waiter, he was very pleasant. Everyone else acted like we were a bother 😥< /text>< pictures>

<Text>This place was awesome!! We are dinner here and it was so delicious we came back for breakfast.  I absolutely LOVE the fact that breakfast is served until 2pm; it gave our family a chance to hike during cooler morning hours but still have breakfast items as our 1st meal. Wonderful decor, staff and indoor & outdoor seating. Vegan and vegetarian options, appropriately priced, nice sized portions and everything tastes extremely fresh. A big thumbs up and we highly recommend eating here.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Holy Ruben, best Ruben I have ever had and I have had New York deli. They cook their corned beef to perfection. The tomato and bisque soup was also great. The only reason this place falls short of 5 stars is because my partner ordered the turkey bacon wrap and it was very sub par, too much lettuce and not a great tortilla. Definitely will be back for that ruben. Also the service was great

Darn was so stoked on the lunch we came back for dinner and got the biscuits and chicken and it was good tasting but the portion I just payed for was ridiculous. It was two medium sized biscuits and barely any chicken.< /Text>

My family and I were in need of breakfast before heading back home. The Warming Hut was probably the best breakfast location I have ever been to. The environment of the restaurant was lively and extremely comforting. The aesthetic themes they chose for their walls to the cute red coffee cups really give off this warm, welcoming feeling that really compliment the cold snowy location.

The staff are amazing, they are very polite and friendly. They greeted us with smiles and made it our satisfaction their priority. All of them seemed to love their job and the manager knows exactly how to treat everyone.

I had the chorizo omelette, and my uncle had the monkey cakes. The monkey cakes were humongous and were stuffed with chocolate, bananas, and topped off with a generous amount of whipped cream. He found it perfect, but I thought there was too much chocolate and not enough cake. The chorizo omelette was delicious. The chefs behind the dish really knew what to add to make the spicy sausage even more scrumptious.</Review>

This restaurant is a complete gem in Mammoth!  We were in Mammoth last month, and again this month, and it’s our favorite place to go.  The food is comforting and deliciously prepared.  Great drinks!!  Fresh homemade soups with homemade ingredients.  A pure delight to dine there!  Joey has been our waiter on several occasions, and he welcomes his customers with his engaging personality.  Paul, the owner, is a true delight also with his welcoming personality to make everyone feel “right at home!”  They are working hard to keep their place open with all the COVID restrictions. You will NOT be sorry to dine here! Enjoy!!</Text>

This place was highly recommended by everyone. Yet we went for breakfast and it was not very exciting. Service was absolutely the worst. They were either very overworked,  or not so good at their job. Anyway, clearly this place must be good, so give it a try, but my experience was not that great.</Text>

Everything is warm at Warming Hut! The food, the atmosphere, the service was all really nice. Erica was awesome! We sat at the bar and had several servers stop in and say hi and check on us to make sure we had all we wanted. Food was perfect for a cold night. We will definitely be back!</Text>

<Text>Excellent service and good food. I’d give it 5 stars if not for the somewhat deceiving description of the Chicken and Biscuit dinner plate. The menu leads one to believe that it is a chicken pot pie, when in fact it’s biscuits smothered a chicken gravy, and to make matters worse, I only found one cube piece of chicken breast.  My girlfriend had the Sea Bass Dinner dish; however, she and I both felt that thiin the filet looked and it tasted like tilapia.  Having said that, I would return to try some of the other dishes.< /Text>< Resp>

It took around 20 mins just to order our drinks, it wasn't crowded and we still didn't get our food until at least a hour after we ordered, as they were ordering other people who got there AFTER us and what we got was underwhelming (we got soup of the day which was chicken noodle soup) literally had no noodles or chicken, so we ordered grilled cheese, that took 25 minutes. Also for this place being called The Warming Hut most the food was cold when it was given to us so, ya don't come here it is also Extremely over priced . 100% DO NOT RECOMMEND<//review>

<Review>I had their Cuban sandwich with a salad my wife had their half grilled cheese sandwich and cup of soup. All of the food was incredibly good. They make all of their food from scratch and it's a great place. The service was good too I will return here every trip to this area.< /Review><Name>Robert Brinkley<//Name><user>103663283525228830981</user>< date>

30 min wait for an overpriced sandwich ( we got the chicken pesto) that was not very good. One of the orders was wrong. The place felt like a tourist trap.<//Text>

<Text>My experience here wasn't great. The wait for a table for two at 10:30am on a Sunday was pretty short - about 10 minutes. However, it seemed the waiters/waitresses don't really work well together here because there was a lot of confusion over who had our table. It took us about 15 minutes before someone came to take our order (and that was only after having to flag someone down) and then another 20 minutes just to get our coffee. There were several tables seated after us that had their food before we even had our order taken. The waitress was very kind and gave us our drinks for free, but I was still disappointed in the amount of time I lost to waiting. The food itself was just okay. I had the veggie hash with avocado instead of egg. It was nothing special. The  hot vanilla was pretty good though.</Text></record>

<Text>Great atmosphere and friendly service are more important to me that great food but this restaurant has it all. A cozy fireplace, lots of sunshine through the plentiful windows and beautiful decor. The owner waited on me early one morning this week and was very cheerful. The short stack was great, served quickly. The Warming Hut is my new breakfast spot.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>New favorite breakfast and lunch place in town.  Food is great, employees are friendly, owner is amazing.
I went with a larger group of family and got to try most of the breakfast items.
The hashes are incredible.
The pancakes are impossibly fluffy for the altitude, and the topping selection is so fun!
Get the butter coffee, don't think twice.< /text>< time>

Don't go there if you expect friendly service, or any service at all. We were seated and then watched as our waitress waited on others-who had come in after us. We waited over 15 min. and didnt get asked if we wanted coffee or any drinks. She did stop by and gruffly said"ill be right with you" and then chatted seated and brought coffee to a couple she obviously knew. Was unpleasant and .ade us feel unwelcome. We went to Th Stove and had a lovely breakfast</review>< UserId.>

The Cuban Sandwich with sweet potato fries is my favorite thing here on the menu.  I normally don't use catsup, but I do here since they make it themselves. These place is great! Excellent service and high quality food.< /review>< Pics>

The bule berry pancakes are seriously out of this world. I came in here for a nice warm breakfast after camping out i nthe cold for a few days. When the bill came I sat there for a second and ordered another blue berry pancake because I would have regretted not eating another one before I left.</Text>

<Text>Food was Awesome!!! Service was slow. Don't go if you're in a hurry. We waited to be seated for about 30- min... the food is worth it! Love the hash combinations and the sweet potato fries.

The service was adequate.  Included in our order was a hamburger and a cheeseburger with grilled onions. When the bill arrived, we were charged an extra $3.00 for romaine and grilled onions x 2. After questioning the waitress, she removed the romaine charge but not the onions. In the future, it would be a good idea to inform the customer of the up charge when taking the order. The food was fine, but the onion charge made no sense to us. Our bill was over $75 with water only.< /Review><UserId.>103233550333851194604< /UserId.>< GmapID>

This small and intimate diner really won me over. The staff was very friendly oh, and the food was excellent. I really do think they should be charging more for this quality of food and service</text>

< Review>
I’m so, so happy I stumbled (literally) across this place while visiting Mammoth. I had a whole list of restaurants Google Map’d before arriving, without Warming Hut on the list (I must’ve missed it). Upon arriving, I was greeted with exceptional service. Multiple servers greeted and asked what drinks we’d like (a plus I feel, rather than getting nothing). We both ordered some coffee, my significant other got the Quiche Bites, and I got the Corned Beef Hash. She told me the Quiche Bites were excellent and I KNOW my hash was EXCELLENT! Some of the most tender and flavorful corned beef I’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Again, the staff was exceptional and the food is out of this world. I wish I had enough time in town to come again! I will for sure recommend to anyone in Mammoth.< /Review>

Took over 45 minutes for the staff to make three basic meals and the quality of the food was not worth the wait.

Bearded server gave us attitude when we asked for things like syrup and butter when they didn't deliver it with the pancakes. Kinda rude for no reason

Pancakes were redeeming tho. Avoid on weekends if you want fast service.< /review>

The cool thing about this place is their ability to cater to any nutritional need. You can micromanage your order and piece meal everything. Couple that with a seriously delicious pancake and you got a keto-pesca-vege-whatever Oasis in the mountains!< /text>

<review>What a great little gem of a restaurant to find. W were looking for someplace to have breakfast and stumbled onto this place. Very friendly and attentive staff and wonderful food. I had the Inyo face with serrano chilis, potatoes and their homemade sausage, My wife had their whole grain pancakes with the berry compote. Good stuff, highly recommend!!< /review>< user_name>

< review>
There are reviews stating the wait time is long. I would like to state that this restuarant is new. When you first open a business you have to work out the kinks.

I ordered an ice tea, bowl of creamy tomatoe soup with a grilled cheese and a ceaser salad. I think the tomatoe soup was probably the best tomatoe soup I have had in a long while.

Ceaser salad was done well, good homemade dressing, homemade croutons, and shredded romaine the way I like it.

The grilled cheese was on a good loaf of bread.

I really enjoy the outdoor seating and decor. Use of mason jars for glasses and nice dishwear for the food.

The owner is also very polite and you can tell she takes pride in her business and wants her customers to enjoy themselves.

If you are in town give them a chance!<//review>

Great options, all around. A little heavy on price when it came to ordering bacon 🥓 . Though the quality is certainly there :)</Text>

We were desperate out-of-towners visiting the area for less than one week.   We needed help, and needed it fast!   On Monday morning we limped in for a miracle, so we could get back on the road, safely.  Jim and Virginia took great care of us and gave us the temporary fix we needed.  We would have loved for them to permanently fix the car, as the quote was reasonable, but time was not on our side.   Professionalism, knowledge and such a willingness to help us, is such a treat in these crazy times in which we live.  Can’t imagine anyone else who could have helped us better than they did.<//review>

They make things possible where other shop can not. They eased my worries and even gave me a reasonable estimate. And as always the job was done superbly  as if nothing happened. The car was washed like new again. They did an amazing job!  I can honestly say that craftsmanship is NOT dead - I was extremely pleased with the job they did. Thank you, good job!< /Text>

Brea Auto Body was awesome!! They kept me informed on all the stages of car repair and did a great job making it look as good as new. I’m hoping I won’t need another car repair anytime soon but if I do I’m definitely sending back where it came from. Thanks Brea Auto Body!< /Text>

<Text>I just wanted to write this because my service is great. I like to go to the trails with my Jeep with my friends. However, I hit the side of my car. I looked for serval repair shops. However, a friend recommended this place for me. They gave me a way lower price then other shops were offering. As my repair was finished, I had some doubts because the price was low. I wondered if they cut any sides. Nope. Perfect. It seems as they put quality first. Thank you Brea Auto Body. You Rock.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGzhQRz5tWwaD4mvgvNq-tc6CmH3DGO_GT3cPB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<response>None< /response><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Date>1612625723672</Date><text>I recently crashed my car and like a normal person I went to my insurance. They gave me certain body shops to go to, so I did. I had 2 estimates before I heard of Brea Auto Body. Upon arriving, I was greeted with respect. Once seeing their estimate, I was a little hesitant. The other estimates from the other body shops were lower in price. However, they went through the estimate with me, explaining every step, and that's when I understood. Brea Auto Body uses genuine parts, straight from the dealer. The other body shops didn't even mention what parts were needed. And if I couldn't afford the  estimate, they would work with my budget. However, I was scared my insurance wouldn't work with them. And that's when I found out my insurance had lied to me. Brea Auto Body told me I had the right to repair my car where I decide. My insurance had told me to only go through these places. So I chose Brea Auto Body. And when I saw my car after it was repaired, I didn't regret it, knowing my car was fixed in the best possible way. Thank you for being honest the whole way through.< /text>< user_name>

I took my car in after getting rear ended. Jim was thorough in his initial estimate, unlike the collision repair shop that was contracted with the other party's insurance company that barely even glanced at my car. You could tell they take the time to do the repairs well as the whole car looked light years better than it did before I ever had the accident. They try to use OEM parts as much as possible to truly restore the car to its former state. I would highly recommend them and would definitely use their services again in the future (although I really hope I don't need to).< /text>

For a woman that is 50 years old, I have a hard time finding a body shop. As I own a Honda, I went to their website and searched for their Honda Certified Body Shops.That’s where I found Brea Auto Body. They are the best. The end result is spectacular. My car came out looking brand new.< /review>

<review>Most underappreciated body shop around. Most shops today are owned by big franchises that have a high over head and use inferior aftermarket replacement parts etc. They also are super friendly and honest , did I mention awesome quality! I know this because I work with a lot of body shops all over Orange County (vehicle graphics installer). Bring your car here , and you will thank me later!<//review>< Pics>

Very professional and and very good quality. Right from the start they informed me that they use parts directly FROM THE DEALER for the best quality possible (if possible btw). They work their way around your budget as well. Overall, it is very recommended.</Review>

I have been using this body shop ever since I got my first car and needed it repaired. I will CONTINUE to use it. It is great, and the workers are nice. They let me know every step.<//Text>

Work done on my 2019 Lexus was very good. It took almost a month to get a rear ended, but not a serious(?) damaged car. They said it's because of the delicate job with sensors and hidden devices.
While doing this extended repair work, the communication from the shop was not enough.
---------------------------------
I visited again to fix a couple of minor things. They worked promptly as a warranty service and very responsive to make calls.</text>

Jim and Virginia made me feel “at home.” Jim discussed everything with me. Jim brought me back to his computer/desk and completely gave a honest diagnosis and repair. Virginia offered cold water and paid for a UBER trip. I picked up my car on-time and looked better than the day I bought it. This body shop is to be trusted.< /text>

Brea Auto body did a fantastic job repairing my car. My car came out looking like it was never in need of a repair. 100% recommend to bring your car here if your car is in need of a repair.< /text>

Very fair and straight forward. Brea Auto Body has definitely put me in a good mood. Was told by another shop that my paint could not be matched on my truck door AFTER they already  painted it. A friend told me to go to Brea Auto Body and they worked a miracle! You cant even tell my truck was ever damaged. I am beyond grateful< /text>

I just want to say my repair and service for my car was beyond perfect. This repair shop puts quality first. Since the moment I walked in , they assisted me very well. They gave me the best options, where I was taken advantage of. My car looks brand new and I've never been happier. Thank you.<//Review>

Our family has been a customer of Brea Auto Body for over 20 years and have experienced nothing but the BEST IN THE WEST.  The recent negative reviews by some domestic terrorists also NON CUSTOMERS should have us all concerned for the safety of business owners throughout the county and state!!  These bullies are harassing multiple  businesses for no apparent reason just to bully and terrorize. Retaliation is apparent by these reviews.  The city of  Brea is also being harassed by these domestic terrorists.  Please ignore these anti woman owned business and also a minority owned business.  These false reviews lead me to believe that these bullies are competitors in the body shop industry???  Wearing masks is a good cover for their true identity!!!</review>

Virginia just because you continue to scream at people God bless you does not give you the right to act like a maniac. And God does not protect you from the coronavirus put your mask on. have some respect you're not special because you think you have a relationship with God I don't even care that you got upset it's the fact that you're not wearing your mask and you keep screaming about God as if that gives you some sort of right to violate people this has nothing to do with God I hope you go out of business today<//review>

<Text>Just picked up my car after a great job of Virginia and her team replacing my front bumper on my 2017 Honda Accord.  It's like new!  The customer service throughout from the beginning to the final return of my car was exceptional. I was given every opportunity for feedback and they even sent me home with some helpful reminders for me in the event of another accident.  I totally recommend them to anyone who is looking for the very best in a Brea auto body repair service.  It's easy to see how they've been so successful and number 1 for so many years....

I have never trusted anyone in the auto repair industry...that's UNTIL I brought my car to Brea Auto Body!!

I have taken my car their for repairs twice and I will continue to take my car there as long as they are in business! If I ever move to another state and my car needs repairs, I will drive or have my car shipped here for the repairs.

Lets start with Mark Longo. I have never trusted anyone with my car like I have trusted Mark. His knowledge and professionalism is world-class. He kept me abreast of the repairs throughout the whole process from start to finish.

If you are used to taking your car somewhere and being pressured into service, I can assure you it is not like that here. You'll never feel pressured, you'll never feel stressed, and you'll never feel as though you are being taken advantage of.

That leads me to the office staff...hands down some of the nicest most capable people I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. John gave me a ride home when I dropped the car off and was an absolute pleasure to talk with. Wendy was bright, cheerful, and professional each time she called with an update, and the owner was more than generous when I picked up my car.

Do yourself a favor and avoid the headache of taking your car anywhere else...

Brea Auto Body is the ONLY place to take your car if it needs repair work done. Period.

Thanks for the great service guys and gals! While I hope I don't need to return back with car damage anytime soon, I am happy to know that if my car is damaged, I somewhere I trust to take it for the repairs!</Text>

<text>I was a customer for a few jobs and they were doing fine.

Last time I went they gave me a form to fill out, although they had me in their computer already.  When I said no and started leaving, they didn't even try to stop me.

They lost a repeat customer over a form.  How smart is that?< /text><time>1308341808938< /time>< user>

We are comfortable with all of the vets in the practice and the staff are wonderful- I have to give special recognition to Roxanne and April- they always greet you with a smile and will make sure you have anything you need.

This is my best friend, Bugatti. He was found December 1, 2017 under a car. He had mange, scabies, ear mites, ring worm, parasites, FIV, lots of broken teeth and a couple more things. He was down to his last life. With the help of TNR, we were able to trap him and bring him to Family Dog and Cat Hospital. Dr Kwai and Dr Wallace are a God send. They had a lot of work on their hands, but now look at him! :) He still has a long road ahead of him, but nothing will knock him down. Thank you Family Dog and Cat Hospital!</text>

Just came to pick up medication for Cooper’s ear infection as well the remains of my senior dog, Milo, who just passed away.
I have to say the people working here are very kind and considerate. I’ve never felt rushed or pressured to do a procedure. I’m just realizing how much this place gives me peace of mind when it comes to my dogs.</review>

I did my research and this place is by far the best around these necks of the woods.  The are certified by the Pasadena Humane Society.  They are super nice to my fur-baby and the Vets always have informative talks with me.  I can't say enough.  I certainly love this place and enjoy my visits.</review>

<date>1419015231445</date><Text>I have a six month old kitten, Bailey, knowing that it was getting close to the time for him to be neutered I started searching around for a vet in the area to do the procedure.  I called several vets and decided on Family Dog & Cat Hospital.

Upon arriving we were greeted and placed in an exam room to fill out the necessary paperwork.  It was at this point everything went completely WRONG.  Dr. Garcia came in and presented an estimate that exceeded the prices quoted to me, in fact it had almost doubled.  He mentioned blood work (which was an option) that was never discussed with me during my initial conversation and medication which was supposed to be included in the initial pricing was now excluded.  There were other charges but I was so angry over the bait-and-switch l just collected my kitten and got the heck out of there.

I lost hours from work, my cat fasted for over hours needlessly and bonus …. he will have to go through this experience yet again.  The lack of customer service and honesty is shameful.

Their motto is "we're not only healing animals, we're helping families!".  The truth is that they don't care about your animals or your family ... just the money and if they have to trick you in order to get it well that's just fine by them.

NEVER AGAIN ………………….< /Text>< Resp>

They engage in preventive medicine as well as treating a presenting medical condition.  The practice is heavily involved in the community and provides assistance to animals from low income households.  They have my highest recommendation.</text>< pics>

<response>None</response><review>We have three dogs & two cats who are patients of Dr. Garcia's. With five pets, three of them seniors & one a puppy, we are VERY frequent flyers here.

She is very good with the animals, always offering the dogs treats when they look a little frightened. We can always get in on short notice or add on an additional patient, which is a HUGE plus. Our dogs actually seem to enjoy going in!

All of the techs are great and truly love what they do. They always treat your animals as part of the family and our animals respond to this love and affection by being on their best behavior.

This is the ONLY vet's office I've been to that can handle trimming my crazy calico Alice's claws. I have to give her Rescue Remedy, homeopathic calming drops before her appointment but she's no longer urinating or defecating in fear anymore.< /review>< Pictures>

< review>
My name is Cooper Seiler and am a good sized shepherd hound. Dr. Garcia and her team have provided me my Vet care since I was a pup. She is my favorite lady Doctor. Now, well into my senior years at almost 12, I recently came down with pancreatitis and thought I was a gonner! I never missed a meal in my life and all of a sudden I could not eat or drink. I have had a few close calls in my days, but this really topped the cake (and no, I did not eat any cake to cause my problem - we are still trying to figure that one out). Well, a long story short David, Dr. Hu, Roxanne, April, Eric, Amanda and Alex, all really went out of their way to save my life! Sorry for ever being a bad dog if you were helping me. You guys are awesome! I owe you. Love, Mr. Cooper. Ruff. 🐶< /review>

<Date>1446586038047< /Date><rate>5< /rate><review>Home away from home. My family rescues pets with special needs, and Dr Garcia and staff have provided excellent and affordable pet care. We were recommended through first grade teacher who also rescues animals, and let me assure you on Family Dog and Cat Hospital's high standards. This clean, modern, airy, friendly clinic also offers 'hospital stays' (boarding) which costs about the same as day care centers but the added perk is that your pet has a professional, licensed doctor on call, your pet gets walked twice daily across street at Library Park. And, as a special bonus, if you have your pet groomed on same day you return from travel, that day's boarding fee is waived.

While my family is allergic to cats, when one tiny kitten was trapped in a car engine and police pulled him out, Dr Garcia and crew took him in, healed him, and by third day we adopted him because he was too affectionate and adorable. Our kitty had sweetness in him but was previously covered in oil and a rawring hissy fit, but thanks to staff member Rod wearing kitty all over the clinic, this hissball of fear turned into the coolest cat, and now he's our specially buddy, Claritin and all. After kitty reached six months, he was spayed easy breezy, and we got a discount for being returning clients.

Something else........ We've also had to euthanize our elderly, dying dogs. Family Dog & Cat Hospital offers respectable, loving services. Our very old and sick dog was euthanized in our front yard, on the lawn during the morning with birds and nature, all the things our dog loved as she passed away peacefully and ethically. And in being kind people, Dr Garcia, Dave and Roxy wrapped our doggy up and carried her away. A few weeks later, our dog's remains were placed in a lovely cedar box with brass lock, her name engraved on plate, (welling up now) her paw print in plaster of Paris keepsake dish, and lock of her fur.... things I could not think to do at the time our dog was dying, but it was so comforting to receive these treasures from our dog, that it this kindness sealed the deal with our appreciation for Family Dog & Cat Hospital.

and now my cat will type the rest of his message:  "m,iijiuduydryfgfrB" which means "I love Family Dog and Cat Hospital."

PS: This is the ONLY place in town that will trim our dogs' and kitty's nails.... our pets freak out when groomed elsewhere but at least with Family Dog & Cat Hospital, it's FULL SERVICE.

PSS: Dr Garcia is A LADY, not a male vet, so perhaps previous poster is thinking of Dr White because my family was ripped off there for sure, and that was a male vet in Monrovia (not many in town). Just sayin'< /review>< pictures>

<time>1610600350048< /time><review>Purchased straight bundles from this company. The bundles are short when you unravel them and the hair is thin. I originally bought three 22in bundles which should have been enough hair for a full head weave. The owner when checking me out asked the hairstyle I was getting and specifically said it would be enough hair. Even with my hair dresser making good size spaces between the tracks I still barley had enough bundles to complete the sew in. So I had to go back and by another $100 bundle. The quality of hair is decent but the for the little bit of hair in the bundles and the price it is not worth it. I spent $400 for 4 bundles and I’m quite disappointed.< /review>< gmapID>

They say it’s human hair but it definitely isn’t! It tangles and I’m constantly brushing it. To think I tried to support a black owned business and got bad quality in return is insulting.<//Text>

I ordered a wig from this company and I wish I didn’t. The hair was short and thin. There was a delay in getting the hair. I sent multiple emails and received no response. I finally got a hold of someone and she explained the delay. Once I received the hair, I was pretty sure it wasn’t the right one. I called to let them know and they said no returns or exchanges. I sent a picture of how short the wig was and I was told it was right. I have never had an 18” loose wave wig only go to my shoulders.<//Text>

<text>I went to KMB about a month and a half ago. I bought two bundles of 14 inch Tropical Wave. BOMB! It looked so natural! I had a Half up Half Down hairstyle. I was loving the compliments! The quality of the hair is Amazing! Silky, easy to maintain, the pattern is still lasting, I am in love! I get my ponytail redone every two weeks and leave the sew in. It is so good. Cant wait to buy some longer inches!<//text>< Pictures>

Hair doesn’t feel like human hair at all. I wasted my money. I can’t reuse.

This is my second time buying Kiss my Bundles. I must say the quality is out of this world. I ended up getting my daughter the virgin Indian hair 20 inches 22 and 24. The bundles were soft and smelled clean. Once the hair was installed it didn’t shed that much and it didn’t tangle. I would definitely be buying all of my hair from Kiss my Bundles.< /Text>

It got tangled fast and it doesn’t feel like 100% human hair I’m really convinced it’s mixed with synthetic. Don’t buy here ! Go spend your money at Hair queen LA or Babydoll hair.< /Text>< response>

Kids my bundles has been my go to hair company for the last 4 years. From regular sew extensions to a full custom wig unit, their hair never fails to deliver the quality and affordability I’m looking for!!</text>

After she decided to get up and unlock the door we were so graciously allowed to enter.  Upon entry she acted as If we interrupted her whole life.  After i picked the hair i wanted,  a call was made to inquire about pricing,  as the pricing on the Web site "Is wrong" and the bundles in store are 75$ more than advertised.  Still opting to purchase , i was asked to dwnload  and sign into an app to pay because their machine doesnt take debit cards. After 25 minutes I was still waiting for her to figure it out, at which point i realized she was doing nothing. ...I left.
Thanks alot.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Very very helpful, Straight forward good work!!
I replaced my whole front suspension stock OEM needed an alignment bad!.
Corodobes tires, They put it back straight like new, I purchased a brand new set of 4 kumo tires with free alignment 👍💪.
They test drive to make sure 👍👍</Text>

Came in for a quick tire repair on my 2017 Sentra, was running multiple errands that day and fortunately when I came in their lot was pretty available so they talked to me as soon as I pulled in and I believe the main guy  happen to greet me he was in more casual clothes than the mechanics, but could tell he was knowledgeable on his pricing and gave me 2 options for premium tires or some mid shelf ones . Told him mid shelf brand, new tires let’s do 4 , and left him the keys. After about an hour ETA when I came back the car was sitting waiting for me with a new set of tires mounted and all 4 hubcaps back on (originally I came in on a spare so only had 3 hubcaps on and the 4th was in the trunk) so they located and put that 4th hubcap back on it’s the little things. And as for the brand of tires they were all season starfire brand which I’m not too familiar with but when you look up the pricing and the pricing he gave me it’s the same (he gives you a receipt with a full invoice of the cost breakdown) which says a lot on a first impression putting trust into someone to pick your tires for you . The big take away for me here was that I was really busy that day and didn’t have the time to quality check as I normally do when I take my cars into servicing and for the amount I paid and service and product I received on my car I was satisfied, the tires were brand new (34th week 2020) and priced honestly , everything was transparent and easy to understand from his invoice, and it was quick which allowed me to get thru the rest of my day confidently and safely.</Text>

It was a disappointing visit.  The tires that were offered as "used" tires were terrible. This tires should not have been offered for sale.  This is my very humble opinion<//Text>

Went to get new tires on my car before the new school year starts and got them for half the cost of what other shops quoted me. Super kind and helpful, even helped me out by checking my brakes to make sure I was good for another year of commuting. Will definitely be coming back for all my tire needs in the future!<//Review>

<review>First time customer !!!   In need of a tire patch repair on Memorial Day,  most shops were closed, talk to Joe on the phone, told him I was just a few minutes away! near closing time! I made it, he took care of the tire in a very professional way, another car pulled up right behind me, needed 4 tires change, Joe seem very mellow, not in a hurry to rush out, took cared of his customers, may I add !!! he was the only one there that I saw! Thanks Joe! you just earned another customer for any future use... I will pass on my experience from Cordobes Tires to any one that needs tire service. "Not only that" they beat other shop's pricing for a tire repair couldn't believe it "WOW" now that's a bargain! I'm sure a lot of customer's will be returning.<//review>< Rating>

<text>(Translated by Google) I compared more than a dozen tire stores on the Internet, and chose two people who have a rating of 4.7 or more to personally understand. JOE makes me feel the best, better than another 4.8 shop. Best attitude, best price, and good work. I changed 4 GOODYEAR tires at a time.

<GmapID>0x80dbd00c0270e4cf:0x8e7a93f1db56deee< /GmapID><Review>So enchanting!

I'm crazy about afternoon tea. If I could I'd have a tea party every single day!

The ladies here are simply the sweetest and have major skills in the kitchen. Everything I've ever tried here was absolutely delicious.

Maybe my man and I were on a mountain high on our most recent visit but we keep talking about our time here. And how many men do you know that are down for a tea party? I was taking a chance when I surprised him with reservations here but he loved everything nearly as much as I did.

This historic place was once a home to a gold
miner that was built in 1898. Can you imagine all the things that have gone on here?

There are hundreds of different teas to choose from and several different tea party experiences. I always go for the cottage classic because it's the most elaborate and so worth it. What you can expect is delicious seasonal soup, an assortment of finger sandwiches, scones with all sorts of toppings from jam & cream, and lots of tiny desserts! Each guest may also choose their favorite tea.

You can also purchase teas to-go both bagged or loose, gorgeous china, antique items, books, and many different types of gifts for tea lovers.

*During COVID your tea service will be in their gorgeous garden instead of in the house.<//Review><user>106447694604539697362<//user><Time>1608511561966<//Time><user_name>Ania K<//user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

One of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Julian. They have the largest selection of teas I have ever seen. They also have quite a selection of tea and kitchen related items. The building itself is quite interesting. It's an over one hundred year old rickety Victorian that is fun to roam around in and is supposedly haunted. Go stick your pinky out and pretend you're English for an hour. It's probably best to make a reservation since this place is popular.</Review>

I finally had tea here during my last stay in Julian! It was well worth it. I was lucky enough to get a walk in afternoon tea and what an pleasant experience it was. I waited about five minutes for them to setup before taking my seat. Presented with a menu and the months tea selections, I ordered the four course afternoon tea selection with bottomless tea. I had salted caramel pureh tea and something with apricot. The finger sandwiches are AMAZING! As are the scones and dressings. They're not open on Tuesday or Wednesday, but if you can catch them when they are open, they have a wide range of tea and tea related items to peruse as well.<//review>

Oh my goodness!!! So much to see and choose from inside this cottage, not just tea items. Don't forget to go upstairs. We didn't get to partake in a tea this time. We will be back. We can't wait to try some of the loose teas we purchased. Friendly staff. Many items made by hand. The Mommy and Me aprons are adorable.< /Text>

This was a quaint little cottage that was chock full of tea. They have a whole room with a large selection of loose and bagged tea. The afternoon tea was wonderful, the tea was bottomless and the sandwiches were amazing. My young daughters loved the tea with their Grandmother and parents. We will be back!</review>

<Review>A couple of years ago, I brought my mother in law and my daughters in for a lovely Victorian Christmas Tea. It was a delightful experience and my mother in law cherished the time with her granddaughters. The food is wonderfully hand-crafted and filled with special surprises.

<review>Love this little cozy tea cottage. Be sure to make reservations though. They are always accommodating but fill up fast. You can certainly make same day reservations but be sure to do it before heading up to insure a table. The staff are friendly, attentive, kind and have great suggestions for places to go and things to see in and around town. Be sure to meet the owner. She is a doll. Her food is exquisite and she doesn't mind sharing her recipes. There are also many tea items and treasures to find and purchase upstairs and down, from teacups, tea hats to baby blanket and so much more. This is a must visit place for sure.</review>< pics>

A cute little cottage that offers an impressive selection of tea lunches, tea to-go, and a huge variety of tea for purchase. I didn't eat there so not sure how it tasted but the options looked good. Minus 1star because the decor was definitely Visiting Grandma's  House and because their to-go selection was just popular brands of tea (stash, h&s, rep of tea)< /Review>

Really good tea!

It's a funny little place if you are just going to buy tea as you walk into the main tea room with a bunch of people drinking tea. But they do have a bunch of really good options.< /Review>

<Text>Imperial style cuisine has been disrespected for too long. A Brit style tea for two is delicious and it is nice that our little town has been able support this small business for over 20 years. Reservations are recommended. Also of note that they support local organizations, so lots of praise for community spirit too! Especially nice for those who like a big selection of teas and paraphernalia like cozys, tea cups and pots. I'm not an expert but I think many would call it "proper" tea service.</Text><response>None</response><Name>Brett Stalbaum</Name></record>

I can buy any tea here, including ones I have trouble finding elsewhere. There's also an adorable shop on the second floor full of everything from kitchen implements to vintage hats.

High tea here is scrumptious. The lovely ladies who work here are kind and fun, and great cooks. Worth it, especially for that low price!</text>

This place is a hidden gem! Loved everything about it. The staff is very friendly. Jen, Amy and Eedy were all so wonderful. I called ahead to make reservations and they set up our table adorably for my mother's birthday ! It felt like I was in a fairytale! The finger foods and settings are all beautiful!  Everything is made with love and care here! My mother had the best birthday ever! We will definitely be back!< /Review>

The staff seemed preoccupied and hard to catch their attention. After I finally got their attention, one of the ladies went upstairs to check on the availability of the item I was interested in and never returned to let me know what they had. I finally went up to find her and she was tidying up - apparently forgot I was waiting!< /review>

My wife and I had Valentine Day high tea (4 courses) at the Julian Tea House and it was delightful. The food and the tea were both excellent. The only draw back is that the tea room is very small but had 4 or 5 tables in it, so if you get loud or unfriendly neighbors at a nearby table everyone taking tea shares them.< /Review>

Huge selection of teas from many brands. Many tea accessories and tea service (reservation may be required). Helpful staff if you are looking for a type of flavor but do not know anything about teas. From beginners to advanced, this place will have something that you will enjoy.<//review>

The ambience and food was great.  They have the best gift shop with TONS of lovely items to look at and buy in SEVERAL nooks that you can peek in.  I bought the cutest cat cup and saucer that came in a matching beautiful box for $15...great bargain.  I highly recommend this place to everyone!!!</text>

Worked with Chris and his talent on our new phone system. He provided voice-overs for all our menus and custom music on hold. He was responsive and finished the work in a matter of hours! On top of that it was affordable and sounds great. Highly recommend for any business small or large!<//text>

I contacted Chris about doing a voice recording for a phone service he was very responsive and answered all my questions. I sent a script, and he said it would be an hour or two before I could get it back, I got my recordings in less than 30 min. great service will use again.</Text>

Great service that's reasonably priced with a surprisingly fast turn-around.  Had a few glitches in the finished product which they fixed and had sent to me within a few hours of the same day!  Would go business with again.</Review>

Our phone system desperately needed new greetings so we checked out a few companies but decided to go with Chris and ProVoiceUSA. Really happy we did, Chris was extremely responsive, the price was more than fair, and the turnaround time was much quicker than any of the other companies we were getting quoted from. We will definitely use them again in the future.< /text>

<Text>ProVoice USA is great to work with.  Extremely professional and responsive.  We could not be happier with the IVR prompts that Chris recorded for us and his ability to beat his own deadlines.  Using Chris's voice we have increased the professionalism of our phone system by 100%!!<//Text><Name>John Bailey<//Name><Rate>5</Rate><UserId.>102221795166995914146< /UserId.>< Gmap_id>

<review>Blown away by how easy and affordable it was to get an IVR prompt recorded.  Took all of 15 minutes, and sounded great the first time.   Chris will be doing all our phone system voice work from now on.< /review>< Date>

<text>Super fast turn around, great pricing, and it sounds AMAZING! Literally had my IVR recording done in about 30 minutes from initial contact to finished product. I wouldn't dream of using anyone else from this point forward. I'm developing a commercial, and guess who I plan on using for the voice over... This Guy! Provoiceusa is the ONLY way to go for voice talent!</text>< pics>

I contacted ProVoice USA and three hours later had my IVR recordings in a perfect voice and no need for revisions. I talked with other companies which were more expensive and difficult to work with. Not so here. I would highly recommend anyone looking for Voice over recordings to talk with ProVoice USA.<//Review>

Dropped of two bedside tables in like new condition to get sold. Failed to sell and when I picked them up there were multiple deep scratches on the too edge worn. Basically they displayed sharp items on them with out protection. Refused to give me a credit or any compensation for reducing their value significantly.< /Review>

A good place to look for above average resale furniture and decorative items for any room in the house.  On my visits they had very nice Asian decor, as well as more modern looking pieces.  Most everything I have seen over the years was originally purchased from higher end sources.< /Text>

Great finds at reasonable prices.
I have purchased 8 dining room chairs, two living room chairs and a coffee table in the last 4 years. I am a real snob when it comes to quality.
Thanks so much for all the great deals.<//Review>

I purchased a futon, dining room table and 4 chairs, and a rattan chair. My friend from LA also bought a painting and a coffee table. When you shop at Karen's Consignment you will find quality vintage used furniture.< /Text>

I was there for a family event. The place is well organized and run efficiently.  The food was served on time and very good for a buffet style dinner. I will save this place in my phone for a return visit.< /text>

<time>1619292691541</time><Rate>4</Rate><review>The lines are moving much faster than before. At least that is one positive came out from this pandemic. Process is smooth and proper protocols are strictly followed. However, I wish the staffs are better informed. We had an appointment and were sent back from the gate, because we didn't bring one particular document. Guess what, the next time that document was not required at all. So we just wasted few hours for misinformation and had to book another appointment at a later date. Also, if you go to a different counter, you will get a different response, as if the process depends on what the counter clark think is right. Not what the writing says on the DMV website. But, given that I am receiving my documents within two weeks and not four months, I can say that the whole process is moving faster than before.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Despite the fact you may have to wait in line for at least 20 to 30 minutes outside (while they work scanning everything), their work isn’t as bad as many reviews I have read about them. I guess we can take it more as “it all depends”. There’s a personal experience and there’s a general service of the location.

Yes, I agree that some of ladies that work on the outside scanning the people could be a little more easy when talking to people. They don’t need to be so loud and defensive. But in general, the office is keeping things organized and following the precautions required concerning COVID. They are keeping the number of people inside under a certain limit based on how many chairs available with enough space from each other. I didn’t look for hand sanitizer since I have my own.

The guy who worked on my documents and case (which was in reference to my driver license) was serious and organized while working. He worked all the details needed to help me and even if he didn’t have a big smile with big welcoming words like many people expect, he was sympathetic and thorough with everything he was working on, reading things carefully and making sure I would have all I needed worked out. I really appreciated his dedication.

The other people inside that I had to talk to were also fine. I did not have a bad experience and everything worked fine for me. Yes, it is DMV office, you gotta go there ready to spend sometime there while people work on what you need. I just don’t give five stars because of the ladies outside but other than that, the people working at this office are good and helpful.< /review>

<review>I filled out the driver's license renewal/real ID stuff online, got my documents in order, printed out the thing that said to go to appointment line, went to the DMV and the man doing temp checks said it didn't count and made me stand in the no appointment line. When I got to the front of the line, they said no more today. Wonderful experience. I would be more mad if it wasn't all completely unsurprising.

Lesson learned: if you have a printout that says you have an appointment, stand in the appointment line and don't listen to the man who doesn't even look at the printout before trying to usher you into the non appointment line.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

A lot of disrespectful women that work here, unorganized and they expect you to know what you are doing and get agitated if you forget something. I came in twice because their system was down and no one knew when it will get back up, so the line extended almost around the building with or without an appointment. I ended up finishing almost 4 hours getting my license renewed but the energy here really drains the life out of you. I understand dmv’s don’t pay there employees well but this place shows you why they have a bad reputation.</Text>

I needed license renewal plus Real ID.  Upon arriving, I was processed and left within 25 minutes  - easy peasy. Having uploaded my IDs and filling out online forms certainly helped with the process.  Congratulations DMV for a very thoughtful experience< /text>

The women working the line/entrance were extremely rude and unprofessional. I watched them first ignore a woman explaining that her husband didn't speak English then yell at her that he did speak English because he eeked out the words explaining why he needed to be there. I was then told one of my documents was insufficient for REAL ID proof of address even though it met the requirements stated online (i.e. a document from the government). It is unacceptable that the employees working the gate do not have accurate knowledge of the REAL ID requirements and are incorrectly turning people away.

Once we got past the gatekeepers from hell the experience got better with each person I interacted with. The woman who checked over my application and performed the eye test was grumpy and not very responsive to questions but at least professional. After that the woman who took my photo was kind and clear, then the man who printed out my permit was cheerful. It was an odd experience.< /review>

Great experience from the younger staff there. It seems like the older people that have been working there for years are the only ones left with an attitude. Very unhelpful especially from an older white lady thats stand outside . You get a discriminating vibe from her. She should be sheltered in place with that attitude.<//Review>

Without the two staffs seating at the entrance, our experience could have been perfect. Their attitudes made us feel that we were seriously discriminated!!!!!!

Everything everything in the DMV right now is dealt with out of the office and every staff is pretty much on the ground now. Most staff are working much more proactively than before. Staffs on the ground registering for us were very good.

However, there is no any sign outside of the office and the two staffs seating at the door are with extremely awful attitudes!!!!!! We were waiting for someone come back with solutions and we wanted to stand aside to wait. The first time we were asked to move aside, we stood right by the wall, so we moved to somewhere a bit far from the entrance. The second time we were asked to move, we moved a bit back to where the line was, because there was no one there and we didn’t want the person who were helping us to not be able to us in time. Then we were asked to move back to where we originally were, and her way of saying was like asking the criminals to stand by the wall!!!! There were other people around us who were also waiting by us, but they never pick on them. We feel seriously discriminated and this is not a proper attitude for someone to do their work!!!!!!

We wanted to ask for the way to make a complaint, but the other woman came out and tried to blame everything to us in front of everyone. The women said:” She didn’t ask you to put your hand up and against the wall.” Excuse me? Are we your criminals? Do you have the right to say such things to us? Do you know what your responsibilities are? We do our part to stay away from other as far as possible and did what you told us to do. Now we don’t even have the right to know your name and make a complaint?

Again, without these two staffs who seem to be of higher positions, our experience could have been much much better!!!!!< /text>

Worst DMV I’ve ever been to. Stood in line at 7:15 and got in at 8:00, the lady behind the counter was so rude and wouldn’t answer my questions. Told me I had to do a vehicle verification before they could start the paperwork
I went home and brought my motorcycle to the DMV, the guy who does it told me I can’t register the motorcycle in California because it’s under 7,500 miles, I asked why, he was like “that’s the rule, look it up online.” Went home with wasted time and a terrible experience. I would avoid this DMV if I were you, they are not helpful in any way.</Review>

Smooth process in getting my ticket number. Of course the computer systems continue to be slow and needing data re-entry as the system was having issues as always). The biggest stall was pictures and printing of temporary ID's. They had too many people waiting in line that they then had people wait outside again. I suppose in the grand scheme of things it wasn't AWFUL given I was in and out in and hour using the appointment line. Their data bases need to be improved, significantly.  Also, I was bummed they'd removed the mirrors for us to do a check before or pictures.<//review>

I wish they wear name tags.

Some are really helpful. I appreciate that.
But my experience with the window 18 was horrible. She was already angry even before we started conversation. She was insanely rude.
I didn’t wanna argue with her at all because I didn’t wanna waste my breath to educate her.

If she is already “not in the mood to talk” at 9:30 Am with her customers, she should find another job.
Thanks for messing up my morning and I’m deeply sorry for her anger issues. Hopefully she seeks for therapists soon before it’s too late.</review>

Not bad today without an appt.  Just make sure you have all your paperwork done b4 hand.  The covid screen which makes it a nice transition when you go inside the office. It's not crowded when you go in and it's comfortable. I was fairly shocked and pleased.</Text>

So I lost my learners permit, went into the Oakland coliseum DMV to get a new one, I did get one, I specifically asked "can I still take my behind the wheel test the time of my original permit" she said yes. I wait a two months, scheduled an appointment closest one at Hayward dmv. I got there they looked at my permit was screened and everything. Then I wait another hour for the actual test to begin, I was told I couldn't take it. That I had to wait another four months for the behind the wheel because they have "no record" of my old permit on the computers. This is complete BS. This should at least be documented somewhere, very unprofessional.< /text>

<Review>Please note: the 5 Star rating is for the second lady who helped me. She was alert, professional, fast, and just sweet as pie. She got me out if there in five minutes.
For the first lady who helped me, I'd have to say 1 Star. I'd put 0, but she might have just been having a bad day. She made very rude and LOUD remarks about how I was wasting her time for not having enough money at the time she was helping me to pay for what I needed. She was right, of course, there are others waiting who need help, but she could've at least muttered under her breath about how pathetic I am, but, c'est la vie.
I hope she's at least doing better now.

Thank you.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

***Update***

We came back on September 24th.  The difference of our experience was night and day.  We went at around 11:20 am, different ladies were processing outside, all were very helpful and pleasant!  The lady who processed our forms at the line, I forgot her name, actually knows the requirements and very helpful.  Then the other lady giving out the numbers was very good with our kids and was chatting with them while we waited outside for a seat inside.  Our kids were scared from our previous visit when they heard yelling and rudeness.  Once inside, it was fairly easy.  They have a link that you can check on the phone to see your line status.  Kudos to all you good people of DMV Hayward.  I am sorry for my previous review.  There are a handful who make you look bad and I forget to see that there are more good employees than not.  We saw the two rude ladies when we left which was around noon.

—————————————
Terrible!  Staff in front constantly yells and rude not just to us but with others who were in line and asking questions, at least the two ladies who were scanning people before entering. They should shut this down or at least investigate those rude staff and have them take classes in customer service.  I am not expecting top notch service from a DMV, but those women are simply rude and loud!  I am sure there are many who needs a job and will do a better job.  I have been in other DMVs and the staff are much more polite and at least decent with dealing with customers.  Unfortunately it is closed and this DMV is the closest to us.  We went at around noon on Tuesday, September 1st.</review>

<review>I think it might be better than pre-covid times. There are 2 lines: one for appointments and one for no appointments. I didn't have one as there were none available. We got our temperature checked as we waited in line, socially distanced. Then staff comes around to ask you what you need and registers you in their system, asks for your cell phone number so you can wait in your car until you get a text that you're next. I arrived at 8am was in and out in 44 minutes. Thank you DMV staff!< /review>< pics>

We went there earlier in the morning to get the REALID done without an appointment. There was a long line, but we were in and out in 15 minutes once we got inside the building. We spent a total of 1 hour and 15 minutes. It is way better to do this in the morning when it isn't as hot. The DMV clerks were professional and courteous. Make sure to do as much as you can online before showing up. That speeded everything up! I am giving 4 stars only because that line was wrapped around the building on ALL sides and there could be some efficient way of checking everyone before getting to the head of the line. Bring something to do while you are waiting!</Text>

<text>Went by mid day to try my luck, since not taking appointments.  Only two people outside in line!  Despite almost nobody there, still took hour and a half for my number to come up!  ( Only five numbers were ahead of me!).  The lady at window was ok person, but had to go to backroom 3 times to "See the Wizard(?)" To find out why computer only wanted to change me $40 for a years registration on my car (was tempted to accept the low bid, but life just ain't that easy dealing with the DMV! - for sure havoc would have ensued!).  Hayward DMV is better that either Oakland branch-- oh Hell no, don't get me started!
So, to sum it up, Hayward is pretty decent ( if you got 2+ hours to kill)<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Took my drivers test here a couple months back. The parking was here, not too crowded, the man at the desk was extremely polite and kept a smile on his face when we arrived early and just asked us to wait politely. Took my test with an Asian man named Oliver. Super nice and always kept a smile on his face. Was extremely polite during the test and after when he congratulated me. Laughed a bit jokingly when I missed something small but besides that, went really well. The whole staff was really nice to me in general.</Text>

I got renewed my license into Real ID. It was so quick, it took ony 20min. All staffs outside are so great & very helpful. The woman in window 3 ❤️(not sure about her name) was so sweet with nice smiling face, very helpful, entertaining and so quick. She looked for me when I was in photo area because I forgot to sign one more page. Photo lady was so quick too & let me smile to the fullest.😀 I recommend you all to visit Hayward branch. All is organised, applying safety measure with social distancing, chairs inside are all 6-7-ft distance apart. What a nice, great & a blessed Wednesday 👍< /text>

Showed up at 8:30 on a Wednesday around 35 people already in line. Made it to the door at 9:45. Once inside, people took a number for license renewals and RealID, but no line for submitting paperwork.

Staff outside were effective, but a little gruff. Inside, staff were effective, but much kinder.</review>

I went here to take the permit test and I spent 2hrs 15mins, the staff were very nice and professional. Went at 10 and it was less busy compared to when I left around 12, the lines were long all the way to the back. My advice go early</Review>

Good people. They solved my problem when DMV of my city (Fremont) turned me back twice. I wish I could direct my taxes towards Hayward for a while. I am reducing one star because the lady at the door told me that they are for their community and that I should have gone only to Fremont DMV, which I think is not fair since DMV offices do not have jurisdictions limited to their own cities.< /Review>

<text>Went with my son today to get a driver's license. When he got inside to take  a test for DL he was denied bec the staff claims that the maiden name of mother in his birth certificate is different with my son😳(???)... But of course bec maiden name means its the name of the mother when she was single and would not carry the last name of the husband and so with the son. Had to explain to them ...then to excuse their mistake, they claim that his birth cert isnt original when in fact what I had with me are both ORIGINAL docs  ( including marriage cert I showed to prove that I am the mother) secured from a foreign country and has a seal from National Statistics Office. These docs are same copies we showed to secure a passport here in USA and even showed them his passport. . DMV needs to educate their staffs in this branch bec just going thru the long line twice the same day and taking a day off from work was a lot of loss and effort from a mother who needs to work hard to provide for the family😳.</text></record>

The two times I've come to this DMV I was out in 20 min from the time that they opened! I of course show up about 50min- 1hr early to make sure I'm out quickly. I also double check that I have all the documents that I need. And I avoid Saturdays at all costs because I understand that's when everyone goes.  And therefore my transition is much quicker. For those who show up early, they double check your documents to ensure that you are not wasting your time. The staff seems to try their best to get you in and out. I appreciate that!</text>

Lines are often long and you have to visit multiple windows - all of which you have to wait for.

Every department is completely separate from each other, which only complicates getting business taken care of (for example, you cannot update your driver's license and registration at the same time, which means you could be there all day waiting to do each thing).

Though parking and entrance is handicapped accessible, they are not handicapped friendly - the chairs in the front row are marked for handicapped people, but everyone else sits in them too; and even though there are desks designed for handicapped service there is no guarantee that a disabled person will be called to that window, while the general population is still served at those desks.

The employees are a mixed bag of very friendly to very rude.

The positive here is that the parking lot appears to have more parking than the Fremont DMV, and the lines are shorter here than the Fremont location.</review>

Some of the females working the outside lines at the entrance were abrupt and projected a negative vibe. They didn't like to answer questions outside of directing you to stand in a given line. Anybody coming in who didn't know what to do would be confused and might not be given adequate assistance. However, the inside people were more helpful and guided you through the system in a more helpful tone. We came here after we booked appointments online with the Pleasanton office only to find its closed for renovation, no update online. However, one of the Hayward staff said Pleasanton opened a temporary office at Stoneridge a few weeks ago but you wouldn't know that when you picked Pleasanton to go to your appointments. Poor communication with the public. Hayward office should post up signage and delineate clear lines for customers to follow and brush up on people skills.<//review>

<Text>Horrible experience they make you wait in a line that wraps around the building then when you get to the front line they ask for the confirmation that you did the application online already of course I did do it online already but I can't find the confirmation number nobody told me I needed a confirmation number till I got to the end of the line so they made me stand next to the line and find my confirmation number when I found it I got yelled at by people in line because they thought I was cutting horrible experience I hope I never have to go back<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Seems to me they have 'upped' their personnel and efficiency. I found the stalls mostly manned and lines moved around to get things moving along. Also found the personnel making quite a bit of effort to be friendlier & efficient. Maybe i just got there on a good day, but a lot different than last time.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Poor DMV would not recommend to come here, unless you’re 100% sure how it works. Poor staff communication, sometimes they give you uncertain answers. Unadaptable to new orders. Manager is always on employee side rarely on customer’s. No work culture, absolutely empty souls. This is the worst experience.<//review>< Name>

I got my RealID but Staff were Rude and unhelpful... From door till counter desk same ruthless attitude beside One guy Steven.
Rest are Queens there and had right to scream and humiliate their servants.

They all need Customer service training before they started throwing paper work on your face.

That's just my observation. =)< /Text>

I renewed my CDL and changed it to a Real ID. In a time when we're in the midst of a pandemic coupled with a rainy day day I found the staff to be extremely helpful and courteous. Without an appointment I was in and out in record time: 1hr 15 min. The lady behind the first check-in went above and beyond to help others including myself. Kudos to the hard working staff.< /review>

Well the line was ridiculous! People really need to read the updated news on DMV!!! You need to pre-register before u go down there. If not they make u do it before you get a number to go in. Then u loose your spot online. The employees that are monitoring The lines are rude and yelling at everyone. There are a few ladies that were very nice though.</review>

I went there with my disable parents today .They use walker. they put them in regular line wrongly . after 2 hours when they called numbers and we went to window , instead of being sorry for their mistake and process our form faster, they correct the line and put them in disable people line . And we  had to wait  in this new line again too . I know sounds stupid , but they did to us today .we got out after about 2.5 hours  and passing 2 waiting line.
I WISH I COULD GIVE THEM NO STAR.</Text>

This place is either unstaffed or has very poor execution efficiency. Every time I come here, I have to spend at least 2 hours waiting and that makes me wonder if I live in a modern country or not. All the tax and processing fee in CA are five stars but only one star service.<//Review>

I had an appointment at this DMV on 16th October, 2019 at 3 pm. For a Driver’s License Test , I went a little early. I got my turn at the exact time. My work was done within one hour, I passed the written test and got none of my answers wrong.
The place very great, customer friendly, cordial staff, efficient service, prompt attendance to customers. A great place to visit for any DMV related works.</Text>

Made an appointment 2+ months ago for Saturday. Expected long line, etc., but I was pleasantly surprise that I was in and out in less than 1 hour. I was getting my real id card and driver license renewed. I even had to take a written test. The staff was friendly and efficient. Keep up the good work!< /text>

This location in my opinion is best among all nearby DMV, staff is very helpful and supporting, I took my behind the wheel here and Tiffani was my examiner she was very professional, respectful and clear with instructions, five starts for her.

PS: Sometimes it takes a little while here but i think that is because they pay full attention and listen to each personnel who walks in which is a good thing.<//Review>

I took a behind the wheel test here today. I was so worried because of all these negative comments, but the test turns out to be great. I passed the test and my examiner is respectful and professional. Glad I took the test here. Good luck to you all.</review>

The lady giving out papers and information at the front is very unprofessional.   I also know of others having a bad experience with rude personnel at this DMV.</Review>

DMV staff here actually work hard to make the process faster. See the document checklist, fill your application form online and have the confirmation code with you ready. Then the process is quicker.
Reached there at 8 AM on Saturday. There were probably 60 people ahead of me. I transferred my DL to CA, gave a written test and was out by 10 AM<//Review>

Rude staff. Dont even listen customers. Staff is just sitting there to collect their salaries. I went there 3 times for same issue. They behaved like you are animals for them. They feel themselves they are so superior just because they are sitting on chairs and we are standing in lines. Dmv should teach them manners before appointing them on duties.<//text>

<Text>It is always a long line and excessive wait time! I wouldn’t go there if I don’t have to. You’ve to wait for hrs even for a simple question, I think the CA DMVs will make theirs and public’s life easy if they hire someone who could only answer client’s questions - because who knows clients may need 1 simple question to be answered and not wait in line.< /Text>< userid>

Wish there was an alternative. In my opinion if a agency provides such poor service and is so indifferent to doing their job, the people should be allowed to control their budget and pay scales. But there is no incentive to improve. You can not go anywhere esle.<//Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>I got a letter stating my car registration via mail was not going to be accepted. And note, my registration was due in July, and I sent my payment in June. I need to go to my local DMV office with proof of insurance and a letter stating that my insurance is valid.  Sure, no problem.  I still tried to renew online and went to 3 different DMV kiosk! All said I needed to go renew at local DMV office. And to verify,  I called the DMV number and 3 different phone representitives told my that I do have to go to my local DMV office to renew my car registration.

Long story short,  they WOULD NOT let me renew my car registration! I was told that I have to wait 90 days past due before I can renew at the DMV office!! Seriously!!! And that I need to go online or go to kiosk! I already tried that,  all of them mentioned I need to go directly to the office! And if I could do it online or at a kiosk I wouldn't be here right now! Needless to say, after much back and forth,  still didn't get my tags. Had to leave my payment in the express pay box. So if I get pulled over, explain to me what I'm supposed to tell an officer!??? Unbelievable!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808f915ec5aa1e73:0xffaf3e6b0daa9476<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>This location had the friendliest, most helpful people working in a DMV I have ever experienced in my life. Seriously,  everyone made my experience a good one. Of course I know anyone could have a bad day or be surrounded by people who complain but I might just suggest considering what kind of attitude and outlook you have before going somewhere you don't look forward to. If you go in with a positive mood and look for the good you'll be delighted with the experiences you have. Even the dmv cab be magic! :)< /Review></record>

Had a good experience at the DMV in Hayward yesterday thanks to Holly who helped me process my paperwork. If it weren't for her I'd have to pay twice for my Real ID/drivers license, would have to come back for another appointment too. The woman who greeted meet initially was no help and rather rude. Luckily I got Holly to help me and she got it done for me.< /Review>

The vehicle inspector and three women who helped me try and transfer a title were 5 star people. They went above and beyond to make sure I was helped. Some even helping my dumb a** fill out forms off the clock.
Pro tip, go here around 3:45. It's much less hectic than the morning.< /Review>

I made an appointment in July, yes 3 months out, but it was worth it. Was literally out of the place in less than 20 mins. Appointment was for 9:00, didn't arrive till 9:03 was completely done by 9:20. Make sure you fill out application online before you go and take the confirmation number, it saves you so much time. I just really had to pay and take a picture. First lady I spoke with was super sweet. The other two weren't rude just not overly friendly.< /text>

<Review>One of the worst DMVs around. The people here are extremely rude. I don't understand where they're getting all these 5 star reviews from.  They fail at the very basic level of treating someone like a human being. This wasn't just my experience. I watched how they treated everyone else as well. Every time I've been here, they're extremely rude.  I go to other DMVs in the surrounding neighborhoods.  And every single one of them are better than this one and faster. I don't understand how everyone at this location can be this bad at their jobs and still have jobs. You'd be fired at any other job for talking to people like that.< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808f915ec5aa1e73:0xffaf3e6b0daa9476</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place is the worst dmv i’ve been to. They lost my medical and didn’t updated in the system and i found out when Highway patrol pulled me over. I went here today and after waiting in line for 1 hour 40 mins they told me they have no idea where is my medical and they don’t do printout so i wasted all that time just to hear that answer from the lady in front desk !!</review>

People need to stop complaining about petty stuff.  Everything is easily explained online,  bring the proper forms and documents and wait on the line.  How simple is that?  Obviously it will take awhile, do you not realize that California is one of the most populated states?</text>

It's like everyone that works here hate their job or something. They yell and treat you like you are 4 year old kid. They made the process quicker where you wait in main line but good luck after you get your number because your numbers never coming.</Text>

<Review>very rude staff. The lady at counter was so intimidating, almost shouting at each question. I was with my wife and child for real id. My wife was trying to understand the question and when i tried helping my wife with documents , the dmv lady jumped in and said no to this. Than she was asking all sort of confusing question. She her self was not clear on some documentation and instead of referring the site ( i have the docs as per details given in site), she said this cannot be do done. All this time my small child was so scared on this lady. Very bad experience. Will not suggest any person to go here with family.</Review><gmapID>0x808f915ec5aa1e73:0xffaf3e6b0daa9476<//gmapID>< UserId.>

5 star base ON my “personal experience”.
I got here at 4:30PM on a Friday. And got out at 5:00PM. the staff were friendly, I have a small chat with them and compliment them on how fast everything was. They told me afternoon is very slow and that people come here in the morning.<//review>

The staff @ dmv main counter is very unprofessional n rude . I had my dmv appointment.first of all when v reach dmv office v see a long queue and all people come and stand in a queue there comes no staff no one not even  a security guard to initiate if this queue is for walk in or appointments . After 1hour and half I reach to the entrance door then I see a board for appointments counter I ask the security person and dam he dnt knw English . Later wen I gt inside there  come a lady I asked her if I am supposed to wait here she say iam in a wrong line n send me directly to the appointments line n I find no one else n I gt my turn in a few minutes. Jus bcuz of silly misconception I had to wait in a line for about 2 hours . Finally I gt my turn fr knowledge test, so some reason my screen did nt wrk out I went to the lady @ the counter jus behind the computer desk and she ask me to come in a line inspite of knowing they are so many already waiting for the test , dt was so bad experience also I had some query regarding change of address when I tried to say something she say me did I ask u anything  , wt the heck is that. She need to learn how to talk to the clients .I also felt she was differentiating in terms of personal look .So I  think jus because of such staff the dmv process is going lengthier than expected anywhere else .
Wen I Say my experience to few of my frnds they told me Fremont location is far far better.< /text>

I spent two hours in this DMV trying to get a CA driver's license only to be told at the end that their machine cannot validate my foreign passport.

I used exactly the same passport with a valid US visa stamp to enter the US with no problem. Having to deal with inefficient and ineffective local government agencies is one of the worst experience I had in USA.

Edit: After the unpleasant experience at Hayward DMV, I went to the DMV in Redwood City which also opens on Saturday. The wait time was about the same but the staffs here were MORE RESPECTFUL to people. I could use my passport without any issue and this made me believe that Hayward DMV was either equipped with faulty machines or staffed with poorly trained personnel.</Text>

<text>You all know how long it takes for an appointment to happen, it takes like a month sometimes two months, but when you get there the staff tells you to leave and reschedule for no reason. And ofcourse they act like that because they work at the “DMV”. But this has to change. If people are nice coming in with respect, they need to respect costumers too. They need to have an approachable aura that will make people comfortable. They need to be taught the golden rule. They’re adults they should know that.</text><Name>Andrei Garcia</Name><pictures>None</pictures><time>1537370949866< /time><GmapID>0x808f915ec5aa1e73:0xffaf3e6b0daa9476</GmapID>< resp>

<Text>Worst DMV experience ever. One of the reception ladies is rude and said I cannot apply for a driver license because of one of the document. The reason was completely arbitrary and didn't make any sense. I immediately realized that this person is not worth wasting time on. I took the same documents to Pleasanton DMV, had a pleasant experience there, and got my driver license. Fact is the lady at Hayward doesn't know what she's talking about and rudely reject people based on false information. Be ware of this location, go to Pleasanton one even if it's further away.< /Text>< Pictures>

There is no beauty in this place. Only desolation and empty souls. This is the definition of sadness. Appointments are impossible to get, like three months out. So you have to go without an appointment. You will stand in line for approximately two hours, and then given the possibility to sit a few minutes on the many empty seats. That is just unnecessary punishment - and it applies to the elder, the pregnant too. Why don't they speed up the check-in phase so at least people can sit down? Once they call your number - employees will yawn with a huge open mouth in front of you, you will get absolutely no answers and will be treated like you owe them something. The fact is, all of this is completely unnecessary, it's red tape for the sake of it. What an ugly place.< /Text>

<review>Went into this DMV and was denied paperwork when getting a new drivers license that had my picture on it which other DMV’s have done for me before. Staff is rude and unprofessional but they almost always are at DMV‘s been waiting for 2 1/2 months for new drivers license today I finally got tired of waiting and called to find out what was going on and the lady from the one 800 number told me that I didn’t get my picture taken so I waited in line 3 hours at DMV, Paid for the new drivers license and then somehow didn’t get my picture taken? Not likely.. Now I get to go back to DMV and wait in line again just to have my picture taken thank you Hayward DMV<//review>< Pictures>

Not so bad. Had an appointment for 10 am, was seen at 10:03. Then a line to electronically fill out application, a few more waits for review with a real person, photo, etc. In and out in one hour. BUT never come here without an appointment. Place was packed with non-appointment people.</text>

I’ve been here for my behind-wheel-test at 9:50am. I arrived 1 hour earlier but waited for another 1 hour under the sun until my turn.
The officer spited me because there was a pedestrian who was standing in the middle of a road and crossing the two yellow line. He was so mad and kept saying I helped him break the law. What if I didn’t let the pedestrian cross and an accident might happen? I felt so uncomfortable and disrespectful.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808f915ec5aa1e73:0xffaf3e6b0daa9476<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I was in and out of there in less than an hour, no drama. I had done a renewal/RealID, had an appointment, and filled out the application online. Parking was full, but a car pulled out as I entered the lot.

Bring cash or checkbook just in case. My debit card for some reason did not work on their machine, so i had to pay cash for the fees. Get an appointment and fill out your application online if you can, and have your documents ready.

There is a separate line for appointments-only, inside the building. So if you see a line out the door this is likely for the non-appointment. Go inside to check the line for the appointments-only.</Review>

Dmv should have a years of service rule. Most of these people have been there for years and they don't care anymore. Every dmv employee should have a 5 year contract, after that replace them with new employees. Have you seen these people, some of them can barely move, i mean come on!</Review>

I was in and out for the real ID in about an hour and a half. I made an appointment online and everything went fairly smoothly. My issue was literally watching the employees yell at customers and talk down to them. I was shocked! I cannot believe they are allowed to talk to people this way. The lady at the front desk was yelling at everyone in line while  barking orders in the rudest way possible. How or why this kind of behavior is tolerated is beyond me. In any other establishment this kind of behavior would never be tolerated.<//review>

It's the DMV ... what you expect ?

only kindness given to me, clerks told me things i wasn't pleased with once, on me.

get here early (5:30m) set up wifi and have phone battery backups, for prompt service.

even appointments wait as long as campers.

had to do 2X to clear a ticket first, but until there is a better way this IS the #bestway</Review>

Would rate this place 0 stars if there was an option. Got here at 7:30A.M. without an appointment, but still waiting to be called after 3:00P.M. This DMV has the most disrespectful workers that treat everyone like they're a bunch a children. If you try to ask a simple 5 second question they interrupt you and tell you to go to the line. Who wants to wait a whole day for just a simple question? Nobody!< /text>

the lady in the dmv was extremely rude and was yelling at us. That was one of the most unprofessional act toward a customer and was saying "god damn"  at us.  They need to fire these kind of people

Edit: my experience in here was better than the last time I was there, but beware as some employees in there are not that patient.< /review>

<Text>Staff was super rude. People coming in early in morning were trying to figure out which line to stand on (they've no signs outside saying where the lines start). One elderly couple did;t know it was closed, so they grabbed on the handle and pulled it slightly.

This triggered a bossy lady inside. She walked out and started shouting at everyone: "Why does everyone come and grab the handle? Why don;t ya'll go stand on the line? We're trying to meet in there..." blah blah.

Most people don;t come to DMV everyday, so they don;t know what to do once they get there. Is it too much to ask government employees to be polite? Why do they have to be so rude at everyone? I know they've bad rap for being lazy and entitled. But I guess they're super rude as well....< /Text>< rate>

Very low performing DMV. High discrepancy with customer service due to; piss poor management of resources. I see several EEs not working, laughing, joking and simply not working. I just left Tracy DMV and this is no where near their standard of operating. There are no dedicated like a for quick swrvices, such as; license plate renewal, registration updates, etc.

This location should invest their time in studying the avg length of customers wait times. They should also do a better job of understanding customer needs and work on efficiency.</Review>

<Text>All I can say is the people who work here are very rude.
They talk to you like your stupid.
That is no way to treat people.
And customer service needs to improve. Don’t get loud just because some customers don’t have a clue where to stand or correct them in a rude tone when all they need is help.
I hope the employees here become more helpful and fix their attitude. I witnessed many elderly people and non speaking English people being mistreated.

Treat people how you want to be treated.</Text>< UserId.>

Expect your "appointment" to take 2+ hours!!! I had an 8 am appointment. Stood in a 100 person line until 8:30. Finally get to a person and they gand me a number and tell me to wait another 30 minutes. No appointment line wait is 4+ hours. Suggest moving to Canada.</text>

Needing new license plates for the state of California, I arrived here around 8:30 a.m. and there were about 30 people in line that moved steadily. I then got my vehicle inspected and returned to the front of the line for a ticket. I waited  only about 30 minutes or so and that's not bad. In Fremont I went twice, late morning, to the DMV and both times, the line was out the door and around the building. In Hayward it was much quicker. Make an appointment online if you can wait 30 days!<//text>

I came to wait in line at 8:30am (the line was out the door) and this helpful and friendly security guard who works there told me to come back around 4:00 pm before they close because he knows the lines are much shorter. He also took the time to explain how the line system works so I could make my own decision. I came back after work at 4pm, and was in and out within 30 minutes! Perfect! Quickest DMV trip ever.</Text>

Like most people, I always have a whole day free from my schedule so I can get any documentation done at the DMV. This time, the hayward DMV has me speechless about customer service and their effectiveness on their work. I hardly waited for 10 minutes. Every person knew their job and they all did it with a warm and welcoming gesture.I thought my weekend would be taken up enirely at the DMV but I got everything done including a written test (which is computerised❤️) in 45 minutes.keep up the great job guys!!< /Review>

<review>Prepare to be treated like cattle. LARGE lines no matter what day of the week. But it's a DMV so it is to be expected. Still does not excuse the unprofessional attitude.

"Just come in and get it over with". This is not the mentality I should have everytime I must come here.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Why would someone make an appointment if the person at the front is not going to honor it? Let's also add this is the most irritable, unyielding, and inappropriate person who will only speak to you like a robot and despite you explaining that you made an appointment for two services (one of which is to apply for a CA license from an out of state license) will continue to tell you it's impossible to do both of those services in the same appointment. You will calmly explain that you made the appointment for both services and did so over a month ago, and he'll continue to tell you that it's not possible. Then you'll ask to speak to a supervisor who is nicer than the person at the front but will try to tell you it's impossible to make an appointment for both an out of state license and registering a vehicle in the same appointment. You'll go ahead and pull up the online appointment system and show him it is possible so he'll reluctantly grant you your appointment (you scheduled it a month ago after all).<//Review>

Staff at the Hayward DMV aren’t helpful at all. They lost my info for my car registration twice when I traded in my car at Honda. Then they failed to send me a notice for my new car and charged me a late fee. Also wouldn’t let me do registration online because they never sent me my slip to be able to do it. These people are total idiots, beyond incompetent.<//Review>

< Review>
I came in on a Friday to take the written test. The employees there were amazing - very helpful, funny, fast, I had a very pleasant experience. However, the fact that you have to wait 2.5 hours just to get assigned a number is just HORRIBLE. The line was out the door, it took me an hour to get inside, an then another 1.5 hours in the line inside the building. It took another hour to get called, sign all the paperwork, take the test and get the permit. So it took 3.5 hours in total for a process that should take 30 minutes max. All of the windows were open, the employees worked fast, they were at max capacity and did their best to do everything as quickly as possible, there's just too many people, not enough offices, not enough business hours and not enough processes that can be done online. So, to whomever is in charge, PLEASE OPEN MORE DMV LOCATIONS, THERE IS TOO MUCH DEMAND. NOBODY SHOULD HAVE TO SPEND HALF OF THEIR DAY IN LINE INSTEAD OF AT WORK. ALL OF US DESERVE MUCH MUCH BETTER, DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT ALREADY.</Review>

<Text>Let me preface this review by saying that I absolutely despise the DMV. I hate waiting in line. I hate dealing with the bureaucracy & miserable people. And I especially hate giving them my hard earned money. Today I visited the DMV to pay a $461 registration fee that was inflated by tickets and late charges. Paying this amount of money for a red sticker is extremely frustrating and stressful. When I arrived, the appointments line was at least 40-50 people deep and out the door. I am physically disabled, and was seriously doubting my ability to stand up for 45 minutes straight or longer. Luckily, a kind woman came to the back of the line and took me to the front where I received my number. After that, I waited another 15 minutes for my number to be called. I reluctantly paid for my $461 sticker and left the Hayward DMV office after about 45 minutes in total. As I said - usually I despise everything about the DMV - but I'm hugely appreciative of the woman who helped me get past that absurd line. I wasn't expecting that kind of accommodation, and it made my experience less difficult. Thanks, Hayward DMV.< /Text>< pics>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>My husband and I came together to get our Real IDs
We chose to go to saturday and originally planned to go the last 2 hours of the day but watched the real time to see how busy. When I saw it wasnt as busy as usual we went right away.

My experience- I had prepped everything completely before coming including filling out forms online:which you HAVE to do.
First lady at the front desk seemed a little on edge. But people kept bugging her while she was ring to do other things when it wasn't even their turn. I think you have to be a certain kind of person to work at the dmv
Seconds step-the next lady at window 7 was so nice!
Photo-the gentleman was also extremely frowning and just over all great mood!
Arrived in parking lot at 10:42 done at 11:40

My husbands experience-
Over all good but something happened towards the end that want clearly explained, he ended up having to do an extra step which didn't make sense to get his temporary ID. I was given mine when I paid for everything.  He was done around 12:15 so took 30 minutes longer.

Has to use the bathroom before we let. Deeply regretted. Very dirty!

Over all we has A great experience, but can't quite give 5 stars due to mix ups, not explainin, some rudeness and gross bathroom.

I Would definitely recommend going to this location.< /Review>< Pics>

I'm new to CA. Took about 1.25 hours to get my new driver's license, including forms, eye exam, and 36 question road test. Not bad. Was happy with the technology, but curious why they still use paper quite a bit. Staff was not super kind, but what do you expect from the DMV.< /review>

I received my license renewal and I logged on the same day to make an appointment. The earliest appointments were in September after my license would be expired. I needed the Real ID so I had to go in. The DMV website said the wait time was 15 minutes in Hayward. Also online it said they had lower wait times. I had to wait 4 hours. I don’t think the DMV website is very accurate. Hayward also may be falsifying the wait time data.</Review>

<review>The ladies I had was terrible. ZERO customer service! Not sure if it’s their culture to be like that or what. They were complaining that I had too many things to process, that theyve never done it before. Well that’s why I made an appt and came in to DMV in person to get the things done! I am not even complaining about the wait time because I know how DMVs work. I was there for almost 2 hrs even though I had an appt, but that’s how DMVs are.

First time in Hayward DMV just because I was able to schedule an appt the day before. I shouldve jusr stayed with my local DMV - DALY CITY/SAN MATEO, even if I had to wait for the whole day at least they are nice.

The only nice person I encountered was the guy doing the photos, he’s 10/10 in terms of customer svc!<//review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<text>I have come to this local office a couple of times in the last year without an appointment. In all the times that I have attended this DMV I have never been forced to wait longer than about 1 hour. They work quickly at this DMV and can often surprise you with their efficiency. The only downside is that during one of my visits the lady behind the counter kept insisting that she had to run as it was the end of her shift, and that I had brought too much paperwork at the last moment. She ended up pushing me out of the door a few pieces of information short. This caught up with me later when I was pulled over by the police for an expired registration, only to explain that I had not received it in the mail. When I returned to the DMV I was told that I had to come pick up my sticker. "No one told me this!" I said. "Sorry about that!" the lady behind the counter responded abruptly. So just remember to verify everything before you finish with them.</text>< Pics>

Beware of the shyster outside luring people to his business! I went to renew my expired registration and I had to struggle to get any straight information. The crook outside was telling people they can no longer get their tags at the DMV, but have to pay some third party across the street a fee and get it right away. It's fraud, and this office seems complacent with it!

On the upside, I got there at 4pm to a line going outside. It moved surprisingly quick and I was glad I still got in before closing.</Text>

It is a hell place in here. Be there 7:30am to replace a license plates. It took almost 2 hour to get a number and it is 5 hour waiting now. It is still not done. I have 24 number ahead of me on this certain type of service. It stop calling on my type of number an hour ago or may call one and stop again. I can see all the people waiting here is lifelessness look. Only the people sit behind the counter have smile and chatting to each other. What a life to work for DMV!< /text>

These places in the Bay Area are totally jam-packed with people . There needs to be  those kiosks (like in the LA area), and more people working at this place. It makes no sense why we (the people ) pay so much for taxes and get nothing back, and pay so much for vehicle registration (and etc.) per year, but this government doesn't fix these roads or streets, or hire more people to work at these offices. Long, long lines and it's annoying having to make appointments just to do a simple thing. And why can't they give a list to everyone for all the things they need, so they don't have to come back and waste so much time for things that are so easy to get done.</Review>

These botches have been giving me the run around for months even though I have everyrhing in order. I have a letter that my license is cleared and these botches refused to acknowledge it and refused to do their own job, who will hold these public servants accountable? My livelihood depends on my license and these la-di-da botches are incompetent.</Text>

It's common sense that if you go to one of these places without an appointment, you have to wait in line!!! Also make sure you inform yourself about what you need before you go solve your issue with the DMV!! Use common sense people!!!< /Text>

The staff are rude, stupid, useless. Papers are magically official if I print them out, but otherwise are completely useless. They don't keep the papers, they just match your address and hand them back. Proof of address from a cellphone bill is okay even though I could put literally any address there at any time, but my online health insurance form is not even though it matches my card info? Alright.

Wait times are insane, they didn't tell me I would have to take a written exam to replace my ID. Take an entire day off to go here. Make an appointment.< /text>

<Text>I just moved to CA from another state and dreaded coming here due to all the horror stories I hear about ALL CA DMV offices.  The entire system is a total disgrace and has no respect for anyone's time.  I've lived in a lot of other states and I can tell you no other DMV in any other state is as bad as this.  The wait times posted online are a complete lie, add many hours to any number you see posted there.

At the Hayward office the line just to get a number wraps around the building and has everyone standing outside for hours without anywhere to even sit down!  Some worker comes out and gives you a card for filling out your application online, but then their wifi is so poor you can not even connect!  The fact that you have to stand in line just to get a number is completely idiotic, the whole purpose of handing out numbers is so that people don't have to maintain a position in line!!  At this place you will be in line for hours just to get a number and you can't even go to the bathroom or you will lose your place in  line!!  I did not even see anywhere to sit inside, just more lines and more standing once you finally make it inside.

They tell you to get an appointment to make it go faster, but appointment dates take two or more months to get!  Not just at this DMV but ALL of them in the bay area.  CA has a rule that you have to get your cars registered within 20 days of moving here, but then appointments take over 60 days.  SERIOUSLY?

CA has the worlds 5th largest economy with the highest income taxes in the country, yet their DMV is run like a third world rat hole with dumbed down employees who could care less.  Then they complain about all the people driving around with plates from other states as if they are trying to avoid paying fees.  CLUE for clueless DMV workers:  It's not about the money, it's about not wanting to take a whole freaking day off work just to stand in lines four hours trying to do some simple thing in your bureaucratic nightmare of a sad, sorry service center!!!</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Line was not a problem. I expected it but the rude ladies working there was not. I know they hate their job but so do most people.
I greeted them and said hello how are you, just trying to spread some positiveness.
They ignored me and didnt even say hi or anything. My license came to me with the wrong address on it and i asked if i can change it. They told me it doesn't matter. Um, i think it does.
They changed it on the computer but WHAT ABOUT THE LICENSE??
Nothing. No answer . They just ignore me when i asked several times.

< Review>
Scared to death of the DMV totally shocked, In and out in about 2 hours that would have been faster but most people do not bring the correct paperwork, which means instead of the process taking 3 mins per person its more like 10 mins,. Everyone was super nice and helpful, I feel for the lady that does the screening in the first line the amount of people coming in and having no back up paper work and she informs them and they pass back rude inappropriate arguing that is not going to change the rules!! Combat pay she deserves, the assist on the computers to load in your information the gentleman and ladies were on it awesome they hustled.
The lady on the first counter who was working two lines a machine, huge patience levels,. My tech was super pleasant, absolutely friendly assisted me on getting my Calif Real ID, yes bring everything and it works,.
The Picture guy embarrassed that I did not pick up anyone's name today
he is super professional he went out of his way on anyone to make them feel special.  Even if my picture comes out and I look like a monkey it does not matter as he made my day everyone did including the security guard as he greeted people with a smile and some small conversation and a friendly goodbye.

And no I was not up at the crack of dawn went in at a normal time with no appointment. Do everyone a favor have your paperwork in line, its a breeze,.bring a smile.<//Review>

<Text>Management and all of the staff very rude, lazy and not helpful at all. I had all of my information and yet I was told that they couldn't help me. I asked to the supervisor and she was very rude and nasty. I called the corporate office in Sacramento and I still haven't heard from anyone. It took everything in me to keep me from cussing her out. I will never step foot back in the Hayward DMV.<//Text>< user_name>

<Review>Been there at 8am to give a licence exam stood in the line till 2pm and then they gave me a token to wait again got my turn at 4.55pm and handover them all paper work address proof and blah blah did my eye test, picture done and paid them the fees.
At the end when it comes to take test they says sorry we do not take test after 4.30pm please come back tomorrow and follow same procedures.
They suggested to come early even before the dmv opens around 6.30am so that i can give my test before 4.30pm and that is also not a sure shot.

Everyone in the dmv is rude nobody wants to help you and will just make you stand for 5 hours and sit for another 3-4hours.

Never go here< /Review>< pictures>

I went in around 4:30pm and had one question about a form and the receptionist was incredibly rude and condescending. My question was can you correct the form if you made a mistake and then my goodness, please help this poor receptionist. For reference, she's a middle aged white woman with blonde/gray curly hair and glasses. She started spouting useless words to me, therefore confusing me. All I wanted to know was if I could correct the form. She took my form and told me to sign in all sorts of places WHEN I ALREADY KNEW THAT. Worst receptionist ever, the end.</review>

I visit the Hayward DMV several times a year it is rare to have a good experience there. FIRST IF YOU DO NOT SPEAK WRITE AND UNDERSTAND ENGLISH FLUENTLY YOU SHOULD GO TO A DIFF. DMV.  That was in caps not to yell but so it catches your attention. The two main employees at the desk that you check in at are usually the rudest most unpleasant people you may ever deal with in your life  and should change careers . If you do not speak and understand english be ready to be humiliated infront of everyone i have seen it several times and you will be punished by waiting longer. The gov. should plant under cover management in dmvs to help this kind of situation.  If you dont know how to take the test on a computer be prepared to be talked down to and told that you can not take a written test they will humiliate you and try to force you to take the computer test. You can and have the right to take a written test they just dont want you to. There are some good people that work there and some with a sense of humor. I have heard from several others as well as myself that this is the most unpleasant DMV to visit. Minus 2 stars would be best the rating I would give .Good luck .<//review>

<review>Worse place to be in even if you need to turn in a simple medical form. Workers are so angry as if they hate their own selves. Most of the workers are sitting wasting time talking to each other and not even trying to help when they nearly 200 waiting in a room with max capacity of 95.

I wish there is zero star option. The management here is a chaos and very inefficient. Staffs here are rude and unprofessional. People having appointments still have to wait for hours before they can be assigned with a staff. When it comes to fees, the staff has the absolute power to determine what you will pay based on the mood. Worst experience!< /Text>

<review>Some of the employees in DMV - Hayward are very rude, slow, bossy and ineffective. The first time I came there without appointment, so I had to wait for 4 hours on walk-in standing line. I wondered why a hundred of customers were waiting both inside and outside for DMV services, but there was only one check-in window opened and the woman who worked there was very rude, slow and bureaucratic. Finally, I could come to this window,  I said I would like to make an ID card, and I gave her my student card, my green card, my birth certificate, my social security card, my family's home lease contract, my health insurance card, and my school report which have my picture, my full name, my birthdate and my current address, she just looked carelessly and told me to go home to print my parents' marriage certificate (?) and threw out my documents. I asked if I could see a manager, she showed a black man beside her, and this employee  said the same as the woman. I need to bring my parents' marriage certificate to make my own ID (?) I did not agree with the way they treated me after I waited for 4 hours,  but nobody could help me. She also said I wasted her time to work for the other. She made me feel that she sat there to make difficult to customers and just wanted to get rid of customers. I was very upset and disappointed when DMV Hayward hired such these employees who worked irresponsibly, slowly and ineffectively and had bad attitudes to customers. The second time, I came to DMV Hayward with an advanced appointment. This time I met a different woman, I showed her all the documents that the last employee required me, but this woman just took my green card, my social security card and my school report and gave me the number GG079. That's it.  When I came into the sitting room , I saw the number on the screen GG039. And I waited for two more hours- from 1.30-3.30PM, the service just came to number GG047. It meant that in each hour they solved 4 numbers. I wondered when It would come to number GG079 (?) because they just worked until 5.00 or 6.00pm Max. In addition, I noticed many people came after me, they just had the number AA042 or FF038 and the screen also had about 5 or 6 number difference from theirs, so all gradually left but what was wrong with my number? I came back to ask the woman, but she did not review my number or explained. She shouted at me that I wasted her time and told me to keep waiting!!! I felt insulted, I came here to pay for my service, I brought the income for DMV and herself.  I did not come to ask her any favor or any free service. How could employees in DMV Hayward treat their customers like that?  Angrily, I left and never came back there.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>today I went there to take a driving license test, and it took 4,5 hours with an appointment. There was just one worker for a long time in this department. He was trying to do 3 jobs at the same time, so we waited forever.<//Review><userid>109319181398743419106</userid>< pics>

First off it takes over 1 1/2 months for an appt.  so had to come in without an appt. All I need was a official Driving Record printout that u can't get online. I have been here 2 1/2 hrs so far and not even half way done. This place is so outdated they call out your name instead of using a loud speaker. Wow this is 2018 not 1975. Where is all our tax dollars going ? Oh yeah into the military building bigger missiles. Never ever again coming here ! Also they need better security. Security guard is some old man that keeps his hands in his pockets.  Someday we are going to hear about a shooting in here cuz people are impatient. Our next Governor needs to improve this dmv problem. We pay alot for our cars, drivers lic. etc etc.  Get more automated machines and have proper employees helping with them. California is a joke !!< /Review>

The waits are not to bad if you make an appointment. If you wait in line then yes it takes a really long time. Overall not to bad, just really busy and full for the most part.</Text>

You must first stand in the no appointment line to even receive a waiting number. This took me over two hours to receive. Then when you finally do receive your number I had to wait another hour to get called to a window.
They encourage you to make an appointment online and punish those who do not, however, they fail to realize that online appointments are at least a month out. So if you need to make changes within a ten day time frame you are out of luck.
Worst experience at this DMV to date!<//review><resp>None<//resp></record>

<review>Went here for my behind the wheel test, the examiner was sooo old, she was scared that she will die every move I was making, she was holding my steering and crying that omg I’m scared, I got so exhausted of her being a kid and scared just left the steering for her to drive.... she failed me because she was scared. I think people above 40 shouldn’t be an examiner if they don’t have the guts to test a learner. Even when I was parking she was like ohh be careful and touched my steering again. She told me to go go on a green light while there was plenty of other cars infront of me, I couldn’t go through the cars, she was making me lose my mind, on a two way street she held my steering and was like omg these cars from the other side is freaking me out,,,, I got so mad and told her I’m not going to kill you obviously, I know what I’m doing. An examiner is supposed to watch and judge at the end of what we did, I don’t think they can touch, hold or control your steering. They should not make you lose concentration and get worried while driving, I think dmv should kickout those coward examiners. If I didn’t know how to drive I would never book a test. She wasted my time, after waiting all day.... it meant a lot for me to pass my test, this coward lady ruined my day. 😞😞< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>One of the worst place you can find in United States. I rode my bike here to deliver some documents to save his ass. Then I was told by a guy that bikes are not allowed in their building... No wonder why they got such an low score on Google Maps. They just want my bike to get stolen so I can buy a cheap car to suffer from their crappy service. Note that my friend passed the driving test half a year ago and still haven't got his license. That why he's here and they still can't get things done for him.</text>< Date>

Got here early, waited in line for 30min before it opened, and was out in 30min. I personally felt this was one of the more smoother experiences at a DMV. People give DMVs a bad rep because of their experiences, however it wouldn't bad if they would just do their homework like I did and brought everything that they needed beforehand. Instead I saw many people walk in with insufficient paperwork and still decided to pick a fight with the front desk they had no chance of winning, wasting the time of people behind them. EVEN PEOPLE WITH APPOINTMENTS SHOWED UP WITH NO PAPERWORK AND GOT RIGHTFULLY TURNED AWAY. Don't be these people. This is the reason DMVs are slow.< /Text>

If I could do zero stars I would. I went 3 times in the last few months with this branch being the closest to Castro Valley where I live. Bottom line, I waited 1.5-2 hours in the intiall line, each time only to be told I needed more documents, but not being told of future required documents each time I went. Ultimately they could not tell me in advance what I needed and were severely untrained regarding the documents I needed for my gender/name change. If you are queer and doing routine paperwork in the Bay Area and want the correct info and a helpful staff at a California DMV, just go straight to the San Francisco branch on Fell. Hayward DMV, you suck and need to train your employees better! Also, there was this awesome security guard in SF keeping the flow going and we were only there just over an hour. Hooray!</text>

Long queues. People are paying taxes and queues are increasing in size every month. They don't care. There are so few and inefficient DMV. They need some stupid documents. My wife doesn't have her name on any utility bills. She has spouse name on her passport. They need marriage certificate instead of the Passport for proof of address.
So much of IT in the Bay Area and the government can not really scale up to the demand. Take the taxes and do what with them ?</review>

I have been 3 times to get my DL and car registered. Every time I go they tell me I'm missing something or need to do more things. They told me to take my license plate off and give it to them before they would do anything further. I brought it in and they did not even take it from me. They did not tell me to take a test or get my picture taken for DL. I had to navigate my way from window to window. They were rude. I asked the man taking the DL picture about my tags, he yelled at me and said he only takes pictures and knows nothing about tags. I'm going to Pleasanton DMV tomorrow and hope to finally be done with this process.< /Text>

I got there at 11am waited in line to get my number so I can register for my writting test I waited for 45min in line I thought the lady in the front desk was busy helping the customers out but no when I started getting closer and closer to the front desk she had nothing but her phone out texting. did not greet me or anything she made me wait  2mins when it wasy turn to be helped... while she finishes up her text. This was very disappointing. Didn't end up leaving the department till like 2:45ish. Only good thing bout that day was I passed my test... test only took me about 30mins.< /text>< pictures>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>If I could rate this DMV a 0 I would do just that. The lines are ridiculous (out the door and around the corner). It takes over an hour just to be talked to at the front desk. Even if you make an appointment the wait will be long. Appointments that come 25 minutes before their actual time will be  bullied into sitting down and be forced out of line. If you also don't have a confirmation appointment number and/or email watch out because they will say nothing is there and either have you come back another day and/or get in the ridiculously long line.  The worst service and people you will ever come across! The wifi and handicap service is horrible.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Its not even possible to give half a star so let's make this long story short. Everyone is rude and don't actually care about you. They just work there till the days over so that's one thing straight. The other thing is that they don't even have technicians at the phone lines at all, not just for this DMV but for all dmvs .< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>(Translated by Google) The computer is always malfunctioning! Obviously there are three modification opportunities. Pressing once will tell you that the three modification opportunities are exhausted. And the attitude of individual staff here is very bad! I believe it's just a few people, because when I went there seven years ago, the staff who served me were very enthusiastic.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Good morning, I would like you to answer a question. I took the driving test and passed it, but when they were going to give me the license they told me that the work permit had to be valid for 90 days and mine had about a month left. They told me to go when the new permit arrived and it just came, but I don't know if the exam is still valid. I would like an appointment or if you can dial me. Thank you.

Buenos días, quisiera que me resolvieran una duda. Presente el examen de manejo y lo aprobé, pero cuando me iban a dar la licencia el me dijeron que el permiso de trabajo tenía que tener vigencia de 90 días y al mío le quedaba como un mes. Me dijeron que fuera cuando llegara el nuevo permiso y me acaba de llegar pero no se si todavía es válido 3l examen. Quisiera una cita o si me puden marcar. Gracias.<//Text>< Pics>

Every staff member is very kind and friendly, the work flow is fast and not messy, interlocking, showing high efficiency. It only took me forty minutes from entering the queue at 10 am (with an appointment) to pass the written test and get a temporary driver's license, much faster than I expected. thank you all.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Horrible this if I could give it less than 5 would be -5 I must say that this time I went and all the staff were super friendly but when I reached the final step when I finished my driving test and I was waiting for my driver's license paper to be driving a Chubby lady behaved so despotically with an Asian old man who did not know English yelled at him when in fact the man did not know how to use a computer he yelled a lot and made faces making fun of him and turned with the rest of the people who were formed waiting for approval to her acts incredibly, the people who were sure that such a mean act had to get out of the line to go help me and the Lord thanked me how I could feel so sorry when that arrogant woman urged people to act just as low as she, I think the DMV They should take more time to choose their staff and remember that it is a service and as a customer service they must be able to know how to treat people for that we are not animals that they will humiliate I am thinking of submitting a written complaint for inciting hatred of that woman

Horrible esto si pudiera darle menos 5 sería -5  debo decir que esta vez que fui y todo el personal era súper amable pero cuando llegue al paso final cuando termine mi examen de manejo y esperaba mi papel de permiso para conducir la mujer que estaba arendiendo una señora gordita se portó tan déspota con un ancianito asiático que no sabía Inglés le gritaba cuando en realidad el señor no sabía como usar una computadora le gritaba mucho y hacia caras burlándose de él y volteaba con el resto de la gente que estaba formada esperando aprobación a sus actos increíblemente la gente segia ese acto tan ruin tuve que salir de la fila para ir yo ayudarlo y el señor me agradeció como pudo me dio tanta pena cuando esa mujersita prepotente insito a personas aque actuaran  igual de bajo que ella yo creo que el DMV debería tomarse más el tiempo de escoger a su personal y que recuerden que es un servicio y tal como servicio al cliente tienen que ser capaz de saber tratar a la gente por que no somos animales a lo que van a humillar estoy pensando someter una queja escrita por incitación al odio de esa mujer<//Review><username>Jessica Valencia</username><date>1566694973490</date>< userid>

(Translated by Google) stupid and rude staff! They dont even know OPT! As an international student, I show my current I-20. They though its my old I-20. Can you guys understand my valid OPT status shown in page 2? I'm really drunk even if I can't understand my opt. I explain to them and disdain me. Really. I don't understand, blame me, I deal with a bunch of files all day and I don't understand opt.

<text>(Translated by Google) Today, when Hayward DMV helped my mother apply for Real ID, the Indian Juror did not know what attitude was very, very poor, the workmanship was very super slow and wasted the money of our taxpayer, and I had to do it in bed. I came to the United States for more than ten years. Once I met such a person, I still did it in the government department. I don’t know why I hired her to work. Is the government blinking?

今天我Hayward DMV帮我妈妈申请Real ID时那个印度女真是不知什么态度非常非常差，做工非常非常超级慢浪费我们报税人的钱，就躺在床上都要做呀，我来美国十几年第一次遇上这样的人还是在政府部门做的，不知为什么聘请她做工，政府是不是瞎眼👎👎👎👎👎👎<//text>< Pics>
