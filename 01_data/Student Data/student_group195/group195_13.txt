Once I abandoned having a traditional bank account with corporate banks like Wells Fargo and Citibank, I moved all of my banking needs to Speedy Cash and its partnership with Revolve (for online banking/debit purchases). I have been a customer now for several years and will never return to a “traditional” bank. Their lobby is clean and never crowded, they provide knowledgeable and efficient service, and always with a smile.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>Girls at Speedy cash are so awesome ! Michelle is always very helpful every single time I go in. Speedy cash is the way to go when you need cash. I've been to Ace Cash and they are rude to say the least. I highly recommend the Speedy cash for payday loans .

Very, very, nice people that are always willing to help you. I have been coming to this location for about 10 years and I always receive exceptional service. Karen has been a great help from the very beginning, and I"m glad to see that she has come a long way. All the girls are very nice but I have to say my favorite is Aranza. She is always assisting me and providing me with amazing service!!! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.<//Review>

What can I say?  Very easy and efficient.  I would like to mention Norma.  From on the phone to in person,  her kindness and professionalism were amazing.  Low fees as well!  This was my first time using this type of service and I've seen mixed reviews from other places on line..  There is good reason they have over four stars in their reviews.<//Text>

<text>I first met Dr Rector in 2008 when I was pregnant with my first son; 12 years and 4 boys later, Dr Rector is still taking excellent care of me! I can’t emphasize enough how important and essential chiropractic care is, not just for pain, but for overall health. In 2015 I made a conscious decision to change my lifestyle to get healthy and fit. The first step was to heal my body from the inside out, which is where Dr Rector came in. With his help I was able to lose 65lbs and my quality of life has never been better! I even went from being the participant in group fitness classes to the instructor teaching the classes. I never would have been able to get to this point without quality and consistent chiropractic care. The better you feel, the easier it is to make better decisions about what you put in your body. I will be forever grateful for all of Dr Rector’s help!< /text>< pictures>

There was almost no wait time and they limit number of patients who can be in the office at any time. I go to them because they are very effective at chiropractic care. I always feel better after seeing them. I highly recommend them.<//Text>

Dr. Bend and Dr. Rector have been taking care of my family and I for many years. We trust them to take care of us and are very receptive of our holistic views. We are extremely happy with them and always recommend them to our family and friends!< /review>

<Time>1607733659992< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>Dr. Rector and occasionally Dr. Abby, have been helping re-align my neck after a very painful pinched nerve I experienced a couple of years back. It left lasting pain in my neck and trap area and the adjustments I get every week have helped tremendously with my healing process. I no longer get migraines or tight “pins and needles” feelings in my neck. The payment plan is very affordable and so worth it, ya can’t put a price on health, and I know I will be so happy I addressed this sooner rather than later.

The front desk staff are SUPER friendly and professional and are another reason I’ve stuck around here as my main place for chiropractic care, after hopping around from chiro to chiro. I’m so happy I found you all, thank you thank you!< /review>< Pictures>

Miracle workers! This was my first visit and I was extremely happy! I was greeted by a very helpful receptionist and the services were superb. I came in with back pain and was quickly taken care of by Dr. Abby! Upon leaving I felt instant relief. Thank you Monterey Chiropractic Group!< /review>

From a walker to walking, after months of physical therapy that didn't work to getting a progressive treatment package from Dr. Rector of Monterey Chiropractic I began to see progress within a couple months and within a year walking with very little pain.
More than that, Dr. Rector and his staff treated me like family - a Brother!<//Text>

<text>I’m very pleased with the chiropractic treatment that I get from Dr. Rector. I’m so glad I started getting adjustments before I went on a 5 week trip to Europe. It kinda prepared me for the grueling walks and climbs I had to do during the trip. My neck, shoulders, back and legs did not bother me so much, just my feet!< /text>< pictures>

This is a great place!  Making an appointment is so easy, by phone or online.  The front office staff is very pleasant and helpful.  I've had to change and cancel appointments and they were always able to reschedule at a time that was convenient for me.  Wait time is at the most 5-10 min!  Just enough time to relax.  I have been going for over 3 years for maintenance and wellness.</Text>

I've always been skeptical of going to a chiropractor since some of my friends and co-workers say that sometimes what you're trying to fix ends up getting worse. I did not experience that with Brian Rector as my chiropractor. The staff is extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable at what they do. They show me graphs of my current condition and make a plan to correct my posture and spine that best utilizes my insurance plan.

The great part is the staff contacted my insurance directly to see what I can take advantage of so I don't have to pay much out of pocket. I came in with extreme stiffness in my neck, shoulders, and lower back and within a week the heavy sensation is lifted and I feel more flexible and loose. It definitely is a mood changer when your body is feeling great.

It's not a miracle where one session will cure everything. It takes time and trust that you place in your specialist.</Review>

<review>First time at a chiro and was a bit nervous. The staff and the doctor we're very friendly and professional. Office was clean. Dr. Rector made me feel comfortable and he was very personable. He made me feel that my concerns with my health and body were valid. He spent as much time as I needed so I coukd ask any questions and he spoke well on items I was not clear on for better understanding. Scheduling is quick and easy and you don't have to wait month out to be seen. You can literally call and be seen same day.<//review></record>

<text>Dr. Bend gets a 5++!  His bedside manner is amazing and he fixes me every time I visit.  He is warm and caring and does his job well.

His front desk staff needs some polishing, though.  I've worked in the field for years so I expect more than the average patient.  Some of the staff are less than welcoming.  Others promise to call with requested info but never do.  Perhaps being from the Midwest leaves me wanting in the hospitality department.</text>< Pics>

<text>This office is spectacular. Since starting a chiropractic care program, I have lost over 20 lbs. I wake up free from pain and have regained lost mobility, strength and flexibility. The KEY is that now that I am free from constant pain, I FEEL like exercising! I want to eat better. I think more clearly about my health and make more beneficial decisions. The staff is friendly and helpful. They are well trained. I couldn't have asked for a better chiropractor than Dr. Rector and Dr. Bend is a wonderful addition. This team ROCKS! If you're in any back pain, call today!< /text></record>

<Review>Dr. Rector is knowledgeable and comfortable with whatever you throw at him. My skeptic husband sees him, my toddler son sees him, and I see him. When my son has a few clumsy spills I take him in immediately and we're always seen. It's comforting :) I love the masseuse who works Friday morning, also - she's perfect and handles my chatting!</Review><resp>None</resp>< Rate>

When we moved here, I was 25 weeks pregnant. My entire pelvis had shifted and was causing me major pain. A friend told me about Monterey Chiropractic Group and I'm so happy I went in. I was out of pain and Dr. Rector was able to get my body in gear for a quick and easy labor. He now adjusts my toddler, newborn and husband. Highly recommend if you're looking for a knowledgable chiropractor trained in several different methods.< /text>

<Text>I'm coming into this as someone who didn't really 'believe in' chiropractic care. Now I think it depends on the Chiropractors, because I've been going to Dr. Rector at Monterey Chiropractic for several years now, and had multiple experiences where he's made a huge difference! Not just to ongoing neck issues, but when I mess something up on outdoorsy adventures. I'm an advocate now - at least for this Chiropractor's office ;) They're great about scheduling too, and the office team are super nice and coordinate well with me about insurance and receipts for FSA reimbursements. The team can usually fit me in the same day when I call, which is very helpful with chiro visits.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1468349027638, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words Kristin!

I used Waters Moving for 3 separate office moves over the years. You know that feeling of overwhelm when you're moving a business--especially from a downtown high rise? Well, Ken has a way of putting you at ease. They get the job done and with as little stress as possible. Love them.</text>

Waters Moving has done several projects side by side with us over several years on commercial job sites. They move out all the furniture , We install flooring and they move it back. They have always been on top of it and more professional then anyone you will find.

Just recently we had them do a home move for us out of state. It went so smooth and the service was exceptional so it turned into 3 home moves. There service is TOP NOTCH starting from the owners Ken & Paulette, Then from Sabrina in the office going above and beyond to meet the days and schedules that were good for us & Not to forget the undeniable exceptional service with a smile from the lead Foreman Alfredo and his whole crew. The Waters team went above and beyond what anyone could expect and on top of this with a smile. There employees were all very happy and polite.

Thanks again to the Waters Team for helping our family out with a smooth & perfect transition.< /Text>

This is the first time we've hired a full pack and move and let me tell you, I am never packing again! The Waters team was exceptional. They arrived on time and wore masks on both days. They had the appropriate number of people to make the packing and moving smooth and fast. They even helped out by removing some bookshelves and hardware from our walls. It was great experience and I'm glad I chose them over some of the other companies we considered.</Text>

The crew on moving day had the right amount of people doing a exceptional job and were loaded and gone by noon. After 3 days of storage our belongings arrived exactly as scheduled in Oregon with Tyler, the same driver and lead person from the very beginning. Would highly recommend Waters for any movie.< /review>< Pictures>

Each person we worked with at Waters was professional, patient with our many questions, kind, courteous, careful, focused, and knowledgeable. The three days of packing, loading and unloading went without a hitch and everyone represented Waters in a very positive way, without question.

Brandan and crew were on time, very professional and worked diligently.
Nothing broken and with effort, were able to get my Sleep Number Bed in a tight corner of my room. Waters bid was fair and reasonable by Ed.
Great job Waters and defiantly would use again.<//review>

<user_name>Linda T Cook</user_name><text>Working with Waters for our residential move from the Bay Area to the Sacramento Area has been a pleasure.  We've experienced several job-related relocation moves over the years and have worked with many moving companies;  Waters is right up there at the top of the list along with the national companies.   Their dedication and professionalism were evident from the onset in working with Ed Hernandez on the scoping & bidding process for what will end up being a two-stage move.    When the time came for "phase 1", the team was efficient, careful and very professional.   I particularly want to give shout-outs to George and Cal, who worked with us throughout the 3-day event of packing, loading and unloading.    We will definitely be calling on Waters to handle the final phase of the overall moving process!</text><Time>1593016825446<//Time>< pics>

This team is incredible. Our moving team was led by Faustino, and he is a gem. He and his team were on-time, so efficient, packed everything flawlessly and very quickly, and were overall very professional. They were able to execute a flawless out-of-state move during difficult conditions (smoke, bad air quality, and COVID). Every piece of expensive furniture arrived intact with no damage. Not a single glass or dish or lamp was damaged or broken in transit. They were professional, kind, and a pleasure to work with. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FAUSTINO AND THE REST OF THE WATERS TEAM. They made a stressful move simple and painless.</text>

Waters was totally responsive during the Covid lockdown, giving us an estimate and setting an appointment to move us. Most of our furniture had to be stored with them while we remodeled our new home, and some came to the new home. The crew, with two trucks, arrived exactly on time,  practiced social distancing and wore masks. They were friendly and efficient and had us moved in a half day.  They have subsequently moved our stored belongings to our new home, again with the same care and efficiency.

We highly recommend them.  You won’t be sorry if you hire them for your move< /text>

I have used Waters for business and residential moves and either full-service or simply moving packed boxes. The team is incredibly quick and self-sufficient. Their "take a load off, we're here to help" attitude makes for the fastest, most stress-free moving experiences I've ever had.

This company was introduced by my realtor and the arrangement of my moving was made long ago. Everything went well until I met them in person. One of the mover claimed that he saw me coughing and refused to work. They requested measuring my temperature and I did measure even by unpacking some of my boxes. The temperature was in normal range, but they seems not knowing what is the normal range. Eventually they left without moving and I was left with my boxes in my old apartment. I don’t understand what went wrong and thinking backward, I don't think they would recognize me coughing even if I really coughed since I was wearing mask and in distance to them. One suspicious thing is that I am an Asian and wearing mask might give them the wrong first impression. Wearing mask is supposed to be common in this situation and I don't think it means someone is sick. And if you think COVID that much serious, at least you need to bring your thermometer and measure it by procedure, not asking us to use our own which you don’t know how to read them. I respect your concerns about this COVID situation and would follow any necessary precautions, but I don’t think judging by one’s subjective opinion is not a reasonable thing and doesn’t give the right to ruin other’s long-planned day.</review>

< Review>
I seriously cannot say enough awesome things about Waters. From Chris in the office, to Ed coming by the house and giving us a super competitive quote, to our drivers Alfredo and David, to the 7 person crew who arrived at our house.  They were incredibly courteous, quick, efficient, clean, and VERY careful with our belongings.

I was afraid that for our out-of-state move we were sure to have some broken items. Nope!  Nothing broke.  Nothing!

I would most definitely use Waters again!  (although we’re not moving ever again 🤣)</Review>

<Text>We needed to move our household goods from the Bay area to Nevada Some friends who made a similar move recommended Waters Moving.   It was an excellent recommendation. This move included several heavy items from my workshop. Ed reviewed the entire house, garage and workshop. The estimate he prepared was reasonable.  We made a date for the move, the packing crew showed up on time and were very courteous and careful.  The next day the moving crew showed up on time and moved the household items to a large moving truck/trailer.  The crew was polite and careful with furniture, tools and boxed items. The next morning we all arrived at the destination early in the morning. The crew unloaded the truck and was done in a short time. Everything arrived in good order, nothing was damaged or broken.  The office staff was very courteous and honest. I recommend to my friends.</Text>< pics>

Waters moving and storage as always the crew was informative. Helpful and on time. They were respectful of the property. Kept all promises.

We used Waters Moving & Storage for our move. We contacted 3 other companies, and prices were comparable but two things made us go with Waters. First, the person who made our estimate clearly knew the business inside and out, from the specific requirements for our larger, delicate, and heavier pieces to the regulations that moving companies are required to follow. Second, a good friend had used Waters and was very satified with the experience.

On moving day the team arrived on time, were courteous and capable, and worked efficiently. They carefully prepared the furniture, and handled the stairs with no problems. Loading went smoothly, followed by travel, then a lunch break before unloading. Unloading went quickly, as well, and even at the end of their long day everyone on the team was still energetic and in good spirits.

I'd recommend you give them a call.<//text>

<review>Waters Moving & Storage were amazing! From the first phone call to getting the estimate to the men who moved our belongings all get 5 stars. Absolutely every body was not only nice and professional but were also engaging and patient. Price was competitive and honestly I didn't find one scratch on my furniture.

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>In searching for a mover, everything went well.  I talked to Chris, prices were competitive and made a reservation.  The reservation was conformed and the mover were there at 7am.  The movers were beyond helpful and truly amazing on a stressful day they were always cool.
Then came the problems....  The office called me saying that they wanted to check on the service provided.  What a lie!  They were calling because I was undercharged and once I got on the phone there was not a care in the world about the service provided only about getting their additional payment as they did not bill me correctly the first time and did not provide a receipt.  I find it VERY rude and disrespectful to call and lie about why you are calling.  If the bill is not correct, be honest.  I was honest and had no problem paying the correct charges.  I did not need to lie or manipulate; however, they do.  I really had an excellent experience with the booking agent and the movers, they were all professional and helpful.  The real let down, disappointment and change in my mind on the service is when I had to deal with the office.  Watch your bill, get a receipt and remember they are not always being honest!
Also, after they responded on 9/25 months later - make it very clear no one ever called to see how the move went, only to correct the billing error.  Your movers caused damage to my home  and my furniture.   Your company could care less, does not call people back and does not follow through on customer service. To date, I am still waiting for a call....</Text>< Pictures>

This company was always on time and Eddie and Alfredo walked their talk. Don't plan on ever moving again at the age of 62 but would give this company a 10 rating on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest score.<//Text>< username>

<review>Waters Moving Company is excellent.  They are fast, efficient, professional and provide the best service in moving I've ever used.  Brian, the lead of his team, and his four colleagues were so helpful and worked extremely hard, in high temperatures, never complaining or slowing down.  Anything I needed to assist in getting me moved, they provided.  They were fun to talk to and kept my stress level down.  I would definitely use this company again.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

We have used Waters many times, both for storing our furniture and for having it moved and assembled.
The movers are very professional, careful and fast. It’s a great value for the money. The office team is easy to get along with and to discuss your personal situation with.
I would highly recommend them for any moving or storage work in East Bay.<//text>

Think twice if you value your furniture.  I used Waters to get my home ready for sale.  Maybe a fluke but on the move day the Lead mover started complaining about everything and the workers were throwing my stuff into boxes with no packing.  All the promises the sales team made were ignored.  The Lead broke a collectible Mason jar and never told me or apologized.  Company made good but I got concerned about my stuff in storage. After two months I had everything returned, Waters charged me $500.00 more to return although I was quoted the same amount as pickup.  Most of my antiques and furniture was returned with some damage, one antique chair in my dining set can not be repaired.  Insurance doesn't matter when you can't replace/ repair.  Everything was covered in dirt and dust. I'm missing boxes but I can't prove it.  I can't recommend the movers- they don't care about what they do and are careless.  Sales and office staff were very nice though.< /review>

Waters is a great company. In an era where customer service is lacking, Waters goes out of it's way to make certain it's customers are satisfied. They are quick, efficient and get the job done. We have used them both for storage and moving. They are always personable, timely and I am pleased to say, a valued customer.< /Text>

Tyler and Luis took extra care with the glass-fronted display case and the antique dining table.  The stairs at my new-to-me home are kind of narrow but the two of them managed to get the furniture inside and placed where I wanted it, plus all the boxes.

< Review>
Waters Moving has moved our family on 4 occasions over the past four years. They moved my parents To a retirement community and over the past two months they moved both Mom and Dad into separate assisted living facilities. In addition th y moved my brother from the Bay Area to Chico. I cannot speak highly enough of their efficiency and friendly service from those in the office to those making the actual move. We enthusiastically recommend Waters.</Review>

The best moving experience possible.  Everyone at Waters - the office staff and the movers - are helpful, courteous, professional and hardworking!   The use of their totes instead of cardboard boxes is a definite plus.    I recommend Waters without hesitation.< /review>

Excellent communication before, during and after our move. Free totes instead of paying for cardboard boxes: what a great idea! Super happy with their service and would gladly use Waters Moving & Storage, Inc. again or recommend to anyone.</review>

<text>Called one day to see if they could be here the next to help me move.  I honestly couldn’t believe it when Tyler said they could!  I’ve worked at Title Companies years ago that used them so I thought I would call them first and I’m so glad I did!!!!  Everything was explained upfront and when the guys showed up, they were on time, very professional and got the job done faster than I thought.  Everything was labeled and put into my storage so I could easily find things.  Tyler and crew, thank you for getting the job done so I, a completely “stressed out girl” could finally relax and stop stressing!  I will use Waters Moving and Storage again for my next move!  THANK YOU<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>The move in itself was excellent! I have no complaints what so ever! The two movers Alfredo and Chris were professional and friendly! They were prompt, quick, and veer careful. I've used moving complanies several times and this was one of my better experiences. I definitely recommending Alfredo and Chris for your future move!

Our move time was scheduled  to begin at 8am. When I received a phone call a little after 7am stating they would be arriving in 30 mins, we were a bit alarmed, as we were doing some last minute packing. However, everything worked out fine.

The two movers had to walk up and down about 20-25 stairs to gather our things. They did so with ease and without complaints which was shocking. My fiancé and get winded after walking up just once.

I would definitely utilize your services in the future and recommend your company without hesitation.</text>< Pictures>

I recommend Waters for quality of service, reliability and, most importantly, fair dealing with their customers.  They have moved my business and my personal belongings, and if I move again, Waters Moving and Storage will be the company I will call.<//Review>

Make sure you have your own quiver since there aren't any. There are multiple to hang your bow and a decent amount of shade on the south half of the course. I like that the yardage is noted at each station with game rules if you want to follow. Plenty of scenarios for all skill levels as well as a couple of places to sight in. That hike up the hill sucks if you forgot something in your car but the honor code system is nice. I like that they keep the place fairly kept for being unmanned. Portable toilets available by the storage area if you need.< /Review><gmap_id>0x809afb2ba20b3a0f:0x5f82d0bfc279c038< /gmap_id>< Name>

<Text>First time.  Been wanting to go since I was 22.  Today is my 39th birthday.  Epic, enjoyed  being able to change distance at whim.  I will be back for sure.  Just got my bow in March.  Still need to try the "golf course" but it was in the 90s today and I didn't have my hiking shoes.  Thanks EDH Bowmen for a truly one of a kind archery range.< /Text>< user_name>

The course and the targets were very well maintained. There Was an explanation plaque at each Target on the course that told me exactly what to do depending on whether I was shooting target or shooting "hunting"  the entire facility was well maintained and clean. And it had bathrooms that were accessible maintained and clean. Overall a fantastically nice experience :-) :-) :-) and only five bucks for a non-member :-) :-) :-)< /text>

Seems well taken care of and I like the amount of of targets there. 28 targets on a circuit with multiple targets at most stations. There's also a 30-80 yard right in range and a couple other shorter ranges that would be good for the kids.</text>

<text>(Translated by Google) The food is delicious but in these times of pandemic they have no security all the people grab the bread tongs there were too many people being that a closed place should have limits people too close since it is a small place if the employees are friendly and bring covers mouths and gloves BUT TELL ME WHAT IS THE IDEA OF CHARGING WITH THEM AND THEN GO TO ACCESS THE BREAD WITH THE SAME GLOVES THAT I TOUCH THE MONEY LAST 15 minutes waiting
And everything is As normal as if nothing happened MOST OF THOSE WHO GO HERE ARE ADULTS PLEASE LET'S TAKE AWARENESS OF THE BEST COVID TO SOME DO NOT LIKE SO MUCH BUT TO OTHERS IT CAN BE FATAL LET US BE AWARE LET'S RESPECT LET'S TEACH EDUACTION AND MANAGE THE OWNER NOTHING IS GOING TO GIVE THEM GLOVES IF THEY DO NOT CHANGE THEM IF THEY TOUCH MONEY AND THEN TOUCH THE BREAD

(Original)
La comida es deliciosa pero en estos tiempos de pandemia no tienen ninguna seguridad toda la gente agarra las pinzas del pan había demasiada gente siendo que un lugar cerrado debería tener límites la gente demasiado cercas puesto que es un lugar chico si los empleados son amables y traen cubre bocas y guantes PERO DÍGAME CUAL ES LA IDEA DE COBRAR CON LOS MISMOS Y LUEGO IR A ACOMODAR EL PAN CON LOS MISMOS GUANTES QUE TOCO EL DINERO DURE 15 minutos esperando
Y todo es Tan normal como si nada pasara LA MAYORÍA DE LOS QUE VAN AQUÍ SON ADULTOS POR FAVOR TOMEMOS CONCIENCIA A LO MEJOR COVID A ALGUNOS NO LES DE TANTO PERO A OTROS PUEDE SER FATAL SEAMOS CONCIENTES RESPETEMOS ENSEŃEMOS LA EDUACASION Y AL DUEŃO Y GERENTE DE NADA TE SIRVE DARLES GUANTES SI ELLOS NO LOS CAMBIAN SI ELLOS TOCAN DINERO Y LUEGO TOCAN EL PAN< /text>< Resp>

Awful service. “Sandwich artist” refused to add toppings, just smashed sandwich together coming out of toaster and wrapped it up. She said it’s good on its own. There was only one other customer in the restaurant and he had already paid for his food, so it wasn’t even busy. I may live around the corner but never returning.< /Text>

There are a lot of subways near me. At least 6 closer then this one. However when am in the mood for subway, I prefer this one Because they take better care of the veggies.  Also the book is never as soggy as others. The only real problem is that they have idiots  working for time to time.</Text>

<Text>They wouldn't listen&didn't prepare our sandwiches the way we wanted them,th barely put any condiments (mayonnaise & mustard) on the sandwiches they were really dry & they didn't even give us the  right bread we ordered. I'm very disappointed. I wouldn't give any stars if I could.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>They didn't have the bread baked yet, but one type. They told me to wait an hour to get my sub. They didn't even offer discount because of their inconvenience. I was so hungry and looking forward to have subway after work. Instead, left and had a sub next door. I won't be coming back to this subway every.<//text>< Rating>

Prepaid order was prepared completely wrong. All our foot longs are separated to 6 inches, and the topping for a completely different sandwich were just put on another sandwhich that had it's own specific toppings??? Not sure if it is the location or the delivery representative, but maybe if this location would pick up their phone I could clarify where the issue came from. Thank you for ruining our night with food we can't eat now due to allergy differences. Good thing we checked the actual sandwichs instead of just reading the misleading written labels. Lmao</text>

Hey, it's a Subway!  The people who serve here are friendly, the place is well maintained and clean.  And it's close to laundry and other retail.  Grab a sandwich here you will be happy!<//Review>

Today I stop with my 4y old son to use a restroom . They say that is not a public and live the place. I told them that I will buy something and that my son have to use the restroom  asap but they kick us out. Never been  humiliated more in my life. Will never ever buy in subway for me and my famili to the rest of my life< /text>

<text>I am beside myself...I live in the neighborhood and was locked out of my apartment tonight. I waited the time out until my room mate got home at Subway. 1 1/2 hour. The short hisp anic lady tried to charge me $1 for a refill because I overstayed my welcome. I eat here 3 to 4 times a week. Notifying corporate office.< /text>< pics>

We recently visited this wine shop, based on customers' reviews and we're not disappointed at all. We had a lovely visit with the owner's son who let us sample several of his lesser-known but high-quality wines. We found some great wines that we would never have tried without his expertise and guidance. We highly recommend this place to everyone!< /Review>< Pics>

I like this winery a lot. The place was so cozy and elegant. The wines were very delicious and have a good aroma. The staff was so helpful and knowledgeable about the wines. She helped me in choosing a good wine that I could give to my brother. Aside from wine, they had also beers and whiskey.  What a marvelous place!<//text>

<Review>I must say their choice of drinks is well varied and quite impressive (especially the wines)! The staff was lovely and Helen behind the bar always makes you feel like family. She has a pretty smile that could make us more comfortable to ask for a favor.

Like every corner of this shop has a display of wine.  What really impressed me most is the taste of their very own wine that they produce. It was such heavenly.< /text>< Pictures>

A must-visit is this wine store! Plan this visit for 1-2 hours as you can sample a lot of wine! The owner calls the living room his little wine shop, and it really is. You'll talk with other wine tasters, hear stories from them, and you'll be able to sit down or stand up. His love for communicating and loving wine with people is infectious. A unforgettable experience indeed!< /review>

Lots of wine selections from every other country. There was still my all-time favorite wine available. It was difficult to find a wine like this, because it's a delicious wine. I am impressed with the completeness and goodness of their wines. I wasn't able to ask for more. Their employees strive to provide us with the best service that goes beyond our expectations. Terrific!<//Text>

Ordering this wine shop for the first time, it was all worth it. The waiter was really relaxed, decent, and attentive to me. In addition, the beers and champagne I ordered were fantastic and impressive. I like anything in your shop really much. It was lovely and it was a very nice place to stay. Oh, thank you!</Text>

This experience plays with the traditional values, improves others, and turns others on their heads. The ingredient quality is outstanding. The service has been stellar. The wine options are awesome. Without knowing something, you will not leave and you will not leave hungry. Worthy of being suggested!</text>

We stopped, and at this wine shop we had a tasting. Out of those we've sampled on the strip, they have the finest wine. Since my wife and I couldn't make up our minds on what we wanted best, we ended up biting the bullet and purchasing six special bottles. I would recommend it to anyone in search of a good wine. You have to try peach wine, which is the best one I've ever tasted, by far.<//review>

After brunch at the Brick Yard, I wanted dessert.

So my friend says, "I know a good ice cream liquor store."

It's a tiny place but with variety of selections. You will find French wines that not many places carry. The owner Rene is very friendly, simply tell him what you a are looking for and your budget then he will find the best wine for you.

This is the place if you are addicted to French wine. You'll also find good wine in decent price here!<//Text>

Customer Service and 'noblesse' is alive & well! I can echo a review that was posted by Connie O'Connor 9 mos. ago. Rob is a delight to work with over the phone . I was calling from out-of-state to order a delivery to a friend in Beverly Hills. All was handled with panache and for an amazing price! 5 stars are not enough to rate this remarkable vendor.<//text>

<Review>Robert is hands down the most knowledgeable, helpful, fun and personable Wine Vendor I've ever worked with.  He guided me through several different kinds of gift options and made ordering via phone a wonderful experience, while staying within my budget!

<rating>5< /rating><Review>(Translated by Google) A perfect place to find all the French spirits know-how in Los Angeles. René is a true enthusiast who has not forgotten his origins and who makes them known in the United States. I was happy to find champagne from Reims or Epernay, Bordeaux wine but also to discover American bourbon.

Focused on safety and beauty. The salon is clean and set up to allow clients to feel both comfortable and safe while getting their hair done. Rick is awesome. Pays attention to what is being requested and delivers an outstanding cut.</review>

I wish there was a 10 star rating!
First time ever going to a salon in general and I picked Privato because I've seen so many good ratings. They weren't lying, this salon was amazing and I can not wait to come back for a retouch!!
I had my appointment with Trish and she did an AMAZING job with dying my hair the blonde I wanted as well as the hair cut I wanted. Plus, everyone was really nice.
Thank you x100!!< /text>

I highly recommend this dude to anyone male or female. The hospitality and atmosphere is impeccable. I've never had someone take so much time and detail to make my first experience at this salon anything less than superlative! Thanks again brother, see you soon.< /review>< Name>

I am so very pleased with the professionals who work at Privato Salon. I have had my hair colored and cut by both Rick and Jeannette and now I have quite the dilemma --both are the best in town! I have seen Rick several times, and he always takes the time to ask me about what I would like in a hairstyle, and I always leave feeling like he really got me. The same is true for Jeannette. The front desk staff are courteous and professional and always offer a beverage. I am so impressed with Privato and only wish I had known about this salon sooner!<//text>

Jaime was amazing! I haven’t had the best experiences trying out salons in the past so I was a little nervous going into this haircut but Jaime was great and really took the time to listen to what I was looking for. Not only did she help me decide what cut and products I should get to help me achieve my desired look she was so friendly while doing so! I would definitely recommend Privato salon and Jaime to my friends and family and will be coming back for my future salon needs.</text>

It was my first time going to Privato and my first time with stylist Karen! The place itself is very nice inside and in a great central location. The front desk ladies are very nice and easy to talk too. The hair washing station is also very luxurious with large comfy modern chairs to relax in while a stylist washes your hair. Which is the first place I have ever been to that has different chairs than the ones used to cut hair. The stylist also offered me a drink with a wide variety of things to pick from even some champagne! I was able to show Karen a picture and some brief details and she was able to take my super long and thick hair into a lovely Kim K curly mid length haircut with long layers! I absolutely love it.
.
Karen and her assistant also took the time to answer all of my random questions about haircare and themselves. Really had a great time and I will be back for sure! 10/10 experience and well worth the money which is also a normal amount especially for having a stylist who has cut hair for 50 years work on your hair!</review>

<Text>Lisa Raper is amazing!! She is sweet, funny and has such a wonderful personality. I was referred to her by a friend Amber Ellis and this is seriously the best stylist I’ve ever had!  I’m so happy with how my hair turned out , the color and highlights are perfect, looks so natural.  She put layers in my hair and even showed me how to get the perfect beach wave hair by curling it. My overall experience was excellent, everyone there was professional and courteous. Thank you for having such a great salon!!❤️< /Text>< user>

This was my first time going to Privato Salon, and I can honestly say I’m so glad I did! My whole experience from walking into the salon till the time I left was great! This had to be one of the best salon experiences I’ve ever had. Jesse is such an amazing hairstylist, and overall she made it so comfortable for me as a client! I will definitely come back again for my next service.</Review>

I have been going to her for about 18 years.
I always get compliments on my nails.
She is the best.
I have known the owner Lisa for over 18 years as well and she has been doing my hair for about that long.
Privato is always, clean, great environment and perfect location and the girls at the front desk are also welcoming.
Great overall!< /Review><UserId.>110804090216059363646</UserId.>< rate>

Amazing! I recently moved to Bakersfield and found Lisa and Privato by doing a web search. The online reviews were great and I know why. The Staff at Privato Salon & Spa are friendly, professional and courteous. Lisa is incredible and I absolutely loved my cut and style. I received so many compliments afterwards and even as it grew out. I have long thick hair and stylists in the past hadn't given me that "feel great cut" like Lisa did. I just went back for my second cut and know I have found my new long term stylist in Bakersfield.  The Salon is clean and welcoming; a refreshing drink on your way in and several products to chose from as you leave.< /Text>

ILisa has done an excellent job making her salon completely safe. (It always has been 💁🏻‍♀️.)  All the guidelines were put into practice. I felt completely safe, comfortable, and valued.  Privato is my choice for a salon and I am so glad they are open again.</Text>

Jaime is amazing! She knows exactly how to do my hair and I never leave disappointed. I get so many compliments throughout the months on how amazing and young my hair looks. She knows what she’s doing!<//Text>

Jordan was amazing today. Great customer service skills, friendly and highly knowledgeable in styling hair, coloring hair as well doing the tape-in extensions. Beautiful and relaxing experience in the salon as well.<//review>

I have been going to Jeanette for my hair for over five years. She is an absolute magician for my hair. I always get compliments on it especially after a salon visit. I love Privato and Jeanette. The atmosphere is so friendly and the staff is always so accommodating.< /Text>

I was rather frazzled when my 6 year old daughter cut her hair and more frazzled when a lower end salon further messed it up. I googled best salon in Bakersfield and Privato came up. Now I know why.  Jordan was awesome. My daughter now has a pixie cut but she is affordable again.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.< /review>

This was my second time seeing Hope and I love her even more! I had a DIY hair failure on my part, and I left with not only having it fixed, but an even BETTER outcome than before. Hope is so skilled and knowledgeable. I trust her always! I think next time we’re going rose gold over the beautiful bright blonde she did this session.  So happy with my hair and I’ll definitely be continuing to recommend her to all my friends. 11/10!<//Review>

So glad I found Lisa Verdugo!  I love her!  I moved to Bakersfield 5 years ago and was having a problem finding someone that could get my color right.  I was driving back to Visalia every 5 weeks to go to Don Estee who had done my hair forever.  Lisa was able to fix the mess others had left me in.  The salon is very nice too!<//text>

<text>Lisa Raper is the balayage queen. Check her insta @brushedpretty to see her work . So I have been searching for  an artist that does good balayage and I happen to find her through the privato salon IG. She did what I told her to do and more (very subtle ash blonde bayalage on my asian dark hair in one sitting). Now thats a true talent .<//text>< Pictures>

The fried egg sandwich is the bomb!  The people behind the counter are completely nice.  They let me call in orders and are super quick.  Park in the KFC parking lot if there isn't any parking on Mission street.<//Text>

Love this place. It's been here since I was a kid. The owner is such a sweet lady and the rest of the staff are too. They always greet you with such kindness when you walk in. The food there is hella good. I love the special chicken and rice plate they have. They also serve breakfast and lunch and donuts :) plus it's right in front of a bus stop and opens at 5:30am<//Text>

<Text>Came to visit a friend that lives near by, from Vegas. I looked around for coffee and found this place. I almost don't come because the website and the menu pictures didn't make sense. But thankfully my friend has come here before, it's one of her favorite shops! I had the everything bagel with and oats milk ice coffee! It was delicious!! Plus the service was great! Super friendly!!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Tuesday we stopped by for coffee and a cappuccino and I believe that is the best cappuccino I've had outside of Italy.  There is no espresso bean, it's a mix of beans and they have a perfect mixture for espresso.  When you get that right, the rest is easier.  The whipped milk was much richer, thicker and beautiful than the average cup elsewhere.  It was not only worth it's cost, but the taste stayed in my mouth for more than 30 minutes.  All I can say is, "Wow!  Thank you."< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Adorable little coffee shop. The coffee was OK but nothing to write home about and I doubt that their baked goods are fresh but I didn't ask. Still a sweet little place to grab coffee.</review>

<text>My wife and I went to get tested for covid-19. The video consultation was quick and friendly. They were able to get us in the very next morning. The staff was pleasant, efficient and prompt. We were the 23rd vehicle in line(most vehicles had multiple people inside) and we were tested in under an hour. We also received our results in approximately 2 hours (both negative). All in all the experience was much better than we expected it to be.<//text>< Rating>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>It would have been quick to get a covid test and when they finally were able to get to us, the test itself was quick and easy.   The NP that took care of us was pleasant and explained the procedure well.  We ended up having to wait about 30 minutes because the car before us had some issues and a child that was uncooperative (not the tester’s fault).   Overall a good experience.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I had an appointment for a COVID test listed at between 11 - 12. I got to the Urgent Care at 11:05 and there was one car ahead of me waiting. No sign of Urgent Care staff or a note saying they were running late. It was at 11:45 when we were checked in and then waited another 15 minutes. When they came out to test us it was over in a flash. A little more communication would have been appreciated.
However, I’m very happy to get my test. They are still hard to come by.< /text>

IUC gave me a wrong COVID test for travel on 5/8.  We called non-stop for an hour with no answer, I had to rush to San Jose Airport for testing again, they charged $170 (vs. $238), result by 2pm the next day with a copy of CLIA cert.  I posted my review and got a call saying that he is so sorry, that he will refund my charges.  I told him that I already took another test, please refund me and call my sister who hasn’t gotten a new test yet.  He called back 3 hours later, claiming that the test was the right one, they just messed up the paperwork.  So he “fixed” the paperwork to indicated PCR was done, (but the CLIA number on the report was not correct).  Then he refused my refund claiming that the test and paperwork were correct.  I have already disputed with my credit card.  Anyone needing a PCR test for overseas travel please google COVID test San Jose airport.  They are cheaper, they know what they are doing, totally professional!  If you read the reviews, this is not the first time they have given antigen test instead of PCR!

I needed a RT-PCR COVID test for travel, this was communicated during telemedicine with a doctor.  The wording for test result provided only said “RAPID SARS COV 2 AG, QL IA...”. No mention of RT-PCR, NAAT, or RNA, keywords accepted by the airline.  At this point, the airline is rejecting the test result.  We tried to called the office to get help, but there’s no answer.  I need the test for traveling on Monday.  This is totally unacceptable, I would like to give 0 star, but that’s not an option.<//Review>

Video appointment was scheduled super fast.  Video appointment they were super helpful answered all my questions and schedule my COVID 19 appointment.  Appointment went as scheduled and the nurse was super gentle and the test was not scary at all.  Got my results in 2 hours!!!  Would totally recommend this place to everyone.  Than you</text>

< review>
I had the most pleasant, non-evasive experience at Urgent Care, and I highly recommend this wonderful place to any one seeking treatment and r a COVID-19 test. I realized they do a saliva swab test that is more in-depth, not intrusive, and the nurses are genuinely caring. That me later when you come visit.< /review>

The nurse who administered the test was extremely polite and very friendly. The process was streamlined and easy. Yes, there was a wait, but these are the times we live in and it’s of no fault of the staff who are working so hard.< /review>

The healthcare workers remained helpful, kind and patient despite clearly being so busy - Which can be hard to do! :) They answered all questions and were very kind through everything. Would definitely go again :)< /Review>

<Text>They have you make a set appointment then send you an email telling you to show up within an hour window of that time. I was second car in line. I waited 15 min. Before anyone checked me in, then they verified my ID. Then waited another 25 min. For someone to come out. It was like they got 10 cars parked before they came out and tested anyone. I’ve had several covid test because I am a essential worker, this is the first time they stuck the Q-tip up my nose and twisted it into the membrane over and over and over again in both nostrils. It hurt like hell. When I’ve had it done before they just swab around the inside of the nostril did not hurt or bring tears to my eyes like this one. I would not recommend “Urgent Test Care” for your rapid Covid test.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fcb874c008c23:0x86291a6c21e5e4ea< /Gmap_id></record>

This was a relatively painless process to get a rapid test. First was an online screening with a doctor which went very well. The test itself was very quick with very little wait time. I highly recommend this process<//text>

Took a rapid covid test. The virtual visit provider joined 40 minutes later than our scheduled time. For the rapid test, had to wait in drive thru line for 1 hour. One parking attendant and one professional for taking swabs were catering to all the cars. I understand this is peak covid time, but adding more staff would definitely help move things faster.

They did call me in 4 hours to let me know my result. I appreciate it.<//review>

The PA who did my telemedicine visit was curt and did not want me to have a rapid test. She finally agreed to it and said I would be sent a appointment notice within a few minutes. Never happened, I had to schedule another telemedicine appointment and after sending two messages through the portal someone call and reprimanded me for making an additional appointment. She said the system programmed my phone number in wrong and that’s why I didn’t get the appointment for the rapid test. I finally got one today. While in my car I noticed that the staff performing the tests don’t change their gloves between patients. This seems like a great way to spread Covid. Still waiting for the results.<//Text>

Well organized fast intake. Still slow in delivery of covid 19 tests. Up to 5 days or more. While that is not really their fault as I do not believe they are running the test themselves but rather sending it out to the big labs to do it. Fact check me on this

We need to get the 15 minute check out to the public. I do not look forward to days of not knowing.</text>

Lining up on the busy street with cars expecting to drive in the lane I was stopped in waiting for COVID was extremely dangerous. I was waiting for a car to plough into the back of my car. It was a terrible location- no room to wait safely or park easily and only two individuals testing. It took forever.</review>

< Review>
We need to do Covid-19 PCR tests for travel and had to meet doctors through telemedicine for each family member separately. However, the doctor made a mistake and ordered rapid test for one of us. We found it out after receiving an appointment confirmation text. We called them immediately for correction. They said it was changed to PCR.

Today we went there on time. There was a long line: only one technician was talking samples. The parking lot was tiny, making it even slower. We had to wait for over 2 hours. When the technician came to us, we found one of our family members was still rapid test. They didn't make correction when we called two weeks ago. They cannot make corrections today. The rapid test is not acceptable for the destination we will travel.

Highly recommend, they are open weekend's too.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This Urgent care provided fake information to the patent. I have never had appointment or care provided on 12/8/2020. But my medical record from Urgent care shows that they provided me telemedicine care on this day. And they referred me take Amoxillin 500mg and Ibuprofen while i have no sickness symptoms.
They are doing their jobs so wrong< /Review>

I came here for covid testing 10/21/20, not very busy at 2pm. The woman who did my covid nasal swab was super sweet and super gentle. I’ve been terrified to get tested but it was nothing like I thought it would be. She talked me through everything and had me do breathing exercises during the swab which honestly helped a lot. I wish I knew her name, but I can’t thank her enough for making my experience a good one!<//Review>

Had an online appointment within 2 hours of calling with a great kind Dr Matt. Referred me next day to their office drive in and stayed in my car. Took about 40 minutes wait I did not mind at all. Felt so badly for the women doing the testing in the upper 80’s in their PPE sweating. Test really quick. Thank you all so much for the great customer service, and special thanks for the first responders.< /review>

Awesome service and the people were so kind. However, it was very disorganized and no sense of a line whatsoever. Luckily I got there before the rush so I was helped quickly, but when I left there was a huge line blocking the street when there were tons of open spots to park so people could be tested. Very poor signage and a very noticeable lack of organization. However still a good experience for me and I am very thankful to the people doing this work. However, management needs to be doing a better job.<//Text>

<Review>Highly recommend for COVID testing!! You have to have a video conference with a doctor before you can schedule a COVID test, but there were same day video appointments available, and the call was about 5-7 mins. I needed a rapid test done within the next two days (I completely dropped the ball on scheduling one earlier, so was panicking a little!) The doc was able to get me an appointment for a test the next day in Santa Clara (about 40 mins from me, since the closer clinic was closed on the weekends. But hey, I was fine to drive a little extra if they could get me in on such short notice!). Once the doc ordered the test, I was sent a 2 hour window in which to show up to the clinic for my test. I highly recommend getting there as early as possible in your window (maybe even a little earlier!). The way that the staff handled the drive-up testing was extremely organized and efficient, and everyone was very kind! JUST BE PREPARED TO: 1) wait in a line of cars for a bit, as they move folks into parking spots as earlier cars leave; and 2) wait a little bit more once you are parked (bring some work tO do!) I was in and out in exactly 1 hour, which I will absolutely not complain about. The line looked a little longer as I was leaving, so I imagine the Alesia could be potentially longer than that. But hey, it was nothing compared to some of the nightmare waits I know others have experienced. THANK YOU SO MUCH, INSTANT UC!!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The site where I was tested was a small center but the staff there arranged the incoming and outgoing traffic very well and my wait for the test was shorter than I expected.  I would have given IUC five stars if my experience getting registered for the test hadn't been so darn tedious and getting in touch with anyone to assist you with that hadn't been difficult also.</review>

I like the services they offer at instant urgent care. They offer you simple lab exams in the office, to better solve minor health problems you might have at the appointment. The facilities are clean, organized and well equipped. My primary care is within the group and I really like her job. She's knowledgeable, courteous, attentive to details and she really listens and offer advice to patients.< /Review>

I had a noon appointment and arrived around 1120am. The website didn't mention the testing would be done outside. It did mention over the phone after I had made the appointment to see a doctor via web but I couldn't access that at home. Once I arrived I was greeted and all my information was taking and I was told to downloaded the app to be seen prior to testing. I waited in my car for a provider to speak with me for almost half an hour. I had things to do and unfortunately the testing wasn't going to begin until 1pm. I stayed on the app GG or another 30 minutes after leaving their parking lot. So I was never seen via the app. I was called a little after 1pm to get me with a provider, but I had an appointment I couldn't miss. I had them cancel my appointment. Maybe I a I shouldn't go around lunch time. I will go to the free pop up testing sites tomorrow.< /Text>

3 workers had to handle a back up of about 80 cars today. I waited in line for two hours. This is more a reflection on the the infrastructure of the COVId response in California than it does of this urgent care location.< /review>

If you want your result, go somewhere else. Better be prepared for the test results.  8 days and counting, no result yet. Wouldn't recommend.</review>

<review>If you need testing done for Covid -19 please go else where. My husband and myself were promised test results in 4 days. It’s been almost two weeks and still no results or phone call. We have called and emailed and no one has gotten back to either of us. The most irritating thing is that the doctor told us that the testing is free, but we received a rather large bill in the mail. It’s pretty convenient that they can get the bill out faster than our results.. Very disappointed with our experience, do yourself a favor and don’t waste your time.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

I had the best experience! First of all, I had no trouble setting up a same-day telemedicine call and the physician was phenomenal. Receiving my covid test at the drive-through, the staff were extremely kind, professional and thoughtful. Highly suggest getting a covid test with instant urgent care.<//text>

<Text>First time visitor to this clinic and the service was exceptional. I called prior and the front desk was very helpful in answering my health insurance questions. Dr. Stanley Ma, was quick to diagnose my health issues, which turned out to be a severe sinus infection along with asthma related symptoms.  Prescriptions were called in and filled promptly. I was able to pick those up and take the antibiotocs immediately to alleviate the symptoms. All in all, I definitely highly recommend this clinic.< /Text>< Name>

13 DAYS ago, I was tested here for COVID-19 and I still don't have my results back. I have called every phone number I can find, trying multiple options and leaving voicemails. I have sent a message in the online Athena Health portal. I check that portal every day, multiple times per day. No one has returned any of my calls or messages. Do NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION FOR COVID-19 TESTING!!!!!< /Text>

Bunch of incompetent doctors... they can’t treat even common cold. My entire family fell sick. Please don’t go to this place. I have been there thrice all three times they didn’t treat well. I ended up going to other doctors. There is no option to give 0 rating. Please consider rating as 1 minus 1.</text>

<review>The last thing I want to do is to complain about front line workers and this is not a complain about the worker just how disorganized their system is. No one answers calls and no way of emailing anyone. I was supposed to get my Covid-19 test result in 3 days and I’m on the 8th days and no result.
Nurse got back to me on wed that they’re doing the last test and I should have the result the next day. I’m still waiting. If you need to get your result in a timely manner I suggest you go somewhere else and save yourself from the headache of chasing them. The lab that they work with is the problem.

Update: today is the 8th days and still no response and no one is updating me on my result. I'm sure it does not matter bc they charge my insurance anyhow.<//review></record>

The staff is really friendly, and when I went in yesterday with cold symptoms I was literally seen within 10 minutes of getting there.

Although Beacon is a 20 minute drive from my house, they are completely worth it. Thanks, Beacon!

My mom needed a checkup for a bad sore throat and rashes. The staff was  very courteous. Dr Mathew put my mom at ease immediately and she insisted I write the review right away :). She is much better now thanks to their kind attention. I recommend the place to anyone looking for immediate care (or otherwise). I didn’t have to wait at all after I booked the appointment.<//Review>

<Text>The lobby wasn’t the cleanest, maybe because it was the long weekend!  Staff were polite. I was taken in about 15 mins after my appointment time. The doctor on duty was friendly. Suggested I do a related test at their other location. Overall a reasonably good experience. Will know better once my problem gets resolved.<//Text>< pics>

This time was different with a different provider. They wanted to do a rapid flu even though I had zero symptoms other than a stuffy nose. I felt I was an attempt to add a test because the girl at the front desk had told me IF a test is needed it would be an extra 59.00. Then all the sudden I need another test. I said no thank you. It is not the flu. It is a sinus infection. Smh. The provider got mad apparently because she slammed the door as she left. If I have to see that provider again I will not return. Unprofessional. Otherwise they are great.<//review>

Great staff, very helpful, knowledgeable, caring, relatively quick and great bedside manner. I have come here twice now for X-rays regarding possibly broken bones. The first visit we tested the area and it looked pretty bad so we took an X-ray. The second time, the Doctor (Charlie?) tested the area and it didn't really look like I needed one, so I went home with some good advice on how to take care of it and recover. I am happy to avoid expenses and radiation if I can help it!
And his advice was just what I needed. On the mend, no problems.

I am a fairly active guy, and between motorcycling and martial arts I am sure I will be visiting Beacon again at some point down the road.</review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>The doctor here should be embarrassed of her work. All my wife and I needed was for her to perform a physical and sign off on a bill of health for our adoption process. My wife and I had to come back twice each (to different locations) for no reason other than to be billed.  We were also billed out of pocket for the initial visit because “they didn’t take insurance for a physical”. Only to find out after we paid cash they they absolutely do take insurance. There was nothing that could not have been done over the phone (outside the physical). Never coming back here again. I wish I had gone elsewhere.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Staffs and Dr are very kind. I'm so glad to find this place.

My son injured from skateboarding today (Sunday afternoon). Some reason my son's health insurance will start back tomorrow, however we don't want to go Vally hopital even we have insurance because it will be long waiting time.
We googled and found some urgent centers.
First we went Active urgent, Hamilton Ave around West gate shopping center. They told us it will cost minimum $200 to check in, it will cost total $400 to stitch my son's chin.
It wasn't bad to compare to gong emergency.
My son wanted to check other place and we came to "Beacon". First of all, we really felt that staffs were so kind. It wasn't long waiting and cost was very reasonable, we also saved $$.
All Staffs are so friendly. Thank you for working on Sunday.</Review><gmap_id>0x808fcb874c008c23:0x86291a6c21e5e4ea</gmap_id>< rate>

Went in today for back pain. Made an appointment online for about 2 hours later. Got there before my appointment time and was helped as soon as I walked in. The doctor, the nurse & the front office lady were great. Walked out of there in a short amount of time with the necessary prescriptions. Very quick. Thank you for your professionalism.</Review>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Coming here was a waste of time. I came straight here after a car accident, was quickly taken by very nice staff. The doctor that saw me did none of the tests that should be done to someone who had just been in a wreck—no concussion examination, no X-ray, no real recommendation for an X-ray or treatment. Save yourself some time and go straight to the emergency room. I gave it three starts for pleasant staff and clean facilities.< /review><Response>None< /Response></record>

Top notch care and exceptionally clean facility! I called beforehand for a same day appointment. When I arrived I quickly filled out only 2 pages for their information. Doctor was very knowledgeable, efficient and friendly. If I need medical care again (I was visiting from Southern California) I will definitely return here.< /Review>

<Text>Great place. I was in and out, with stitches put in, in under 40 minutes.  Staff was very friendly and they all had a great sense of humor.  I hope I dont have to go back but I will definitely keep this place in mind next time anyone or myself gets injured.</Text>< Pics>

Stopped in to get a TB test for work, they saw me right away. All of the staff, from the front desk to the doctor was very friendly and kind! And it was 1/3 the cost of other facilities I contacted! Would definitely return!!! 👏👏👏</Review>

<review>I showed up late almost 7 o'clock they took me in and took care of the paperwork and short order at  Front desk.  I can't remember the receptionist /medical tech name but very  Friendly rifled through the forms chit chatted about KD of the Warriors going down  Shes a real multitasker.
The nurse took care of the preliminaries weight hieght and blood pressure and pulse   professionally and made me feel at ease.
Oh then Dr Dalizue came in and diagnosed like Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. .
All in all if I was the boss on undercover boss .They all would be going to Hawaii for a month long vacation.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate><Date>1560222921772</Date></record></dataset><record>

This place used to be Beacon Urgent care and it seems Instant Urgent care has taken over. Beacon Urgent care used to be such a great place but I visited Instant Urgent care first time few days back and experience was really bad. Pathetic, everything. For example: Beacon used to have X-ray there but these guys dont have and so they asked to get X-Ray done outside. I did that next day one place outside and they sent the report to Instant Urgent care. When I called to check if they received the report and if doctor has seen it, they asked us to visit (and pay office visit) to find out what doctor has to say. Seriously? That explained to me why they dont keep XRay machine there. When I asked this to the front desk, she was just rude. I will never go back to this place again.< /Text>

I came in with nausea and vomiting on a Tuesday afternoon. There were 2 people ahead of me and although I threw up several times in the lobby I had to wait almost 2 hours to be seen. The MA and PA were great! They were very friendly and knowledgeable but ended up sending me to the ER due to severe dehydration, they did not give me IV fluids there which was surprising because they have before. Instead I received medication for nausea and a cup of water.
The front desk staff and medical team are good but the wait was horrible, I should have just gone straight to the emergency room :-(<//text>

I received treatment and was very happy with their performance.  I am working from out of town.  Went here because they took my insurance.  However, I would go back for the service.  Professional, clean, quick, personable.  Got results of bloodwork back the same day and they called me, pronto, to discuss.</text>

I fell off my bike and went to see if I needed to get stitches. I arrived a few minutes before they closed but they were still kind enough to see me and were very friendly. Turns out I did need stitches and they did a great job patching me up. They had to stay much later than the closing time and I am very thankful that they did. Dr. Blackshear and Joshua Ebarb (hope I got their names right) were great. I hope you don't have to go to Urgent Care, but if you do, I recommend this place.</Text>

<Review>Appointment means nothing! It took ~ 40 mins to get back to the room to be seen. Entire apt took over 2.5hrs to be given Gatorade, despite patient being pregnant and as such should have been a priority. The PA who saw us  was not knowledgeable and had a terrible bed side manner. The medical assistant was the most helpful and seemed more informed than the PA. Will never be back here again. If it was an option would have not given any star.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<time>1473536730495<//time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>They were covered by my insurance.  Got some labs done.  Many things went wrong.

1.  Doctor didn't use gloves when drawing blood.
2.  Doctor didn't believe me when I said my veins move.
3.  Doctor proceeded to stick and needle and dig around in my right arm, trying to find the vein. Ow.
4.  Couldn't find the vein in the right arm, period.
5.  Doctor proceeded to stick and needle the left arm.  Ow, again.
6.  Doctor referred to a piece of medical equipment as a "thingie".
7.  When the blood results came back, they called my emergency contacts without telling me first.  As a result, I got a panicked call from my parents for pretty much no reason.
8.  I had gone in for a stomach issue with cramps.  The doctor's first diagnosis was appendicitis.  I think it was actually indigestion and stomachache and my time of the month.
9.  Who knows when the urine results will come back.

Would not recommend.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

In April 2014, I went to Beacon Urgent Care to check my health. The doctor, Monica Ball, checked my vision. She shouted out to me loudly several times in front of other employees and patients: “You are blind! Your vision is too bad!”
I said to her: “I am not blind. I can see the sign of Beacon Urgent Care without glasses.”
She shouted out anxiously to me again in front of all other people: “You ARE blind! The sign is so big! You ARE blind!”
She really embarrassed me. She is too rude and unprofessional, without courtesy.< /Text>< pics>

Horrible, horrible.  Will never go back.  We were the only patient there and yet still had to wait 30 min to see doctor.  Husband finally went out to act like he had to pee, they came in right away and the doctor had been out in the main area sitting and visiting with the staff.  Bed side service was awful.  Concerned my son had a broken arm and they just grab it and pulled, no sympathy from doctor or nurse.< /Text>

They don't  have urgent service. You have to wait at least 30min to see a doctor and their every care service are so so so slow. If you really urgent situation should go different  place.< /review>

I had visited for My son's leg injury. After X-Ray it has been told and report given to me that there is a fracture and I need to visit Ortho specialist. They will decide whether surgery is required or not. They put temporary plaster and said Ortho specialist will decide about surgery and if not required then they will put permanent cast. When I had visited Other hospital Ortho Specialist.  I have been told that there is no fracture and report given by Baecon is incorrect.

Saw your response. Very first I got incorrect treatment. And also surprised to get bill today where visiting charge is 279, where as it has been told that visiting charge is 140.< /Text>
