Be sure to check their store out, they have a lot of products on hand, clean minimalistic store which makes it easy to look/shop for items. Staff are very friendly and knowledgeable!

<Review>My car need a deep vacuuming after it was broken into. There was glass all over my sons's car seat base and I had brushed the car against a tire in the past, leaving a black mark on the car. I was considering getting it repainted but Paul did an amazing job. He took off all the black tire mark. He came the same day I called and was very nice and courteous. If you want someone to come to you I highly recommend Paul!</Review>< Date>

The store is clean and has a variety of products on the shelf. Very good service by their staff! I was there recently for the first time and was helped by Anthony. I purchased their new pressure washer and some other goodies. Was even given some stickers. Although I had an issue with the wand missing from the box they were quick to give me a replacement the next day. Will be returning again! Thanks.<//Review>

HORRIBLE COMPANY DO NOT BUY! I wish I was able to post pictures but my matte black rims are completely stained and ruined due to their product. I am a professional mobile detailed and have used many different similar products and wanted to try out this company. Complete waste of money and to top it al off when I call to tell them that my rims are now ruined, they tell me it’s my fault. No. I know what I’m doing and do it for a living. Horrible products and even worse customer service!</Text>

<name>Jesse Walters<//name><text>These guys are great! I placed my order and chose 2 day shipping. The next day I found out they're local! I drove in told them my dilemma, and they found it in the warehouse waiting to be picked up and gave it to me. So excited to use my new polisher and a day or two early! :)
Now I had started asking a few questions and learned some tips and tricks and bought more products. ;)
Thanks guys! Oh! Did I mention they refunded the shipping costs also?? Haha, I was happy to get it early and didn't even ask for it...You just earned a customer for life!</text><UserId.>107116785335698201731< /UserId.>< Date>

<Text>This review isn't on their store but is on their online website and service on making a purchase.  In addition, I'm also reviewing the products as well......

After purchasing a new truck, I was looking for a good sealant and polish to shine it up.  After doing a lot research, I chose Adam's products and very glad I did.  I purchased the Polish, Clay Bars, and Graphene Spray (Not the concentrate).  The truck has never looked better and it keeps a glare on it even after a solid rain.  The polish and clay bar are self explanatory but the Graphene spray was definitely the prize of the lot.

Application was easy (and I'm not a pro detailer) and I went with the spray in case I made mistakes.  I've even had neighbors stop by to ask what I used on the truck.  After a wash, I do coat it down with the "graphene" detail spray and the shine pops back just like it was freshly polished.  I couldn't be happier with the purchase.

Online purchase was easy and shipping was within 24 hours.  Because they have to use UPS for liquids, shipping time can be a few days but that's no fault of Adam's......

Keep it up and you have a new follower!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
Adams has really stepped it up with fast reformulations to already good products. I love the new VRT with SiO2 in it. The old one was great but washed off too easily. Now it really does cure to that nice satin shine for weeks. Anyway I'm glad they are back in SoCal case orders took way too long coming from colorado. Now when they ship from Anaheim I usually get them the next day. Cheers AP<//Review>

I am so very grateful for everything Dawna and her team do to make my Phoebe happy and comfortable during the day when I have to work. I have utilized both the daycare and training through their services. They go the extra mile to demonstrate how much they value my girl and the team shows me everyday how much they love her.<//text>

Dawna and all the staff  are amazing. We have been taking Teddy Blaze to daycare once a week for almost a year, and we have definitely seen a difference in our energetic Labrador retriever. With consistency at home and at daycare Teddy has been able to follow commands, and continues to be a fun loving canine to our family and friends. After daycare Teddy is exhausted, and we know he had a fun filled day with the staff.<//Review>

<Text>We have been using Canine Corral for several years for weekly day care and occasional overnight stays for our labrador retriever. She absolutely loves it there- in great part due to the incredible staff. In fact, she starts barking with excitements several blocks away and can't wait to get inside. Dawna and her team deeply care about all the dogs they work with, and you can see it in  the way that they run the business. Highly recommend them!< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I have been taking my dog Winston to Canine Corral for two years now. The staff here are amazing (especially Megan and the owner Dawna) and know how to deal with dogs  that can be a bit more challenging to handle than most. My dog has some fear based aggression with new people. Most other daycare/boarding facilities would automatically reject a dog like mine because of these issues. Canine Corral has a wonderful owner named Dawna, who happens to be an amazing dog trainer. She runs Happy Tails Dog Training that Winston and I completed together. She saw his problems and helped me be a better, more confident owner with him. That in turn makes him a better, more confident dog so he can be more secure and not so fearful of new people. The staff are amazing and I feel great knowing I can drop my dog off for daycare or boarding and that he is in the best place for him to be well taken care while I am gone!!</text>

<rate>5</rate><text>We love Dawna and her staff. Our pitbull, King, has been coming to Canine Corral for boarding since he was 14 weeks old. He is now 1 year old and 100 lbs. He's a rambunctious big boy, but the staff is great with him and give him breaks if he gets out of line. After coming for boarding, we finally decided to invest in training classes through Happy Tails. I'm so happy we did. I was really nervous to see how he'd do, but it was well worth the time and investment. I learned so much about my own temperament and behavior I was encouraging without realizing it. King was super anxious his first class (and so was I), but Dawna did a great job of making us feel comfortable. It only took 1 and a half classes to get us settled and comfortable with the other dogs. I highly recommend Canine Corral and Happy Tails!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>We have been satisfied clients of Dawna since before she opened Canine Corral - all of our dogs have taken her training classes and earned their Canine Good Citizen certificates.

Our dogs have boarded at Canine Corral several times, and always come home healthy & happy (One of our dogs used to come home hoarse from other boarding facilities, because she was barking all day due to stress and anxiety.  That's not a problem when she stays at Canine Corral, so I know that they are taking good care of her and that she feels safe and protected.)

It's really nice to be able to go on vacation and relax because you can 100% trust Dawna and the staff at Canine Corral to take care of your furry friends.<//text><user_name>Sandra Grabhorn< /user_name><GmapID>0x808e345b46bb02a3:0x2bb247ad427d62d2<//GmapID>< user>

<text>Canine Corral is fantastic.  We have taken our dogs there for both daycare and boarding for many years.    Our dogs are always excited when they realize they are going to Canine Corral.  When I drop them off they are happy and wiggly with all the staff members.  I never worry about our dogs when we go away.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Our 4 month old Aussie pup has loves going here. The staff were great with our first day jitters. Explaining everything and answering all our questions with patience. Fitch excitedly helps when we pull up and can't wait to go inside. We're so grateful for a safe, caring place to send our boy for a day of fun.<//Text>

<Review>Canine Corral is amazing. They are the obvious choice in the Bay Area for boarding. Their staff is extremely friendly, their prices are competitive, and the facility is great (they are also in the process of making it even better). I recommend this place to everyone I come in contact with that has to board their doggos.</Review>< Pics>

They have provided daycare (and boarding when needed) to help get our rescues more socialized with other dogs and people.
I, as a rescue representative, am confident in the care our dogs receive while at Canine Corral.
I am presently representing a dog that has some issues and Canine Corral has been working with him on a once/weekly basis until he is adopted. They are respectful and understanding of his quirks and are in no rush to end his daycare. This dog is exhausted when picked up from his day at Canine Corral, and we are relieved to know that he is receiving the extra care and expertise to help him gain some confidence along the way in finding a new home.</Review>< pics>

Canine Corral is my dog's second home and second family. The staff is amazing and truly love the dogs they care for. I have no reservations about leaving my dog for daycare or boarding services. We have also taken advantage of the training that is offered. This is the second dog I have taken to Canine Corral and I can think of no better place to take her.</Text>

Excellent care for my 4-legged baby. He loves his friends, both human and canine, and always looks happy to go (starts whining with excitement when we approach the last intersection before Woodard). When we first started coming here, he was leash aggressive and didn’t appreciate others of his kind but Dawna quickly ‘cured’ him of it and we really appreciated her not giving up on him. Other places we tried wouldn’t take him after 10 min intro. But Dawna saw that he was a great dog who just needed some help with his manners and took him on. Now they tell me he gets along with everybody and has no issues at all.
The humans also do a great job with his nails and with brushing his coat and he loves the extra cookies and peanut butter he gets in the process ;) Highly recommend this place.</Review>

Our little Ava was a shut-down, unsocialized foster fur baby when we first met her. After training with Dawna and lots of days in doggie daycare at Canine Corral, she is a different little lady. We love her to death and are so happy that we are foster failures! Thank you, Canine Corral!</Text>

My boyfriend and I have a one year old terrier/border collie mix that we adopted. Over the course of the last 6 months we noticed that Arya was very afraid of other people and was getting defensive with other dogs. So, we looked for support and canine corral has done wonders for Arya! Everyone there is so helpful and after just 4 days at daycare over 2 weeks we have seen such positive improvement in aryas body language toward other dogs but strangers as well. That is a testament to the workers at canine corral and their interaction with the dogs at their day camp I truly can’t thank them enough and would recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat. We are also doing dog training with them as well.</Text>

There isn't enough words to express how incredibly amazing this place is! The love, care, and most importantly attention they give to your dog's is above amazing. We left a horrible day care, feeling pretty worse for wear that there wasn't going to be anywhere safe for our dogs. Any doubts we had were IMMEDIATELY gone after we received a phone call a few hours into their first day that they were doing great! The Web cam shows how much the people interact with them. Finally, the best part came a week later after we got a personalizes movie starring our dogs first day. They're wonderful!

Best, Wilbur/Willow's parents!<//text>

I am absolutely devastated by the way my dog Percy was treated during his 6 night stay at Canine Corral.

I booked holiday travel late, and so our standard boarding facility was booked. Percy is a frequent boarder due to my work travel, and we're pretty low-maintenance when it comes to boarding standards. All I ask is that he's given his meds as appropriate, he gets a decent amount of exercise, and he stays in clean conditions. By all accounts - he was to be treated as such when I booked his stay at Canine Corral.

When I dropped him off (inside the tiny lobby that barely fit the staff member, me, and my dog), they effectively swapped a clipboard for his leash, without giving me an opportunity to say goodbye or to see the crate he'd be staying in.

They further refused to give him his blanket or toy in his crate, so he had nothing that smelled like home.

The webcam nearly never loaded when I attempted to check in on him. The few times I was able to get it to load, I didn't see him, and I rarely saw ANY dogs at play. More often than not, it was just a still image of the outdated, dirty facility.

When I called 4 days into his stay to see why I hadn't seen him at play and if there was an additional fee I could pay to get him more playtime (which I was more than willing to do), they listed out his 3 scheduled playtimes of the day so that I could check in on the webcam: 10:40-11am, 12:40-1pm (note: the camera isn't active during this time), and 2:40-3pm.

That adds ups to 60 total minutes of play, or one hour out of his crate for the entire day. This is beyond unacceptable.

When I picked Percy up this morning, not only was his nose bone-dry and his fur falling out in puffs (he's a mutt - his grooming is typically very low-maintenance), but big patches of fur on his rear were completely matted. In our years of boarding and daycare, this has never happened. This strongly supports my earlier position that he was just sitting in his crate 23 hours out of every day.

Further, their records didn't indicate that I'd prepaid, although I'd handed my credit card over the night I dropped him off. I'm not entirely sure what it was used for.

I now have to make an appointment at the vet to have his matted fur shaved off.

If you love your dog at all, you'll stay far, far away from this place, and you'll warn other dog-parents to do the same.

Canine Corral should be shut down.</text>

I have yet to receive a response other than Madalyn’s pictures of Percy, an invoice showing $40.50 of medical care expenses, and her statement that he has hot spots.\nI have a video link above of Percy during his stay.\nI will bullet point my response to her paragraphs so I may clarify any confusion of how we operate.\n(Paragraph 2) Per Percy’s application, he has “severe” allergies that make him susceptible to skin and ear infections. His medications were administered as directed.\n(Paragraph 3) Standard protocol is that any new dog is brought in for an evaluation day prior to boarding. The size of the lobby did not change from her evaluation day drop-off which was 11/16 to her boarding stay drop-off on 11/19. We are a boutique daycare. We also provide tours by appointment upon request. Madalyn did not request a tour.\n(Paragraph 4) We provide blankets and toys which are bleached daily. I do not want to be responsible for bleach damage to clients’ belongings.\n(Paragraph 5) The new webcams are not compatible with Chrome. The webcam is on weekdays 9am to 12pm, then again from 1pm to 4pm. Dogs are out playing all day long, even from 12pm to 1pm. Animal control officers during their yearly inspections state we are consistently one of the cleanest daycares they inspect. As many of our regular clients have seen, we are in the middle of updating our facility. The floors will be last.\n(Paragraph 6) The overnight dogs are let out starting at 4:00am, they are rotated out hourly for their playgroups, which last until 8:00pm. Dogs that have extended stays will either be rotated more often or less often, depending on their activity level and level of fatigue from playing.\n(Paragraph 7) Of course Percy was out more than 60 minutes. That would be unacceptable if it were as true statement.\n(Paragraph 8) I have included the video of Percy’s stay and see no evidence of big patches of matted fur. Had we noticed big patches of matted fur we would have contacted the owner immediately. Nor did we see any problems with his nose.\n(Paragraph 9) Payment of the daycare evaluation day and the holiday deposit was made on November 16th by credit card. The balance of Percy’s stay was to be paid on pick-up. We asked for payment on pick-up and Madalyn appeared to be unaware she had not paid. She walked out without paying the balance of her bill.\n(Paragraph 10) I offered to go to the vet with Percy as I wanted to see for myself the matted fur and what has prompted this damaging review. I am waiting to hear from her veterinarian the results of the vet visit and will update then."}< /Resp>

Very helpful community of Muslims. They work well with the community and the law enforcement. They even fed the homeless and explain about the religion of Islam to you if you want to learn about it. Great people.<//review>

We openly Invite every non Muslim to come in observe what the Muslim society here in Rancho Masjid is all about. We have or Friday sermon at about 12:30 p.m its in English. Everybody's invited to come and observe the American Muslim culture. We are not here to convert anybody and stuff our religion like other faits. We are an open society open to all walks of life all faiths so if you are interested please come and observe what we do here and how we contribute in community.
I am NOT a board member of this mosque I am just someone that goes there on regular basis to practice my religion.
With all the problems that America is facing right now as a society, and all the problems that an American family is faced with would that be alcoholism, drug addiction and homosexuality quite honestly you will find only Islam offering practical solutions to all these issues. Our religious director is a 20 year convert to Islam, and he can relate to all the questions and misconceptions that non Muslims have about Muslims. We believe in educating people from all walks of life.<//Review>

The place is amazing
I loved it.
We were passing by from nevada to los angeles.  And we googled we didn't expect it was open as the most of the islamic centre we stop as usually they just open for prayers . But this islamic centre was open
It was clean. Has a ladies prayer room  big one.
Clean toilets
Keep it up< /Text>

The food looked delicious but was a let down. The chimi was very bland, the margaritas tasted more like a virgin drink. I gave 3 stars for atmosphere, good service, and although the margaritas were light on liquor they were still tasty.<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>We had the breakfast buffet and it was excellent. They had a wide variety of dishes like menudo, eggs in red salsa, carne con chile, refried beans, red rice, chicharrones in salsa, chicken in red salsa, fresh fruit, and pan dulce. They also had handmade tortillas and quesadillas. For drinks, they had agua fresca, hot chocolate, and coffee. The bill was about $96 for 4 people but the food was all delicious so it's worth it.< /Review>< Pics>

Good food, but they lose a star for homophobic remarks about a customer overheard from a loud obnoxious waitress. Also they are no longer at the original address on Shaw/West. May have to try the new location and see what their Sunday brunch is like as it used to be very very good.< /Text>

The place was nice and clean and our server was on point with our drinks and food was hot and large portions.

The new Los Amigos is one of my favorite places to go! Fresh, new look and bright colors. There’s the buffet on the weekends, with the same selection of tasty food. Very friendly and helpful staff as well. The mariachi on Fridays is lively and fun, and we always have such a great time!</text>

We went on a Friday night and had a fantastic time listening to the Mariachi music and listening to the people that hopped on the mic to sing! A fun family atmosphere!

The food was awesome too! Highly recommend this spot!<//Review>

<text>I went to this place on a Saturday night. They had a mix of Latino music and the cover was 10 bucks. They had a place to order food next to the dance floor which was very appreciated. The ambiance was good but their drinks weren't too good. The price is good but the quality is not the best. Overall a good experience.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

The food is good quality and most of the drinks are good quality. There only drink I wasn't a huge fan of was their michelada,. Not enough flavor but on the other hand their margaritas were on point. The really redeeming gave here was the service, our server was amazing, Fernando I believe. Best server we've had in a long time!</Review>

This place is amazing. The food is delicious the drinks are so good with a wide variety. On the weekends it's such a great place to come with family and friends to have a relaxed fun time. The owner has a very sharp eye on service and making sure we are enjoying ourselves and have everything we need. New favorite spot.</Review>

Good food. A little pricey for the buffet because they do not give you the option to take out drinking fountain. Other than that, no complaints.<//review>

The food was delicious. As a first-time comer wasn't sure what to expect and wasn't disappointed with the food. Service was a different thing. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great, they did however have a big party of at least 20 to 30 people so I attributed not so great service to that. I will be returning for some of their delicious enchiladas. There Palomas where delicious, I haven't tasted any better ones elsewhere.< /review>

Not sure if it was too much frijoles (the salad had a lot).  Or if it was the sour cream, or guacamole, the guacamole was kinda brown.  But, I got sick the next morning after eating here.  Going to the bathroom 6 or 7 times in less than 5 hours is not any fun. Maybe a coincidence, but the place was also empty when I went there on a Thursday afternoon.  I'm not sure if I'll try this place again.  Or if I do, maybe I'll just stick to the  cocktails.< /text>

I think the food was lacking flavor, mostly. I had the Chile Verde with eggs with papas and beans. Generally speaking, the food was lacking in flavor
. The pork was not as tender as I think it should be and everything needed salt and a dash of pepper. I also don't know how they heat up their tortillas but the flavor was us on those also I did not even eat them.</review>

I am surprised that this restaurant is not packed with customers. I really enjoyed their brunch buffet! The food was good and they had a great variety of dishes. They also had yummy drinks that came with the buffet as well.<//Text>

Outstanding restaurant!  Our first visit and we plan to go again in the near future.  The food is terrific and the drinks were excellent.  The live Mariachi band was very very good, but a little too loud for dinner time.  They need to turn down the speakers a few clicks.  We dined with our two friends and the four of us really enjoyed our meals.  A nice treat is the salsa is custom mixed next to your table the the degree of spiciness you like.  Our salsa was excellent, not too hot.  The menu is wide ranging and the drinks were perfect.  Highly recommend this restaurant for Mexican food lovers.  Thank you Los Amigos for the great dining experience.<//text>

This was the most disgusting food I have ever had in my entire life. Ordered the camarones ala diablo they were super dry and tasted so bad! The tortillas were uneatable and the shrimp were even worst I could only eat one and now my stomach is hurting really bad. I paid $25 to eat some rice.< /text>

I visited Los Amigos restaurant to try them out for diner. Delicious Mexican food & also  they have a buffet during day hours. Alcoholic beverages had been made well.
I finished my third drink and noticed employees started to put away tables & chairs, to my surprise they had begun to prep the restaurant for a night club. So if your in the mood for dinning and dancing this is your one stop for it all.<//review>

This was maybe my 4th or 5th time to Los Amigos and let me say. Amazing authentic Mexican food. The service is always beyond amazing. The waiters/waitresses do not hover or ignore. I feel they come up at the right moments and right amount of times to see how your doing or how they can assist you. Always friendly and always welcoming. And their buffet is a big bonus.< /text>

I found a fingernail in my food, after I got disgusted by that and my stomach was feeling ill, this restaurant believed that they were being generous by giving me a 20% discount. It should have been free, I could not eat the rest of the day. Bad customer service.< /Text>

Menu so expensive  and very small portions.  Food was terriable the sauce and beans were from a can. thre taco was small, taco bell makes bigger tacos.
And if you wanted tortillas its extra $1.25.
I will definitely  not come back or recommend to anyone...😝< /Review>< pics>

2nd time comin here and my first impressions was dampered by a dramatic bartender. My husband and I were the only ones dining in the afternoon and this bartender came in wearing skimpy torn denim shorts showing her butt and a skimpy tank top, flip flops, messy hair and she was loud and cursin and talking about some drama with friends the night before to our waiter. The waiter was a super gentleman and I can tell he was concerned about waitin on us and tryin to listen to the bartender. We ended up cutting our meal short and asked for our tab :( we may not be back. Food was excellent but that was very unprofessional on her part.<//text>

Food is delicious and Miriachi on Friday night's is great entertainment!!  Adding new review for the new place on Blackstone and shaw.  Food is delicious and fresh enchiladas, menudo, pan dulce, eggs in salsa, carnitas, pan cakes, salad and etc etc.  Remodled with nice bright furniture and walls.👍👍👌😀</review>

The mole sauce is ok, except instead of chicken they pour it over some unchewable brick of leather that may or may not have technically been considered meat at one time.

Every failing restaurant suffers from this disease of buying cheaper product to cut costs, which ruins food quality, reduces revenue, and solidifies the need for buying ever cheaper and lower quality product.

Have some self respect and order edible chicken. Seriously.< /Review>

Excellent buffet choices on Sunday mornings. My absolute favorite place in Fresno for Mexican food. Try menudo, chicharrones in chile verde. A nice lady makes the handmade flour and corn tortillas at the buffet table.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) I ate there yesterday Saturday, and as a Mexican or Mexican American, I can tell you I loved the buffet variety: chicharrones en chile verde, chicken breast chunks in mole, pork meat in chile verde, menudo, chilaquiles, chicken salad , nopal salad that I liked a lot, carnitas, and desserts. And handmade corn tortillas. I was satisfied and I really liked it. I recommend it.

(Translated by Google) The good Jamaica water, the bad food, my husband ate it because he was very hungry, I ordered marinated meat and it turned out to be a Milanese type, as soon as I told the waitress that I had mistaken meat, it was the menu and very rudely He told me that was what you ordered and that's it, his behavior was as if he was doing us a favor in serving us and I still mentioned that I had not liked the meat and he totally ignored me, first time visiting the place and I think it will be the last

(Original)
El agua de Jamaica buena , la comida mala mi esposo se la comió porque traia mucha hambre, yo ordene carne adobada y me resulto un tipo milanesa , en cuanto le comenté a la mesera que me había confundido de carne fue x el menú y muy rudamente, me dijo eso fue lo que ordenarste y punto ,su comportamiento fue como si nos estuviera haciendo un fabor en atendernos y todavía le mencioné que no me había gustado la carne y me ignoro totalmente, primera vez visitando el lugar y creo será la ultima<//text>

<text>It's okay. The water is kinda muddy looking, but it's easy and shallow to swim in. There's also a $5 fee to park inside. It gets too crowded on the weekends, so it's better to go there during the week if you want a nice spot to yourself. People leave a lot of trash littered around. Overall, it's an okay spot to cool off.</text>< resp>

<name>Cristina Ayala< /name><userid>117153843698899739840</userid><Text>Nice park that has potential.  We enjoyed being in the water with the kids floating on these hot days.  Nice place to be in the water and have a tailgate get together.  Picnic tables are only walking distance as well as the restrooms. Their grass is pretty dry and I would recommend wearing shoes as theres alot of dried burr-clover(spiky round weed) that hurt when u step on them. Other than that its a good place to hang out with friends and loved ones.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

There was technically water you can swim in and barbecue grills but very poorly maintained and the grass was dead and yellow and mostly dirt, with people having no respect for the land. Trash every where. There were trash cans and restrooms but very filthy. 5$ was not worth the entry.<//review>

<Text>I love it...But this last time we went, the guy that collects the $5.00 gives you a little paper. And I put it in front of my windshield. And that's to show that I paid. Forever everyone one time or other goes out to the store or goes out of the park for something, including me. And we come back in. Well the week before that this girl went out several times. The guy at the window never said nothing. She also had her ticket or little paper on her windshield. I went out  a couple of times and came back. I mean that's why you carry that paper on your windshield because you paid. Well I went back to my house because I left the pot of beans on so I went back to turn them off. Came back the guy at the window stops me. So I  smiled and showed him my little paper on my windshield. He ask if he could see it and I said sure. He keeps it and says its $5,00 dallors again because you left. Never have I seen this happen before. Then I noticed he was doing it to everyone. And they only open the window on the weekends or holidays. This was on a Tuesday... And I ment to go to the store before I came back but I forgot.  So I needed to go to the store. But I was not going back and have to pay altogether $15.00 for that day. I feel I was RIP off< /Text>< pictures>

<userid>116563700943807146652<//userid><Text>Very good park for family and children. It gets crowded when the water levels are up. Children have a blast in the water and it is a dog friendly park. Many people let their dogs swim in the water. A huge problem is littering in the water. People are disrespectful they don't pick up their trash after their barbecuing it results in very dirty and murky water. The management should hire people to pick up trash they are understaffed when it is summer time with water levels high. Please do something about the trash. That's why some stars are taken from my review. Also there is a gated area for dogs but it is a shame it's very small. They should have built a larger fenced area. Mind you this park is not free; entrance with a car is 5 $ and free if walking in. But you can come in free if no one is by the window.</Text></record>

It is sooo peaceful here on the weekdays. My daughter loves catching tadpoles. I love floating down river. The water level is just perfect. Weekends do get crazy and there is 5 dollar parking ( cash only)< /review>

Hardly anyone picks up after themselves and restrooms are disgueting.

There are hardly any shade spots unless you get there early. Also bring canopy and chairs due to no seating or shade near water.

It's just an okay place to cool off for cheap.<//Text>

<Review>There isn't much to this park unless there is water in the river. Certainly not worth $5 if you're not going swimming. On the south side of the park across the river is the Kingston historical marker. This is only accessable if the river is dry or you’re willing to trespass the south entrance since it's gated up.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x8094e97bc9af2481:0x20ff7c7c07add7ea</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

As of 5/30/18 the water is flowing. Shallow (talking mainly waist to chest deep) but still flowing none the less. It is a dumpy looking park. Visitors left trash everywhere, which is a shame--we don't have a lot nature-water access close to Hanford. It is a great place to set up for large groups--bring covering because there is not a lot of shade options. Also, you will mostly likely have deal  with dudes, hanging out drinking, smoking  (pot) and blaring their loud music at their cars. So so much for enjoying quiet nature.  (this was a weekend crowd--not sure how it is during mid-week). Regardless of what they are doing, eveyone seems to be enjoying there time.<//Text>

<Rating>3</Rating><review>It's a nice river that is not deep at all! Perfect for little kids at deepest [going across] goes up to an average 10 year old to their chest, which is nice. Nice place to spend the day. But I gave it 3 stars bc 1) druggies go and do their stuff there which is annoying as heck because your having a nice time then they pull up right by all the families and that stuffs STRONG! So beware. Cops need to patrol the place and not allow that stuff around families (family areas). Go do that at a lonely place where there are NOT kids and others that don't take part in that! 2) the restrooms are not taken care of. They are dirty. Haven't been cleaned in who knows how long. No toilet paper or toilet seat covers. And a puddle of dirty water in the middle that stinks bad!
So it has its good and bad. Oh and water was freezing for a hot day.  Kids don't care though lol.<//review></record></dataset><record>

It's a pretty dirty park with trash laying about,  beer cans, and broken beer bottles in the river shallows, bathrooms for men and women are so filthy ! with toilets full of feces and in the men's urinals too! It's quite disgusting!  Never again will I visit this park. And to top it off, we had to pay $5 to get into the park. Like I said... never again will I visit this park.< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I roasted for 1 week and the truth was that it was very dirty with rubbish thrown away cartons of beer disposable plates it hurts that I did not take my broom ... and I was in poko ondo. Last year I loved it because the water was very clear and it was low. .

The guy working that day basically tried to tell me that I broke  basically saying in so many words that im a lier. Wouldn't give me a refund and said its nothing he can do I have to come back in 4 days when his manager is there. So unprofessional and rude , waste of my time and money. Will never spend a dollar with this place again ill stick with parts authority way better customer service. And no problems with returns.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Best place where you can get price for your European vehicle. Best pricing for OEM parts and friendly staff. They can ship and deliver parts to you as well which is very helpful. Special thanks to Rick for his service. Highly recommend this place to everyone!</Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>I came in and told the big counter guy that I need front and rear brake pads and oil and oil filer for my 2014 BMW 328i.  He asked me for the last 7-digit VIN (just to make sure I told him the right vehicle I guessed).  After 10 min of searching for parts on his computer, he verbally listed all the items and price for each.   I agreed.  He then told me to wait for a couple of minutes.   After 5 minutes, another guy in the warehouse came out with all the parts in the cart.  Paid with credit card and left.  Smooth transaction although none of them smiled nor made me feel welcome which I did not expect either.  There is only one guy working at the counter so plan to wait for a while if there is a long line.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dbffbd749cc319:0x73fe98cee1d87a6d</GmapID></record>

Listen closely to me.  When you engage someone on the phone, in any business, start with sirs or ma’am’s, and behave as if the person may buy $1,000,000 dollars in parts from you.  My brief, and last experience on the phone with this company was seriously just bad.  The “dude” that spoke to me was repeatedly just unprofessional in our conversation.  I’m not your peer, nor am I some “dude” high school student that you are speaking with.  Get your flipping act together over there.  I’m done with this company.</review>

<review>I needed to replace my coolant reservoir tank and coolant for our BMW and they helped me just fine. They saved me $$$'s. Yes they are a bit monotone and perhaps should hire younger blood that can smile and provide customer satisfaction. But if y'all want some kissing butt while you pay the bucks its real simple...shop at the dealer!!!
Thanks Northside, I'll see you guys soon.<//review>< pics>

Decent Prices, you need to have a resellers permit to buy though. On the other hand service is horrific, Rick the only counter guy it seems has developed attitude issues throughout the years. Wait times if you are a walk in could be in excess of an hour. Also these 5 star reviews are fishy as heckk here.<//review>

It helps to bring the VIN number so you know you get the right part and aren't playing a guessing game with the parts people, wasting their and your time.

Sure, their phone system isn't great, but if you leave a brief message with the necessary info you'll get a call back with a price.

Have been getting parts here for years and will continue to for life.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dbffbd749cc319:0x73fe98cee1d87a6d<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Arrogant, they answer the phone whenever they want,
some of them try to mimic a New York accent and they don't even know where's the Hudson river nor if it has water on it.< /text>

Parts are at decent cost. I've been going here for OEM BMW parts for the last 3 years, I have no complaints. Staff is pretty dry and can come off as rude sometimes but I don't care, as long as I get good parts at a decent price.</review>< pictures>

Juan and the front bald guy provide the worst service possible. They gave me the wrong price, and refused to redo the ticket. They have the worst attitude, and are incredibly rude. I don’t know how they haven’t gotten fired.<//Review>

<Review>This place has horrible phone skills. I have been purchasing parts from this place for a very long time. And it is always the same when you call. You get put on hold for 5 or 10 minutes just to be sent to a voicemail.</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
If it were not for their pretty good prices and OEM part availability for my BMW I would not give them ANY stars. Their customer service is HORRIBLE. There is a short stocky guy who speaks Spanish who has a serious attitude problem. Also you can NEVER get someone on the phone and they say to leave a message but NO ONE returns a phone call. Also when you try to call their sales department, you have to go through this ridiculous menu only to finally get to the sales line and listen to an extension list of 10 people whom of which will never answer their phone and or call you back if you leave a message. Also haven't they heard of a modern phone system that rings all phones and he first person available can answer it?< /Review>

Excellent source for imported automotive OEM and/or after-market parts. In most cases, pricing always lower than dealership.< /Text>

<text>Good parts, but service is hit and miss. A few of the guys really know their stuff and some of them fumble around looking for simple things. I've tried calling for parts four or five times. Never actually managed to get someone on the phone that could answer my questions. You guys are THE PLACE, please get your act together.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Bad customer service. Unfortunately no other parts store around to compete with them. If you have a repair shop, this service will slow you down and you will lose money. I certainly do not appreciate their attitude.< /review>

<text>What a mess! Order online. This place is absolutely horrific!

Via phone: Only hold for a total of 22 min. He picks up the phone "HOLD PLEASE" very quickly and puts the phone down. Transfered 3 times because of a useless automated phone system.  TERRIBLE

On my way!: "you have the part there? its in stock? its actually in your store? YES he says, ill put it aside for you. IS IT REALLY THERE? Nope. They have it on back order and wont be in for two weeks.

Honestly they from time to time have the rare part that no one else has. but the effort to get it, i would just rather order it off the internet.  These people need to get their stuff strait because of a terrible phone system, no one ever answers, and they cant track inventory worth a damn.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><GmapID>0x80dbffbd749cc319:0x73fe98cee1d87a6d< /GmapID><Name>JL<//Name></record></dataset><record>

<review>horrible service. they gave me the wrong part claiming their book said its the right part when its not . It is very obvious that it is not the correct part. then claimed that the part was rusted and scratch when its still in the manufactured packaging and in the condition they sold to me as and refused to take it back. DO NOT SHOP HERE. They are over priced and horrible customer service skills</review>< pics>

If they had negative numbers, I would grade them in the red (-4).  HORRIBLE customer service.  Not to get too dramatic; however, when I see a business operated in the fashion, I wonder where our country is headed.< /review>

<review>Another Ramen restaurant to go to. This was yet another random find for a bowl of delicious Japanese noodles in robust broth of your choice. Rather you enjoy miso, tonkatsu, shoyu, etc., based broth you will like their selections of flavors. So check out their menu, they offer many other Japanese dishes. Service is good and we got our meal expediently.<//review>< Gmap_id>

I WOULD GIVE THIS ZERO OR NEGATIVE NUMBERS IF I COULD!!!
I honestly don't know how people eat here and/or still go here! I got the Shoyu Basic Ramen  for my mom and I, it was so disgusting. The noodles were basically undercooked/raw. It looked and tasted like if they just mixed grease with water. I also got the calpico drink, but then decided to exchange it for a Sprite, and the person who came up to me who I  assumed was the cook, gave out a very nauseating sweaty smell. I also ordered the fried chicken and when it came out, it looked like pork rinds instead of chicken, and when I decided to rip it apart, the skin came off very easily and very very greasy and inside there was black spots in the chicken as if it was rotten!!! When I decided to just pay and get out of there with my family, the waitress was nice and all but that doesn't really count when the food was repulsive. The waitress also told, who I assume is the manager that I disliked the soup a lot and it seemed that he didn't care at all, he just shrugged his shoulders. WILL NEVER COME TO THIS SPOT AND AGAIN AND YOU SHOULDN'T EITHER! If you really want to eat Japanese Ramen go to Shin Sen Gumi!< /review>

Second time coming here. Got the lunch special comes with the ramen they had 6 different ramen to choose from. It comes with a salad and rice. I ordered the shrimp tempura which was delicious.  As this was my second time I ordered the same because the tonkotsu ramen is my favorite. Give them a try. It's a small ramen spott but worth the try.</Review>

When this place first opened it was spectacular. Amazing ramen, and the best chahan in the South Bay.

I don't know if the chef changed, or what, because now it's just o.k. We've gone a couple times since the quality changed in the hopes that it was a fluke, but it's not pretty consistently "just o.k."<//Text>

They were closed before Thanksgiving. There was a note on the door stating they are closed “On Thanksgiving Day” with the date of 11/23. Did they get their dates wrong?  I’m confused.< /Text>

< review>
I didn't know about this place until I was walking by and saw pictures of ramen on the window. Finally had a chance to check this place out on Thanksgiving Eve. My dinner companion and I were quickly seated around 7:30pm. Menu isn't overwhelming, options of sushi and various ramen broth with light appetizers.

I opted for the tonkotsu miso while my dinner companion went with the black garlic tonkotsu. My tonkotsu miso was pretty standard to most other places. There were definitely lots of flavor, not overly salty with tender pork. The ramen noodles itself were extra fine in texture, yet not soggy. Nothing too out of the ordinary.

I had few bites of the black garlic tonkotsu and in the future, I'd get this instead. The flavor was stronger, in a nice mix sort of way of light garlic, soysauce(?), with a hint of sweet?. It's unique and I haven't tasted anything like this elsewhere. Ingredients inside was standard to everything else in terms of quality and quantity.

2 eggs per bowl and they're brought on the side, you peel them and add to your ramen. My only dislike would be the "extras" you can include for additional charge. My dinner companion added corn (extra $1) that came on the side as well. There were maybe 20 kernels of corn total. After we both put 1/2 in each, we had to go digging for the corn. Not worth the extra $.

Service was good, atmosphere was nice, restroom was clean, I'll probably be back.</review>

Ordered the combo Ramen + 2 had rolls. They charged me for the combo + a Ramen bowl. Very deceiving menu. Not going back...</review>

(Translated by Google) Gyoza is Ok, fried chicken is good. Ramen is also yuzu salt and pork bone Ok, and katayaki soba is rich in seafood.

(Original)
餃子はOk、唐揚げはまぁまぁ。ラーメンも柚子塩と豚骨Ok、かたやきそばは魚介味が濃厚。</text>

<Review>Their cashier system doesn't play nice with seasonal offers, so there's always some confusion with the pricings. Items are also mislabelled and/or in the wrong sections, giving the wrong impressions of clearance offers. Good clothes for kids though.< /Review><date>1577569807162< /date>< pics>

< Review>
I stopped in for the first time today and was so happy I did.   I only had 15min before they closed so I needed to get what I came for first.  Thankful that they have everything organized and easy to find/identify.   I found way more than I expected to in the few moments I was there.  Prices are fair.    I’ll definitely be back.< /Review>

Not ADA compliant! I cant get through in my wheelchair . And they blame it on Christmas stuff, but in a full year since I first had trouble in their store, they haven't fixed it. And yesterday when I tried going back, I was told "good luck getting through." She was so rude and my feelings were hurt.<//text>

The manager / owner was so rude and bullying to me and my child. She has to be a very unhappy person, and I pray she finds peace. Some of the other customers saw what she said/did and came over and told me they were sorry, and it was wrong what she did. Will never shop here again, although I like the store.</Text>

<review>Chiquita's had an amazing selection of traditional Mexican dishes as well as some delicious reimagined vegan options. The mango margarita with a spicy rim was delicious and I absolutely recommend it. The highlights of our meal were the carnitas topped on my bowl and the vegan enchilada. They have a beautiful back patio, bar, and outdoor live music when circumstances permit. The owner, Gabriel, came straight to the table to make sure everything was good and tell us a little about the history of the restaurant as well as our opinion on the new vegan enchilada. 10/10 would recommend.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUyRlUJsIvjpG7m8Y3L1AIgp5BI61s5BrObgRB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYaZgcdvn8xIaVRBAARL7L3q5V5HhX6ulD1hMG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3GmV8WnSPkEylW8Aysri03fGrOxycksqs2b3q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
You can bet your asada that Chiquita’s is one of my new favorite restaurants!

Chiquita’s has been run by Gabriel’s family for nearly 55 years which shines through in their delicious menu.

We tried the Chiquita's Bowl, Vegan Bowl, Chips and Guac, and we got to try the Vegan Enchilada. To drink we had a mango margarita and a Mexican lager.

Everything was extremely well done but the enchilada and margarita really stood out! We got to try the vegan enchilada and really hope it will get added to the menu! The sauce was on point and overall so flavorful! The mango Margarita was so refreshing and came in a fun glass too. We loved the bowls! Both used pinto beans which was a fun switch up. The chips and guac were great too! Normally the guac comes with cotija cheese but they kept it out so I could try.

We were lucky enough to eat on the patio, which is a total vibe. I can’t wait until after COVID to be on the patio again with live music! I highly recommend checking them out!< /Review>

It was the first time we'd attempted on this restaurant. This appeared to be a spot that was always happening. It was highly crowded. It took 50 minutes to get a table on Sunday night......well worth it.</Review>

I have been to Chiquitas a dozen times.  It has been a few years since I was there last.  They get five stars because of their tacos.  I used to order two tacos but one is enough now.   Everything else is good or very good but not extraordinary.  It is better than the Mex restaurants in old town.  Staff has always been friendly and quick.  The food is old school Mex comfort food.  For what it is they do a great job.  I will be back again someday.<//text>

<text>Call to place pick up order. Put on hold for 33 minutes. By the time we left Sycuan casino to Chiquitas I'm on hold on the phone. Finally got there. Showed the host my phone that I'm still on hold. He laughed. The wasn't that good.  Next time I'll go to the taco shop. It's cheaper and better quality and service.</text>< Pics>

I love Bavarian food and I have had my fair share in the motherland. I ate my way through Germany from top to bottom, and it was a spectacular experience. I was so excited to find Suppenküche by chance and the food was no disappointment! Loved the: beer selections, the lamb was off the hook, the chicken was super delicate and moist, and the pretzel/cheese was super authentic. It is kinda loud, but what do you expect in a  beer hall!!! I can't wait to go back!!! Danke!</Review>

I'm sure this place has been serving the same dishes the same way since the 50's. And why not? It's always packed and always delicious. If you didn't like the mole, it's because you ordered something else.< /Text>

One of my top spots for delicious Mexican food. Very appetizing. I had a cousin come into town and asked me to take him back here. It has a cool feel to it. Menu is like a cafe in Indianapolis I loved.< /review>

Been coming here for years with my family. I firmly believe they've got you've best chips in the country. They cook them fresh for each order. You've also gotta try their margaritas. First timers should get at least one slurpy.  Their guacamole is on point too. The place isn't cheap but it's good. Try it...</text>

I have been going to Chiquitas for over 50 years.
I have to admit I drove by several times during this Covid pandemic and they were closed
A couple of weeks drove by and I couldn't believe they were open, they were actually putting up the now open sign. This has to be one of the most consistent restaurants you can visit. I always order the cubed beef and beans wet. And the food was excellent and the amazing thing is the food taste exactly the way it has always. They have kept their prices consistent. Bottom line is the family has built and maintained a excellent consistent dining experience.
Congrats on getting back open and I will see you soon!

<Text>Oh boy, where do I start with this one, a true five star. Great location and plenty of parking. The hostess greets you with a friendly smile and seats you promplty. It’s very festive with a big bar and lots of Separate dining areas. We decided to sit in the back/outside patio while the waterfall was going and it was so peaceful and pleasant. We met the owner and he told us the history of how it’s been in his family for many years. We ordered chips and salsa and the chips came out freshly made, warm and the salsa was delicious and just perfect. My daughter and I were both starving and when the food came out we are so content, it was delicious and fabulous. Everything had such a wonderful flavor to it. The owner informed us that there is live music on the weekends. We will for sure be coming back for that. Excited to learn more about this little place.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>One of the best. I have been going to Chiquita's since I was 5. Back then it was located on Federal & 47th Street next to the Rainbow Market. Delicious authentic Mexican food, generous portions, reasonably priced. Enjoy an evening with your Mexican family today.<//text>< username>

Fantastic Mexican food on Home Ave. The family has run this place since the 60's and they've recently re-vitalized their menu and now they're open on Sundays for brunch. Follow them on social media, they are doing some fun new things. The staff is happy and the drinks are strong.</review>

Service was good, but if your looking for authentic mexican food this is not the spot for you. Carne asada tacos were super salty . Strawberry margaritas was basic.<//text>

Good service and decent food. Was expecting to be wowed more given the time it has been around...close to 50 years or so?? But was just ok. Likely to try it again though to get another opinion on it :)<//Text>

<Text>The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because the waitress takes a long time to come back. It was my birthday and I had to wait like 20 minutes for my drink, and we were right in front of the bar. I even had to get up and get my own glass of water because no one was coming to our table. Food is good, though.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rating>

<Review>Drunk bust boy/manager, one server and poor customer service
Upon arrival we were told to sit wherever we like, as we were walking past a man and woman who waited until we were about to sit (whom I assume work their) told us we could not sit in that area because it was too noisy due to construction (although two other people were sitting in the same area)
This is not the issue, the issue is we had to ask for our water, ask for napkins, ask for specials, ask for our check and ask if someone could take our payment. The man and woman who told us to sit in another area sat at the bar and dranked the entire time we were their.
While at the counter the same man mentioned earlier said what's the problem after my daughter asked if we could have someone take our payment. I asked was the man was he the manager and he said he was just a bust boy. This is the same man who we encountered upon arrival who had been drinking at the bar with the woman who appeared to work their. Instead of apologizing after we explained we were just trying to pay and leave he continued to say "What's the problem, what did she do" (referring to the waitress who did nothing wrong). In fact she was the only one on the floor working.
I told the man their was no need to talk to him if he was just the bust boy and asked for the manager.  He then told me he is the manager. This makes the situation even worse as it was clear he had several drinks continued to laugh while I explained that she wasn't the problem and that the problem was the service. It was clear to me he had too many drinks. I told him I just want to pay and leave while the woman at the bar whomever she was continued to saying they only waited for 5 minutes. I like to know how would she know if she had her back to us drinking and talking the entire time. Bottom line no need to go back and forth with a drunk bust boy/manager.

This place always had awesome food, unfortunately the service and professionalism needs attention.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Server was horrible at taking our order and checking up on us. She was VERY helpful with the party of 6 guys two tables over who had ordered alcoholic drinks. but because we only ordered sodas with our meals she did not check on us periodically. I won’t be returning but the waiters definitely need an etiquette training for waiting on customers. The food was ok flavored and overpriced. I won’t be returning for another horrible experience.< /review>

<text>I ordered take out from this restaurant while on vacation in San Diego. I ordered enchiladas, quesadillas and guacamole with chips which were all amazing. They gave and my kids a drink while we waited for our food. Great family vibe to the place. Would definitely go back!< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Text>As the saying goes there's no school like old.
This place been here forever, very traditional good size plates and they stick to the theme. Waitresses in field skirts with flowers in their hair. Big margaritas with a heavy hand.
Many may drive by looking to find something better down the road well they just do not know what they're missing.</Text>< Pictures>

The street tacos and margaritas are to die for (personal opinion). Although we've changed our favorite entrees over the years, we have never been disappointed.  The place is jammed with families, young and old, and it  has a wonderfully diverse clientele. No noisy TVs or any of that, just people enjoying food and company! On hot days or evenings, the patio with fountain is open.  The same family has operated the restaurant since it's founding, generation to generation.  The prices are reasonable.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

We've had a much better service at Roberto's AND better food!
We came in and were ignored until I asked if we could sit anywhere. A woman behind the bar told me "yes, but not the patio. It's reserved". We waited about 5 min. Then she came to our table and moved us to the patio and took our drink order. It never arrived from her.
My mom overheard this lady was sending a new waitress to our table. She came, took our orders and left. Came back with my soda and told us the coffee was heating up!
The first waitress came to our table with a very weak coffee.
More than half hour into our arrival tacos the size of a small donut came with barely anything in them. And only one order!
It's not as if the place was full! Not peak hour!
Mom was so upset, we paid for the coffee and soda and left.
We went to Roberto's, better food for very reasonable prices and the attention is excellent.<//Text>

<Text>One of the best burritos I had anywhere, it had an amazing sauce on the top and the meat inside was full of flavor and super tender. It is obvious that this place uses good quality products. I found out that has being around for about 30+ years..cold beer and my meal has me definitely coming back!!!<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Passed this place a hundred times and never knew the food was soooo good.  We stopped in with the kiddos for brunch. I tried the New Mexico plate enchiladas with shredded beef with a Don Julio margarita.  The main dish, chips, guacamole and salsa were excellent.

Unsatisfied.
Prices were too high for the quality of food.
Only thing we were content with was the over priced $9 Guacamole.
Other than that food was salty and servers were rude.<//Text>

Chiquita is the cheapest business in San Diego. Every item is price separately! Chips extra. Sauce extra. Sm. Beans $3.49. sm. rice $3.29. One waitress Doubles as Bartender. Food ok.  Old decor.</review>

I do believe after two evenings of eating at the Chiquita's Mexican Restaurant speaks for itself. Wonderful selection of Mexican styles that will soothe not just anyone's taste buds, but everyone's taste buds with satisfaction representing a qualification of authentic Mexican Cuisines . "No need to run South of the Border". No need I say, "adios".</text>

This place is great in every way but I can only speak for the last 30 years.
Just understand there are always large numbers of police and US Marshals eating there so don't even think of giving employees a hard time or shorting their tips.</review>

Went here for the lunch in June and was pleasantly surprised. Good prices, great food (try the guac), and friendly quick service. The outside might not look like much, but the inside is well decorated and well maintained.< /Text>

I've been dining at Chiquita's since 1982
When they were at 43rd & Federal
I love the ranchera sauce, the Chile Rellenos and have tried everything they serve
The full bar is well stocked, outside dining quiet, cozy & romantic and the staff the best
This is a 2nd generation local owned venue
Well worth a trip from anywhere in the county to try authentic family Mexican food</Text>

So I was visiting friends and they asked if I was in the mood for Mexican food...😐😒 duh! Service was great and the place was very clean! We sat at the bar where the very friendly bartender gave us drink options and promptly provided said drinks-excllently crafted- and took our orders. The food came pretty quickly, which was cool because they were starving. And here is my problem with this place:did you REALLY just charge me $7.05 per taco for "crispy" gr beef tacos so saturated with oil that they were not only completely soft but gave my other food an oil bath containing meat so salty it burned my friggin tongue? Also, why do you think salt, garlic powder and chili powder makes gr beef taco meat??  Plus, if yo are an actual sit-down restaurant too busy to handcraft your re-fried beans, fine but do SOMETHING to make it yours/flavorful- aside from dumping copious amounts of salt into them and topping it with the most generic-non melting cheddar cheese you can find then coupling it with your bland over-cooked rice and charging for the privilege! Also maybe google how to cook Mahi Mahi before you torture this beautiful delicate fish with your heavy-handed cooking methods and serving up a fillet the consistency of Mahi Mahi jerky! Seriously Chiquita's you aught be ashamed of yourself for abusing your loyal local clientele and newcomers with the bait and switch of great service and disgusting food! Hone your craft...google is your friend!</text>
