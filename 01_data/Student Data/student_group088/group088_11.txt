If I could give this place less than one star, I would. If Google reviews had black holes for bad reviews, I would push this place past the event horizon.

Do not shop at this rip-off establishment.

A few days ago my girlfriend and I bought two iPhones there at an OK price. The salesperson sold us cases and screen protectors for the phones. We did not ask the prices for those, but I am willing to pay more than the Amazon price to support a local business. They also sold us one pair of earbuds. We did not know that the regular iPhone earbuds were in the boxes with the phones. The salesperson said the earbuds were regularly $120, but we would get them for $70.

When we got home we found out that we had been charged $119.96 for the cases and covers, that we did not need extra earbuds, that the earbuds we had bought should retail for about $30, and that the most expensive iPhone 11 screen protectors on Amazon are $20 for a two-pack. The packaging for the screen protectors was not in the bag with the iPhone boxes, earbuds and receipts.

When we returned to the store today, the salesperson told us he had done everything correctly, that $29.99 each was the correct price for the screen protectors and cases, and that the earbuds were not returnable, even though the package had not been opened. When I asked to speak to the manager, the salesperson claimed to be the manager and owner of the store. Another Cricket store told us later that they sell an iPhone 11 screen protector for $14.99. I am going to guess that price is for a two-pack.

I got no help from Cricket phone and chat support. They told me to return to the store and ask for the manager. They could not give me the name of the store owner, nor could they verify that the salesperson's name on the purchase receipt matched the name of the owner.

One can accept the $30 price for each case and add another $30 for screen protectors (rather high prices, but legitimate). That comes to $90 that we should have been charged. The total charge for the earbuds we don't want, the cases, and the protectors was $190. This store ripped us off for $100.

Let me repeat. This store overcharged us by $100 and refused to make it right.

Rip-off establishment. Do not shop there!</text>

Worst Donut Shop Ever ! The amount of chocolate placed on a donut is miserable !!! Almost no chocolate! This is a donut shop yet it has so many snacks that they don’t focus on the donuts. If you are looking for good donuts go to Mr. and Mrs. Goods Donuts locates in Glendale and Windsor. This is by far the worst donut shop ever< /Text>

I had a bit of an urgent situation with my long hair cat (big hair knots on his backside) and Lauren was so kind as to fit him in the very next day. And, the cost was quite reasonable. I just got home and am so happy with the experience that I’m scheduling regular grooming for him so his coat will be in better shape and he will be one very happy cat (& I’ll be very happy, as well). Thank you, Lauren for being such a sweetheart and helping us out so promptly. You rock!!!</review>

I started taking my pups, Oliver and Lucy, to VIP a few years ago after their other groomer retired. Prior to the switch, they had always been a bit hesitant to go (probably because their other groomer was at the vet’s office). It took only ONE visit with Lauren and Derrick for all of their hesitation to disappear. VIP took the time to calm them, cuddle them, and make them comfortable on that first visit and it made all the difference. Now Oliver and Lucy absolutely LOVE going for their baths and haircuts! They get so excited! VIP has always done a great job with my pups, with the grooming, and with the customer service. I know that Oliver and Lucy are well-taken care of and they are happy. I will never go anywhere else!</Text>

<Text>VIP Grooming is amazing! Lauren, Derek and the groomers take great care of our senior golden retriever. She has arthritis in her spine and give her breaks when needed and lots of love. She always looks so beautiful after her bath and grooming and smells so good! They also have great products to purchase from their shop. Lauren was great in helping find the right CBD and dosage for our dog as well and it's been very beneficial. I highly recommend them and wouldn't take my fur baby anywhere else!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I can’t say enough good things about VIP, Derrick and Lauren, and all the staff.

My chihuahua had previously gone to another local grooming facility but shook horribly and hid under the car seat when we pulled up. And as a pet owner , that scares you.

We’ve been going to VIP a few years now and we love it , and does our sparky boy ! They do such a great job, are priced appropriately , have so many great goodies for sale , and are super responsive to scheduling and concerns.

I’ll never quit recommending them! Hope to see their business continue to grow.< /Text>< pics>

We love everything about VIP. We have a 115lbs Mastiff/Boxer mix who naturally is a little hyper. They have a special way with him, and always make him comfortable, which makes us super comfortable. The price is an indication of the quality you receive, and the love and care they give your pet. I couldn't ask for a better shop to take care of our big boy. They have become more than a groomer. They have become his friend and he as well as them look forward to seeing each other. Thank you for always taking great care of Jaxon< /text>

VIP Grooming is an excellent place to have your pets groomed . I have an Old English Sheepdog he’s 120 lbs.  He’s a real workout lots of time spent on grooming him. They do a fantastic job .
Always getting compliments on him. They are very cautious with our pets. Love love love them 💙👏🏻< /Review>

VIP is wonderful.  I had several groomers unwilling to take care of my anxious baby, but VIP took her & has groomed her ever since.  She is not afraid to go there like she was at the petshop groomers.  She always comes home perfectly beautiful & sweet smelling.  Their prices are also reasonable.< /Text>

I have been bringing my dog (Ziggy) here for 2+ years and they have exceeded my expectations each and every time!  Great friendly staff, and always loving and caring to my pups.
I recently brought in my German shepherd, which after they tried to work their magic on her.. she still was a little too skittish (I knew this going in, as she has water anxiety).. but they referred me to a place that could help!!!
Will never go anywhere else.. and I always recommend them to everyone I know!
Keep up the amazing work, VIP 🐾</Text>

<rate>5</rate><Text>We absolutely LOVE Lauren and VIP Grooming!  We have been coming here now for 4 years and all 3 of my furry kids have been with Lauren since pups.  I always know they are being treated with love and care, and my dogs clearly love going there by the squeals of excitement they let out when we drive up to drop them off.  I don't just trust my dogs with anyone either.  Lauren always takes the time to let me know too if she notices anything out of the ordinary which I really appreciate.  For example she helped me catch early, conditions on 2 separate occasions which ended up being a UTI and ear infection when diagnosed at my vet.  Thank you so much to Lauren for making my girls so healthy and shiny, and for loving them like she does!  She truly loves them. My crazy lil trio.< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPw_VSEyOErlwF187kfXFWhgKDsUI51uvRCM4Hs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

I specifically chose this grooming salon because of all of the good reviews but I am actually very disappointed in this groom. It was sloppy, uneven and I asked them to do a breed cut and they chopped off my schnauzer’s beautiful beard!! There were still pieces of dirt left in his beard and it didn’t even look like they cut his back nails.. on closer inspection I noticed that they left a bald spot around his eye and what looked like dried blood on his back leg 😭😭 Due to my previous experience of grooming they could have done a lot better and I will not be bringing him back. Everyone seemed very nice but it was not the quality I expected! I posted what he looked like before and after.  This is my own perspective from my own experience working with dogs and while I respect all groomers I also value honesty.< /Review><time>1598214966159< /time>< UserId.>

We have loved having our 2 poodle mixes groomed at VIP. The groom is thorough, communication is clear and our dogs smell clean and not overly perfumed. Our dogs seem happier when they look beautiful after their groom.< /review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I’ve been taking my pups to VIP for years! When I got my newest baby, Molly- the crazy, hyper, loud, mouthy yellow lab, I was hesitant to take her in. I knew she wasn’t aggressive, but boy was she full of spunk! They let me know that she was a challenge and I suggested that maybe I shouldn’t bring her. They countered with the thought that I just needed to keep working with her at home and they would keep working with her at the salon. I was stunned that they didn’t say “take a hike!” VIP has continued to groom Molly once a month and she has made HUGE progress! She’s far from perfect, but these folks put their heart and soul into these pups and it shows!! Again, Molly is anything but aggressive, just a handful of goofiness, that is slowly being trained to be a good girl at the groomer, which in turn helps her be a good girl in other outings as well! Thank you to VIP for helping Molly with manners!!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I’ve been bringing my 2 dogs here since they opened. My female dog Molly is very anxious and cannot go to the vet without being drugged. She goes to VIP ok and always gets her grooming done. Lauren, Derek and the rest of their staff always put your pets first. They foster a relaxing environment and caring environment  for your pets. I have multiple neighbors that bring their pets to VIP and have similar things to say.</Review>

My dog has high anxiety so I gave him CBD calming treats hoping he could get a full service grooming. It didn't work they were only able to bathe him. They didn't do his nails, brush him, or dry him. He just got a bath and it still cost me $60. That is a rip off. I get it isn't their fault that they can't do more but the service should've been highly discounted at that point.< /Text>

When I called them to schedule an appointment I asked for pricing for my 10 pound pup. The lady that answered said grooming price depended on a trim ($45) vs a full hair cut ($65). Upon arriving I asked for a light trim clean up and emphasized not a full cut. When I went to pick up my pup they gave him a full cut and left him practically bald. Even the employee working the counter laughed and said "wow he's like a rat" as he handed me my pup... so rude. I wonder how he would feel if I told his children looked like rats. On top of that, I was charged the $65 dollars! They over charged me for something I didn't ask for in the first place. Never coming here again. One star for lying about their pricing, cutting ALL of my dogs hair when told not to, and rude service. Rated two stars, only for their dog treat selections.<//text>

A trim would have been face and feet only no length off the body at all. Also chewy wasnt called a little rat. We said he was like a little mouse since he was nuzzling in your shirt as a cute joke. Sorry you misunderstood. Chewy was a pleasure to have and we would love to work with you again! Please contact us if you have any questions. Thank you! 😊'}< /Resp>< userid>

<Review>Fantastic staff! They LOVE animals! Their prices are fantastic for the love and care provided. I love that they did not add a floral scent to the dogs. They smelled fresh and clean!

They offer a small selection of products for pets that also seemed reasonably priced.

We will use them again and highly recommend them.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<Review>The staff was awesome, very nice and reassuring. My puppy is very rambunctious and would get very defensive if we tried to cut her hair at home and brittany reassured us that she would be able to do it and would give her breaks if need be. When I came to pick up my puppy I was blown away with the quality of the cut and would have never believed she could look like that. 10/10 job would definently reccomend.< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
AMAZING! the staff here are the best! They love all over my big boy when I bring him in. He is a cane-corso so he is much bigger than most. They knew exactly how to handle him and gave him back so handsome. I am so happy to have found them. Great service every time. Never left without being satisfied. The staff also gave me a tip on how to control his shedding and also some fun things to try out to help with his teeth. He once had a sore paw, they took extra time to gently clean it out. place some pad cream on the is anti microbial and fungal. It was so nice.</Review>

They played with her & got her to relax as I was leaving. She was ready earlier than expected and looked incredible. They saved her beard and did everything I expected plus even more. Annie had a mole between her eyes & the last couple of groomers I had taken her to had nicked it & caused it to bleed. VIP left it intact with no damage.  She looks beautiful, smells great and is happy! That was so important to me.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Love, love, LOVE going here! My dogs have gone here for years and have a blast! We took our dogs to several groomers before and they didn't want to give my babies the TLC they need. This place is worth every penny! My dogs go there for a spa day every other months or so which includes a mani-petti, facial, paw soak, and more! We even get their nails painted. If you want your pet to get the VIP experience, go here! ❤️❤️❤️</Text>< Pictures>

I am so happy that we found VIP. My dogs are very picky about who they will trust and they are always so happy when we take them in for their grooming. They give a little card that tells what they did and what they found and what we may need to bring to a vets attention. I highly recommend them.</Review>

I was given a repair time quote of 2-4 hours. I called just before store closing, about 5 &1/2 hours later, and was told that work had not started on the repair.
I called the next day and was told that the repair was completed. I did not receive any text updates other that that I had left the phone for repair.
The two people who helped me acted liked they were not very happy to be at work, both were quiet, very soft spoken (granted they were standing behind a plexiglass barrier) and withdrawn.
So far the repair is working, however it's only been 24 hours since I picked up the phone.< /text>

The staff here lack customer service.  I went in there on a Sunday.  They was only one customer waiting. They were no one at the front desk. All i could hear were people just casually conversing at the back. One girl peeped and went back even after msking eye contact with me without even acknowledging my presence. I sat there for about 20 minutes without anyone even checking on me and what service i needed..POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. The manager needs to retrain the Staff. Very disappointed.

It's been 3 weeks, yes, 3 weeks, and I still have no idea when I will get it back or what they have or haven't done to it. The intake seems nice and professional. You will get a text message promising regular updates, but nothing. Texts back to that # will be completely ignored. I've called periodically and been told different stories - it's taking longer because it's a large screen, we're waiting for a part - but the details seem to reside with a tech who is always at lunch. I've been promised multiple callbacks, but haven't received a one. Maybe if they make this right, I will update and amend this, but at this point I recommend to stay away!</review>< pictures>

<review>They're good at fixing things but the communication is poor, requiring significant follow up, and they usually over promise and under deliver when it comes to their timeline. It is a Google warranty repair place, which is the only reason we use it.< /review><rate>3<//rate>< Name>

Superb service. Jorge was just great. He initially told me to come back in around 3 to 4 hours. I did drive a long way to the store so he told me since I came in early in the day he would expedite my case and just repaired my cracked screen in an 1 hour. Highly recommended.</review>

All original parts, quick fix, high quality repair, professional consultation. Not only the crews is very knowledgeable they know exactly what to do and offer multiple options for the repair. Much better experience than dealing with Appl* store.</review>

<review>I had to drive a distance to get to the store, and told them I would appreciate it if they could try to expedite the repair so I could just wait rather than drive home and return later. Although it still took a couple of hours to replace my cracked screen, I feel like they made the effort to complete the work quickly for me.
Very professional all the way around.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Our ATT phone plan uses uBreakiFix for our insurance coverage on our phones. I was a bit skeptical, but was super pleased by their work! Took in a Samsung Note 9 with cracked screen. They fixed it in about 4 hours (diagnostic alone takes 1.5 hrs after all put back together). Much better than waiting a week or more through other resources! They were very professional and showed new phone skin prior to installation and clearly explained the entire process. It was very easy process, and the desk person was super! I highly recommend, and I am confident in my coverage by ATT and Asurion!<//Review>

On everything,
I was skeptical at first seeing my shattered screen, but now it looks like I bought a new galaxy s20.  They quoted me a good priced, called me to coordinate and never charged me anything extra other than taxes. This place is honest and will always have my business.< /Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Finally, a cell / tablet repair shop that listens, cares and is knowledgeable with 'spot on' recommendations. No muss, no fuss,  just actual facts, repairs that resulted in return of Pixel 4XL to service, performing like new, no loss of data and under Google warranty, no cost to me. Akash, the manager, even took the time to help me with some app problems I was having and an iPad problem. I am beyond pleased with this experience in Union City, CA and with my initial contact in Portland, OR. I will not hesitate to return to uBreakiFix in the future and / or recommend highly.< /Text>< pics>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I dropped my phone off before 1:00 p.m. and I specifically asked AGAIN if my phone would be ready the same day because I had to drive from across the bridge since this is the only store on my phone insurance and they told me yes it would for sure be done today. Then I get here at 5:00pm, 4 hours later super excited to have a fixed front screen this is also right before they're going to close and they tell me that not only is my phone not ready also that they haven't even started on it and that I could come back tomorrow morning for it. I explained to the associate that I specifically asked when I came in and when I had called BEFORE even leaving my house if it would be done because if not I would just go another day as I'm not from the area at all and I would have to be driven 45 minutes to get there. I was just told that it was very busy today and they're very sorry about essentially lying to me. It upsets me more of the fact that I was in an accident cannot drive anymore and have to have someone drive me everywhere now and I not only wasted their gas and toll which I can pay for but I felt very bad that I can't do anything about basically wasting their entire day and them waiting those 4 and something hours with me for the phone to not be fixed.< /Review>< pictures>

Dropped off a Pixel 3XL yesterday that wouldn't turn on.  They were quick and understanding. They answered questions that weren't really their specialty and I am very grateful. Especially to Norma, who called with bad news but kept me in great spirits. After dealing with customer services over this phone issue it was Norma who broke the mold and comforted me over my loss of life (phone). Plus a free diagnostic doesn't hurt. Will definitely recommend.< /Review>

I KNOW THIS REVIEW IS LONG, BUT HE EARNED IT.  5 stars just isn't enough stars for this place.
I give them 12. I knew I came to the right place the day I called 2 days ago. I felt comfortable with the gentleman in the first 3 minutes of our call.  I live 4 hours round trip from this place. I have two businesses and can't be without my phone for too long. I broke one of the camera lenses on my new Samsung galaxy 21. I called Samsung and they told me I would need to send them my phone to replace one of the glass lenses. That was not an option. I'm a photographer and use my new phone in places I don't want to bring my gear. I asked them if there were any other options to get my phone fixed. They spent a little time trying to find a authorized repair center.  The lady finally said there is a place in Union City that has a great reputation.  When I called the gentleman, I wish I knew how to spell his name, spoke with me, he knew how important my camera was he also knew how important it was for me to not be without my phone.  I don't trust any place to have my phone but I could tell I could trust him. I made an appointment to drive up and drop it off for what I thought might be 3 hours. When I finally met him I told him I really needed my phone back as soon as possible.  So I left and stop back by a hour later to check in incase there was any issues, not only were there no issues, he said it would be done in a couple minutes.  I was ecstatic and wanted to reward him for taking such good care of me. I tried to tip him 50 dollars cash, he refused to take it so I tried to tip him 20 actually force it on him, he refused.  His comment to me was ( I'm so glad you are happy with our service) I cannot say enough good things about my experience.  I know how hard it is to own a business in California, and I also know how easy it is to get a bad review and not a good one. I personally think anyone needing any services this establishment has to offer is selling themselves short if they don't at least give them a call.
Best wishes to you sir you earned my utmost respects-

< Review>
I needed a repair on my Pixel 2 screen and found this place on Google's list of repair shops. I went to their website and scheduled a curbside drop-off of my cell phone for repair. After driving 45 mins to get there, I found there was no curbside drop off. I then went inside the store and talked to the guy behind the counter while he asked me for a bunch of information that I had already submitted online, and that he should have had in front of him. This went on for a very long time with lots of long awkward pauses as he typed on the computer. It took 45 mins for the guy behind the counter to tell me that they had no pixel 2 screens in stock and it would take at least 5-6 days for them to get there. I asked him why he didn't tell me that when I scheduled the appointment, to save me from wasting my time in driving out, and he just kind of shrugged. Another 45 mins drive home to spend the rest of my Saturday looking up another cell phone repair store that could actually help me. I don't know if all the "Ubreakifix" stores are this bad but I would avoid this one.<//Review>

Loved how quick they are with their phone support.  Anika on the front desk was awesome. She quickly identified the problem with my iPad on the phone, set up an appointment, and had the fixed iPad ready as promised

<text>It was Sunday night and they were about to close. With a great attitude and happy to receive a new client Vilma herself cut my hair and she was just perfect. I describe the stile I wanted and snip- snip she did it the way I like it. For now one will be my salon to go to. They speak Spanish and English. I even have my eyebrows done by by Rose

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>I found out about this hair salon through a recommendation from someone in a Facebook group. Because of that, I wanted to try it out. Also because it was very closeby, and the prices were really good. Now, a week after I got my haircut, I am still bothered by the experience I had here.

First, it was very hard to communicate with the lady who was cutting my hair because she didn't speak English very well.

Second, while she was combing through my hair, she caught and pulled my earring which was just a small flat stud earring. And it wasn't until after I came home that I noticed that it was bleeding and it got irritated.

Now the third and the deal breaker. Upon paying, the lady charged me $25. So I asked her how it got to that amount. The reason why I got surprised by this and asked her is because on their Facebook page (under the tab "services"), it clearly says "specialty women's haircuts - $15". And the picture shown in that category is even the same length/style as the cut I got! So, why am I being charged $10 more? So here's what really got me and really turned me off. As I was showing her what it says on their Facebook page, her demeanor changed and she just suddenly rushed and told me "ok, just give me $20". I kept going back and forth with her showing her what's on this page and asking her why she was charging me more. The way she was acting about it just did NOT feel right. She could barely get out of her words and just tried to utter that whatever was on the page was wrong and she kept repeating to just give her $20. Because of the language barrier, I felt it was just a hopeless case. I wasn't feeling well and I saw the discussion wasn't going anywhere. So, I ended up giving her $20, but I was definitely not happy about how all of that went down. I was very happy with my haircut despite all. But the way "business" was done there just made me feel like she was ripping me off. Is this how it really works at your salon?

I really, really wanted this to be a good experience because of the reasons I mentioned first in this review. But unfortunately, with this experience, I am saddened to say that this was my first and last visit to this salon. That way of doing business just doesn't go with me.

Oh, and another thing...there was hair all over the floor that wasn't sweeped up before they had me sit down...and it was still there after i was done. And some were not helping anyone while my hair was being cut.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I was not expecting a exceptional haircut in $10 anyways but my experience was very BAD, UNPROFESSIONAL AND RUDE. The staff (especially the lady I dealt with) was not at all professional and welcoming.
I went there for my kids haircut. When it was my kid's turn i went with him to explain what kind of haircut i expect for him. I just started explaining her and she said you go and sit i will do it (and it was RUDE). That was just the beginning.
After she was done, I paid and left (I didn't wanted to mention the $1 tip here but I did). Before entering the car (as the parking was in open space and was well lit) i observed that she left off a lot of hairs behind both the ears. I went back and showed her. She didn't even offered a seat to my son and started to fix it and then.......while fixing she over did at one place and messed it again. Then it was enough for me and i asked her to let my son sit and do it properly. After that she started murmuring and started saying very strange and irrelevant things(like, what do you want in $10.....you guys are like this only...people give me $20 tip....etc.) I asked her name but she refused to tell. I asked for the owner and some other lady told me that she was sitting in the next room, from where she can see and hear everything. She was not at all concerned about whats happening in her shop. When i approached her she listened to me and just said sorry. Then the lady who did the hair cut said why are saying sorry for me. And immediately the owner got on another call on her cell.....I just left, as I understood its waste of time talking to her too.......

<Review>I tried a hair cut for the first time here. Very disappointed. Rude service and not to mention the place is very dirty. I was also told one price for a hair cut an towards the end of the service she charged double. Try else where because this place sucks.< /Review>< Pictures>

Been cutting my hair with Vilma close 20 years now way back to when she was in Glendale at Mariella. She does great hair cuts at a very fair price. She's very nice and there's no need for appointment. Hair cuts are worth the wait you won't regret it.<//Text>

This place is very cheap and really reliable if you have to get a quick haircut. I've been with vilma since 2008!! She is a wonderful women and always gets the hairstyle you want. I strongly recommend people to try this place out, I would give it 10 stars but, the maximum is only 5.< /Text>< Pics>

Nice upgrade from their previous "hole in the wall". You get a simple hair experience. They have an established clientele. Walkings are the norm.<//text>

(Translated by Google) The woman who cut my hair did it bad, in addition that several times she hurt me and she like nothing. I just wanted to finish. Cheap but very bad treatment to the client. With 5 more dlls you get a better place. Nothing recommendable.

(Translated by Google) I went to cut myself with Luna. I showed a picture of me how I had it a year ago. I do not even look at the picture, it silenced us. He did not do me the
Cut as I asked and then blame me. I leave it shorter than I asked, all uneven, areas shorter than others. I asked for a Bob cut and he made me a mane and on top of blaming me. When I had shown him a FOto. A total disaster! Do not go there. If I could put 0 star I would put it.

(Original)
Fui a cortarme con Luna . Mostré una foto mía de cómo lo tenía hace un año . Ni miro la foto , nos hizo callar. No me hizo el
Corte como le pedí y luego me culpo a mi . Me lo dejo más corto de lo que le pedí , todo desparejo , zonas más cortas que otras . Le pedí un corte Bob y me hizo una melena y encima culpándome a mi . Cuando yo le había mostrado una FOto. Un desastre total ! No vayan allí. Si pudiera ponerle 0 estrella le pondría .< /text>

She told me everything I needed to know. I came in again today to see what I could give my cat for nausea and a young lady named Rebeca helped me out. She was very nice !!! And the best part was that she didn’t even charge me!! :)< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

I think pet feed stores just tend to be full of lovely people and pet food express as a company shines especially bright. I interacted with three customer service people and each were a delight. My favorite moment was staring at the ball selection wishing I could find a particular ball that magically appeared in my dog's life 2 years ago. When asked if I needed help I described the situation. The person I was speaking with knew exactly what I was talking about and showed me the closest thing. Above and beyond.</Text>

<text>My go- to place for everything dog. Super nice staff, above and beyond helpful. Great self- service baths. My Bee, a thick- haired Aussie Rottie goes once a month for a nice warm bathing session. For $15  shampoo, conditioner, towels all included. And treats on the way out. A little pricey but what dog place isn't. They take advantage of our weakness: our dogs, and cats and birds, lizards, fish, whatever.< /text>< Pics>

Prices are a little on the high side, but service and quality make up for that. Great store, they've been by my side from kitten to a grown cat supplying food, medicine, toys and treats. These often come with a buy 3 get 1 free deal or similar.
It's worth a visit for sure.</Text>

I will only buy my pet food here. It's an Oakland company. They have great selection, the staff is always amazing and helpful and happy to talk about my pet or theirs. I love that you can bring back anything and they'll donate it to the SPCA, even opened food. It makes me feel better about my picky cat. They have reasonable prices. Parking is super easy and they're also on Prime Now.< /text>

This was a wonderful Pet Food Express! The staff is knowledge and kind. We stopped by to pick up supplies for rescue kittens we are getting. They helped pick out what we'll need to help the kitties develop happy and healthy. Offered suggestions, we did get some wet food, a water fountain, a bed, toys, treats and litter supplies. We also got some raw goats milk, excited to be able to give the kitties milk and see how they like it.< /Review>

The store was great. The bath was great.... unfortunately the staff made me feel extremely uncomfortable when I was trying to get treats for my dog after his bath... they just followed me around and ask me over and over if I needed help... they really don't need to treat everyone like they're going to steal something I was a loyal repeat paying customer as always and they treated me like a low-level Criminal... I'm almost going to chalk it up to the fact that they were all new people that I hadn't seen there before<//text>

Staff is very helpful---they are available for giving advice and will offer to help you to your car. Store is clean and welcoming. They are very accommodating with returns--for example if your pet doesn't like the canned food you buy, you can return the remaining cans. Selection is pretty good, food and litter, etc are good quality, carefully considered. There is a nice dog washing station and occasionally they have animals for adoption. They also sometimes have fundraising efforts for animal non profits. Overall it is a really nice store and you can tell they care a lot about animals and making sure they get good products and care.<//review>

Sells only the best food for your furry friends.  Self wash bathing facilities and convenient locations.  Friendly and attentive staff.  Many stores offer training classes and a few have adoption centers.<//Review>

This location is really amazing. Super friendly staff, good selection of foods and toys, plus they have a dog washing station. I’d probably like it even more if I had a dog, but I find everything my sweet cat needs at this place. Definitely check it out if you have a pet and want to take care of your buddy!</text>

Staff are really nice and helpful.  Wish though they had more than one size for some items like kitty litter.  I'm a one-cat household and don't need a 20 lb. bag of it.< /Text>

<text>Amazing customer service, super helpful and very very sweet staff. They remember my pups the way every neighborhood staple knows its locals and I find it very endearing considering I tend to shop here somewhat irregularly (bc I'm lazy = delivery). Also, truly great selection of products in both quality and variety.< /text>< Pictures>

Wonderful staffs.  Very caring and friendly.  I used to go there a lot when my cat, Rex was around.  Unfortunately, he passed away few months ago.  Everyone was very caring towards Rex when he went shopping and getting a bath.  Thanks guys.< /text>

Good selection of quality foods and supplies, staff is always kind and helpful.

If you ask about their really cheap options for cat litter they have super cheap stuff out in the back.

They have a return policy which is awesome if your pets don't like the food you can take it back. That is unique huge bonus.

They also host pet adoptions and have a publicly available wash station for your dogs and the back. Great pet store.</text>

Staff greets you with a smile, immediately can point you to what you need, pet friendly (sounds like a no brainer, but I've been to pet foods that didn t allow pets)< /review>

I  always have the best time at the beach. The serenity in the surroundings is irreplaceable.  The smell of the water & sand  the gorgeous people, good food and the breathtaking sunrises & sunsets are priceless to me. One day I will own property near the beach and enjoy it's beauty daily. ...

This local park is very actively used.  There are some very nice play areas and large grassy spaces as well as basketball courts.  My grandchildren love to go there.  They also have a very serious Tennis area that is heavily used.< /review>

This little park with two basketball gyms, tennis, four baseball diamonds and a children's playground is always lively.   There are also picnic areas suitable for lunching or birthday parties (with a reservation.

I attended Movies in the Park last night for the kickoff of its 13th season of free family movies and free hotdogs.  It's held Every Saturday in August and is definitely a community favorite.

Some of the facilities are showing their age and the grass is a bit stressed with our drought conditions but the center still delivers plenty of outdoor fun.< /Text>

<text>I was in a bind to trying to find a few parts, oils, and accessories for a few of my motorcycles for an upcoming trip. I had tried calling around to multiple places and no one seemed to be able to help, until I called Advanced Motorsports! I called, and left a message within five minutes I got a voicemail back from the owners asking what parts and accessories I was looking for, I responded back with my list and and told me that they will call me back in 30 minutes. About 15 minutes later I was surprised and relieved that Juanita was able to order my parts overnight them and have them ready for me for pick up the very next day! The process is extremely easy and convenient using text messages, phone calls and voice recorded messages to communicate effectively and promptly (with a lot of detail might I add). Not only were they able to overnight the parts they were able to find and procure some parts that were really hard to find ; some places estimating close to 2 to 3 weeks!! not with Advanced Motorsports. This is a one stop shop, anything you need from Carb rebuild kits, desert flag whips, Whip mounts, light up whips, heck they even offered to try and find me some riding gear to get to me in time in order for me to save myself from running around the city trying to find helmets and boots. This is been my third experience working with advanced motorsports and I must say German and Juanita are amazing and true masters of their craft. They have been in the business for many  years and the expertise to get you what you need and when you need it! I hope they continue to thrive and serve all of us motorcycle riders in the Southbay. So if you're tired of dealing with snotty parts reps at other Motorcycle Shops, and want to actually talk to the guys working on your bikes come check them out, or give them a call they do their best to make sure you get the best experience not to mention get you the parts you need when you need it. Thanks a lot guys you made my last-minute camping trip one to remember!<//text>< pictures>

<Review>NOT HAPPY with their service I took my bike about 3 months ago to do a valve adjustment and carburetor repair, they gave me a list of things that needed service and I agreed to get them fixed for 1300 dlls, when i took my bike home i noticed it was having the same issue to get started like it had before getting it fixed. After speaking to a new mechanic it seems like they just took my money because my carb was not repaired and my compression is really low</Review>< Pics>

<response>{'time': 1601175294648, 'text': "I'm very sorry you are not happy, but you actually paid for a diagnostic! And we recommended a valve check first, due to the bikes LOW COMPRESSION! We saw valves were OK, so we advised that it might need a new TOP-END. ALSO the bike would not idle and only ranned with the choke-on! SO We recommended a carburetor cleaning. We took it step by step and nothing was ever done without your approval first. I have video before  and after. We returned it to you idling and we test drove the bike, but it went with no Guarantee due to low compression, it's all-over your work order. Also we did replace your sprockets and chain, Rebuild your Forks and serviced the bike with your consent, to total 1300 overall, not just on carburetor work. I HAVE VIDEO AND WORK ORDER INCASE YOU NEED A COPY. Thank you!😎👍🙏"}</response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Took my Harley front wheel in today to have a blown bearing replaced. They got it in and fixed it quick and easy. When it was time to come pick it up I was even sent pictures of the finished product. Great customer service and the best price I found for the job. Thanks again for the help.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I'm going to start of by saying that both Juanita & Herman were super helpful on so many levels & very affordable! I purchased a 04 R6 used and right off found out the seller lied ( should of known) anywho my experience getting back into riding started pretty lame, after getting my hands a little dirty I knew I was in over my head so I quickly searched for professionals and can I say I am very pleased with Advanced motorsports.  I highly recommend anyone who needs any service on basically any motorsport toys lol very reliable and assist you in any way they can. Thank you both again and take care, i look forward to future business with you.</text><response>None<//response>< Rate>

<review>Ordered some parts from this place and it was honestly the best deal! Juanita made sure I got the lowest price, they shipped fast, and were super helpful. They both had a lot of knowledge on motorcycles so I knew the bike was in good hands. They make a great team and you can tell that they love what they do. It’s nice going to a place that knows exactly what you’re talking about without having to search so much or call different places. Thanks for everything !< /review><name>Alexandria Lopez< /name>< userid>

This the mom and pop shop that you’re looking for.  The care and quality you expect with home charm you can’t find these days.  Great service and quality from their entire family.  I was also pleased with the turnaround time.  No need to shop around, high end service at reasonable prices.</text>

<text>I actually bought a used Honda 2005 Accord they were selling. They gave me a really fair, great deal (I brought my mechanic friend and he advised me to pay them what they asked in full). The process was very easy, and the owners very kind. Trustworthy, good people! Highly recommend :-)< /text>< user_name>

<review>I took my family's bike to get it repair, needed alot of stuff, this guys were great, they dont try to sell you stuff your bike wont need, they just go straight to the point and to the problem! If you have any concern about driveability this is a great place to get it fix! I wish they would've send me pictures of the work they did so I can share it with you guys! But I'll tell you what, the bike felt way better than what it used to be. The bike is a 2003 yamaha raptor 660 really heavy but all the work they did to it, made it feel like if its not heavy anymore!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I took my motorcycle in for carbuerator work he told me of some necessary work which I agreed to do. He kept my motorcycle for about two months and said he had fixed my carbuerators, and was completing the other work. He didn't have the experience to fix my carbuerators took my money and didn't warranty his work. Total cost $1800 I sincerely would not recommend this place. January 20th 2019 after taking my motorcycle to Ivan's fast bikes in Clairemont Mesa he took apart my carburetors and found that there was missing o rings and someone tried to patch my carburetors with silicone glue. I had to pay more money to get it fixed when Advance Motorsports had purchased 2 rebuild kits and installed them. Charging me lots of money to rebuild my carburetors. And we're unable to accomplish the task. Ivan's fast bikes they also gave me a two-year warranty on the rebuild and the labor of the carburetors. Something that Advance Motorsports will not do and did not do for me. I received a text message from Juanita after I put this post claiming that the Personnel at Advance Motorsports are competent and honest. If that's the case then I believe Advance Motorsports should refund the money I paid for the rebuild of my carburetors which Advance Motorsports was unable to accomplish. We'll see the integrity of Advance Motorsports I will keep you posted I seriously seriously doubt they will refund money! Why? Because look at the situation I find myself in by doing business with them. March 5th 2019 up to this point I have not received any refunds or phone calls from Advance Motorsports as you can see by now they are very unprofessional dishonest an incompetent watch out for this guy and he's planning to sell real estate I wouldn't buy a Tic Tac from this guy anymore this guy couldn't fix his socks drawer</Text>

HONEST MECHANICS
Not a common phrase for me!
But Herman is one if this rare breed.
Two times they saved my butt with a used bike from Craigslist: a xr230 with a broken transmission and now a xr400 with a stuck carburetor.
Both fixed to perfection, 1/3 of the price from everywhere else (believe me I drove the whole city).
I trust them, another very uncommon phrase from me!

He is creative and always willing to work with your vision.  All tattoo artist in the shop are very knowledgeable and work with each others to help further their knowledge. Bryan Ramire, the owner of the shop, who is a powerhouse and vet in the tattoo game, is always their for advice and suggestions if needed. Would always recommend for first timers and people continuing their tattoo journey.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Best tattoo experience ever! The shop was clean, business was well-lit, and the artists we're super cool. Eric Martinez is one hell of an artist!

They took time to answer all my questions and really made me feel at ease.

I'll be coming here for all of my tattoos.<//Text>

<review>So thankful, RANDY is my GO TO artist, from script to portraits. His line work is AMAZING, he is very experienced and professional, he is a fantastic artist and I have recommended his expertise to countless friends who are flaunting their tattoos with massive compliments. Very grateful! He can make any idea come to life, THANK YOU RANDY and the Reservoir Tattoo Studio.

UPDATE, 11/16/20
Since gladly leaving this review over a year ago, I have gotten a couple more tattoos here. Brought a paying friend for one as well, on the most recent one. I have spent several hours near and around this shop, respectfully. I absolutely adored this shop more than any tattoo shop I've been in whether in Cali, Moscow, Hawaii, Florida, etc THIS was my favorite shop, possible. Somewhere inside me, it still is. However I recently had an extremely poor experience with a Completely different shop affiliated with one of the ex-workers of reservoir. It's called "Lacy St Art Lounge". My experience with the "workers" of that shop was upsetting enough, that I left REVIEW on their ONLY business page, which is on Instagram, made sure the "manager" was tagged IN that comment (again on their ig "business" page, blocked every one BUT the manager, moved on. I am transparent.  When I am wrong, I have no problem admitting to it and making reparations! In this case, they proved I was not. After blocking and moving on, I begin to receive numerous blocked calls on my cell. Which is a private number I do Not give out. Ever. The next day Still receiving these calls, still receiving threatening messages on IG from people I have never met or seen before who instigated messaged me 1st, still attacking about this business review. A couple of days later, I am at my place of work (mind you, 40 miles away from where they're located) a group of this Lacy business bothers to show up pretending they're ordering food at my restaurant, when they are there to confront me? I had a Thorough conversation with them which I recorded from tip to tip. I explained myself and they didn't have much to explain, still I found more kind bones in my body and told them that I would drop the letter I was going to send to the Better Business Bureau about their MISconduct,  As long as I NEVER hear from them again. Explained over and over the fact that no matter what kind of business review I left, they are NOT in the OK to follow me, harass me, obtain my personal information etc. Later, I find out that they showed up at my HOME as well and spoke with my grandmother who does not know English, does not speak English. Asking about me! This is heinous to me! They also managed to show up at Reservoir tattoo studio right here, and say whatever it took, do whatever it took because now the owner of Reservoir shop has blocked me. I am more than likely banned from this shop due to the fact that I left a Review filled with Constructive Criticism to Lacy. All I did was instruct the female who was playing dirty games that she should make a separate personal page For that and keep her business on a separate page. Business ADVICE. It's been over a week I have been in police reports. Due to this harassment. It's unfortunate to me that Reservoir deems it fit to block me, when I never involved them in this situation nor did I say anything about them. It's malicious of these people from Lacy to show up there using my name, but they did, whatever is going on here, it is beyond me. I did my part, I left. I was further harassed, now am blocked from this shop. I'm sure I will not get a touch up on my mother's portrait from Brian, which is heartbreaking, but life goes on I suppose. I have been nothing but kind to Reservoir. I continue to doubt Lacy streets business practices. When anyone gets a chance, please explain to them that bad reviews HAPPEN, That absolutely never gives you the right to show up at somebody's house, work, and other places where there's person is not affiliated. Theyve proved my doubt of their practices was correct. Reservoir still gets 5 stars. Thankful for my tattoos! Much love Only.<//review><user>104796776534464543236</user><Rating>5<//Rating>< Name>

<Review>5 stars is not enough for this establishment or its crew. Some of the greatest guys I've ever had the pleasure to meet. Top notch through and through, great artists, great atmosphere, the client as an individual is always treated courteously and with respect. And the place is immaculate. If you've been thinking about getting body art or piercing(s) this is the place for you! You won't regret the service given nor the experience!! Keep up the great work guys.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I wrote a longer and more detailed review on Yelp since Google really limits you on the word count.
Environment: Clean, very very clean. The corners near where the couch is and the bathroom are basically spotless.
Artists: Very welcoming, felt like I was coming to a friends house and meeting the family, they are respectable and kind when greeting and talking to people, they make you feel at home. I loved hearing (eavesdropping) on the conversations and they are all pretty funny and they know how to make the atmosphere relaxing and gentle.
Tattoo: I wanted what is considered a complicated tattoo (a portrait) I was fortunate to have Bryan as my artist who did an amazing job and was able to capture exactly what I wanted.
Pricing: Honestly this should never be considered an issue or worry, if you are getting something permanent on your body, you better cough up some bucks. Research and ask around for pricing and what you want, it is not that hard. Yeah this might be my first tattoo I might not have the experiences other have but I did just that, I asked and researched to see and saw that some artist did charge a little higher even though their work was mediocre. But at Reservoir, they know their worth and they have the proof to show it.
Recommendations: Yes!!! I recommend this spot, it is crazy how good many of the artist are.
I uploaded a picture that was taken of my tattoo and I must say, it came out amazing. I want to say thank you to Bryan for being an awesome person/artist and the rest of the artist for being so kind to everyone and making my first experience an amazing experience.</review>

<Text>Just the sweetest n most professional dudes out there! Cruz was so accommodating and made sure everything was perfect and we were comfortable. As young women it was amazing to feel safe in a shop full of men with our pants down. The tattoos also look great and that’s all due to the guys making sure we were happy</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< UserId.>

<text>Charged my friend like $320 for seven letters on her fingers. These were not fancy letters. My best description would be stick letters. I think they just took advantage of her because they could. Was going to give them two stars but they really ripped her off.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Want something forever on your body Reservoir tattoo is the place. Great attitudes from the owner Bryan to the apprentice. Cleanness is held to the highest standard next to customer service. Don’t believe me just do your research, you won’t be disappointed.< /Text>

<Review>I don't know where to begin with this shop, this is by far the most professional, laid back, friendly shop I have ever had dealt with.
I usually get tattooed when I'm on vacation, visiting other cities so I'm always a "walk in". It's always very tricky since I am on a schedule and usually need to get tattooed the day of.
The dudes at reservoir were not only extremely polite but also very accommodating and welcoming.
Julio was able to fit me in last minute with  with the owner of the shop @Bryanramirezart.
Bryan made the process seamless. I showed him what I wanted and he went to work.
Seeing this dude work was incredible, nothing like I have ever seen before. I was amazed at the amount of detail and time he packed into every single part of the outrageous piece I was getting.
This might sound cheesy but I legit felt like I was watching Michaelangelo paint the Sistine chapel right in front of me! You can truly tell Bryan enjoys and absolutely loves his job and puts 100% of himself into all his tattoos.
You don't really have to believe anything I just wrote and just look at the images.
You know what they say... "A picture is worth a thousand words"
This experience was beyond my expectations, I wish all these guys and this shop nothing but the best.

CHEERS!<//Review>< response>

This place is great. I didn’t get the piercing artist’s name (sorry!) but he’s the best. Super professional, knowledgeable & kept everything extremely sterile. Fixed up a pretty bad keloid that developed on my conch from another piercing place and it’s so much better. 11/10<//Text>

<text>Randy is the MAN! He gave my two friends and I each our own individual tattoos as well as matching designs. The shop was closing before I had a chance to get my matching tattoo so he called me the following day and said he would finish the job free of charge. What. A. Homie. His perfect execution of thin lines and detailed work have all three of us beyond pleased!

Hands down the best tattoo parlor I’ve ever been to in America. The guys are awesome, so fun to kick it with - great environment. And the work they do is phenomenal! So much detail. It’s worth the price. My tattoo healed in a week. I’ll definitely be coming back for more</review>

<Text>So I met these guys wandering the NYC Empire Tattoo Expo, they were the nicest guys so chill. I got an instantaneous tattoo who helped me out by upgrading an old tattoo I had on my arm and added to it. Julio the apprentice was awesome! He really cares about his work and his art, he really took his time to make sure the tattoo was just right. If I lived in LA I would definitely hit up this shop! Phenomenal artists!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>I found this shop via Instagram. I really loved the art they posted and every tattoo artist in the shop had fantastic work. My daughter, nieces and myself were going to take the two youngest to get their first tattoos as they had just turned 18! Wow, we couldn't have picked a better place. All the artists in there were accommodating, Gee was super helpful, Julio the apprentice made us feel comfortable. We had three of the artist tattoo six of us. Once the owner finished his appointment of the day, he made it a point to talk to all of us and ask us how everything was going. Such a fantastic crew and wonderful experience. The two girls that got their first tattoos were pleased and comfortable with the experience. Very, I mean VERY sanitary! place/experience. We all plan on coming back and using this crew again. Highly recommended!!!</review></record>

<Text>The most beautiful tattoo i have ever gotten. Jerry’s portraite work is absolutely stunning. I didn’t know what to expect when i went in but it’s really everything i ever wanted. They were very hospitable and helpful throughout the entire process. 10/10 high recommendation.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Looking to get a tattoo?
I highly recommend this place.
After going to 3 other places and calling a few others to see if they were available for a walk in.....
Read the reviews, which were great and they welcomed us with open arms lol

-professional
-clean
-chill vibe
-ambiance is relaxed
-talented tattoo artist
-courteous and friendly guys
-prices are very reasonable for the quality of work these guys do
Base price: $100 and it increases of course
-serious with all the legal bells and whistles

Parking could be a problem if there is an event at the club near by.

I would defiantly come back and have all ready recommended this place to a couple people, they saw my snaps and loved it.

I would highly recommend. I wanted a quote on my arm at like 9:30 pm on a weekday and he stayed late just to do it. Aweome precision on the cursive letters.

Edit: The owner contacted me personally and was very professional. He wanted to know was up and offered a solution. Thank you. All the best.

Massive rip off. They way over charged me for 2 small simple tattoos. One I drew on myself with a pen and the other he transfered. Took him 10 minutes. Its my fault for allowing myself to be ripped off so hard. Dont be me and go down the street to someone other spot that doesnt run around their customers.<//text>

I just had a root canal done yesterday here. I just wanted to share that, contrary to popular media depicting root canals as this major painful procedure, it was a rather painless process and I am totally pleasantly surprised with how easy and painless it was!

The dentist was very comforting any time I looked hesitant or concerned them were quick to explain what they were doing and ask if I have any questions. No doubt it’s why I had such a pleasant experience, the worst part about seeing the dentist is the nervousness you feel when having drills in your mouth.

Considering the medical procedure and expertise of the dentists and the two assistants, the price seemed fair too. The office was clean and the staff was polite.<//Text>

Wonderful experience both visits! Beautiful office with very pleasant friendly and professional staff. Front desk staff Denisha assisted me with an appointment and she was very sweet.
My current dentist was off for the day and they were able to accommodate me same day for urgent visit. Yvonne assisted me with cementing my temp that came off.

Dr Shoreibah is so professional and thorough. I am very impressed with the outstanding service! Highly recommended.<//review>

Last minute, my dentist lets me know that I cannot finish a new crown because of a cavity that was hiding under the old partial crown (it was not visible in xrays).  She suggested Endo House, I got a consultation appointment that same day.  90 minutes after my apointement time, my root canal has been evaluated and completed.  I was elated.  The staff are all excellent, the doctor kept me advised me what he was doing and how much longer throughout the process.   The facility was excellent and the receptionist (Denicia) was a really sweet personality.  I highly recommend The Endo House!</Text>

<text>I came with Dr. Nour for a root canal and I was greeted by his lovely wife who was incredibly nice and attentive. Dr. Nour explained everything to me in detail and made sure I understood the service I was going to get which was very helpful. The assistants were friendly and helpful as well. Mariana who assisted the doctor took great care of me. My second visit was just as great. The office is very clean, sanitized and they are following the State guidelines. By far the best dentist office I’ve been to and definitely recommend it!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>Endo House is classy, clean, expedient, and extremely professional. Dr. Nour and his staff were very accommodating to my concerns and listened to my fears. I’m picky about providers and am fearful of getting any work done, but everything went smoothly, putting all my fears to rest.  It was quality first rate work and I felt no pain during the procedure. I would highly recommend. Denisha at the front desk is warm and was a great help overall as well. I honestly left wishing they could be my primary. If I have to get another procedure done, I’d only trust them. They set the bar very high.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Showed up dreading the root canal and left thinking “that was the easiest root canal I ever had”.  No pain or discomfort and the whole process seemed like it went by pretty quick. The Endo house is new, modern, clean and all the staff there are great.   Dr. Shoreibah is the best.  Definitely recommend for root canals, I had no idea it could go so smooth.

<review>Dr. Noureldin has topnotch bedside manner. I have never met a dentist/endodontist that is so kind as he was to me earlier. He put me at ease and took great care of me while he did my root canal. I didn't feel a thing! He is so pleasant to deal with and explained to me in detail the stuff I needed done with my teeth.  He's very professional, knowledgeable and most of all personable. Also hands down to his dental hygienists who were equally nice and knowledgeable in handling patients mouth/teeth. Thank you! Highly recommend this place :)<//review><Date>1621035039491< /Date>< gmap_id>

<review>I experienced my first (and hopefully last) root canal at Dr. Nour's office. I am glad it was with such an efficient and skilled endodontist. Dr. Nour and his team treated me with utmost care and ensured I was at ease during the entire process. I will continue to use Dr. Nour for any endodontic services, and I highly suggest you do the same.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Noureldin and his team for making my experience as comfortable as possible. When you visit the Endo House, you are greeted with a calming environment and caring staff. This means the world to me, as I can be quite the bottle of nerves. Most people associate pain and fear with visits to dental appointments, and I am so excited to finally have found a place where my comfortability is at the highest priority. You can tell that Dr. Noureldin really prides himself with making each experience as painless as possible, he truly is extremely gentle. I can not thank Endo House enough!</text>< Pictures>

<review>I never thought I would say this: my root canal recovery surgery was a very pleasant experience!  Just walking into the office brings a sense of peace and calmness to all of those “dentist jitters”. Dr. Noureldin Shoreibah DDS has a very kind and reassuring manner. He explains what he is doing and lets you know what he is going to be doing next. Maryanna and Yvonne were very helpful assistants. Maryanna (I hope I have your name right!) mostly helped me. She was so nice to me and made sure I was doing ok all through out the procedure.I highly recommend Dr.Shoreibah for any kind of root canal work you may need to have done. I honestly don’t know what else he may specialize in, but I know I would certainly trust him to work on anything else he may recommend for me.</review><gmap_id>0x80dd2799c4a096a1:0xa5887a212ab29b2<//gmap_id><date>1621661078413< /date><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>101350492721021838562< /UserId.>< username>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>100% recommend this place. I was recommended by my primary dentist since I needed 2 re-treatments of Root Canals. I can only say that myself as an experienced dental assistant I can truly say I am very glad I came here. Staff is very friendly, clean and professional. I can only say the same thing about Dr. Noureldin. He is amazing. I didn’t feel any pain at all while in the chair. He explained to me step by step the process and what to expect after treatment. He took his time and effort in making sure he did and amazing job. Least to say he has the best top of the line equipment to make sure his work is done properly. I have never been so satisfied and confident that my teeth were in good hands. I truly recommend this office for very professional Root Canal treatments. You will not regret it. Thank you Dr Noureldin for your hard work and thank you to your staff for making me feel comfortable and safe. I truly appreciate it. :)</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1613510643689, 'text': 'Thank you Isaura for your great review about our root canal treatment experience, we appreciate your feedback.'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

The Endo House is fantastic!! I had two infected teeth that needed root canals, one was an emergency that needed to be done the day I went in because the pain was so extreme. They took me in and fixed my tooth the same day. No more pain. They made the process so easy with my insurance too, I highly recommend them!< /Review>

<review>I went in for a tooth injury and the staff made me feel very welcome. The COVID protocols seemed very good and I was the only patient in the building at the time. They took great care with my traumatic tooth injury and seemed to really try for their motto of "saving the tooth" above all else.

Was referred to Dr. Noureldin for the possibility of needing a root canal.  From the moment that I walked into his office, the nervousness had eased and I began to feel a calmness.  His office was immaculate and staff was very welcoming and friendly.  Dr. Noureldin’s consultation was thorough as he sat down and explained to me my options. The fact that his motto is ‘all about saving your teeth’ helped in making my choice easier.  The decision to go for a retreat was indeed the right one, due to him finding a canal that another doctor had missed from a previous root canal procedure. I can’t thank Dr. Noureldin enough!  He is the absolute best!!< /text>

<text>My grandpa went to a general office to have a root canal procedure done, already having been in pain for the past month doctors were unable to continue with his procedure. He needed to be referred to a specialist, upon research I came across Dr.Nour. His reviews made him seem like a trustworthy choice. I’m glad to say that the experience with Dr. Nour and his office was AMAZING! They were very attentive to his needs and concerns at all times. They were able to go through with the procedure. A week later and my grandpa is no longer experiencing pain and is very thankful for Dr. Nour and his work. I will recommend him to anyone in need of an Endodontist.<//text>< name>

My upper back tooth was hurting me and I dreaded the root canal procedure that followed. I was lucky to have it done by Dr. Nour who was great at it. He was gentle and efficient, and listened to my concerns. He used advanced technological tools to make the procedure precise and seamless. Definitely was my best dental experience ever.< /Text>

<Text>Dr. Nour is a very competent and very honest root canal
specialist. Nobody touches my family or friends for any root canal needs but him.

He uses the latest techniques and he really loves what he does.

I highly recommend him for any root canal procedure. I trust him and believe in what he does.

The positive reviews you see here are for a reason! I had to have an emergency root canal and Dr. Nour and his staff couldn’t have been more accommodating. The office is first rate and clean; and the level of professionalism and talent is top notch. I’ve had one root canal when I was young and I remember it being quite painful, but my experience here at the Endo House was probably the best I’ve had with regard to oral surgery. Thank you to the entire team here and I highly recommend this office to anyone searching for an Endodontist!!<//Text>

Dr. Nour completed a root canal on my front tooth and the appointment could not have been easier! He explained everything in detail, made me feel comfortable with the procedure and most importantly I didn’t feel a thing! He and his staff create such a relaxed environment for patients, I can’t recommend The Endo House enough!</text>

I had such a great experience at The Endo House! The facilities are top notch and super clean. Dr. Noureldin was able to fit me in on a Saturday afternoon when I was experiencing a lot of discomfort. I had a lot of questions about the procedure and he was very patient in answering my questions. My appointment was completely painless because Dr. Noureldin is super gentle and he checked in a lot to make sure I was ok, which I really appreciated. He even gave me a call a couple days later to make sure I was recovering okay. I would definitely return to The Endo House and recommend it to anyone who needs to find a great endodontist. Thank you Dr. Noureldin and staff!<//Review>

<Text>Thank you Dr. NOUR and the team of "The Endo House" for an awesome and smooth service, from booking the appointment to the end of service, everything was perfect, the office was clean and professional, I never had a root canal done that smooth and painless before. Dr. OUR is very knowledgeable and used latest technology during operation, he is highly recommended.</Text>< pics>

<Text>I had an absolutely positive experience at Endo House, doctor Shoreibah and staff are very efficient and friendly. This clinic is following Covid safety measures. Use dental safety measures.
Doctor Shoreibah accommodated to my allergy problems and gave short breather breaks - much appreciated. Care instructions were clearly explained, follow up calls to check in on pain/ recovery and meds … courteous and professional.
I give solid 5. Would come back if needed in a heart beat. Definitely recommend it.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Dr.Nour is the best! He was able to save my poorly treated ,badly infected previous root canal tooth.
Root canal re-treatment is way harder with less success chances than the initial treatment but mine was a great success thanks to Dr.Nour’s high skills .
I wish I could give him more stars!
Thank you Dr.Nour.<//review>< Pics>

I never post reviews...but my experience with Dr Nour today exceeded my wildest expectations. We spent some time chatting before the procedure as he knew I was anxious.  My case was complicated and he expertly did the root canal. No pain!  Even the novacaine did not hurt.< /Review>

The procedure went very gentle and painless. Also, he educated me on the diagnosis and the treatment. He is so knowledgeable, skilled, and his work is impeccable!
The office has a wonderful and relaxing atmosphere which put any nerves I had at ease. I highly recommend The Endo House and Dr. Nour.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Dr. Nour is one of the most professional, caring, and competent clinicians I have ever encountered! He performed a root canal on one of my molar teeth and it was honestly a pleasant experience from start to finish. He has very gentle hands and I hardly felt a thing while I was in his chair. What sets Dr. Nour apart from most other endodontists is he is thorough, meticulous, patient, and comforting. He explains everything in detail, he never rushes through the procedure, and he makes sure all of your questions are answered before you leave his office. Speaking of the office, it is literally a brand new, state-of-the-art facility with the most advanced dental equipment. It is beautiful, clean, and I felt very safe there. His assistants were also super friendly and kind. They went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable. Overall, I had an amazing experience with Dr. Nour! I will be a patient of his for life and I will absolutely refer all of my family and friends to him. Thank you for taking such great care of me Dr. Nour!!<//Text>

Trader Joe's has become my favorite place to buy groceries since I moved to the States.
The quality of their products is amazing and the service provided by all their employees is above and beyond.
I like that they have a nice variety of products but not that many that makes the shopping experience overwhelming.
They have tons of local wine and beers at really good and cheap prices.
They also sell products from around the world, which improves the shopping experience.
I would say most of their products are cheaper and better quality than stores like Walmart or Safeway.</text>

This was a first time visit for me at this location. Only stopped in b/c it was conveniently located near the freeway and in the direction of my home. Went  looking for nutmeg (Trader Joe's only carries it during the holidays) and 365 chickenless nuggets. There was an older guy on the floor too busy having a personal call on his Bluetooth to really be bothered. He sent me to the wrong isle. Fortunately there was another man (maybe manager?) that assisted me in locating the items. He immediately turned the negative experience into a positive one. That quick turn around is the only reason why I may return in the future.</text>

Store was fine but I need the cashier to use more critical thinking skills. I get the no bagging policy, but telling me, without a cart, that I can't put my items back into the bag I took them out of, doesn't make any sense. Blindly following rules is not a great customer service experience 🙃</Review>

A great shopping experience before I got in line, but the "bag your groceries outside on these tables" thing is a bit much. Because I brought my own clean washed canvas bags, I had to watch the cashier take out each item from my packed cart, scan it, then place it back into my cart so I could then take it all outside to bag it. Took a long time. There has to be a better way.<//Text>

<text>The cashiers are all very friendly and accommodating. I can now bring my own bags, and they have tables outdoors where you can do your own bagging in a socially distant manner. The waiting line outside is also pleasant because they have nice team members offering bottled water (on heatwave days) and offering you sanitized shopping carts before you go in.</text>< pictures>

It's still the cleanest, most positive place to shop. Although I don't get everything there, it's where I go to cheer up and get really special items.   My daughters stock up on fast, healthy, frozen meals for the dorm!<//Review>

< review>
Ok! I went to this Trader Joe's for the first time. I was in my nursing apparel and had my badge in hand. I simply wanted to stop by and grab a few items after working a long depressing shift. I presented my badge to the gentleman at the door and he tells me that they are no longer allowing essential workers to enter the store and we are to wait as well. Now I normally shop at the Trader Joe's in Fremont but I relocated to Oakland. Now Healthcare workers don't ask for much and I literally ook that as a Slap in the face. I know that ever RN and physician is incredibly pressed for time because we are all working extremely long, exhausting, and chaotic hours. Now you mean to tell me when we get off we have to stand in line 20 - 30 min. before we can go into a store to make some much needed grocery. I declare this was the 1st and last time that I will ever shop at this Trader Joe's. If I was not so tired and depressed about all the patients that I see dying from CVD everyday, I would have left this store without shopping at all. Plus I just wanted to grab a few things to take to work so that I could have something to eat. This World Truly Have Issues especially when you take a simple gesture and discard during such chaotic times!!!<//review>

As expected, the store holds treasures galore with a good produce section and a nice cheese selection. The store is on the smaller size so it feels crowded and the frozen foods section is adequate. I would have liked to have a better frozen section. Over all a great place to shop and grab tasty snacks.< /Review></record>

TJs is one of my favs due to the variety of special items in stock that you can't find at other stores. I also ❣️ the prices that don't fluctuate often. The people are always helpful and cool. It's also nice to see the same friendly faces. I ❤️ the pesto sauce, limeade, chocolate crispy  bars, scallion pancakes and roasted garlic & onion pistachios. 👍🏾🙋🏾‍♀️</Text>

Another wonderful TJ's where you can spend $100 and still have nothing for dinner.  But do try out the frozen dinners. Both the Indian and Italian dinners are very good.  Many helpful folks to answer questions and even take you to the spot.  This store is clean well stocked.</Text>

<Review>The staff is UNBELIEVABLY friendly! I come here strictly for the Mac N Cheese! Too good to pass up, can't find it anywhere else. Love the options that they have for food and drinks, a lot of it is unique to trader Joe's. A little far away for groceries for me but always worth it!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x808f86a53bbd22eb:0xaff5bdfd04fda402</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It's Trader Joe's. Not much to say except they are amazing. The best customer service. Good food, good prices. Fresh produce and salads.
I love everything about Trader Joe's. It can get busy on the weekends but nothing compared to other locations. I like the layout of this store the most. I wished it stayed open until 9:30pm but it is Alameda after all, everything closes early.

Keep up the good work Trader Joe's!

I like their fast checkout and managers are always there to help!<//Review>< gmapID>

< Review>
Customer service has gone down hill for awhile now and keeping groceries stocked continues to be an issue.  Finding products can be haphazard at best. Workers are overworked  and rarely smile. Regardless business continues to be busy, avoid the 5 pm and weekend rush, it's stupid crazy.  Best to stick with tried and true items.  Some are tasty and affordable while some are down right awful.</Review>

Excellent selections of foodstuffs not available in other stores at affordable prices. The Alameda South Shore Center location thoughtfully widened its aisles by moving large produce stands outdoors, which allows the shoppers to keep safe distances and significantly reduces social distancing anxiety!<//review>

<review>Grew to love this chain supermarket. Although not many selections, but what have on shelves are enticing and healthy. Prices are all very reasonable. On top of that, every single staff members are friendly and extremely helpful. Loved the free tasting treats and hot coffee! Good job!

Minimalist shopping. They have lost everything you'll need, and usually only a select number of that individual item.  They don't have 24 varieties of XYZ, so you don't waste your time deciding.  Hot coffee and samples are usually ready.  If you don't know where something is, ask one of three friendly Traders and they'll guide you! My favorite place to shop for birthdays and such, cuz everybody needs whimsical food items and orchids.<//text>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>One of the smallest stores I've visited. Can get super crowded at times making wait times long. Clean store. Don't find very much out of place ever.  Just when you find an item that you like it either gets discontinued or is labeled a "seasonal item" and you never see it again. The layout is always changing so and currently the bread location makes no sense. Staff is super chill and always friendly. Wish they didn't use so much plastic in their packaging. .< /review>< time>

< Review>
A fairly decent sized store that isn't all over packed and tight to navigate thru like some other locations are. The crew is always pleasant. They also offer samples everyday of one or more of their products, which can be a helpful way to find something new you'll like that you couldn't afford to take a chance on buying. Personally, I also love that they help keep our local food bank stocked with all kinds of different items. I am also a client and lucky enough to benefit from their offerings, however, I find their pricing to be quite competitive overall but when it comes to the staples like milk, butter and eggs its hard to find a better deal than Trader Joe's everyday prices.< /Review>

<Review>There are almost always things on my grocery list I need to go next door to Safeway to get, but this Trader Joe's location has better prices on many items, always pretty well stocked, clean, and appropriately staffed so you're not waiting on line very long, even during rush hour. Staff has always been friendly and helpful.< /Review>< Pics>

Everyday I love Trader Joe's more and more
The bread is outstanding and some of their frozen food are fantastic
Try the Indian food, its so good you'd think it's delivery
Don't forget the Mandarin Chicken .... It's amazing
The prices are great too!!<//Review>

Too much plastic packaging is the only thing I don't like about Trader Joe's.  And I still need to hit the normal supermarket when I'm done at TJ's, so I like that there's a Safeway next door to the one in Alameda.<//Text>

< Review>
High rating of course, it's a Trader Joe's. This one is larger than many I've been to and can be very so crowded. However, they are prepared with express lanes for not just 15 and less but 5 and less or something crazy and a line for those without any cart or basket (or is it just a basket?) No matter which lane you're in, the staff here is extra friendly and helpful.</Review>

Favorite place to go for groceries!

Parking: Shares a parking lot with the other stores at the Alameda Shore Center.

Prices: It's not a dollar store, but I think they are pretty decent and worth it. It's definitely cheaper than Whole Foods if that helps you get a better idea of the prices they offer.

The food: Many options. They have organic, gluten free, and vegan options too.

Tip: Please bring a bag to put your groceries in or you will be paying for a grocery bag. California laws, and a good one because we care about the environment.

Will I go again: Yes<//Text>

Very busy but the cashiers do their best to keep things moving. Sometimes the bagged produce can be iffy. Just about always,  there is something rotten included.<//Review>

Like any Trader Joe’s, you get good prices, quick service but a crazy parking lot full of inconsiderate people so beware that aspect. The staff are always to helpful and consistently reliable even in super busy times. We had such a great experience with our cashier. He offered to go get a dip for these chips we were purchasing that we were discussing and saw my obvious regret in not getting it. He had a line and still put our needs first and that really means something to us. Me and my hubby don’t shop anywhere else! I wish the parking lot ran on the same efficiency as the store itself lol</text>

This is the best grocery store! They have everything​ you can imagine and some more. They favor fair trade and have lots of organic products. And added to all of this, they are cheaper than any big bad chain of supermarkets. You won't find any big brand .stuff there, which, in my opinion is great!</review>

<rate>3< /rate><review>This is by far the most congested TJ's I've ever encountered.  Often you have to circle the parking lot for 15 to 20 minutes just to find a space.  Once inside you will wait in line to check out for a minimum of 20 min.  Shopping is like a game of dodge ball.  You cant take your time to browse the shelves because someone wants to squeeze by with thier cart.  If you have options dont shop here!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808f86a53bbd22eb:0xaff5bdfd04fda402</gmapID></record>

Alway friendly staff and stock always nicely kept and stocked. Love how the offer tasting so we can try what goodie they offer....Cause sometimes we buy stuff and we don't like the taste. This allows us to know what is good and what not. However I would highly recommend to write the price tag bigger like apple or fruits is for one not per pound. I noticed a few times new shoppers picking up fruits that is priced each, thinking it's per pound.</Text>

I have only lowered the stars due to the abundance of pre packed produce. I had not noticed that before. The produce ferments/rots and molds faster when packaged/bags. Plus, I still need a Safeway run to get mainstream items. The organic, grass fed poultry and meats rock. The snacks are on point too.</Review>

It's a gem of a store which cohabits peacefully next to Safeways. Always a good selection of wines and cheeses to buy (the two most important aspects of life).</Text>

OMG, this is my local Trader Joe's, which I visit on average five times a week, and somehow I've never reviewed it? How's that possible? Argh!

Trader Joe's store #109 is located in the middle of the South Shore Shopping Center. There's hundreds of parking spots immediately out front. Conveniently located near the corner of Park Street and Otis Drive, this is the to-go spot for dozens of staples, some keto-friendly foods (including grilled artichoke hearts, cheeses, eggs, hamburger, pork tenderloin, turkey breast, and sopressata salami), and the many TJ-specific offerings (including truffle pâte, many really good coffee beans, and seasonal surprises like unsweetened bakers chocolate, cakes and cookies, and mystery bags).

The non-food items, like greeting cards, plants and flowers, and a wide selection of beer, wine, and hard liquors round out any shopping trip.

The staff are absolutely wonderful, know their stock and where they may be found, and are always ready to help you find a TJ treasure. I'm very proud of my local store and hope you come on over to share in the joy.< /text>

To be precise 3.5 stars. That's my overall experience there. I shop there almost everyday.  They could be more organized.</Review>

<Text>Our go-to store. We come here weekly, because they have a good selection of veggies, fruits, meats, cheeses, snacks, beers and wines. Not to mention the staff is really friendly and the store is well kept (compared to Safeway next door where things are all over the place).

It's not pricey and it's convenient since you have a big parking place and many other stores around (in case you can't get everything here). Sometimes they don't have certain things cause they are changing the labels or getting in something new from someone else, but if you ask they might find something in the back or just tell you the date when they're getting it back on their shelves.

The only downside is that perishable things tend to go bad before their expiration date (salads and fruit I'm looking at you) and we do put them in the fridge and take all the necessary precautions.

The lines are not too long because the staff makes sure there's a sufficient number of check-outs open (again compared to Safeway where you have two registers and 20 people). But if you want to avoid the place being too crowded come in right after they open.

I don't care much for the samples they have, but I was told they are also good.

Would highly recommend you to come here instead of going into Safeway next door.<//Text>< name>

Everything with their name on it is delicious or an excellent bottle of booze.
Just stay away from their hippie toilet paper.   That stuff is sandpaper for your butthole.    I feel incredibly fortunate to live so close to their shop.< /Text><Name>Matthew Whatley< /Name>< Rating>

<review>I've been shopping at this Trader Joe's for the last 15 years. Well maintained and well stocked store that consistently provides above average customer service. Unlike some other TJ's in the Bay Area, there's ample parking and more importantly, enough elbow space.< /review><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Good place to pop in and grab a snack, and they have great flowers. However, I'm usually really disappointed in their selection- all the salads but one have meat, so as a vegetarian I'm pretty limited. Also, a lot of the food in the freezer section have modified food starch or msg in them. I'm not at all a health food freak but I do like the minimum amount of additives/artificial crap in my food so it's disappointing when all the tasty looking things are full of nasty stuff. I will say that the staff is very nice and always helps you out if they can. On the whole, I think I'll stick with Safeway but sometimes you really want a Southwest salad<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

OMG, this is my local Trader Joe's, which I visit on average five times a week, and somehow I've never reviewed it? How's that possible? Argh!

Trader Joe's store #109 is located in the middle of the South Shore Shopping Center. There's hundreds of parking spots immediately out front. Conveniently located near the corner of Park Street and Otis Drive, this is the to-go spot for dozens of staples, some keto-friendly foods (including grilled artichoke hearts, cheeses, eggs, hamburger, pork tenderloin, turkey breast, and sopressata salami), and the many TJ-specific offerings (including truffle pâte, many really good coffee beans, and seasonal surprises like unsweetened bakers chocolate, cakes and cookies, and mystery bags).

The non-food items, like greeting cards, plants and flowers, and a wide selection of beer, wine, and hard liquors round out any shopping trip.

The staff are absolutely wonderful, know their stock and where they may be found, and are always ready to help you find a TJ treasure. I'm very proud of my local store and hope you come on over to share in the joy.</text>

One of the best places to shop around. Very good managment. Great prices and lots of yummy food. Their brand is not gmo free certified ( hence lower prices), but they claim that ingredients are GMO free. Some of the items are in a way same idea as popular not so healthy products just better ingredients. Lots of organic produce for  reasonable prices. I’ve  been shopping at TJ’s for so many  years and it still holds that same friendly service and affordable prices for healthy food.<//Review>

<text>I have  been shopping Trader Joes so long, few would remember it was only in the Concord  area and they had a cheese counter where they would cut it for you.  The furthest Trader Joes I visited was New York.  They have 2 stores side by side because  you can't buy liquor in the food store. Both were packed. All in all it's a great place to shop.</text>< pics>

If there is a line at the checkout it means all checkers are open and working at full throttle. Whereas at slowway, there's always a line and 8 checkout stands are empty with no workers.< /text></record>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>i love trader joes, especially if i can manage to go at the lower traffic times. (weekday mornings, especially Wednesday.)

they do a lot of private label stuff, but it is uniformly high quality and lower prices than the equivalent merchandise at safeway or whole foods. the selection is pretty reasonable, but they do not tend to have a lot of specialty products. for example, they have white, crimini, and portabella mushrooms, but no shiitakes.

the other thing they do is stock a smattering of intriguing products, often on a seasonal basis. examples include halumi cheese, Thai chili spiced almonds, and chocolate-covered ginger.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Name>

Maybe it's me, but there only thing I really come here for is produce sometimes. They don't consistently carry a lot of the items I would expect them to have so it's always a hit or miss for me here.
Lines are usually long and move slow on just about every occasion I've come aside from 1 time.< /Review>

A great place to gather signatures for a renter protection ballot measure. The patrons tend to be progressive and sympathetic to the plight of exploited and abused tenants.</review>

Friendly, friendly folks in the Lakeshorehood! I like their prepared meals with attention to minimizing salt in most. New things are seasonally introduced. I do wish they'd label the "lighter" hot spicy things but their return policy is great so not really an issue.< /review>

<text>(Translated by Google) After all it is Tzu.
Food made for autumn. The sweets are orange.
The taste is also excellent.
Food served according to the season is excellent.
However, you have to wait about 7 minutes before entering.

역시 트조입니다.
가을에 맞춰 만든 음식.과자들이 오랜지 색을 입었습니다.
맛 또한 일품입니다.
계절에 맞춰 나오는 음식들이 일품입니다.
그러나 역시 7분정도 기다렸다가 들어가야합니다.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>
