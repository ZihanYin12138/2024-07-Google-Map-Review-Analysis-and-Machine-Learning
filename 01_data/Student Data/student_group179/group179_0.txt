Waited too long for one piece of fish and two shrimp ..15 min or more.And whats up with tiny containers.When i pulled my food out of the tiny bag some of my food fell on the floor. And they didnt give knapkins. Food was hot but just ok. I wont be back.If you cant afford knapkins and bigger containers for food try another line of work.

Fish was ok

Tarter sauce was just ok

There were people behind the counter not wearing masks.

I asked for ketchup and was handed a single packet of ketchup for my meal.< /review>

Best fish and chips around. Zucchini, prawns, sesame balls, crispy crab and cream cheese won tons great. Love the shrimp won ton soup. Real shrimp in the won tons not just in the broth.</Review>

One of the few tru fish and chips places in the bay area .family owed and been in business  at least 35 years.  Every order is cooked after it is taken so its fresh and hot.They even bring in extra help during Lent before Easter because of the extra business that occurs. Whenever im in Newark working on a project i ma ke it a point to stop and eat. I fully recommend 101 fish & chips to any fish lover out there.<//review>

I personally like this place so much.  It is quite, family owned cafe wher you can always find fresh and not expensive meals with a fish or chicken and sides. They are located right on the corner of Home Depot ( same building) open late. Don’t miss your chance to stop and try their food. Thanks< /text>

Pleasantly surprised!  The food was great and not greasy.  I had the clams and they were not chewy or rubbery and not crispy...very good.  My partner had the fish, also very good.  I had reservations when I saw the chips/fries already made, but they were crisp.  They gave us wet wipes and we didn't need them!!!  That is a great sign for a fish and chips place></text>

I had a craving for fish and chips once (don't ask), and found out about this place. It's pretty close to where I live so I decided to try it. The food is just meh. You can tell the food isn't fresh, which is very important for fish and seafood. The food took forever even though there weren't many customers when I came in. Overall I won't go back again.< /text>

Very greasy. Seafood obviously made from frozen. Fried oysters even worse, small heavily breaded frozen store bought. No restrooms?!?! The place must have changed since it was reviewed by others. Very disappointed. However cute place, very clean.< /Review>

Ii wasn't busy so my food was done rather quickly. The food was your everyday run of the mill fish and chips and the shrimp were tough. I will revisit this place and try something different on the menu but I won't recommend it to anyone. Just my thoughts</Text>

I have patronized this restaurant for many years and have noticed that the quality of the food has declined to the point where I am trying to find an alternative place for fish and chips. Today, the food tends to be overlooked with rubbery texture and excessive oil. Th chips, on the other hand, tend to be slightly undercooked<//text>

Close to "real" chips shops. A little kitchy, a bit smelly of fresh cod and used oil, exactly as I remember as a kid. I wasn't sure what to expect seeing the place run by asian folks, what do they know about English food? but I took a chance and I'm glad I did. Friendly fast service, very tasty fish and near perfect chips.
In fact I think I'll go back today for lunch.<//Text>

<Review>Saddest fish I've eaten at a fish'n'chips place in a long time. Two rectangular overcooked slabs that were so greasy they wouldn't even absorb any malt vinegar. I do better at home. I guess I'm spoiled by having lived close to Duke of Edinburgh in Cupertino for many years, but gosh darn it, British-style fish'n'chips just isn't that hard to cook. I feel sorry for the owners of this place, they clearly have no clue as to what they're doing wrong and why people are staying away, but I can't recommend their food.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808fbf0606c4eb23:0x863524a6efe9d192</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Fish was old. Lumpia was not authentic. Chinese owners couldn't speak or understand English and they charged extra for a cup of ice & extra  tartar sauce. I asked for some plain mayonnaise but they didn't know the words mayo or mayonnaise. Good luck in checking the bill cuz they didn't write one up just an x next to words like ice, soda, to go & then they hand you the cash register receipt with total amount due and nothing else. This place rips you off with hidden costs. I'll never eat hear here again.<//Text>

Food took a long to come out after order has been placed.  These heavily battered, small, old fish lacked any taste.  The not traditional tartar sauce, tasted like miracle whip.  Not only were the fish small, the chips portion was lacking as well.  You get what you pay for.<//Review>

<Review>This was the WORST Fish and Chips I ever tasted bar none. The “fish” was not freshly battered and was the kind of pre-battered fish you buy in the frozen fish department…. barely edible and the “chips” where previously fried and re fried for my order. The lumpia was mini—which the sign did not state and were burnt. The burnt lumpia was the result of frying the rolls with both ends open instead of the correct way—both ends closed, hence the hot oil burned both ends and all one can taste is the burnt beef. Shame!!!!!!!!!  Zero stars if I could give Zero stars I would.  My 3-piece fish and order of Lumpia cost me over $15.00 and I threw it away as it was not fit for human consumption.

Please avoid this establishment at all costs—wish I have looked up the rating prior to losing my money—it was an awful experience.< /Review><response>None</response>< UserId.>

<Text>Troy was excellent in customer service giving me a free and quick estimate and gave me tips and advice on what to do with insurance and repair for my vehicle. He also gave me daily updates as my vehicle was being worked on. It was great to find out he is a Marine Veteran and I thank him for his service.< /Text><rate>5<//rate>< pictures>

Its been quite a while since I have done business with a company that leaves a good enough impression for me to take the time to write a review.  White Oaks went above and beyond from start to finish.  Very welcoming, easy to talk to and deal with.  They kept me informed through the whole process and provided helpful information for working with my insurance company.  I was so impressed, I brought my 2nd  car over for minor repairs when my initial repairs were complete.  Needless to say it was another great experience.  I am a customer for life as long as these guys are running the show!  Thanks again White Oaks!!<//Text>

Mike and team were phenomenal from consultation to completion.  They took the time to listen to my concerns around buffing and repainting, walked me through what was needed on my end beforehand (ordering paint from BMW), and finished the job in less than a half hour.  Most importantly, my car looks brand new!<//Review>

I towed my 4runner that got smashed in a head on collision to this shop per the tow driver's advice.  I'm glad I took his advice because White Oaks Auto Body is easy to deal with and they even grabbed a couple items I forgot to take out for me.  The vehicle was being towed to Copart and they took my garage door opener and fav CD out before it got towed, and I was able to come by and get my items without any issue.

When I was 39.5 weeks pregnant, my Volvo SUV was rear ended getting off the freeway. What could have been a very stressful ordeal was made easy by them. They kept me in the loop with every step of the process and put me at ease that everything would be taken care of.

I have used them for minor work on my previous car too (6 series BMW). They always do great work. They leave my cars looking and running just as they should.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1614376834576, 'text': 'Thank you for the kind words and trusting us with your vehicles!

Danny and Mike are two incredibly friendly and helpful people. I brought my car in for an estimate on a damaged front headlight and bumper. They worked diligently to get in touch with my insurance company, who unfortunately are not the most responsive bunch. Danny and Mike made the process so easy for me. They communicated well through phone and text. They also recognized that I was a healthcare worker and offered to fix a dent on my passenger door free of charge! I was so touched by their kindness. When I picked up my car, I was ecstatic to see that it was beautifully washed and waxed, and looked brand spanking new!

I would 1000% recommend this place for any auto body work!<//Review>

I got my Prius engine splash shield messed up after running on a curb. This shop did a great job fixing it with a fast turnaround time and a reasonable price. Very friendly and honest people to deal with. Recommend if you you need to have any body work done.<//review>

They will give you an accurate assessment backed with integrity, professionalism and empathy towards your situation while trying to do everything they can to ensure you are taken care of. Our family will only be using White Oaks for all future car needs. Thanks Mike!</Text>< pics>

So happy I found this location! Mike, Mark and Tony were very helpful from day one.

I was in a car accident,  didn't know the area or where to have my car brought as I was on my way to the hospital (some A Hole rear ended me at a stop light going 45+ mph) I asked the tow driver if he recommended anyone,  he told me about white oak, and that it would be okay to have an overnight drop there.  First thing the next day they called me letting me know they had the car,  giving me well wishes and letting me know I could stop by any time.  They took care of everything.

You know that horrible violated feeling you get when your car is stolen or damaged.... They made all of that go away. Everyone was so warm and polite I could almost forget why I had to go there in the first place.</review>

< Review>
Had the absolute pleasure of working with Mike from White Oaks Auto Body! I'd go back to their shop in a heartbeat- although I hope I won't have to. He got my Mazda Mp3 looking tip-top after the bumper had to be replaced, hood dented, wheel well/fender completed messed up, and it had a broken headlight.
I made the mistake of going somewhere else first ... *ehem*  caliber *ehem*... who appear to be part of a insurance scheme because they immediately declared my car "totalled" following a fender bender- after the lady looked at it for like 2 minutes. This decision made by the Caliber Collision estimator was obviously rushed and a sweet deal for them because they either 1) want to get the biggest check from the insurance company or 2) don't want to actually do work that requires true effort. Forget about the fact that they only made 1500 of my model (from 2001) and that it has at least another 100k to go before I want to consider getting rid of it. This decision made by their representative is also causing me extra hardship now because I have to take the car to the DMV before I can get it legally reinstated to be driven in the state.
I went to Mike and he made (almost) all of these problems go away. He gave me an honest estimate, provided me with multiple options depending on how much I really wanted to spend, and kept me updated throughout the entire process. Now my car is back home and it looks better than when I initially purchased it 3 1/2 years ago... White Oaks & Mike have my respect and I certainly recommend going straight to these guys whenever you are looking to assess OR repair damage.< /Review>

<Text>I've been coming to White Oaks Auto Body for years. Mark has always gone far and beyond with any repairs / insurance work I needed in the past. Just recently had a tree limb fall on the roof of my Lexus LS460 and called and setup appt to take it in. Met Mike for the first time and he as well went far and beyond to make sure my car was repaired properly and in a timely manner. Took care of all the insurance work and had my vehicle back to new in less than a week. Excellent customer service and impeccable work. These guys really make you feel like family. I will always be bringing my vehicles back to them as long as they are around. Highly recommend this family business.< /Text><user_name>Dan B.< /user_name><pics>None<//pics><UserId.>115449384671760647128<//UserId.>< rating>

Mike, thank you for your Professionalism, kindness and knowledge. The customer service and quality was above and beyond my expectations . If anyone needs their car fixed after damage go to this place. I give them a 15 on a scale of 1-10! From the time I walked in from the beginning to end the service is TOP Notch and I didnt have to wait long. I will refer my family and friends if they ever need repair for their cars.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Name>

Troy told me to bring it in and he'll pop it back into place. When I arrived, he greeted me right away, did a quick inspection, said he'd bring it into the garage and to give him a few minutes. He said to wait in the lobby where I was greeted by a very friendly woman who offered me coffee and water. I was in the office no more than 10 minutes and Troy pulled up to the office with the bumper perfectly back in it's place. Then he said I was good and didn't even charge me for his time! Earlier in the day another auto body shop quoted me $150 to reattach the bumper and that it would take 1-2 hours so I'd need to schedule an appointment. I'm so happy that I stopped into this shop! Highly recommended!</Review>< Pictures>

Mark and White Oaks Auto Body went above and beyond to repair my Tesla Model S. Tesla has a bad reputation of getting parts out to repair shops. I was expecting it to take months, when Mark and White oaks were able to get everything in about 2 weeks. A day to put on all the new parts and a day to paint and blend it flawlessly to the rest of the car. Fantastic work.<//text>

Great experience! Troy got the estimate done quickly and the repair was done in the time that was estimated.  Work was outstanding!  Prices are competitive and the work is great.  Would strongly reccomend White Oaks for auto body repairs.</Text>

I have owned and personally run this shop with Help from my son, daughter and wife. I’ve had the same Bodyman, painters and detailer for all ten years. I’ve had to add an estimator with years of experience on the insurance side of the collision industry. I’ve gone thru numerous general managers to finally find the most competent man to fill my shoes. I’ve spend two years grooming him to treat every customer as if they were the only customer. To call every customer each day and give updates. But most of all to be proud of the quality on each and every job that goes in and out of my shop. I personally guarantee every repair with a lifetime warranty. I will be taking time off this upcoming year but Mike or Troy can fill my shoes. I want to thank all my employees and all my thousands of satisfied customers. Mark< /Review>

I had a chip repair and paint job done to my C7 Corvette carbon fiber roof. This place has some of the best customer service I have ever experienced from any business for any service. I ask a lot of questions I never felt rushed, and I was called each day with updates. Troy and Amanda treated me like family and Marks repair work was flawless.

Great customer service and high quality repairs. Our Rav4 was backed into, both passenger doors were dented. White Oaks replaced the door panels, matched the paint and now you'd never know. They managed the insurance, rental process and provided great status updates. I recommend you bring a damaged vehicle in for an estimate.<//Text>

Took my car in for a quick estimate to fix the scratches on the rear bumper. They greeted me nicely when I came in the office. One of the guys came to look at my car and said the scratches could be polished off, and he offered to get it done on the sport for free! An excellent service is when you're offered something you didn't expect. Thank you, guys.</review>

<Text>This is hands down the best auto body shop that I have been too. I picked my car up on Tuesday and not only did the outside look beautiful and brand new, the interior did as well. My car even smells brand new inside. The owner is very friendly and always took the time to talk to me when I was at the shop and he even personally called me to give me an update on my car's status of repairs while it was there in the shop. I highly recommend this shop and I will take my car here if it is ever in need of repair again.<//Text><user>113449471622831681796</user><rating>5< /rating>< pictures>

I took my sons car in to get a repair estimate.  The owner cleaned off the rubber tire marks on the quarter panel, reattached the fender and told me there was no need to replace the wheel well panel.  All at no cost!.  Great, honest service.

Took my truck in to have the fender looked at. The paint had started to flake off.  They took it in did the job in expediently, washed it, and brought it up for me to drive away.  I’m pleased with the results and their customer service. They were very attentive and followed through with me along the way. Truck was ready a day before they estimated. I will refer people to them which is as high a review I think any business can get.<//Review>

<Text>White Oaks fixed my car after I was in a rear end accident. They are professional and quickly fixed my hood, bumper, front fender, and passenger signal light in less than the estimated time period (5 days). My car was done in 4 and a half days. My car looks like it is brand new! My car was washed and wiped down inside as well. I highly recommend them if you need body work after an accident. I believe you will not be disappointed either.< /Text>< username>

< review>
First time at this Vital location was this past Sunday and my husband and I enjoyed this gym -- the routes were fun and offered challenges. We recently joined in on my brother-in-law's family plan and got our annual membership on Black Friday to the Vital gyms (great deal and very excited about our new memberships!). The staff are friendly and all locations are enjoyable for climbing -- I'm comfortable with v2 and working on v3; my husband is v4-6; and my brother and sister-in-laws are v5-8. All the Vital locations are welcoming to dogs and my in-laws bring their toddler -- we always have a good time. There's routes for all ranges of climbers -- beginner to expert. Highly recommended!<//review>

I'm a member, I go climbing 3 times a week. This is one of their smaller locations -they recently opened a new spot in Oceanside with a LOT of space. But I've made my little community here. Climbers and staff alike are super friendly, if you ask for help they'll help you out. The staff here are knowledgeable about climbing and everyone just wants to have a good time.
Parking can be difficult sometimes, thee are dance studios next door and a LOT of parents waiting and blocking space when dance class is ending, but if you have to walk a bit farther it's still not too far. But the flip side is sometimes you show up and it's empty.
Open hours are 11 AM to 9 PM, then as a member you get 24 hour access. Which is another huge perk. I love the opportunity to climb early in the morning or late at night depending on my schedule.</review>

Awesome small spot to boulder climb.  24 hours with friendly helpful people showing me the correct form.  Only downside is price keeps going up.  But it's worth the investment.<//text>
<Response>{'time': 1522874575612, 'text': 'Hi Sonny! Thank you for your review, and glad you enjoyed the gym. We would LOVE to keep the price the same forever, but as we add new programs and features like our gym remodeling last year, we adjusted our prices accordingly. We still make sure our day prices are on the affordable side for a climbing gym, and we make sure to keep anyone who continues an auto-pay membership at the lower monthly rate. Hope this clarifies the pricing changes!'}</Response>< pics>

Fun place to go even if you don't know what bouldering is at 1st. We always go on Fridays when they have a discount which makes it a cheep fun thing to do. It's also super cute with a mini gym drink station and couches.<//review>

Really awesome small gym, love that it's 24/7. Only bouldering but fine for a good workout at 2am. Only downsides is that it doesn't cater well to more advanced climbers (v7 and up) and it doesn't have a campus board< /Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1522874977072, 'text': "Hi Bryan! Glad to see you taking advantage of the 24/7 accessibility.  Our setters do their best to cater to the majority of the climbers that visit, and since most climbers are in the v4-v7 range, then that is the range that will have the most quantity of climbs. Great on you though for being able to crush the v8+ climbs. As you probably know, Carlsbad is our very first location, hence it's small size.  We would love to have a campus board here, but there just isn't any room. This is definitely a big reason why we opened the newer and more spacious location in Oceanside, for more climb quantity and the space for campus boards among other things!"}< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dc72e6e3169347:0xa3c8ea3d32b64329<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Wow!  I have gone to other World Markets before and I like this one so far.  The way they decorated was very open an full of light. They do have so much products it is amazing. I like the fast that is so close to home and when ever I feel like eating German food or any other different foods they carry them. It is nice, they staff is nice and Kind.  When I asked them is I could take pictures the young lady at the counter ask me to please ask her manage and Marisol was so awesome!   I asked her if I could take pictures she said please do!   I love how nice she was and how graciously she allowed me to take pictures.  Some stores don't let you take pics or are a bit weird.  When it came to my shopping experience was very rewarding.  Their prices are decent and you can find all kinds of different stuff.  I am not a Wine, beer or liquor connoisseur I enjoy my little drink here and there with my wife and at dinner, let me tell you this guys have a lot to chose from.  Their prices were reasonable and the shopping experience was very nice, I am planning on bringing my wife next time I am sure she will love it!< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMoCOyotkghlQR50x91-Qk50cc4e71HNrSeHYw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1zHJCBQs88cq9gwWdY8GFDWh0DjXJVGDJybIO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8jop1dDwa9ZSoKw0xhObw0m9VQrxm7Ysxk6e2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9ceRnJkMwbTWgPH1EMdYsrm5mIhy-Wp8-GACc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOj2PrR7piNP83QOFRq9KoymftcshzUgDcyqBpX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnr0dZ3khS5tP5jCwqX315Gt2iJNErAgaoMvtY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-xjkOCNYtpsrpZBPqbjncXAHokNiQPwmBVhMi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxBaIsjDB5SXuxX1g0H0BHzQLgYkbEtGoD4RJN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6FZW4nK0L_QsR5tQczLMeUMLa6_d7_m9vw_hh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCA9axEC9WQfh9EonmW7PSmpNZi1QIncmkNVDA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIsJhhY25Wi9yp_XtHBuZVkQt5WQkGsucOwFOQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnuI1H_--QmQid50dQt-3O5X_MDSxv6vPtyjYI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUIxtG_7eUWG0yKhTTnznNCKdHATFX7BfB_Wbl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb3MANqHGxpAyam-HcOZEjxXQa5FDDd4UXKvg4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80d945b6919bbb19:0xfbfcfb60b2b9574f</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Loved the experience.  Very helpful staff. Ready to help in getting something there or when/if out of stock, are very willing to help you with your online order.

<Review>This is a great place to find foods from overseas. It can be pricey compared to purchasing online from other sources, but there are coupons and an awards program, and it's great when you need something immediately and don't want to wait for it to be shipped. They have samples for customers to try sometimes.

There is also a lot of home decor, also pricey, but some really fun stuff, as well as small furniture. Their soaps and candles are nice.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>World Market in Chula Vista is a new location right across from the Otay Ranch mall, off of Birch. The place is extremely beautiful with a great selection. There is something there from around the world, so you may be able to find what you are looking for. There are exotic coffee brands from various parts of the world, so if you're into exotica coffees, you may find something that may appease your palate. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this store, so if you are in the Otay Ranch area, give this place a visit and browse around.

< Review>
This store is so beautiful! As with any store just opening and working out their kinks, it’s helpful to remember things will always be changing and evolving. I am a regular world market shopper and love how the store alway has some of the same things we are always looking for but new things coming in all the time. The Chula Vista world market  has been much needed in the South Bay and every time we have been in, everyone has been so friendly and halepful! Looking forward to see how the store continues to grow and change. Especially the beer and wine selections!</Review>

<UserId.>118406297752557564310< /UserId.><text>(Translated by Google) It has a little small aisles for all the things they sell. Thousands of articles from different parts of the world at a variety of prices. Wide selection of wines. Clean and good service. Ample hours and parking. Perhaps because it was the opening date there were many people buying and huge rows to pay. Hopefully later there will be more promotions.

Dope place they have official gear no rip offs what so ever. Some items may be over priced but I don't mind helping out a small business. Would definitely recommend for anything soccer related they got most national team jerseys as well.< /review>

< Review>
Great place to get some gear or purchase jerseys and soccer stuff (gifts and so on)....  prices are good- average- no real big savings compared to other soccer stores. Service was decent; staff is friendly but limited when it gets really busy. Store may seem a bit crowded but it's because they have a large inventory on the floor and it is a small store.  Either way you can still find what you're looking for; might just take you a minute more.  Will definitely come back again.< /Review>

You can’t try on the clothes, all the shirts are zip tied to the hangers and they don’t have fitting rooms for pants. I wanted some sort of black shorts and sweats but had literally zero size mediums in any black bottoms they sold. Very limited and staff seemed very uninterested in everything.< /text>

All The Reviews Are True I've Been Going Here Since I Was Little & They Have Always Been Pretty Expensive. They Won't Always Have The Newest Cleats But They Do Have Variety In Other Stuff & Lastly The Owner😐So You Guys Know Who She Its An Old Nigerian Lady Who Always Seem To Be Cranky & It's Just Her. I Hope She Decides To Retire B/c She Is The Main Problem & That's Why I Stopped Going Here< /review>

If it were possible to give zero stars, I would.  The store is over priced and they’re stealing from people. They purposely ripped off the price tags and when I went to a different location the same item and it was 30 dollars less.  The customer service was also disgusting and they treated people very poorly.</text>

<Text>So I was looking for a pair of indoor soccer shoes and I called yesterday at around 7:50PM. I wanted the shoes for a birthday present for today. Whoever answered the phone (male) told me that he had the shoes size 8 in the store. I went in today to buy them. I was the first one in the store. The person working this morning tells me that he did not have the shoes in the store but could be ordered in by tomorrow. I was upset because he was trying to sell me an 8.5 when I said no. That is BS I drove 30 minutes to get the shoes size 8 that were confirmed last night by the employee and it was a freaking lie.  I do not recommend this store to anyone. The shoes are cheaper on Amazon.< /Text>< userid>

<review>they are top notch with their customer service. they went out of their way to deliver some merchandise from their LA store to Van Nuys so  that i wouldnt have to drive down there to not only make the purchase, but to pick up as well. Will def shop here again!

Thank you Soccer Shop USA

Price gougers because they raised the price of a jersey just because that particular team was playing that day. They raised it 30 dollars than the original price. Made me feel uncomfortable. Horrible costumer service. Went to Soccer Stores in Granada Hills and got the same jersey for 30 dollars less!!<//Text>

Never coming again. Owner is very rude. No customer service from her part. Seems a bit racist and ready to retire. Don't come to work if you're tired of your job . And everything is over priced by at least 10 bucks</text>

<Time>1347735890062</Time><pictures>None</pictures><review>as soon as i walked is i was asked if i was looking for anything specific. I was looking for a blue nike ball and right away she knew what i was talking about. Very friendly. There were about 5 other people in there but she was on top of things. as soon as i tried on some shoes she helped someone out and by the time i was taking the shoes off she was there to ask if everything was ok. i ended up going for a ball and came out with a netherlands jersey and some indoor soccer shoes. How can you resist when their so nice. will be shopping here again soon. for all my jerseys.</review><Name>Eduardo Alvarez</Name>< GmapID>

Came for a 10 minute buy. Had to wait an extra 50 minutes because of the name and number pressing that should take only 10 minutes. Horrible customer service. They do not help at all.< /Review>

<Text>I just completed the 6 week challenge with DC fitness. It was a total success - so I wanted to share my story to not only show appreciation for the program, but to also advise others others look to achieve their fitness goals.

Moving to LA a year and a half ago was difficult. It was a move I had to make, but the challenges that come with a cross country move took a toll on my mind and body.

2 months ago, I came across one of those Instagram ads about getting fit in 6 weeks. I was skeptical, but I needed to get fit. As a constant athlete growing up, I was not happy with where my body was at and needed a change. So I put the money down and was all in.

The program offers 3 main facets: Fitness, Nutrition, and Accountability.  Working out 3 times a week with the DC team ended up becoming some I looked forward to, rather that something I dreaded. This was because It was only a 45 minute-1 hour work out where I knew I would maximize my time. I was able to build great relationships with each trainer, who truly cared able my progress and success. I was surprised by how supportive all the other gym members were as well - but I guess that what happens when there is a mutual goal.

Stay true to the regiment this program lays out for you, and you will see results in 6 weeks. I recommend the challenge to anybody looking to improve their physical and mental health, through a challenge that provides all the necessary tools to succeed.

This place is amazing and the absolute best price value in SF! Super high quality body pump instructors -- each with a unique style. I am a body pump convert! The results have been phenomenal and I owe it to Joe, Peggy, Erica, Maury, Brian and Megan!  If you're sitting on your sofa or at your desk with a bag of chips, you  must try this gym and body pump!</text>

<time>1565223039670<//time><rate>4< /rate><Text>I participated in Dylan's 6 week challenge at the beginning of May 2019 and lost 26.4 lbs & 7.5% body fat. This was the best $798 I ever spent on my body as I needed that push to finally get the body I've always wanted. Because I was able to pass his initial challenge, I got to keep and roll over the $798 for another 6 weeks of personalized meal plans and work out plans. Throughout this 12 weeks, Dylan helped remotely to keep me on track by motivating me with constructive criticism on my photos of my meal prep and body progress photos. I never received an in person work out session at his gym, that is extra so this program ultimately depends on you putting in the work. I could not afford to continue on with Dylan after the challenge with his plans as they were out of my price point significantly. . I wish there was more affordable plans available especially with at least one in person session at his facilities but if I get some extra disposable income down the road, I'll be back to check if he's got any special promos running. If you are serious to lose the weight and able to put some skin in the game, definitely worth the investment on yourself.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>I just completed the 6 week challenge at DC fitness and I couldn’t be more impressed with my results. The trainers are awesome and kept me motivated. The diet plan was key in me losing weight and body fat and super easy to follow. Spencer, my accountability coach was checking in with me a few times each week and he really helped keep me on track! I lost 9 pounds and 6.1 percent body fat. I definitely recommend this gym. It’s a great community and will help you reach your goals fast!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
Dylan and his team at DC fitness are amazing. I love working out there because the trainers really push you in a friendly but rigorous way to go beyond your own self-imposed limitations. I gained muscle mass and for the first time in many years I got to see signs of my six pack. It's not a full blown six pack but I am very happy with my results. Nutrition plays a big role during this fitness challenge journey. A fat free diet is key when you are committed to your goal of getting lean, provided that is what works for you. For me it did. I am not a keto diet person so I could do fat free. The workouts are awesome, balanced, strong and I feel like a million bucks  every time I leave the gym. A lot of sweat, particularly on leg days. I get to see my arm muscles too, which I love. Dylan, thank you. DC Fitness rocks!!!<//Review>

<Text>I recently completed my 6 week challenge with DC fitness. Is losing 6% fat in 6 weeks possible? I wasn’t sure. By following the meal plans provided and attending 3 sessions per week, I managed to successfully finish my challenge. What is more important is that now I have established healthy habits that I can continue to follow. The trainers will push you hard enough to get the results, and they are friendly and helpful. If you are in doubt, I highly recommend that you would give DC Fitness a try. Thanks Dylan and his team for a life changing experience!</Text>< gmapID>

I just want to drop a shoutout to Alex Osborne as he is one of the best trainers I've had since I moved to the bay area. He has a way with his words to encourage and inspire you to push a little harder. That's what I appreciate most about him as a trainer and most importantly, as a friend.</review>

This program is NO JOKE. With the help of the DC trainers and a lot of self control and hard work I was able to loose 25lbs and 7% body fat. I cannot recommend the team here more. The accountability coaching helps you stay on track every day and the workouts motivate you. Every person that I met along this journey was awesome and I look forward to continuing the relationships built here. Thank you so much to the DC that helped me make it happen. I can't speak more highly of DC Fitness and just know that if you stick to the program you will GET RESULTS!</text>< pics>

<Review>I was VERY skeptical coming into DC Fitness because the challenge sounded so difficult to do and maintain. What I found was a space where I was not judged, incredibly kind and encouraging trainers who cheered me on, and a diet plan that is logical and gave me options that had me dropping weight unlike any other plan I’d tried. I always thought I’d have to spend hours in the gym to get results, but it was really manageable. The program works and everyone is there to support you. You don’t have to show up dressed to impress like some other private gyms - no one is pretentious. When I fell off the wagon with my diet, the managers got me on track right away. Highly recommend, this is not a gimmick like I feared. It even dramatically improved my sleep, which was a crazy added benefit. If you put in the work here, you WILL see results!!< /Review>< Pics>

I received encouragement during the introduction and everything they said was true.  The trainers were super friendly and knowledgeable, I  received motivating messages in between work outs to see how I was doing with both work outs and diet, the vibe at the gym was great and the other clients were very friendly creating a mutually supportive environment.  This was one of the best things I have done in 2020 by far.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I recommend DC Fitness to anyone who:
- Wants to make positive change to their physical (and mental) health
- Wants to love to work out
- And might need a kick in the butt to do so :)

The team is a group of awesome, personable people who are great at what they do, and have a really fun time doing it. No negative pressure, good vibes only! I was honestly skeptical of the 6-week program at first, but my leap of faith was rewarded with a new good habit and a surprisingly good body :P During the 6 weeks I met my goal of 6% body fat loss! Thanks especially to Terrence and Brent who kept me honest, positive, and constantly pushing. <3 DC Fam!<//review><pics>None</pics>< Gmap_id>

<review>I just completed the 6 week challenge and could not be happier with the results. I lost the 6% body fat (and then some) all thanks to the excellent training staff and accountability coaching at DC Fitness. The gym has an incredibly encouraging and accepting atmosphere and each of the trainers do a great job of meeting every individuals needs within each session. The accountability coaching was something that was new to me but really helped me achieve the results I was looking for. I highly recommend the gym and the challenge to anyone looking to jump start their fitness routine.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Date>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I cannot recommend DC Fitness enough.

I started my diet and exercise plans 6 weeks ago and finished up this Wednesday weighing out 21.6lbs lighter and lost 8.1% body fat.  The support from Dylan and all the team was marvelous, always there to check in, help and keep me motivated.

I'm looking forward to seeing the benefits of my new 9 week fat burning and strength training push, and attending my classes each week.

Thank you to all the team and family for your support and encouragement.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I was looking for a structured program that I could push myself physically and see real results by the end of it. The last 6 weeks have been challenging and required real commitment, but was totally worth it! The combination of the diet plan + the consistent workouts make a big impact. The trainers were great and encouraged me to get better each time. I was able to surpass my goal and hit an 8.2% loss in body fat! I would encourage anyone who's looking for a structured program to try it out! Huge shout out to Terrence and the rest of the team for all the support!</Review>

I can not say enough good things about DC Fitness.  The trainers are exceptional.  I have scoliosis and the trainers always made sure my form was good keeping me injury free.  Everything is customized to help you achieve your goals.  I lost 20 lbs in 12 weeks and have never felt better! I typically get bored with repetitive workouts.  The workouts are fun, challenging, and different every single class.  The atmosphere is great with a community feel.  Everyone encourages each other and it really does help keep you motivated for the long haul.<//Review>

I completed the 6 week challenge @ DC Fitness and exceeded my goal of 6% body fat lost, coming in at 6.3%, with ~17lbs down from my starting weight!

Everyone, both staff and folks at the gym, are positive, friendly, and encouraging.  That, paired with everyone's knowledge and the mid-workout laughter made this challenge more than I had hoped for. Big props to all the trainers and folks who are a part of the DC family. Y'all made this so much fun.  My trainer was Terrence, but they are all fantastic and I know I would be in great hands with any of them!

If you want to challenge yourself, have fun, and have the dedication to put towards this, definitely recommend.  They're a fantastic group of folks!</Review>

The best Fitness CA location in the city in my opinion. Plenty of equipment so that you don't have to wait, everything is clean and lots of cardio machines. Locker room was clean and had options for shampoo, conditioner, etc. I have now started going out of my way to drive to this location despite other FitnessS CA being closer.< /review>

DC Fitness is high quality. I loved the focus on the Nutritional side of the process. I did the six week challenge to get back to my high energy, athletic Broadway Dancer shape and I’m almost there. At 55 years young I lost 11.8 pounds and lots of inches. All this with an injured wrist and a sore back. Dylan even gave me alternate workouts to strengthen my area that were weak using bands when I could lift weights. I am super happy with the results. Take the challenge with Dylan at DC Fitness. You won’t be sorry!</Text>

What an amazing experience from start to finish. I had been trying for months to get into a groove and feel better about myself. I participated in the 6-week challenge with another coworker, and let me tell you...it works. The workouts were always great, the trainers were always attentive, and the DC family was always there to support you every step of the way. Over 20lbs down and 8% loss in body fat, I crushed all expectations beyond my imagination. DC Fitness isn't a quick way to lose weight but a great program for anyone needing that edge or the extra push to start seeing the results. My biggest issue was not fitting into my clothes and now I have the problem of needing new clothes...it's a good issue and an even better feeling. I cannot thank everyone enough.</Review>

I had an outstanding experience at DC Fitness. Wanted to drop some extra weight, and from the first session I felt supported by the entire staff in reaching my goals. The workouts were challenging and fun, and the diet plan I was given was simple, sensible, and easy to follow. I saw great results in just six weeks — nearly 20 pounds and over 7% body fat lost. Highly recommend!</Review>

I participated in the 6 week body challenge at DC Fitness after seeing an ad for a local gym on Instagram.

I have nothing but good things to say about this gym. From Day 1 I felt the support of the awesome staff. Dylan laid out what I was to expect in the coming weeks. Right off that bat I was given a meal plan and online resources to get me up to snuff.

The 18 workouts start out as a kick in the face but really become enjoyable somewhere around week 2. The best part of this whole experience was the extremely supportive training staff. They all have different styles and approaches to workout classes which kills the monotony of a traditional gym routine.

I was easily able to gain 10lbs without upping my body fat % in a short amount of time.

Do your body and mind a favor and get to know this awesome gym and the people behind it.<//Review>

DC Fitness was a life-changing experience! When I first started I was 208.6 pounds eating junk and not working out at all. I decided to try a 6-week challenge and boy did it pay off. The moment I walked in, I felt right at home! Meeting with Dylan Conrad about some of the goals I wanted to reach and he was always positive and keeping me up to date on what I needed to do nutrition wise. Also, I had a wonderful Accountability coach in Sequoia, who always kept me motivated even on days I thought I could not push myself. I am proud to say my weight is 182.6! I recommend this place to all my friends and family to definitely check out DC Fitness!< /text>

<Review>6 week challenge COMPLETE!

I began the challenge at 185.8 lbs, 30.8% BF ended at 169.2, 24.8% BF! The journey seemed a little intimidating but the DC Team are all great at being super supportive, uplifting, and there every step of the way. All the coaches are awesome, but I got to give special thanks to my accountability coach, Terrence. He’s just a true all star. Aside from the coaches, the OG’s/people on the challenge with you have your back just as much and having that comfortable yet driven community pumps great challenge crushing energy for everyone all around. Thank you DC for this lifestyle change milestone that together we conquered!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

When I began the 6-week challenge I had no idea how much I would grow physically and mentally. DC Fitness is a great place for anyone trying to achieve their fitness goals at any fitness level. As someone who has always struggled with weight, I was able to lose 25.2lbs over the 6 weeks at the gym. The trainers really care and are always there to support you on your fitness journey. DC fitness provides a team atmosphere, support, and passion to create a winning fitness formula. I recommend this gym to anyone looking to reach their fitness goals.< /text>

At first when I came across the Dc fitness 6-week challenge I wasn't hesitant about the veracity of the results, I saw it as a big challenge on myself. From the moment I walked in I felt right about it, for me "customer service" has always been a big deal and the smallest thing from being greeted made me feel at ease.
A little about myself, I have always been passive about my fitness and have never seen myself as the type to do anything active, but for several reasons I needed to challenge myself. DC Fitness provided everything I needed to get to where i wanted to be and that is to be stronger. With the meal plan and coaching provided I was able to go from 31.9% to 25.2% body fat , and a 12lbs weight loss. I am so grateful to have found DC fitness because they were the catalysts for this momentous change f my life. I am so grateful for Ambra, Terrence, Brent and the whole crew at DC fitness, thank you for showing me how to have the right posture and technique, and for showing me how strong I can be!<//review>

DC Fitness is amazing. I have been training here for a little over a year and the results I've seen are remarkable. Not only has my body physically changed but I feel a lot better about myself and have fun doing so. Dylan and his team are wonderful to work with and genuinely care about their clients' success... you get a program customized to your needs, nutrition coaching as well as great motivation along the way.

Highly recommend working out here. I look forward to it every time I go.< /text>

DC Fitness was the perfect gym for me. I responded to an ad for the 6 week challenge. Was able to drop my body fat from 18.2% - 12.1% during the challenge. Developed healthy eating and exercise habits, made friends and was encouraged by the awesome team of trainers that keep you accountable and enthusiastic about your gains.

I couldn't recommend then more. ALL GAS NO BRAKES!<//review>

<text>I recently moved back to the West Side and was looking for a trainer to gain muscle and improve my health.  I was referred to Dylan Conrad and in just 3 weeks I've already seen remarkable results.  I've gained 7 pounds of lean muscle and my energy throughout the day has increased as well.

Dylan isn't just a trainer.  He is a personal fitness coach who teaches everything from the correct mechanics of exercises to proper nutrition and supplements intake.  He is very personable and tailors the program to fit the client's needs.

I would HIGHLY recommend Dylan to anyone that's looking to improve their life through physical fitness.<//text><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I Signed up for the 6-week challenge at DC Fitness. The goal was to lose 20lbs in 6 weeks. You get challenging workouts with a trainer aimed at pushing your fitness level and change with your progress. A grocery list and meal plan catered to your weight and weight loss goal. I recently completed my challenge losing 28lbs and 3.5% body fat. Dylan and the staff are great. Everyone encourages each other, shares recipes and help each other out with questions. If you want to lose weight, build muscle and need a kick in the pants! I highly recommend DC fitness!<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Before I started the 6 week challenge, I was in such a rut. I decided to go for it, and I’m so glad I did! It pushed me out of my comfort zone and I was held accountable with help from the trainers! The sense of community in this studio made me feel welcomed and kept me disciplined and I love all the friends I made! And not only am I much more confident, I know that I have the discipline to do whatever I want moving forward!</Review><user_name>Keyla Vasconcellos< /user_name><Response>None< /Response>< Rate>

<Date>1526709596597<//Date><review>the 6 week challenge on facebook and decided to give it a try. I really wanted something to get me in shape quick for my upcoming trip to Europe in July. I met with Dylan and he explained the process very well and how everything worked. I decided to challenge myself and lose 5% body fat. I was given a meal plan and and will meet with a trainer 3 times a week.

The meal plan was very easy to follow and made me a little creative to come up with delicious meals and saved me some money too.

During the 6 weeks, I trained with Adam Damper. He is freaking awesome!! Great motivator, pushes you, and will crack some jokes along the way. Made the training session fun too.

In the end, I was able to lose 5.2% body and met my goal. I had a great experience with both Dylan and Adam. I feel and look great and gave some confidence too. If you're looking for a fast change, I recommend DC Fitness.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><rate>5</rate>< Resp>

I found DC Fitness through their 6 week challenge. I have had such a great experience with them! From the trainers, to the other people at the gym, I have always felt encouraged to push myself and do the best I can. I've never been to a gym where I felt like I wasn't in competition with those around me, and that's exactly how I feel at DC. Each time I walk in everyone is so warm and welcoming and has made this journey such a memorable one. Thanks to DC I have built new fitness and eating habits, thanks to a little kick in the butt, and have made a significant amount of progress that I would not have otherwise!<//review>

I completed a 6-week challenge and stuck around as an OG for a few weeks before moving out of the area. The whole team of trainers/coaches at DC Fitness is fantastic. They support you in and out of the gym to help you meet your health and fitness goals. The workouts are killer with great variety - you'll never be bored or looking at the clock!<//review>

<text>What a great of a experience, I came in out of shape getting how I looked in the mirror. My trainer Terrence was so kind, and always answering my questions. And making sure I was always on track to my goal each week. Lost over 8 percent in body fat and 22 pounds. Definitely feels like a second home when I go workout with everyone.  If your ready for a life change this is the place to do it!!!</text><userid>107167667735855990748< /userid>< name>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Best gym I’ve been to! I started training with Dylan when I realized I needed to push myself to reach my body goals. I had lost weight a few years before, but plateaued and never really trained to gain muscle.

I weighted in for the 6 week body transformation challenge at 168.8lbs and 23.4% body fat.  My goal was to lose 20 lbs. Dylans meal plan was easy to follow and left room to make healthy meals that were also delicious.

For my 6 weeks , I trained with Adam and Emma, who both made the process worthwhile. Their training pushed me in every session in the best way possible.  Their humor, the 80’s music, and the ambiance of the gym made working out fun. Even when I wasn’t in the mood to train, I always left my sessions in a better mood.

After my 6 weeks training , I now weigh in at 146 and am down to 16% body fat, meaning I lost 22.2 pounds and 7 percent body fat , which is kinda insane.  This place is the real deal! I’m so excited to go forward with all Dylan, Adam, and Emma have taught me.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

My experience mirrors all the other reviewers here. Dylan and the rest of the team at DC Fitness were so great to work with. The atmosphere they've established is very approachable and positive. The semi-private personal training set-up was perfect for me. Dylan helped me hit all my goals and then some. I would recommend DC Fitness to anyone. No matter what you're looking for from your workout, they'll be able to help you achieve it.< /review>

I love DC Fitness.  I feel that they are constantly trying to improve their clients with new routines every month and tracking your results.  The atmosphere is fun, and everyone feels like family.  I have trained with DC Fitness for more than four years.  They have taken me through many phases in my training, from losing weight, getting stronger, and even an intentional bulking phase.  They do a lot of functional fitness techniques which have done a lot to correct my many imbalances and make me feel like I have a solid base to pursue my other athletic endeavors.  I always used their semi private training which helped keep the costs down.  I still felt like I was getting all the attention I needed.  I highly recommend them to anyone looking for personal training in West LA.< /review>

This isn't the type of gym you come into feeling intimidated by others. Not only is the staff very supportive but the other clients are equally into being there for each other. In just 6 short weeks DC fitness helped me lose 5.9% body fat and 9 pounds through their training sessions and nutrition plan. They were the perfect outlet to help me kick start the healthy lifestyle I would like to continue on a daily basis. All the trainers were very attentive to my needs and goals and Dylan was always there to make sure we had any questions or concerns answered. You instantly feel like you belong and it makes the journey a lot more reachable and enjoyable. Highly recommend!</Review>

If you are ready to change, DC Fitness will get you the results you have been looking for. I lost 25 lbs and 6.4% body fat in just 6 weeks! To say I feel amazing is an understatement. Thanks to their incredible, knowledgeable trainers, my body is moving faster and easier than it has in years. Not only am I looking like the me I remember, I am feeling like her, too! Increased energy, confidence, and overall happiness, thanks to this program, facility, and it's amazing staff. I can never thank them enough for giving me this jump start, and look forward to continuing working to get the best body I've ever had!!<//Text>

<review>Like many of the reviews on here, I came to DC Fitness through their 6 week challenge. Lose 20 pounds in 6 weeks? It seemed pretty insane. I've gone to gyms and worked out on my own before and the results weren't even close to anything I could call a transformation. But over 6 weeks I dropped 24 pounds, almost 7% body fat and feel like a new person.

The trainers are fantastic and will push you to succeed and reach new heights. They are also patient and will help you if you have awful form like me. They can adapt workouts to your needs and work around any injuries you may have. Even though I was pushed hard I never dreaded going to the gym which was surprising to me and a testament to them.

It wasn't easy. I changed my diet and put in a lot of work, but ultimately I wouldn't have seen the results I did without DC Fitness<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc9ffe82fc25:0x22aea43e08991e6b<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>The first week of July, I had to shop for new jeans because none of mine fit me anymore. Then I saw an ad from DC Fitness. Could I lose 6% body fat in 6 weeks? I held off on donating my old jeans and took the DC Fitness 6-week Challenge. With their program of meal plans, accountability coaching, and strength training, I surpassed what I thought was possible. I lost 19 lbs and 6.9% body fat. From where I started, I didn't think I had that much weight to lose. Now I am in the best shape of my life and I owe it all to their excellent coaches Brent, Terrance, and Cornelius. Thank you Dylan and Ambra for this amazing program. I feel like I can conquer anything now.</Text>< Response>

I trained with Dylan back in 2013 for over 2 years and recently I visited the studio and trained with Larrell and Emma who were both really great to train with. The facility is clean and the gym equipment is kept in good condition. The workouts are versatile and during semi-private group training you typically wont have more than 2 or 3 people working out with you, which allows the trainer to divide his attention evenly among everyone. Dylan is extremely knowledgeable and knows his stuff when it comes to fitness. Definitely recommend this place!!<//text>< name>

GO TO THIS GYM. I cannot tell you how great these people are. Dylan, Adam and Emma coached me through an insane 6-week transformation that resulted in me losing 30 lbs and 11% body fat. They are attentive, caring and driven and inspire their clients to get the absolute most out of the workouts. This was one of the better decisions i have made in a long long time and i highly recommend you commit to it too.<//review>

<Review>I have been a client of Dylan Conrad Fitness for several years. I have utilized his services for several aspects of my fitness requirements, from specific sports conditioning, weight loss, and injury management and prevention.  Dylan has always adjusted my programs to meet my goals and keep it interesting. Programs are individually designed and changed every few weeks. Dylan also monitors his clients progress with periodic assessments including body composition analysis.
Dylan and his team are not pushy "drill sergeant " trainers. As a team they are firm and supportive without being pushy and loud. The studio is small but not cramped and his online scheduling is easy to maneuver. Dylan is committed and stays up to date on the latest in training and diet. I will continue to use him for any aspect of physical conditioning and highly recommend him and his company.<//Review></record>

They've taught me that fitness and nutrition is really a lifestyle, and I can't wait to keep it up. Who could ask for more?</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

DC Fitness is amazing! I'm not the type to be diligent about working out, but DC Fitness finally got me there. Dylan, Emma, and Larrell are each excellent trainers that offer different points of view and a great time no matter what. My favorite thing about DC Fitness is that they've successfully created an environment in which people of all different fitness levels can exercise together in the same space without feeling a sense of competition. It's a wonderful little community that I'm happy to be a part of and I'm so grateful that they've made me a healthier, stronger person.</Review>

<Review>I met Dylan when he came to my work place to demonstrate work place exercises. Since they resonated with what was ailing me I signed up for the DC Fitness jump start program. I liked the intimacy of the studio, as big gyms have always been a turn off, and I loved the customized program. Before starting there was a body assessment and goals discussed. Given my schedule, I worked out with all three of the primary trainers and all were great. I was extremely happy at my one month assessment. Results were more than I expected. - fat percentage down 7%. I look forward to moving beyond the jump start program and seeing further results.< /Review><rating>5< /rating><gmapID>0x80c2bc9ffe82fc25:0x22aea43e08991e6b< /gmapID><name>Savoy Hallinan<//name><resp>None</resp>< user>

Couldn't recommend more highly. Completed the 6 week challenge and lost over 25lbs and 10% body fat! They gave all the best tools and encouragement, and importantly made it really fun throughout. I'm excited to continue with the weight I've lost and the friends I've gained!<//Review>

I had been trying to tone up and lose a few pounds for over a couple of years and I just didn't think that it was possible because I am on the petite side - 5'3" with a starting weight of 126.6 lbs.  The 6 week challenge kicked my butt and got me to my goal, i lost 7% body fat and 10 lbs!

The gym has a community feel to it and the trainers are all really kind, professional and motivational.   The workouts are great and I found myself getting stronger each week, trying heavier weights and feeling proud.

The diet is very doable, and they give you recipes that actually taste great.  With the help of that + Pinterest, eating became a breeze.

I definitely recommend this challenge and gym to people who are looking to reach a goal and are willing to put in the work.  Thank you DC Fitness!<//review>< pics>

I've been training with DC Fitness now for about 3 months.  After moving to Santa Monica, I tried a few different training/exercise programs and I have to say I love what I've found at DC fitness - a customized training program with trainers who care about your individual progress and push you at every step to maximize effectiveness of an exercise while prioritizing proper form above all else.  I also like that there are new individualized programs every month based on my goals.

Dylan, Larrell and Emma are awesome!  I love the vibe they create at DC Fitness - just a great down to earth comfortable environment every time I'm in there.

Training at DC fitness 3 days a week for the past three months, I've seen great improvement in my strength, stamina and endurance.  I have more energy during my day and less aches and pains in my body. I look forward to seeing where my training will take me!

I highly recommend DC Fitness for anyone looking to make a real change in their body.<//review>

The gym has a nice environment, it is clean, full of workout equipment and full of people who are super friendly and going towards similar goals as you. DC Fitness staff will always be motivating you to achieve your goal, complimenting your achievements, and helping you with any doubt you might have about meal plans and outside workout.
I started the 6-week challenge on April 19th. My weight was 127.4 lb and my body fat was at 32%. I was a little skeptical about the program and the fact that I had to lose 5% body fat in 6 weeks. Nevertheless, I committed and found myself at 117 lb and losing 6% body fat at the end of the challenge!<//Text>< Pictures>

Dylan and his team offer a fantastic fitness option that really stands out in the super-saturated LA market. Everyone is extremely welcoming and knowledgeable, and you will always feel like you are getting their utmost personalized attention, right from the initial, full-body assessment that allows them to identify your areas of strength, weakness, and injury to create the perfect program for you. Whatever your fitness goals are, DC Fitness will absolutely help you reach them.</text>

Lucky to have happened upon DC Fitness on Instagram. After my consultation with Dylan & Ambra, I knew I was in great hands. The 6 Week Fitness challenge served as a reboot in how I approach my Fitness journey, which began back in Summer 2012.

Dylan and his team of consistent exceptional trainers, all of whom always offer specific, tailored modifications and form-corrections to all students in class, helped me achieve and surpass my goals - goals I was genuinely convinced were unattainable in 6 weeks. Nutrition-wise, Dylan offered me a meal plan that was a complete game-changer. I have always eaten healthy but Dylan offered specific modifications to help ensure I’d be able to achieve my goals.

After plateauing for about a year, after working with the DC team for just 6 weeks, I ended up winning my Fitness Challenge and lost 6 lbs of fat. It’s been about 2.5 weeks since I completed the challenge and not only have I been maintaining how lean I became, my body is still metabolizing and further burning—just in time for summer too!

Thanks all for an incredible time!< /review>

<Review>Like many people, I have an extremely demanding and time-consuming job that eats up most of my day.  So I struggled with finding (and making) the time or effort to work out. Turns out my mental, physical and emotional health suffered as a result. And then I started training at DC Fitness… and everything changed.   From the very first time I spoke to Dylan Conrad and every workout since then, I have felt supported and encouraged by Dylan and his trainers.  Every workout is personally programmed with my goals in mind and the energy and vibes I feel when I walk into DC Fitness are only positive, fun and uplifting.  One of the best hours of my day is spent at DC Fitness sweating my butt off, accomplishing and surpassing my personal goals and laughing and having a good time along the way.  DC Fitness’ semi-personal training is the perfect combination of getting the benefits of my own workout program while also getting to work out alongside people who share the same goals of making healthier choices in the pursuit of becoming a better, happier version of ourselves. If you’re like me 5 months ago and you desperately need to take that first big step towards making an effective lifestyle change, training at DC Fitness is the best decision you have yet to make.</Review></record>

I want to express my gratitude to the wonderful trainers and Ambra for my transformative experience. I had could have used a number of excuses for not achieving my goals yet thanks to the trainers at DC Fitness I achieved incredible results. Devastated by a divorce I did not want, motorcycle accident, challenges of raising 2 small children, etc. I still lost over 25 pounds and continue to eat and exercise as prescribed. If I can do it, so can you!!!!</Review>

You can tell a lot by a gym by its cleanliness. The place is ALWAYS spotless. The trainers are very knowledgeable and not "boot-campy" where they just stand over you and yell. The exercise programs the staff creates do this for the trainers. I get measured every 4 weeks with my body fat and have continued to see results. I recommend D.C. Fitness for anyone tired of doing a personal training program but not tracking whether or not they are seeing progress. 5 stars!</Review>

The staff at DC is beyond welcoming. The attention provided following up on my diet, workouts, etc is beyond any other training facility I've been to. After my first month training at DC fitness I already dropped 7 pounds while gaining strength. The pricing is great as well, looking forward to continued results</Text>

I found DC Fitness through an ad on Facebook, and thought I'd give it a try. It ended up being exactly what I needed, with an incredible group of trainers (shoutout to Terrence, Ezekiel, and Melvin) and a truly intimate and familial environment with amazing, challenging workouts. Through the workout program and diet plan I dropped more than half my body fat (14.4% to 7.1%) in six weeks, looking and feeling better than I ever have. I am so thankful to Dylan and the whole clan for setting me on a path of fitness and health that I hope to continue on for the rest of my life.<//Text>

<review>I’ve been going to DC Fitness for the past four months and have been extremely pleased.  The semi-private training sessions (max 3 people at a time) allow me to have enough personal attention, without breaking the bank.  The training regimens are personalized for each person, however, to match with your stated fitness goals.  Most of all, the trainers (Larrell and Emma) are both great – they’re the right balance of easy-going and positive, one the one hand, yet willing to push you enough to get results.<//review>< pics>

I just finished an intense 6-week challenge at DC Fitness and I couldn't be happier with my results. In just 6 weeks, I lost 12.8 pounds and 8.4% body fat!!!! With the right meal plan, semi-private strength training sessions, extra cardio training on my own, a lot of focus and dedication, I'm back to where I want to be in my physical self. Not only that, this program gave me a renewed spirit and reminded me that I can do anything I set my mind to. Thank you DC Fitness for helping me achieve my goals. It was a great challenge, a great experience, and I learned so much. Healthy eating and being active is a part of being happy to me. This challenge is not over! It's a lifelong challenge that I'm ready to face one day at a time.< /Review>

I signed up for semi-private training DC Fitness after reading so many positive Yelp reviews. Dylan, Larrell and Sara are fantastic. In our first meeting, Dylan took considerable time to talk with me about my goals, questions and any obstacles that I had already noticed in my fitness. He then made a custom program for me and took several baseline measurements so that we could track my progress. 4 weeks in and I am already seeing measurable results. I am also finding that I am more motivated to work out because I no longer have to wonder if I'm doing what I need to do to meet my fitness goals. I've put all of that into Dylan's very capable hands.</Review>

I’ve been training with Dylan's team since moving back to LA last spring. It is far and away the best personal training experience I've ever had - Dylan cultivates an environment that is driven yet supportive and fun and completely positive. I've lost weight, grown stronger, and learned how to do interesting and challenging exercises. Also, the small group session approach provides the right level of attention at a great value.</review>

DC Fitness is the absolute best! Dylan and his team totally know what's up when it comes to the workout world! Instead of feeling intimidated by the gym, they make the experience super comfortable, personalized and fun. Not to mention, it's a really tough workout.

I can’t say enough great things about Dylan and the trainers at DC Fitness, it’s an awesome atmosphere and everyone there (trainers and trainees alike) are great to be around and very motivating.  Off the bat it’s clear that their goal is to help you become the best you, not get you in and out or set unrealistic goals.  Everyone is very personable, which – for someone that doesn’t particularly like working out – makes it a much more enjoyable experience.

My goals initially started at just getting healthy.  It had been a couple years of no exercise and terrible eating habits, so really just wanted to go slow and steady.  In about two months I started seeing noticeable results and lost over 10lbs, but most importantly I had way more energy and wasn’t feeling sluggish anymore.  About two months after that my clothes started fitting completely different, and exercise wasn’t feeling like a chore, but rather something I enjoyed.

I really recommend checking out DC Fitness, Dylan and everyone are knowledgeable, personable and understand everyone’s needs and goals are different, and that a “one size fits all” program doesn’t work.< /review>

I cannot say enough good things about them! Not only do they understand fitness, but they understand function so are totally safe while training, but your workouts will help you in your daily life. They have helped a number of my patients get out of pain faster and stay better longer!

Keep up the good work!< /Text><response>None</response>< date>

The fitness environment at DC Fitness is great. The semi-private classes are small, everyone is friendly, and they give me the direct attention I need. I fall into the category of people who thought they were getting a good workout in while doing it on my own. That all changed when I was given a fitness plan and motivation by the DC trainers while in their facility. The intensity of my workouts elevated and I learned that I can perform activities well beyond the limits that I had set. You will monitor your progress by getting periodic check-ins to review your levels, those kept me motivated to eat healthy during the weeks as well as continue my fitness plan. Overall 5 stars and worth taking the plunge at any stage you may be in life.< /text>

When I first joined DC Fitness, I was totally intimidated. I've never worked out as hard as I have in the classes, but the instructors Brent, Cornelius and Terrence were so supportive, enthusiastic, and motivating, I kept going and completed the challenge! I've always struggled with my weight, so when I starting losing body fat, and not as much weight, Ambra calculated and explained how much fat I was actually losing, and muscle I was gaining, and I was much more forgiving of myself. I had been running around town in workout wear for 6 weeks, taking other cardio classes aside from the 3 each week at DC. When I finally wore normal clothes, I was totally able to see the difference - clothes that were normally tight on me were loose and comfortable! DC Fitness has not only taught me about eating properly, I learned that incorporating exercise into my daily routine was not something I dread, but actually enjoy. Thank you DC Fitness for helping me with this life change!</text>

I’ve been training at DC Fitness for just over 2 years now. When I first spoke to Dylan on the phone, I remember asking him what he does for continuing education, his vision for the business, and some other off the wall questions. He answered them swiftly, and I knew DC Fitness was the right place for me to be at. The attention they take to progressing their knowledge on training is amazing, and the vision to make fitness so simple anyone can get results, has rang true for me. I have some shoulder range of motion limitations, an insane work schedule, and the custom workout programs I get at DC Fitness are not only easy to follow (albeit super hard) they are also fun. I Love the atmosphere and other clients in this gym. If you have injuries or are just looking to be apart of an amazing gym, DC Fitness is a must for you.</Review>

Dylan is awesome! I can't begin to tell you how many times I've worked with trainers who were all talk.  Dylan is smart, articulate, and really knows his stuff. There's a waiting list for a reason, and the results speak for themselves WOW!

I've never done any personal training (nor have I been active or athletic in my whole life) before and therefore feel very fortunate to have found DC Fitness. I had my first evaluation and training session with Dylan. The evaluation was very comprehensive and I believe essential for anyone who is looking for long-term lifestyle change and subsequent maintenance (not just to lose weight or get fit within a certain time frame and then rebound afterward). It is also important because you get to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your body and train more effectively and scientifically. I then had more sessions with Sara, who's just been an awesome lady to work with. All the trainers and staff on the team are super friendly and encouraging - They're attentive to your needs and progress. The gym itself is an intimate setting, and I've enjoyed my encounters with other clients (It's not competitive or self-serving like some other gyms in LA). Overall an uplifting culture. I always feel my sessions pass by in no time, while still being adequately challenged! Thank you Dylan and Sara. And thank you Jaslyn for always being so on top of the scheduling!</text>

<text>Joining DC fitness was one of the greatest decisions I have ever made for myself. I have struggled for years with finding the right gym and the right workout program and DC fitness has been the answer. You couldn't ask for a better team, a better program, or a better price for a personal training experience. Dylan and his staff are some of the most helpful and compassionate people I have ever encountered in a gym setting. Not only do I get a person to positively motivate me while I workout, I also get a completely personalized workout program redesigned for ME every 4 weeks. It's pretty incredible. Dylan and his staff also help with diet, routine, scheduling etc. Booking a session couldn't be easier as well, it is right through the MINDBODY app. I give DC fitness a 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend to anyone, regardless of age, experience, or schedule.<//text>< pics>

<review>I live to fish, it's more than just a hobby, it's my passion.
But for the past 5 years, my passion has been nothing more than a distant memory due to severe back pains. I had been afraid of any type strenuous lifting - from giant fish to my groceries; so lifting weights was out of the question in my mind. After beating myself up about this, I decided I needed to do something about it so I looked around and a close friend recommended that DC fitness was perfect for getting me back in shape while minding my injury. BEST DECISION EVER. I now feel 10x better than I did before and my back is stronger than ever (along with my core and legs that I've never really paid attention to). Although the workouts are tough, the atmosphere is is energetic and Dylan keeps the environment fun, friendly and stress free.
If you're someone who has an injury and it's preventing you from getting healthy, I would suggest giving DC fitness a look.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2bc9ffe82fc25:0x22aea43e08991e6b< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I've worked in many gyms through out my life. Many of the large commercial gyms I felt like I wasn't making a difference for people. I have been working here at DC Fitness for about 8 months. Immediately through our programing system I knew I was in the right place. Here we make customized programs specifically to each clients needs. We create a complete physical baseline for clients through testing for body fat, muscular strength, endurance, and imbalance testing. We then use linearization programing to show them how we are going to help reach there fitness goals. Reassessments are done every month to track their progress and make adjustments to their programs if necessary. We offer complimentary fitness assessments to anyone interested in joining. Please don't hesitate to contact us. Don't wait when it comes to your health.<//Review>

My son Dylan had a dream to open up his own gym.  I'm his mom and am VERY proud of him.  I too have always been into fitness, always going to the gym.  I even got into road biking and did a major 395 mile ride from San Francisco to Santa Barbara. It was the best and worst experience of my life.  Best because it fulfilled my own dream, and worst because during the ride I fell and injured my knee. I've had pain and swelling in that knee ever since and my doctor said I needed a knee replacement.                                                 My son kept telling me to come to his gym because I could no longer exercise. Finally I succumbed.  It's taken a while for my knee to get strong but I'm at a point where it hasn't swollen and I don't wear my knee brace.  I've been going twice a week and am so happy I followed happy I followed my sons advice. I train with Sara and Larrell and they are phenomenal. My knee feels almost back to where it was before the injury and I am so happy I won't need surgery. I recommend D.C. Fitness to anyone who has injuries and is looking to train around them and also wants to strengthen the muscles around to alleviate the pain.<//text>

<Text>I accepted a 6-week challenge at DC Fitness, and at first I was skeptical, because their workouts were only 60 mins, 3 times a week and a meal plan that seemed unrealistic. So how was was I going to accomplish my goals  with a plan I didn’t believe was realistic? How could they guarantee me the results I was aiming for! Fast forward 6 weeks, the intense workouts were beyond what I expected and pushed me to my limits. I chose to lose 5% body fat and at the end of the program I lost roughly 7%.  Not only did I exceed my goal, but now I am back to where I wanted physically.  Thanks to Dylan and the trainers for pushing me, providing me with a customized nutrition plan and modified workouts during my times of injury. DC Fitness is definitely a place you want to check out if you want to yield results. As long as you adhere to their plan, you will be happy!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

DC Fitness is more than a workout program, it is a family. When you walk in, you are always greeted not only by the staff but by the other members who you get to know as well. Everyone has a huge smile and is always happy to see each other and catch up.

I have only been training with Dylan and his team for a month, and I really feel a difference already. Dylan and his team really care about your overall health throughout the entire week, and give you tips on what you should be doing on days when you aren't coming in. Dylan also checks in to make sure you are sleeping and eating well.

I have gone to other gyms and felt like I just blended in with everyone else doing their own thing, but at DC Fitness you become part of a family and a team where everyone is working together and supporting one another in their health goals. I strongly recommend you contact them ASAP to check it out!<//review>

<Review>The thing that has made me the happiest about training with DC Fitness has to be that it has brought about a sea change for me in terms of my overall commitment to taking care of myself. Working out in the gym is one thing, but building a life that supports those efforts and promotes healthier choices...that's really what it's all about.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Name>

<Review>I took on the 6 week challenge and was honestly TERRIFIED I wouldn’t meet the goal. I had never had any health and fitness routine, never exercised consistently and didn’t make any real effort to eat well, so when I walked out of the gym after making the commitment to lose 6% body fat in 6 weeks, I was already making peace with my failure. 6 weeks and 2 days later, I’m really freakin’ proud of myself and so grateful for the life changing experience I had with DC Fitness. I lost 6.5% body fat and 12lbs, which is cool and all, but the real transformation for me was the joy I felt in going to the gym, and the future of strength and wellness that’s possible for me as a result of the confidence and knowledge I gained from the DC fam. The people are great, the work outs are challenging and personal, and the meal plan is... hard... but worth it! Lol. If you’re considering it, DO IT 👏</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I am a former athlete and used to work out all the time, but over the recent years had fallen off because of work and a lack of motivation. Dylan and DC Fitness completely changed that. They revitalized my workout routine and I almost immediately saw MAJOR results. In just 5 short months, I lost 10 pounds, 1.5 inches off my waist, went down almost 2.5% in body fat, and saw cuts all over my body that hadn't seen in years. The most exciting part of all of this, however, was my renewed sense of motivation and desire to exercise again. They made me realize how much I missed it!

They are friendly, knowledgable, will help you with any nagging injury you may have, and create a fun and relaxed environment to work out in, all the while keeping the intensity high and the sweat pouring off your body.

I would recommend DC Fitness to people of all fitness levels and dedication!< /text>

Found DC Fitness when I was searching for personal trainers on Yelp. They had really good reviews and a great introductory offer/program, so I trained with Dylan and Larrell for a month (semi-private, 3x/week). I lost 2% body fat and was really happy with my results. I didn't sign up for their long-term programs immediately, and instead took some time off and just started again after several months. I came back having re-gained the weight I previously lost, plus some extra. I did an assessment after 3 weeks of working out at DC Fitness again and lost almost 3% body fat. Very much looking forward to the rest of my results. Dylan, Larrell and Emma are great trainers who are always open to feedback. Every person has their own custom program and body composition is checked every month to track progress and figure out the best way to move forward. Love it here and I definitely recommend this place for folks who are having a tough time toning up on their own.<//review>

Dylan is very thorough with his program. He gave me exact instructions about my diet and at home workouts. I am very sure if everyone sticks to his plan, they will definitely achieve the results they expect.
Emma and Larrel are the other trainers and they're super helpful and know what they're doing. I would definitely recommend DC fitness to  anyone wanting to get in shape in the most efficient way posssible.< /review>

I just finished my 6 week challenge at DC Fitness and I am so excited about the results. I dropped 19 lbs and 5.3% bodyfat in 6 weeks. All of the trainers are great, and the atmosphere is one to definitely promote great results. You become a part of a community of liked-minded, supportive people that will push you to get the results you are looking for. Thanks Dylan, Adam, Larrell, and Emma!</review>

<Text>Absolutely phenomenal. I'm a very unmotivated individual when it comes to working out or exercising. The staff at DC Fitness made it not feel like such a chore. I quickly transitioned from hating the gym and exercising to looking forward to my next session. They personalized a workout program that worked for me and allowed me to begin seeing results within a very short amount of time. All the while being friendly and taking a legitimate interest in me, beyond just that of a customer. Highly recommend!!< /Text>< gmapID>

This place was a life saver. I have been struggling with lower back pain for year now. A herniated disk kept me in constant pain and away from the gym. Dylan created a corrective based program that has help me strengthen my core and lower back. I am able to move and do activities I would stay away from for years. He is highly knowledgeable and answers any questions I may have. I would recommend him to all.< /review>

I have been working with Dylan and Larrell at DC Fitness for about 5 months now, and I continue to feel stronger and stronger with every session. I love the customized approach to programming in a small group fitness setting because I get the 1:1 coaching I need with the added support of other trainees working just as hard to achieve their goals. Dylan and Larrell understand and appreciate who I am, and design workouts to support my individual goals. If you are looking for workout variety or motivation and encouragement, I would highly recommend giving Dylan a call!</review>

<response>None< /response><user_id>112004377115669914834< /user_id><Text>what a journey it was when I first started coming here! I learned about this place from a Snapchat ad I saw.  Basically, it was promoting a six week challenge for a gym located in Brentwood.  I was called and told that the goal is to lose either 25 lbs or 6% BF within 6 weeks.  The catch is that you must pay a fee, but it will be reimbursed if you meet either goal.  It may seem tough, but if you stick through their workouts and meal plans, then you should come out ahead.

None of this is easy, don't get me mistaken.  It will be tough at first getting used to a drastically different meal plan, as well as being worked out rigorously, more than you're probably used to.  As time goes on, it'll get easier, but you should still push yourself in workouts and don't fall into temptations in your diet.

Workouts were tough, but they were also great.  While they were hard, you generally feel good afterwards, as if you have a boost in energy, despite being sore.  I feel this also helped me on my hike to Half Dome, which happened around the Week 4 mark for me.  It made it easier.  Big shoutouts to Sequoia, TJ, Cornelius, Ezekiel, Brent, Dylan, and Ambra for all helping me in their own ways.  They are all awesome people (:

Finally, I finished with this challenge at 6.8% BF loss and I believe roughly 21 lbs lost (From 22.1% -> 15.3% and 172.1 lbs -> 151.?).  If you have a true desire to be healthy and more fit than what you are now, then I think you can do well in this challenge.  As long as you are motivated, then it does not matter if you are overweight, old, young, weak, etc.  I've seen people of all types and backgrounds put in the work and get results myself. You can do it.

Once again, big thanks to DC Fitness fam!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

DC Fitness is hands down the best training/fitness program I have ever been a part of. I've tried many diets, workout routines, personal trainers etc and each time I've obtained some degree of success, only to find myself falling out of the routine and returning to bad habits. DC Fitness works with you on  a journey to achieve your goals by helping you establish attainable habits in a holistic way (e.g. changes to your diet, work out programs, stretching and injury prevention etc). The trainers (Sarah, Larell & Dylan) are superb and the entire staff is incredibly helpful and a pleasure to work with.< /text>

<Review>I never thought I would work with a trainer in my life. My friend. Thought me into DC Fitness, and having been in and out of classes and other pop up exercises, I had never been a part of something consistent and structured. I did be 3 week jump start and am so glad I did. Dylan and his team are so passionate about what they do, from
The level of commitment they have to each individuals programs, to the weekly and monthly accountability meetings, these guys have it down. Working with a trainer always just seemed boring and not fun until I came here. I recommend DC Fitness to anyone that wants to be part of a fun, progressive, and always interesting group of people.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

To put it bluntly Dylan and his staff KICKED MY BUT!!!!  But in the best way possible.  Halfway through the session, I remember thinking "I don't think I have ever had my arms feel like this so quick!"  And I played water polo in college and had weight training coaches with whom I could never get the results I wanted in my biceps and forearms.  More importantly, the staff at CF fitness takes pre-existing injuries very seriously.  They understand that before you start building your dream body, you have to fix the one you have first.  Because if you injure yourself even worse, you aren't going to get anywhere.  Young or old they understand what you need and if you stay committed you will achieve it at DC Fitness.<//Review>

I first found DC Fitness on Facebook and when I inquired about the 6 week free challenge I was immediately contacted by Dylan and made an appointment to come in to see for myself.
I was totally impressed and after speaking with Dylan for about 20 or 30 minutes I signed up for the challenge which I would start a few weeks later. I was completely supported throughout the six-week challenge with a meal plan accountability check-ins a Facebook group and a community of other clients and amazing trainers not to mention Dylan himself.
I would highly recommend DC Fitness and any program including the six-week challenge because they absolutely deliver results. I lost 20 lb in 6 weeks and it really couldn't have been easier, not that I didn't work hard not that the trainings aren't hard but if you're motivated you can make it happen. A million thanks to Dillon, Emma, Adam and Larrell.< /review>

As a mom of four and grandma of 3, it's been a very long time since I have been happy with my weight and fitness level. Since my youngest child is now away at college, I finally have time to focus on myself.  When I saw the DC Fitness 6 Week Challenge Video on Facebook, I was intrigued, but didn't think I could possibly lose 20 pounds in 6 weeks, let alone 6 months.  Nevertheless, with Dylan's encouragement, I reluctantly decided to give it a shot.  I must say, it was truly life changing, not only for me, but also for my husband who didn't even do the challenge.  I had to completely change my eating habits and was constantly sore from the training sessions and my additional daily workouts, but the results were definitely worth the struggle.  To my surprise, I was at the top of the leader board for our group for weight loss by week 4.  Not only did I make my goal of losing 20 pounds, but  I did it by week 5.  I completed the six week challenge and lost 24.6 pounds and 3% body fat and went down 2 sizes in jeans.  My results exceeded my expectations.   My husband also lost 20 pounds because he joined me in our drastic meal changes.  While the challenge is indeed difficult, it is also very attainable and once you are in the midst of it, it becomes very east to stay on track.  DC fitness provides 3 semi-private training sessions a week that are personally geared for your fitness level and goals.  They are  offered from early morning through the evening with great trainers: Larrell, Adam and Emma.  The flexibility of choosing the training time and trainer circumvents skipping training because of a difficult schedule.  DC fitness provides an initial weight and body fat assessment, personal meal and fitness plan.  They also provide resources like a shopping list, meal prep ideas, a cookbook, menu suggestions for eating out, extra workout videos, and a private facebook page for participants to share ideas, questions, encouragement and accountability pics to help keep everyone on track.  The simplicity of the menu allowed me to take 3 out of town trips during the 6 week challenge and still maintain 100% compliance.  When you put in your complete effort in, you will get results.< /Text>

When I came across DC Fitness I didn't know what to expect. I reached out to them about their 6 week challenge and I got a response fast. They got me onboard and made me feel welcomed from the beginning.

They offered me a meal plan, 3 training sessions a week, and a support group on Facebook with all the other people doing the challenge as well. Dylan, the one who runs the program, even posted recipes and workout videos on the group chat.

All the trainers were very helpful and pushed me to help me meet my goals. The vibes inside the studio were always great. In the 6 weeks, I lost 16lbs equaling to 7.3% body fat. Now I can wear crop tops!!

I couldn't be happier with the results. If anyone is serious about transforming their life and changing their eating habits, I really recommend DC Fitness. They will definitely help you get onboard with your transformation!< /Review>

As a local registered dietitian sharing a mission with DC Fitness of enhancing individual health through evidence-based, effective practice, I cannot recommend Dylan Conrad and the staff & services of DC Fitness enough. Between Dylan's kinesiologist credential (among many others) and the practices that DC Fitness employs to specifically measure a participant's progress, I can confidently refer my patients to DC Fitness knowing that they will be trained in a manner that considers any existing injuries, health concerns, or personal obstacles to exercise.

When I experienced a DC Fitness training session myself, the staff was welcoming, introducing me to each person in the room to encourage a familial atmosphere that immediately made me feel comfortable and safe. I was taken through a thorough assessment that allowed them to identify any compromised areas within my movement and to help me establish specific fitness goals.  I was then guided through a customized workout by Dylan and Larrell. It was apparent that both trainers had an extensive knowledge of exercise physiology, helping me to maintain good form while challenging my fitness abilities. I left feeling confident, motivated, and clear on what my fitness goals were moving forward. And it's impossible to dread working out with Dylan and his staff because they make the whole process fun! My favorite part of their programs is that they are designed in a way that is accessible and practical for most.

I have no hesitations in recommending DC Fitness to my patients and family/friends because I know anyone I send to Dylan and his staff will receive excellent care all around, which is rare. Definitely check them out!< /review>

< Review>
I had been working out at a commercial gym for several months hoping to gain some muscle mass. It wasn’t too long before I realized that I’m not seeing results other than a shoulder injury. So, I decided to look for a local personal trainer and it wasn’t an easy task AT ALL! After a week of rigorous search, I found DC fitness and decided to give it a shot. Joining DC fitness was one of the best desicions I’ve made in a long time.

I’ve been working out with Dylan (private sessions) and his team - Larrell and Emma (semi-private sessions) for the last 2 months and I am seeing amazing results so far. I have higher energy levels, my balance and flexibility have improved significantly and I’m gaining muscle mass. I’ve come to realize that what I’ve been missing while working out on my own, was a tailored workout and nutrition plan designed by a knowledgable and caring trainer to follow and reach my goals without injuring myself.

Dylan and his team are passionate about fitness and it shows through the energy and enthusiasm they bring to every session. Dylan makes each workout session challenging, creative and most importantly he motivates you to push past your perceived limits to get results. He switches up the program regularly to keep your body from adapting to the routines. He also makes sure that your form is spot on with each exercise.
I have also referred my girlfriend to Dylan, and she has witnessed similar results and happy with her decision to join DC fitness.

If you’re in the market for a trainer, and you are serious about changing your lifestyle and reaching your goals, Dylan and his team at DC fitness will lead you every step of the way. To be honest, you’d be foolish to pass on at least giving DC fitness a try. Just don’t take my time slots!</Review>

Dylan came to my Cowering space and did a lunch & learn. He kept me and all the attendees engaged. The information he provided was all applicable to our daily lives. He touched on posture, breathing, and functional training. Being a busy professional and sitting for long hours I used the information provided and fell the pain in my neck reducing. Im excited to say Im going to be going in for a complimentary session in the near future. I would recommend this guy.<//review>

Dylan and Larrell are great trainers and have lots of knowledge. They emphasize technique and form before anything. They create clear cut training programs.Through linearization they graph out a roadmap month by month on how they are going to reach fitness goals of their clients.  I respect how much communication they have between themselves and their clients. Every month right before a client is done with a training phase, they sit down with them and explain why exercises they will be doing next month and the reasoning behind picking the exercise. They want the clients to gain knowledge along with their training. Beyond the training aspect, the environment is great. Everyone comes together for a common cause, which is to be healthy.<//Text>

Great gym and a great trainer! Super private studio in Brentwood. Dylan was so relatable and knowledgable about the fitness industry. Definitely recommend checking it out!!!<//review>

<Name>Jill Hartley</Name><review>DC Fitness is THE BEST! If you're looking for personal training in a group setting, where the owner and trainers all have expert knowledge, provide quality care and personal attention, DC Fitness is THE BEST! I joined their program and have been a huge fan now for six months. They've helped me tremendously.

I have a bad knee with no cartilage. My sports orthopedic doctor recommended surgery which I'm trying to avoid at all costs. My chiropractor (Dr. Ben Kleinbrodt, Brentwood Spine & Sport) referred me to Dylan at DC Fitness where he suggested I work with Dylan and his trainers on my hips in addition to my knee.

The results! After six months, I have virtually no knee pain. I've lost 20+ pounds and have dropped my body fat to a "normal" level. More importantly, I feel like I'm in great shape for my age--I have stopped taking Aleve daily and have amp'd up my workout to begin lunges again.

I purposely alternate between Dylan's two lead trainers: Emma and Larrell. Both provide consistent training, but share different insights and motivation techniques to keep me on track. One of the perks of DC Fitness is its family atmosphere. There are no prima donnas -- only committed customers!!!</review><GmapID>0x80c2bc9ffe82fc25:0x22aea43e08991e6b<//GmapID>< rating>

< Review>
I’ve been training with DC fitness for quite a while. It's amazing how the team trains with minimal equipment. It shows that fancy stuff isn't necessary.  Basics with free weights, cable machine, kettle bells, barbells, and your own body weight. The trainers really customize your programs and I notice a difference in my overall movement/strength and its applicability with everyday things (like carrying heavy cases of water). I really enjoy seeing my progress and gains in strength, mobility, and flexibility. The trainers are able to push me and they somehow know I'm stronger than I think I am.  I guess I actually can deadlift 200# (at least one rep). Haha. And somehow they convinced me to do burpees. I hate burpees.<//Review>

<Review>Gyms and personal trainers have never appealed to me as I have always got my training from surfing and jiu jitsu but I am now in a traveling work situation that doesn't allow me to do either one very often.  I knew it was time to meet with a trainer to get me on a workout program while I am living in hotels and on the road. My close friend recommended Dylan, saying he cant believe how strong and fit he has become since he has been working with him and how his core strength has also helped his surfing.

I decided to give Dylan a shot and I can say it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. He is so thorough and clear on what exercises work on certain body types and he immediately got me on a great workout routine that I can do at home, in the gym or more importantly take on the road with me. I can honestly say if I stop traveling for work and could start consistently surfing and training jiu jitsu again, I would definitely continue training with Dylan as I have never felt better and can see the results that I was after.< /Review>< pics>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I'd highly recommend Dylan and DC Fitness!  I've worked with Dylan twice since 2011, each time for a few months, and in both cases I achieved significant results.  When Dylan and I first connected in 2011 I had just started back to the gym after taking well over a year off, and having had recurring back issues for a few years was subsequently pretty sedentary and not in great shape at the time.  I had never worked with a personal trainer before, and I learned a lot from the program and exercises.  And, had gained back a lot of strength I had lost previously. I'd like to think Dylan played an instrumental part in getting me back on track and really motivated about my fitness again!

From 2012-2015 I ventured off on my own again and had reached a new plateau of fitness - gaining a lot of strength in the process (being even much stronger than I was in my 20s; almost 20 years earlier!).  But, I definitely had some imbalances (upper body strength and bench was great, but was lacking a bit in lower body - deadlift and squats specifically).  This program helped considerably and I was actually able to reach a deadlift personal record that I had been trying to break though own my own without success.  And, this strength program played a huge part in doing a grueling 12 mile Tough Mudder obstacle course race at the end of my training.

Dylan and team are:

* Very professional, helpful and patient when it comes to providing feedback, correcting form and guidance

* Super knowledge on program creation - knowing which exercises, sets, reps, and different phases to work through for achieving results

* Helpful on providing guidance on nutrition and diet

* Knowledgable on working around injuries and coming up with a gameplan to correct. I had never done much mobility work before, or worked specifically on addressing weakness and found this work to be instrumental<//Text>< Pictures>

Hey everyone this place is ok. I don’t recommend unless it’s necessary. Staff here are really rude and don’t care. Best option is just go with flow just so you get yours needs anything else I do respect like the manager, some security and specific staff. Anything else eww.< /text>

<Review>Just went to donate food for the needy.
Opened the door to their office and was immediately greeted with hostility. In a not very friendly tone they asked me to step out and what was my business there. I’m here to donate food.
They continued their sh!tty attitude.
Last time I’ll try to help out this shelter with ANYTHING. They’re not appreciating anything anyone does for them.

Truly angelic. This organization probably does the most to help the homeless. They offer laundry, showers and locker storage for the day. It’s hard to get a job when you look and smell homeless. These guys help eliminate to obstacles to success.</Text>

Everyday those who are without what most of us take for granted can get here  and sadly there are maybe one or two other places offering some of the same services. Everyday they hand out a sack lunch and 2 days a week they serve a hot meal. The venice family clinic comes in to provide minimal medical care. I haven't seen more then one or two get housing and those were extreme cases. Most of the staff there are very patient and really do care and as I've seen really wish there was more they were able to do but getting help to those who need it and in a timely manner is very hard to do here in Los Angeles county.<//review>

I love this place. Really nice staff. A lot of the time its just nothing but smiles and happiness. The volunteers that come out and donate are a true blessing. Their services are really good for the homeless. The up keep of the place is top notch, in my opinion. Even if the homeless get rowdy and rough they are always helpful and are willing to help out a stagnant issue. They are very respectful! God is doing a wonderful job there and they tend to go far and beyond to help. One day if I ever win the lottery I would love to donate there and give back for all their kindness and hospitality. Im a regular.<//Text>

<review>Amazing staff. Mostly friendly and helpful on many various issues. My views have changed on this business... Updated review:: Not very honest and direct. For example, I walked in there to simply check my mail and it was like I just walked into a high security meeting for President Obama and the French Prime Minister wearing a chicken outfit. Like, I, as you can tell from my previous review that I liked, if not, loved this place. Something changed Though and  I was the last to find out.. so good luck if you need a trustworthy, welcoming place to feel accepted and get assistance that's not genuine.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2a4d30f51a555:0xaaa1f82a225a2de8< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I'm going to rate it 3 stars based on my personal experience. I'm sure experience may differ based on the person but I'm 23 years old. And I went searching for help with maybe housing.  Addresses. Different amenities. And they handed me a sandwich and told me to come another day...  Looks like I'll just go another day. Just a homeless collage student trying to survive</review></record></dataset><record>

<date>1558188143803<//date><rating>1< /rating><Review>Very very rude disrespectful ignorant crooked staff. Seems they only cater to junkie pos opposed to helping someone who helps themself. I've had 3 caseworkers since late 2017. All they do is set you up by making appointments then when you show up they're not there and never call. Big cherryele is just a big dream killer. She tells you your goals are not reachable because she thinks she knows everthing but really her and her people are just a bunch of haters. One time I laughed because she denied me a bread roll. LMFAO who does that to a homeless man? Even her co worker knew that was petty af. Anywho im through with this place. Thank God I dont have to go here anymore to get my mail because it was one sherade/shenanigan after another. I guess they get a kick out of abusing/challenging the mentally ill. Thats okay though I will let God take care of them. I pray he has mercy on them when karma comes around.

<user_name>Judy Hill<//user_name><resp>None< /resp><Text>This is the most dehumanizing place I have seen in my life. They make people go from a tiny dry room to going outside in pouring rain to get drenched to come back inside again. Makes no sense at all. Today I went to eat and get a shower but they were more intent on harassing me. Because I do not fit the traditional profile of a homeless person, they thrive on emotional abuse like denial of services, discrimination, etc. I tried to get a cup of coffee before my shower and they refused to give me one. The large man who was a volunteer was extremely combative and abusive. He made the comment they allowed harassment when it comes to me. Then I went to prepare to get in the shower in an out of the way spot and two big black women started harassing me for being in a fire lane. I moved and came back to get a towel and they demanded I get behind 10 people who came in after me. When I expressed how upset I was at their cruelty, the big black woman refused to let me take a shower and said not to come back. They refused to give me one of the wellness beds they advertise even after their doctor ordered it. Big time bait and switch. Even the Santa Monica police who tried to help me get into their shelters could not find a number that answered. When the nice policeman asked for.a hotel voucher because I have medical problems and am a crime victim, they refused because I do.not have children. They have millions in funding but only three case managers who only handle 25 clients a piece. They have at least 10 shelters that are inaccessible to people like me. It is a shame they are more interested in abusing me than helping me.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4d30f51a555:0xaaa1f82a225a2de8<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

<Review>Most of the staff are nice. Forget the showers, Its a small room with 5 showers and 3 sinks and it is always packed. They do have free handouts like a sack lunch and some dinners but zero security and near fights all the time that staff has to break up. You can get minor free medical services on certain day. They have limited clothes. Forget about getting a bed here. You will have a 3 to 4 week wait just to see a counselors that can help you get on general relief which is about 200 a month. They try but they need better organization. Most blacks in LA are more hostile than in other parts of the country so be prepared to fight. The plus is it is walking distance from Venice beach.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>Don't go to this place if you don't look like the stereotypical homeless person because they won't help you with NOTHING, it is as if they want you to be smelling and eating out of the garbage cans before they offer you any help and by that time it's usually too late for many, which leads to many of the chronic homeless situations we see around Santa Monica, etc. This place is apart of the problem and not the solution. There needs to a complete overhaul of this place, from Management on down to the rest of staff, OPPC is why the homeless problem has gotten worse and not better throughout Santa Monica.< /Text>< response>

<text>Breakfast Sandwich, burger at 4 pm, big weekend lunches, showers, free phone calls.
Free Medical clinic 1pm-3pm
20 laundry time slots weekly, 4 people each weekday. The line starts the day  before, you will get a camping ticket if u  sleep or laydown.
You get a case manager after a few months.
If your lucky you can get a Locker. 12x16x36".
If your disabled you might get into one of their transitional housing programs.
It could take years.
I was homeless there for 5 years.
Then I got into S.A.M.O.S.H.E.L. next door, took a year to prove my disability. Took another year to get my section 8 voucher. If you lived or worked in Santa Monica recently you may qualify for a Santa Monica voucher.
Most people get a Los Angeles voucher.

S.A.M.O.S.H.E.L. "SAMO" is just a tent. It's cold, 63°most of the time. It has 77 clients,12 employees, half the clients are crazy or high and won't shower.
Drunks screaming at night, fights, theft, sexual harassment, death threats, ciggarette smoke coming in from the side door and office window, handfuls of filth falling from the unkept HAVAC Ducts overhead. Flooding from rain. Dogs, dog bites, fleas.
Gangbangers selling drugs on the sidewalk despite security.
BEDBUGS!! BEDBUGS!!! BEDBUGS!! BEDBUGS!! BEDBUGS!!
They do treatments but don't enforce daily showers like ALL THE OTHER "SHELTERS" IN AMERICA!!!!!!
OR
A free bus ticket to anywhere you can confirm with a phone call to that location that they will take you "off the street".
But it takes a week.
Instead just go to the police Dept and ask for Officer Ron Hooks.
He patrols the beach dressed in blue handing out granola bars and driving people to the Greyhound bus with a free ticket "home" and some meal vouchers for the trip after they run you for warrants.
If you stay in Santa Monica you will be ticketed 10 times more than any other city.
You will pay $400 or more each ticket or go to jail for the weekend.
If you plead innocent you wait in jail for a month!
These are some common tickets -Using a pillow, blanket, tent, box, or being 25 feet of doorway, being in a closed park, even the beach!</text>< username>

If you want to die in the gutters of Santa Monica with a free bologna sandy-witch in your belly after being injected with Reptilian NAZI Jew Death Sauce then OPCC is the place for you. There are no Social Services for Human people at OPCC or Los Angeles County because LA County is "The Swamp" full of Reptilian NAZI JEWS__Telepathic, Collective, Mind Controlling Savage Reptilians__we must drain the SWAMP!<//text>

<Text>Wish I knew about this place sooner! We tried their La Vera Clasic with chicken and wow it was delicious. It was stacked with toppings! For the price and quality this is probably the best pizza spot in town. I highly recommend this place! Definitely coming back< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Absolutely 💯 delicious. The Wings are amazing and the pizza 🍕 is hands down some of the best Pizza in Santa Barbara County, period. Great Service. Great prices. Must have if you are in town... locally owned. Great food and portions.</Text>

First I would like to say is the girl that took my order was very polite. Second the young man named Juan gave me excellent customer service. He cares about his job and the qualityof service. This pizza was the best pizza I have had in a long time, we order the divine swine and the Mexicana. This is my new pizza place I will be back soon.< /text>

<Time>1590681641943</Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I have been to La Vera Pizzeria many times because it is the best pizza in Santa Maria. It is owned and operated by a local family who has been around for many years and far surpasses all of the pizza chain restaurants in quality and price. La Vera is the only pizza I get in Santa Maria at this point. My favorite is the combo pizza because they load it with so many toppings! The cheap price does not reflect the quality of the ingredients or the generous servings.

To mix things up, I recently tried a sandwich from there too. This had not been my go-to sandwich place in SM, but after having their pastrami sandwich, I will definitely be going back for more. I never go out of my way to write reviews on the internet, but I was so blown away by this sandwich and their family has been so good to me for so long that I thought this was the least I could do.

Oh and don't forget the buffalo wings! And make sure you get some of their homemade ranch dressing for dipping your pizza, wings, and salads!!</text>< pictures>

Delicious pizzas and great pastrami sandwiches too! Pizza was loaded with toppings- they are not skimpy when you ask for extra and it was all for a really good price! The crust is cooked perfectly every time< /Review>

“Awesome" may be the most overused word around. Most things in life are ordinary, not awesome. I have eaten at dozens of Italian and pizza specialty restaurants, in New York, Chicago and also in Italy. La Vera pizza is awesome! It is so good, you naturally pause and slow down to better enjoy. Every element is of the highest quality, including the skills and dedication of the brother and sister owners. From crust and sauce, toppings to table, they serve the best. That's awesome.< /text>

A large La Vera Specialty, added jalapenos, and an order of spicy wings (asked to have them extra crispy).  Pizza was perfect, AS ALWAYS. A 10 OUT OF 10. The wings weren't as crispy as I would have liked...that's why I didn't give a 5 STAR.  But the taste was really REALLY good.</Text>

<review>Drove five hours for my mom's 72nd birthday, asked her where she wanted to go out to eat for her birthday, she wanted go to a place that served pizza; after looking at the reviews on yelp and Google, the La Vera Pizzeria would be a good place to take my mom. When we arrive and walking towards the entrance, (a manager or employee) outside the establishment talking on the phone blocked the entrance to go in; with her left-hand up she mentioned to us to stop, then waved her left index finger side to side, all without saying a word. Does this pizzeria have a dress code,was the (manager or employee) having a bad day; has happened to anyone else?<//review>< Pics>

One of my preferred locations for quality mediterranean food. Came here on a Friday I think. Really nothing but great experiences here, so I will be back. Prices were reasonable. Makes me feel like I am back in Tucson.< /text>

Food quality on Wednesday was quite poor.  Outside atmodphere is nice, but doesn't make up for inferior food or chef.  Used to come here often before it closed and remodeled.  Restaurant seems to have gone through 3 cycles over the last 6+ years, each worse.  Now menu is very small with relatively little selection.  Vegetable add-ons are poorly cooked and flavored.  Seafood and burgers are over-cooked.  Even blueberry bread pudding of first restaurant iteration was pretty ordinary.  Won't be back.</text>

Tapas y Vino closed about 6 months ago, it is now 1892 Bistro (the founding year of Redondo Beach), Andy is still one the owners. The motif has changed a lot, the menu has some additions and deletions. Definitely worth trying again.<//text>

One of my fav hangout spots in redondo.  I often get the nightly special tapas. Always good. great little place in Redondo.. If you live in south bay,  I would def check it out.
They have a cute little fireplace outside that you can sit around and enjoy a glass of wine .<//Review>

Food can vary from excellent to ok. Love some of the tapas. Others not as much. The sangria is very good. Also love the scallop and sausage dishes. Check the menu and if it sounds good to you, you will likely be happy. Wish the wine program had better Spanish selections at actual spanish wine prices.</Text>

<Time>1319039151297<//Time><Rate>3<//Rate><Review>The food was excellent and our server (Jerome) was very attentive and helpful.  I had the duck breast with couscous and my girlfriend had the Black Cod.   The mushroom/manchego cheese appetizer was ok...seemed like the preparation was a little rushed.   They also have a great wine selection....but no bottles under $32.  The bottle we had Evodia (2009) was $38 but sells in the stores for $7.   I guess i just can't get over the high 500% mark up in restaurants.  It just seems a little a little extreme.

The ambiance was ok.  You can tell they're trying.   But the decor is a little conflicting.  It's a mix between modern and traditional.  The outdoor patio area is great....and they have heat lamps to keep it cozy and warm.  There's also a nice modern-style fire pit.     It's the inside that needs a little face lift to keep up with the modern/contemporary feel i believe they're trying to achieve.    Also, the television behind the bar is a bit distracting.  It's constantly on even when there is no game.

I gave it a 3 because the ambiance clash.   One of the main reasons I enjoy a restaurant is because of the ambiance.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd4b5744f0b043:0x1fabd671940636c5<//Gmap_id></record>

The food was pretty good, but a bit expensive for the food you get, even for a tapas place, where I don't expect the food to be cheap. I'd totally go again if someone else was paying for it.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Feeling at home with great food and under the direction of a gentleman who truly loves good food.
Attention to the new look that the restaurant will offer, there will be many news but always excellent and offers with passion and courtesy.

<Text>I came to garfield car wash today, I left my car perfectly fine when the time came to move my car and be washed, the worker broke my shift gear and when i asked what happened he told me that it broke and that it was bound to happen. I asked if they would take responsibility and they would not listen, when i asked the manager for the person who owned the car wash they told me they would not help and didn't get me his number. They were not professional and even tried blaming it on me. I now have to pay out of my pocket to fix it.</Text>< rating>

They wash my car but they did not vacuum the back seats. They were still dirty with sand ( I had gone to the beach the day before). They told me to take it back to get it vaccumed. I forgot to Check the trunk when I was there but when I got home I opened it and it was all dirty. They did not even bothered to vacuum it. Never going back again.</Review>< Pics>

<text>I went in on Sunday morning to get my car cleaned. I got the 3 Star package. When I received  my car it had 3 scratches on the top of the trunk of my car. Two of them are light scratches and one is thicker. I cant believe they scratched my car and my car is brand new still. I called to see what they could help with but instead of helping or listening the lady on the phone just kept arguing saying that her car wash machine does not scratch cars making it seem like she was calling me a lier. I am very upset because like I mentioned I just recently purchased this car and since it is black those scratches are very visible. I wouldnt wish this onto anyone else.<//text>< user_name>

<review>Just went there to get my car washed and I had to come home and re vacuum the interior as well as my convertible top again. I feel I could of taken it to the express and paid the 12 dollars and come out with a cleaner car. These were $30 gone to waste.</review>< pictures>

Had to wash my car because some punk kids egged it! This was my first time using a carwash like this and it was a little bit expensive, but the car came out clean and new looking! If only I could find who hit my car and give them the bill!</Review>

Can't recommend this place as my car was still dirty, and I had to point it out to the guys.. no attention to detail, the workers just go through the motions...(Thurs Sept 20 just before closing)  definitely not worth $14.00<//Text>

<Name>Lisa Mogis< /Name><Pics>None</Pics><Text>Paid for wash with tires to be dressed with AmorAll.
Guy flagged the truck was ready and I pointed out that no armorall had been applied to the tires.
I show him my receipt,  he grabs it and looks at it and then went to ask the guy in charge something.
Finally returned and applied armorall with a less than pleasant attitude.
Won't be back again.< /Text>< userid>

(Translated by Google) Very poorly washed. I'm shocked how can this be? A few people washed my car and the condition is terrible. Although there is nothing complicated here, just wipe the dust and vacuum it well. No, they do not know how to do this. They didn't even get rubber mats. They also remained dirty and did not vacuum clean under them.
I'm sorry, I like to praise, but not this time ...

(Original)
Очень плохо помыли.  Я в шоке как так можно? Несколько человек мыло мою машину и состояние ужасное.  Хотя ничего сложного здесь нет, просто пыль протереть и хорошо пропылесосить. Нет, не умеют и этого делать.  Даже резиновые коврики не достали. Они остались тоже грязные и под ними не пылесосили.
Очень жаль,  люблю хвалить,  но не в этот раз...< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) Do not agree because if you paid it is because I want to see a good wash, not the vacuum cleaner well, they did not clean it well, they did not put ARMORALL well, they did not put sera. And for this same reason I better wash it, I was always happy when I wash it myself, I check all the details I paid 45 to be very unhappy, for a good wash only myself. I do not recommend them

(Original)
No quede conforme pues si pagó es porque quiero ver un buen lavado, no la aspiradora bien, no la limpiaron bien,  no le pusieron ARMORALL bien, no le pusieron sera.  Y por esta misma razón mejor la lavo yo siempre quedó feliz cuando la lavo yo mismo reviso todos los detallitos pague 45 para quedar muy inconforme, pata un buen lavado sólo uno mismo.

<text>This review is for the JCP Salon; specifically for Sally. She is awesome! She really takes her time and makes sure that you get exactly what you want. She is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I am extremely picky because I have naturally curly hair and am always hesitant going to a new stylist. She has cut, colored and treated my hair and every time I have been extremely pleased. Ask for Sally, trust me you will not be disappointed!< /text><username>Lilia Mendez Covarrubias<//username><user>107109217490240938698< /user></record>

<Text>Paid for a watch. Cerk didn't remove the plastic start stop piece on watch. Got home and tried to remove piece. Could not remove returned to store clerk broke watch in attempt.  Store did not have same watch that my wife wanted for her Birthday. A complete waste of a Sunday. J C Penny is about 15 miles from my house 1 way. I will not shop there again.<//Text>< user>

<review>Good sales. Good quality. Lots of items not priced and confusing. Lousy customer service. No fault of the employee, just way understaffed. Took me 15 minutes to get the price of an item. Big box weighed over 30 lbs carrying it all over the store. Not like the JCPenny of before.</review>< user_name>

<text>The store closed at 7 and we were at the register by 7:05. We asked nicely if she could open the front door because my grandma has a heart condition and we parked the car by that main entrance the lady was super rude when we asked nicely.

Turns out you HAVE to go to the changing rooms to try the pants they sell.
Not even a warning, they kick me out, the story of my life.< /review>

Penny's, please clean up your store. The dressing rooms are falling apart with pealing wallpaper, ugly dirty carpet and where is the seating for people waiting at the fitting rooms. Really very sad, the service is excellent but please show pride in your stores.</Text>

<Time>1539129647701</Time><text>Sephora did my makeup & Vanity knocked it out of the park!!!! 😍
I would not hesitate to go there again - the only thing that needs improvement is that someone needs to be taking care of customers who rudely interrupt the ladies who are obviously busy & their customers are obviously on a time schedule for events, which is why they are getting their makeup done!! Having someone stay near in that area would take that burden off & only makes sense. Instead, I watched both ladies have to stop what they were doing & look around for others to help & to only have to give up & answer the questions as quickly as possible so they could get back to the makeup. Whoever is the one in charge of scheduling needs to realize that Friday & Saturdays are just going to be busy & adding in makeup appointments are excellent for business, but not when it makes ladies late!! If you see appointments, then put extra floor help!! Women are naturally curious when they see the makeup being done & want to ask questions....soooo, have someone available to help them & you will get more sales all around - but of course, that's just my opinion 😉
Give Vanity a raise though because she is definitely a keeper 😍</text><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

One goes in to change some cloth for another size and u are hit with the credit card pitch and convince u to buy it on credit once u need to pay it on line it a hassle can't get a person to talk to all u get is the automatic teller with is no help to anyone Your system sucks big time that's why I don't like to get things started on credit. One thing for sure is I am going to pay what I owe and tear the dam card up.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is a good place to go shopping, the cool thing is that they give credit even being from Mexico 👌. They always receive you super friendly, from the moment you open the door there is someone who greets you, you find good and beautiful clothes, a lot of order as well as cleanliness, and some specials ... Although lately I have not found many 🤔 but there is still the ease of purchase on credit 😁 ... Of course, be careful because you must pay on time or you will be fined!

Es un buen lugar para ir de compras, lo padre es que dan crédito aún siendo de México 👌. Siempre te reciben súper amables, desde que abres la puerta hay alguien que te saluda, encuentras buena y bonita ropa, mucho orden así como limpieza, y algunas especiales...

Eso sí, ten cuidado porque debes pagar a tiempo o te multan!< /review><Response>None</Response>< name>

(Translated by Google) On this visit I had a very bad experience, they treated me as a criminal, I am disabled and they made me walk a lot and I ended up with a lot of pain in my legs when I went to measure my clothes they made me take out the cart that because I did not enter I told the person who I was in my underwear and he told me to take it out since Alcabo was not seeing ... 😠😠😠

(Translated by Google) Not very good. Messy clothes. There is no one to guide you (employees). So they closed the Calexico branch. Be careful because the one at Imperial Valle Mall is going to close if it continues to neglect its customers.

(Original)
No muy buena. La ropa desordenada. No hay quien te oriente (empleados). Por eso cerraron la sucursal de Calexico. Tengan cuidado porque la del Imperial Valle  Mall va para el cierre si sigue descuidando a sus clientes.<//Review>
