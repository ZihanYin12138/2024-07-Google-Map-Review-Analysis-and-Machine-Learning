< review>
AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!! Cannot understand their rental process. Was trying to become a customer, but they made it EXTREMELY difficult after multiple calls from different agents and managers. Everyone was telling me to do something different. I was trying to rent, but couldn't do it. Incredibly bizarre system and confusing. Customer service is horrible. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.

2 days later - Was contacted by management to rectify the situation. They went out of their way to understand the problem I was having and managed to accommodate my needs. Because of the prompt action of their team, I have revised my review. Storage units were clean and location felt safe. Thank you for reaching out.< /review>

<name>Erin Beyer< /name><text>This review should be ZERO stars. My best advice to you is Don't put anything you value here. My daughter's unit was broken into 2 weeks ago and according to the OCSD this is a common occurrence but what does Public Storage do to stop it?  NOTHING!  What does Public Storage do to help you protect your belongings? NOTHING! What do they do to investigate the crime and who has been on the premises? NOTHING!  What does Public Storage do to increase security? NOTHING! There are lots of other storage facilities in the area.  This one is the worst!</text><time>1598981856644<//time><Rate>1</Rate>< gmapID>

Olga has been in the office scenic I have been using the faculty. She knows her stuff. Always ready to help in any way she can. When I couldn’t remember my code she came out to the gate to help. The grounds are always clean, tidy and nothing ever lying around. Best in the west is my given Moro. I’ll be here forever.

Miguel was such a huge help to me while I transferred my unit! He walked me through the units that were available and made sure I knew how much each space was and the timing I had to move. He was friendly and very efficient while helping me with the transfer process. He was available for anything I needed during the day of moving. He went above and beyond to help, I appreciated it so much. I highly recommend using this public storage in San Juan for your storage needs. Ask for Miguel! 🌟</Review>

Olga. Olga. Olga. Every experience has been amazing anything you need she knows the answer. Very personable. I have had run-ins with my partner who shares the storage unit and she has had to deal with a ton of stuff that she JUST GETS IT DONE!   Any issue you may have you ask for Olga.  Any information you need she knows off the top of her head do you need to get in and out and rent a storage unit ask for Olga I’m telling you she has helped me in the last six months so many times. thank you so much Olga  I will miss you hope I don’t need to rent another storage unit</Text>

<review>I would recommend this Public Storage location.  They keep it very clean and they are very helpful.  Miguel is a great property manager and always keeps his eyes open to make sure everyone is safe.  I also see him sweeping the property while making his rounds.  Thank you Miguel for your great customer service!!!  Happy Holidays to you and your family!!!!

Called Public Storage after visiting a few in San Clemente, was initially only supposed to need 6 months and they had an amazing special going on. (I believe they offer specials frequently). We rented with Olga who showed us all the ropes! She got me all the boxes, tape, storage paper a girl could need. All while my crazy daughter ran a muck. Olga was very helpful and understanding. Thank you Olga for all your help! So far we have been in our unit for 10 months, our rent went up at about 6 months, we received a special when we moved in so it came as no surprise. Also, we ended up getting ants in our unit and Olga offered to spray the outside, which was very helpful. The property is extremely clean and being an experienced storage user, ants happen. Just used Terro Liquid Ant Bait, all dead within 3 days.<//review>

<Text>I have been renting with public storage for a few months now and have had a wonderful experience. I had to ship a “POD” from another state and was unable to unload it when it arrived due to sick kiddos. The property manager Olga was so kind and understanding. I’m grateful they were able to work with me on pushing back my pick up date. Thank you Olga & Public Storage SJC for understanding “the snowball affect” lol!< /Text>< pictures>

Olga is amazing at this location - she has helped me move from NYC to SoCal in so many ways. I’ve rented two different sized units from her, and both units have been perfect. The facility is clean and easy to access, there are plenty of supplies available if you need them, and the rates are excellent. All around a wonderful experience here!< /text>

<text>This is by far the best storage around for 2 reasons.
1- it was the cheapest for our size, with great specials.
2- Olga is the sweetest property manager ever. She makes you feel so comfortable and is willing to help you out in any way she can. Very accommodating and goes out of her way to make sure each customer is happy. Anytime I recommend storage to friends/family, you bet it will be here.<//text><UserId.>108474938646505793104<//UserId.>< time>

I have been with Public Storage for over 18 years right here in San Juan Capistrano. I’ve always been impressed with the cleanliness and how friendly the staff are through the years but the last five years have been the best with their current manager Olga! She is always there to help with any questions or needs and manages the facility like it was her own!  I appreciate that kind of spirit and attitude and Public Storage should be very proud as well.

<review>Olga was so helpful as she always is when I make my monthly rental payments here at her facility. I appreciate the convenience of coming to her place for that purpose saving me a half hour drive to my actual storage address.

<Review>This Public Storage facility is great!! Very competitive rates and the manager is awesome! Friendly, courteous, and very helpful. They definitely go over and beyond to be helpful. The facility is very clean and secure. My job requires me to have a storage unit so I've definitely sampled my fair share of storage facilities in the area and hands down Public Storage is the cleanest, safest and the best!<//Review><resp>None< /resp>< Time>

Second time customer. Literally reached out to every storage unit within a 40mile radius. Not a single one of them came close to the level of customer service or attention to detail that Olga provided. Enthusiastically recommended.</Text>

Very clean, well maintained, climate controlled facility. We had a space there for five years and received consistently excellent customer support. A special thanks to Olga, whose professionalism and helpful attitude were so very refreshing. I endorse this facility and location without hesitation!< /Text>

<Review>Olga was extremely helpful today in helping me rent another unit.   She is always kind and helpful.  When I was late with a payment one month I received a very pleasant message to remind me and offer assistance if I needed it.   Very nice instead of a computerized rude message.  When I needed another unit I returned here, because of Olga, even though I could have paid less at another facility.< /Review>< resp>

<Review>I got a great clean space and had excellent customer service.Thank you Olga! She is fast, efficient, thorough and above all very helpful. She made sure I had the right space for the amount of stuff I had to store. She knew I would be frequenting the facility to go through my things, so she set me up with a unit in a convenient drive up location. I would definitely recommend this storage facility to anyone.< /Review>< name>

I had an amazing experience at this establishment. Everyone was completely helpful, and made moving a pleasant experience. Olga in particular was the most helpful and one of the best experiences I've had with someone through customer service setting I would highly recommend using this establishment. I would give more stars if I could. This business its employees go way above and beyond the call of duty.</Review>

<Text>Ivan is GREAT!  If he wasn't on top of things so well, I would DEFINITELY have forgotten to pay my bill.  He called me 3 times to remind me because with each phone call he could see that I intended to pay it but had forgotten.  I'm very happy with him and with Public Storage.

Olga is absolutely fantastic. I've had a couple of mishaps that were completely my fault during my time here (including losing my storage keys), and she's been able to help me with all of them. If you're looking for a great storage facility with top-notch customer service, look no further.< /review>

<Text>I chose Public Storage because of the location and convenience, but wasn't expecting that I would also get such helpful and friendly service. Ivan was very prompt at returning my call after I made an online reservation, and gave me great customer service once I arrived. He was so personable and friendly that I instantly felt like I had made the right decision, and would be taken care of at Public Storage.

It was absolutely painless to get a storage area quickly.  The office staff was absolutely amazing and let me know of some promotions I'd missed.  I'd definitely do business here again!</Review>

Ivan is GREAT!  If he wasn't on top of things so well, I would DEFINITELY have forgotten to pay my bill.  He called me 3 times to remind me because with each phone call he could see that I intended to pay it but had forgotten.  I'm very happy with him and with Public Storage.  Thanks Ivan!< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Olga was incredible today.  She not only offered me the best customer service ever but made it fun and interesting as well.  She made a very stressful situation better by a long shot.  She has a warming smile that is genuine and heartwarming. Never thought I'd be doing such a review but decided to do so before leaving the area and letting it slip by.  Thanks for making sure you employ people like Olga.

Olga at San Juan storage has been very helpful in everyway. I really like how personable she has been, going the extra mile of walking to my unit to inform me of things as well as giving me a reminder call so i dont aquire late fees. She is awesome and takes ownership to her job.</review>

Great customer service from Robert when helping me look at units today. I need a place to put my sea doos for the next six months and if I do end up leaving them in a closed storage unit I will be sure to use this public storage. Thanks Robert for all your help.</Text>

< Review>
Jose is the store manager for this facility. I have used this location twice. The first time is when I came to California from Utah. I called ahead of time and spoke to Jose. Upon arriving all arrangements were exactly as we had discussed, and Jose, besides being one heck of a nice guy, is very efficient with what he does. The first time I used the deposit (largest unit available) for about 7 months, with the price being about $430 a month.
The second time was two years later and once again I spoke to Jose. This time the deal was more expensive for the largest of their units. I paid $484 a month for the exact same size I had used two years prior. Inflation, cost of living? What else does not go up in price year after year. I did not like the hike but I was assured that these units actually cost $600 plus a month! Jose, once again, recognized us and like always treated us with the best of customer service skills.
He certainly is an asset for Public Storage. In our two times we rented there, everyone in the office gave us the best of services. I feel this location deserves recognition, and I am very happy I can put my two cents worth.
Jose is top notch management. He is a good guy, and if there is a sale going on, he will go out of his way to save someone some money. He told us that if we vacated before the 10th of the month, we were entitled for a pro rated rate.
Professional, courteous and fast on the keyboards. No unnecessary delays.  By the way, I checked several competing storages and in the end Public Storage won hands down. Thank you, Jose, and good luck with the business. 5 Stars!
PS: Another reviewer says the name is Juan but I am 99% is Jose?!<//Review>

I have had huge financial problems stemming from a son debilitated by serious mental illness. After eviction from home of 10 years and scrambling to put the most important, irreplaceable personal belongings, into Public Storage in San Juan Capistrano, I found myself unable to pay for it. I had found job as caregiver, w room and board thankfully, but 5 mos w/out pay awaiting gov work approval. I was stressed out to lose my, and my sons< /review>

The first time is when I came to California from Utah. I called ahead of time and spoke to Jose. Upon arriving all arrangements were exactly as we had discussed, and Jose, besides being one heck of a nice guy, is very efficient with what he does. The first time I used the deposit (largest unit available) for about 7 months, with the price being about $430 a month.
The second time was two years later and once again I spoke to Jose. This time the deal was more expensive for the largest of their units. I paid $484 a month for the exact same size I had used two years prior. Inflation, cost of living? What else does not go up in price year after year. I did not like the hike but I was assured that these units actually cost $600 plus a month! Jose, once again, recognized us and like always treated us with the best of customer service skills.
He certainly is an asset for Public Storage. In our two times we rented there, everyone in the office gave us the best of services. I feel this location deserves recognition, and I am very happy I can put my two cents worth.
Jose is top notch management. He is a good guy, and if there is a sale going on, he will go out of his way to save someone some money. He told us that if we vacated before the 10th of the month, we were entitled for a pro rated rate.
Professional, courteous and fast on the keyboards. No unnecessary delays.  By the way, I checked several competing storages and in the end Public Storage won hands down. Thank you, Jose, and good luck with the business. 5 Stars!
PS: Another reviewer says the name is Juan but I am 99% is Jose?!< /Review>< pictures>

So much was awesome about my experience here. I dont where to begin. But if i were to put it in word
.....its OLGA ....Her customer service and true love of what she does and product knowledge about the storage business is unbelivable i this day and age. I admire her dedication to all of her customers as I have observed her with other clients and her professionalism an care is consistant and sincere.
Its a team effort at this storage facility when most are in a stressful place moving or whatever the case may be.
Ill hate to leave when the time comes.  She is an asset to the company and the entire public storage experience. Your the best Olga. I love you and Public Storage...</review>

I personally enjoy having a storage unit at this Public Storage branch,
there is so much shown by all the staff, smiling faces, loving greeting tactics to all the costumers that I have seen go in and out while there in office and on grounds,,
this Public Storage make you feel Comfortable like your with Family and as well makes you feel at home,,
My Wife and I are Very Pleased with this Public Storage, they keep it safe, secure, clean, and if ever any issue with anything even another tenant to running out of toilet papper/ or papper towels if you tell the staff its an automatic fix,
they deal with any issue quick and promt to all tenants needs,,

They have at this Public Storage in San Juan Capistrano, Cali.
A Lady Named Olga I believe she may be the manager, well i'll tell you she is A doll, a treat to see when we go in the office and or when she does her rounds around the grounds Olga is Funny, Smart, Loving, Kind, courageous, keen, wonderful spirit,
Olga Makes My Wife and I feel Happy overtime we show up  to our unit Olga brightens up our Day,,
Thank You all for the Love Shown at this Public Storage,

PS we have stored at several Public Storages and this is the best so far,,,<//text>

<review>I got a cheap Lionhart tire from them and it was overpriced. This place has decent customer service, but you can get a better deal at Americas Tire. Americas Tire is called Discount Tire outside of California, they have stellar customer service and better deals.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I've been here so many times for tires, oil changes, mechanical problems. Even to fix my automatic window. They always tell you exactly what's wrong with your car, or even what's not wrong with it. I even went in with a check engine light on. They ran the test on the car and said it was the gas cap. Instead of telling me the only way to find out was to do extensive, expensive tests. I won't take our cars any where else.<//Text>

I wish I can rate this with no stars. Worst customer experience I had. The 2 bald a-holes that work in the front are rude and disrespectful. Because of them I will never come here or recommend anyone to go there unless you want the same experience as I did. These guys do not know how to work with people. Avoid this place. You will get better service somewhere else.<//text>

They didn't fix my tire though i had RHZ warranty. They think the fact i used a plug myself causes the tire to get worse in a way they cant fix it anymore. The bold guy literally told me that i lost my insurance for that and he got mad and his tone got aggressive. I filed a claim to their official site and never even got a reply. They don't care about customers. Lucky they didn't get sued yet. I'm never going to Discount Tire Centers anymore. We were discussing the flat tire and he started giving me some illogical replies by saying that they gave me a good offer (buy 2 tires get 2 free) when i first bought tires and he said u refused to change lower control arm which caused the second tire to get worse. The fool was surprized when i told him i already changed it right away immediately after he told me to do so but i did it somewhere else. These guys are bad. Either go to other branch or never go there at all.< /Text>

I got the full tire package for all four tires. The guys are quick, on point, and more than happy to explain things like im 5. I do not know anything about tires, but the guy explained everything to me honestly (I cross referenced his explination on google later). Then recently I hit a pot hole and ripped up two tires. I did not know how much the wheel insurance covered so I was scared at first, thinking I might have been cheated into paying more to have it all void by some technicality. I brought it in. Gave a quick explination. The guy looks at it, looks at my paper work, and explains that he will be neeeding my keys to swap, rotate, and align the vehicle. The only thing I payed for was for the service. I walked out with two new wheels. I will be bringing my business here more often.<//review>

I come here most mornings to pick up something to get me through the day and honestly this is the best Burger King I've ever been to.  I'm not sure if it's the proximity to I-5 or what but the morning crew is always on top of it.  Both the breakfast and lunch items are always amazing.  Keep up the great work!</review>

<text>This place is on point! I have lived here for about 20 years and can tell you out of all the fast food here in Williams BK takes 1st place! Always fast and food is fresh. Customer service good be a little friendlier but the speed of service and great prices (I have a family of 5 and can feast on 20$!!!) UNBEATABLE!!! Please don't change what you're doing.</text>< gmap_id>

They were open when I needed it. I was traveling from Redding to Southern Ca. And stopped by for a quick bite. This location was open when other places were not. I appreciated that. Thank you!</text>

Onion rings were fresh Restaurant could’ve been cleaner next time I order my whopper Junior hold the flies. Is Burger King could be a lot better if it is focused on cleanliness that’s why it’s getting to stars< /Text>

<Text>Bathrooms were disgusting with feces, feminine hygiene products on the floor. No soap, so how are employees washing their hands? Then when we went out to the side yard to stretch, the door was locked back in. The gate out of the yard was locked too. I had to phone a family member in the car to come in and free us.</Text>< Pictures>

Burgers were good as any other BK. Fries were cool and a bit under cooked but had the right amount of salt. The inside was pretty clean, a few stained ceiling tiles tho.< /Review>

The eating area obviously needed a wipe down and sweep. I had an impossible burger, that was burnt on one side, overdone (possibly double fried) mozzarella sticks, and my grandpa had underdone onion rings. The parking lot could use a spray down. Overall, there are enough fast food alternatives in Williams, CA, and I wish I would've gone to one of those.

Edit on 2/20/2020: Tried again, bathrooms were appalling, front room was better. They got 2 burgers wrong. One of them was still wrong the second time. 10/10 do not recommend.</Review>< user>

Quick food, kind staff, and high chairs were awesome But cleanliness was yuck. Tried to wipe down high chair and table in front of child. It was sticky and yellow brown stuff came off both on a baby wipe. Men's room was bad too, women's okay. We left quickly after seeing how bad the table was, glad we put down napkins for children to eat food off if needed.</review>

<Text>This place was the worst ....... The people were nice but they need to wipe out the staff and replace them with people who represent the company in a better way. The food was gross and my order was completely wrong. I returned the food the next morning since the restaurant was closed by the time I drove back and the morning manager was nice but there is no excuse for the laziness and lack of effort of the night shift employees<//Text></record>

Just know i will be filing for all the lazy and racist workers to get fired. First off cashier had an attitude off the back, all i asked was "are we able to order lunch here in the morning " because im from a different part of town. Then the person calling orders dont even call our order and sits there starring at us with the tray for my family and cousins. But when it came to others he callled the orders (mind you we're asian. I hope you guys change this or get whats coming.< /Review>< rating>

Really felt for our grand daughter who with health issues has to make specific careful choices. She was embarrassed because the request wasn't followed and we had finished by the time her replaced ment arrived. Sure they were busy but for a birthday treat we would have expected an immediate  replacement. Not a good look.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

It was crazy crowded when we went in there to get some food. Several buses of people were there but I can't fault the store for that. Food was typical Burger King food. Nothing great but it's quick, cheap, and right off I-5.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) One day I bought nuggets from the drive thru and they were horrible dry and hard, now I order them fresh and everything is fine I just have to wait longer, they are friendly and I like the place, I don't like the soda machine and it smells bad, they should renew it, I like food.

If you want a top notch burrito with quality ingredients, Como Esta Tequesta is the place to go.  They also have tasty grilled jalapenos and salsa if you are into spicy food.< /Text>

By far the smallest burrito I've ever had. Would need to order at least 2 to fill up. Taste and construction was great though.</Text>

I always have the same thing, super chicken burrito with refried beans and medium salsa. It's always good! Service is fast and friendly (especially the lovely lady who owns the place). It's a bit cramped inside, but there's seating outside too. Prices are reasonable.< /Review>

The carnitas is especially good, but their guacamole side, at extra cost, is very small.  It is best to order ahead and pick it up, since a line could take quite a long time.<//review>< Pics>

Very good food for lunch,  but do not plan to eat there. There is a little seating outside and a very small, noisy amount of seating inside.

The pricing is very good and the food portions are very generous. They also serve breakfast, which is something in short supply in the Midtown area.< /Review>

The carnitas in the   regular burrito was moist and full of flavor, the refried beans and rice were authentic tasting. The salsa selection was okay, but the added perk  is that there is no additional  charge for extra  salsas The price of the burrito is slightly more affordable than other taquerias within the vicinity.
**I went back today to try the fish tacos OMG they rocked my world! The fish portion was generous and the taco was flavorful and delicious. Thank you for the side of chips and hot salsa. You all made my day!!</text>

Good options for vegans and health conscious people. The flavors and quality are much better than nearby locations. This is our go to Mexican place. Humble and friendly people and charming decor. Definitely suggest over other mexican places in the area.< /Review>

The quality here fluctuates. At times, they have the best burritos in the area - other times things can be pretty flavorless. It’s worth a shot if your nearby.

It seems that a few months ago they changed their tortillas, which now get soggy too fast. As a result, I recommend the burrito bowls<//Review>

Update 5 years after my first review: Como Esta is simply fantastic. The staff are always welcoming and friendly, and the food consistently delicious. 11/10 will keep visiting, even if just for takeout in 2020.</review><rating>5<//rating>< Pictures>

<review>I had the super tufo ranchero burrito bowl vegetarian dish and it was acceptable in flavor. If the veggies weren't slightly overcooked, I believe there would have been more flavor. This is my first time here.</review><rating>3</rating></record>

<Text>I went in and ordered food. The cashier didn't give me a receipt. I noticed there was a sign stating that if you don't receive a receipt then your meal is free. I notified the cashier. He pulled the receipt out of the trash and said he tried giving it to me, calling me a liar, and denied me. I will never go there again.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

The space is small and limited seating right next to the counter... However, the food is consistently good and the service is quick at any time other than the lunch rush (around 11:45 - 1:30).< /Text>

<review>Fun little Mexican joint. Perhaps not super authentic, but very tasty. They are very vegetarian-conscious and have a good tofu burrito and beans without lard. I like the chile rellenos. Quick, cheap, and friendly service.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>Didn't buy anything due to the fact that a super burrito would've been over $8 with tax. Have no reason to doubt food would have been good and place was pleasant enough, but 8 bucks is too much for a burrito.<//Text>< GmapID>

Mediocre burrito charged at a little higher than the average price. Meat selection is good but the quality is unimpressive.

This is your average taqueria.<//Text>

Food poisoning!

Went there for lunch with friends from work.  I ordered the super prawns taco.  The prawns were undercooked, by I didn't think anything about it.  That night the food poisoning hit me!

Several others, like me, had their order messed up, but at least that doesn't cause 24 hours of pain & yuck...< /review>

This is like your typical taqueria, but it is very clean and well laid out on the inside. It isn't the type of taqueria that has great food but is a little rough around the corners. The service is really good.

They have a large selection of Tacos, Burritos, Quesadillas and dinner plates. My friends and I tend to get the Shrimp Quesadilla. The shrimp here are marinated in chiptole and are much better than at any other place in the area.

The only problem I have with this place is that they are not open on Sundays when I usually crave a quesadilla.</review>

The foods good but too expensive if you are a  vegetarian. $12 for a bowl of rice and beans with sprinkled lettuce is too much.< /Text>

The rice is too soft, the burrito is too dry, and there is not a good salsa selection. Service is great, but food is tasteless. Definitely not worth the money.</text>

I had double meat chicken teriyaki, my granddaughter had California sushi roll......both were excellent meals.  Price was very reasonable $20 for our meals and drinks.  I will eat here anytime I'm close to the Visalia mall< /Review>

Unfortunately  it's from the same person and he seems to be the owner or manager. The last 3 times that I purchased  my food there hes rude and impatient.  I can truly  say that I will not be eating there due to BAD SERVICE. I will take my money somewhere also.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>Ill give a 2 star rating based on portion size and price. Portions have greatly gone down at this location while the price has risen. I order chicken teriyaki with extra chicken and watch as they put the same amount as regular. I used to eat here a few times a week but now it really isn't worth the money. The quality has gone down since the new management has taken over.< /review><Date>1559356226834</Date>< username>

<review>Such a rip off!! This tiny amount of meat and veggies but look at all the rice. I guess they want to make it look like I'm receiving a lot of food. When I'm not!! I'll always remember this and get food elsewhere. Other the other hand, the Fresno mall store gives a good amount.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The prices are good too. We will come back here</Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Cheap. I recommend the teriyaki chicken roll. The steamed rice is really soft with just a touch of butter. The spicy salmon roll was a little bland. Good for the price.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80952f377ba73893:0x1e96e3b8ccda0f85</gmap_id>< user_id>

Just a good vibe there good part of town, people just like to be out and about over there. We've been playing baseball there for years so it's just a comfortable place for me. Thanks for all you guys do.</Review>

This place is not the most ideal for kids under the age of 10. There are parts of the play structure that are very challenging and involve big jumps from very up high. However there are swings and slides available for the youngins. The park does not have sand, it has wood chips. Benches for lunches and lots of grass. Basketball and a library<//review>

I worked here as Recreational Leader and my time here during Winter Camp was great! Love the facility. Very Home-like and there's plenty of things to do around. Good park to spend time with the kids!</Review>

<Text>This is a nice park. There are lots of people that use it for the basketball court and the swing sets and jungle gym. I've seen quite a few games of Sandman being played. The Parks and Rec staff keep close eyes on their kids, and the baseball field merges into other open areas as well as the paths along the surrounding waterways.
A library branch finishes the setup, making this a very nice public space.</Text><user>113698437492347551460<//user></record>

< review>
this is a quiet park next to a small library and strip mall. the main attraction is a small, fenced playground for smaller children which is often overrun by the daycare next door. nearby, you will find a baseball field, tennis courts, and basketball hoops.

the park is well-maintained and has a mix of shady/sunny and flat/mounded areas. there are a handful of picnic tables, but no grills.

the park is right next to mccartney street, and there is no fence, so you might choose to be concerned about your ball, frisbee, or child finding its way into traffic.< /review>

<Review>The grass is perfect for playing sports; no feces or many holes to fall in, having a picnic or napping if you prefer. The surroundings are safe with very little to no creepers. The basketball court is as smooth as it should be. Looks like a vety delightful park.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>A cute little park with a Tennis & basketball court, baseball diamond, a jungle gym and a small library. There are only a few picnic tables. But it is so close the Harbor Bay shopping center which has quite a few good restraunts. Also near the park are walking biking paths that run along a whole string of lagoons lined with flowers, willows, wooden bridges and water birds.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate><response>None< /response><user_id>117150211853621800164</user_id>< Name>

Leydecker park, you're a family friend
Got ballers, kids, grass, but for parking you'll need to fend
The playground is nice, not too shabby
There's also a full basketball court in case you're flabby

This park is pretty nice.  Has a playground for kids, large round field for things like ultimate frisbee, has a full basketball court, and a softball field.  The only thing is, that if there's an event, good luck finding parking.  Parking can be tough to get without an event going on.  Otherwise, a nice park.  Just make sure kids cross the street safely around here.< /Text>

Haven't been here in 6 years since my last tire change and I remember not being so fond of the service back then. I got new tires recently elsewhere for a great price but still needed my alignment taken care of but sadly, the place I went to doesn't offer alignments. -_-". Anyways, I called this place and Allen provided great customer service from start to finish. I felt really guilty when he kindly asked me in person why I didn't get tires with them. I was honest and told him how the other place had a great deal for the kind of tires I got (which I forgot to mention to him that they don't carry). However, little did I know, this place can price match! I should of checked out prices for similar tires because it really would of saved me time. Not that much a problem but now I have to go to two separate places, one to get my wheels rotated or fixed and another to get an alignment (I got the lifetime alignment btw). A one-stop shop would be more ideal  and is actually much more convenient. Sighs, if only i can go back in time and have gone here in the first place!<//text>

<review>Poor customer service, had to wait 24hrs and damaged my wheels.

I called first thing Friday morning, talked to the rep and he assured me my tires would be in at 11am and we set a 1pm appointment. I see the work order via text, 225 and 255 tires, perfect. My car has very breakable aluminum lug bolts so I bring in my wheels loose. I arrive for my appointment, the guy at the counter has me verify the size. It's wrong, 245 not 255 like the work order. Okay whatever, its the same size as what's on there now. Hours go by. I call at 4:30pm, "Nope it's not done yet". I call at 5:30 to ask if it'll be done before close at 6pm, "No it's not done yet". I finally get a call after closing at 6pm after waiting more than FIVE hours. "Sorry don't be mad but we don't have your tires" and I get a story about how they were sold twice. Five plus hours after the appointment time and they look at my wheels...

The rep offers a 20% discount for my troubles, no point in getting mad so I get a ride home from my fiance since my car is now on jack stands at my parents' house. I get a call the next afternoon, I come down and the rep Aaron who had been talking to me on the phone is nowhere to be found. The manager is there and is very brusque, takes my payment and hustles me out. My rims are super grungy looking and I take them home.

My wheels were not in show condition but they never had front face damage. They all were greasy and dirty on the face of the rim and after cleaning now one of them has gouges in the paint. Like they had dragged them face down on a dirty work bench... I was able to save three of them with some cleaner wax but one now has permanent scratches. When I look inside it looks like they had removed the old weights with a flathead screw driver scratching the hell out of the inside of the rim. Some of them are deep enough to catch my nail. Totally unacceptable. Thank god I didn't bring my car in, who knows how much abuse it would have gotten in there. Avoid this place and don't risk your car with these people.<//review><user_id>100216617033324020094</user_id>< Name>

<Text>My tire popped, I called AAA and luckily they came early at 5:20. I was driving with a spare tire so I called around, one shop closed 15 minutes before their business hours and another shop didn't pick up the call at all. Then, I gave Wheel Works a call at 5:30 (closing time was 6:00), they took my car right away! Thank you so much and I'm so happy I came here at the last minute!
Great customer and affordable price for tires!<//Text>< username>

I used to do a lot of maintenance services at wheel works but this is the worst service. Bringing a my lexus and they asked to change oil brake but it has just been changed in other Wheel work for a year.  I decided to not change it and buy a test trip from amazon. The oil brake was still good with less than 1% water. Trying a second time with my Mercedes for tire rotation and alignment and this time was a disaster. After 2 hours, they called and told me that my arm control was broken while it is still normal when driving. The Mercedes arm control is very strong unless you hit something hard.  Cost 1K to replace the arm control and brake sensor for no reason. Never comeback.< /Text>

A solid shop for alignments if you have the membership. The staff is friendly,  but I constantly wait upwards of 3-4 hours when being told it would take an hour or less.<//review>

< Review>
Great service. Sales Advisor - Alan, visually  explained me everything about how a tire rotation and wheel alignment works. I went for a lifetime wheel alignment service. He even took me at the back where cars were repaired to show me live working on cars. Offered me a discount and inspected wheels, tires and brakes without me asking. The mechanic did a great job as well. Overall the service was great.</Review>

Frustrated and disappointed!!  I went to this shop before to replaced all my tires with no problem but this time I just had frustration and disappointed.  I had all my tires replaced and did alignment on my car recently.  The next day, I had my car regular serviced at the Toyota manufacturer but forgot to informed the service manager not to do the tires because I just had them done.  I got called by car manufacturer service dept that they cannot crack loose the keys lugnut on the tires and that they broke 2 of their keys trying to loosen them so they can start rotate the tires.  I told them not to do it and  I'll have Wheel Work check it out. When I went back to this Wheel Work, all they blame the manufacturer service dep.   And they told me  I should purchase new key because the key that I have is damaged. I purchase a new lock key for the tires.  Wheel Works tried on all 4 tires and eventually damaged the key I just purchase but cannot crack loose any key lugnut.  Then they informed me that I should have bought the set key instead of the key only.  So arguments went back and forth because they did not tell me about buying the entire set earlier.  I had no choice but to purchase the set.  Eventually they had to break off the bolts for the key lock on all tires and install the new set I purchased.  So its only fair to conclude that when they install the tires, they cross-threaded the bolts on the keylocks on all 4 tires which explains why they had to break off the bolts.  Although I was not charge for the labor,  I will never go to this shop again.  Too much head-aches and too risky.  Workmanship is questionable.<//text>

Sales Rep was very professional and after looking at my tires  somehow figured out that I bought them from Costco .
He said I can get my puncture done for free from Costco.
I did not want to go to costco so he honored my decision and fixed the puncture with a reasonable quote of $20 and with in 20 minutes
Very pleasant experience< /Review>

< Review>
I ask how many Wheel Work Techs does it take to balance and rotate tires efficiently??? I get the call my car is ready. However my tire setting was not updated after the job and no one knew how to do it.  So I figured I’d go to the other Wheel works off King Rd. Which is down the street from them to set up. Do you think they fixed the problem? NO. My tire setting is still flashing after I was told drive 15 minutes and it’ll set. And get this while I was at the one off King, they noticed that the original wheel works off Capitol who did the job to begin with had rotated the tires but didn’t check the pressure and all my tires were off because my cars recommendations are front requires less pressure than the back. Where is the work ethic and the experience necessary to do the job that could potentially cause accident or worse death???< /Review>

< Review>
Extremely poor customer service. I've ordered more than 20K worth of tiles from them this year and can tell you the experience has been horrible. You need to get the order right to the sq feet or you are in for serious pain. They will not pick up phone, voice mail boxes are full, will not respond to emails either. In case you get to the customer service, first thing they will make you realize is they are doing a favor by helping you. For one of my order I was short some tile, they have to get from LA. for a $136 item. (3 boxes) they send me a $300 shipping charge and no guarantee on delivery date. For next order I ordered a little extra to not have to go through the pain and was told I can return as it was in stock item. When I called to return first answer was cannot be returned. After reminding them, they are charging 20% restocking fees. Wow! So first you pay higher costs, then they rip you off both ways with return or extra order. All this while showing they are doing a favor. Have all receipts, communications if the shop cares, even complained with their corporate. My review is for the San Jose shop which is miserable. Yes they have some good designs but you can get very similar ones in the shops in that area. My suggestion stay away from this place.

Update: Store manager reached out to me and took care of the situation. He was extremely polite and considerate and had the material I needed shipped fast from LA. Gave credit for shipping too. All in all, I appreciate how he cared to take care of customer and went above and beyond to help. Acknowledged that he has been trying to change the store culture and I sure hope he is successful in it.</Review>

<time>1605543473334</time><text>It truly saddens me to read some of the negative reviews on the Customer Service at Porcelanosa. I worked at the San Jose location many moons ago. I was with the company at it's first location as well as this location. Of course there were different Managers and a different CEO. What I can tell you is we never had negative reviews. Anyone would tell you every aspect of Porcelanosa was brilliant. It was a pleasure working with this company. In fact, it was probably one of my favorite jobs in my 20's. I have moved to L. A. Area and am remodeling my home. Of course I am using Porcelanosa in my kitchen and baths. Bottom line, I hope some of the negative reviews on customer service does not detour you away from purchasing Porcelanosa tile, stone as well as the System Pool and Gamma Decor. I assure you, you will enjoy the elegance and beauty for many years. See if maybe you can talk to another rep at a different location about any questions you may have on a particular product and then order from San Jose to avoid any shipping charges. At least until they sort out the C. S. Issue. Maybe starting with management. This particular location used to be so organized and accurate I hope things get back to the way it was. Sorry for the rant.</text>< UserId.>

Adding another on the TERRIBLE customer service. The staff at the showroom have little to no energy to help prospective customers and act like answering a question is such a burden. We waited a half hour to get someone to help, at which point they rudely gave answers to pricing and style questions as if "it is what it is". Either they had no knowledge of their own products and some similar or more flexible alternatives in terms of price, or they did not want to make an OUNCE of EFFORT. We gave up and decided to research through the site, and found some great alternatives. I'm appalled that for the obscene prices here, that they cannot find more professional or friendly salespeople.< /text>

<Text>We were visiting San Jose and are doing a remodel back home. We were going to order from Porcelanosa but thought we should walk in quickly and see things in person. From the moment we walked in the door, we had a wonderful experience.
We were customers of JP and he was fantastic. He answered all of our questions and was able to follow us bouncing ideas off one another. We never felt pressured. Like I said, we didn't have a lot of time in San Jose and we were able to complete our order to our satisfaction with JP. We really appreciate him going above and beyond to find us a shower column and staying in touch regarding shipping costs. This is how easy and breezy remodeling should be!</Text>< UserId.>

<Time>1565130810662</Time><review>Great showroom - Yes. Great selection - Yes. Customer service - ZERO starts.  We were doing a whole house remodel. Purchased floor tiles, wall tiles, vanities and bathtub. Bath tub has internal damage - took almost a month to just file a claim - and that is after a full month of calling and sending emails into nowhere. Then the sales associate goes on maternity leave, and does not update us nor the replacement sales associate on status of the claim. After countless calls and emails - again into nowhere, I go into the store, and get re-assured that the replacement sales associate will follow up and get back to me by end of the following day - it is now two months after the initial defect complaint. Guess what??? its been a week and a half since he said he will call and update - and there is no call. Again called... again emailed... unable to get ANYONE on the phone. Not something you expect from a such an upscale company for the amount of money they charge for their product.</review>< Pics>

We have worked with Porcelanosa for 2 major bathroom renovations in the last two years and both times the experience hadn't been great. Last year most of tiles arrived broken after waiting for their delivery for almost a month. They have been packed worse than Amazon would pack a toilet paper - just with a tape, no protection at all. One would say it is a problem of delivery company, which is fair, however when we had tried to get reimbursed, our sales manager - Alesia Tom - said that is exactly why we should have ordered even more tiles [read 100% more] to factor such events (price - $12.95/ sq. ft). It took several escalations and long investigation to get our money back.

In the summer 2019 we have ordered another large set of tiles and it took around 2 months to arrive (vs. promised 3-4 weeks), as they had some system issues. The last drop was when we came to buy tile trims to the store and the same rude sales manager that served us last year - Alesia - did not want to let me use one of the two empty chairs in front of her desk, when I was sitting on my knees nearby for a long time, while being served by someone else. After I insisted, she said I can “borrow” it till she gets new clients. Unfortunately, she has no notion of basic customer service principles and even politeness. I had to explain that all customers in this store are equal and no one deserves to sit almost on the floor, especially while she is not serving anyone. I am surprised she is still allowed to be working in a sales role with such demeanor.

We had a good experience only by interacting with Jason Silveria - their local designer, who was nice, responsive and actually helpful to plan the complex tiles layout. This together with stylish tile design brings the score up to a 2/5 , otherwise I would give a zero.<//Text>

Gets your imagination going and can lead you to some design decisions.  Pricing on most inventory is only friendly to high-end clients and homes, if you have to ask how much; you probably can't afford it.

I recommend a visit so you can see what you are missing in your dream home.  At the very least you'll leave with some inspiration.</Review><rating>3<//rating><user>110672670442117280532</user><Date>1479255082812</Date></record>

<Text>The quality is fine but not worth the crazy price. I can find equally beautiful tiles in Bedrosians. The only advantage Porcelanosa has is a more beautiful showroom. We bought some tiles from them when they were having 40% off and still came out more expensive than other stores. Also, the other comments that mentioned understaffed employees can't be more accurate. We walked around the showroom for 15min without anyone even care to notice us. We visited another store nearby hoping when we came back there would be someone available to help us but later realized that's pure daydreaming. Eventually a lady helped us order some tiles after another ~20min wandering around the showroom.

Then, after we installed the tiles, we found we need some more. So I called them and of course the 40% off price is gone (I was able to get sale price from my floor company (35% off) months after my purchase). I asked if I can pick it up the same day the lady said nope. Day after? Lady said probably but I should call them before coming. Hey, ALL other stores give ME a call when product is ready for pickup, even Home Depot. Obviously they think they are better than everyone else, even their customers. Stay away!</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1519740731838, 'text': 'Hi Huida,\nThank you for sharing your feedback on your recent visit to our showroom.

Warehouse staff is very incompetent. Waiting time is terrible. They warehouse encourages delivery (Additional charge) and not pick-ups. They are not contractor friendly, so if you need just one more box of tiles, plan on killing half a day waiting. I don’t advise my customers to shop there at all.<//Text>

This place has beautiful tiles. Great design and selection. However some of the associates don't know how to use their internal ordering system and they kept messing up my orders.

We've had only experiences with Porcelanosa.  The saleswoman we've worked with, Mayra Rios, has been terrific: helpful, creative, not pushy; follows through, offers what's on-sale.  The company has delivered precisely as promised; at each step, has dealt with us fairly.  No doubt: we'll be back there again... before AND after our other favorite: Bullnose Tile.<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Porcelanosa has good tiles but they lack any sort of Customer Support. I made a very big order from Porcelanosa in San Jose and every single tile arrived to my house entirely broken. I contacted their customer representative and had to re-purchase new tiles.

They charged me for the new tiles and never reimbursed the old tiles. Several weeks have passed and the customer representative wouldn't answer my phone calls and I had to drive twice from San Mateo to San Jose to ask about the status of my refund. I was told that they are waiting for the refund from their shipping company before they can proceed with the refund to me. This is totally unacceptable for someone who spent several thousand dollars to purchase tiles and almost 200 dollars for shipping. Also, it is impossible to talk to managers because the customer rep wouldn't give me the contact of someone above her.

Awful experience, I am continuing to ask for the refund and I will keep everyone posted.

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>They have great products. I remodeled both of my bathrooms to go for a more modern look and they turned out great using the tile, sink and shower fixtures from here. As someone else said, they are not cheap at all and I got a great sale on all of my items, but it looks beautiful. You do have to wait sometimes when you go in the showroom for help and sometimes the follow-up in the San Francisco store is a little slow. The biggest drawback are the shiiping charges if its not a stocked item, these can add up quickly. Also, you cannot pickup items the same day which is another hassle.</Review>< Date>

<text>The product itself is fairly good. But the service is terrible. I ordered a vanity, faucet and some tiles last month and the sales person promised it would be delivered within 3 weeks. However, things just went behind the schedule. It arrived more than one week later so I had to postpone with my contractor to begin the bathroom remodel project. What made me really angry is how the loading guy did his job. His (his name pronounces as El ) first words to me was "park your car quickly. we have a lot of customers and I am the only person to do the loading, I need to get lunch now". When I am struggling to put the back seats in my SUV down, I asked his help. However, his reply was "no, I am not supposed to do that". Then he just left the package on the ground and disappeared. At that moment, I have no choice but to resort to store manager. The manager handled this professionally and seems cooperative, but I don't know why he hired such a loading person that never matches the brand name in the first place. I just feel unfair to get such a "service" when I spent nearly three thousands of dollars on this store.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

When i ordered tile - they didnt think to sell me bullnose for the edges so i had to special order it at an added cost.  When i ordered flooring they didnt think to sell me tee strip transitions so again had to special order it.  When i needed grout "sorry but you have to come back tomorrow"  They provide no expertise with ordering or the material selection and very poor customer service.  .there are much better tile and flooring providers  in the same area shop  and i will buy elsewhere from now on.</text>

This is the spot to get your car replenished to its brand new state that it was the day you bought it.  I Always leave this place with a mile wide smile! Great atmosphere, and even greater customer service, if your not getting your car washed here your really not good to your car.</Review>

Can't believe the lack of reviews this spot has with so many people coming in.

First of, customer service is amazing - friendly, courteous, attentive.

Second, work ethic is at its best. Attentive to detail, the employee working on my vehicle took the time to do a well satisfactory job - interior and exterior.

Lastly, prices are fair. Various options depending on what you're looking for.

I will definitely come back to get a detail.

Thank you all.<//Review>

<Date>1621697797731<//Date><Rating>5< /Rating><text>2001 Honda Civic overheated, I had my car towed to Automotive Excellence. The staff was completely professional from the time my car arrived on the scene.  Open communication, I felt a sense of honesty, time lines given were met, I was given a detailed diagnosis and didn't feel pressured.  Radiator failed, caused other parts to overheat, also an oil leak was noted.  Automotive Excellence sent out warped parts for repair and had me back on the road STAT.  I'm so grateful, my car is my lively hood and now it sounds and rides better than before my experience at Automotive Excellence Seal Beach.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkb34zEIGu5rgAzgKtcDHSv5O_MSPTsHmWerEr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I use automotive excellence on all 4 of are families cars. My son and daughter also use them. They always do a great job, their both professional and friendly. They do a quality job at a fair price. I would highly recommend them.

I actually ended up using automotive excellence because of the recommendation of a friend who had a good experience with them. My check engine light came on and they  extremely helpful. Answered all of my questions and explained to me everything that was going on with my car. Will definitely be returning to them.<//Review>

We have been taking our cars here for years and it’s always a great experience! They have taken great care of my old Honda Accord and always go the extra mile. All of the interactions I’ve had here have been very positive and professional. I highly recommend Automotive Excellence!</Text>

<Text>Brought my kia soul in to be diagnosed by Automotive Excellence.. I got a speedy anwser to my automobiles problems.. They also use an app to show you damaged parts and common wear on your car as well.. The mechanics and staff all greet you with a smile and ask if the can help you. The repair prices are always low and affordable. This is now my third car that I have brought to Automotive Excellence, because honesty and trust are shown at this buisness.. I recommend them to everybody...< /Text>< Pics>

Raul one of the employees suggested me take my car here bc I always ask him questions while I’m at work. I finally brought it by because my check engine light was on.. the services I received were an oil change and just checking the maintenance on my car to make sure everything was ok. As a female they didn’t make me feel belittled bc I didn’t know much about my car, they explained everything and I felt they had my best interest in mind. The guys are really nice. The tow truck driver Aaron gave me a ride to work that morning and we even shared a few laughs. My car is up and running like it should be. I was happy with the price and I was more than happy with the service. Thanks so much see you guys again!</review>

Honest, professional and courteous! There aren't enough stars on Yelp to give this business. Andrew assisted me and he went above and beyond answering questions that I had about my car as well as a few that didn't pertain to issues they were fixing. It was a Monday and I know they were busy but he never made me feel that it was a bother. One question was concerning a leak I was told I had by another shop that was over $1,000. Andrew had it looked at then called me and told me I didn't have a leak! To sum it up, if you need your car fixed this is the place to go!
Thank you again Andrew and Automotive Excellence!</review>

<Text>So initially they gave an estimate to my little sister for $653 for a new starter. The part & labor. I knew she was being overcharged because I've had my starter replaced & we have the same car. The 1st place we called was $200 cheaper. We wound up finding the part & labor somewhere else . (won't name because I don't want it to seem like I'm endorsing them) for over $300 cheaper with a warranty for the starter. On top of trying to overcharge her they then tried to hold her car hostage unless she paid a $70 diagnostic fee. I knew it was the starter before it even went in because of how it clicked when you turn the key. Only when I called the police they waived the fee. They are Endorsed by AAA & so their driver was the one assigned to tow her car to the new place. Then they tried to say they couldn't tow the car to the other garage because the tags were expired even though AAA towed it there with expired tags to begin with. She told them they weren't expired, just not on yet & Peter said "If I run the plates they'll come back valid?" As if he could actually have had the plates ran?! Just trying to intimidate her. Pathetic excuse of a human being trying to trick a kid like that.  Bottom line is they are crooks and if you're a woman, avoid them like the plague because they will try to finesse the hell out of you.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dd2ffab39ccbad:0xc7e141cbbe6faf3e</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Having an older BMW they have seen me often and have always been honest and made time to explain the repairs and costs to me. I love them!</Review>

They were professional, completely forthcoming and honest, communication was like I was talking to a good friend, and not only did they fix my jeep they've changed my perspective on mechanics forever!!

<Review>Automotive Excellence has earned my business for life.  We had a minor mishap with a tow call-out.  From the moment I reached out to Andrew and Peter, they were working hard to resolve the issue.  They assisted with making arrangements for pick-up of my car and had completed the necessary repairs within 24 hours.  I certainly value their timeliness, but more than anything else their professionalism and commitment to making things right.  OUTSTANDING team!

We have been taking all of our vehicles to Automotive Excellence for over 10+ years and will never take our business elsewhere. Family owned and operated with a consistent level of trust that you cannot find anywhere else.

Andrew & Peter have always taken great care of us and never try to push any unnecessary services on us. In fact, they have always given us the most cost effective solutions for any issues that arise.

Trustworthy, Family owned, and consistently exceed our expectations with their service levels.< /Review>

Andrew and associates are the best at what they do, the customer service element is on point (they strive to make the customer happy) and they are very honest.  After years of being "taken" by one automotive shop after another, I feel so lucky to have received a referral from a trusted friend about Automobile Excellence.  I can finally rest easy!<//review>< pictures>

<Response>None</Response><Text>I received the “CV19 concierge service”  this past week.  They picked up my Ford and performed routine 100k mileage service.  Also there was a noise coming from my AC and they found a paper in glove box stuck in vent.  In addition, last year a minor leak in AC hose was found,, but labor to get to hose and fix was quite expensive and I declined.  This year they found a bypass fix kit and performed and serviced AC on my 2005. Automotive Excellence returned car to my home after service, even wiping interior down.   Can’t thank them enough for this and the years of excellent service on all my cars.< /Text>< user_name>

As always, service was excellent.  Analysis of the issue was quick, parts and labor were quoted and quite reasonable and they finished earlier than estimated.  I've always had great luck with AE, various vehicles over the years.<//Text>

< review>
I just had a tire repair done here. and the young man that ended up helping me was polite and swift with the simple tire repair, so that was greatly appreciated. Unfortunately, there is a rude snappy manager that initially helped me that has THE WORST condescending attitude. When I told him why I was there, and had made an appointment the day before, he snaps back with "Well I wouldn't know that, I wasn't here yesterday". I was shocked at the frustrated response, and I am FAR from a sensitive person!

I wish I would have gotten his name, but I just wanted to escape the small space where his big mouth was running very LOUDLY. I feel bad for the other workers that were there behind him with looks of horror on their faces. So many stellar reviews for this shop, which is what brought me in, but that was my first and last time.</review>

I appreciate the honesty, integrity, and workmanship of Automotive Excellence. I no longer take my car to the dealership- I have all my services and repairs completed here! Excellent service, trustworthy, & won’t recommend or perform service/repairs you do not need. Everyone is very positive and kind on top of it all.< /text>

These guys are phenomenal! Hometown feel in the always busy SoCal region. All class. I service my truck quite a bit; they are very responsive and always accommodate my crazy work schedule. I’ve used others in area before finding Automotive Excellence but non compare!! Give these guys a try.< /Review>

I was looking for a quality mom & pop auto repair shop where I can establish a relationship. Walking through the doors here, you don't feel very welcomed. In fact, they don't feel much different than a dealer. You talk to a "service advisor," and never interface with the mechanic. I am actually OK with that, but they charge (overcharge) on their prices. They wanted $350 to change my transmission oil. I called the dealer and they only wanted $140. I asked to go to the bathroom, and they acted as if I wanted to rob their shop. If that's the case, I'll just go to a dealer.</review>

This is a busy, professional shop, but the owner took time to explain the various repair options then helped me decide whitch was most suitable for my situation. And, as I was “on the road”, squeezed me in to an already busy weekend. Good work, good crew, good price.1000 miles later car’s purring like a kitten and I’m happy as a clam. Will definitely return and recommend.<//Text>

They might be good at what they do, but don't rate very high on ethics.  I had a dead battery and was told one would be brought to me. Then the driver didn't have a battery, but told me they had one at the shop. He jump started my car and brought me home after I drove it to their place.  This was followed by a call saying they would have to order a battery and couldn't install it until the next day. The installation was surprisingly expensive because they had to "reset the door locks and things", which apparently didn't include the clock. They were very smooth and I've had too much to deal with lately to be at my best.  I didn't even think, and no one suggested, that the old battery could have been recharged.< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>Automotive Excellence is true to its name. By far, it is the best automotive shop I have ever visited.  The employees are honest, responsive and consistently professional.  On many occasions, they have pointed out ways that I can save money and seem to always be fair and consistent in their pricing and recommendations.  They also follow up after each service to ensure that I am happy and to answer any questions.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Another great thing about living in Seal Beach: Automotive Excellence! Maintenances and repairs they’ve done on my 2005 Subaru have always been top notch. Customer service just got even better with state of the art capability to send text/email updates with graphics, photos and video on findings as work progresses. 💯 confidence in this business!</text>

<Review>I had recently purchased a used Avalon that would shutter so bad at traffic stops, I had to put it in neutral then shift back into gear when the light turned green. I am very busy, and had dropped the car several places to get have the issue diagnosed. Mechanics at other chain stores,  gave me sheet after sheet of issues costing more than I had paid for the car. I had some work to do in Seal Beach, and decided to drop my car at Automotive Excellence. Peter came out, looked at the car, and I explained the shuttering. He said they would look at it, and get back to me. Peter called me back that afternoon and told me it was a timing issue caused by a faulty switch. They fixed the issue and had it back to me the next day. It was almost half the price of what everyone else had quoted me. It was a great experience, the car is running great, and I will definitely be taking my car back to the Team at Automotive Excellence.<//Review><date>1535388068807<//date>< gmap_id>

Always a great experience, even when your car is broken.  Peter and Andrew always make sure they cover everything up front. The work is always timely and clean.  One time we had a repair done on our truck and the part they put in stopped working after a couple of months and they replaced right away no charge.  They have done repair and maintenance on 4 of our cars and have never disappointed us.  Excellent business, run by excellent people.</text>

I needed a repair for my front bumper.  I went there because a colleague told me he takes his car there.  They couldn't do the repair themselves but they they took it to a body shop for me and arranged everything with the body shop.  That was very helpful because all the work was done while I was on vacation and it was nearly ready when I got home.  The repair was perfect.< /text>

Had to use my AAA membership for the first time tonight, and this company was the closest AAA service. I received a text stating when they'd arrive. He (I think his name was William) showed up earlier than expected, discovered that my battery needed replaced, had a replacement in his truck, and the cost was very reasonable. And...he finished the job BEFORE the ETA of arrival!! This was by far thee best service I've experienced in many years. Thank you Automotive Excellence, for living up to your name!!<//Text>

This garage was extremely helpful when I was trying to get my older car to pass smog last year. I had several local garages quote me a very low fee just to get me in the door for the smog certificate. Automotive Excellence told me up front what I was going to need to complete the registration and simply pass smog. I actually saved several hundred dollars and a whole bunch of time.  The customer service at the desk is fantastic when you walk in the door as well. They have a good team across the board at Automotive Excellence of Seal Beach.<//Text>

We have been bringing our cars to Automotive Excellence for years now. Andrew is super helpful and trustworthy. When I was purchasing a new car and was presented with an optional (and very expensive service plan), I called Andrew and asked him for his opinion. He gave me the low down and I was able to make an informed decision.

We get everything done here. From oil changes to new tires. No body work though.

I was there recently waiting for my new battery to be installed when I saw an elderly Asian couple get dropped off by the tow truck. Their car wasn’t drivable and they needed a ride home. They could barely speak English and it was obvious they didn’t have a clue about Uber. Automotive Excellence arranged an Uber for them and they were on their way. That helpfulness really made an impression on me.

We will continue to take our vehicles to Automotive Excellence.</review>

There service lot in front is always full, which is an indicator of how many clients they have. They provide a AAA tow service, but the tow service does not try to push you to them. I used them cause my nearest gas station repair facility had a bad reputation for ripping off seniors living in the adjacent retirement community of Leisure World.

Pete and the entire team at Automotive Excellence are truly awesome!  I purchased larger off-road tires for my '06 Xterra and took it to Automotive Excellence  to have them road-force balanced.  Not only were their prices totally affordable, they did it in less time than what they had quoted me.  My truck rides so much better now!  Thank you AE!!!<//review>

Automotive Excellence is absolutely the BEST!! I had battery problems in Jan. My friend had referred me to them. Peter had my car in the same day and everything was fixed. YEAH!! In Sep, the battery went dead.  I called Automotive Excellence & spoke to Jonathon. My son brought the battery in & they tested it. They found out the battery was defective. Peter & Jonathon replaced it immediately!! What a relief!! Talk about what an Honorable & Customer oriented business to have the pleasure of giving my business to.  GREAT PEOPLE!!! And they owner, Andrew, even followed up with me, to make sure everything was running good.  I give Automtive Excellence a 10+... they are TRUELY EXCELLENT!!! Thanks guys!!! Now, I refer my friends to them!!< /review>

<review>"Knowledgeable mechanics & service managers"

My F-150 truck was due for a service check up at 117K and while I've done most of my own automotive work on my cars and truck, I decided I would let them take care of it. They had previously worked on the truck and I was very satisfied and this was the real reason why I took my vehicle to them. While it was not a cheap ticket, I realized that it was time that I needed to put some money into the vehicle and I had a fair idea of what needed to be done. The entire front suspension needed replacing, as well as new brakes and serpentine belt. The truck rides better. They listened to me and my concerns and they explained the work that needed to be done. At this point in my life I'm ready to let others do the heavy lifting and I have confidence in the service they performed. I'm convinced they stand behind their work. They will get my business in the future< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

They've rescued me many times for locking my keys in my car (I'm famous for it) and even though they don't work on oldie cars, they are good enough to change the oil and look after me! ...

They charge way too much, almost double the price than other repair shops.

They took advantage of my elderly grandmother and charged her $25 for a "brake check". Me and my husband stood by on the other side of the street and saw them go around the block in my grandmas car "testing the brakes". Are you kidding me??? What the h*ll??

My mothers car has loose motor mounts. She took her car here to get an estimate, and they said it would cost $2000 to fix it! My mom thought that didnt sound right, so she took it to another repair shop and they said they would charge $900 to fix it.

Absolutely unbelievable.  My family has a history with them, and multiple times they have said there was a problem with the car when there never was a problem there in the first place...and that is a HUGE RED FLAG.

Do not give your money to these scumbags! Take it to a repair shop that respects their customers!
I will be reporting this place, hopefully a lawsuit comes their way soon.<//review></record>

I'll start out by saying, I'm a huge car enthusiast and usually do all my own work. However, I got a nail in the left front tire of my Subaru Outback and didn't have time to fix it myself. I had never been to Automotive Excellence before, but drove in and they installed a tire plug immediately! First class service and a good attitude. Thank you much! Will be back if I need something again for my vehicles. Cheers!<//text>

<Review>I took my car in for an oil change and was told I needed $1,400 of necessary repairs. At any other repair shop in my life I would have panicked that I was being ripped off. But my long-term experience with Automotive Excellence, the best repair place I have ever known, resulted in my not worrying for a moment. Instead, I felt only gratitude they had found needed repairs and would complete them at a fair price. You can't do better than Automotive Excellence. You really can't.

We had problems with our car three days before having to transport my daughter, son-in-law and their two daughters (2 1/2 and 2 months old) to LAX so they could fly back to Washington D.C.  Even though they were very busy they understood our problem and helped us out.  Can anything be better than a local business helping out a local in trouble.  I have used them before when there was not a time restraint and they took just as much care with my problems.</Review>

Nothing is worse than being away from home and requiring car repair. When I called in the the morning, they told me to bring my car by, the earlier the better. I dropped it off by 8:30ish and by 12:00 they were calling me back to pick it up, having diagnosed and fixed it for under $200. One less worry! Thanks.< /Text>

Automotive Excellence has outstanding customer service.  On more than one occasion when I drove in  to their shop without an appointment and needed immediate assistance (ie. Low on oil).  They not only checked the oil,  they  set up appointment for an oil change at a convient time, and  added two quarts of oil. They did not charge me a dime.  Compare that with the Volkswagen dealship I went to for years.  I pull in  and tell them I am low on oil...the  mechanic told me the parts department is around the corner.   The service is far superior to any automotive repair shop I have used in the last 50 years.  You can trust they will do the right thing.</text>

AAA battery service center. NOT RECOMMENDED by Client

Upon arriving I was excited to see a busy location, that must mean good things right? Boy were we disappointed. We were Referred  to this location by AAA for a battery to be replaced under warranty.

Drove from Bixby Knolls to Seal Beach on Sunday to get my battery replaced. The gentlemen that tried to assist me was not friendly at all. He was rather dismissive about by issue. The battery  was covered by AAA 3 year warranty service but this location DID NOT HELP ME with this issue. In the end I had to get a jump start again before driving off to look for another AAA location that would assist  with my issue.

This location did not help me and I CANNOT  RECOMMEND them.< /text>

<rate>4</rate><Review>This place is nice to have amazing indoor water view and very spacious outdoor tent with live music on Sunday brunch day. Food was great. Service was great and quick. The only thing I would say for me making reservations was of no point. We still have to wait and did not get the seating that I requested. One table was empty indoor with water view and they end up giving to people who did not had reservations and might be waiting prior to us. So I would say May be walk in us better.< /Review>< pics>

If you want good food, great drinks, and AMAZING staff. Sol is definitely the place to go!
We were in town from Texas and my niece chose this place for us.
We asked for water front seating, and were seated in JC’s section! Talk about an great, attentive and entertaining service. He will be our server of choice everytime!

He is COVID safe, but still friendly and super helpful! If we would have had another server the entire experience would not have been what I was hoping for. Thanks so much JC for EVERYTHING! We love you and we will be back in March with the whole Family!<//text>

Cool view of the water and boats from inside the restaurant. Service was excellent. The food was very delicious. The corn was average but still good.</review>

The drinks were made with fresh squeezed juices. The salsa and bean dip were yummy and fresh chips. I got the naked chicken burrito (basically a chicken bowl) it was very good! My friend got the carnitas street tacos and ate every single bite. We were sat at a booth with a view of the water which was lovely. It's a little pricey, but then again this is high end Mexican on the water.< /text>

Service visit not frequently, kept on brining our main course as appetizer for one person early twice. I strongly suggest not going here!< /text>< pics>

What a disappointment.. Where do I begin. I used to frequent Sol on weekly basis prior to the pandemic and loved the ambiance on the patio. So many birthdays, graduations, and holidays alike spent there. The customer service was always top notch and view was unbeatable. When I was thinking where to plan for my bridal rehearsal, naturally Sol came up as no brainer.  Tonight I called in to make a reservation 2 months in advance to lock in a patio table for my BRIDAL PARTY of 5....and this is what I received. I first speak with the host and she informs me that no parties over 4 are allowed on the patio ?????? Umm, can you not just push two tables together or add an extra chair ?? I've worked in the hospitality industry in the past for years and never was it acceptable to immediately respond to a guest with an automatic NO. Rather lead as solution oriented..

Then I proceeded to talk with the Manager John and it got worse. John piggy-backed off the host and mentioned he will put in a "Request" for a table but "no guarantees". Mind you were calling in to make a small reservation for a bridal party of 5 in 2 months from now...

Thank you so much John for your "warm hospitality" and "strong customer service", it is very well received ! I'll be sure to spread the word about this enchanting experience to all my friends and beyond. Good luck< /Text>

<text>Food is decent and strong drinks. But be advised you might have to wait longer if going with larger groups. We had a reservation at 8pm which we got the table at 9.15pm. The hostess ignored us till the end. The service starts to not live upto the standard as you approach the closing time.

But don’t want to take credit from the food and drinks. Desserts could improve.</text>< Gmap_id>

Food is unimaginative . Beautiful view of water so 2 stars but food seemed bland . I had fish torta which was not enjoyable.  The Spanish rice had no flavor, chewy and greasy.  Too much sauce on the food too makes it soggy</review>

I’m only giving this one star because the workers were nice. Other than that, food was gross, unseasoned, and overpriced. I had a better chance going to Del Taco than this place. Will not return ever again.< /text>

< Review>
Been here a few times and this past time was not so great. Restaurant looked busy, many staff memebers but server was not on her A game. Ordered a drink when dinner arrived and didnt get it till after we finished dinner. Manager did comp one of our 4 margaritas we got without asking for it to be comped which was nice of them. A lot of food runners but wait staff looked understaffed. Food was ok my finance's tacos (pictured) were plain and not worth 17 dollars. Rice was dry and no flavor. Not worth the money, might give it a try again at another date in the distant future.</Review>

<Text>A bit pricey but what do you expect from a nice restaurant on the harbor. The service was excellent. JC was our waiter, he took very good care of us. He deserves five stars.</Text>< pics>

<text>What was the name of restaurant(s) that  were at this location before it was SOL?  For years I use to go and watch the Christmas boat parade from the grand viewing dining room. I’d like to do it again, this time Mexican fare  post all of  the COVID MALARKEY!  I just can’t for the life of me recall the restaurants prior name(s)?

Anyone, Buhler..., anyone?< /text>< response>

<Rate>3</Rate><Review>I will preface this by saying I have only had great experiences at SOL before the incident I’m reviewing on... hence the 3 stars.
Throughout COVID, SOL has been great as they’ve stayed open with an awesome outdoor dining setup (lots of heaters, great ambiance, etc.) but since California reopened indoor dining, that has all gone away.
I made a reservation a week in advance for a party of 7 for my boyfriend’s birthday. We requested indoor seating because we had older people in our party who don’t do well in the cold - they told us they could not make a note in the system but that if we showed up early we should have no problem sitting indoors but if we absolutely have to sit outside there will be plenty of heaters.
We arrived 15 minutes early and were told we could not sit inside unless we wanted to wait an extra hour, no big deal. We decided to try and sit outside and the host told us we will be able to have plenty of heaters. The second we were seated we found out this wasn’t the case. Every party sitting outside was bundled up in blankets and we were only offered one (basically single person) heater. We asked to get at least one more and were told that was not possible even though I had been recently and almost every person in the party was able to have a heater. It took a very long time to even get a response about the heaters from the manager and ended up leaving because of the experience.
I had never been to SOL pre-COVID, so I’m not sure if this was a one-off experience, but normally the food, drinks, and service are excellent. Unfortunately, we will definitely be hesitant to return.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
To celebrate Mexican Independence Day, my wife and I decided to have Mexican food for dinner. Originally we were thinking about hitting one of the chain Mexican restaurants near us. But decided to go to Sol Mexican restaurant for this special occasion.

We’re familiar with the Sol establishment. We frequent the Playa Vista location and we love their food. Since we want to visit Balboa Island during the day, we decided to have dinner at the Newport location afterward.

The food here didn’t disappoint us. They are just as good the food as in the Playa Vista location. I always have their Mexican street for appetizer. This corn is delicious which’s full of flavor and grill taste.

For the main dishes, my wife had their quesadilla with chicken and I ordered their fish taco and Vampiro. The Taco Vampiro came with double tortilla stuffed with melted cheese, serrano chiles & scallions, with carne asada, guacamole & pico de gallo, chipotle sauce & cotixa. All these ingredients made the taco tasted fantastic. The fish taco was just as good. I devoured both tacos in no time.

During Covid-19, the restaurant has a large out door tent for outside seatings. All waiters wear masks and glove. All guests have to check in outside of the restaurant before been seated.

<Review>This recent visit wasn't as good as my previous. Luis our Server was Awesome and took great care of our dinner party in celebration of my niece's 21st birthday. The food quality this visit definitely wasn't as I remember. I had the Shrimp Taquitos (starter) - El Jefe Tacos (Filet & Shrimp)  and a few Cervezas. The Taquitos were decent - I shared those with my 4 yr old son - He loved them - Although they were Ok to me ... Something was different about the El Jefe Tacos though - 1st I remember them being more expensive and thought it was due to the Filet Mignon and the Jumbo Prawns - This trip they appeared to be made with NY Strip and regular shrimp. Then the overall quality was just Ok - Steak was a bit chewy - Shrimp were slightly overcooked. The brews were of course Ice Cold as they should be but I had expectations of a visit as quality as my previous and was slightly disappointed ... Maybe next time will be better .<//Review>< username>

<review>I love that they serve beans with the salsa a yummy greeting that kicks off the experience was able to get a table the first time I came but I recommend reservations especially with a big party to avoid a wait. The octopus was my favorite most memorable plate. The fish tacos are also very delicious. They have a super boujee margarita made with clase azul with costs like $30 too expensive for me but I think it’s a cool treat they offer for birthdays and special occasions. I have been here like 3x this month great spot.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Amazing service and amazing food! The bus boys and the servers are especially dedicated to customer service and ensuring your food is the best it could be! Outdoor seating is amazing both in the harbour side and the new set ups in the parking lot. Whole family loved it all and so did the kids! :)))< /Text>

<review>Subpar Mexican food at its best. Lackluster margaritas. Mediocre entrees. Decent chips, salsa, and beans. Much better options in Orange County at this price point. I wouldn’t go out of your way searching for good Mexican food and land on this place.< /review>< Time>

Absolutely amazing restaurant. The food was of highest quality and everything tasted very good. The highlight for me was the corn that they serve and will carve onto your plate for you. I would go here more often if I lived in this area.<//Text>

< Review>
The staff lied numerous to my party while trying to enjoy a meal. I went to this restaurant for brunch on the weekend because I called and specifically asked if they had bottomless mimosas and was told they did ONLY to find out they didn’t when we were seated. Not happy to find this out once seated. The manger literally would not come to our table to speak to us about honoring this. We felt cheated and belittled. The manger was too good to speak to us. I have never been treated like this at a restaurant. I’ve had better service at Del taco</Review>

<user_name>Erika Paige< /user_name><Date>1546536979553<//Date><Rating>4< /Rating><text>It is a bit pricey for Mexican food ($10 for guacamole), but absolutely worth the splurge! I’ve been 4 times and never been disappointed. The food is fresh and seasoned to perfection.

The black bean dip that comes with the chips is so delicious. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Street Taco. My fiancé ordered the Mango Chilé Salad and added chicken. He was a little sad because he thought the mango would be fresh, not dried. It was still delicious, but next time he orders it he will get it without the mango. We had plenty of food left over to take home for another meal.

If you have a cilantro sensitivity check the menu before deciding to eat here. Many of the dishes include cilantro that cannot be removed. My mom does not like cilantro and found the menu options limiting.

The location is ideal, many restaurants in the area claim to be water front, but are not. Sol actually is along the harbor. They have a covered patio or booths that are along the window that line the water.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiMO5DemKzAUD46b6PBcDcOUYOap-logYZGNCb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnpuOnEEySxqcGASepXgKYFVap4Lwt-q8lj0Vn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

Our take-out was missing an entree. Luckily, I checked my order before driving off, and  no apology was offered by Sol. Once home, we saw the portions for our soup were very small- less than half of a bowl per serving (ordered 2 portions).  Plus, the food tasted mediocre. Feel that our order was thrown together at last minute.
Very disappointed with this recent experience with Sol Mexican Cocina. My previous dining experiences were much better.< /text>

First time here and LOVED IT! Everything from the ambience, food and staff are first class. Have to give a big shout out to one of our waiters, JC. Super funny and personable going the extra mile to make sure we had a great experience. Highly recommend the carnitas plate dinner.</Text>

<review>Never go to this restaurant on a Saturday night. They take in more business than they can handle plus which they work with every delivery platform which makes it impossible to get food in a timely manner. If you do decide to get food delivered from here, expect it to take at least an hour and a half.< /review>< rate>

<userid>101227630042527029124< /userid><Text>WILL NEVER GO BACK.  We called twice to make sure they had bottomless mimosas since it was not on the menu, we were told they did have them for $12. Once we arrived the waiter told us they don’t do bottomless but have a $3 mimosa deal, we were bummed since they lied to us over the phone but said ok because the $3 deal seemed decent. Then we get the check and it has $5 mimosas on it. We tell our waiter this was a mistake and he said he told us it was a $3-5 range for mimosas. He leaves and takes $10 off, after tax and the %18 gratuity. We we’re shocked. After this we asked to speak to a manger. We specifically said “oh $3 is a good deal so we can do that.” The manager never came to talk to us after 15 minutes so we sought him out. After speaking with him he gave us $35 off our $300+ check, again after our original check. Nowhere near the difference between 19 mimosas if they were $3, not $5 AND this “discount” was after our original amount with tax and %18 gratuity. Veryyyyy disappointed in the staff and management. They did not try to help us. They were extremely rude and fought us on everything they had previously told us. Why tell us you had bottomless mimosas TWICE when you don’t serve them? I’ve never heard of a “range” for pricing on OJ/champagne mimosas! Absolutely ridiculous. Would not recommend this place to anyone. Mediocre food for high prices too.<//Text>< rate>

Can't decide which part of dinner was the best. Attentive service for our large party, good variety of food options, and drinks with homemade mixes made with fresh juice. Don't ignore the black bean dip and salsa - made fresh and the bean dip nice and warm. I had the beet and watermelon salad and the black bean and sweet potato tacos, followed by the salted caramel pudding for dessert. It was worth every calorie! Hope to be back next time I visit southern California!<//review>

The service was terrible! I guess my group didn’t look rich enough, because our waiter basically ignored our table, while giving plenty of attention to other tables around us.

The food was mediocre, fairly bland and with small portions. For the prices charged, I expect either very tasty or big portions.

With all the Mexican food options in the area, this is at the bottom of the list.<//review>

<text>Great service with a view of the boats/harbor. Niko was our server and he was amazing with his customer service, making us feel welcome for our first time, and making some great food recommendations. The happy hour is fairly priced and the food exceeds that.

The atmosphere is friendly, comfortable and welcoming. I was hoping to go back before we left but we’re short on time.

Highly recommended for authentic Mexican food.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>They told us they have bottomless mimosas over the phone. They instead had a deal on them. Didn’t honor it. Super disappointed in the service.

What can I say, SOL is amazing. From there cocktails to food, hands down a must in you are in Newport Beach. Taco vampiro !! OMG you must trying it, with steak. I can’t put into works the flavor in the tacos. Next is there grilled shrimp tacos and breaded as well, all are insanely amazing. SOL’s chorizo and queso skillet is definite as well as there aqua chille and shrimp ceviche. The atmosphere at SOL tops it off, live music, beautiful outdoor views of the water and surrounding area, just amazing.</Review>

Best Mexican food in the area by far. The vampiro tacos are the best tacos I ever had and I very highly recommend them. It is right on the water with an amazing view of back bay and the port and It also has boat parking. Perfect place to throw any event because they have a back area on the water in the restaurant. The food has always been amazing and They have really good valets out front</text>

I recently booked a business dinner (30 people) at Sol Mexican Cocina and it was a huge it! Despite the reservation being a little short notice, the event staff and day-of staff were fantastic. Everyone enjoyed the food and the room that was booked for us was perfect. Thanks so much for facilitating a stress-free and special night!<//text>

<Review>Good food , very flavorful. Service possibly depending on time was hit or miss, plus it was so dark we could not read the menu without the phone flashlight. We got there at 5:30pm on Taco Tuesday - a busy day for this place we were told. Still would recommend this. Their Hot Ceviche appetizer was fantastic and so were the margaritas. $3 street taco specials. What's not to like!< /Review>< pictures>

He had a bad attitude about being asked about Calories in the skinny margarita- told us to ask a bartender. We were seated at a table. Did not bother to even refill our water once. Also recommended a $28 shrimp dish with 4 shrimp. No, he did not tell us that there were 4 shrimp. $7 shrimp y’all. There was no gold leaf decor for that price either.

<review>My wife and I were exploring in the Newport and Balboa area and happened to find SOL restaurant.  We stopped in and were pleasantly surprised.  The food was very tasty and the service was excellent. They provided a black bean dip along with some tomatillo salsa, but the table also had a habanero salsa that was GREAT. It was not too spicy and went great with the street tacos I had. They were able to accommodate us even without a reservation. The only downside was the price, but given the location of the restaurant I guess I should expect a higher price for lunch. Be prepared to spend $50 (including tip) for lunch without alcohol. I would definitely recommend this eatery for lunch. I will try dinner very soon.</review>< pics>

Great location including valet parking. The food was good with an interesting twist to normal Mexican food standards. A busy nice place for good Mexican food. A little on the loud side but only because of it's popularity.  Service was very attentive and prompt.</Text>

Food was great, location is good, the view is wonderful, atmosphere was nice my only complaint is the service was a little slow but acceptable. We were a larger group and we expect food to take longer. But we went through the chips (their version of chips were fantastic) and salsa and they were slow to replenish them and drinks. Will we go again? Most likely.<//text>

<review>Love this restaurant but the service is awful. It’s takes forever for your server to come to your table to get your orders. Then you have to sit there forever for them to make your drinks and bring your food. Then you turn around and the servers are all standing around chit chatting for a good 5 to 10 minutes. That show that at the time that we go there which is around 9pm, the restaurant is not as busy for them to take forever. It’s really frustrating.< /review><date>1574009582466<//date>< Name>

<text>The Food tasted very bland which was very disappointing considering the prices, normally I don't complain about prices at restaurants but honestly with the prices they have here you'd expect better quality. Every beer they brought me was warm, so after 3 tries i gave up and just ordered water which ended up being warm tap water. The service was decent but thats the only positive thing i have to say about this place, but honestly the service wasn't good enough to make me want to go back for bland food and warm drinks. If you're really hungry and you're in the area I recommend you avoid this place, it will definitely fill your stomach but you'll leave completely unsatisfied and odds are you won't finish your food, neither me or my group of friends could finish our food just due to it tasting like paper towels. Keep in mind that this is just my opinion and that there could be people out there who enjoyed this place, however for me it just didn't appeal to my palate. I hope this review helps anyone who reads it. And with that I'm off, stay hungry my friends.<//text>< Pics>

This place has a very nice interior and the environment; the food is a little hit and miss. For a vegetarian, there are a few options but nothing to brag about. Unfortunately, you need to examine your food carefully if you are pure vegetarian as it sometimes contains a little meat (been there, done that). 4 stars for the cool vibe.<//text>

I always find it difficult to find good Mexican food. This was one of the best Mexican food experiences I've had in a long time. I had the grilled burrito with steak and it was absolutely amazing. Sadly, I'm from out of town but if I come back into town, this is definitely a place I would want to go again.</review>

Sol provides a low key chill vibe to Newport Harbor. This is not your typical lunch truck Mexican food. I would deem it authentically progressive and is definitely true to taste. The portions could be larger and happy hour adds to the affordability factor. I'd deem this a definite date spot after a drive down PCH.

Enjoy< /text>

Now, this is one that deserves the five stars! Great friendly and attentive service. Great management of a big, well decorated and roomy restaurant with a nice view. It is on the high end but prices are not extravagant for the quality of food you get. Very well made and tasty food. Aside from the octopus being a little overcooked, the soup itself was very tasty and the rest of the food was fantastic. You have to try the roasted corn on the cob as they bring it to you and cut it off the cob for you at your table. Definitely a must try place if you're in the area!< /review>

< Review>
This place has a very nice interior and the environment; the food is a little hit and miss. For a vegetarian, there are a few options but nothing to brag about. Unfortunately, you need to examine your food carefully if you are pure vegetarian as it sometimes contains a little meat (been there, done that). 4 stars for the cool vibe.</Review>

Food is great but limited gluten free options because they put BEER in everything! Mexican food is naturally mostly gluten free until you put BEER in the guacamole! Guac is great and doesn't need BEER.</text>

Sol provides a low key chill vibe to Newport Harbor. This is not your typical lunch truck Mexican food. I would deem it authentically progressive and is definitely true to taste. The portions could be larger and happy hour adds to the affordability factor. I'd deem this a definite date spot after a drive down PCH.

Enjoy< /Review>

Now, this is one that deserves the five stars! Great friendly and attentive service. Great management of a big, well decorated and roomy restaurant with a nice view. It is on the high end but prices are not extravagant for the quality of food you get. Very well made and tasty food. Aside from the octopus being a little overcooked, the soup itself was very tasty and the rest of the food was fantastic. You have to try the roasted corn on the cob as they bring it to you and cut it off the cob for you at your table. Definitely a must try place if you're in the area!</review>

<review>The Food tasted very bland which was very disappointing considering the prices, normally I don't complain about prices at restaurants but honestly with the prices they have here you'd expect better quality. Every beer they brought me was warm, so after 3 tries i gave up and just ordered water which ended up being warm tap water. The service was decent but thats the only positive thing i have to say about this place, but honestly the service wasn't good enough to make me want to go back for bland food and warm drinks. If you're really hungry and you're in the area I recommend you avoid this place, it will definitely fill your stomach but you'll leave completely unsatisfied and odds are you won't finish your food, neither me or my group of friends could finish our food just due to it tasting like paper towels. Keep in mind that this is just my opinion and that there could be people out there who enjoyed this place, however for me it just didn't appeal to my palate. I hope this review helps anyone who reads it. And with that I'm off, stay hungry my friends.<//review><user>108538044275684238119</user>< pictures>

This establishment surpassed my expectations with quality. The service, food, drink, and atmosphere were wonderful!
I enjoyed the chips with salsa and bean dip when we say down. The burrito with rice and beans was quite tasty and filling. The spicy mango margaritas are particularly excellent!< /Review>

I can definitely say that SOL Mexican Cocina is some of the best Mexican / Spanish food I've had from a restaurant in a pretty good long while I love just what everything about this place the ambiance is really good it's very show and they have a gorgeous view of the nearby Marina or dock whatever you want to call it The food definitely seems worth the price even if the menu seems a bit restrictive I appreciate it because whatever is on the menu is cooked very well with deep flavors I would say the only thing that would have been a little bit of a bump in the road is our waitress sing a little bit irritated with us but maybe she was having a bad day or something I don't know everyone else that worked there was definitely top shelf and very niceI would say if you want some good quality food in this area I would definitely check them out<//Text>

So many dishes to choose from and you just can't go wrong!

I've been here over 30X and I still love and crave the good and drinks. Great for big group too or to just go by yourself for lunch. You can bring your dog on the patio as well.

Highly recommend this place< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I visited yesterday and the experience was mediocre. I was given chips and salsa and the server took the plate while I was eating. When I wanted to speak with a manager, it took longer than expected to speak with the person. The happy hour price of the margarita should be the same as the margarita that is not on happy hour in terms of size and quantity.<//text>

<Review>Great food. Really interesting, and tasty. Prices in line with a Newport waterfront location, which means it comes across as pricey, particularly if you add alcohol. That doesn't disqualify it; but knowing it on the way in is helpful. I've been impressed with the food, and that's really the key here.<//Review><username>Tom Jewell</username>< GmapID>

<review>I love the atmosphere. The fireplace in the center of the bar area gives it a special touch. Taco Tuesday has copious amounts of high quality tacos at discounted rates. Get there early because it gets packed quickly. If you mind standing and prefer to sit, then reservations on this day are helpful . The waiter I had last visit even made me a custom ginger ale soda which was one of the best I have had the pleasure to drink. A definite recommend.< /review>< time>

Food was excellent. Prices not too bad for OC however we were a party of 25 and service sucked big time. We only saw our waitress 3 times (to order, bring out food and collect plates/check. She knew she was getting her tip anyway and she sure did show it. I would never go there again. We even had to keep asking different waiters/waitresses for water. What a waste of money especially since we were celebrating 2 birthdays!<//text>

Great way for my co-workers and I to end the work week and start our weekend at SOL Cucina!
The restaurant was buzzing with people and activities and the staff are friendly and attentive.  Our beautiful hostess, Kendra, was very sweet and patient as we gals chatted away and couldn't decide what to order.  The manager, Kevin, came by and gave us some recommendations and he was spot on.   Now, that's teamwork and service!
Our feast:
1. Bull Dog Margaritas - refreshing
2. Hot & Raw Ceviche- super fresh
3. Naked Guacamole and beet/sweet potato chips - tasty & healthy
4. Chicken Salad
5. Casa Noble teguilla with a chaser of Sangrita- savory
Yeah- you can say we can a good time!  Bonus- valet parking and a great view of boats, kayakers, sunset.  Can't wait to go back for round 2.< /Text>

Couldn't believe this place.  My sister in law had called several weeks in advance to make a reservation to celebrate my father-in-law's 61st birthday.  When we arrived, they turned us away claiming they had no such reservation.  Not only was the reservation made weeks before but twice earlier in the week we called to make some changes and make sure they could accommodate our particular circumstances.  My sister-in-law received a text message with the confirmation.  She showed this to the employees who blamed the issue on a change in their system.  After several minutes, they brought out the manager who also told us there was nothing he could do.  Didn't even offer to do anything about it.  Very unprofessional and honestly just surprising.  Any place that treats their customers this way obviously doesn't care about their reputation but I'm leaving this review so others don't have the same experience I did.< /text>

Fantastic dinner! Our food was delicious and had character.... this is not your typical "beans and rice" Mexican restaurant.  I loved the array of sauces, pepper relishes and dips.  It was easy for our family to customize their plate to suit their taste. The staff was prompt, courteous and working very hard to make us happy.... job well done!  Quality from start to finish!< /Review>

Super busy on a Monday. Staff was very nice and accommodating once they were able to take our order. Smothered chicken burrito was excellent!</Text>

My sister in law had called several weeks in advance to make a reservation to celebrate my father-in-law's 61st birthday.  When we arrived, they turned us away claiming they had no such reservation.  Not only was the reservation made weeks before but twice earlier in the week we called to make some changes and make sure they could accommodate our particular circumstances.  My sister-in-law received a text message with the confirmation.  She showed this to the employees who blamed the issue on a change in their system.  After several minutes, they brought out the manager who also told us there was nothing he could do.  Didn't even offer to do anything about it.  Very unprofessional and honestly just surprising.  Any place that treats their customers this way obviously doesn't care about their reputation but I'm leaving this review so others don't have the same experience I did.< /Text>< Pictures>

<rate>4</rate><text>Delicious food with a great waterfront location! When it's busy the wait staff will not be able to get to you as quick as you like. Order water, drinks, and or chips and salsa the minute you get seated! Have your drink orders and apps orders ready when they come back with your water and chips. Be an efficient customer so you minimize having to goose neck around looking for wait staff.</text>< pictures>

<review>Didn’t even get to eat here, but I don’t think I’ll even bother to try. They don’t seem to care about their customers. We made a reservation 3 weeks in advance for my dad’s birthday dinner, got confirmation from the restaurant. Even called the restaurant the night before to confirm again and make sure there was room for our 3 small children. However, upon arrival, the hostess claimed there was no reservation for our group of 13. We even showed them proof of our reservation and they claimed they changed booking systems and wouldn’t honor our reservation or try to make room for us. Totally ridiculous.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I've been here twice- both times for brunch. Food and drinks are very delicious.  Service is excellent apart from the hostess losing our reservation that I had made the evening before.  Luckily we were still able to sit out on the patio. Ill be coming back to try their taco Tuesday menu soon!< /Review>

Sol has added some new brunch items! Yay! Including a vegetarian one. The La Vida Quinoa Bowl is perfect! Just wish it had beans, since their beans are delicious! You can order your bowl with seitan or eggs - or do what I did and order both! The bowl also comes with poblano chiles, caramelized onions, squash, Kale, quinoa, and barley, topped with salsa verde, avocado, and choice of fried egg or chipotle garlic seitan. My new favorite menu item! I'll see if they can substitute half beans for the quinoa mix!!< /Text>

One of my favorite restaurants for dining on the water. The new server named Lake left such a great impression on us we made sure to tell the manager on duty how fantastic his service was. I reccommend a reservation and if dining inside it can be a bit loud.<//Text>

Service Sucked.. Pregame your alcohol before you get there because your going to be waiting along time for the next one.. had to order a beer mid way before I finished so that I wouldn't  wait long after I finished.... the food and atmosphere is on point.. I liked it a lot would go back but I'll drink before I get there.</Text>

Unfortunate experience today at this restaurant.   I asked the bald bartender (never caught his name) about the ingredients in a drink and his response was so dismissive and opinionated that I didn’t want to even dare ask anymore questions as his response made me feel so uncomfortable. Our drinks came and they were mediocre at best and when my fiancé suggested fresh squeezed juice would be worth the price the bartender was rude and somewhat demeaning. So not only was our drink not enjoyable but the service wasn’t either. The only thing I enjoyed about the restaurant was the location and the live music.<//text>

Been here a few times and.usually fairly good.  Yesterday, everything was off, with a bad batch of dipping salsa, so-so tacos and very bland rice.  It's never great, but the views and atmosphere usually make up for mediocre food. It's a toss up whether I'll return for the great location and.live with mediocre food.</Text>

< Review>
I have been here in the past and enjoyed their margaritas. I always thought they were one of the best in the area. My girlfriend and I decided to stop by for a couple, last night after happy hour. After waiting around for an empty seat, we settled for the bar. Ordered the usual "house margaritas" and they were not only weak AF but also very watered down. No lime taste and no kick at all. When I asked the bartender about them, he said it was the same formula they have used for years. I tried to argue and he said I must have ordered the "skinny" in the past. I don't order skinny margaritas, EVER. He insisted so I drank the watered down lemonade I was served. My girlfriend however made him serve her a margarita with lime juice instead of the garbage she was served. We also ordered some guacamole to go with our chips. This was also altered. Not pure avocado as it should be. Slimed down with tomato added to it. We didn't order anything else after that. The bartender had the audacity to ask me if I wanted another margarita. I laughed, and said no. Then we got the bill and he charged us for 3 margaritas instead of 2.  I will never again bother with this place. El Ranchito down the street makes them way better. Not posh like this place, but who cares?< /Review>

Great view if you sit in the back! Gets a little hot cause some of your party is going to be in direct sunlight so open the windows.

Food is great! Got the ahogado and split it with a friend and was the perfect amount of food. Served with free chips, salsa, and bean dip.< /Text>

<review>Taco Tuesday - packed but delicious!  Of the three tacos I had - short rib, viper, and Cubano - I liked the viper the best by far. Of note are also the Mexican session ipa (delicious) and the street corn (a must get every time).< /review>< pics>

This is eaisly one of the best casual dining spots in Newport Beach.  It is located right on the water and has a decent view of the harbor.  The food here is fantastic and I have yet to try something I didn't like.  In addition to the restaurant there is also a bar area with a few TV's.  Valet is complimentary and reservations are recommended.  Make sure to check serving sizes as some of the tacos are a bit small.  Prices are consummate with what you'd expect in NB.</Review>

<review>The food was pretty good. The waiting staff was pretty good too. However, the hostesses screwed up on a surprise party and gave no effort to resolve that the lost a reservation regardless of showing e-confirmations. They lacked all sensitivity over the matter which is the two stars... Very poor taste left.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Great view if you sit in the back! Gets a little hot cause some of your party is going to be in direct sunlight so open the windows.

Food is great! Got the ahogado and split it with a friend and was the perfect amount of food. Served with free chips, salsa, and bean dip.<//review>

After reading about the family who had a birthday reservation weeks in advance was turned away I decided to change my mind about reserving this place for a birthday. That was terrible to do to a family!!!

<text>Food is delicious, I like the fact that they they're in their own lil twist to make it different. Our waitress was great! The atmosphere was loud and very dark, kinda hard to see what's in my food let alone take a pic without using your flash, Personally I like to be able to see my food and inspect it lol! Besides all the lil things it's a great place and can't wait to go again, maybe day time might be different.</text>< Resp>

< Review>
It is located right on the waterfront with view of the marina. Self parking is a bit scarce but they do have the option of valet parking as well.
The service was great, from the hostess all the was to the busser, everyone one is on point.
The food was delicious, it was too choice seafood, and the Mexican food is also well done, and with great presentation. That being said it is expensive food Mexican food, I have had cheaper food that tasted just as good.
The drink selection is great, heavily tequila based, specializing in Margaritas. Their speciality cocktails(Margaritas 90%) are all made with quality tequila and reasonably priced.
Overall it was a great experience< /Review>

The food is usually good and I do like their salsa. Sometimes the service feels a little off, either hurried or some days lackadaisical. Last visit we had to move tables cause the one we were sat at was so loose it wobbled all over. Foods good but I think they need to tighten up their operations a bit.< /Review>

Hard to get a reservation but there is “free seating” at the bar. However if you wait for a table or a spot at the bar all of the sudden the spot will be “reserved” when clearly someone simply paid the bartender. Horrible service</text>

<Text>Let me start off by saying Sol used to be one of my favorite places to go to in Orange County.  The drinks were always strong, the food was consistently delicious, and the service was spot on... However, after tonight's dining experience I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.

Upon arriving the energy  was great and it wasn't even difficult to find a seat in the bar area. Unfortunately, that's as positive as it gets.

Our server Bianca took forever to acknowledge us. After she finally arrived at our table it took what I would consider to be an unreasonably long time to get our drink order to us.

By the time Bianca got our drinks to us our drinks were watered down indicating they had been sitting for a while. At $14.00 a drink you'd think you'd get your drink in a more timely manner.

Unfortunately, the food seemed to be a bit off as well. The Ceviche was fresh and tasty but lacked SALT (truth be told there wasn't very much fish either). The salads were flavourful and decent sized but the shrimps were about the size of a nickle.  On a  positive note the shrimp taquitos were delicious.

It literally took approximately 35 minutes after we finished our meal to get Bianca's attention and finally get our check. It took another 15 minutes for her to retrieve it so we could leave.

With so many available dining options in the area I'm surprised at how much Sol has taken for granted.< /Text>< gmapID>

Surprising incredible food.  The flavors and presentation were unique and fantastic.  I thought Javier's had a lock on Mexican gourmet, but I think they may have been beaten by Sol.<//Text>

Good place to get happy hour. They have deals on tacos and drinks, as well as free chips and salsa and bean dip. They have a nice view of the harbor, and it's one of the few places that you can pull your duffy or boat up to and have some food or drinks.</Text>

Food was good, service was the worst, no communication with the hostess and servicer. Waited 32 mins to get a glass of water and a server even we spoke to a server 5-6 mins waiting and was told she was not our server and would tell our server.

At the 23 min mark I went to find a hostess to ask for the manager and he came by 4.45 mins later. No apologies just he will send the server by. Another 4 mins went by as we grabbed our jackets to leave and they brought water.

The server was apologetic saying she didn't know we were there and wasn't told, even though she walked passed us 8-13 times with drinks and to go to the bar. The manager never came by to check on us to ensure we were ok and if the food was good as I had addressed him with the poor service.

Having been in the industry for up to my late 20s as server, bartender, supervisor, manager I know the full service cycle and expected wait times. From fast food, casual, fine dining, from restaurant chains to 5 star resorts and 5 diamond rated restaurants. The place will be going down hill due to the management.</Text>

Went for a cousin's bday party. The party members were seated at a non-handicap friendly spot. The staff politely swooped our disabled guest out of her wheel chair and flew down a flight of stairs with grace.

I normally enjoy half-hearted birthday songs at restraraunts. Not so here. Show stopping birthday song. Highly recommend.

Be prepared to have a man steal the show with a beautiful voice holding a glorious set of notes in your honor.

Food 👌👍 but seemed a little pricey.</text>

Ordered carne asada it  had a funny flavor they said it was the mesquite.  I use mesquite at home and I don't think it was that . I chose not to finish my meal. The place is very nice inside though by the beach and had great cocktails<//Text>

<Text>Food was fresh and good. A little pricy but understandable due to waterfront location and nice decor. Unfortunately, they lost a couple stars from me due to: 1. The waiter charging me $2.50 for soda water from the tap, and 2. We got the churro dessert (it was delicious) which came with a scoop of ice cream but what we got was more like a bottle cap's worth. We asked for a little more ice cream and that found its way on to our bill too. Overall, really nice date night, but it's always annoying when you're paying that kind of money for food and get nickeled and dimed where you shouldn't.</Text>< pics>

I love SOL. I have been to multiple SOL locations so I already knew I would like the food. The food and drinks are a little expensive, but everything is really good and worth the price, in my opinion.

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of one time when my friends and I went and it was PACKED. We asked how long the wait was and the hostess was kind of indifferent about us being there and told us the bar is opening seating and we can go check if there are seats "I guess." So we walked through a crowded restaurant with servers running all over the place to get to the bar just to find that all the bar seats were taken.<//Text>

Worse costumer service ever. The manager Kevin was so rude to our party when we asked why our reservations were not going to be accommodated. We made reservations and they couldn't even sit us at the time we reserved. If I would of known then I would had gone somewhere else for dinner instead of waiting forever to see if they could even sit us. Kevin was arrogant and rude.< /Text>

Outstanding ceviches and amazing taco selections.  We've tried them all, including the surprising vegetarian option.  This is Mexican cuisine ... not Mexican "food."  Prepare to be enchanted.  The chef is a superstar.<//Text>

We went to Sol in Newport Beach for the first time this week. The food was amazing and varied infused with true Baha flavors. Unfortunately the margarita's were very disappointing. We love a good Cadillac margarita and have found a number of them around town. The Cadillac's we were served at Sol were watered down and didn't seem to have any tequilla in them. We know a good margarita when we have one so this was very disappointing. At $13.00 for a 12 oz glass we felt ripped off. If they can improve on their drinks we will definitely go back or just order a beer instead.< /review>

Mixed reviews here.  Nice location, harbor views.  Food would be mostly good if price was appropriate to flavor.  I got two tacos which was like 16 bucks which would of been good 5 ish dollar tacos. (Still expensive by many standards).  There's enough craft taco places out there that you need to deliver if your going at that price point.  They do make a solid, and large, michelada though.< /review>

We always go to SOL after our business mastermind meetings. Great food and Margaritas! We usually go on Fridays and the place is packed. I suggest making a reservation before hand.</Text>

The pricing is very decent for this area actually; some items can be pricey, like the $11 'El Jefe' Taco, but that's also because it has Filet Mignon and Shrimp in it, and is the best damn taco I've ever had in my life.

It's like you walked into a Lisa Vanderpump reality restaurant trash in LA were employees think they are the next big anything so they dont give a S*** they are only there to look for a sugar anything! Ceviche came out warm and smelled like catfood! It's sad that they bring out a roasted corn and cut it in front of you like if that's suppose to be impressive that's one level close to the corn at a cheap OC fair.. The taco meat had no marinated flavor looks pretty but tastes like plastic.Dont be fooled by the good location just keep going south and go to the Winery instead for real good, service & view.<//Text>< date>

Great food and service. Worth a visit, especially on taco Tuesday, when it's a real bargain. There's live music, which makes it really loud. (Don't expect to have a conversation across the table).< /text>

About the most overpriced below average food I've ever eaten. I'll never go back. Drinks are a straight out rip off.  Stay away unless you want to pay way too much for very average food to sit on the water. So they have is their location.<//text>

Then when our food got to the table I was like what is that because it didn't even look good enough to eat. So over all they don't even know what is baja food so they should just stop what they are doing. If you want real baja tacos go to Tacos El Gordo.< /review><userid>114983882997541596091<//userid><Rating>1<//Rating>< GmapID>

< review>
I'm giving it 2 stars for the view, right by the marina. The menu is ok, but come on, Newport Beach is not the place to get Mexican. They throw cotija cheese on everything, don't get me wrong, I love cotija, but it doesn't make your dish gourmet. Over priced Birria, birria is a cheap dish to make, the cut off beef isn't premium. I would say go elsewhere for authentic good Mexican food, go here if you want to impress someone or have dinner while looking at boats.</review>

I have wanted to visit this restaurant for quite some time and I finally did today for lunch.  The staff and food are excellent.  The manager, Mario, was extremely professional and accommodating.  I had two of the signature tacos, the Vampiro and the fish taco, both were great.  I started with the guacamole sol and the ceviche and had a blackberry-ginger margarita...I would order all of these again and I look forward to returning.<//text>

The food is great but the service was slow. Not sure i would recommend it if you need to get out in a reasonable time. We booked the patio but was told   ON ARRIVAL that there was a private party therefore no seats there. So two weeks ago you didn't know that???< /text>

The restaurant is nicely furnished and rather nice. Our waitress was really friendly and so was the hostess when we walked in. The food is a bit pricy, but worth it. The chips they served us with were really big but the guac was a very expensive appetizer we weren't sure we should invest in. The duck taco was really tasty, but only really made two tacos and not three like the menu claimed. My mother's used thd extra tortilla because her taco was pretty large and well stuffed. The torta that my sister ordered was rather large and very tasty. Overall a very nice experience with good food. The only thing that ruined our late brunch was a very loud and rowdy group next to the bar which was being particularly vulgar.< /text>

5 stars for the service. Everybody  was polite and respectful.  My girlfriend and i were visiting so cal and our friends from OC wanted us to try this place.

But personally i did not care for the food, they try to make mexican dishes into something they are not. Example in MY opinion a taco is only suppose to have meat, onions, salsa, and cilantro and should run no more than 1.25. Here at SOL they do not follow that. Me and my girlfriend  paid 48$ for 2 beers 1 taco 1 burrito.....  all this while our friends were raving how this place is one of the best Mexican restaurants arounds. But personally the only thing Mexican about it is decor and beer. Overall great service but two words "no manchen"< /review>

Food good, service ok, ambiance loud. The salsa was ok. We had crab benedicto and the egg was cooked not poached. The souflee was very good. The server didn't offer coffee which was weird for brunch. They didnt clear the table of excessive placings when we were seated. If you like strong drinks, they serve them here. The parking is complementary valet.<//Text>

<review>Piss poor manager working on 9/20/17 around 530pm..... the waitress was sooooo kind she knew we did not like the food WE ONLY TOOK ONE BITE EACH!!! She said she would ask the manager to comp the food for us, we did not suggest that, but the waitress was right!!! We did not like the food and it's not like we ate half then complained.... This was our honeymoon night out and it was RUINED BY THE SOL "MANAGER".... hope the bad review was worth 21$ of awful food.... HORRIBLE AWFUL MANAGER!!!! We will tell all of our family and friends NOT to eat at this establishment!< /review><gmap_id>0x80dce07532ac1e4d:0xe82f0fb0287bb775<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Response>None< /Response><date>1446584503989<//date><Review>Came for Sunday Brunch and ended up getting the OC Restaurant Week lunch! I reserved via open table and requested a table out in the back patio because we were entertaining friends from out of town. and they certainly delivered! it was a gorgeous Sunday and we had a beautiful view of the marina with the sun beaming down. it was perfect!  check in on yelp and you get a $5 margarita! although.....i do believe its a smaller size of their regular one as i saw some people at another table with much bigger margaritas than us. either way, it was still DELISH!

the complimentary chips and salsa is absolutely.....addicting! they dont give you the plain ol tortillas chips. they're like huge tortillas they bake (or fried, but i'll just keep telling myself its baked to make myself feel better about eating them).the only the thing is you have to break them into actual dippable pieces. not only do they give you salsa but they also give you beans to dip your chips. omg. soo good....i'm drooling just thinking about it.

anyway, we initially came here for the brunch options but it was the last day of OC Restaurant Week so we decided to just order off the lunch menu for $15. for the 1st course, i had a goat cheese side salad and for the entree, i had the 3 taco sampler, one each of the meexcal chicken, carnitas and carne asada and for my side option, i went with the quinoa salad. out of everything i had, i think the quinoa salad was my favorite! lol not saying everything else sucked, because it didnt. the tacos were good and the side salad was good but the quinoa salad to me was outstanding. but honestly, it was the chips and salad that won me over and will come back again for more!

parking : complimentary parking only
view: ask for patio seating on a nice day
staff: very nice servers here!
drink: margarita was just right
food: delicious<//Review>< Rating>

Don’t attempt to eat here if you plan to dine alone. You will be treated like a outcast and asked to sit in some random spot that isn’t even a table.</review>

< review>
(Translated by Google) Terrible service since we arrived, when we were given a table we asked for the letter or the menu and they told us that only online could and after a few minutes another table arrived and there they were given the menu ..... The ladies who attended with a look of few friends.
Only one of them behaved up to the task and in a good way, everything else is not worth it

(Original)
Pésimo servicio desde que llegamos, al darnos mesa pedimos la carta o el menú y nos dijeron que solo por online se podía y a los pocos minutos llegó otra mesa y ahi si les dieron el menú .....  Las señoritas que atendían con cara de pocos amigos.
Solo una de ellas se comportó a la altura y de buen modo, todo lo demás no vale la pena< /review>

<rate>4<//rate><Text>(Translated by Google) Maxican food at New Port beach, Irvine California.
I really like Mexican food especially tacos, but here you get special tacos, delicious and for those of us from Indonesia, you definitely like Maxico-style chili and served with rice.
Unfortunately for our booking we were unable to full it so I waited 30 minutes to get a seat.

Maxican food di New Port beach, Irvine California.
Saya sangat suka makanan Mexico terutama Taco, namun disini anda mendapatkan Taco yg istimewa ,enak dan bagi kita yg dari Indonesia pasti suka sambel ala Maxico dan disajikan pula dengan nasi.
Sayang untuk booking kita tidak bisa saking penuhnya saya menunggu 30 menit untuk bisa mendapatkan tempat duduk.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>
