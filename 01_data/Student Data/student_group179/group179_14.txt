I admired her for she's really great in her profession. I was so happy because I feel beautiful with my new look. Yesterday, I'm looking for a barbershop that can get the style that I want for my hair. And I found this shop and the best stylist in town. Thank you very much!< /review>

He began to shave my hair and he kept staring at my beard after that and tried to make changes just to make it fine. His attention to detail was greatly regarded. He does not in any way make you feel stressed. I'm very pleased with the operation!< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I brought my son to this barbershop a week ago. I was so happy with my son's new-look. I thanked your barber man for the excellent and perfect work he did at that time. Five stars for the overall work of your barber! You are strongly recommended to everyone! Until next time! Thank you so much, guys!< /Review>< Name>

Their flowers, bouquet arrangements, and flower stand are all top-notch and well worth the price. This is my go-to flower shop for every reason. You can choose from a number of flower designs. You can also make changes based on your personal preferences. They're still in charge of timely and reliable delivery. It is strongly suggested!</review>

Riley is truly wonderful.

Not only did I get an excellent haircut, I had great time while I got it.

The intake method, timing, etc. are all perfect and riley is always on time with appointments.

As long as I live in dtla, this is where I’m headed.<//text>

<Review>I love getting my hair cuts at this Barbershop also because my boys love getting their haircut here! The barber's attention to detail and patience with my boys is unlike most at least in my experience, not to mention them blue eyes. Also, great environment for the kids and has a flavor to it that makes it unique. Prices are generally the same as most other shops but the talent and staff out measures your average hair salon. I always recommend this barbershop to anyone!< /Review><date>1591899969425< /date>< gmap_id>

<review>What a great experience with Riley. Finding the place was a bit difficult since they’re located inside a building without signage, but instructions are provided to you via email when booking. Hint, it’s on the 11th floor. Parking is either street or paid lot but it’s DTLA, get used to it.

Riley is a skilled expert in her craft, extremely engaging and funny, and has a rad Nike shoe collection and Supreme. Plus, there’s a cute cat lounging when you first walk in. Looking forward to my next cut here.<//review>< Rate>

They are very friendly, flexible, and you can check-in online simply on their website. Their price is competitive to other barbershops, but other shops usually aren't so big and hygienic. They have a waiting area with sofas, and you'll get coffee or drinks while you are waiting free of charge! I will give a 5-star rating and would recommend them!</text>

Will admit it was weird at first finding the location, but it was a wonderful experience. They took their time with the haircut and made sure to look at the tiny details. Was very happy with the results and definitely will be going back. It is a bit different especially in these corna times. It is a single person at a time establishment, but gives an hr block per person. They have a no shoe policy, be prepared to take off your kicks, so make sure to you dont have smelly feet lol. Not a place if you have cat allergies, they do have a shop pet. 10/10 will go again<//Text>

Riley is excellent when it comes to cutting hair, she's not all about the frills of a hair stylist. She is a true barber and it is hard to find someone that remember the way you like your hair , Riley is very persistent and does a great job every time. Its nice to be able to get the same results each and every time from the same person, not someone different each time you go like some of the other haircut places. Riley is very courteous and professional. So if your are thinking about finding a new barber, Barber Punk's is the place to go.< /Text>

Barber Punk's is a superior shop owned by a professional, talented, and skilled barber who provide consistently high quality service! I have been a loyal customer since last year. The shop is always clean, well-organized and welcoming Riley takes care of the shop and its supplies, cleaning and straightening between cuts and making sure to welcome each guest. I have always been and continue to be pleased with my haircuts. check out Barber Punk's.

You can never go wrong getting a fresh cut at Barber Punk's!
Riley gave me a great hair cut and was very friendly. I always leave her place very happy with the best service ever.
If you're looking for a professional barber, look no further. My cousin and I comes here twice a month. Riley has always been nice and accommodating.</text>

<text>Amazing barber! Being from NYC finding a good barber is like finding a good doctor. She is awesome! Not only is she amazing with her tapering/fading, she also knows how to style with scissors. Don’t look any further, just book an appointment!<//text>< Pics>

I try as much as possible to make sure my hubby looks his best. His last barber messed up his haircut and couldn't fix it. Riley was recommended to me by one of my girlfriends so I decided to take a chance, and was glad I talked my hubby in going there. He was really impressed with his new look after the hair cut. Riley even suggested the kind of hair style that would best fit the shape of his head. Thank you, Riley! My man looks good!< /Text>

I've had both hips replaced, left 20 + years ago. Been having pain. I have rarely had a doctor that actually listened. If was a pleasant change.

Excellent service performed.  Had second PRP injection in shoulder for partially torn rotator cuff.  I can feel the difference and the re growth of the tear.  Pain wise the change has been magnificent since the two injections. When we began I couldn’t raise my arm higher than a 45 degree angle.  It’s at 100 % now.   The alternative was a $19,000 surgery.  We are really glad paying $2,000 for two PRP treatments and the gradual healing of the body and not having to go under the knife.</text>

< review>
I have been through so many so-called doctors out here trying to get some relief, and finally found this group of real doctors, and medical professionals that know this is a special calling, and treat their patients as such. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and efficient.  I see Karina and what a God send.  She actually listens and follows through, and I am finally hopeful and getting some relief, and actual answers.</review>

This is a wonderful facility except for on thing De Sherfey. This guy made me show up appointment after appointment telling me nothing wrong with my knee. Well apparently there is something wrong they are both ruined now and I am nearly crippled. He never has time for the patient. I do have one question, Dr Sherfey, if there was nothing wrong then why would you operate on me? Oh yeah to get paid. Terrible doctor with no morals or ethics< /Text>

I went to AVORS to see Dr. Heller for a second opinion from the surgery I had five months before. That was the best thing that I did. Dr. Heller performed a second surgery and my hand is so much better. I wish I would’ve started with Dr. Heller from the beginning.</Review>

<review>I have been going to AVORS for a few years. Dr Nasser is awesome, no matter how busy he is always makes you feel like you are special,  Dr Pena is very friendly as is Dr Heller.  None of those 3 make u feel as though u are not worth their time. The staff at the office and surgery center are very friendly.  Great place to go.< /review>< Name>

With in a month, I had my 1st appt. with Dr. Antebi.  I was told exactly what to expect regarding my total hip replacement.  I then went into surgery with no caution or worries. Came home that afternoon.  4 weeks post hip replacement, I am taking it slow without any mobility aids.  I deeply appreciate the direct and professionalism I received while under Dr. Alon Antebi's and his Medical Team's care.  Thank you!<//Text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Justin Heller for a few years for hand pain. I had PRP and had  good response to,the treatment. Dr. Heller has also been treating my knee due to tears in my knee.

This is the only place I will go if I have another orthopedic injury again. Dr. Sherfey preformed a hip and femur surgery on me after I had a bad fall. He was a fantastic dr with a very caring personality. He made me feel very comfortable about the surgery and explained everything to me about the surgery and the after care. When I went to the office for my follow up appointment the staff were all very caring and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this office to anyone who needs orthopedic care.</text>

This has to be the most unprofessional medical group I have ever been involved with. I received a mail from my insurance company requesting a medical necessity letter from AVORS about a procedure i had done and I must had called and told AVORs about the need to have that medical leter sent to my insurance company at least 3 different times but they never did and right now am  stuck with a bill that I should not have ever had. Sadly,  this is not the only issue I have had with this place which seems always unprepared.< /text>

<review>I needed full knee replacement and of course I was real scared about the surgery thinking what was going to be I had for me the rest of my life. Dr. Justin Sherfey has been amazing from the day I met him before the surgery until now while I am going through my rehab. Before I went into the operating room he took a load of me by us praying together but the most important thing is that even a real honest with me. He told me what I was going to go through with the rehab. And he has been right on for the first month. I am walking around doing stairs running in place doing a ski machine at 3 and 1/2 Weeks. He was honest about the pain that I  was going to go through so that when I am feeling it I was warned ahead of time. Nothing was hidden from me. Surgery day it was all a positive experience made by the doctor and everyone they got involved with me every one of the nurses the anesthesiologist and everyone that participated with me that day. I would recommend this doctor and his staff did anyone that asks me.< /review>< Pictures>

Every 10 minutes i get to a message that says I've been on hold for too long and tells me to leave a message but the mailbox is full! When I finally get through to somone she says she can't schedule appointments at the front desk (which isn't true as I've done it) and transfers me to somone else that doesn't return my message.

Now I'm doing the 10 minute holds again except its after 5 so I've just ended up wasting 2 hours<//Text>< pics>

The providers in the back office are 5 star professionals. The front desk women who answer the phones are 1 star. This office has an ongoing problem with long hold times followed by disconnection of the call. If this is the only provider in your network, I strongly advise you DRIVE TO THE OFFICE to take care of business. It'll be faster, I guarantee it. *Been there, done that.*

Yes, I have talked to the Ofc Mgr about it. Two months later it hadn't changed.<//Text>

I was seen for shoulder bursitis. I was given an appointment immediately after my pcp did my referral. The office was clean and they are following social distance guidelines. The staff was friendly and efficient. My wait was a bit longer than I thought it would be but it wasn’t too much of a problem for me.</text>

<Review>I heard about AVORS Medical  from a great friend of mine, who kept raving about this Dr. Nasser. I saw the difference in her from before and after Dr. Nasser and it was like night and day. I went and saw Dr. Nasser, within the first five minutes he had completely won me over. He actually encourages his patients to ask questions and he wants your feedback on what he has prescribed or ordered you to have done. The best thing is he actually remembers your medical history and problems from memory without looking at his paperwork or computer. Anyone who has to deal with doctors on a regular basis knows how rare that is and how comforting it is to not just be another face lost in the crowd. It is not just Dr. Nasser that is amazing, all the other doctors and every single staff member go above and beyond the normal  standard. I have also seen Dr. Pena, and he is great as well. He too listens and welcomes your questions and feedback. I have had to deal with more doctors than I can count but I have never seen the quality of doctors and staff members like I have at AVORS Medical. They are located at  42135 10th Street West, right next to the Social Security office. You will be more than happy and very satisfied with your experience there.

I am so happy with every person of the staff, that I have dealt with. I have never had a bad experience. I love Dr. Nasser and Dr. Pena. They are both super nice and very knowledgeable.

The facility is always very clean. The waiting room is huge and comfortable. The doctors work very hard not to leave you in the room forever. I have only positive input for AVORS!< /Review>

I have seen several Drs. for multiple reasons. I'm very pleased.
My main Dr. Is Dr. Nasser. I have seen him for at least 15 years. He is amazing...he truly cares.
Maria Davis is also one who I have seen often, and she also cares.
I had some issues with partial medications not being sent. Many times I was without over 3 day weekends. I would be told when I went to pick up from the pharmacy, and the Dr's office was closed until Mon. and Tues. 2 times. This has been resolved. The supervisor who oversees those who send medication has me ask for her every month. It has been my only issue ever in 15 plus years long.
I feel AVORS is a wonderful place. The staff is very friendly.  I can't say enough good about the improvement in my pain. If I was unable to see Dr. Nasser, I would not be able to function!<//text>

<review>I have seen Dr Nasser for years and Maria many many times as well.  They are both kind, genuine, knowledgable, and professional people.  They try to exhaust all options to relieve pain of course, but they also really listen to what’s going on with their patient’s health.  I really can’t express enough how much I have appreciated their efforts to help me to improve my health and lessen my pain.  Dr Nasser once started a sentence with “ If you were my mother I would...” and that meant a great deal to me.  He treated me as he would a family member.  That’s not common.   Anyone would be in great hands with either of them and their wonderful staff as well!!!</review>< Pics>

< review>
Dr. Pena ⛑is a great Physician, I relocated from NYC a year ago to Los Angeles CA, and recently purchased a home in Ridgecrest CA. Since, I arrived on the West coast it was a struggle to secure the quality of overall health care I was receiving in New York City for the past 55 years. That all changed when I found Avors medical group in Lancaster CA, The doctor are  extremely knowledgeable about new medical techniques,  treatments, and  holistic methods of care. Dr. Pena, patience and bedside manner is God spent, he's. A good listener and explains things plainly. He never seems rushed. Dr. Pena compassionate is a natural part of his gentle personality. Moreover, his office colleagues and supportive staff are outstanding, courteous and professional. Avors Medical group is providing me with the quality of care that I was receiving in New York City, and I can't be happier. The ones a month drive from Ridgecrest CA to Lancaster CA is more than worth the quality of care I am receiving from Avors. In addition, I have always been seen at my appointment time and they take care of all my insurance paperwork for and medical devices I need and my prescriptions are always sent to the pharmacy in a timely manner.  And if you have questions about your medications after picking them up from the pharmacy, you can call back and the nurse in that department will answer your questions, and will help you resolve any issues or concerns regarding medication.  Avors is a Gold Star Medical Group in my opinion based on experiences with Avors. Greatfully speaking, Cassandra Mazyck</review>

As a new patient at AVORS, I am just learning about the many types of support provided to patients, including monthly appointments with Dr. Thomas Nasser,  collaboration with my neurosurgeon, having staff available to assist with scheduling, medications, and durable medical equipment, and the excellent Acute Rehabilitation Unit at Palmdale Regional  Medical Center. I really had no idea how all-encompassing AVORS is beforehand, and I greatly appreciate all of the assistance being given to me. Thank you!</text>

Doctor Thomas Nasser saved my life and got me off all the pain meds I was taking. He even found me a job. I will be eternally grateful for him and his staff! Please be patient with his staff. He takes a lot of medcare patience even though medicare isn't as profitable as other insurance. The only way to be profitable to keep the doors open is to have a lot of doctors that will do the same. That way people who wouldnt have access to good doctors get quality help, but it can be a little hectic and wait times can be longer so please give the staff a brake there doing the best they can! I am so greatful for Doctor Nasser I made his wife Dr. Susan Nasser my PC and I now travel an hour out of my way to see them both! They're just that good! REALLY!<//review>

<review>If you ever have to have any kind of surgery done. This is the place you'll want to go.

From the moment you walk into the office. You're treated with care, kindness, and love.
You get the exact same treatment though every part of your surgical procedure, including during recovery  when they take you downstairs to meet with your ride home.
They also call after you go home to check on your well being. I've had several different procedures there, and I've never had to wait long, I've always been treated with kindness, and like they know my time is important to me.<//review><user_name>M.P. L< /user_name><Rating>5<//Rating>< Response>

They are a great company and all the doctors I’ve worked with in there are amazing. Very smart and upfront about what’s going on. I love the personality of all of the doctors and staff. You can tell they vet their staff well, and make sure it is a group of well educated employees. As for Dr. Tom Nasser, he’s been a saving grace for me mainly. Without him I’d be stuck in pain and he has fixed that without any strong pain meds!! Proud to go to AVORS!! They make you feel at home.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>I’ve had a previous hip replacement using the lateral approach. This THR Dr Antebi used the Anterior Approach. Dr Antebi is one of the few Orthopedic Surgeons in California that has the expertise and experience with the Anterior Approach, which is less invasive, faster recovery and no restrictions for avoiding dislocation.
I was climbing the hospital stairs the next morning. Dr Antebi visited me 4 times in the recovery room to check up on me. Then he saw me in my private room the next day. I was discharged that afternoon. It’s now 5 weeks post surgery and I’m back on the tennis courts, which is my passion. Joint pain is gone. Couldn’t be more pleased. I highly recommend Dr Antebi with any hip or knee  joint pain. Improvements in quality of life is quite dramatic.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

The staff and outstanding medical professionals are more than simply a cut above. I've used the massage therapist for severe pain issues, and been more than satisfied with significant improvements. Doctor Thomas Nasser, and his Nurse Practitioner Maria Davis have been treating my wife for years. Excellent care both in the office visits, tending to any issues and even making hospital visits when necessary. Excellent relationship and very concerned about the patients. Just haven't seen medical care this good in many years.</review>

I received a call stating Dr.Golden wouldn’t be in the office that day (Sept 25th). So I was told I would be rescheduled for October 30th. If the appointment actually happens it will have been 10 weeks after surgery before I see the surgeon.

Professionalism at it's best! Each staff member exceeded their roles, and was competent with their duties. Also, the environment was warm and friendly, as they exhibited genuine care and concern for my unfortunate situation. Dr. Shefey's  old school beside manner made me become confident with our health care system again; and this was my first visit. Thanks for a surprisingly great experience. : )</Text>

<text>Great service. Once I filled out all the paperwork they got me in very quickly. Once in I was attended to right away. They were very attentive and answered all my questions. I went in for a swollen knee. The doctor (some good looking dude) who looked at my knee had a swollen elbow that he used as a prop to illustrate what was going on in my knee. I thought this is a little like going to a mechanic who has his own car up on blocks, but the truth is he did a really great job explaining what was going on. I hope I never have to, but would go back there in a minute. People in the waiting room, please don't show up in your pajamas! Thank you I will be here all week.

Dr. Alon Antebi, DO performed bilateral hip replacement surgery for me and after the surgery I was as good as new.  He is one of the best orthopedic surgeons I have had and I would recommend him for any orthopedic surgery's.  Thanks to Dr. Thomas Nasser, DO as he helps me out with all of my pain issues and not just pain meds but how to heal, and also his wife Dr. Susan Nasser, DO for being my family doctor.  Doc Susan talks with me on my issues and not just talk at me.   Dr. Jason Heller, MD helped me from with corrective surgery so I can look good again! Dr. Tony Smith, DC works with me from the car accident which caused all 12 surgery's to and the rehab techniques some I have never heard of but works great for me.  AVORS Medical Group has been there for me through all surgery's and rehabilitation to get me walking again.  Maria Davis, NP has been there for me also in using the pain medications to help me and she and Dr. T. Nasser works together not to run for pills but how to use different techniques to heal.  5 STARS FOR AVORS Medical Group 😄😄. The support staff at AVORS are the greatest if I need smile or help they are right there for me.  I do not have to look for any other doctors anywhere else.  This is the A1 medical group.  I recommend any and everyone to go to AVORS Medical Group for all of your medical needs.    Ben Mills, Optician.<//review>< Pics>

< Review>
I had a terrible accident on August 9th and shattered my left wrist and ulna bone. I had to be rushed to Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills. I was in utter shock until I spoke to Dr. Alon Antebi. He assured me that I would be able to use my left hand and arm in four months. Two long hours after my accident, I was ready for surgery. It's been almost two months since my accident and I have 40% of my hand strength and usage back. I owe this quick recovery to Dr. Antebi, Justin Short,  Priscilla and all of the medical staff at Avors Medical Group.</Review>

Dr. Alon Antebi did my hip surgery 8 years ago. Very caring and compassionate and to the point
I recently had knee surgery performed by Dr. Antebi, and im recovering very nicely. Dr. Antebi is the best Orthopedic Dr and Surgeon I've had in my years of going to doctors
AVORS is very organized spacious and clean. The staff is awesome, very professional, caring and friendly. I'd recommend 👌 AVORS to everyone
and among the great Dr's there, my Dr., Dr. Alon Antebi<//Text>

I have been seeing Dr. Thomas Nasser for 13 months, he is the best pain management Dr. I have ever had the pleasure of being a patient of,my doc, he is very special, he will go to any lengths to take care of you, His staff, all of them, are a very special group of young people, I say young people because they are all, extremely accommodating, every member of the AVORS staff, always have smiles on their faces, they go to great lengths to make sure that you are being cared for, from the rope at the front desk. to the young lady who asks you about your pain level, and how well your medicine is working,and rest assured that Dr. Nasser asks all the same questions, it's like there is no way way to miss something, the staff are extremely knowledgable about pain medicine, and what works well with what, no stone goes uncovered, if these people don't have the answer they will get you the answer, quickly.
I could go on and on, just 1 more example of how much Dr. Nasser cares, he talks to you not at you, Even during the worst of Covid, Dr. Nasser would put out his hand,shake your hands and smile,I came to Dr.Nasser, from a doctor,who was all about the money, not my Dr. Nasser, he's all about his patients, I have never seem him lose it with a patient, his smile truly warms the room. You be sure, your going to get the very best level of care, need him at night, just call, it might not be Nasser himself but the doctor cares just as much, he takes time with you, you never feel rushed, everyone in this group is splendid, the girls who make your appointments to the ones that call in your meds, rest assured you are in great hands, his impish smile, goes a long way with me, he puts so much time into the time,he,cares, really cares, he will go the extra 10 miles, he is just a true old fashioned Doctor, who lets you know he can be trusted, so give my doc a try,what do you have to lose, he's just awesome, and easyhe's married .to a lady that works 1 floor up, I can't wait to meet her, she's going to go the extra mile just like Dr. Nasser, I can't wait to meet her but in the mean time, I can rest assured.the male dr Nasser

The whole team is without issue, they will take excellent care of you, go the extra mile

Doctor Tommy is one of the best Doctors I've ever come to know.. I'm not just saying this cause we are both from back east.. every time I been admitted to the hospital he personally came to see me and take care of me. His heart is kind and I truly believe he took his oath to help people.. I wish I could BBQ with him. Hes the kinda guy you wanna be friends with outside of his work.. 2 thumbs up for him 4 thumbs if you wear glasses .. lol.

I get such good concern, respect and care when I go to Doctor Smith. He is an extremely knowledgable and experienced Chiropractor. He definitely knows how to treat my concerns and get my body functioning very well again. I had a very good Chiropractor before I moved to AV. I’ve seen chiropractors who don’t treat thoroughly. Also a chiropractor who used scare tactics to try to schedule more visits than necessary. Doctor Smith is very sincere and honest in his care and concern. Thank you for your knowledge and experience and values, Doctor Smith.</text>

<Review>I love this medical group! The staff is always friendly, and professional. Bri was awesome, and was very gentle when she took out my 31 staples. She is a great nurse, and I am thankful I had her for that procedure. Dr. Antebi has been wonderful. He is straight forward, took his time answering all my questions. I can tell he genuinely wants the best outcome possible for his patients, and I truly appreciate his work ethic. I would HIGHLY recommend AVORS!🏆<//Review>< pics>

<text>I did not have a personal doctor in the area and was having considerable shoulder pain.  A friend referred me to Dr Sherfey.

All the Doctor's and staff are awesome! I'm honored to be a patient of Thomas Nasser who has helped me in my long battle with RA and Osteoarthritis. He has been able to give me facet blocks which has aided in pain relief. Also Dr. Antebi is great as well his work with my knees has helped in giving me back my mobility.☺☺<//Review>

Absolutely the best top-notch orthopedic physicians available.  Dr. Antebi very expertly and quickly  diagnosed the cause of the excruciating  pain I had been suffering with. (This was after one week of pure agony and a night in the ER on morphine with numerous tests being done.)  One carefully positioned steroid shot and 15 minutes later I finally felt the pain beginning to fade away.  I have just seen Dr. Antebi for my 4 week follow up appointment.  He was very kind and pleased that the steroid shot had worked for me.  He assured me if the pain were to return he would be happy to help me again. I feel very satisfied with the treatment I received and the level of concern and comfort Dr. Antebi provided.< /review>

Second DR Nasser  oh my god we're do I start. I started going to avors because I couldn't get answers from the VA. I got a referral to avors. I'm a really picky person when it comes to drs. ( I have had really bad experiences in the past) my first day there DR Nasser walked in and had the biggest smile and the most soothing personality, never in my life have I had a dr that has been so intuitive and listens. I have been going to avors for 7 months now and I have found the best dr I could find it has truly been a blessing. I have answers I have been looking for finally after 5 years of no diagnosis. Dr Nasser is the real deal and I would recommend him any day. Don't hesitate to go see him he's a blessing and has changed my out look on my life. I finally have relief. Thank you avors and Dr Nasser< /review>< Gmap_id>

They have been providing me with the highest quality care and helping me with my carpal tunnel, cubital tunnel, and most recently 3 fractured bone 🦴 chips in 2 fingers (R Index x2 + R Middle x1) Dr. Heller is Amazing 😉!!! Dr. Nasser is THE BEST PAIN MANAGEMENT Dr. I HAVE EVER BEEN TO and has been treating my Pain in my Neck Fusion with an Implanted Morphine Pump for almost 5 Years but overall has been treating me for over a decade!!! Dr. Nasser is NOT LIKE “Pill Pusher Doctors” because he Truly Cares about helping people with pain feel better and live better lives through the watchful supervision of their unique pain management needs & Dr. Nasser is also NOT like some Dr.’s who don’t want to give people any pain meds because they are too over cautious about potential abuse issues, because Dr. Nasser is willing to do what he determines a patients needs are and use all available tools to help people live better lives through Actively Managed Pain Care!!!</Text>< Pics>

We saw Dr. Entebe  at AVORS Medical Group.  The visit went well and we were satisfied with the expediency of the visit and the answer to our questions. An Appointment was set for our future procedure and we will tell more after that procedure has been done.  So far we are very satisfied with the office staff and doctors.</text>

<Review>I had my right hip replaced by Dr.Antebi on May 8th, as an outpatient, and was able to walk without assistance upon awakening.  Of course I did have some pain, which is normal.  I went home, followed my instructions for physical therapy, in addition to walking every day.  The only experience I ever had that was better was in 2016 when Dr. Antebi replaced my left hip, because at that time I had such a high tolerance to pain I only felt minimal, if any pain, right after the surgery.</Review>< pics>

I see dr Nasser for my pain management. He is great! I couldn’t ask for another a better dr. The one thing that bothers me is the amount of time you have to wait in the waiting room. This needs to be addressed.< /review>

Do not go here! The surgery schedulers told me my portion for the bill was zero and now have to pay almost 500.00.  They are sorry for me being misinformed but oh well.  The scar is also not the way Dr Heller said it would look! Beware!< /Review>

I have been with Dr. Nasser for many years now I will guess maybe 10 years approx. Dr. has treated me the best he can for my condition after my 5 surgeries by other Dr's in which the last had done 3 surgeries to getting it completed with pain why I see  Dr. Nasser for relief without major reconstruction because of Cages placed in Lumbar area.

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>I have been with this Medical Office for over a year now. I no longer dread seeing my Doctor. Every Employee that I have had contact with has been a pleasure. Very kind & professional. After check in while waiting for my Doctor I listen to the Staff outside & I marvel at how happy & cheerful they sound. It says alot to hear the happy Staff because that tells me they have a great Supervisor that they work for. I also hear other People who are waiting for the Doctor complain about the wait time. I know being in pain is unpleasant but my Doctor takes the complaining in stride and is cheerful and upbeat always. I am treated with respect & compassion. The goal is always to get me healed and moving forward in my Health. The plan is discussed, agreed to and very encouraging. From the time of arrival the first impression is welcoming & warm. Check in & taken to the back I am always asked "How are you today?" And that's not just a standard greeting. They really want to know! And upon conclusion, making my next appointment I am asked what works best for MY schedule?  Yes I reccomend this Company. Be prepared to wait a little time. Enjoy the T.V's in the Waiting room or enjoy a magazine or book. It is worth the wait.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Thomas Nasser is an amazing doctor and a God when it comes to taking pain away and getting you fixed. Extremely professional and would recommend him to anyone with life debilitating injuries and pain. I would give him 10 stars if I could.</Text>

Definitely need to be your own advocate. Make sure all relevant staff from DOs to Med techs etc know history & You know benefits & limits of your medical insurance. Very good with accessing Medicare benefits to get best treatments & medicines like Botox paid for by Medicare!! Family First Med Group cover ped-geriatric  associated & share info including pre-op testing as coordinated effort. W AVORS practice on first floor w carpal tunnel surgery ,  pain management & rehab both practices n communication at their best.</review>

My moms dr works very hard trying to offer her many things to improve her life. She does not always show the desire to exercise but wants to do something. I just have not found what besides the kitchen. Shes a great cook, but im afraid she'll knock the pot down on herself, so i offer exercise to help her to stand when she has to stir food on stove. Were stuck at trying to do exercises.                           You guys are great only once in awhile the super long wait kills her. She gets very uncomfortable in chair for over 30 mon.  Thanks so much for your help with her issues and pain.🙂</Review>

<text>I will be forever grateful. To Dr. Antebi who  went out of his way to perform a badly needed bilateral knee replacement  under constrictive time and pressure by my insurance coverage. His work is unbelievable! I was able to walk 40 feet 12 hours after the surgery was done without pain. I am truly  amazed by his work.
I know this is hard to believe, but I had witness one of his patients right after surgery who claimed to be pain free after undergoing the same procedure. Truly remarkable.< /text><user_id>103328171946404894945<//user_id><rating>5< /rating>< response>

<GmapID>0x80c25a48b349141d:0x48e43527f114071a<//GmapID><text>This is a place to avoid like the plague. I went there after a fall at my house to find out if that fall had effected my hip implant. First I waited for a long time to see a doctor, then he was very rush-rush to get done with me and his recommendation was "Don't fall that often" as I had one other fall before the one where I mostly got my spine hurt. Obviously I had to see another orthopedic surgeon, so this was a complete waste of time.
And now imagine - they charged me nearly $800 for it! I requested a justification of the cost because $800 for 10 minutes makes an hourly rate of $4800 and that seemed a bit stiff. They were completely unresponsive - never heard from them and I thought there was some reasonable behavior on their side - but no - they immediately sent the amount to a collection agency which also did not react to my and my attorney's inquiries. I ended up with a bad mark on my credit report by these crooks.
Avoid at all costs.< /text>< Date>

<username>Jason King</username><date>1561498659051<//date><rating>5</rating><Review>Myah* the friendly nurse... Dr. Nasser is a great Dr. Providing 5 star care, but I would like to describe my experience with Myah.

I have been dealing with chronic pain, pain managment, pharmacies, insurance companies and doctors offices staffs for about 5 years now, and Dr. Nasser and his staff "is second to none" truly the best in all they do, they have been my care provider since Aug 2016. Behind every great physician is a greater staff, Myah the call nurse is the saint that handles issues that patients may have outside regular scheduled appointments. If you have an issue and call in this is where your call is transferred to.  While being on suboxone I have had several occasions where I had issues with refills I.e needed prior approvals, needed early refill due to fear of running out while on travel, ive had issues with my insurance, and several times I procrastinated  making my follow up Appointments that would put me in jeopardy of running out of my medication before I could be seen. And every time I called on her for help she has always responded back within the hour or at the next business day at the latest with good news... If you have an opioid dependency or have ever been on an opioid medication then you can understand the anxiety that you experience when running out of meds when you are on vacation or when on travel for work. But unlike my past experiences with other health care providers of being treated like a junkie and getting the run around or Just getting the infamous sacastic " sorrry but there is nothing I can do"..  Well when dealing with Myah that is never the case she has always, "Quickly" responded to my requests and made every effort to reslove the issue and get answers even when it was my neglegence that put me in most of my uncomfortable situations. She should be recognized for her ability and competence in medicine, and her professional conduct she always displays towards patients, treating us with dignity and respect. Thank you avors staff.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>This office needs a serious improvement on patient management.  My appointment was at 2:40 pm, came here 15 minutes early waited until 3:20 pm.  I had to complain to get in the small patient's room at 3:30 pm.  Not punctual all.  Also there were a few former patients of Dr. Sharfey, they were both complaining about their knee surgeries.  I hope he doesn't screw up my arm.  Seems like all they care about dollars and cents how much they can squeeze out of.  It's now 3:42 pm yet to see the actual doctor.  One hour from my scheduled appointment.< /Text>< response>

< review>
Dr Sherfey preformed surgery on my foot. It was severed and the chance to save my foot was slim to none. He not only was able to save and reattach my foot, I can feel and move it again.
Dr Sherfey is a master in his field and a very carting Dr. I highly recommend him!</review>

<review>My wife had shoulder surgery. We were the last one in the room. And the last to leave. Once she was done there was no one there to answer our questions about the surgery or should my wife sleep with her sling on when sleeping. The doctor seemed in a hurry once the surgery was done and barely stopped to talk to me about it. It just seemed very unprofessional.< /review><user_id>105131048568768359981< /user_id>< user_name>

<review>I don't know about the doctor but me and my husband went in for an appointment at 10:50 today and an hour and a half later we still weren't seen. My husband was in so much pain that he couldn't sit there any longer. I was so disappointed. I woke up this morning saying oh good my husband is finally going to get something done with his knee, and then he couldn't stand waiting. Why on earth would you schedule thirty to forty people at the same time?  And to top it off Dr. Antebi was supposed to be getting off work at 11:30...How on earth could he see all of them in that short of time??? They overbooked which sounds to me like they only care about the money not the patients. So depressed that my husband can't get the help he so desperately needs.</review><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My Primary Medical referred me to AVORS due to a backlog. I saw Dr. SHERFEY for my hip and he was caring, gentle, and for me in for surgery very quick. He has  been a fabulous doctor and I am very happy with the treatment of all the drs, assistants, and all my contacts at AVORS.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80c25a48b349141d:0x48e43527f114071a<//gmap_id></record>

<review>These young, AVORS doctors were enthusiastic about my health and know their stuff. I've heard people say that if they broke a bone or had any joint or spine problem they would not go anywhere else. I can see why. Highly recommended.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><userid>117270694030487886455< /userid><Gmap_id>0x80c25a48b349141d:0x48e43527f114071a<//Gmap_id><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

My experience with Dr Masih was pleasurable, however, far less could be said about the attentive nature of the staff.  First, the selection process of an "in Network" provider was not the first option provided in scheduling a medical procedure thus the consideration of the out of pocket cost to the client was not considered.  Secondly, Upon arriving at the hospital for the second procedure, the paperwork noting the procedure to be performed was not correct; the first procedure was nearly repeated if it weren't for my questioning.  Lastly, the follow up with billing inquiries is/was not processed timely.  I made several calls over a 1 week period (Sadie & Lorraine) to be told the inquiry has not been reviewed and additional time will be needed.  After 4 calls and 9 transfers Office Manager Lydia Baker advised " I am too busy to review your information and I will need to call you back" and without my acknowledgment,  the call was disconnected.  I am hugely disappointed with the level of service received as well as the competence of the staff; I found Lydia to be extremely rude and unapologetic for the delay in the response time experienced.   I would recommend increased customer service training for ALL staff members as well as a review of office procedures regarding timely follow up.< /review>

This clown scheduled me to have my pelvis removed "that's right to cut me in half and I scheduled it" I was in a car acesadent and had mersa in my pelvis the next day I cancelled the serigy and went to Keck usc I am still walking today this was 5 years ago. Don't let him touch you he cares about money and nothing else. That's why he schedules everyone at The same time.< /review>

< review>
Don't buy any prepaid plans from Tmobile. They are so irresponsible about their plan.  I had bought $60 unlimited plan ,but you can't receive calls.
And they are just collecting money.  If you are thinking to buy a plan. I wish u good luck.<//review>

They are helpful & friendly & very knowledgeable. They aren't one o f the ones that can repair your phone as they don't have techs on site, was referred to the Elk Grove store. However they knew what was wrong with my phone.👍🏼😊<//text>

The staff was polite. They gave me instructions on discounts available to me and in general. It was kind of packed when I got there but I cleared up within about 30 minutes. The locations is easy to spot from the road and parking is ample. I wish the lay out felt more visually appealing but it was a nice experience.</Review>

Every time I go into this store I'm immediately greeted and assisted by the wonderful employees at this location. The camera on my G4 stopped working suddenly and Sean was able to get it working again. His friendly demeanor and willingness to help not only me, but the other customers, is what makes his customer service stand out. I recommend the Florin store for anyone that has Sprint service.<//Text>

My only issue with the sprint stores is, it seems that the sprint stores that I've been to do not have restrooms. But the wait at this location is always very short. Johnny, Shawn, Henry & Robin are great. They all are very helpful, knowledgeable and skilled. The staff here always seems so friendly and willing to help. Thanks guys.<//Text>

Had to go to a different sprint store cause the first one the computer didn't like my info and refused to do my credit check, but the next sprint did just fine. It took a bit but the guys at the Florin rd location near southgate were great. They tried really hard to find me the best deal to get an S10 cheaply. Even tried to convince me to chose a different phone for even more savings and I almost did went as far as choosing case and screen protector, but I'm too big a Samsung fan I started to go into withdrawals. LOL I went with the 10e to save a bit.<//review>

<Text>Went to the Sprint store on Florin with my moms couple days ago, when we got to the store it was completely dead like I literally thought they were closing but the 2 people that were working was real proactive about helping us even though it was near 8pm when they weren't even close to closing but the guy that helped us was Henry Gomez, in the 7 years I've been with Sprint he's probably the best store level rep we've dealt and did business with, his professionalism had us dumbfounded and we left the store happier than a kid having ice cream for the first time.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

The worst. Was not greeted or acknowledged. The only 2 reps were so engrossed in making a sale that they completely disregarded the 5 people waiting in line. After 30 mins or so, myself and another customer walked out.< /text>

Had a terrible experience here. From day one they did not have our account correct. So each month thereafter it continued to be incorrect. This meant, having to explain the situation, again and again, to whoever was accepting my payment that month. Apparently, it was much too difficult to just correct the original error in the computer.< /text>

<review>Had a very knowledgeable and super friendly gentleman help get my phone activated and help us get a new tablet.  He was engaged in the conversation and heart service above making sales and commission. He also interacted with my children in a way that impressed my husband and I. He answered quite a few questions I've had regarding my Google photos and phone storage and was just eager to help us in any way he possibly could.  I am extremely appreciative and feel that he is a prize employee.  I wish I could remember his name...  I would encourage you to stop by.

Okay,  so update on 10/5/2018
So I have returned a couple of times after purchasing multiple devices from this location and  been helped by the same person who sold me those devices and my opinion  Has changed. My opinion is this, this particular location is particularly focus on sales and sales only. I found that the employees here  Lack knowledge regarding simple   Tech issues. With this came a very different attitude, disregarding the genuine importance of  customer service.  I highly recommend you visit the you Sprint on Laguna Boulevard for any technical issues.<//review><Gmap_id>0x809ac52de1b703cd:0x6a9cbf3480a90855<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My Samsung S7 was not receiving phone calls and I had called numerous times 800 number for Sprint and Samsung to see if they knew what I could do to fix it they had given me different options to use it on safe mode to restart it to factory reset it and nothing work I wouldn't receive calls so I finally got tired of dealing with it since I'm under contract took it in the girl just updated the network settings and the phone works perfect</review>

This is worst customer service I have experienced at a Sprint Store. When we walked in there was no acknowledgement at all. We stood there and a lady who worked there wearing ripped jeans very unprofessional, was running after a child with a balloon. And then goes behind the counter and ask what brings you into to the store. We advise to upgrade our phone. Unfortunately she was being a lil smart when we asked if its going to effect our plan.  Another guy end up helping but after waiting they didnt have the phone we wanted instead of offerings other options like order the phone in the color or find another store they said sorry. I end up having to call another Sprint Store off Elk Grove Florin and spoke Ray who was very pleasant and said without hesitation come over we can help you.

WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION.< /text>

<review>Don’t ever come here!!! They will scam you and make you pay money you shouldn’t!!! Came to add a line and the employee demetrius said I had to pay 140 down. I’ve never had to pay a downpayment when adding a line only the activation fee. I changed my mind and was going to do it online and he said since I signed it was to late. I knew he was lying. I argued that I shouldn’t be paying for a downpayment and he said it was taxes and the activation fee, but I would get a case and screen protector for free, another lie. He dropped it down to 120, then 75 then 65. Like how even.???? So I ended up paying 65. He basically robbed me!! I asked for the receipt and literally the receipt says he charged me for the case on the phone. These people are liars for they can get commission on a sale. They will lie and say your paying taxes for the phone but no that is not true! They are using that money to go towards their accessorie sales! That’s why you get a free case or whatever. I will be returning tomorrow for my refund. 😒 don’t let these people scam you. Always ask for your receipt right when it prints out!!!!!</review>< Pictures>

<review>Don't go here.  They run a scam about giving you "free" accessories instead of charging you the sales tax on the phones.  You don't pay sales tax up front on leased phones IT IS INCLUDED IN YOUR MONTHLY BILL.  PLEASE DO NOT BE TAKEN IN BY THESE A HOLE SCAMMERS.  They should be locked up for fraud!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809ac52de1b703cd:0x6a9cbf3480a90855</GmapID></record>

<review>Don’t ever come here!!! They will scam you and make you pay money you shouldn’t!!! Came to add a line and the employee demetrius said I had to pay 140 down. I’ve never had to pay a downpayment when adding a line only the activation fee. I changed my mind and was going to do it online and he said since I signed it was to late. I knew he was lying. I argued that I shouldn’t be paying for a downpayment and he said it was taxes and the activation fee, but I would get a case and screen protector for free, another lie. He dropped it down to 120, then 75 then 65. Like how even.???? So I ended up paying 65. He basically robbed me!! I asked for the receipt and literally the receipt says he charged me for the case on the phone. These people are liars for they can get commission on a sale.

First you put your name on a list, wait, wait more. They call your name, find out purpose for your visit, then make you wait, wait more, wait, wait, wait wait.  I went in for a replacement sim card on an existing account. It took 2 hours with only one person in front of me.<//review>

Awful. Terrible customer service and there is always a long wait!! Horrible staff do not even acknowledge you as a customer. Do yourself a huge favor and just go to a different location. Sprint needs to just close this location. Please just throw the whole store away!!</text>

We enjoy eating out. Yesterday we  found this fine restaurant which we didn’t know before. We passed a lovely experience there with fine food and  an experienced crew and a distinguished  chef. We put this place in our phone list  and we will no doubt come back very soon.  Highly recommended.<//text>

<Text>Disappointing. Lived by this place for many years and finally gave it a shot. Everything was ho hum to bleh. The baked muscles were fishy and for our last roll we were served what I've uploaded in my photo. It's like they just gave up. Our spicy salmon roll never came out, but we were done at that point and had the waiter cancel the order. Should of known when the table next to us left a massive amount of uneaten good when they left. I'm sticking with Ahi across the street.</Text>< user_id>

This sushi restaurant is the absolute best in the San Fernando Valley! Bar none it is the bomb dot com! The fish was very fresh,  the sushi nigiri and rolls were delicious and very artistically crafted by Japanese sushi chefs! I was very happy and full after our meal! The prices were great! $29.95 for all you can eat dinner! $19.95 for all you can eat lunch! Definitely come to Yen Sushi!!!!< /review>

Another all you can eat sushi bar with TERRIBLE QUALITY sushi. They also purposely load everything up with EXTRA EXTRA RICE so you get full fast. The sushi was so bad I didnt even order a second round and went and got 5 guys next door right after.<//Text>

<Review>This is the best sushi I have ever had.  And compared to other places the all you can eat is the most reasonable.  I used to go to another place (who for kindness sake I won't mention the name) who started raising prices like crazy!  I know times are tough, but suddenly on top of the expensive all you can eat charge if you ordered uni  or shrimp heads -- or which you were only allowed one order -- now you had to pay an extra 2 dollars!  Forget it!  When I found Yen I found not only better quality, I found lower prices, and I could order what I wanted.  They are serious about eating everything though as they are entitled to be.  My friend and I ordered too much the first time.  We had to pay extra for what we couldn't eat!  But they were extremely kind and packed it all up for us to take home.  I learned a lesson!</Review><date>1519579541229</date>< user_id>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Popcorn Lobster roll, Baked salmon roll.

They don't need any explanation other than yum.

Popcorn lobster roll is with a spicy tuna roll under. Its so good. The yellow sauce they put on it is delicious too. I know its not spicy mayo but its a good sauce. Works perfect for the roll.

Baked Salmon, melts in your mouth. I like the fact that they bake it well. Its not just torched on top. It is fully cooked.

This is my sushi spot</Text>< Pictures>

Sushi here is fresh and delicious. The baked salmon roll is so soft and moist. It came  hot (big +). Usually if I get miso soup at other places they are way to salty. This place makes it perfect. The avocado ball has spicy tuna underneath. Very good. I like the presentation of the sushi. The salmon raw pieces were really good. Very fresh.  I think this is becoming my favorite sushi joint.<//Text>

The food was so blah we went elsewhere afterwards. The consensus was that it was not worth the wait or the uncomfortably cramped dining room and the blown-out eardrums (without there even being music).< /Text>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>I went here two days ago while visiting a friend in the Long Beach area. Yen has several other locations, including the one near my home in Studio City.

The first thing I noticed when I got here was that this was a Korean owned franchise. Oh no. The menu consisted mainly of contemporary fancy rolls, as well as some other basic "Japanese" food that anybody can learn to cook really. Anyways, I gave the food a shot.

I ordered yellowtail, albacore, and spanish mackerel nigiri sushi. Then my friend got a soft shell crab and salmon roll. After having tried a piece of everything, I concluded that the food here is 3 stars. It's not bad sushi like Todai or Sushi Mac. It's even a tad better than Mon, which is another Korean owned sushi franchise. It's just not on the same freshness/taste level as Noshi Sushi, Sushi Gen, Yotsuya, or even Oomasa. The rolls themselves were just okay too.

Sure, the restaurant interior is nice, clean, and good for friendship outings. But if you want something great tasting, don't drive out of your way to eat here. It's not all that spectacular. I guess now I now how the Studio City location probably tastes like.</review>< Pictures>

We had an excellent experience with Generation Lending. We worked with Sean and Lauren on the refinance of our home and they did a great job with our loan. They were always available to answer all of my questions and took the time to explain every step of the process. I felt like I was getting the best service out there with people who actually care! The process was super smooth from start to finish. A big thanks to Sean and his team for making such a seamless transaction!< /review>

Our Lending officer, Logan, was extremely professional and stayed right with us through the entire process. He was always available to answer questions and never seemed bothered about the amount of time that we required.  I was most impressed that he knew who I was when I called I did not have to be reminded of who I was and the details of our application.   He made us feel like we were the only clients he was dealing with. We were treated as people and not as a number. We highly recommend Generation Lending and Logan specifically to anyone seeking home financing.< /text>

<text>By far the easiest and most transparent refinance we've ever had. Logan was a top notch professional. He explained everything clearly and handled the entire process with honesty and integrity. There were no surprises and no "gotchas." Lauren was equally professional and helped us navigate the processing steps with ease. Texts, emails and phone calls returned promptly and courteously. We had a small issue at closing with a typo in the paperwork and Logan took care of it instantly with no impact to our ability to close on time. Erin at Corner Escrow was also terrific.  I can't say enough good things about our experience with Generation Lending. Trust them. I'm glad I did.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We would like to say thank you to Generation Lending and especially Dillon and his team for helping us with a recent refinance of our home.  We've been through a few refinances and this time was the smoothest and easiest. Dillon led us through the process and was always in contact either by phone, email or text. We got a great interest rate and were able to pull money out of the house to build a pool. I would recommend Generation Lending to family and friends.</text>

Logan Raleigh couldn’t have been more accommodating, patient, and helpful for my first cash out refinance. Not knowing anything about the process going into it he helped me understand what and how everything is determined and why. Then took me through many possibilities of how to best proceed. So thankful for all his help!<//Review>

Shoutout to Dillon! Our first home refinance application was a success and we got it with such a breeze! We’ve been hearing it everywhere about how it’s such a good time to refinance homes with the current rates available, but I was very hesitant to go through the process since I was going through a tough time personally with my dad’s passing. I didn’t think I was ready enough to take on something as consequential as getting our home refinanced. I was getting a lot of calls but I never got convinced enough until I talked to Dillon. Dillon was very patient with all of my questions and concerns. He assured me that he will guide me throughout the process and said that he will keep me posted with everything going on with our application. When I have an undertaking, it’s very important for me that I am aware and tracking of how things are going. I get anxious when I am clueless. Fortunately I got to work with Dillon and I was very happy working with him. A lot of things came up during the application like our PACE solar loan sort of complicating things, I had to fly overseas to be with my family, etc. but Dillon dealt with it all gracefully and confidently that it encouraged confidence in me as well. The whole process I felt like My husband and I are taken cared of, we are getting the best deal we can get, and that we are in good hands-we sure were! Thank you to Dillon and Generation Lending  ❤️< /Text>

Phenomenal customer service! From the beginning to the end I was treated like a friend. Sean helped me to get the best rate possible, worked with my request and was very flexible. Everything I asked for, he went above and beyond to make it happen. He explained everything to me in detail, and helped me to be comfortable with the process. He's very patient, accommodating, warm and friendly. When my escrow closed it was everything I asked for and more.
I'm so grateful I worked with this company, and Sean is fantastic. I highly recommend them, they are great!</text>

So we immediately called him and let him know our requirements.  In less than 2 weeks, we've got everything in order and got great rates!  Transaction was so smooth, in a little over a month, we signed our closing docs!  They even sent a mobile notary to come over to our backyard and do the signing socially distanced.  Talk about convenience!  We've recommended the team to several of our friends, colleagues and they have treated everyone as a VIP!

By far my best experience working with a lender! Zack took care of us really well - super responsive, communicated everything upfront so we knew what to expect, and our entire process (from the initial meeting to funding) was well under 30 days and blew my expectations out of the water. Can't recommend more highly!<//review>

<review>My loan was funded this week and I am amazed at how very easy and quick it was. I had been working on getting my loan since August and after going through several companies I settled on Generation Lending about the middle of December.  It went so smooth especially on a VA loan we closed in about 30 days. Logan Raleigh was great and very available for questions I asked as was Lauren. I totally recommend this company to anyone looking for help getting a loan.</review>< resp>

Logan was most helpful guiding our refinance to completion. Our refinance was more difficult than most since we own multiple properties but Logan stuck with us and delivered a phenomenal loan percentage rate as promised. I would not hesitate to do business with him and Generation Lending if need be. We lowered our payment 26% !!!!< /Review>

I was contacted by a number of mortgage companies - most were typical sales people with typical sales pitch - Generation Lending was different - not pushy, just gave constructive options and let me decide at my pace - Zack was initial contact and was great with providing different opportunities - Dillon was my loan officer and he was really easy to work with and showed me that combining my two properties into one loan was the way to go - he’s truly professional and knowledgeable  - Lauren worked with us on documentation and was a really pleasure to deal with - thanks to all for an easy process!</Text>

<name>C.L. Smith</name><Review>I spoke with Dillon from Generation Lending Inc. about refinancing my home. I received calls from several lenders but for some reason, Dillon’s calls stood out to me. Dillon was very patient. He sincerely wanted to find a way to help me. Dillon answered every question that I asked. He explained the refinancing process. Even though I was unable to refinance at this time, I left the conversation feeling that Dillon did everything that he could to help me. Dillon’s honesty and trustworthiness is admirable. I would  definitely recommend Dillon and Generation Lending to my friends and family.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I worked with Kevin on my re-fi back in August 2020. Rates were very attractive but many institutions were not working on jumbos.  Kevin was able to not only secure the refi, but do so at a very attractive rate.  My situation was complex, taking much longer to close than normal, but Kevin was very professional and patient and we got it done.  I highly recommend Generation Lending.< /review>

Things went smoothly, even when they didn't. No matter what unforseen obstacles emerged before them, Sean and Lauren got my refinance done in a blink of an eye. They are an amazing team to have on your side. 100% would refinance through them again.<//Text>

Because of a past bad 1st time home loan, refi and modification experience (Bought home in 2004, refi'd in 2006, modification in 2010 - Housing Market crash era) I was leery of who to do business with.  I was referred to Generation Lending through a trusted friend and I couldn't be happier!!  I appreciated Logan's honesty and professionalism. He made me feel completely comfortable, and understood how my previous experiences made me cautious. I appreciated Logan's patience with my many questions, as well as his clear explanations.  Thanks again, Logan and Lauren!</text>

After waiting for over a year with a different banking agency to refinance our loan I contacted Mr. Wiseman and started the transaction and in less than 2 months and very smooth dealing with Lauren  and Sean we got the great news that our loan had been funded. Unbelievable! Thank You. Juan J.< /Text>

<review>I was a sceptic, to say the least! I filled out one of those online questioners to "just see" what interest rate I could get. I was at a 4%, which isn't terrible but lets be real, I was seeing rates under 3% and even under 2%!! I thought, I can use that extra money!! So, I kid you not, I got probably 100 calls from various Lending companies. It became a super annoyance! However, I tried to be polite and listen. Zack Neelands from Generation Lending happen to be of these calls. For some reason he seemed like less pressure, or kinder or maybe authentic. Not really trying to sell as much as educate. He was so patient with me and my serious issue of not trusting and being afraid of my identity being compromised. After only a few hours of gathering information, wheels were rolling! He took me step by step through this process! I was approved for the loan within just a few short weeks and I had everything wrapped up and received some cash and a rate of 2.375% for a 15 year fixed! And, best of all, my payment was lower. I was really pleased with my experience! Thank you Zack! You have changed my image of what a re-finance looks like!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1612545356855, 'text': 'Wow!!

<review>I've done a few refi's of my home over the years and the people at Generation Lending are easily the best I've ever worked with. If you can, ask to work with Sean Wiseman and Lauren Schiebler. Both of them were super responsive to my many questions and they helped me through the whole process seamlessly.
Even in times where interest rates are constantly changing, these guys got me a great deal and locked me in at an awesome rate. I compared their fees to many others as well and they were way more affordable too.
I'm self employed and anyone who works for themselves and has tried to get a loan before knows it can be a nightmare trying to prove income and assets. Generation Lending made it easy and our refi sailed through without a hitch.
Don't waste time calling around to a bunch of other companies who are going to spam call for the next 3 months after asking for a quote. Make your life easier and just go with Sean and Lauren at Generation Lending.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My husband & I had been wanting to refinance our house, so I went on line to check it out. I got a ton of calls & texts! When I read the one that James sent, it just clicked to me. He said that they were a small family run business & to give them a chance. Well, I did & I’m sooo happy that I did. Everyone there is sooo knowledgeable, helpful, professional, nice & pleasant! Logan handled everything so well that the process was absolutely Painless! Lauren was also wonderful. Right on top of every detail. I wish more businesses were like Resi Central Mortgage Co. (General Leading) I’ve refinanced many of my homes & it’s never been so easy & stress free! Thank you, again for making the process so easy! 👍🏻👏🏻👍🏻👏🏻

My wife and I were able to get a fantastic rate and low cost for our refi with Generation Lending! Cost, however, is not the only factor: Refinancing can be stressful, but the process was made extremely simple and easy to navigate by Kevin and Heather. Not only was everything communicated clearly and efficiently from our quote to doc signing, it was fast - We are so grateful to the team for a painless experience!< /Review>

<review>Kevin Brown and his team made the refinancing of my home loan very smooth, simple and quick.  The refinancing from start to close took less than 20 business days!!  I was able to get a 2.375%  APR  and a lower house payment of $115.00 per month which is exactly what I wanted.  I WILL NEVER HAVE TO REFINANCE AGAIN THANKS TO GENERATION LENDING INC. !!!!

< review>
I had applied for a home refi at large lender. When I received a phone call from Generation Lending's Logan I was impressed by his sincerity and good things to say about dealing with his company which is local. I was especially interested as the other company's reputation was for a slow process to close being overwhelmed by the volume of applications. I had a bigger need to close sooner and Logan promised me a much faster closing. He also discussed he worked with the loan processor, Lauren, at the next desk over so there were always two people available for help. I found this to be true and am impressed with how helpful and quickly they got back to me. With the other company, when I tried to contact the loan processor with a question I never heard back. I found it easy to back out of the other application with one exception. I called the Loan Officer I originally dealt with to cancel. I asked him if I needed to write a letter as follow-up and he told me he would take care of it. Well he never did and that caused me some minor issues that I was able to deal with. Everything that Logan committed to came through, great follow-up, answered all my questions and we closed in the time frame he had indicated they could meet. They both made the process relatively painless and smooth. I have done many re-fi's in the past and I think this was the best. You can put your trust in them and the company they represent.<//review>

I had already started a Refinance application with someone else and was receiving solicitations from 6 or 8 other broker.  Something in his message struck chord.  It was simple and sincere.  I decided to call back.  He understood what I needed and provided a few options.  Worked to find me the lowest rate and best program and I am very happy with what I received and with the service I got from Generation Lending and Kevin.  I had many questions and he addressed them all to my satisfaction.  The home loan industry is, well, complicated.  A few things generated several questions but Kevin was patient to explain and stand by his quotes.  I appreciated that very much. We closed the loan in about 6 weeks.  Highly recommended!< /Review><rating>5</rating>< name>

<Text>Everyone says 'my guy is the best' when it comes to lending.  I have performed countless real estate lending transactions, none of which were overly impressive until NOW.  I can honestly say that Kevin and his team ARE THE BEST.  I have referred Generation Lending to several friends, and they all shared the same thoughts.  Its rare to find a company that cares so much and actually puts the customer first the entire time.
Closing was on time and as expected.  No funny business, no games, no drama.  My rate is so good I will likely never refi again, but we will surely use Kevin and his team on any new loans.</Text>< Pics>

Great professional detailed experience with this broker.  Zack Neelands took excellent and personal care of my refinance from start to finish, making a solution from every hurdle we needed to clear.  Outstanding.  I will use Generation Lending again and recommend Zack as the point of contact.  I am very pleased with the result.  Others promised and advertised, Generation Lending Inc. delivered and in a very pleasant way during this health and economic crisis!  5 Stars All The Way!< /Review>

Dillon was great to work with. I had been dealing with 2 other lenders and found them unresponsive and inundated me with duplicate paperwork requests.
Dillon delivered beautifully with no hassle. Would highly recommend to people

Zach Neeland "rescued" me from a horribly slow re finance process that I had got bogged down in, with another company. It was taking MONTHS and also not even a good rate. Zach wisked in, we closed in about 30 days and got me an amazing 2.99% rate, saving me a good chunk of change each month. This included rolling in Parent Plus School loans, so I am very grateful and would recommend them highly.  Very professional, timely, responsive, courteous and considerate of my time.

< review>
My applying for a refinance mortgage with Generation Lending was a pleasant experience. I personally dealt with Kevin Brown and whatever he said he would do relating to the loan was kept. If I questioned anything and felt something needed to be changed or corrected it was accomplished immediately.  I would definitely recommend Generation Lending Inc to anyone wanting to refinance or if a loan was needed to purchase a home. This company certainly was reliable, and I would not hesitate to use them again.<//review>

I can definitely recommend the team at Generation Lending. They were able to complete our refi in a matter of a few weeks, and at a great rate.
Check them out and you will see why they are 5 star rated.</text>

I had been shopping around for refinance rates for my home and three rental properties. I was trying to get some of the big box loan companies to take all four of my loans and give me a good rate, but I kept getting the runaround. When I contacted Kevin at Generation Lending he gave me a great quote and told me he could handle all four simultaneously, No Problem.

Let me tell you what.
Kevin handled the whole process Beautifully. Not only did he get it all done like promised, but he got me through four refinances easier than any single refi. I have ever done before. Kevin is a true professional, he made the process so easy! and not only that, he is one heck of a nice guy!

In the future I will definitely use Generation Lending for my mortgage finance needs!

Thanks Kevin!

Hands down the BEST experience working with Generation Lending. Kevin knows his business and worked through my refi with ease and speed. Start: 7/15, funded 8/18.

<Text>For several months, we have searched for the right lender for a VA refinance lender. The day I first talked to Kevin Brown, I knew we had found the right person. He was very knowledgeable, friendly and easy to work with.. From application to signing was just two weeks! And the biggest surprise was that our rate was lowered to 2.875% two days before closing, and our new house payment is $340 a month less.
We highly recommend Kevin and his team. They are a family owned business and their service is excellent.

< Review>
I was shopping around for a company to refinance my VA Loan. After talking with a few companies who pressed really hard any and all of their military affiliations and played up their love for service members Kevin was the first one who, while appreciative or our military, treated me like a normal human being and didn't try to pander to my experience in order to make the sale. He was incredibly easy to work with, very responsive, knowledgeable, and helped in getting the best deal regardless of his commissions. Highly Recommend to anyone looking for an honest partner in the process.< /Review>

Daniel and I, thank you so very much for all of your help in securing our refinance loan during this very difficult time of the COVID pandemic.  You were organized, thorough & professional, as well as kind which made all of the difference in my interaction with you.  We put our trust in you and you most definitely came through for us.  Thank you for your patience as well as treating us as people rather than just home loan customers. You stand above the rest, Dillon!  I will recommend you to every person I know who is in need of financing.

We were there today. It's a huge retirement community , with very neat grounds. Lots of nicely built apartments. Also an  assisted living area. It has a beauty shoppe, huge dining area, exercise room, plenty of nice clean setting rooms for the patients. Three meals a day . Nice clean rooms with big screen color tvs, pretty setting areas outside , closed in for safety . It's a great place for people who want to live in an apartment , or in the assisted living building .<//text>

The staff have activities scheduled that patients can sign up to do at will. The food is good, the rooms are clean, and the patients needs and wants are #1.

Stay Away from this Batteries Plus Store, they did a phone repair and the repair damaged my phone and they now refuse to honor the warranty. Since this is a franchise owned store the corporate office is unable to help out.</Text>

Any type of battery needed you can find at this location on North Broadway and Grant Street in Santa Maria. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. Cell phone batteries, rechargeable batteries, batteries for cars and scooters too. Lots of parking and very visible from the main road.< /Review>

Went in to get battery replaced on key chain power door lock control. The guys in there were great. They got me fixed up quick & on my way.
They have a great selection for so many different applications. I'm sure that they would  be able to take care of your battery or bulb needs<//text>

Went to buy new batteries for a power chair, belonging to my wife's Uncle. I also purchased a   replacement battery that provides backup power to my garage door opener so I can still get in and out of my garage when the power goes during a storm,  etc.
Duracell power and quality at a price much cheaper than if I could have been able to buy it from my former place of employment, Botta's Garage Door Service/Roman Doors, that I worked for 30 years.
Batteries Plus is the place to get batteries for you car keys, garage door opener remote controls, replacement back up batteries for your DC garage door opener and so much more!!<//text>

<text>He has everything.  I went in thinking I would have to order batteries for my twins ride on toys.  Not the typical size, but he had them.  Since they are ride on toys, connections are soldered.  He had an iron hot and ready.  Prices can't compete with the internet, but when you want or need something today to keep the wife happy.  This is your place.< /text><Rating>5< /Rating>< Time>

Got my Samsung s8 plus replaced and the screen they sold me in the store is so cheap and maybe a refurbish. End up paying 260 for a service I should have got at Samsung store better and wait a week to get it back. I went to ask them if they can replaced it with another one and they where like some screens just comes with some defects. I guess I shouldn't recommend these place for any android users. But for an iPhone I think it's a good place.<//text>

The most recent arrangement was beautiful, as always with San Jose Flowers. They added tulips and delivered the flowers in the morning, both of which were extra requests from me.

These guys are seriously the best! I have used San Jose Flowers several times and plan to continue to do so as often as possible. Thank you for helping make my GF's birthday a special one. (PS: Apologies for the poor lighting, clutter, etc. in the photo. The flowers were even more lovely in person.)<//review>

This is my go-to flower shop on every given day. The standard of their flowers, bouquet arrangements, and floral stand are all outstanding. There are a variety of flower types to choose from. You can also customize it to your preferences. They're still in charge of shipping, which is fast and effective. It comes with a strong recommendation!< /text>

I went to visit my cousin on Tuesday and wanted to gift her a bouquet. I happened to pass by your flower shop on my way to work. I was overjoyed when your workers welcomed me with such lovely and fragrant roses. My cousin was astounded by the lovely bouquet. It was an incredible experience!</Text>

I went this place to purchase a floral arrangement, and I ask the attendant  to make a fresh  arrangement   because  they had  some already  made and I didn't  want  to take some of the because  I wasn't  sure how long will last. So I ask for a new  one. But after two days some of the  leaves  that came in the arrangement  started  dying.  So I thought  I have purchased  afres flowers.  May be they  just keep this flowers  for longer  time than they supost to have.  Some flowers just die  right  after the sale because  they are to old.  Definitely  not a good experience.</review>

The flowers I received from this flower shop are very beautiful! The instructions they have to keep the flowers alive is very clear and easy to follow. Their staves were also very kind and professional while answering my concerns. What a nice service, guys! I will never forget to recommend your flower shop to everyone!< /Text>

The only flower shop in town that offers varieties of fresh flowers every day. They also do deliveries in some areas. Yesterday, I called them ordered a bouquet of roses for my grandmother for her birthday. They delivered it on time and my grandma loved it very much. Thanks for the hassle-free order, sir! Highly recommended!<//text>

I bought my mom a bouquet here last weekend. The best thing about this flower shop is that they do deliveries, too. I called them and asked to deliver the flowers for my mom. They had the most and affordable set of arrangements than any other flower shop in the city. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

<Text>My mom truly loved the beautiful flowers that I bought for her to put in their base, and I thank this shop for that. As I went to their place yesterday, the florist was very entertaining and helpful to me. Besides, their place was captivating, for it was clean, smelled great, and flowers were well-arranged and fresh. As a satisfied customer, rating you a 5-stars makes me happy.

A family member recently had her baby and due to Covid we can’t visit, so I thought of sending her flowers. I immediately looked on google and this location was 5 min away so why not try it . I called and was told they would send me pictures. I sent them something I was looking for and they told me they would put something together and when they sent me the picture they went above and beyond of what I was expecting! I absolutely loved them , they worked with my budget, and the delivery was fast! I definitely recommend this place !<//review>

Well-known flower shop in our area! I was feeling delighted when I ordered you a bulk of flowers for my mother's birthday party. I thanked your staff for giving me those fresh flowers, and for telling me some tips on how to decorate. You are the best among the rest, guys! You are highly recommended!</Review>

There was a slight issue with what I ordered and what was delivered.  I called and requested a redo and they did so without hesitation and delivered the same day.  Excellent customer service and the second delivery was spot on.  I can trust a business who will make it right no matter what.</Text>

I wanted my bouquet to come with two more Lilies than the standard bouquet so I paid $25 dollars more to upgrade it to the “deluxe” version which the employee said would come with those extra lilies. I also paid extra so it could arrive with a balloon. It was my mother’s birthday so I wanted it to be special. However, when it arrived it came with the same number of lilies as the standard and no balloon. When I called for the refund of the extra lilies and balloon the owner told me no. He said if he were to refund me for the lilies I paid for he would go back to my moms house and get the flowers back!! What the hell??? So disrespectful. I had never encountered anyone so rude and stubborn.<//Review>< gmapID>

It's 1130am and realized it was my gf's birthday and needed to send a bouquet to her work, like NOW! The lady on the ph was nice, took my order, wanted to text me a pix of the flowers, and was able to have it delivered by 5pm today. WIN/WIN- great place!!< /review>

Ordered on 9th of Feb for Valentines. Waited all day for delivery. Tried calling only for a voicemail to say they weren't accepting calls since they couldn't take more orders... eh, what about your customers who have paid for an order already? Then emailed asking when the delivery would be WITH the order number only to recieve 'order for who?'. 2 emails sent after this and none recieved, they clearly have no care for customers. Wife comes home from work at 4.30/5pm, still no flowers... you guys had 5 days notice! Not even a notification saying they could be delivered later so I wasted my day. The flowers arrived at 8.20, by which time my wife had fallen asleep from her long day at work. Poor delivery guy wasn't central to the company so probably got the brunt of it from customers like me who were a bit miffed to say the least. Flowers were good but Valentines flowers are for when your other half comes home from work, they are not to be delivered after say 5pm (unless you order the day before or something). 5 days notice and you deliver flowers well after the sun has gone down? Ridiculous, it's a joke. Now seeing a review from someone a few years back saying they recieved theirs at 9pm. Haven't learned. Good luck growing your business if this is your attitude.</Review>

< review>
A great place that I’d highly recommend to anyone, they helped me out so much, with my corneal transplant, my contact lenses, prescriptions, and my exams, Dr. David Kaye and Dr. Paz were both really great(every Doctor was but I mostly met up with the aforementioned ones)their Assistant Brandon was also really knowledgeable and a great assistant, every one their helped me recover my vision, the facility was always really clean, and followed CDC guidelines. Overall I had great experiences here!< /review>

Very professional .I appreciate Dr Paz . Very kind and explains in detail so I can understand what's going on with my eyes . The girls at the front desk are kind and very thorough. Salena who works in the frames and your prescription is so kind and very patient . She's also very funny . I would definitely recommend Natural Vision .<//Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>My sister had eye surgery on a Wednesday and her discharge instructions were to notify doctor if  specific thing's occurre. Saturday morning swelling of the eye was one of the thing's listed to contact doctor if occurred. I called the number on the discharge summary and found there is not a doctor on call for weekend's and you would have to go to a ER. This is not acceptable with all that is taking place with a cumunicable virus running rampant and how often would a ER dept have a retina specialist available on duty? There should be a alternative to
post surgery weekend distress if you need a doctor..
Sincerely MAB
PS Great Doctor as to knowledge 👍</Text>< pics>

First of all I would like to thank  Doctor David B. Kaye and Doctor Paz from NATURAL VISION  from Fresno and Sanger CA.. About 27 years ago, I needed a Corneal transplant  and I found the great eye doctor ever Doctor Ksye . He perform  the transplant.  I was very pleased of the outcome. Though many years I have always  have had different issues with my eyes doctor Kaye has always been my eye doctor  for many years. I never wanted to see any other  eye doctor. I have been really happy with doctor Kaye. He has always helped me no matter what issue I have had.  Currently about 3 weeks ago doctor Kaye also performed  a Toric  Lens for a cataract removal.  Outcome really happy with that surgery. I also had met Doctor Paz years ago do to eye infections. He is also wonderful and concerned about my eye issues  just like Doctor Kaye. They both are the BEST EYE DOCTORS  ever. I Highly Recommend  them both  for any eye issues you may endure.  Thank you to both Doctors  for all your help.  I will always and continue to see either doctor. I thank God  for them both .   Thank you Tina Hernandez<//text>

<review>They didn’t want to help my son after he has been a patient with them they did eye surgery on him and left him worse than before. She said she would refer me to a pediatric eye doctor and didn’t do it. She got paid for not seeing my son! They didn’t care about him and not to mention I had to wait 8 months for them to see him because they kept rescheduling kids should be a priority. They disgust me and hope no one else has to deal with what I had to today!</review>< pictures>

Me and my wife have been patient’s of Dr David Kaye  for 20 years.  My wife had dry eye syndrome and lost her left eye  cornea.
He worked diligently and with persistence  to fix her eye.
Glad to say that her eye is improving and her sight is coming back. She was ready to quit but he kept trying.
His clinical skills, surgery skills, bedside manner, and personal skill are above the standard.
I can say this because I am a RN of 50 years experience.
Thank you, Dr Kaye.
Your patients till death do us part.</Review>

After visiting two other practices in town, I finally got the proper diagnosis for my eye condition. More importantly, my vision is back and now I can actually help my kids with their homework again. I don't know if they're happy about that, but I am! Dr. Kaye knows his stuff.</text>

<Text>I was a bystander who happened to witness a handful of attitude being tossed around by the receptionist at other patients. Even ignoring that fact, while reviewing this place, I still give it a single star.

Aside from sitting there for way too long and waiting to see the doctor for the initial eye exam (even though we had appointments) they completely forgot about us. We sat there for over an hour waiting to be told when we could check out glasses - only to be told they are closed and to return the next day. What a waste of time.

I don't expect much coming into offices and what not, but it just doesn't seem acceptable when you're even slower then Western Dental, and that's saying something.< /Text></record>

I have been seeing Dr. Pazirandeh at Natural Vision of Fresno for almost 15 years now for my glasses and contact lenses and I could not be happier with my care! So much so, that I recently took my grandmother to Natural Vision for her eye exam after she was diagnosed with Diabetes. The staff are polite, friendly, and efficient, and all the providers I have interacted with over the years (Dr. Kaye, Dr. Nguyen, Dr. Pazirandeh, Dr. Petkar) are very professional, highly skilled and knowledgeable, and have the best bed side manners. The office manager is great, always putting patients’ well-being first. She was even able to interpret for my grandmother who only speaks  Armenian. And I want to give a special shout out to Selena and Shushanik, who ALWAYS help and guide me in picking new glasses. The experience would not be as fun without them.<//text>

I have been taking my parents to see Dr. Aryan 'Paz' Pazirandeh at Natural Vision in Fresno for over 5 years and he is one of the best doctors my parents have ever had, and they see over 10 doctors each!  Dr Paz is not only extremely knowledgeable and capable regarding his profession of optometry but has the rare ability to explain complicated procedures and concepts in clear and easy to understand terms, while still being very precise and thorough.

Although he is quite in demand and busy, Dr. Paz never lets his patients feel it and answers each and every question with a warm and friendly smile; you never feel like his foot is half way out the door.  Dr. Paz has the best chair side manner; thank you Dr. Paz for taking the time to make each visit such a pleasure!

Ophthalmologist Dr. Kaye completed cataract surgery for both my parents and is also very kind, gentle and a capable surgeon.  Thank you Dr. Kaye and the rest of the staff at Natural Vision for taking such good care of the optical needs of my parents.

As a pediatric dental specialist I have treated thousands of children over the past 15 years and I appreciate a doctor with patience, who puts the patient first.  If you are looking for an awesome optometrist for yourself, your child or a family member, look no further than Dr. Paz and Natural Vision!    Sincerely, Dr. Susie Kalinian</Text>

<review>These doctors are the worst. They failed to tell me my daughter had a rare eye condition. I found out when a medical assistant wrote the name of the condition on a post-it note for me. That was the extent of their discussion about my daughter's condition. The condition can not only lead to blindness, but it's also an indicator of a genetic syndrome. My child needed genetic testing, medically necessary dark lenses (which were refused multiple times by the optician, who blamed the doctor and insurance for her inability to find the proper code to order my child's correct prescription) screening for malignant kidney tumors and lots of other nasty things. I specifically asked Dr. Nguyen and Dr. Paz if it was a rare condition and if there was anything wrong. They both told me no, that my daughter just has very large pupils. They lied. She has no irises. When I finally found out about my daughter's condition after seeing these terrible doctors for four years, I had to find out that my daughter had potentially life threatening conditions from Google. These people need to shut down their practice. They should not be in charge of anyone's health or eye care. Their opticians are terrible, won't find the proper codes to get the right prescriptions. I was called in to come pick up my daughter's glasses only to have to hand them back to the optician. We had to wait an extra two weeks for my daughter's new glasses because they didn't order the proper protective lenses. Now, I've requested my daughter's medical records and I had to call them back to see why no one had contacted me to tell me when they were ready. I was left on hold for 10 minutes only to have someone finally pick up the line, put me on hold again and say the woman in charge of getting my daughter's records was out of the office for the day. They said they'd call me back the next day with an update. I waited all day the next day. When I finally gave up and put my phone elsewhere, then they called and left me a voicemail that the supervisor is reviewing my daughter's records and that's why I haven't gotten them yet. You know there's something fishy going on there. As of tomorrow, if they don't hand the records over, they will be in violation of state law. This is a terrible practice. Probably the worst in the area. Run far, far away.<//review><time>1510302584200< /time><Response>{'time': 1516932674916, 'text': 'We learn from everybody and that’s what’s makes us better each and everyday.

Our first experience was pretty rough honestly due to long wait times and rude staff, which did give us negative thoughts towards the staff and facility in general. However a woman from their HR department recently reached out reguarding my bad experience and she was very professional, understanding attentive, and appologetic. She assured me that my complaint was herd and handled and after speaking with her, and reflecting on how amazing the doctors truely were with my 3 year old (and she  is a handfull 😉) my outlook of the practice has changed 100 fold.</text>

Masks during Covid were not mandated. If you have a vet and staff who ignore science for human health, do they ignore science for pet health too? Furthermore, the vet was way too eager to end the appointment and not interested in answering any of my pet care questions. Not impressed.<//Review>

Great experience. 👍Staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable. The Veterinarian was so kind and gentle AND thorough.  Thankfully our puppies check was and health was great, but from the detailed nature of the exam,  it was clear that if anything was wrong he would have caught it.  I love my fur babies and I am confident I have found a great Veterinarian to care for them and help me keep them healthy and happy. I highly recommend San Joaquin Veterinarian.<//text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Time>1622537918879<//Time><resp>None<//resp><review>We recently brought our dog in for a dental cleaning and mouth problem  because it seemed like she had a tooth issue and it maybe needed a removal judging by her behavior. We aren't foreign to this due to the fact that she has had several teeth pulled in the past (she just has bad teeth, we've tried everything to combat the issue) and we are very familiar with the signs. However, the vet seemed to think it was an intestinal issue and claimed that he saw nothing wrong, he barely examinedher mouth in front of us, he was so sure of himself that he didn't listen to us, the owners. So we were skeptical when we left, and had near insisted that it was her teeth and we felt they should have xrayed her mouth but they did not. After a week of antibiotics, nothing changed so we called and complained and they "squeezed us in" an additional week later, it should have been sooner and they should have made more of an effort to do so when I complained that the vet had overlooked the issue. When we brought her back they realize the  issue and at that point it had advanced horribly. There is no way that in one week her tooth and the gums around it would become so bad (they called it necrotic.) They had failed to listen to us when we insisted that it was a tooth problem (seeing as we had past experiences with the issue.)
Our poor dog had to suffer an extra two weeks due to them! She was REALLY bad and we couldn't afford to take her to the E.R. having just paid for her previous appointment and the body (excluding the head) xrays and medication they gave her. They put us in a terrible position as dog owners, it was gut wrenching and it could have been avoided had they done their job correctly. When we brought her back and had the tooth extracted they charged us as if nothing had happened, I was assuming that they would reduce the cost or even ACKNOWLEDGE that they had done wrong. Instead, when I picked her up that day, the tech had the nerve to point out how bad it was in front of a full lobby of people as if WE had done wrong. I did not berate her in front of the other customers, though I absolutely had the right to complain.
We are long time customers, but we are disgusted and dismayed by our experience and their lack of professionalism.
We are now shopping for a new vet.
We shall not be returning.</review><rating>1<//rating>< gmap_id>

They were highly considerate and very sweet to us the entire time we were with them, we had to put our last pup down about a week ago and they were very gentle with her and us, they are so friendly. They even went out of their way to send us a card in the mail, which lifted our spirits and honestly made us all very happy to know that someone else cared. This will always be one of my top recommended vets as they are truthful and want what's best for you and your pet.<//Review>

<text>My cousin took her dog there at the time she was asked and I called back at 2pm... she hadn’t been touched. They then said she was aggressive... she was afraid I’m sure, but she is an 8lb puppy... they were trying to defend themselves by saying “she was mean” ... my cousin has always loved them... we speak every day. I’m close with this pup... and she doesn’t like anyone at first. It takes about five seconds of effort with her to let her feel comfortable...  when we stopped at a dog park, she went potty for-EVER!!! PLEASE USE ANOTHER VET... After reading reviews... it seems like they aren’t double checking regular activities and WOW they overcharged my cousin...<//text>< userid>

I will not be returning to this vet.  My dog had dental cleaning and removal of several teeth.  There is a sign on the door that masks are voluntary and only one employee was wearing a mask.  There were no social distancing procedures and customers (few wearing masks) crowded into the entrance when I was dropping my dog off in the morning.  Here's my problem with this.  If they ignore safety precautions based on science for human customers, do they ignore safety precautions such as sterilizing equipment and tools used on my pet?  Maybe my baby was contained in a bacteria ridden kennel after surgical removal of teeth?  Maybe she was not given an antibiotic (which I paid for)?  Maybe whoever removed her teeth did not wash their hands after handling another pet who had a more serious condition such as an infection?  Actions speak louder than words and I have no faith or trust that this vet would provide a clean, disease free environment for my pet because they are not willing to provide that environment for their customers.<//Text>

I took her in for n issue and looking for guidance, wanting to make sure she wasn't in any pain. The vet could not have been more compassionate. He's a keeper! It's refreshing to see someone in 2020 with his attitude and spirit. Would highly recommend this practice.< /text>< Pics>

Staff was very caring and professional. They let us come in within an hour to treat our injured Rottweiler. Treatment was not expensive considering my dog stayed overnight, other Veterenary places charge a leg and arm or they won’t even give you an appointment</review>

<rate>2< /rate><text>First visit and not exactly impressed. Not mandating masks which irritated me. Do they realize coronavirus is asymptomatic? It's not about choice but consideration for others. I waited 45 mins for a 10 min. appt where the doctor was eager to pass me off to the helper. Which was actually fine since his hesitation and vagueness in answering questions made made me wonder.  I could sense a lack of sincerity from office staff up front while listening to conversations with other customers. I need to find a place where vets treat animals the way their owners do.< /text>< pics>

<Text>Took my dog in for severe issues. These people are used to treating farm animals and are too swamped because supposedly, when my dog was diagnosed with lymphoma, not only did the doctor tell us to cut our losses, but they didn't even give him a needle aspiration to formally diagnose him. As a consequence we have been trying to get him treatment but he can't without being officially diagnosed. I have successfully lost two weeks of a chance to help my pet because this doctors office was exceedingly irresponsible. If your pet is family, dont bring them here.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Review>I love this place and Dr. Willis. It is very difficult to find a competent vet for pot belly pigs but Dr. Willis and his staff have proven to be knowledgable and skilled in the care of my pig children. I have had  absolutely horrific experiences with vets who claimed to be expert in mini pig medical procedures who in reality were anything but that. I will never 100% recover from the horror of seeing the suffering endured by someone i loved so much all caused by ignorant self- absorbed  veterinarians who lied about their abilities and experience in treating pet pigs, who are vastly different from other domestic animals. I have full confidence in Dr. Willis to take care of my pigs medical needs and that does not come easily for me. Not at all. But I cannot recomend him enough if you have a beloved  pig in your life.  Moving recently to a new area and having to find a new vet was a very scary prospect for me and i am so grateful to have found this clinic. The entire staff i have dealt with have been wonderful and exceedingly helpful. This place is just great!</Review>< Pictures>

Just a heads up not a single employee wears a mask here. I didn’t want to really give a bad review so I settled on 3 stars because the service itself was fine. It was disheartening to see that every single customer was wearing a mask and doing their diligence to protect the staff while the staff was not returning the favor. I find it selfish and disrespectful that they don’t wear masks especially now that it’s spiking In our area again. I was just surprised that no masked were worn, even when you’re crammed in the exam room and can’t keep your distance, so I wanted to warn anyone that might not know. I feel like they should tell people when they call to schedule their appointments.<//text>

<user_name>Michele Hollis</user_name><pics>None<//pics><review>4-stars! SJV has a guy, in the back, whom we've never met, who saved our pet. Classified as "exotic," we paid all (costly) labs to find out what ailed our baby. An underlying, seemingly systemic, infection was the culprit. Surgery wasn't possible again. Antibiotics were helping but the problem persisted. The Guy suggested a "last ditch" option requirimg diligence and courage on our part. The regimen took about 1 week, steady application, and worked! Our baby is healthy, happy and free of ailment. Remission may not last due to uncontrolled variables like age. But it's been 3-months and no episodes! We're happy! SJV may not have all the answers for your pet, but did continue to help when our baby's health diminished. Recommend SJV when considering above-average care for your pets.<//review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I took my chihuahua here(she’s now passed) to get her spayed and have her nails clipped. They cut the entire nail off, quick and all, on two of her nails. Clearly didn’t preform the surgery right because her health started declining severely after we took her there. After it “healed,” she developed raw skin all around the area, developed large bumps on her stomach, lost hair, and lost all of her weight before she passed away. They also wrapped her up in bandages that were stuck to her fur on both her back & stomach that we couldn’t touch without her yelping. I took a dog in recently for shots and no one was wearing masks. I think it’s best to not take the risk and go somewhere else.</Text>< pics>

<name>Mike Blyth</name><gmapID>0x80ea449b9e50d571:0x4d5edbb45ba21079</gmapID><text>I was  feeling very uncomfortable sitting in the waiting and exam rooms at San Joaquin Vet Hospital for the first time--no one was wearing a mask! Even the tech coming into the small room to talk to me about my dog did not have one.

It got worse. Even the *vet* himself didn't wear a mask. When I asked him why the staff weren't wearing them, he said "Because we're American citizens and it's our right to choose. You can do what you want."

I said that I felt disrespected (i.e. because of the absence of masks, not his comment) and he blew up -- this is the vet, a professional -- and said that the answer to that was I could go somewhere else. I would never go back there. I would have disagreed but understood if he had tried to handle my complaint in a professional way, but this was way out of line.<//text><time>1598028003062<//time><response>None</response>< UserId.>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Wonderful staff, they were so thoughtful and helpful. I had to take my dog to that awful emergency vet because of an injury and they refused to give him anything for pain without a $60 blood panel. So I went to San Joaquin the next morning and explained it all to the doctor and he gave me the pain meds (it was just an anti inflammatory) with no hassle and no $60 blood panel was needed. I will never take my fur babies anywhere else!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80ea449b9e50d571:0x4d5edbb45ba21079< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The staffs were helpful. The vet is very caring, honest and love animals. He was very sympathetic he was emotional when there is not much he can do with our 5 weeks old puppy, when he said internal problem and that the puppy only has few hrs to live. True the puppy went to sleep forever 5hrs after that.< /Review>< Name>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I can't speak highly enough of San Joaquin Vet Hospital. I wish I would have known about this place sooner! I had been taking my pug to Thurman Veterinary Center but they were unable to get my black lab in until the end of the month. While Thurman was very courteous and professional, I was blown away by the hospitality, warmth and overall friendliness of the staff at San Joaquin. They had a spacious front lobby, including a kids corner, and I think we met half the staff because everyone came out to say hi to our lab :) I'm actually looking forward to our next visit in 3 weeks and I'll definitely be taking my pug there from now on as well.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80ea449b9e50d571:0x4d5edbb45ba21079< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

They even kept her overnight as the weather was bad & didn't want us to drive in the weather!!! To top that off they didn't charge us for her stay! THANKS AGAIN for taking care of our Momma girl & keep up the Amazing work!!! Robert & Lori Rose</review>< date>

I absolutely loved this veterinarian in the beginning. After they pushed me into having my dog neutered while he was in for another surgery I had second thoughts. When I picked him up he was covered in vomit, urine and feces. As well as a hudge mark on his nose. I would recommend this place as they are friendly and prices are fair. I am just disappointed in how my dog was returned to me<//Text>

<Review>My family and I were going out of town for a trip and we needed to board our 2 year old lab. I've boarded her there before and had no problems, so we decided to book again. While on vacation, I received a call (not from San Joaquin) that my dog was running down Allen with no collar on (San Joaquin removes collars when boarding) and that the caller has my dog. Now, I didn't have service at the time of the call so I didn't know about this until a few hours later when I regained cell service. When I did regain cell service I found out the real series of events that took place. An employee at San Joaquin took my dog to the play area, while in the play area my dog somehow got out and instead of the employee going in to get help to get my dog back, they didn't mention anything. So no one, besides the employee responsible for my dog, knew she was missing. When the caller found my dog, she immediately took her to San Joaquin to see if she was chipped (because she had no collar on), which is how she got my information, the caller then took my dog back to her place of work (down the street from San Joaquin) for over 2 hours! Before someone from San Joaquin called her saying "ummm, I think the dog you have is supposed to be here with us". Now, I understand people make mistakes but what is the most frustrating from the whole situation is I NEVER received a call from San Joaquin, in fact, if the caller would not have told me what happened, I would have never known! They would have not told me and pretended as if it never happened. The manager did inform me the employee was fired (not my intention) and didn't charge me for my dog's stay (not my intention either). I'm a pretty understanding person but to not even get a courtesy call after losing my dog for over 2 hours after she was running down Allen with no collar was just unacceptable to me. Needless to say, I won't be boarding my animals there any time soon!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< UserId.>

Amazing place to bring your animals! I brought my kitty Gillagan on Monday morning because he had a urinary blockage and looked so sick and in pain. Dr. Willis and his stuff are wonderful people and literally saved my kitty's life! He's back to acting like his old playful self. I recommend anyone to come here for their veterinary needs.</review>

Made me wait 45 minutes with no explanation and told me waiting wouldn't kill me. Then said I spit at them and cussed them out when nothing like that happened. They lied to save their hides and make it look like I was In the wrong. I will be seeking a defamation case due to this.<//review>

I brought my 10 year old shi-Tzu here on her death bed after valley oaks vet hospital couldn't figure out what was wrong with her and almost killed her and the doctor here admitted my dog got her rehydrated put her on the right kind of medicine and the next day she was able to come home with me! She has been going strong for over a year! I refuse to see any one else for any of my fur babies!  They are the best! Staff are super friendly, they care, and will do anything to save your babies! If I could give more then 5 stars I would! And they are very affordable!< /Text>

Ive know Dr. Willis since this place first opened, I have had nothing but the best experience each and every time. They truly care about your pets here and form bonds with them like they would their own.< /text>

<review>I never wanted to leave this review...but after seeing another review that is exactly the same...I need to share. Early last year, we took our healthy, vibrant, incredible dog to get neutered. He was barely 6 years old and full of life. They stated that the surgery went well, and he was bleeding a little more than usual so recommended he stay there. I also woke up to the worst call of my life stating he died some time in the night and they believed his stomach flipped. They offered to cremate him which was kind, and sent flowers...however, I started receiving calls soon after hounding me for payment. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? After calling and crying on the phone-only then-did they remove the balance. Not having an overnight staff and demanding the dog's stay after surgery is NOT OKAY. This was the worst experience of my life, truly.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80ea449b9e50d571:0x4d5edbb45ba21079< /GmapID></record>

The only place I trust with my furkids. I love that I can get in immediately if needed. They care for my Shih Tzu's like they are part of their own extended family.
Reasonable prices & I always know exactly what I paid for before leaving.</review>

<date>1397934355155< /date><Rate>1</Rate><review>I brought my dog here to get spayed. She was young at 3 years old, very lively and very healthy. I had never had a dog spayed or neutered before, so this was my first experience with it.  I dropped her off in the morning as instructed. She was as lively and happy as ever. I called later that afternoon after her surgery to check on her and they told me over the phone that she was doing fine and they fed her a little bit and they walked her around a little bit. I went to bed early, eager to go pick her up in the morning. Instead I woke up tot he worst phone call of my life so far. An employee telling me they found her dead. Apparently they don't have overnight staff, which they never informed me of on paper or verbally, and she died some time in the very early morning hours. I immediately went down to go see her for myself and say goodbye. The doctor had nothing to offer but apologies and and guesses. Guesses because they weren't there. She probably could have been saved if someone was there to help her. I've never gone back there and never will. If your dog ever requires surgery, don't take it there or your dog might die of neglect too. The people there were friendly, but friendly does not excuse such extreme incompetence. I took home a box of ashes instead of the healthy, happy, playful family member that I trusted them to care for.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>I could not be more impressed with my experience with happy jewelers. My fiancé & I will be forever customers! Josh absolutely killed it with my wedding band & was a pleasure to work with. There was a minor concern with my engagement ring & the customer service we received was above & beyond. Gabe & josh made sure everything was perfect. Thank you guys so much for making this experience so fun ! Can’t wait to build our jewelry  collection with more of their amazing pieces!< /text>< Name>

< Review>
Happy Jewelers is THE BEST place for jewelry shopping. My husband purchased my engagement ring from them and has since bought two wedding bands as well. The service is impeccable and they are truly on top of every detail when working with their customers. We were in a tight situation and needed our order in a short amount of time and Pete did so well to ensure our ring was made and ready in less than 3 weeks. Cannot recommend this store or give them a better review. Don't go anywhere else!< /Review>

We had the best experience with Josh replacing the center stone of my engagement ring that was lost. The whole process was very straight forward. He was excellent at explaining the stone quality and helping us figure out exactly what we wanted. Thank you. We will definitely come back.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>3 words: Best. In. Class. Listen to the reviews and RUN (don’t walk) to this store! They’re at the top of every list for a reason! Pete provided hands down THE BEST customer service we’ve ever received. We were new engagement ring shoppers and were pretty overwhelmed when we first stepped into Happy... until we found Pete. Pete gave us endless diamond knowledge, honest and sincere feedback, and a comfortable environment to compare every option. We went back and forth for hours across two separate visits. Pete and the entire team at Happy made us feel like family every minute that we were there. If the service alone isn’t enough for you, the selection and pricing is also unmatched - we shopped around quite a bit and no one could touch the quality or the pricing at Happy. We made our final purchase at Happy and we’ve never been so sure of such a large decision. We can’t wait to come back for years to come! We will be telling anyone and everyone who will listen to come to Happy. Thank you to Pete and the whole Happy Jewelers team from the bottom of our hearts. We will cherish and remember our experience forever!< /Review>< Pictures>

If you have a vision, Happy Jewelers makes it a reality! Danny and his team of designers reset my halo engagement ring and matching band into this STUNNING knife edge design. The workmanship is beyond superb! Danny took a personal and vested interest in what I wanted, created a mold, and ultimately casted my vision into reality. I can't keep my eyes off of my amazing "new" beautiful ring - I absolutely love it! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!<//text>

I am absolutely in love with my ring. This is exactly the ring I described to my fiancé (engagement photos attached). Happy Jewelers made my dream ring. Everywhere I go, I get so many compliments on this ring. It really brings the "wow" factor and people literally say "wow" on a regular basis. On top of that, their service is amazing and everyone is so kind and inviting whenever we go in there. Happy Jewelers, you have a customer for life!< /Text>

I cannot say enough great things about Happy Jewelers. My latest purchase with them was an anniversary gift for my boyfriend. I asked them to recreate his passed father’s necklace and they recreated it perfectly!! The necklace was very specific so I sent them pictures and they were amazing to communicate with. They understood how important this was to me to get this necklace right, and it turned out amazing. He loves it and it will always remind him of his father! He also bought my anniversary gift at Happy Jewelers and I love it! Its a gold heart locket necklace with a K engraved on the front. It is so special to me. I will definitely keep purchasing from Happy Jewelers!</Text>

<Review>I have worked with Gabe and his staff at Happy Jewelers for 20 years now.  Their work is impeccable. Gabe knows i am very fussy about my jewelry and he always manages to make me happy. Excellent quality. Excellent prices.  One of my favorite pieces was a 4 ct orange sapphire that Gabe designed a vintage setting because he knew how much I loved that. He worked with my husband and they surprised me.  Another beautiful gift was a necklace that matched a ring I have. I opened it on Christmas and immediately said it matches my ring!  Gabe had done that not my husband.  With all of his clients he actually remembered my jewelry and suggested the gift to my client.  They stand behind their work and they stand behind their products.  I highly, highly recommend Happy Jewelers!  You will never be disappointed!< /Review>< time>

The quality and service is always exceptional, I bought my wife’s wedding band here when it was Newport Jewelers some 7 years ago, Gabe and his bro have always taken care of me, they can do some amazing custom work and the quality is above the rest. I highly recommended checking out Happy Jeweler especially if you have a design in mind they can help to bring it to life through many years of experience and being well know on the jewelry industry.<//Review>

Honestly, Happy Jewelers is so solid! I had been to a handful of other places both big and small stores. The sales people at HJ are super helpful, non pressuring and honest. Elaine was awesome! Easy to work with. Hayley and Lupita came over to help give their opinions, which were super helpful. I’ve referred my friends and family to Happy Jewelers because they’re the best! The ring I got for my fiancé was perfect! It was the cleanest and best Diamond I found out there. The pricing was comparable to other places but the stones are all real. Don’t go cheap and buy a lab created, get some value in a real diamond. If you’re cool and honest they will usually do their best in working with your price range. Go there and make your significant other happy!!</text>

I worked with Pete to help me find an engagement ring for my soon to be fiancé.  It was a very good experience.  Happy Jewelers has a wide range of options and their staff is amazing.  I have been to many jewelers stores in the past and you usually have a pretty stuff staff....not a happy jewelers.  Everyone working there is friendly and helpful.   Great experience, great options and  pricing is hands down the best.  Will go there for any other jewelry needs.</Review>

I appreciate Happy Jewlers staff for their personalized approach and exceptional price for reattaching my wedding ring diamond within hours. They also cleaned my other jewelry while my ring was being repaired.  I even left with a bag of goodies so that I can continue to keep my jewelry clean and sparkling at no additional cost. A great experience, trustworthy .. a busy place with enough staff to care for all the customers and why I will return and have recommended them to my family and friends.  Thanks again 🥰< /Review>

I bought a 14k gold chain at what I later found out to be was a 40% mark up of what the actual gold is worth. In the end that's my luck for not doing more research on the value of gold, but I had no idea I'd need to be educated in jewelry shopping to not be ripped off here. Chains nice though so there's that, but odds are if you're new to doing jewelry shopping you may get overcharged.< /Text>< Resp>

I have been following Happy Jewelers on Instagram for a very long time! Every piece of jewelry is absolutely stunning and I would always show my husband all of the beautiful pieces. Back in September, he bought me my first custom name necklace from Happy Jewelers! It was so stunning and unique❤️ I couldn’t wait for his birthday because I knew I would be looking purchasing a chain through Happy Jewelers! Being that I’m out of state, I was nervous as I wouldn’t be able to touch/see the chains in person but thankfully I worked with Hayley who was extremely helpful. I explained what I was looking for and she immediately found the best option. When I received the chain, it exceeded my expectations and it was absolutely perfect. The whole interaction was seamless and I cannot wait to purchase more through them!</review>

Absolutely LOVE the attention to detail from Happy Jewelers. Gabe and his team really know how to take care of all customers. No matter how large or small your purchase is they will always treat you as if your the only one at the store. My husband and I have been going to them for over 10 years now and we don’t plan on going anywhere else for our jewelry needs. Congratulations on the new location it looks amazing and you deserve it Happy Jewelers! Thank you for the great prices and wonderful quality pieces you provide us customers.</Text>

Happy Jewelers has officially won me over as a lifetime customer. Their customer service truly sets them apart from others. We came in without a specific design in mind and even though they were packed with customers, Hayley dedicated her time and attention to making sure we got exactly what we wanted. They were accurate to their quoted manufacturing time and their pricing is phenomenal given the high quality and craftsmanship. We’ve gone back a couple times since and every time we are treated with consistently outstanding service. Danny also deserves a special shoutout for his attention and help in guiding us through the process. Don’t be overwhelmed by the crowds, they are in the process of getting their own store nearby and truly, they are worth the wait (I’ve been there when I haven’t had to wait at all- depends on their high traffic times).< /Review>

I've been going to Happy Jewelers for just over a decade now. I was initially introduced to them by my uncle when I was looking for a watch. I had a great experience, the people were super helpful and did not pressure me at all. Years later, I went back for my engagement ring. Again, had an excellent experience. My now wife had some ring questions, she visited them, and came home delighted with her experience. She echoed their helpfulness in answering her questions, and never pushed her just to make a sale or towards a more expensive item. I go back from time to time for smaller gifts and whenever I'm asked for jeweler recommendations, I send them to Happy Jewelers.< /review>

My husband Ryan purchased my engagement ring, wedding band, and Rolex watch here. He even got a custom wedding band with diamonds all around that is super unique. I LOVE all the jewelry I have from these guys. Amazing quality and reasonable price. Highly recommend!!! Will never go anywhere else!< /Review>

I worked with Armida to create a beautiful custom engagement ring.  She took my ideas, added her suggestions, and really brought my idea to life.  My fiance is thrilled with this piece, and I know she cherishes the quality of her ring.  We are currently working with her on the wedding bands, and the process is really fun.  I am a happy jeweler customer for life.< /text>

I dealt remotely with Lovella who helped me create my dream wedding band. She was so lovely to work with and was quick to respond, sent me pictures and videos, answered all my questions and was very professional. I would absolutely recommend happy jewelers to anyone in the market for jewelry!<//Review>

I have been following Happy Jewelers on Instagram for a while now and fell in love with their rings, necklaces, and so much more. I contacted them through their website a month ago and Brianna contacted me through text the following day. She was very helpful in answering my questions and responding in a timely manner. She also helped me find the perfect diamond in my budget. My ring had to be custom made and was told it would take 4-6 weeks. Today marks the 4th week and the ring was ready to be picked up. I am so incredibly happy! The ring came out perfectly and I am 110% satisfied. I can’t stop staring at my ring 😍 thank you so much for the amazing service and ring of my dreams. I will be back!<//Text>

Their customer service is second to none. Everyone was very attentive and knowledgeable of the products they sell.

The best place in Southern California for all of your Jewelry needs. Great selection and great customer service. Attention to detail is clearly prioritized. Pricing is more than reasonable and better than any big box store. When you visit this location you will see why their counter is exceptionally busy compared to the surrounding counters.< /Text>

Happy Jewelers is my jeweler for life! Danny and Gabe as well as the whole crew Pete, Molly etc. are amazing!  It is rare to get this level of customer service anywhere let alone at a jeweler.  Danny and Gabe can literally find you anything. I kid you not, they found me an old school 24k gold & black Breitling Bentley with the gator strap. This was the exact watch I had my eye on for years, but I couldn't find it from a reliable source just shady folks on the internet. These guys went ABOVE and BEYOND to get the perfect watch and then followed it up with a custom Cuban/earrings/pendant for me and my wife. My loyalty has to be earned, and I wouldn't go anywhere else but Happy Jewelers.</review>

The hype is real. After looking at what seemed hundreds of different engagement rings and jewelers, I decided to work with Happy Jewelers. I worked with Molly, who took the time to answer many questions lol After looking at rings on a Saturday, I made the purchase that following Monday. The ring arrived before I was going to propose to my now fiancé and wow, I couldn't have been happier with the overall experience. My fiancé LOVES the ring, and so do her friends and family. We will for sure be repeat customers at Happy Jewelers in the future. Molly is so great to work with and would highly recommend working with her!</text>

I've know Gabe and Daniel for years. When the time came for me to purchase an emgagement ring they were the first people I called. While I was there they showed me many options and answered any questions I had. Very knowledgeable. It was a great experience.

Took my finance there when it was time to purchase our wedding rings and that was awesome as well.< /Review>

I love this place. When we first got engaged this is where we got the engagement ring and wedding band for my now wife. We keep coming back for best prices and service. The brothers who own this place are super knowledgeable and patient. We bought a number of items here and simply couldn’t be happier. Every time we go they also offer to clean my wife’s wedding band at no charge. They really take care of their customers.</review>

Every purchase has been a Wonderful experience. I contact Lupe at Happy Jewelers whenever I am looking for a gift for family, friends or just for me. Lupe help me with a custom designed engagement ring. She has always been concerned about my satisfaction rather than making a sale and how much I am willing to spend. That seems to be the culture found at Happy Jewelers and, in my humble opinion, the reason that most of their sales comes from returning customers. They look to satisfy a customer and get them exactly what they are looking for while staying within your budget Level. No pressure or hard sales tactics, just good business and standing behind there product. Thank you Lupe and all the folks at Happy Jewelers.<//Text>

<review>We’ve been going to Happy Jewelers for over 10 years and Gabe and his folks have been helping us with amazing jewelry and personal care the whole time. Any time we come in they recognize us, clean and repair items for free and make custom items. If you truly want to have your own personal jeweler I would highly recommend this family business. I sent everyone I know to them because they treat me like family and love what they do.  They never try and oversell you and the other customers I’ve met there are all long time customers, because they take care of their guests.< /review><UserId.>100192654091981077038<//UserId.>< username>

Went in & purchased a second dainty diamond ring, used a Yelp voucher this time. Everyone was friendly & during this covid time, everyone was wearing masks. My ring had to be custom made so I received it about 6 weeks after I placed the order. Definitely the place I’ll continue to go for jewelry!< /review>

<Text>I have bought several pieces of jewelry from Happy Jewelers.  Jewelry ranging from small initial rings to wedding bands and Rolex watches.   I absolutely love the new stuff that I bought from them and also things that they have upgraded for me and turned out to be so beautiful and exactly what I’ve asked for. The prices are unbeatable and the customer service is the best I’ve had buying all my jewelry. I cannot wait to go back and look at a rose gold Rolex. That is the next piece that I am going to purchase from only Happy Jewelers.
Thank you so much Gabe, you’ve done a great job building this business and top of the line customer service. I can’t wait to see all of you again.

<time>1599106896731</time><Text>Happy Jewelers is by far the best jeweler in all of Southern California. It’s a great family run business. Gabe, Danny and staff are honest, friendly, knowledgeable, and make you feel like family as well. They can accommodate any price range from big to small. They really take their time working with you to make sure you find exactly what you are looking for. You won’t ever leave there questioning your purchase or wondering if you made the right decision or not. I was the type to always get a few quotes on everything I buy, especially jewelry. Happy Jewelers has always beaten the price from other jewelry companies and it’s not even close. I have been coming to them for years now. Believe me,  once you go in there and find out for yourselves, you won’t ever have to worry about finding a jeweler ever again. I know I have mine for life and it’s Happy Jewelers!!!</Text>< Rate>

Happy Jewelers was recommended to me by a friend for creating a custom engagement ring. I had one stone I wanted to use in addition to 2 new stones. They were very welcoming and helped solidify details. Their pricing is very reasonable and the time to receive my ring was reasonable. They did an impeccable job and made my vision come to life. Will definitely be back in the future for additional jewelry purchases.</Text>

I found them through Instagram and I had to go see them. I went with my husband and we picked out my new rings Because sadly I lost my other rings on a Hawai’i trip. They were so sweet and kind very attentive and were listening to everything you had to say, ever since I buy all my jewelry with them it’s addicting buying from them they have the cutest things and very affordable prices. They have the best customer service hands down please dont ever change that ❤️<//Text>

<text>Danny from Happy Jewelers was amazing to us the whole process. He was patient, answered all of our questions, and let us steer the process as much as we wanted while also giving valuable direction. When the time of the engagement came, and Danny saw that the ring was not going to be delivered to the store in time for me to pick up as originally planned, he took it upon himself to drive to downtown LA, pick up the ring, and hand deliver it to my apartment in South LA. I was floored at the level of customer service. They also continued to follow up with me after the purchase was made, and they even clean the rings (of my wife's and mine) for free when we drop by. Would ABSOLUTELY choose them as my Jeweler for life.</text><time>1598917064829< /time>< gmapID>

You can imagine, buying an engagement ring and wedding bands is a pretty scrutinizing process. This team was there to helpfully work with me, happily make adjustments, hear my concerns and seek to give me a product that I loved. The rings look great! But the service I received felt like family.<//text>

<Review>I was referred by my hairdresser who has gorgeous jewelry & after walking in to the jewelry mart & seeing their site packed with people when the other sites were empty, I had hight hopes. A pair of diamond earrings later, I referred them to 2 friends, who also bought jewelry! I haven’t been for awhile, but, I’m getting in the mood! Can’t wait to see their new store!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Happy Jewelers is hands down the best place for quality jewelry and fine watches. As long as they’re in business I won’t go anywhere else. Their prices are simply hard to believe and their service is amazing. Just stepping foot in the center where they are located is proof. Their counter is always buzzing with crowds while all the other adjacent vendors are sitting there staring at their phones.<//review>

Great service. Works within your budget. No hidden fees or upcharges. Does not pressure sell at all. I have bought multiple items from Happy Jewelers and have been satisfied every time.  We had 1 problem where an opal cracked and half of it was missing and the replaces it with a similar stone no charge. I have not bought jewelry from anyone else in over 15 years.< /text>

Happy Jewelers has the best service we have had at a jewelry store. I’ve bought a beautiful gold chain for my husband, had a treasured pendent reworked, had several rings sized, had the stone in a class ring replaced and sold gold to them for a very fair price. We’ll be back soon!< /review>

Happy Jewelers was the best decision I made when getting my fiancée her perfect ring. They were receptive to your needs, offer great advice, and the price point is super reasonable. I would recommend Happy Jewelers, specifically Hayley for anyone looking to get any piece of jewelry! My fiancée went back to them for my ring and we are in awe with both pieces. Thank you so much to all at Happy Jewelers!< /review>

<Text>Purchased an engagement ring through Gabe Arik, he was unbelievable.  Answered every call, responded by text.  Sent pictures and videos.  We were looking for a specific diamond, he found it and it was more gorgeous then we could imagine.  The ring is so stunning, I have no words.

Happy Jewelry did an amazing job for me and helped me put together an engagement ring that my  fiance loves. I had a trip planned with my girlfriend and dragged my feet to buy the ring. I went to Happy Jewelry with an idea of what my girlfriend would like based on what her best friend told me. They spent time showing me bands and stones until we got close to the combination that I thought my girlfriend would like. While I was still in the shop my girlfriend's best friend sent me photos. After that we got fully dialed in. Happy Jewelry listened to what I wanted and built me ring that matched my vision completely (including an engraving on the band).  Growing up my brother was really close with one of the owners Gabe who has always remained a family friend. When it was time to buy an engagement ring I found a way to get his cell number from my mom's ancient phone book while visiting.  I spoke to friends who had just bought engagement rings and did some online research. However, I wanted a professional that works in that field that I could trust to make sure I got things right. I did not want to become a diamond expert and buy it online. Gabe was that professional and they did a great! My fiance's dad got a hold of me to say congratulations and then made a point of saying how nice the ring looks.<//Review>

I first bought my wife’s engagement ring after she saw her friend’s engagement ring and fell in love with it. I’ve since returned to purchase several other pieces for her. I can’t say enough good things about the personal service I always receive. I have the utmost trust in these guys. They stand by their work and continue to clean / service all pieces I have purchased. This is the only jeweler I would even consider visiting.

<text>If I could rate 6 stars I would because I can’t think Armida and the Happy Jewelers staff enough. My fiancé loves her ring, and there’s not a day strangers don’t compliment it. We will be buying jewelry from this company for many years to come.</text>< Pics>

Couldn't be more satisfied with my decision to purchase 2 timepieces from Happy Jewelers.  I spoke to one of the owners, Danny.  He was very knowledgeable and professional.   Both watches were pre-owned (Tag & Rolex).  Both were priced right and in pristine condition just like the online description...NO SURPRISES!  Shipping was fast even during this pandemic.  Now I understand why Happy Jewelers has so many rave reviews.  They are well deserved.  They exceeded my expectations.</Text>

First of all I would like to say thank you to the entire happy jewelers team!!!! They did an amazing job with my wife’s ring and treated us like family from the second we walked in, they are seriously all amazing and all have a special talent when it comes to jewelry and people skills in general! If you’re not buying at happy jewelry you are seriously messing up! Great prices and top notch quality! Thank you again to the entire team!<//Review>

My wife's rings are gorgeous and we are both so happy with them. Happy Jewelers custom made both the engagement ring and the wedding band and they look so beautiful. The staff is always extremely helpful and friendly; I cannot recommend them enough. They even helped me fix my grandfathers tie pin! Thank you so much for your great service and beautiful jewelry.< /Text>

I have been a satisfied and grateful customer of Happy Jewelers for more than 20 years! Gabe and the "Happy Jewelers Family" has always provided me with concierge services and regarded me with kindness.

Happy Jewelers has consistently demonstrated appreciation for my loyalty by assisting me with all of my jewelry services, extending great prices and greeting me with a smile. If you want quality jewelry and quality service make Happy Jewelers your personal place to shop!< /review>

I’ve been buying jewelry from Danny and Gabe for many years now - always referring friends and family with confidence. I’ve dealt with many many different jewelers in the past, but no one comes close to these guys when it comes to quality, service, price, and attention to detail. The business successfully thrives off referrals - definitely check them out.</review>

<Review>These guys are great! I am sadly not loyal to salespeople and I am one. I have been helped by 3 different people here and each one has taken great care. I went in and had a thought in my head of what I wanted for an engagement ring and they made it happen, custom and flawless. They are working on a perfect match wedding band. I also went in and found a wedding band for me that same day. Awesome service fair prices and high quality!</Review><user_id>102119185867979349161</user_id>< GmapID>

My husband and I have been going to Happy Jewelers for the past 6 years. Most recently they helped me via text message to purchase a replacement wedding band for my husband that was lost. I live almost 3 hours away and I couldn’t make the drive. I got the same exact band for him and it was shipped directly to my house within 2 days. They are the only jewelers I trust and I can’t recommend them enough.< /text>

I've been working with Gabe and his staff for over 10 years.  From the first time I purchased the engagement ring for my wife, throughout the various times I've updated, my experience has always been positive.  Everyone at Happy Jewelers shows a genuine care and concern for their customers.</Review>

Happy Jewelers was referred to me so I decided to pay them a visit. After meeting Gabe and Danny I knew I made the right choice. This team has to be one of the best when it comes to customer service and honesty. I traded in my 2 Rolex watches and received a great offer on both. Thank you guys for helping me find my new beautiful Rolex Submariner. I will definitely be back when I’m ready to upgrade to my next one.

Thank you both,

If you want it done right and by the best go see Gabe and the Team at Happy Jewelers. Gabe was referred to me and when I met him he was above and beyond helpful in designing an engagement ring. The crazy part, I ended up ordering the ring 8 months later and he knew exactly every detail of what we discussed months ago. With that said, Gabe truly wants you and your special someone to be happy with what you pick and/or what is designed.  5 stars doesn’t do Gabe and Happy Jewelers justice as its 5+ without question. More importantly for me and my fiancée we have a jeweler for life and a great group of people who aren’t just trying to make money. Thank you Gabe and Happy Jewelers!!!!</text>

We had our ring resized at Happy Jewelers today. They resized our ring in less than two hours. The price was much cheaper than any jewelers around! A guy who helped us was Alex I think. He was very helpful and friendly. I strongly recommand coming here to get jewelries or get jewelries fixed. Thank you Alex and Happy Jewelers! You made our day😁<//text>

Happy jewelers is seriously the best! Gabe and his staff were super friendly and accommodating. They even delivered the ring to my office with no extra fee! My fiancé is in love with her engagement ring and I can’t thank them enough. Pricing was more than fair and their quality of service was top notch. Highly recommended 👍< /Review>

I live in CT, literally the opposite side of the country. But Happy Jewelers was better over the phone than many jewelers were that I went to in person here. I was helped by an amazing associate named Elaine. She worked with me through the whole process, found me the perfect stone and made the setting of my girl’s dreams. Everything was done quick and on time and they even helped me with financing even though usually they do not do financing for out of state customers. I will DEF be going back for my Fiance’s Wedding band too. Thanks so much you guys and especially you Elaine!< /Text>

<text>I went in to look for a wedding band for my fiance and the staff was very attentive and nice. After that I asked to see some bracelets for a birthday present from me to me and they were very patient, showed me so many things and I ended up walking out with more than a band. The customer service was great AAAANNNDDDD...so were the prices!!! Highly recommend this place and I'm sure I will be back for more pieces.<//text>< Pictures>

They take care of every person that comes to their shop and truly focus on the needs of the customer. They are MILITARY FRIENDLY! My husband and I are both active and I almost fell over when Gabe told me what discount he was giving us. We are SO grateful and I stare at my rings everyday - sometimes in disbelief that I own such beautiful pieces. I wish I could stay in California for Happy Jewelers alone! I’ve already shared my story with so many friends. They will always WOW you!!< /Text>< pictures>

Everyone that helped me was so helpful, especially Hayley, she was great at communicating with quick responses about any questions. 10/10 recommend to a friend, no lie this was the first place I went to find a ring and I wouldn't have had to go anywhere else.

I have grown to know Gabe and Danny over the years and consider them family.  I have recommended countless of people to them because you know that they love what they do, they are also very talented when it comes to custom pieces of jewelry.

I would never go anywhere else to purchase anything for myself or my wife, you walk away feeling very satisfied and cared for.

Love these guys!!!!</text>

The people here are very nice and attentive. You show Gabe a picture of anything, he can make it!   I have recommended to many people. Shop around, get prices then go to Happy Jewelers, he will match or beat that price. You will NOT be disappointed!  Always my first choice. Thanks Gabe-< /Review>

I wanted to get my wife a new ring for our 10 year anniversary.  I shopped around and compared diamond prices and quality and also the trustworthiness of the vendors as I have been taken advantage of before.  I found Happy Jewelers and couldn’t have been happier.  Korrin met with me multiple times to ensure I found the right ring and her service and the service of the entire staff was top notch!  I have already sent a friend and a family member there for their diamond needs and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a great deal and an honest dealer.< /text>

Happy Jewelers is the best! They helped my (now) husband design the most perfect ring for me!! And even got the size right just from looking at a picture of me!  We have gone in a bunch to pick out wedding bands, earrings, and other jewelry. Gabe, Danny, and the entire staff are always so helpful to us. We have recommended a bunch of friends to Happy Jewelers and will continue to do so :)</text>

Gabe and Danny are knowledgeable, professional, and happy to make a deal.  The whole staff is well equipped to handle any request.  The whole group at Happy really knows the meaning of “customer service.”  You won’t be disappointed making a purchase at Happy Jewelers<//review>

Always feel at home when I walk into Happy Jewelers. Family owned and they welcome you in with open arms. Great people, pricing of course, and selection. They custom make all my jewelry.</Review>

<Text>I was looking for a ring for my daughter for Rosary Day at her school (the girls are presented with their class ring). I was looking at a few local jewelers and was disappointed in the quality given the price. I remembered hearing about Happy Jewelers and decided to go there. My daughter and I were down right giddy at the selection in our price range, so much so, that I was more than happy to spend a little more to get her a ring she can enjoy forever, and not just as a young girl. Thank you Armida at Happy Jewelers.<//Text>< time>

Happy Jewelers is absolutely amazing. Every time I walk in to see them I am treated like the #1 priority no matter how many clients they have to tend to. They made my engagement ring, wedding band, my husbands wedding band, and multiple other gifts for friends and family and each piece has been nothing but perfection. Each & every employee as well the owners are so kind & personal. I would recommend them to anyone & everyone!!!< /Text>

<Review>You absolutely can't find a better place for custom jewelry designs, wedding rings, watches and repairs.  I've been going to Happy Jewelers for the past few years and their prices can't be beat. Gabe and Danny are the best and so great to work with. They treat their customers like gold and they do whatever it takes to make them happy. They are a class act and a company I'm proud to deal with. Thank you for all you do to make our jewelry dreams come to life.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Happy Jewelers produced every detail I expected on the engagement ring I asked for. I could not be happier with what Korrin helped me design and I could not thank Gabe for ensuring I got what I asked for.

I will never go to another jeweler other than Happy Jewelers. There is no other business as professional, empathetic, and compassionate as the jewelers at Happy Jewelers.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!< /Text>< pictures>

They are amazing at what they do, very knowledgeable and extremely friendly. They made the process of designing a ring simple and exciting. I love my family engagement ring so much that I went back for my wedding ending band...and a couple more pieces because why not!

Thanks Happy Jewelers!</Review>

THE ABSOLUTE BEST! Happy Jewelers was recommended to me by a close friend and they were phenomenal. From the first interaction, everyone was extremely friendly. Armida and Gabe assisted me with a ring for my fiance and it came out exactly how I imagined it. I had a bit of tight time table that I needed it for, and they made it happen! I will be going back for our wedding bands and anything else I have a need for. Happy Jewelers is the best, do not waste your time going anywhere else.< /text>

My husband and I are always happy when we leave Happy Jewelwrs (especially me!) We have been shopping with Danny and Gabe for 10 years. Danny helped me design my 10 year upgrade and it couldn’t be more perfect. The quality and sparkle of their diamonds is like no other.</review>

Happy Jewelers is truly top-notch. I've had the pleasure of working with Armida, and she made sure my experience was superb. She didn't stop until she found the perfect replacement diamond and setting for my engagement ring. I also had a lost watch replaced and couldn't be happier. I live nearly 2k miles away, and customer service didn't miss a beat. Armida is a gem! She's always willing to help. No matter what! Even after the sale! Although I don't buy a ton of jewelry, thanks to Armida, all future purchases will come from Happy Jewelers. I love my Cartier timepiece and custom diamond ring.<//review>

<UserId.>112257372369528130392< /UserId.><Review>I discovered Happy Jewelers on Instagram when I felt like I had limited options-- and boy am I happy I found them!!  My husband (then fiance) proposed with a custom engagement ring produced in NY, we live in LA, so I preferred to work with a local jeweler.  We searched high and low.  DTLA's jewelry district felt like a rat race and I felt like most of the jewelry was low quality and Harry Winston carried a few styles that were fine but I couldn't justify the hefty price tag for styles I wasn't in love with (HW was my last resort).  Finally, I stumbled across Happy Jewelers with some skepticism-- I've never heard of them and they were located in the Fullerton, away from all the hustle and bustle, would they have a good selection?  We are so happy we visited them!  The craftsmanship, quality materials, customer service and price is unparalleled.  My husband and I have personally interacted with Gabe and Danny and it's always been pleasant.  We've purchased both our wedding bands and a few gifts from their location.  Highly recommend!<//Review><response>None</response><date>1530037344382<//date><gmap_id>0x80dcd601d0029277:0xffb037f7b55943c<//gmap_id><name>Tiffany Chi</name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPF9EgK9riobUq2v2udnEe8JZXrZLgIaxHY5KY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Rate>5</Rate></record>

<Text>First off Lovella is wonderful!!! Please see her for all of your custom jewelry needs! My husband took me as a Christmas gift to have a wedding band custom made to match my custom engagement ring. She made the process smooth and had my ring ready even earlier than expected. She was easy to reach and so patient always answering all of my many questions. The wine bottle is a major plus with every purchase. The experience was so great I ended up ordering a wedding band for my husband and Lovella helped me surprise him the day we picked up my wedding band!! Best experience jewelry shopping. My husband and I will be making them our go to jeweler for all of our future purchases.</Text>< pics>

Happy Jewelers is the best place you can go to find the perfect ring for you significant other. Elaine and Gabe (the owner) will do everything they can to help you choose the perfect ring. There is no pressure to buy anything at this place. I love the ring I got and so does my fiancee. We are definitely coming back for our wedding bands. Highly recommended !!</review>

<Review>I love this little gem nestled in Fullerton. We actually live in Vegas but have made a trip out to So. Cal to purchase a ring and set my diamonds on two different occasions. My husband and I have met the owners, Danny and Gabe. Every one there is super friendly and they have amazing prices for their jewelry. Their pieces have so much brilliance and are well made. They also have the best customer service as a jeweler and are willing to work with you to create your dream piece. Thanks again, Happy Jewelers.</Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
It's always a great time seeing the team at Happy Jewelers. Danny is very helpful and and clearly wants you to be happy with your purchase. I have purchased several items for my wife, kids and myself from HJ. Danny and Gabe want you to become life long customers. There's something for everyone at HJ and you are treated top notch regardless if you are spending $100 dollars or 10's of thousands of dollars.</review>

I was referred by my friend, steve to these guys.  I was looking for Rolex watch that was impossible to get.  Check 4 other places and no one had this but happy jewelers hooked it up.  Loving my new watch, the transaction was on point and very professional.  The price was also on point.  I will be definitely buying more watches from these guys! Highly recommend.</text>

We were referred to Happy Jewelers by some good friends. It was a great experience through the whole process. Awesome customer service and took care of us. Super patient with us. In the end my wife found the anniversary diamond ring she wanted. Loves the quality and awesome price. Will be back for sure.</Text>

Very helpful and friendly staff; always willing to accommodate your needs and your budget.

Danny is such an awesome person to work with! He helped me upgrade my wife’s wedding ring set and gave us a very reasonable price. He was very honest and gave very valuable opinions. We bought another ring from them from one of their Christmas specials and the ring is beautiful. Their staff is very helpful and able to answer any questions you have about jewelry.<//Text>

<user_name>Patrick LeMaster</user_name><Text>I had the best experience buying my engagement ring here.

I talked to a lot of other jewelers prior to coming here. Every person I talked to about rings immediately tried to sell me right away. That didn’t happen with Happy Jewelers. I never once felt like I was being sold. It was more about  wanting to get me something I would be extremely happy with.

I wasn’t sure what direction to go with the ring so I asked them for help. All I did was show them images of rings I was looking for, answered some simple questions, and they made the most amazing piece of jewelry I’ve ever bought.

Highly recommend.<//Text>< pictures>

Korrin at Happy Jewelers is the absolute best! She is incredibly professional & takes excellent care of her clients. Whether I’m looking for a small inexpensive gift or a super high end piece she has it covered. I also appreciate that she ships my pieces out promptly & keeps me updated every step of the way, as I don’t live in California. Korrin is an absolute gem, or better yet a diamond!<//text>

<Review>My experience at Happy Jewelers in Fullerton was amazing. I came in on my lunch to look around for earrings as a gift. Stopped at a few other shops near by before and the customer service was not the best I was shown earrings at the highest price even when I mentioned my budget. When I got to happy jewelers Hayley helped me. She asked for my price range showed me a few earring. She gave me a great price on the ones I was interested in. I mentioned I was on my lunch and that I was just down the street and she offered to put them on hold for me. She told me they will be on hold and it's okay if I decide to not come back today. After work I came back and she didn't have to ask me my name and grabbed them for me and showed me one more pair before I made my decision. The customer service by far was the best I received this Christmas year as in shopping for the perfect gift for my mother. I received extra gifts and they even steamed my own rings for me! Thank you so much Happy Jewelers! I will definitely return in the future and recommend anyone interested in jewelry or gifts.<//Review>< Pics>

We have been customers for many years and will never shop anywhere else. In addition to their vast knowledge, their selection, and the excellent customer service they cannot be outdone.  The time they spend helping you make the perfect selection is amazing. They listen to what you want and will design it for you. I highly recommend you try them ....you will immediately become a lifetime customer.<//text>

Gabe is my “go to” Jeweler!! I always enjoy the visit and come away feeling like I have been treated like family. Recommendations are made but there is no pressure and if I need to return to exchange an item I am welcomed and quickly assisted. I never hesitate to recommend Happy Jewelers because I know my friends and family will be well treated! My wife and I bought our wedding rings there and I have returned to buy gifts for her and I (and she) have never been disappointed!!< /review>

Happy Jewelers was awesome to deal with. Gabe, Danny, Sophia and others were very professional, helpful and had great ideas. They gave excellent advice that was in my interest, not theirs. They helped to design then create several custom peices for my wife and my daughter. I am thoroughly pleased. It is no wonder that on a weekend, their counters are very busy while others nearby are not. For me they are worth the drive, with many other jewelers closer to me. Great job guys! A+

In a city full of high end luxury and standard, Happy Jewlers is the top echelon of quality and customer service. My family has been going to them for over 15 years and the area nothing we’ve bought there that doesn’t catch compliments and attention from everyone who sees their jewlery.</text>

Had a custom engagement ring and matching wedding band made. The process was so easy and their prices are so competitive, I ordered from them without hesitation. Gabe was able to select a diamond for me that fit my cut, and was beautiful even though the certificate graded it lower. The ring took about 4 weeks and came out beautiful. Will definitely buy from them again.<//Text>

Happy jewelers is a true 5 star experience.  I had the pleasure to meet the staff & purchase a beautiful engagement ring for my fiancé.    The experience was first class by all accounts.   This jeweler made the purchase so seamless & enjoyable.   They took the time to understand and find the exact ring I was looking to design & purchase.  I was thoroughly impressed traveling to Los Angeles & going through the process of finding the perfect diamond & design as I walked through their factory & shop.   Moreover, the owner Gabe & the General Manager, Armida, hosted me themselves which was so personal they made you feel like family.  I will honestly say , I have purchased many pieces of jewelry over the years, but now will only purchase from Happy Jewelers.  These guys are the best of the best & Armida is a true professional!</text>

Amazing customer service!  Everyone is friendly and their ability to help guide you through a selection was incredible.  Custom made rings were completed from start to finish in less than 3 weeks and they actually exceeding our expectations.   And if that was not enough, their prices simply can’t be beat.</text>

These guys are incredible. I’ve had nothing but great results from them. They know their business well. They’re able to understand what it is I need and produce high quality work based off of my inarticulate explanations! They have a lot of options to choose from but in my case, it’s always been custom work. They do exceptional custom work, can pretty much produce whatever it is you’re imagining. They’re easy to talk to, and break down the terminology so you can understand. Definitely going to continue to use them for all my jewelry needs. Thanks guys!!!< /Text>

I heard about Happy Jewelers from a coworker that was extremely pleased with his custom order so I decided to give them a visit. I was greeted by Nicole. Nicole was very helpful and excellent. I also had the pleasure of meeting Gabe and Danny. All of the staff at Happy Jewelers are exceptional! The whole process from placing the custom order to pick up was super smooth and easy.  I communicated directly with Nicole every step of the way via phone. She was excellent at responding to all of my questions and concerns. Gabe is also so patient and thorough. I'm so pleased with my purchase and will definitely be returning for more! Thank you Gabe, Nicole and Danny for all of your help! I am so glad that I found an honest jeweler I can trust!< /review>

<Review>Happy Jewelers is truly phenomenal! We visited Happy Jewelers after we received a referral. Nicole was amazing and answered all of my questions. Every ring is a custom piece and I was so thankful to have Nicole provide her input and pull different stones, settings and bands to put together a gorgeous piece! I cannot thank this team enough for the great experience and an absolutely stunning upgrade. Thank you Gabe, Nicole and Danny for the exceptional experience from start to finish. I am so HAPPY with my custom rings!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I was recommended Happy Jewelers by a friend and after looking at a few other jewelers in the area I finally went in. Should have started with Happy Jewelers because it was hands down the best experience I had over all others. Staff is friendly and knew exactly what I was looking for. They have a ton of quality diamonds and are willing to show you them all if that’s what it takes to find the perfect one. Thank you again to Danny for helping me find the perfect engagement ring!<//Text>

Loved coming here. My sister and I stopped by to take a look at some wedding bands to go with her engagement ring. Nicole helped us and she was amazing. She took her time showing us the variety of rings they have and explained different custom options my sister could choose. It was nice having Nicole help us because she is clearly passionate about jewelry and made great suggestions. Will definitely be back!</review>

I went into Happy Jewelers to find a great gift for my wife. This was our first Christmas being married, so I wanted something special. I explained what I was looking for to Danny, and he gave me a few ideas. He showed me a set of Beautiful diamond earrings that had really great quality diamonds that really Sparkled. Right away I knew I wanted those earring for my wife. I had a budget that I needed to stay within, and Danny helped make that possible. Happy Jewelers always takes great care of us, and their jewelry is always to quality!!! Thank You Happy Jewelers!!</review>

AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE! They go above and beyond! I came in to pick out my wedding band and not only did they fix my engagement ring, clean, and polish it. But they also gave me a loaner band in the mean time while I was waiting for my new rings. I will gladly refer all friends and family here! Can’t wait to come back for more!< /Text>

Happy Jewelers is the best jewelry store we have ever used. 4 years ago, Gabe helped us choose a new diamond band setting for my 23-year old wedding diamond. Absolutely stunning. I have brought friends who received the “family” treatment, too.<//review>

<Text>We Love love love Danny and his team at Happy Jewelers!  My now fiancé and I custom built my engagement ring along with this talented team.  Then 6 months later because I love change they helped me redesign my ring again!   They are all so friendly and helpful.  We’ve actually invited most of them to our destination wedding already.

Happy Jewelers has the best customer service I have encountered! Everyone is always extremely welcoming, friendly, attentive, and professional. Shana was great and helped me pick out a white gold cross and chain. They work with your budget, care about their customers, and are the best in the business. I will definitely continue to come here for all of my jewelry needs and will continue to recommend them to my friends and family... Thank you Happy Team you guys are the best!<//Review>

<Time>1533006636265</Time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Happy Jewelers is the only jewelry shop we will give our business to. They are absolutely amazing! They are a family owned and operated business and it shows. They are warm, friendly and once you shop once, you feel like family as well. Their selection is BEYOND fabulous. I challenge anyone to go there and not find something absolutely beautiful. Jewelry is a very personal and tricky purchase. It's an investment financially and often romantically (lol). So if you want to be treated like royalty, shop with Happy Jewelers. You will not regret it.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Happy Jewelers helped me re-size my engagement ring/wedding band and my husband’s wedding band! They were super helpful/knowledgeable and took a lot of time with us. They also allowed me to come back in to make a minor change to the ring sizing for FREE! Elaine was so kind and sweet and stayed with me the whole time to make sure the fit was exactly what I wanted! I highly recommend them!<//text>< Pictures>

I have come to Happy Jewelers for a number of items in the past couple of years. I have had nothing but exceptional service! I have referred a number of friends and co-workers to Gabe and Danny. The prices are great and the jewelry is of the finest quality. Gabe has designed different rings for my sister and I and we are always getting complements on them. Buying jewelry really gets down to who you trust, especially when it comes to pieces handed down from generation to generation and our family has trust that we are always getting a quality product at a fair price.</text>

<Name>Connor Traut</Name><text>Came in with a budget, told them a lower figure, they found me something for an even lower price. Got it appraised by a different jeweler for about the price I paid so I know they didn’t rip me off either. Good prices, honest people, they won’t urge you to break the bank. Makes sense why they remain so popular.<//text>< userid>

Let me just start by saying 5 stars is not enough for the Happy Jewelers team. They have the most wonderful, helpful, knowledgeable and caring people working there and you can't beat the quality they offer. They go out of their way to ensure their customers get the very best jewelery for their price range. I have recommended Happy Jewelers to many people and will continue to do so. They have a lifelong customer in me, and quite a few people I know. The entire Happy Jewelers team is a true class act! Keep up the phenomenal work!</text>

Both Gabe, Danny, and staff are the most genuine and caring jewelers there ever are. They are less salesmen / salespeople and more jewelry artisans that truly care more for their customers investments than just making a buck. I have been with these guys for almost the last 20 years and recommend them to my entire family wholeheartedly. Our daughters come from out of state when looking to purchase jewelry and exclusively go to Happy Jewelry. They are very knowledgeable and honest about their inventory, and can get almost anything you can think of. And when they can't they'll refer you to any of their resources without hesitation. Honestly who does that? THEY DO...... Another perk I've been enjoying lately is that they do exclusive custom jewelry pieces, of which have become very valuable heirlooms for me and my family. Gabe and Danny treat everyone of their customers as family regardless of the size of your purchase. I've seen this over and over. I work hard for my money and don't take spending lightly. Best investment I can recommend to anyone. Don't believe me? Go check them out for yourself, let the size of the crowd tell you the truth. Some 10-15 vendors @ their venue and they have most of the customers and staff to handle everyone's desire. Love you "Happy Jewelers" signed Happier customer. Lots of love and respect for all your hard work and dedication to what your doing.</text>

Happy Jewelers is amazing! I had the best customer service I have ever had in a long time. The butterfly ring I ordered was even more stunning in person and truly a piece I will always treasure! I am already in talks with Happy Jewelers for future pieces to purchase from them. I will never shop anywhere else for my jewelry! Thank you again for the best service and ring!! 😘< /text>

Went into buy an engagement ring on the recommendation of a buddy. Never bought serious jewelry before let alone been in a jewelry store so I was a bit nervous. To prepare for this purchase, I watched countless YouTube videos and read tons of articles all stating the best tips and tricks to buying engagement rings and diamonds. But to be honest,  nothing prepares you for this kinda thing except experience, which I had none.  Luckily the guys and gals at Happy Jewelers treated me like an old friend and took care of me. They helped me pick out the perfect diamond on the perfect setting, at a great price. I will Desiree be recommending them to anyone I know< /review>

<Review>Happy Jewelers is truly the #1 place to find the most beautiful and up-to-date jewelry. They always have the best selection, quality and prices around. I am so pleased with my diamond heart pendant that my husband purchased from Happy Jewelers.  I receive so many compliments whenever I'm wearing it.

I was made to feel very welcomed, was offered useful advice, and I feel that I was offered a more than reasonable price for my purchase.  As I was leaving, the owner came out to the parking lot to shake my hand and thank me for my business.  Considering that what I spent was probably nothing compared to what most people spend there, it was super cool of him to come out and say thanks in person.

A couple weeks ago, one of the stones chipped. We took it in, and they fixed the problem within a week, at no charge to me. I would highly recommend this place to anybody looking for rings, earrings, watches or other assorted fashion accessories.</Text></record></dataset><record>

As soon as you walk into the Jewelry Mart the first thing you think to yourself is, "Happy Jewelers has more customers at their shop, than the entire store." This is a fact and says a lot about these guys. The first time I heard of this shop is from my friend Trina and my boss Walt, who both buy their jewelry here. They had nothing, but good things to say about the brothers who own the shop (Gabe and Danny) and made comments about them like, "they are the nicest people," and "they are salt of the Earth." Both of these comments proved to be true. I first met them about 1 month and half ago, when Trina took me there to go shopping for my girlfriends (now fiancés) engagement ring. I knew exactly what I wanted and Gabe treated me like an old friend and gave me a very good price on both the engagement ring and the wedding band (I feel like I got the wedding band for free, the price was so good.) All they needed to do was size it and it was mine. That same night I was having some problems and concerns and I was able to call Gabe at 12am at night and he answered the phone and took care of me and made sure that I was getting what I wanted. He understood the anxiety I was having before proposing and just made sure that I would be taken care of in time for my engagment. Gabe kept his word since I have met him and we continue to grow our relationship. I will be buying all my jewelry here for the rest of my life, no matter where I live, cause I'm sure they would mail it to me, so if your not local, don't worry about it. Just call and talk to Gabe and he will help you out. I have so much more to say, but it is getting late and I need to go to bed. BEFORE YOU BUY ANY JEWELRY ANYWHERE ELSE CHECK OUT HAPPY JEWELERS AND THEY WILL BEAT YOUR PRICE. I CAN SAY THIS WITH CONFIDENCE. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE.????< /Text>

This company really cares for their customers and takes pride in the jewelry they have. They are hands down the #1 jeweler I’ve ever experienced and they’ve just gained a lifetime customer. Special thanks to Armida, she did a phenomenal job making sure everything I needed was done perfectly and in a timely manner. Highly recommend to everyone!</Review>

Looking for the perfect engagement ring can be a nightmare. After numerous unpleasant visits to different jewelers, I visited Happy Jewelers and I'm so glad I did. Shana and the Happy Jewelers team was committed in finding me the perfect ring while still working within my budget. Shana worked with great enthusiasm and patience throughout the whole process and we ended up customizing a ring that my fiance absolutely loved. We'll definitely be coming back for the wedding bands. Highly recommend!!!<//review>

Danny and Gabe are top notch, and their staff are superb. They always have our best intrests in mind giving several options without pushing you one way or the other (unless you ask them to). We’ve gotten our engagement ring there, and just got some earrings, and ALL of our friends and family are treated well there too. You can’t go wrong with Happy Jewelers!</Text>

We have been using Happy Jewelers for several years now.  This last time was for a gift for our daughter-in-law who blessed us with a set of identical twin boys.  We went to Gabe and staff for help.  We have moved to Chicago but our trust and loyalty is always going to stay with Happy Jewelers.
Their customer service is so above and beyond.  We were given so much personal attention because we were working long distance.  Nicole was amazing and patient especially going back and forth with pictures and texting.  In the end, our girl had a beautiful set of diamond stud earrings that she loves.
We’re very grateful to Nicole and Gabe.< /Text>

<Review>Best Jeweler in Anaheim!  Danny was the one that assisted me explained everything in detail, great customer service, and ultimately shows genuine interest. For someone that doesn’t know much about diamonds or bands let alone what kind of engagement ring to get, Danny exceeded my expectations and was able to make this an amazing experience. HIGHLY recommended! Thanks Danny!<//Review>< gmapID>

I can't say enough great things about Happy Jewelers. I know how hard it is to find a jeweler that not only does top notch work but to find a jeweler you 100% trust and on top of it beats everyone in prices! Happy Jewelers does all of that! Every time you visit Happy Jewelers you always get a great experience and they keep you wanting to come back for more. This family owned business has figured it out! They put their customers first which is why their repeat clients have been coming to them for years. I have recommended so many people to Happy Jewelers and I have never had one complaint. Thank you Happy Jewelers, you guys are the BEST!!!! Shannon<//Text>

Happy Jewelers is by far the BEST for all your engagement ring desires even upgrades.  We redesigned my wedding ring for our 25th Anniversary.  They did not disappoint.  Design, diamonds, timeframe and price all make you realize why they are called “Happy Jewelers”.<//Review>

Saw Happy Jewelers on Yelp and saw the great reviews specially the reviews about appraisals. My fiancé and I purchased the ring downtown la but decided to go somewhere else for the appraisal and we're so glad we went and saw Gabe. He was very helpful and very honest about the appraisal. All of the other members are also so sweet and willing to help. Definitely recommend Happy Jewelers. Great for appraisals but they also have a great selection!<//review>

Amazing!! Gabe helped me build the exact ring my girlfriend, now fiancé, wanted!! She was so excited and amazed at the beauty and quality, while I was amazed at how well Gabe took care of me! It is rare to get this quality of customer service these days, and I can tell you that These guys are the real deal! They answered every question or concern I had very quickly, and followed through with their promises. I suggest giving them a try, you'll never go anywhere else!< /Review>

<text>Happy Jewelers is th best place to go for any first timers who are looking to buy an engagement ring. Gabe and his team were awesome and very helpful in the process of picking out the perfect ring for the happiest lady who is my fiancé now.😊 I had no clue what to look for since it was a surprise for her, but It was a fun and entertaining experience in picking the right ring with much thanks to Gabe and the team. I did not feel any pressure at all, and I will recommend Happy Jewelers to anyone who is looking to cherish a great moment with their love ones that will be remembered forever. Thank you Happy Jewelers!!!<//text>< pictures>

Shana’s personalized level of customer service is unmatched by anyone in the jewelry industry. She goes out of her way to make sure that you are happy and amazed by the end product. Amazed is probably the wrong word. Breath-taken is more like it.

In this case, the end product was a gorgeous rose gold morganite ring with a split shank and round brilliant cut diamonds on the halo and band. Shana made sure I got a great deal and that I was satisfied.

I am confident to say I have found my jeweler for life. Thank you Shana and thank you Happy Jewels!<//review>

I sent Gabe and his team a design I found on the internet and in just a couple of weeks they custom made my fiance's engagement ring. She loves the ring and was thrilled at the quality and attention to detail. Hayley was great to work with too, sending me pictures and videos of different diamonds and walking me through the process. I could not be more impressed by the level of customer service I received from Happy Jewelers. I can definitely recommend these guys!< /Text>

The only place I will ever buy jewelry! Great customer service and professionalism. Hayley Baray is an excellent jeweler. She is very knowledgeable and goes above and beyond to help you get exactly what you want! Even after my purchase she helped to make sure I was comfortable with the size and style of necklace.< /review>

Had a great experience. I shopped around for price and they were very competitive with everywhere I looked. Not having bought any jewelry before I had no idea what to even look for. Hayley helped answer any question I had and kindly guided me through all of the choices. Being new I wanted to see everything and all of the employees were very patient and helpful. I never felt pushed or rushed at all.</Text>

Only one criticism, we are still waiting for the written appraisal of the women’s Rolex watch we purchased. I Purchased a beautiful gold Rolex watch  with diamines and my fiancé and I purchased our wedding rings and all of the purchases were seamless and easy.  I dealt with Korrin and Gabe and they were both professional, efficient and true to their word. Thank you all. But please send us the appraisal for insurance purposes.<//Review>

Excellent service! I could not be happier with my experience here and the quality of the ring and stone I purchased!  Happy jewlers know their stuff and will not try to hangle you into an impulse decision.  It was a wonderful shopping experience, I will definitely be coming back in the future!<//Review>

My husband has been using Happy Jewelers for over 10 years and they continue to be our go-to jeweler. The service, quality, and professionalism is unbeatable. Gabe and Armida are amazing to work with. The majority of jewelry we have purchased has been custom orders and we couldn't be happier with the results. We have recommended them to a number of friends and family because we trust the quality. Thanks Happy Jewelers for all of the beautiful pieces that we love so much!!</text>

Nicole was amazing and walked me through the whole process of picking out the perfect gift in a timely and professional way.  All my needs were met and she even followed through at the end to make some minor adjustments.  Definitely recommend anyone shopping for diamond needs to go to Happy Jewelers.< /Text>

They are my husband's go to every birthday and holiday for me and I love it.  Happy wife, Happy life, Happy Jewelers!</Text>< Pics>

I've been shopping with Gabe and his team for over 5 years. I found him when he was able to locate a vintage watch I was trying to purchase for my husband. Since then, I've purchased countless pieces with him, including a reset of my engagement ring. Not only am I constantly stopped by people swooning over his beautiful pieces, but he is also a true pleasure to work with. His attention to detail is simply unparalleled, and he always finds a way to envision and create my designs, even when I'm unable to properly articulate them! His entire team is genuinely kind and incredibly knowledgeable. I always enjoy seeing Gabe and his team, and look forward to shopping with them for many years to come! A sincere thank you from our family to yours.</Text>

<Review>One of the most pleasant experiences I had when it came time to pick out an engagement ring. Armida and Elaine were very informative and patient, ensuring not only my confidence in them, but also my decision. If you are looking for an engagement ring, birthday gift, or something just because, I highly recommend shopping here and avoiding the mall crowds or overzealous salespeople at the brand stores.< /Review>< gmapID>

Just wanted to thank you for such a great experience! I went in a year ago to find an engagement ring and Elaine was so much help, she took her time with pairing different stackable pieces. Since then, I have purchased a few pieces and continue to tell friends and family about you guys. You guys have gone above and beyond and will always be my go to jewelers!< /review>

Happy Jewelers cleaned my wedding ring for me and I couldn't be happier! It is only about 2 years old but had lost some of its luster and part of the band was bent. Not only did they fix the bent part but they made it sparkle like new!!! I was so impressed. I can't stop staring at it! Thanks again Happy Jewelers!</Text>

Its gorgeous. When I went in to get it resized the staff was beyond nice and helpful. I got my ring back looking shinier and more beautiful. Overall if you're searching for a jeweler with an abundant amount of knowledge and trust, Happy Jewelry is the place to visit. Everyone is so great and they really work with you so you're happy with product. From here on out this will be our place!</Review>< rate>

First time buyer but couldn’t be more happier. Bought a stud through Instagram and even though I live east coast the delivery came literally next morning of the purchase. And the item is beautiful as well. Will definitely be doing more purchases here for sure.</Text>

Incredible experience. Can't wait to go back for wedding bands. The most pain free and easiest way to find the ring of your special someone's dreams. I will be back and I can guarantee if you go you will be happy too.< /text>

Finding the perfect engagement ring can be both stressful and nerve wrecking. Shana at Happy Jewelers put every worry away. Most importantly she made me feel comfortable. Never pressured me as she showed me about a million different rings I said no to. Her patience and availability at all times of the day, during the week, as well as weekends, is much appreciated.  I’d recommend Shana to anyone looking for the perfect ring for the perfect someone.

Thank you Shana!< /Review>

Happy Jewelers has always given us an A+ experience! The team is truly there for their clients. To meet our needs and to give us the feeling of making our dreams come alive!
Marko and myself have been, time and time again, genuinely impressed with how kind and communicative everyone is.
Always welcoming new folks that approach their vendor table. They ask questions and keep us smiling! A lot!
Also, they give hugs! I love it! I’m a hugger, and so the feeling of connecting that way made our purchase more friendly intimate. The women and men (owners) there are divine! Super knowledgeable in their element. Thank you Gabe and Danny!
I would recommend Happy Jewelers to everyone seeking a beautiful, sentimental piece of jewelry!
My engagement ring, and our wedding bands are absolutely gorgeous!
It was a memorable and exciting buy for us, and I wouldn’t have asked for better service. They are so wonderful!

I went to Happy Jewelers today so that I could get my necklace repaired. I had just gotten off work, and almost didn’t stop by because I was worried I’d have to wait awhile. However, as soon as I approached the counter, I was greeted by Elaine who helped me immediately. I didn’t spend more than 5 minutes waiting! My necklace holds a very high sentimental value to me, and I was worried about the quality of the repair work so I took to Yelp to read few reviews and this place stood out to me. Many of their customers have been with them for years, so I felt comfortable going to Happy Jewelers since they have such a great reputation and rating. The work that was done on my necklace is fantastic and I could not be happier with it. The quality of the repair, paired with the incredible service and treatment I received will definitely keep me going back to Happy Jewelers.</Review>

Last year a good friend and her son recommended Happy Jewelers when they heard that my son was wanting to get engaged! My son dragged me along and we were immediately impressed from the greeting we received! Gabe and Daniel and their staff treated us like we were family from the moment we introduced ourselves! My son picked out a beautiful engagement ring and I walked out with a beautiful retirement gift to myself - a Rolex watch!
Went there this past weekend with my son and future daughter in law to pick out wedding bands. Gabe and Daniel immediately remembered us and we were shown some beautiful wedding bands! The kids got what they wanted from the awesome selection they have! Yes - I walked out with a beautiful Cartier Roadster Watch !! Happy Jewelers is the only place I will go for jewelry from now on!</Text>

I am so picky when it come to real quality & value for the jewelry I buy. I usually drive to downtown LA, fight the horrible traffic and the huge amour of people to get the value & quality that I desire. Now, I have found Happy Jewelers and I could not be happier. Their customer service was beyond my expectations as well as the incredible job making the new setting for my wedding ring for my 20th Anniversary. I never imagined I could have such a beautiful new ring!! Thank you Danny & Gabe for going out of your way to make me much a happy customer. I will NEVER have to go anywhere else again!</Review>

Thank you for the nicest service, I wasn’t sure what Rolex to buy my husband for his birthday and you guys were very patient while I was trying to figure out what i wanted.  You guys are overwhelmingly with lots of nice pieces I definitely need to go back and my husband loved his watch.< /Text>

Gabe is beyond phenomenal both in person and with his products. He truly takes his time in talilor fitting and customizing a spectrum of jewelry to your own taste and style. I bought my wife’s engagement ring , crosses, braclets and other items and the quality was amazing. I referred him over to 6 people so far from family to friends and even clients who truly would appreciate his products, taste and class A customer service. You would also see my testimony when you visit his store and you would see that he is the only one that is extremely busy amongst all the other shops beside him.

Thank you Gabe for all your help.</Review>

<Text>I started buying my jewelry 10 years ago from Happy Jewelers and I'm so happy with all of my pieces. Armida has been such a rockstar! She helps me pick out such beautiful pieces and always finds a way to stay within my budget. Also, I love that this is a family owned store. Danny and Gabe make me feel so comfortable and special.

My Fiancé Beau and I had the best experience!  We were struggling to find a specific wedding band for him and everyone, especially Nicole were patient and helped us design exactly what he wanted! We left there so excited and can not wait to see the finished product in a few weeks. They left us feeling confident that not only will it be exactly what we want, but are willing to accommodate with pictures and shipping since we live in a different state.< /review>

< Review>
I recently bought an engagement ring from Happy Jewelers and they made the whole process of buying and receiving the ring a great experience. I went in there knowing very little about rings and what my fiancée wanted but with their help I was able to design the perfect ring.  They worked with in my budget and showed me so many great diamonds. They made sure to find me the perfect diamond and made the ring very fast. They made the engagement process so fun and exciting and eliminated all my early worries of buying a ring. I wouldn't buy jewelry anywhere else. My fiancée gets so many compliments on all the jewelry I buy from Happy Jewelers and they always have the best quality products. I can now rely on them to make holidays, anniversary, & birthdays so easy for me. Thank you Happy Jewelers for all the amazing jewelry. You guys never disappoint.< /Review>

I can not thank Happy Jewelers enough for the customer service and knowledge behind every piece of jewelery, which made my purchase so easy, thank you. I have to thank The jeweler who made buying a diamond ring easy and painless, Hayley. Such an amazing experience.
Affordable prices
Amazing jewelery
Perfect customer service
And some amazing cookies
I couldn’t ask for more!
Thank you!!<//Review>

<Review>Best experience ever! My mom left me her emerald ring, which wasn't my style and I came in to Happy Jewelers and Gabe worked with me and designed the most amazing rose gold setting for the emerald ring, that I now wear everyday. I can't thank him enough.<//Review>< Pics>

I have thoroughly enjoyed coming to Haopy Jewelers. Every time I need a piece of jewelry they have exactly what I’m looking for and more! All of the workers are amazing and so helpeful. Happy jewelers makes it a point to build a relationship other than making a sale and that makes this store better than any other I have been to.</text>

<Text>Buying jewelry from happy jewelers is a great experience. I purchased a necklace for a friend from Hayley Geer. It was one of my first time buying jelwery and she made the experience comfortable and easy. She was very friendly and worked with me to find the very best deal that I could possibly afford with my budget. She even spent time answering my questions via text when she was off of work. I would highly recommend!!< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>Absolutely the best jewler! My fiancé and I found Happy Jewlers through a friend here in Kansas that used them while living in California. We highly recommend their business. They created the most beautiful rings for our wedding set and engagement ring. Their customer service is exceptional! They make you feel extremely valued and appreciated. We look forward to working with them in the future!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

<review>This is without a doubt the best jewelry buying experience you can have. Gabe, the entire Arik Family, and all of their associates are extremely professional. If there is a piece you are seeking and they do not have it in stock, they will literally custom make it for you to your specifications in their factory. Not to mention their prices are unbeatable. Please, for your own good, make Happy Jewlers your first stop when purchasing a new piece of jewelry... you'll be happy you did.< /review>< pics>

< review>
My fiancé brought my engagement ring through Gabe. He told Gabe exactly what I wanted and he did it! I am in love with it! I had to get it resized, which wasn’t a problem. I live in NY, he sent me the label for overnight shipping and altered the ring for no cost.  It was such an easy process. We recently reached out to him for my wedding band. He took the time to listen to what I want and matched my engagement ring. My set is AMAZING!! I’m marrying my best friend in 5 days and I can’t wait to wear it for the rest of my life. The staff is also super friendly and helpful. Korrin sent me a video of my set when it was ready and answered any questions I had. Happy Jewelers are the best and we will continue to go back for any jewelry in the future!< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I picked up a “push present” for my beautiful girlfriend that Shana helped us get custom made. They got it done within three days and It could not be more perfect. My girl was beyond happy! Their service was stellar and they are all extremely helpful and friendly. They made me feel very welcome and comfortable Since I’m not well versed in purchasing jewelry and very intimidated with the whole process. Shana is by far the epitome of great customer service and immeasurably friendly and curtious. I will absolutely be shopping for jewelry from now on through Happy Jewlery thanks to Shana. Thanks again Shana!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>We've been going to Happy Jeweler's for almost ten years. I've had so many wonderful expierences with Gabe. We have also referred so many friends and family. We always hear great feed back from everyone. Gabe does such a great job at constantly having new and trendy pieces at affordable prices. My favorite is watching his Instagram LIVE to see the next new pieces that have arrived at the store.  I often let Gabe know of my favorite pieces and he takes care of the rest. Meaning getting in touch with my husband. Can't wait for the next time I get to come in and shop! Thanks Happy Jewelers for being the best!<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>My sister is a frequent flyer at HJ. Elaine greeted me right when I walked up, and asked if I wanted to see anything. I was looking at some rose gold studs for my sister's wedding. I was wanted something I could wear day to day, but was appropriate for the wedding as well. I didn't think I was going to walk out with a pair of STUNNING diamond earrings but I did, and I love them! Thanks for the awesome service Happy Jewlers & Elaine!</Text>< pictures>

Happy Jewelers was amazing. When my fiancé was ring shopping a coworker of his recommended them and I’m so glad he did! I’m in love with our rings and the service they provided made the whole wedding planning easier. My engagement ring needed to be resized and they resized it within the hour. Each time we visit, they take my ring to be cleaned while we look for jewelry. Our wedding bands were custom made and they were everything they hoped for them to be. Happy Jewelers will be our only stop for any jewelry needs!<//review>

<Review>Happy Jewelers is the only place I shop! Anytime I'm in the neighborhood, I stop in to have my rings cleaned. I was there recently and a couple of rings caught my eye. Armida was so patient while I decided between the three rings. She even went through the differences and the similarities of each piece. She and the rest of the staff are so knowledgeable and friendly.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>118067272761944768490</user_id>< resp>

<Response>None<//Response><review>I cannot thank Happy Jewelers enough for all of their help with our jewelry purchases. Armida and Gabe are true professionals and most importantly, they know what makes my wife happy when it comes to jewelry!

I did my homework when purchasing my wife's engagement ring and Happy Jewelers really blew the competition out of the water. It was even worth it to take a flight down from SF to LA for the day to make the purchase. Armida was incredible, providing updates and photos throughout the entire process.

I will continue to purchase any and all jewelry through Happy Jewelers and recommend them to friends and family!</review></record>

“It’s easy to find the perfect ring, the difficult part is finding the perfect jeweler.”

Throughout my three month proposal planning adventure, the part I worried about the most became the easiest when I introduced myself to Danny. Our conversation started with talking about my fiancé and how we got to where we are today. He asked me three key questions, budget, size or clarity, and when do you need this by. He brought out 10 different types of diamonds all reasonably within my price point and explained what I need to know about each. He even made me walk outside with the diamonds to see how they shined in the light.  Have no fear if you are an amateur and simply looking to know the proper information. Danny instilled trust, communication and confidence that everything will go right.

Not only did the ring come on time, but it was more perfect than I could imagine. We texted throughout the process and till this day, I cannot believe I didn’t go sooner. I will continue to refer all of My friends and family. There is no question why Happy Jewlers is number one in the OC.<//text>

Happy Jewelers is THE BEST place to get your jewlery! I have been to many places for jewlery and NO ONE will take care of you like Happy Jewelers. I can’t rave about my experience enough! From the minute I started the process they were so attentive every step of the way. You can really see they truly care about you and your wants and needs. They will do anything to make sure you are fully happy with your jewlery! Korrin was the gal that took care of me during it all and wow she was the best! I must have had 100 questions and she was always so sweet. I would text her literally any time of day/night and she made sure to answer all questions I had! She made the whole process amazing and I will send all my friends to her! So thankful we found a family jeweler we can pass down generations.<//review>

I've been always skeptical about ordering online especially such a expensive item such as this but it went smoothly and it was the same watch as the picture I was very very satisfied . Danny made me feel at ease and answered his phone when I called if not he would call me back it's been a pleasure doing business with you. Aloha< /Text>

<Review>I came across Happy Jewelers on Instagram and loved their live videos. I was stun how many customize beautiful ring setting they do. My fiancé (now) and I decide to visit Happy Jewelers to get a customize setting along with finding that beautiful diamond to fit with it. Danny was wonderful!! He explained everything we needed to know about the 4c’s and narrowed down our thoughts on which C’s is more important, that way we can help cut back on some cost. He also took told us that he can customize the ring setting, and if we don’t like it we don’t need to buy it. Along with that he was very good on always getting back to us through text messages on questions we had . He truly made us felt really comfortable like a friend and not just his customer. I can’t wait to go back and pick out the wedding band and future jewelry’s from here!:)

The whole experience was amazing and easy as can be. My fiancé (then gf) would send me dm’s from their instagram of rings she liked, which turned out to be extremely helpful. When it came time to make the purchase I filled out an inquiry and was contacted the next day by Armida. I was on a strict timeline as us guys tend to do everything last minute. She was amazing throughout the process as I really had no idea about anything diamond/ring related. Within a few hours she sent me different pictures of rings, diamonds and costs. I paid over the phone and 8 days later they mailed it to my office. I never had to step foot into a store and my fiancé has not stopped smiling. Recommend happy jewelers to anyone/everyone!</text>

I just picked up my ring about a month ago and I still can't get over how gorgeous it is.  I worked with Shana and she assured me that I could find exactly what I wanted in store. I found a ring I liked but wanted to modify it without the halo on my pear shaped morganite. She said it was no problem and Gabe gave me a price immediately. I went home and couldn't stop thinking about it and came right back and ordered the ring. It was ready 3 weeks later just like she said. When I got the ring it was a little big and they resized it right there on the spot. My friend came with me and Shana wrote down exactly what she wanted and the price on a card so she could come back to her. I can't wait to get some stacker bands. I'm coming right back to Shana. I've gotten so many compliments and I send them immediately to their IG so they can see their rings.< /Text>

< Review>
I moved to California five (5) years ago.  I have a family Jewler in my home state and I needed to find an eternity band for my wife (at the time fiancé).

I could not find anyone, including my family jewler back home, who could help me in the time I needed, with my particularly challenging requirements, or for what I considered a fair price (I know my diamonds for a lay person).

I was recommended to Happy Jewlers by a colleague and couldn’t have been happier. Not only did Happy Jewlers come through for me in a way I never thought a Jewler would, they have continued to take care of me, my wife, my sister, and mother-in-law as well.

Since the original wedding band years ago, we have gone through 2 upgrades, diamond studs, a new wedding band for me, a second pair of diamond earrings, a diamond tennis bracelet, a second gold bracelet with a diamond disk, matching necklace, a new wedding band for my mother-in-law, a beautiful engagement ring for my sister, and more.

I honestly could not speak more highly of the quality, customer service, professionalism, or all around experience I get with Happy Jewlers.  Whether you’re local or across the country, Happy is there for you.

I’m not sure who should be more grateful for the referral years ago, me or Happy Jewlers. We’re hooked!!!<//Review>

< Review>
My fiancé proposed to me with the most beautiful ring I could have dreamed of. He worked with the jeweler to design me a custom ring. He proposed to me in the dark, and when he got down on one knee and opened the box, it lit up the ring and sparkled. Every detail that my finance and jewler took to make that evening memorable and perfect was taken into consideration. I highly recommend using them as your jeweler. We don’t even live in California, and they made it feel like we have known them forever. When it came to customizing my fiancé’s wedding band, I got a call from Nicole, who was incredibly sweet. She was so excited for us, you could hear it in her voice. Felt like I was talking to my best friend who was excited for me to receive a gift in the mail. Happy  Jewelers goes above and beyond. I will recommend you all to everyone I know.

Ps. I still place my ring in the lit up box when I work out. And every time I open it up, it reminds me of the day he proposed. Thank you for still creating wonderful memories.</Review>
