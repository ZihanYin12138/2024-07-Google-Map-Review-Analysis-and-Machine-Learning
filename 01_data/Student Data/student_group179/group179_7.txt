<review>Love the whiskey selection here. Bartender seems knowledgable. Retracting glass roof gives it an airy, open vibe.</review>< pics>

<Review>I've been meaning to try this spot since I first got my job in the area months ago. I'm so glad I did because it was fantastic! It's a trendy, hipster type spot that specializes in sliders and salads. I can't blame em', this place is delicious. I initially ordered to go as my lunch break is typically short, but once the food arrived, I decided to stick around as I really enjoyed the vibe and figured I can take a longer lunch just this once.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< Pictures>

<Review>I really like the brunch they have at Marengo.  First off, the mimosas and bloody mary's are terrific here. The food is well made and service has always been friendly and fun.  The back room has big skylights and opens up so is a lot of fun on a sunny day (while still inside).  Marengo will get crowded, especially on a nice weekend so its good to get there earlier for brunch.  The back bar will also fill up but it is always a fun time.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Eye candy is usually pretty promising and making out with strangers is not so irregular here. While, it's a great spot to socialize it's my go to for Einstök beer when feeling nostalgic for Iceland. Their salads are great and the loaded queso is fire! The chicken jerk salad is spicy and hearty. The small salads are still massive for one person. The large is big enough to split with a friend. Sliders are delicious and big selection to pick from. It's a must for visitors from the other side of the pound so they can try a chicken waffle slider. I promise they're going to be excited because this combo is just bizarre to anyone other than Americans.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I've been to the place a couple of times to get whiskey drinks. I really recommend the whiskey bar at the back,  great drinks and nice ambience.

One of the highlights is that it's a bit hidden in the back so it's less crowded than other bars in the area. Although I'd say they could do a better job at adversiting the spot - it's hard to find unless you know it's there.<//Text>< pics>

I dig! Randomly stumbled upon here with a friend one night and it turns out that their kitchen was closing, but the manager or owner spoke with the kitchen staff and said that it was okay for us to order food if we wanted, which was very nice of them. I've only done drinks and snacks here, but the full menu looks good as well.  Love their whiskey cocktails menu, and their sliders and queso dip are very good.</Text>

Was here during the Union Street festival. Good space, drinks were good and the back patio is nice on a sunny/warm day. The coolest thing about it is that it's got a retractable roof, so even if it's a nice day but windy, you can still enjoy the sun and stay away from the breeze. Will have to come back sometime during regular business hours and perhaps add to this review...< /Text>

I find Marengo to be hit or miss. Some of their food and sliders are AWESOME, some are just ok. The prices are a bit ridiculous for what it is, but this is the Marina. The ambiance can be nice though and it's not a bad place to catch a game.</text>

<text>I just ordered 4 fried rices to go and when I got home I was very disappointed. My tofu fried rice was simply big chunks of white rice with a little bit of onion and few pieces of tofu. So disappointed. I paid $48 plus $7 tip. What a rip off!!</text>< rate>

Won't be returning any time soon. Tables outside dusty plus they took long to take our order. When our order came all. The food was in Styrofoam containers it was awkward to enjoy the food in these containers. Plus food portions smaller. The owner raised her prices NO MORE Lunch special and all dishes $10.00 plus not worth the wait or pay for smaller portions. Spend $40 on 2 lunches WON'T BE RETURNING.<//Text>

<text>The prices are different than online. Very expensive, not worth the price we had to pay. We ordered chicken skewers because we thought it would be 7, but it turned it to be 9, fried rice was 12, but it was actually 15 in stores, etc.
Also they blatantly lied about their sticky rice bring cooked in banana leafs. So that's not really cool.
I won't be coming back in the future.

Garlic rice was good though. So I guess you can go order that?</text><response>None</response><userid>116290156420278300347< /userid></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>This was my very first time dining here. The food was delicious. We ordered the Green curry with shrimp, and egg rolls. The food from the very first bite til the end was full of traditional Thai flavors that was very satisfying to my pallet. The customer service was excellent and the wait for appetizers and main dish wasn't long at all.< /review>< pics>

The Hollywood Pad Thai dish was so delicious, moist, and sweet; you will not be able to stop eating it!  I ordered the Glass Noodle dish at a medium heat level, but it was too spicy for me. The broth in the glass Noodle was comfort food nirvana. The Panang curry was coconut heaven. The Glass Noodle dish didn't have much protein, so order more if your expecting more protein ratios. Overall, a delightful neighborhood family business that I will visit again and again.</text>

It's alright. Very mom and pop in its ambiance. That is to say that the interior isn't as inviting as the food.

Generally haven't had time to sit down for a meal but do like to order sides when I go for walks. They're pretty good. Have had the wontons, orange chicken and fried rice.

I can't speak on the service when sitting down or the plating, but they are very amiable whenever I do come in to order takeout.</Review>

<Review>My favorite Thai noodle spot in town. It saves me time from driving all the way to Thai Town to get decent authentic Thai noodles. Dishes I recommend are The Hollywood Noodle soup, Thai Boat noodle soup, Chinese broccoli with crispy pork and Fried wontons. Be careful when choosing your spicy level, they tend to be more on the hot side, so if you normally get mild, ask for medium and if you normally get hot, try out their medium first.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><date>1575091184950</date>< user_id>

This is surprisingly one of the best Thai food place I know of. It's one of the hole in a wall that most people don't seem to know . Their food is less Americanized than let's say president Thai. Here are few item we tried :
-Crispy pork with Chinese broccoli. Definitely better than many other place where the pork is too hard. In alot of the places my jaw will be tired from chewing the pork and this place has done it right where it's actually crispy , not hard.
-Chicken pad Thai : good portion and not too sweet with a good flavor . Nothing too special here but still definitely good.
- beef Penang. I only tried a little bit of this one since I can't really eat spicy , but my party members definitely impressed by it as it's not too sweet and has a really nice spices scent .

Price is reasonable where the three dishes I mentioned cost me $35 after tax on June 2019.
So average food was about $10 which is really reasonable in these day.

Place is kinda hard to find since they don't have good signage . I've been here before and still wasn't sure if this place has changed name or not since I can't see the restaurant name from the street when you drive by it.</text>

<review>Service was friendly,  the food we had was really really good (green curry with tofu and the other fish was eggplant basil with tofu).

The restroom could use some updating. The music is a little softer than at other restaurants but I'd still prefer it even more soft (that may be a personal preference).<//review><date>1504492809239</date><pictures>None< /pictures>< user>

Went in for dinner, only my mom and I and one other table with 3 customers. Please come visit this hidden gem! We ordered boat noodle, Tom yum noodle soup, and hoy tod aka fried muscles. Prices were reasonable, portions were decent for price, but best part was the flavor. Hard to find a good Thai restaurant outside of Hollywood. Make this your next Thai night out 😉.< /Review>

<review>First time here.
Ordered Prik King, orange chicken, shrimp chow mein, seafood soup (lemon grass).
Great price range, large selection of dishes, very friendly staff and best of all, the food was amazing!
Ordered more to go as well.
There were a lot of people coming and going for take out.  The dining room was nice and quiet.
Come and try it!<//review>< pics>

<Review>Delicious and authentic Thai food. I had the boat noodle and my girlfriend had the Hollywood noodle dry. As a Thai person I've been on the lookout for Thai food in this area and now I've found it. Owners are super nice and I will definitely be back.< /Review>< Rating>

I really liked their omelette because it has a variety of choices. In addition, I absolutely loved their orange juice. It was amazingly fresh and very pulpy.

The cafe is conveniently located closer to 101 highway. The cafe is open 7 days per week.
I'm going back there soon!</Text>

<Review>Impressive traditional American breakfast. Easily under $10 a person and they give you a to-go coffee when you leave. Food quality is great. Eggs are good, pancakes are light and fluffy too. Can't go wrong with this place. Not recommended for groups larger than 8 due to the popularity of this place (you'll have a hard time getting enough tables and chairs together). Only bummer is that it closes at 3pm. Should be a 24 hour breakfast joint IMO.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80e849e34468bdb1:0x5c0d98cd20be69dc<//gmapID></record>

I wanted to order the chicken fried steak and eggs. Good ones seem to be hard to come by. Instead I ordered the Chile Verde omelette. It was small. I asked for beans instead of potatoes. They were pinto, not refried, and cold. The Mexican cooks here don't know how to serve a Mexican Dish.</review>

I'd like to be able to comment on the food, but we've been waiting for over an hour and still nothing... Food's here... Chorizo and egg burrito is pretty good. Not worth the hour long wait. Still waiting on the the correct order for my son... This sucks!</Text>

I like breakfast cafe. It's great when you eat in. When I order to go it's not as good. They don't really know how to cook eggs. I order over easy and I get over medium or over hard and scrambled eggs are more like chopped up omlett. But it's cheap and they have the best bacon!!!< /text>

Once upon a time my wife and I were regular customers, the food was average as were the portions, but the cost was good.  However with dividing the resteraunt in half, the place is much more crowded, and as soft drink refills are not free, we spend the same for larger portions better food and better parking down the street.<//text>

Very poor service! My friend wanted to wash his hands after changing a tire in the parking lot but was refused with the words ‘for customers only‘. Don‘t know anything about the food but to be a good restaurant the staff should be more attentive< /text>

<Review>Used to be the best breakfast place in Camarillo. I always stopped for breakfast when driving from Ventura to LA.
New owner doesn't have much of a clue.
Went there Wednesday 8-15-18.
No menu on the wall behind the counter like before, , just small menus with print sized for a ant to read. I didn't take my glasses in with me so couldn't read it and just told the gal,  2 eggs,  2 sausage, 2 bacon and potatoes and OJ.
She rang me up and handed me a empty coffee mug. I told her I want the OJ in a glass. She apologized and got me a glass.
I went outside to find a table.
There were 7 or 8 tables and I passed 4 before I found one that had been cleaned after the last customers. When the breakfast came it was 2 eggs and 4 bacon.
Didn't want to wait for it to be fixed so just finished it.
Overall food is OK but way overpriced,  especially with Dennies and Ihop just down the street. OJ was good. Gal has a problem listening.
I don't think I will go there again.<//Review>< Rating>

< review>
this used to be my absolute favorite breakfast place, looks like new owners took over it has completely gone down. service is bad, food takes long, they raised the prices. last time they forgot our toast on the breakfast special. The aura has changed, this was really heartbreaking used to be a genuine mom and pop spot to get a non overpriced good breakfast. Food doesnt taste the same looks sloppy and like they cooked it in dirty pans</review>

Went their and was not a good experience and you have to pay for 50 cents for a little container of jalapenos. The meat was super dry and stale. It's like they recooked it. It needed more dedication. Long waits and great food beats quick and cheap foods any day and twice on Sunday. Be nice to your taste buds and take them somewhere else, like IHOP or Denny's. Price is okay.</review>

The only reason I have been here two times is because it is really close to the gym. Will never come here again.< /Text><date>1456602112078< /date>< pics>

Hello all,
All the reviews you see in 5 stars rating are fake all that 5 stars rating from their employee, bunch girls working there are liar, I believed they don't want to liar but owner Corinne force them to liars, they liars everything they can and most their liars not making any sense. Their products made from Plaster and cheap resin and no warranty, all the foam using mot of them from carpet underpayment material. don't be pool to buy product by the look come to their warehouse and you can see there are 2 guys repairing all day long. We are retailer to selling their products all merchandise damaged  and they used wood bondo and wood filter  to cover their damaged and resell them as new one again, as soon as we pick up merchandise we have to sign to release liability and that is it (you on your own). There is many company made much better stuff than Homey Design. Look at the pictures Homey design products made from Styrofoam for dining table leg and chairs< /text>

Horrible service and unacceptable furniture quality. My coworkers and I went to pick up furniture from their warehouse and almost every piece came chipped and damaged. The structure of their furniture is beautiful but the quality is very bad. Stay away from this company if you don’t want your furniture coming in damaged.</Text>

<Review>I’ve been purchasing from Homey Designs for over 10 years. Never have I had any of the issues that others claim to have in their negative reviews. I am a business owner and retail home furnishings. Things rarely arrive perfect from any supplier and when you’ve been in the business as long as I have, you’ve seen it all. I find Homey Design’s quality, designs & their staff to be wonderful and i’ve experienced  their reps who go above and beyond to help my brick and mortar business work despite the internet companies out there, our governments tariff fight overseas and increasing freight costs left and right.

Don’t believe the haters or wannabe drop shippers who don’t really understand how business is. Homey Design is a great company to work with if you want unique styles at a great value for your clients.

P.S. I received no compensation for this review and I’m not a fake person either ...  Just believe the good people at Homey Design deserve to hear from people who do believe they are doing wholesale right.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Rating>5</Rating>< Name>

I purchased a beautiful bedroom set that exceeded my expectations, I am extremely happy with the product. The wood and the fabric is rich in color and stands out in my home. I look forward to working with this company to furnish my entire home. The customer service department was very helpful.<//Text>

Got their furniture delivered 3 weeks ago. Headboard has nails pop all over it. Dresser drawers are all messed up. You'have to pull them out real hard then good luck getring them to close. I called the store where i bought the furniture from " Elegant Furniture " in Houston, TX. That guy never returned my call. Ive called the store about 7 - 8 times. Anyway long story short this company's furniture is very ghetto. Don't be fooled with the catalogue look.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>KEEP AWAY!! This company is fake. I wired over $18500 for furniture, they sent damaged goods and refused to change it, do not be fooled by the pictures. They will not give you any other options to pay because people already disputed the cc charges. you will regret it, ema and mia and Ashley are crooks. Im am not one to badmouth people but i lost so much money because of this companys ignorance and low standards. Keep away please.</review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>DO NOT BUY!!! It will be a purchase you will regret. We run a family owned furniture business out of Memphis, TN & we spent over $13,000 with this company and have not received all the pieces we ordered. We reported this to the company and they have been giving us the run-around and have been dodging our calls, emails, faxes, etc, something I have never experienced with any of the other vendors we've dealt w/over the years. This was our 1st time however ordering from Homey Design , but DEFINITELY the last. This nightmare has been going on for about a month now. We were trying to service a very special customer of ours who was looking for mansion quality furniture which is how Homey Design advertised their product. Fast forward to today and we are now being sued by our customer because for about a month she has had a bed w/no footboard and it's not the type of bed that could function without a footboard, missing dresser for the mirror and shoddy quality on the dining room chairs for the order</Text><Time>1538758599077</Time>< user_name>

< review>
I ordered two products on Wed Aug 22 10:38:47 2012.  It is now Friday, *September* 14, 2012.  I have not seen the products.  I have called, but no answer.  I have used the "Contact Us" email to no avail.  No products.  No assistance.  I think this is VERY poor service indeed.  I will never order from Julian Bakery again, and will boycott their products in the stores.

So...I received my order on Sept18.  The bread was completely covered in mold.  I have called, I have emailed, and still no response from *ANYONE* at this company.  This is the WORST business practice I have ever seen.  I don't know who's running this place and I no longer even care to bother finding out.  I just hope that whoever you are, that you get what you deserve.  Bankruptcy.< /review>

I placed my second order 7/23 and still have not received as of 8/6.  I e-mailed twice to find out when my order would deliver and got no response.  I called 8/6 and finally hung up after holding for over seven minutes. The bread is good/healthy but they need to learn to manage the business. The customer service (no service) is terrible.

If they can't deliver one of their competitors will duplicate the product and put them out of business with some sort of service.< /review>

<date>1381348495792</date><rating>2< /rating><Review>My family loves the macaroons and my son uses the wraps all the time for school (amazing for a 12 year old).  I ordered those with some of the waffles to try ... in August.  I just received them today (October).  I do understand that some things are made to order, so that shipping is slower than average - but almost two months is ridiculous.  I was notified it shipped and then nothing after that.  Whenever I wrote them, they did respond quickly but no explanation what happened to the order, and then I was told it would ship next day (it didn't) and finally after my third follow up the order arrived today without warning.  Despite all of this, there was no offer or discount - not even an "I'm sorry" written on the invoice or coupon toward a future purchase.

It's truly unfortunate that their product handling is so poor, because some of their products are excellent - especially in this niche market.  However after this last experience I would rather try to find a local distributor and buy direct if I was able.  If not, I'll just go without.  I do not think I would order online from them again.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
It took a long time to get an email on my shipping status, and longer for my package to actually arrive (East Coast delivery). I've heard the Almond bread is good, but DO NOT order the Coconut bread. You can't use this for anything, it's wet, falls apart to the touch, and there's a strange odor to it. I will not be ordering from Julian's Bakery. Especially given the delivery time and quality of service. Unless you live in the same city as the bakery, you should stay away and just be healthy without it.< /Review>

<Text>I have been a Julian Bakery customer for about 5 years, I live on the southeast coast. For years I ordered  6 loaves on a Friday and usually received them the next Friday, if not by Tues.the following week. Customer service has always been great, until July. It took almost a month to receive bread! I reordered a week later on Aug. 24th. I have yet to hear anything. It's usually 3 days after you receive a confirmation email. The customer service has always been great, been able to talk to someone on the phone. I can only think that now maybe demand has been so great that they're having trouble keeping up? I still believe that Julian Bakery puts out a great product, I can only hope that they transition to cover needs. I haven't given up yet. A Whole Foods store is scheduled to open up in town next month, I hope they'll carry the bread.< /Text><name>Pegi Nelson<//name><pics>None</pics><Rating>4</Rating>< Response>

I ordered 6 loaves of bread on November 5, 2012. I still have not received them and Julian Bakery already has my money. Left 3 voicemail messages for them to call me and to date no call. Also sent 2 emails and no response yet either. My advice to you is do not order from this company. They will take your money and wont send your bread</review>

I had originally bought the smart carb bread.  It was ideal for me as I am very sensitive to a lot of the wheat breads out there.  It was very good.  Toasted so well.  Then there was this "nutrient listing" problem and they changed the original recipe.  So I went to the Sour Dough which turned out to be pretty good.  Then they decided to discontinue the Sour Dough and when it came back out it was horrible.  No one would eat this bread.  Now, being an ex business person the usual goal of a company is to improve with every offering.  This company turns it around and goes backward with every new product.  Even where I buy my breads locally quit carrying these items as no one liked any of the products anymore.  What happened?  Why can't you go back to the drawing board and make the original versions.  I am sure you can't be making any money except on the few people that haven't tried it or people with no taste buds.  When I called I was told that they are helping people with gluten issues.  Well, there are a lot of breads out there that are gluten free and they taste a whole lot better than these breads.  Bring the old ones back.  Please.<//text>

I can't attest to the quality or appeal as I am still waiting to receive my order. I placed an order on July 18 and am still waiting. My first email to them inquiring about my order was answered with a polite explanation about them not anticipating the demand. I can accept that. What I don't accept is being told my bread would ship no later than August 1 and it didn't arrive on August 3. I sent another email and was told my bread would be shipped  August 6. Monday came and went and no notification of shipment. I sent another email on August 7 to which I have yet to receive a reply. I also tried calling today and got  voice mail. I left a message with my phone number and expressed my desire to cancel my order and get a refund. No reply. I just sent another email expressing my desire to cancel and get a refund. At this point, I don't care how good the bread is....I'm tired of waiting and just want my money back!!<//text>

Love their bread, i order smart carb and amazing sourdough. I toast them or make a grilled cheese with low calorie cheese. THEY taste amazing toasted. I read some comments of people waiting long periods of time for their bread, but i have never waited more than a week. I keep a couple loaves in the freezer and one loaf in the fridge and it lasts in my fridge for weeks. LOVE LOVE LOVE this company. I will continue to order and maintain my low carb lifestyle.< /Review>

Customer service is terrible!  The last two times I've placed an order, I was notified it was shipped but yet no tracking information was ever loaded against the tracking number nor did I receive my order within two weeks time.  I sent several emails each time requesting updated status but received no response.  I eventually called their customer service number and after two days of no answer and leaving multiple messages with no return calls, someone finally answered.  I was informed that my orders didn't ship because several of my items were on backorder.  I was given the choice to wait for the items to come in or to remove those items from my orders, so the rest of the order could be shipped.  I chose to remove those items from my order.  I didn't receive any type of shipping information or status and my orders weren't shipped using the same tracking numbers.  I received the first order two weeks later and the second a week later.  While I understand items sell and may be on backorder, I don't understand why it's so hard for the employees to communicate such issues right away instead of me having to hunt them down for assistance.  Assigning a tracking number and processing the orders for shipment prior to actually filling the orders is a very backwards and bad way of doing business.  Timely and accurate communication with customers is key and needs to be vastly improved.  Their products are great but their customer service is horrible.<//review>

<Text>I gave them one star because I could not select 0. I am Paleo and was very excited about getting my bread and waffles. I placed my order and waited two weeks. Nothing...So I called to check on it and had to leave a message. One week later I still had not heard from them so I sent an email. I finally received a response that said they are sorry for the delay but their waffle machine was broken and the order would be sent out soon. I sent a reply back very upset asking why they had not let me know what was going on. No response again...So I called back and actually got someone on the phone. It was a young guy who said he was aware of the problem. I asked him why no one had returned my phone call. He said they were a small business and there is only one girl returning the calls and she is very busy with angry customers. This is no excuse I told him. I am also a small business owner and our top priority is our customer service. I asked him could they not have just sent out a mass email letting everyone know of the problem. He told me I should speak with the owner. I asked for his phone number and he said it would be better to email him. I should have just pulled over and taken his email right then because the young guy said he would email me his email address and he never did. He also told me that he would include an extra loaf of bread for my troubles....only because I asked...and by asked I mean demanded. Of course here comes my order a month later now with no extra loaf of bread. Although it would not have really mattered because almost the entire order was moldy anyway. Needless to say they will not be getting any more business from me. It is business like this that give customer service a bad name.<//Text>< Rating>

Just like Grace S below, I had the same experience. I got the same response that after these years and loaves purchased, they won't fix the problem. I understand it would be a financial hardship. Perhaps they could send a loaf a month to fix it for us. Do they really want to lose our business. At this point, until they can fix the problem, I'm not purchasing another loaf. I returned the remaining 5 loaves without an RA #, so I probably just threw away the $18 in postage as well as the bread. Julian Bakery, if you don't fix this for the people who were loyal to you, SHAME ON YOU!!!< /Text>

<text>I felt the need to say something after reading all the negative reviews here lately. I'm a fitness/health nut. I don't eat anything made of flour or starch not because of allergens or disease, but because I simply want to be putting more nutritious things into my body. That said, who doesn't love bread? I found Julian's bakery about 2-3 years ago, and they are the only reason I have bread in my life to this day. I've tried probably all of their variations, and they're all winners to me. I'm not a picky person when it comes to taste, I understand there's a slight sacrifice you make when choosing health food alternatives, but considering the nutritional profile of these breads, I think they're AMAZING. I could not be more grateful that this company exists. Some of their breads are a bit better than others (the paleos tend to go bad super fast and sometimes taste odd), but some are downright delicious. Know what you're buying and don't expect it to taste like a loaf of fresh sourdough, appreciate it for what it is.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I saw this great product unfortunately I didn't read the reviews first.  Ugh, ordered two loaves of bread.......shipping alone was 12.00!!
Bread is really not edible.  Spongy, does not toast or get crispy.  Would not recommend this to anyone.  Will make a note to facebook!</Review>

<review>I had a large order for $160 with Julian Bakery in May 2012.  Some products were edible some were just horrible and wound up in the trash.  I had ordered protein bars that were individually wrapped and I contact Julian bakery cause they tasted horrible and told them I believe they were bad.  Several emails and phone calls went back and forth with Olga Perez who had stated if I sent the case of bars back they would refund me the purchase price as well as the shipping cost to ship back.  The tracked package was received by Julian bakery confirmed by the them as well as the post office.  Every month, I checked my statement and the credit of $36.67 never posted.  Every month Olga promised a credit.  We are now almost at the end of  January of 2013, and the credit still has not posted.  After this last email that I sent the  beginning of January Olga forwards me to a Joe Gomez who is suppose to credit my account.  He contacted me by phone and did nothing but give me the run around instead of just saying sorry for all these months that we have not credited you back $36.67 for the product that we received back that was bad. Instead i get told he has to talk to the owner.  Where was the owner while this was going on for 8 months.   I am now going through my credit card to get this refunded.  Stay far away from this company they have terrible customer service and 90% of their products are not edible.  The 10% that were edible I probably would have still purchased from them, but not after this whole experience they lost me and several of my family and friends for just $36 bucks.  Oh well what a shame.  I doubt they will be around much longer.</review></record></dataset><record>

I had been so excited and patiently waiting for my bread and received it over a month after I ordered it, got the same email that others have and also was not able to get through on the phone or receive a return call either.  When it arrived it was all molded and I was there when UPS dropped it off.  Since then I have left two emails and two voice mails and have heard nothing back.  Still hoping I will eventually get my loaves since I did pay for them quite a long time ago and have yet to try it. Very disappointed.

Julian Bakery offers a great product but they are apparently unable to keep up with demand. After being treated like the other reviewers I decided to cancel my monthly order of 6 loaves. Their phone goes straight to voice mail and when I email them I get no response. Maybe my order cancellation will help the previous reviewer get their bread sooner. If you order beware that they charge your credit card immediately and you will wait weeks if not over a month before they ship your order.

---UPDATE---
Requested a refund and received an email the next day stating they will send my request to their accounting department and I should receive it within 7 days.  We will see if they can process a refund within the 7 days otherwise this transaction is going to become a dispute with VISA.</Review>

Sure, their products are "appealing." I was VERY excited about their primal bread. However, when I received it (much later than promised, though I'm aware that happens and that's not the issue), both loaves were rotten. Smelled as though something died in the bag.

I'm an easy going guy. I realize things happen, it's a newer product, etc. So I contacted them, and asked for some help. I even said maybe it was UPS's fault. Nothing back. Emailed again. Nothing. Posted on their Facebook wall... removed a few minutes later. Emailed again, demanded my money back. Nothing. No email, no refund... nothing.

I was so excited to use their products that I even shared their site with a number of friends that I know would like it too. I had to apologize to them after this. I can NOT believe someone thinks they can run a business this way.

I so wish I could be giving a 3/3/3 review, but now I have to say: avoid this company like the plague. Simple customer service would have won me over for life. Too bad.<//text>

<Text>It's nice to find a grain free bread, opens up so many new options for what I can eat.  But, sadly, I've just had too many poor experiences with the company/customer service.  This time around, I placed my order September 6, and still haven't received it. (it's October 7th)  When they finally did respond to all my emails they assured me it would arrive last Friday (it didn't)  Sent them several emails, and now I'm told it will be here tomorrow (I'm skeptical.)  Didn't offer a discount or to waive shipping charges, or much of an apology.

When you're charging a premium price, you should offer premium service.  Mistakes happen, but when they do, apologize, and make it right.  People shouldn't have to wait over a month for something that's a staple in their diet, with no apology or explanation, and still pay $15 shipping.

I think I'm going to try my hand at home-made paleo bread!</Text>< response>

I have lost weight and my cholesteral is down and I can't find it or anything like it where I live.  Yes, it takes a little planning in order not to run out - and - it is more than $1.00 per loaf, but what doesn't?

The bread was not worth the wait. Here's what I just emailed to them:

{I was your victim #8175 (my order number). What a waste of my hard earned money. Your Smart Carb #1 bread was expensive, tasteless, and rubbery. Even our dogs wouldn't eat it, and they aren't very picky. Thats' the last time I spend over $17.00 for a loaf of bread . I want my money back!}

I'm guessing I won't hear from them. I should have done more research. Live and learn.</Review>

Can i give ZERO stars?  I ordered two loaves from Julians - the gluten free cinnamon and the gluten free regular.  Took forever to receive, first of all.  I was fine with that, if the bread was delicious.  I received both loaves yesterday and tried a slice of each.  It was so bad I had to spit it out.  It is inedible.  Vile.  I don't know how they can sell it for human consumption.  I have heard they don't give any refunds, so lesson learned I guess.  Whatever you do, do not order any of Julian's bread.   I still shudder thinking about the taste.  Yuck.<//Review>

I wish I had read the reviews that others posted here.This is the worse bakery to order from. I placed an order over a month ago and never got the items. I called them 3 times and left voicemails; they never bothered to call me back and the other 2 times when they picked up the phone they just couldn't give me a reasonable explanation about what happened to my package. What an unprofessional place. Horrible Horrible experience.< /Review>

WOW...I'm hooked on your bread!! Smart Carb #1 is truly nutritious, every athlete's dream. I gave up eating bread all together after trying your bread. It's been five months now since getting started on the Smart Carb #1, and there's no going back to regular bread!! I get a big shipment to Florida every two months, worth every penny!! Keep up the great work Julian Bakery :)</Text>

DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE!

OMG!  I SHOULD have checked out Yelp or Google Maps for reviews before succumbing to the obviously fake reviews on the Julian Bakery site.

I ordered TEN loaves of the CarbZero because a gazillion people RAVED over it over at the bakery's website.  ALL of them were full of MOLD and disgusting.   I phoned the bakery and requested a return label to ship it all back and they said to destroy it and they would replace it.

I told them I had no interest in the bread and wanted a refund. My dad wouldn't even let me put them in our trash. I was told "we don't issue refunds".  HA!  So, I wrote them an email and told them they had 3 days to refund my money or I would dispute it with VISA.  Nobody ever replied.

Only due to Visa did I get my refund.</Text>

We enjoyed your previos formula for low carb #1. Your new formula is not edible. Given the number of reviews begging you to go back to the previous formula, I would think that it would be profitable for you to offer it as another option. When you do, we will be back as a customer.</review>

I am in the same boat as recent posters. So disappointed, because the idea of having very low to no carb bread is like a dream come true. I have now waited for more than three weeks. After about ten days I emailed and received a thoughtful, apologetic response. I appreciated that. I was told in that email that my order would ship no later than August 1. It is now August 8. Two days ago I emailed again, politely, and received no response. Emailed again, got a "form letter" response, explaining that my order would be filled within 14 days (this, after my order was already 13 days late).
I am not giving up yet. I hope they will come through and that the bread will be good. In the meantime, I seriously encourage everyone to try and find a local/regional store that carries Julian Bakery Bread and buy it there. If I had known what trouble mail ordering would be I would have called ahead to a nearby city and if they had any in stock, I would have driven there to purchase.

I agree with another poster that this company has one of the GREATEST ideas ever. There are so many people who are needing to eliminate carbs for various reasons and the bread is beyond welcome to millions. Julian could CLEAN UP but they won't if their customer service continues in this manner.

In the email that was sent to me a couple of weeks ago, the writer explained that they did not anticipate such an enormous response. Fair enough, and if I must wait through an initial backlog, that is fine. But to ignore my polite requests for an update -- this is what is going to drive their business into the ground. If there are problems, just let me know, don't ignore your customers, especially when you already have their money!<//review>

<text>I have been purchasing the Smart Carb #2 for the last two years. The "new" recipe is rubbery, hard to bite off and lacks taste.  I know the people in La Jolla might like it, but please go back to the original loaf.  If not I will have to say good bye....< /text>< response>

<review>I don't know what happened here.  I used to by lots of the low carb breads from Julian and really liked them-especially the cinnamon raisin and the 1 net carb sandwich bread.  Several months ago, everything changed.  The bread tastes awful- it's very rubbery-almost inedible.  I can hardly believe it.  I can't force myself to eat what I've already purchased and frozen.  Does anybody know why they nose-dived on something that used to be at least decent and edible?????<//review>< user_id>

< Review>
At first I was telling all of my friends about Julian Bakery as they offer so many options for people on special diets.  But I have had 3 orders of bread show up spoiled, even after paying each time for UPS 2nd day air delivery.  I have called and emailed Julian Bakery 4 or 5 times now and have never received a call back or an email reply.  I'm extremely disappointed.  I should be refunded for these purchases.  I would not recommend this company to anyone that cannot buy their product locally in a store.< /Review>

After reading the label, and doing research, I discovered this isn't even close to low carb.  Hopefully someone isn't seriously sickened by eating this!< /Review>

< Review>
so I made my first purchase online recently. I ordered quite a few items all at once. When I received my order, one of my items was incorrect. I ordered "Primal Cravings" by Megan & Brandon Keatley that I was beyond excited about receiving & instead received some weird Paleo book that I could care less about. So I left a message & their contact page on the Julian Bakery website. Later that morning, Allie called & said they would be glad to ship the correct book I ordered, "Primal Cravings", but first I need to ship them the back I didn't order. I understand, I didn't order this book. I was shocked that they even thought it was normal for me to pay for shipping on their mistake they made. The best part of all is that she wanted me to see if I still had the order receipt to see who initialed so that it would help her identify who packaged my order. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter who made the mistake, it is about moving on & fixing the mistake that really matters & making the customer happy. That to me shows complete lack of customer service. With my busy schedule, it is much easier for me just to order & pay for the book again on Amazon instead of driving up to a shipping store & paying for the shipping fees of a book that inadvertently sent. It is sad to me that I had an order of about $130-$150 & was planning on making this a monthly thing as I am a serious Paleo order but I will NEVER order from this store again.

oh & their bread sucks. I didn't order it online but they do sell it at my local Whole Foods & it is the most bland bread I have ever tasted in my life.<//Review>

<Review>My husband & I have been loyal customers of Julian Bakery for years. We've purchased the one carb bread and the two carb bread for years at our local store. I've also told so many people about it.  It tasted like homemade bread and made excellent toast!  I bought many loaves at $8.99 a loaf.  I didn't even mind paying it because it was worth it.  We are very saddened to hear about the death of that recipe.  I purchased 2 loaves of the new stuff and thought it must have been a bad batch.  It was horrible!  After trying 2 slices, in the trash it went.  I tried it again a month later and threw it away too. It tasted like stale rye bread. The middle of the toasted bread is  mushy like french toast.  Julian's bread went from EXCELLENT to  NOT EDIBLE. Why would they do that? They said they will change their recipe again in February.  Next time, I'll rely on reviews before I waste my money.  In the meantime, I'll search for another low carb product or recipe.<//Review>< Name>

<Text>You HAD a perfectly wonderful low carb bread! I was a regular customer of yours. I had faithfully purchased #1 and #2 for years and years. Toasted, there was none better!! It was an important part of my diet, especially due to the fiber content.

Now all that you sell for almost $8/loaf is a tasteless mess not worth the money. My local store that sells your product is as upset as I am. You used to have an entire door in his refrigerated area donated to your product. Now he's reduced it to half, and it's on the bottom. On the top is a NEW product line from one of your competitors, but it's no better than your "new" #1 and #2! UGH! It's like eating a sponge, dull and tasteless with an ugly texture and mouth feel. And watch out for that aftertaste!

I tried toasting it, trying to give it a fair trial, added almond butter, butter, and nice Smucker's Sugar Free...a total disaster! Then I tried my old recipe of simply frying the formerly delicious Cinnamon Raisin in butter and topping with Joseph's SF Maple Syrup, and what was once a fabulous breakfast treat was now thrown in the garbage!! I DO NOT throw $8/loaf bread into the garbage, but this was not worth saving or eating! Icky!

The owner of the health food store sadly tells me you are "being stubborn" in not allowing us your once fabulous bread. You could simply do what Coke did when they made the same mistake with their product, hence Coke Classic was brought back for those who preferred it. I do not understand your enthusiasm for this newest product of yours. It is horrible! I know I would like to have the old product back at least as an *option* for those of us who just can't stand your new product. I'm sure we are in numbers of legion proportions, as was voiced by my health food store owner. He's lost a lot of business over this, and I hope you do, too.

Think of the profits you are throwing away. I sincerely hope you will reconsider, and allow the preferences of your customers to be heard and acted on. If you do, I'll be a happy customer again. I'll pay the high price for delicious, *high fiber*, low carb bread, but if you are unwilling to make it again, I just can't throw my money away.

What on earth was your wife and those 100 customers eating? It couldn't have been this awful excuse for "bread"! Perhaps they just don't want to hurt your feelings with the truth!</Text></record>

<Text>I've been trying to eat low carb for several years, and eating your bread (regular, sourdough, cinnamon) for most of that time. I've enjoyed it, being reminded of the texture and flavor of my mom's homemade bread. Frankly, having this bread has mad my low carb diet much more palatable.

Last week I bought a couple of loaves at my local Whole Foods. I only found your new SmartCarb #1 bread rather than the original version, but I'm always willing to try something different. Frankly, the bread had the taste and texture of a kitchen sponge, with light rye overtones. Horrible. I thought maybe it was because I had toasted it (although the old version actually was even better toasted), so I tried it with a sandwich. I've never spend so much time chewing bread before. Horrible as well. I'm returning the product and you've lost a customer.
=============
Interesting. I sent the above post to Julian Bakery before seeing the comments here. But I figured I should add my comments to the others that don't like the "new improved" recipe. Then I looked a little closer at the owner comments. Extremely defensive and disappointing. You shouldn't expect everyone to like everything you do, but if you're going to stay in business sometimes you just have to admit sometimes you get things wrong. It doesn't matter whether the sample size was 100 or 100,000, especially if the sample is picked badly or you don't do A-B comparisons. Personally, I think this is one of those times. Don't compound your mistakes. We wouldn't be giving you feedback unless we actually wanted you to succeed.< /Text>< pics>

Julian Bakery has recently "improved" these two breads.  THEY ARE NOT IMPROVED!

Do NOT buy this new improved bread!   It is terrible and has the consistency of a sponge with ZERO flavor.  It is completely inedible unless toasted and even toasted it's chewy.

Julian Bakery refuses to reply to complaints and blocks anyone who posts a complaint about the new formula on their Facebook page.

< Review>
I've been eating Julian Bakery's Samart Carb ! and 2 breads for the last 3 years, and have loved them, and recommended them to friends. They recently changed the recipes for those breads and now they're absolutely horrible--tasteless, tough and chewy, like some kind of foam rubber. On top of that, they now have triple the carbs, and none of the fiber, and only get worse in the freezer. I loved having a great-tasting bread with lots of fiber in in it. And I was able to lose almost 25 lbs. eating their bread. But now I have to find something different--this stuff is practically inedible. And my friends who also used to eat it agree completely. By the the way, the Zero Carb bread is even worse. But don't trust me--go ahead and buy a loaf and you'll find out.

Also, it looks like Julian is now so successful that it takes forever to get the bread. It used to arrive in a few days on the West Coast. Now it sometimes takes 2 weeks.<//Review>

Cannot write a positive review on their products because it's been 3 weeks since I ordered and paid for my bread and I have not received my order.  I received an email with a tracking # on 7/16 and 6 days later, the product still has not been delivered to UPS for delivery.

Will not order again from them.

Update: When I did finally get my order today (nearly 4 weeks later), UPS or FEDX who ever delivered it (box had both stickers on it) -- left it at my office BACK door outside in 90 degree heat on the SOUTH side of the building.  It wasn't discovered until after 5pm by a neighbor who messaged me.  My order clearly stated FRONT door even though you did not put it on the shipping label.

The coconut bread is wet, sticky, slimey and in my opinion totally unedible.  The low carb bread was smashed and sweating so now the outside is wet in spots.  Both of them were extremely hot from sitting outside.  I have refrigerated both of them at this point but I'm so mad about the whole ordeal, I'm afraid I would choke on them if I tried to eat them.< /Review>

<review>I ordered the low carb bread in three varieties... absolutely awful!!  It took 3 weeks for delivery and then was so disappointed in the product.  No matter how I doctored up the bread, it was inedible.  After trying to get my money back, the owner told me that they don't refund on "perishable items."  When I told him, it was inedible, he said they get calls all the time from customers wanting their money back on the low carb bread, but they never give it.... against policy.  Don't fall for the testimonials on the website re: low carb bread.  I can't speak for the rest of the breads, but the low carb was a total rip off... literally went straight to the trash.  Awful!!!< /review>< Pictures>

If I had done this review a few months ago it would have been excellent across the board.  However, they changed the recipe in my favorite Smart Carb breads to something... well.. inedible, even toasted.  In reading past reviews I see that the owner changed the formula to better serve diabetics.   I think that adding a 'Diabetic Friendly' version of the new formula (like the Gluten Free Option) and still serve the old formula as the Smart Carb version.  I only have about 3/4 loaf left from my frozen stash of the original version and am not looking forward to hunting down new brands.

I hope the Amazing Sourdough hasn't changed, it's my last resort with my transition order.

Response to the owner:  While you and 100 other select people may like the new bread, it is obvious many of your customers don't.  Perhaps it's time to be a bit less defensive and a bit more focused on customer service.  I mean, really, claiming that a customer review is fake simply because it disagrees with your personal taste?  tsk tsk

Interesting, the owner's response magically disappeared after I wrote that.  I've also noticed that all of the negative reviews on their own site have done a magic poof-gone as well.</Text>

That sums it up. They carry overly priced items, which when shipped, get covered with mold and you still have to pay for them (even they go straight to the garbage can). When you call to complain, nobody is available to solve it for you. I learned my lesson the hard way. NEVER AGAIN I'm ordering from this unkind, money-greedy and hoodwinking bakery.

I ordered the coconut and almond bread (covered in mold), the coconute macaroons, mustang bars, paleo wraps, almond thins and the goji berries. The only rockstar item I think they carry is the mustang bars. They were really good.

Overall, this place is a joke. Stay away!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Well, I seem to be part or the majority here... I placed my order on 8/1 and after many emails and promises, i now have a tracking number showing it to arrive on the 22nd.  now after reading about mold i am even more worried.. I live in theATL where it is hot.. i had to pay 2 day air shipping to ensure quality... I want to like this bread because this is the first one without Yeast.  I have to eat yeast free foods.. i have been dreaming of a sandwich since the 1st of August!
In a way i hope i dont like it so i wont have to go through this again.. :(

I paid for my 2 loaves of bread on 8/14.   As of 9/13, haven't received the breads I orderd.  I called the company 2 days ago and claimed that the order is with OnTrac courier. So I called to follow-up this morning, I was given a tracking # and Joe, who answered the call said that the breads are now being processed with OnTrac.  I checked with OnTrac and found out that the tracking # has been created on Sept. 5.  How would a tracking # help if the breads have not been shipped?!?!?  Very poor service on your part Julian's Bakery.  You have my money as well, FULLY PAID.  I can't come back to purchase your bread nor recommend your services to others.< /review>

<date>1383390251215< /date><Rating>1</Rating><Text>I ordered the low carb bread as well as 2 boxes of low carb almond crackers.   I get it that the wait time was longer than expected.  I live in Tennessee and the items were supposedly "fresh" baked and then delivered from their bakery in CA.   I was willing to wait for some much desired low carb food.   Finally got it after 3 weeks.  BLLEEEEECHHHHHH,  OMG I have never tasted such a disgusting product.  The "bread" was shaped like a loaf and that's where the similarities ended.  It was so vile that my mouth instantly spit it out.  There was no chewing, pondering, thinking well maybe.......Nope.  absolutely disgusting in flavor, smell, texture.  Not even sure you can call it bread.  The crackers also were horrible.  Tasted like moldy cardboard.  Felt like cardboard. Smelled like cardboard.   Has anyone at this bakery tasted this crap????   How on earth can they let this get shipped out??  Threw everything in garbage.  What a waste of time and $37.    Julian Bakery and Low Carb?  What a sham.

I actually give this ZERO stars!!!
I wish I would of seen these comments before I bought this "bread". I bought the no carb and no carb cinnamon bread because I read all the comments on their site saying it was really good. I shouldnt have been fooled. OF COURSE they are going to put only the good ones! I just posted a comment on their page but it said it will be reviewed so I KNOW it will not be posted.

Anyways, it was my first time ever buying this bread. Since I am new to a low carb diet, I thought this would be perfect. I just got my breads TODAY and it arrived with MOLD!!!!! I paid for MOLDY BREAD!!! WTF!?! I was really angry and threw it away. I am not even going to touch it!!!! And now reading all these comments, I see that they wont even refund people. I wrote them an email after it happened (since they were already closed) so we will see what they say but I am not holding my breath

So lesson learned... DO NOT BUY FROM THIS AWEFUL COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!

Update: They really do delete your comments and block you on Facebook. Very unprofessional. Still waiting on a reply for a refund but I am not holding my breath.< /review>

I looked up a local store on their website to purchase it and every time I went to this store, they told me they were out of the bread.  I finally asked after about a month and the person told me that they are no longer going to carry this bread because of all the problems they have had with Julian Bakery.  He told me at first they had all kinds of excuses as to why they didn't ship out their orders and then the bakery just quit answering their phones or returning calls. That should have been clue #1 for me about this company.

Then I saw another facebook ad so I left a comment about the situation and asked "why are you advertising if you can't even return phone calls or deliver your bread to my store locally? I would prefer to not have to pay for shipping so can you please get in touch with my store, etc.."  They immediately deleted my comment.

But still I was on the quest for this supposedly wonderful paleo bread and was going to place a large order but as I typed in Julian Bakery into Google to go to their website, I see their rating as a 7/30.  Reading all the comments here, it sounds like the same experience everyone has had, not to mention the $8/per loaf bread apparently tastes horrible.  So thankfully, I have not wasted my money.  It did seem too good to be true to have a gluten free, low carb, yeast free product that tastes good.  Most of the customers here say their bread arrived moldy or not at all and those who received it fresh said it was inedible. So glad I did not just waste $50 on this product and put money into the pockets of a company that has such horrible customer service!! Deleting negative comments and only posting positive comments shows a huge lack of integrity on the part of the owners.  Don't waste your money!< /review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

You changed because of only 10% of the diabetics...Why cant you offer both formulas.

Old Carb1 and  New Carb 1...

Was there a lawsuit against you?   Was the action from the FDA?

What happen you had a great product with CARB 1 bread and you screwed it by reformulating it. It now is like chewing rubber and it tastes bad. Bring back the old bread or you lost me as a customer who would travel 80 miles to pickup bread at your store or pay the steep price for the bread at Whole Foods or Mothers Market,

WHO was the idiot that decided they needed to change the formula for the bread.,

Must be related to the moron who changed the formula for COKE several years ago and then COKE figured out they screwed up and return to the original formula.,<//Text>

Julian Bakery's has a wide selection of gluten-free and low-carb bread and bakery items. I have celiac disease (gluten intolerance) and my husband has type 1 diabetes (requires low-carb diet) so these products are perfect for us. I was so excited about all the gluten free treats that I bought 2 of every muffin or goody that they had in the store. Unfortunately not much tasted very good. I understand that most of the things I got were basically sugar free, but still, some were just terrible. Some were tolerable. The no-carb bread isn't very good, but if you need a no-carb option for sandwiches it will do. I've had really, really good gluten free bakery items before as well as low-carb bread, so I know it's possible to do in a tasty fashion! I think they need to change their recipes - or from what I've read in other reviews, go back to old recipes. It's cool to see a place trying to make a dent in this very open market, but unfortunately they aren't succeeding.</Text>

<Review>Used to LOVE them. In the past 5 years, I have probably bought a thousand dollars worth of their low-carb bread. I would buy 9 loaves at a time and then we would freeze it. Then about 3 months ago, they changed their recipe, WITHOUT WARNING. And the new recipe is horrible, basically inedible, even the ducks won't eat it. (This was after waiting almost a month to get the order which was supposed to arrive in 2 weeks.)

I contacted them 4 times to complain, and asked for my money back. No response. After 3 months, they finally did respond and said (this is their verbatim response): "We apologize for the inconvenience unfortunately we don't issue any refunds or replacement on perishables, as for our Products we are very proud to be able to offer nutritional bread to customers who could not eat any bread at all, plaease understand that vcwe specialize in low carb, glutten free, high protein, organic bread so each and every one of our products will have a different taste / texture, this is why we advise our customers to please get informed befire they make their purchase not only because we know our products are priced higher that other but also because they might have a different affect on different people."  (So in addition to horrible bread & terrible customer service, the person responding to complaints is illiterate.)

Well, I thought I "knew" what I was getting, or I would not have bought 9 loves of this awful bread. I'm pretty upset that I spent $70 for something that is inedible and they refuse to refund my money, or to even respond to my complaints without my badgering them.

I left a few negative comments on their Facebook page, but they kept deleting them, and finally blocked me from posting. I saw they did the same to a few other negative posts, because they would be gone whenever I went back.  I guess they only want suck-up compliments, not honest appraisal.  Talk about burying your head in the sand.  I hope they go out of business, because they certainly deserve to.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I think I know why Julian Bakery changed their recipe for SmartCarb bread and is so defensive about changing it back.  If diabetics were having glucose problems with it, that probably means it wasn't as low carb as they said it was.  It tasted (old recipe) way too good.  I'm really disappointed.  I've tried their SmartCarb 1&2, Carb Zero and both Paleo breads, and the SmartCarb breads were wonderful.  Too good to be true? I was thrilled to find them, but the others were basically inedible.  There was nothing bread-like about them except maybe the shape. Still, I was able to eat the SmartCarb bread without going into a carb feeding frenzy, so it worked for me.  I'm thinking they don't want to have to bring it back with a more accurate nutrition label, because that would make them look bad, but I'd be happy to buy it if they did because it is the only bread I've eaten in the last several years that didn't derail my diet. By they way, I ordered 6 loaves to be shipped last November (local store stopped carrying them). Still no bread, but they charged my credit card the day I ordered.<//review>

The previous ingredient and texture on the carb smart bread and cinnamon rasien bread was good and lower in carbs. The NEW INGREDIANT IS DISGUSTING AND CHEWY AND HAS DOUBLE THE CARBS! Please change back to the old ingredient or offer both!!!! Bought from local store at Goodwin's.< /Review>

<name>Dave Giddings< /name><response>None<//response><text>When you are reading reviews of the low carb breads Julian Bakery sells, be sure you are reading the most recent ones.  I used to like their Smart Carb #1 & #2 breads, but the new formula is totally inedible.  The defensive responses from management insisting that everyone else likes it, so you should too, are offensive to say the least.  This a blatant lie. I understand that everyone doesn't like the same thing, but I honestly don't see how anyone can like this stuff let alone bite through it.  I literally could not bite through the crust part of the slice and the inside was so rubbery I ended up spitting it out.  And yes, I toasted it as the owner seems to think it is the best way to eat it.  Trust me, it doesn't help.  Two loaves went directly into the trash can.  And don't even THINK about buying the Paleo breads!  OMG, what were they thinking???  Just because you CAN make something, doesn't mean you SHOULD.  It is sliced about the thickness of a cracker and has the taste and texture of a piece of cardboard...and comparing it to cardboard is an insult to the cardboard!  Really, don't buy this product until they change the formula yet again.  I know I won't.  Too bad because it used to be OK.  Their light sourdough bread and the breakfast bread is still pretty good and lower in carbs than regular breads, but it will take at least three weeks to get it, if you're lucky.  I live in the same county as the bakery and it still takes forever to get it.  At least I haven't received any moldy loaves...yet.  By the way, my complaint directly to the company's email address (that the owner keeps telling everyone they should have contacted) was ignored.  They might be rolling in the dough at the moment (so to speak), but once everyone gets their first order, this company will disappear unless there is a big attitude adjustment on the part of the owner and another new "improved" recipe.  I'm all for helping out small business, but not when they put on this holier-than-thou attitude.  Just bite the bullet, admit you made a mistake, and get on with the job of winning back your customers.  And, for God's sake, stop selling this new bread!!!</text></record></dataset><record>

<GmapID>0x80dc022acdd63a2b:0xcb4c54a4a067cf40</GmapID><Text>Lets see - ordered 7/1 received moldy bread on 7/27. a few emails later a replacement order was shipped and arrived 8/6 again with mold. 2 calls , 2 emails, no response

My advice , Julian bakery , don't advertise on the web and ship around the country if you cant handle the load
mold can happen , poor customer service has no excuse

UPDATE- 8/17  received my non-moldy loaves today -

They need to update the label - right next to grain FREE and gluten FREE.. they need to add TASTE and ENJOYMENT free - bleechhhhh this is the most horrid thing I have ever eaten. couldnt stand it fresh , barely edible toasted ( for 7 minutes and it didnt even brown)

The best way  I can describe this stuff is if you coated a soggy magazine with rubber and sliced it to look like bread -you'd have paleo almond "bread"

Thankfully I do not NEED to eat something like this , but as a vegetarian and diabetic it sounded like a good idea and I really wanted it to be good

When their abominable "customer circus" finally emailed me back they said they "updated the recipe" - i hope this is isnt better than it was , because I feel sorry for those that have to eat gluten free</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I would LOVE to try this bread..... (please note I had to rate them in order to leave a review although I haven't even gotten to try the actual product yet)

I am only aware that they exist because of their advertisements on Facebook.  I did check to see where the bread is sold locally and found one place in our town of Fort Collins CO at the Vitamin Cottage. I called VC to check and see if they had any in stock before driving over and NO they did not.  Not really a big deal since many popular products sell out prior to restock.  BUT, I  was told there are issues with this company getting the bread to the store so it is rarely in stock.  As a consumer this is frustrating and honestly I don't care WHY there is no bread there..... If you are advertising on FB (of all places), that you sell the Paleo Bread in local stores then please be responsible enough to actually have it available to the public you are advertising to.  I called the local number for the Bakery as well and it was a recording.   I do not want to order bread online since it is suppose to be at VC and also because of the poor reviews given.  (If I remember right in the last posters review it took the company a month to respond.  Holy cow.)    Come on JB...hire more help or stop trying to grow right now!< /Review>< Pictures>

They should have a grade below poor for this.
I was searching Low carb bread online, and came across this company with wonderful reviews (on their site of course) and decided to give it a try.  They had so many different kinds of bread that i figured i'd try 6 kinds to get the shipping discount.  We only managed to try 3.  The rest are still in the freezer awaiting the trash bin.  They are not edible.  We've had Natural Ovens brand (still good) and the local store carries some brand called Healthy living?, also good.
The 3 we tried to eat were, the coconut paleo, the smart carb, and the smart carb cinnamon raisin.   We tried toasting heavy (like they suggest),  We could not find a way to make this bread good.  I would try a bite and have to spit it out.  It's just awful.  I can't bring myself to even try the others.  I can't believe I paid so much for utter garbage.  And waited over a month to have it shipped.   The zero carb cookies, too , just bad.  Dry and nearly tasteless.   Being on a low carb diet doesn't mean we have to eat crap.   I will be re-ordering Natural Ovens and trying to forget this bad experience.<//review>

<Review>I first purchased Carb 1 and Carb 2 over a year ago at a local store. Loved the quality, texture, and taste of the bread. Decided to go to there website to see what else they had to offer, where I order more of the above and the amazing sourdough. I recieved the order that week, very prompt. I have over the year gravitated to amazing sourdough and the Carb 2. Just this week bought at the store Carb 2 which I noticed was labeled new formula, tried it this morning, had to spit it out it was so bad. WHY CHANGE A GREAT THING. PLEASE MAKE THE OLD RECIPE. DON'T BUY IF IT SAYS NEW FORMULA YOU WILL BE SORRY.
Also ordered some for my mother before I realised the change, the order took a long time to get to her which was surprising, she said it tasted very spongey, I thought she was being pickey, I owe her an apology. BEWARE< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I ordered the Smart Carb#2 bread before they said that they were going to revamp the recipe...5 weeks later (not 7-14 business days)  I recieved the new bread! $80 dollars of very bad old sponge tasting bread. They are not offering to refund my money...they said I could order any of their bread for a dollar a loaf...there is not a  bread that they make that offers the same health benefits as the original Smart Carb#2. I have seen many others that are unhappy, why not keep them both if your wife likes the new one because it seems like more people don't like it than do.<//Text>

SCAMMERS!!!!!   BREAD ARRIVED MOLDY, WEEKS AFTER IT WAS SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE.  They had given me several different dates (in separate e-mails) as to when it was supposed to have shipped. After that, it was radio-silence from them. Had to escalate my claim on Paypal, only to find out today that they did NOT find in my favor!!  Unbelievable.</text>

< Review>
My experience was terrible. Not only did it take a MONTH to get my order delivered, when I got the Paleo Macaroon's they were full of mold! It was utterly disgusting. I could have dealt with the order being delayed but moldy food is unacceptable!<//Review>

Nestled at the very top of Yucaipa on Oak Glen Road is one of the most all inspiring, beautiful camps I've ever had the pleasure of visiting. The facilities and cabins and staff at Pilgrim Pines are all above and beyond expectations.< /text>

There's a new Site Director there since January 2018 and she is awesome! The place is super clean and the food service has been great too. If you want to check it out, GO TAKE A TOUR...you will see for yourself how nice it is.</Text>

Food isn’t good I got extremely sick that I was rushed to the hospital. This was when tofur or whatever ran the camp. Liked that they were LGBT friendly but I got ill and didn’t like the man who ran it I didn’t like his attitude.  Always great staff so kind.</text>

<Text>We were there for a church retreat. So, it wasn't for the creature comforts that one would look for in a hotel type setting. The people running it are hard workers and they made our stay there quite pleasant.< /Text>< GmapID>

<rating>1< /rating><text>My child attended this camp for his high school event on August 18th thru August 20th 2016. He says there were  multiple mice in the cabin running around. The males showers were dirty and no lights worked in the shower area. The female cabin had bed bugs, so the females had to be relocated to a different cabin. I will not send my child to this camp for any future events.  I would not recommend this place and I will be calling code enforcement this coming business day.< /text>< Name>

< Review>
Great office and service. I would probably have more time with them but the office is on the second floor facing Francisquito st.
But an agent there, Richard makes you forget about where the office is located and makes this place feel like a piece of home.
One GREAT thing is that he will tell you how it is. And I personally like that. He's not trying to "sell" me, he is genuinely helping me down to the last cent. It almost seems that Richard is the owner and not an agent. I hope he is. He stands out.</Review>

Hello there first of all I'd like to say "All State is the Best!!!" Secondly, I don't know how I didnt quote with them earlier I'm saving over $399.00 a year with them. Thanks to the whole team for making it happen for me especially to Raziel, Adriana and Mike for helping me find the right and adequate quote for me. Don't quote with anyone else until you've quoted with All State. Their prices are super economic and the service is insanely good and helpful. Thanks again All Sate!!!!!< /Text>

Adriana went above and beyond with her service. We told her we needed coverage for our car and she kindly gave us many options to choose from. She was extremely knowledgeable and made sure we were as protected as can be! Not knowing much about insurance policies, Adriana was patient with me and made sure I understood everything before I made a decision. I highly recommend her! :)<//Text>

Adriana is my go to person, although I have worked with her other counter parts such as Jacky. I was unaware of the importance of auto insurance coverage until Adriana gave me a detail comparison of what I was paying for with 21st century and what I should be getting. Switching over was a no-brainer. If I have any questions or issue I do not hesitate to contact Adriana and she always come through. Call them if you want a quote and ask all your what if questions. They're very helpful.< /text>

<review>After having State Farm for 19 years I switched over. Never had I known what exact coverage I had until I was explained thoroughly. I was paying so much for such little coverage.  Gloria helped me out and got me great coverage and great price. Better prices than State Farm. With what I was paying at State Farm I got Auto, Renters and Life Ins. Mike the Life specialist is amazing!! Extremely happy with this office.</review></record></dataset><record>

Adriana Trujillo is the best. She did a job of explaining how signing up with Allstate would save me money on my auto insurance. Not only did she get me better coverage, she got me better rate as well. Also, she well knowledge of the benefits are of  signing up with Allstate, and I felt as if she really cared about my well-being, which is appreciate. I recommend getting your inssurance through her.< /text>

I recently switched my insurance to All state and I can’t believe how uneducated I was in my previous coverage. Juan Castaneda was the agent that helped me and educated me with my insurance needs. I own a home and cars, and I finally have a peace of mind knowing I am fully covered .Juan was very polite  and very informative and I am glad to have my policy with All state.</Text>

< Review>
I got impressed with the facilities of this office they got a room for each agent that was a “plus” for me because I asked all the concerns I got of the policy and the rates. Differently from other insurances where you can hear other people talking, and you don’t get that privacy to speak and ask about rates and type of coverage no to mention that the agent Alejandra was very attended to my concerns and demonstrate good knowledge. Also, they respect the rates and quotes they offer. On the contrary, to others places where they told me an amount, but when you got your first bill, it is different. Not to mention that when I got an accident under the coverage in one of my old insurances, they refuse to use original parts and slow the repairs of my vehicle that cost me extra money in the rental car. For this reason, it worth to have better insurance and one may think Allstate it is more expensive but not really. I got a good rate, coverage and the peace of mind that offer Allstate as they said in the commercial “You are in a good hand.” If I comparate with my experience with the others insurances. I prefer to pay few extra bucks but have a good insurance that will meet all my expectations.  Overall, they got great installations, reasonable rates, excellent customer services, and attractive and very charming stuff.
I got the chance to meet Juan this guy it is honest to the hearth and do wherever for their customer.

I highly recommend this places to all my friends and family.

My favorite restaurant in Pasadena! I've had pretty much everything on the menu and its all amazing. Some favs are the duck, the brie, and the porkchop (usually a special). The wine list is great and the staff are also excellent at giving suggestions.</Text>

Entre Nous....makes you feel that you are in La Cité de la Lumière. Great French Bistro cuisine of high quality & notable competence.

Sidewalk & patio dining  during the Pandemic adds to the ambience of being in the Quatrième Arrondissement or the Rive Gauche, etc.

Warm, discreet, "bon accueil" reception by the staff, and Laurent is cool for his friendly nonchalance.

With the demise of Patina with its formal yet relaxed friendly, thoughtful staff, Entre Nous/Between Us is now my favorite restaurant Français par excellence in the L.A. area.< /text>

My wife and I went out for a walk a week ago, checking out the various outdoor dining options around Old Town Pasadena for our anniversary dinner in a few days. After checking out the hustle and bustle of Colorado, we skipped down to Green and as soon as we turned the corner and walked through, we saw this place and immediately smelled the delicious aromas coming from the kitchen. Done!

We sent an email requesting a reservation for Wednesday evening at 630 pm, and arrived 15 minutes early. Being a weeknight, it wasn't terribly busy but a couple other groups showed up within 15 minutes of us being seated as well.

The smells that intrigued us a few days ago had not led us astray - this place was great! The owners and wait staff were very attentive, courteous, and fun. They kept our bread basket full, our souls warm with good cheer, and bellies happily full with the food we ordered. We were particularly smitten with the brie en croute appetizer - warm brie cheese in a puff pastry and savory sauce. Yum!

My wife also thoroughly enjoyed her roast chicken (and what a mound of fries that came with!), while I ordered their pork chop special they had that evening. All so so good. We will definitely be back here again soon!<//Review>

Great French restaurant and a huge improvement compared to the previous restaurant that was here. They had around 5-6 waiters on duty during Saturday evening. Started with the escargo as an appetizer which went well with the bread. Ordered the rack of lambs which was presliced for you. Go for medium-rare. For dessert, the blanched pear dessert was unique and was complemented with vanilla ice cream. Good lively atmosphere. Enjoy!<//text>

<text>Came here for mother's day for brunch.  I will have to come back again to try their escargot since it is on the dinner menu and so we weren't able to order it for brunch.  The chicken dish I had (poulet rotisserie)  was so tender and juicy.   I had the pommes frites with it and it had a subtle taste of garlic.  The pain perdu was very good.</text>< Pics>

My husband and I came here for our wedding anniversary and I have been trying to find a reason to come here since opening. Having a French Bistro restaurant in the Pasadena neighborhood is definitely a plus (we were getting bored of the same type of cuisines). The location is really cute and all I could think about is their dessert.

We had the seafood bouillabaisse and lamb rack. Both were cook perfectly with the right level of seasoning. I am no expert in French food but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We also the escargots as an appetizer. The pear dessert though...... gosh, it’s AMAZINGLY good. I watch a lot of cooking shows and have seen people doing it but tasting it for the first time blown my mind away. The pear dessert is unique to this place in Pasadena and I would recommend skipping all the other dessert and get this. Unless I have been living under the rock (which is partially true), the chocolate pot, cream brûlée, apple tartine, and creme anglaise are desserts you can get it everywhere else. So get adventurous and get the pear.

The service are also very intimate. The servers are very attentive and the owners were out here speaking to us as well.

Wrapping this up; we lived in Pasadena for quite some time and I am so glad this place opened up. Welcome to the neighborhood! Keep up the good work! We are looking forward to many many delicious French food to come.<//Review>

Establishment is unprofessional. My puppy accidently peed in the middle of the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. I politely asked for napkins to clean it up when I was verbally attacked by an employee for what had happened. I am embarrassed for him by the way he treated me in front of the entire restaurant. He refused to let me clean it up and went screaming back into the place. I never leave reviews but I am compelled in this situation because of how unnecessarily aggressive and unfairly I was treated for a small accident by a puppy on a public sidewalk. I went from suggesting to my friends we try this restaurant to all the of us agreeing to never giving them any business.<//text>

<review>COVID REVIEW: We've dined in and ordered out with Entre Nous since COVID restaurant restrictions were lifted - each time has resulted in fabulous, attentive, and safe experiences.

FOOD
Per usual, each dish is phenomenal. Try the Tahiti-style mussels! Buttery, garlicy escargots are truly decadent. My favorite is the sea bass over lentils. I love how Entre Nous stays true to their French style without being overly complicated; they use simple ingredients and transform them into luxurious dishes that leave you more than satisfied.

AMBIANCE
Last night, we were able to experience Entre Nous' patio dining experience. They have loads of seating under the lovely trees alongside Green Street. Tables offer the same intimate experience of dining by candlelight while experiencing all the safety protocols during this pandemic. This is the best al fresco dining experience in Old Town Pasadena.

STAFF
Consistently friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and energetic. You won't find distracted or uncaring personnel here...  As with many small businesses bending with the hurdles of this crisis, all of the staff of Entre Nous are stoic, professional, and manage the stresses I'm sure they're all experiencing. You're truly treated like old friends when you visit!

Please visit Entre Nous!< /review><time>1598209975154</time><rating>5</rating>< pictures>

<review>They are the best! Very friendly people and best Filet Mignon au Bleu d’Auvergne ever! Its been 10 years that we know them. We were going to cafe beaujolais  when they owned that place and now we come to Entre Nous since they opened. We cant wait for the situation to get back to normal and go to Entre Nous and have their delicious Escargots de Bourgogne, Filet Mignon au Bleu d’Auvergne and creme brulee  of course with nice bottle of wine! also to have a bit of friendly chat with them, miss you guys! :)<//review>< date>

The cheese platter was just ok. The soft cheese were served right out of the refrigerator, which is a huge mistake if you know anything about cheeses. We spent most of meal waiting for the cheese to get to room temperature. The entrees were both good but not excellent, as was the wine selection. I think we will give them another shot in a few weeks and see if things have improved.</Text>

<text>Emergency entrance staff needs work on their patient  care skills , my little boy couldn’t walk which is why I brought him in he woke up like that an when I asked for a wheel chair getting off the car she turned an said well how does he walk at home ? As if to say he didn’t need one ,  Instead of just getting me a wheelchair he ended up staying in hospital an as  I am writing this he is still here unable to walk  6 days later .<//text>< time>

Horrible, took them 3 days to do the gallbladder surgery my girlfriend needed that they said needed to be done in 24 hours. Some of the nurses were rude when I had questions other where nice and answered my questions. Go to literally any other hospital.< /Review>

<Review>My brother was admitted for some tests and has difficulty tolerating the procedures.  Everyone involved has been pleasant, helpful and informative.  They have kept me updated every step of the way.  Thank you to all of the doctors and nurses that are treating my brother and keeping him well cared for.< /Review><Date>1560972687389<//Date><name>Nick DeFord</name><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_id>

This hospital is getting worse and worse. Nurses are rude and don't care for the patients. Sad part is nobody takes action against this hospital or nurses or the doctors of this hospital.< /text>

<Text>I was admitted May 2020. Due to my condition, I was highly susceptible to infections. The people in charge put me in a room with a dirty, nasty, sticky, smelly homeless person, who stunk so bad, they told him they had to throw all of his clothing in the trash..  I had to demand to be put in a different room.   So much for the education levels of those in charge!!!< /Text>< Rate>

<Text>My son was taken by ambulance to this hospital after sustaining an injury at a football game. He broke his leg in 2 places and even though this place was a total mad house, every single member of staff was awesome. Very helpful, attentive and kind. I have a HUGE respect for these men and women. They were able to manipulate and set my son's leg without surgery. They even took multiple x-rays after putting on his cast to insure everything was in place. We were very pleased considering the terrible circumstances.</Text><gmapID>0x80945e1c1c846525:0x172efa30c95192e1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Some of the staff are pretty rude and will treat you like you have done something wrong. On the other hand, some of the nurses and doctors are very pleasant.</Text>

Terrible experience. They were not concerned in finding out what was wrong with my daughter. They had gerneys lined up and down the halls. The nurses were rude and treated us like we were criminals. They wouldn't let a lady in, that was there with her 93 year old mother. They told her they were on lock down, but they let me through. Sounded like an old woman was not being treated gently. She would scream out in pain. Had thoughts of it being the 93 year old woman that they wouldn't let her daughter through. They treated my daughter like there wasn't anything wrong with her, but revoked her license anyways. They insisted she tell them what nationality she was. Very strange environment. I see why people insist on dieing at home. I will never visit that hospital again and will encourage other people to stay away from this hospital. Didn't seem like a very caring group. I feel bad for the ones that really care, because the attitude of the others will surely taint any good reputation.< /Text>

I was in a motorcycle accident.  Lots off broken bones. Was In icu for 8 days. Then two other step down rooms. My experience was nothing short of teriffic.  The staff was great.  The doctors were nice also. Both kept me informed and,  discussed my treatments. Food was also great. The only complaint I have is the beds. Icu beds were great. All others to short. And uncomfortable. But, my overall experience was great.< /text>

The E.R. Dr. M was rude and condescending.  The E.R. nurses were foul, rude, and had poor bedside manner. I believe they broke H.I.P.P.A. law because nurses that weren't assigned to me kept asking why I was there and then would  leave. Then there is a female transporter, I believe her name is Kady (??) She came to transfer me to Radiology. I mentioned to her that the resident E.R. Dr did not want me to leave my room because my health was unstable.  She immediately became  irritate and stated that I was refusing treatment  in a condescending tone. I politely told her, trying to catch my breath, that I wasn't,  just following Dr.s orders. She ripped off her gloves at once then stormed out of the room. She told my nurse that I refused and left the unit. My nurse and I were completely shocked and confused. Totally unacceptable and unprofessional!  I was transferred to 4 East (Tele unit).  The majority of my nurses needed customer service courses. I had a safety incident that occurred and reported it to two supervisors.  It was handled poorly and was not resolved during my stay. I witnessed nurses walking around with gloves on in the hallways. A nurse who came into my room with gloves on after helping another patient. I witnessed an E.R. nurse leave a full vial of Fentanyl in my room and then return to it 15 minutes later. I have had multiple hospitalizations at different facilities and this is by far the worst and disappointing as far as professionalism and integrity goes. Come on CRMC, GET IT TOGETHER! Your employee moral is in dire need!< /review>

<Text>This hospital is horrible! Doctors can't even give simple answers. Probably OVERBOOK my mom's appointment to make their books/schedule seems like they're actually doing ANY work! My mom spent a whole week just to have the doctor and their "specialist" doctor say the same thing that they said, the LAST time my mom got brought it, to the emergency room, and got admitted for another few days. Garbage work!</Text>< pics>

<text>This was several years ago.
I cut the tendon on my left forefinger at work. Got the Emergency Room at 6pm, ...got to see the doctor at 12:30am. The only reason I went to this hospital was they hand a hand surgeon on duty, ...as I was told.
The ER doc "Sal" said it was too expensive to send me upstairs to the hand surgeon and that 'she' would have to do the surgery.
"Too expensive" this was a on-the-job workman's comp injury.
I was afraid that too much time was passing to get the tendons reattached correctly, so I consented.
The nurse-guy ask me 3 or 4 for times and the doc asked me 1 to 2 times that: "You're right handed... right," as if to give them permission to work on my left hand.
I told them all "I may be right handed, but my left hand is my money hand." "The only thing the right does is hold a drill, the left manipulates my products." I was pretty fast at setting up product with the left.
The first thing she said when she finished was "I think I did it right?" So it became apparent she didn't send me up to the hand sergeon in was because she wanted experience to build up her resume. Leaving me with a half functional finger.
I never regained my productivity at work and l lost interest in rock climbing after the botched surgery by a amateur.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>This was my favorite experience at a hair salon! Amy was really great about listening to what I said I wanted (even though I was being really indecisive) and figuring out what I actually meant and what my hair needed. Also, I loved the atmosphere of the salon in general - everyone was chatting together and it felt like a fun hangout the whole time! My hair is feeling super happy and healthy after the visit. Will definitely come back!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcde0c5c02a927:0xaa15df1cd3a87b8b</Gmap_id></record>

It was my first time at Bishops and I had a good experience. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Amy gave me a haircut just as I described, in fact better. She was very professional and efficient. Overall, customer service at Bishops' exceeds your expectations!<//review>

This place always has my back. Ashley helped me out today to fix a pixie cut from another stylist that didn't turn out quite as planned. She was super helpful in helping me achieve the look I wanted, while also working with me to not cut the length much shorter.
Another time I came in and asked the stylist (whom I forget, so sorry!) to cut my hair shorter than I wanted, so it would grow into what I wanted in a few weeks. She nailed it perfectly!
I've had good luck at this place and they seem to have good intuition.  Going to make this my new spot!</review>

The best barber you have never heard of!  Very clean, spotless, you could eat off the floor.  Great environment.  Carlos cut my hair today and did a great job as well as being quick and efficient.  Daniel at the front counter remembered my name and was courteous and professional.  If there were 6 stars, Bishops East Irvine would get it!

Keep up the good work, Team Bishops -

Fantastic experience. Felt incredibly safe and protected through these pandemic protocols. Amy was both professional, and safe in practice. Her kind demeanor for myself and teenage son were great. She would always check-in with us to ensure we were happy with what she was doing, making sure we were getting the cut we wanted. Definitely book or ask for Amy, she does a great job on both my son, and my husband. Husband loves that she's so quick, and gives a perfect cut each and every time. Thank you Amy!</Text>

I had the most wonderful and safe experience. I absolutely love my hair. Brian did an amazing job and I left extremely happy. Brian listened to what I wanted and went beyond my expectations to make my hair feel and look great.The staff was also very friendly and it was an overall great environment to be in. I really recommend coming here and I will definitely be back.< /Review>

The entire staff here is amazing, and the prices are phenomenally fair! I came in to get my hair coloured and cut, and Kelly did an amazing job. They even offer a free beer when you get a cut, it's pretty neat (shame I don't drink)! Unlike some salons where they're not really on top of what's currently fashionable or trendy, the team here is up-to-date and I left with a wicked good pixie cut.

I am a transgender woman, and no one in the location even batted an eye when I came in, everyone used my correct pronouns and was super respectful. And as someone that is non-binary, I appreciate that their pricing for cuts is based on length and not gender. This is a safe space.

The decor is pretty great, too! I just love the aesthetic. If you need a cut for a great price, want your colour done, or any of the above, come over to Bishops!<//review>

<review>This place is great. Came here after years of middling to bad haircuts at cheapo chain salons and immediately loved the atmosphere and how attentive the stylists were to the details of my hair and cutting it in a way that wouldn't cause my cowlick to spring up and ruin it the next day. Prices were totally reasonable and the stylists were really friendly and engaging to talk to.</review><pics>None<//pics>< name>

This place allways does a great job on my hair and beard trim. The stylist took the time to line me up and was a perfectionist thruought. I would highly recommend this place especially Kelly. She is a master of her craft, and you get a beer with a haircut which is a plus in my book.< /text>

Avoid this place like a plague if you have facial hair and need it taken care of. The staff is just not trained to deal with it.

The owner was cool and reimbursed me for the haircut. Cheers!</review>

Haircut was ok but not exactly what I wanted. Stylist went to short and high for what I wanted especially considering I just wanted the same style I already had just shorter and a clean up. Prices do not reflect quality. Beard trim was poor and uneven by about an inch in length which is alot for a beard. Atmosphere is good and staff is friendly.

Overall average haircit but overpriced. Very bad beard trim, disappointed.</text>

<Rating>2</Rating><text>So I was reccomended this place by a friend and was told that they provide great service and that the cut would be well worth the price. This could not be further from the truth, they told me the wait time was 15 min and I thought that was weird since the place was devoid of any customers, anyways 15 minutes rolls around and no one calls for me. I asked the attendant and she said that since no stylist was around I would have to wait another 10 minutes, since I already invested my time I thought to my self "this better be a f*&%ing good haircut" and I and waited it out. When the stylish finally came around she gave me the eye, like she was expecting some else, I brushed it off and told her what I wanted, but as she was cutting she started to ignore my directions and went another route, I was going to say some thing but after the look I didn't want to make her mad. Overall the cut was mediocre and highly over priced the service was garbage and I strongly recommend that any potential customers go somewhere else.</text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1540854338550, 'text': 'Hi Andrew.

I Came from Utah and needed a good burger and was not disappointed with the cheese burger and great fries. My wife got an avocado burger and loved it. The avocado burger had too much avocado but that is an easy fix:)< /Text>

Ordered two #4. Turkey club. The turkey was  pressed turkey. Picked out the supposed turkey, which left a BLT on toast, lots of bread and lettuce. The French fries were good. I know they're trying to reopen and want them to do well. I'll go for something else next time.<//review>

We used the drive thru and purchased their steak sandwiches!, they serve up a pretty good sandwich.

A bit pricey at around $17 per person depending on customization but worth every dollar. Fresh food made to order. Pastrami cheeseburger has Pastrami on top and bottom which is an excellent touch. Come here when you have time to eat slow and enjoy every bite whilst taking in the scene.< /text>

Really good food. My favorite food to eat here is their pastrami sandwich, followed by the patty melt. But decided to get there nachos supreme and I was so glad that I did! It was delicious and very filling. There was enough to share if I wasn't so hungry. Their menu is pretty diverse and even have a few breakfast items that are available all day. Large parking lot and the drive thru is easy to navigate even with a truck.< /Text>

<text>Always enjoy ourselves every time we dine there, which is a few times per month.
New best item is the banana pudding, reminds me of being a kid again. Best pastrami’s around, even better than that other place down the Route. Burger combos can’t be beat. All the salads are crisp and large portions served. Sometimes it’s hard to make up our minds, but the servers there are always extremely courteous, respectful and always very patient.
Food is always served in about the amount of time that you would imagine, they don’t cook it till you order it, they don’t profess to be fast food but very tasty and enjoyable food.
We have never had a regrettable visit, keep up the good work folks you have much to be proud of!!!</text>< Gmap_id>

Great food, friendly staff AND the best chocolate *(Choc-O-Lot) shakes we've had in months and miles around.  Awesome '50s and '60s memorabilia all over.  You'lol be glad you paid them a visit once you've eaten here.   Shakes are the BESTEST !!< /Review>

The food is great the staff is very friendly. I had a breakfast burrito it was great. Just a suggestion you should be able to buy french toast or pancakes at anytime if you can make that happen they would be great. Today's visit definitely a 5 star. Once again if you can make that happened breakfast pancakes or french toast that will be wonderful

Thank you< /Review>

<Review>Last time I went here, not sure if their speaker in the drive thru is broken or the person taking orders is hard of hearing. But I literally had to scream my entire order at him. So frustrating. Then to top it off the fries were overcooked and under seasoned. Dry and almost plain. I paid $8 for a combo and they gave me a child size cup. They also didn't provide napkins.< /Review>< Pictures>

The 16 oz. drink is our small size that comes with the combo. We also give that size to the kids too.

WOW!  This was appealing outside and then the inside decorations were awesome and takes you back about 65 years.  The food was fresh, filling and yummy yummy.  Tonight they had homemade banana pudding for $1.75. A big portion at a retro price. We loved our experience and the workers were very helpful with whatever we needed. The owner came to our table to check on us. Really a fun time. Highly recommend this establishment.< /Text>

<text>The food is quite good and far too much! We ordered a large salad, a small onion ring, small fries and a large coke. The 2 of us couldn't eat it! The atmosphere, the legendary music make this place worth visiting. Classic place on the classic route 66.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>The food is great the staff is very friendly. I had a breakfast burrito it was great. Just a suggestion you should be able to buy french toast or pancakes at anytime if you can make that happen they would be great. Today's visit definitely a 5 star. Once again if you can make that happened breakfast pancakes or french toast that will be wonderful

Thank you<//Text>< Response>

I understand how that can be frustrating. Regarding the food you ordered, it sounds like we could've done a better job of being attentive. The 16 oz. drink is our small size that comes with the combo. We also give that size to the kids too. Combos can always be upgraded to 32oz, shakes or smoothies.Hope you'll give us another chance for a better drive-thru experience.

Last time I went here, not sure if their speaker in the drive thru is broken or the person taking orders is hard of hearing. But I literally had to scream my entire order at him. So frustrating. Then to top it off the fries were overcooked and under seasoned. Dry and almost plain. I paid $8 for a combo and they gave me a child size cup. They also didn't provide napkins.<//Review>

My first time there and went with a friend. Place is a little pricey, $13 talking about splitting a pastrami sandwich but it's a lot of meat and it's very thinly shaved. Unlike the hat and many other restaurants that seem to have good pastrami but just a little on the chewier side this is very thinly sliced and wasn't chewy at all. Probably one of the better pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. Just comes on a simple roll with mustard and pickles. I noticed everybody around me was eating fried zucchini fries as they refer to them which are the thinner zucchini like a french fry that are crispy all the way through not soggy on the inside. I decided to go for onion rings which were good but I've definitely had better. But they were tasty.  Saw they do fries, sweet potato fries, fried mushrooms. They also have a milkshake and ice cream bar ready to make you a Sundae.<//Text>

<Review>I have eaten at Legends in Upland before but my first time at this location. We got burgers which were ok. The onion rings i was not impressed with. My daughter got chili cheese fries and the chili is not that good. It reminds me of Farmers nasty chili. My boyfriend got the breakfast burrito which he was not impressed with. I felt it was overpriced and was not happy with the food. I won't be going back. I would ho to Terrys burgers in Upland next time where their food is so much better.<//Review><Rating>2<//Rating>< time>

Food was amazing.. Our first time. I know it's Sunday, the place was packed and very little choices to sit. BECAUSE EVERYTHING WAS DIRTY. Even spillage all over the floor. When they slowed down, then they cleaned the tables.. When we were leaving, we filled our sodas and there was no ice. And in either of the two machines. When I went to ask about ice I was told the only two employees that could do it were on break.. So no ice. Otherwise food was amazing..< /text>

<Text>It's a great place for small groups. It's also good for just families. We usually order a large sampler (fries, onion rings, fried zucchini, fried mushrooms), which is enough for the four of us and then a burger. Overall a great family dining experience.
1. Portions are very large and satisfying. Though it may seem pricey, each order is large enough for two meals.
2. This is a diner atmosphere so don't expect much more than that. However, the vintage memorabilia add to the ambiance.
3. Staff have always been friendly and helpful.
4. Parking has never been a problem for me, but I haven't been there at peak hours.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Diner was very nostalgic.  Felt like we went back to the 50's.  Cool decor,  if you're into that era.  Ordered classic diner food, cheese burger, fries and onion rings.  The burger was very cheesy and the meat was just the right thickness.  Reasonable prices and very friendly waiters.  Want to return for the milkshakes, which I've heard are delicious.</Text>

<text>Legends is one of my favorite fast food joints. The chicken strips meal with a salad is a great way to split lunch with my 6 year old. I love their salads. Their fries are great. I often get their taco combo. They have great breakfast burritos. The atmosphere is fun especially for kids. The food is always fresh. They have great desserts.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1518284326084, 'text': "Jenny, we're thrilled you're a fan of everything from the chicken strips to the desserts!

< Review>
The diner inside was cool...the food,not so much...I got a sampler platter  and it was mediocre barley warm,the fries were soggy and limp,the onion rings (2 our of 5) were burnt and cold,the mushrooms we're warm,as were the zucchini stix (but not fresh or hot)
So I took this and asked for the manager,after being told to wait,he could not be found,and a boy came up and said how can I help you I told him the situation and even showed him the onion ring and while standing there threw the burnt onion rings in the trash.he told me that he would tell his fry Cooks about them and that it wouldn't happen again ....and as he turned and  walked away,I said, 'Are you the manager?"and he said, well no, I'm the person in charge at this time. which obviously he was not the manager and they couldn't find the manager...and what should have happened is he replaced what I threw in the trash but he didn't.
So there's the one star ...
If I could give none I would.<//Review>

The food is good and large portions, but don't expect to get out of there spending less than $30+ for two.

Oh... We have ordered shakes and malts on numerous occasions and although their large malts and shakes are really, really large, they have a very different aftertaste; we don't order them any more.</Review>< Pics>

The place was clean, workers very nice( for that, 1 star) BUT...
The food was AWFUL. Really AWFUL. Drove from Bakersfield, Ca, approx. 100 miles. NEVER AGAIN !
Good Luck Ledgens, we went there about 10 years
Ago, I don’t know what happened, they really went

Legends has really good burgers and fries, the gyro sandwich is one of the best i have had, meat so tender and such a fresh taste. I also love their fried mushrooms and their shakes. Also if you like ice blended caffeine...  The cookies and creme drink is DELICIOUS! So good... A must try :)</Text>

<review>This one of my favorite Legends Classic Diners.  It is a ways from home however they have a very fun car show the 1st Sunday night of the month. You can't beat great food, great cars and good friends. They have great desserts and offer both Malts and Shakes all hand dpped and made fresh. Food is very large portions and I have yet to order and not love what I have received.</review><userid>116247507704685938383< /userid>< Response>

Their Gyro has lots of tender meat -excellent!  The decor is cool- socal diner surfer and it's always clean.  The staff is very friendly too!  Give them a try!<//review>< pictures>

Guitars, surfboards, street signs, a juke box, and if you sit in one of the table booths to eat, notice the old time soda bottle caps cemented into the wall.

<text>Food is just ok (the menu consists of Americana cuisine & deserts) but it is mostly the atmosphere, nostalgia and time warp feeling you get when you step inside Legends. I like going here when I'm in the mood for a lil warp back in time. No if only we could do that time warp backwards for all the high prices everywhere.</text>< Date>

A 50's themed diner, with a fairly broad menu.  Tasty enough.  Every Veteran"s Day, there is a great muscle car show there.  Nice cars, nice folks, low key affair and cheap (as in free for the car show, not the food - duh!)<//Text>

Pastrami burgers, zucchini fries, onion rings, french fries, chili cheese burgers, club sandwiches, tuna melts, breakfast burritos. All of them are fantastic. I love going here, even if my diet doesn't love it so much. Plus the classic decor is awesome, the walls are covered with classic stars. I find myself often staring at the wall decor every time I go.</Review>

<Review>Great retro 50's-60's dinner in the heart of Glendora. Menu consists of hamburgers, some mexican dishs and sandwiches for lunch and dinner with also a morning breakfast menu. They also have a kids menu.

Clean, but still needs a cleaning crew to go up a ladder, you can see dust on stuff  hanging on walls and lights and between  the seats/chairs, the counters, tables tops, service  and food they all get a 5 star there.  Just work on the dust and would  be a 5 star all around.< /text>

After leaving Doughnut Man, we saw the very distinctive sign, googled it and saw it had 4.5 (4.5!!) Stars and thought, man this place has to be good. The decor and atmosphere are the best thing about it, I think. Very cute, nicely put together. We got a classic cheeseburger with chili cheese fries and a turkey club. I gotta be honest, it was ok. Good but nothing to write home about.  It was a fun 30 minute stop, but I can't see myself going back.< /text>

<review>Pastrami burgers, zucchini fries, onion rings, french fries, chili cheese burgers, club sandwiches, tuna melts, breakfast burritos. All of them are fantastic. I love going here, even if my diet doesn't love it so much. Plus the classic decor is awesome, the walls are covered with classic stars. I find myself often staring at the wall decor every time I go.</review>< time>

The service was very slow. We were a party of 2, and 2 larger parties that came in after us received their food before us, our order was not a complicated order, a quesadilla and a salad.. There were more that 8 tables that were dirty and needed to be cleaned. Trash on the floor. None of the employees seemed concerned. The self serve soda machines were out of ice. It was not crowded,  time was 7:00pm.
Not to sure if we will return to soon.</Text>

< Review>
I ordered a pastrami sandwich, fries and a chocolate shake. The pastrami was a good size - especially with fries and a shake.  It was, however, a bit too dry for me. The fries were okay but the shake was really good. Nothing too special but I Di see some ice cream creations that looked great!< /Review>

If not for their amazing food, the visit to this diner can solely be based off it's amazing ambience and California in the 50s-60s decor. Always a great time at this wonderfully decorated diner.< /Review>

Foods always consistent. But the employees are rude, service is slow, and for the money would much rather prefer other places. Given this place plenty of chances to improve. Local place, want to like it. But at this rate we wont be returning<//Text>

<Review>Waited 20 mins. in line last night (which is expected for this place) just to get a cold burger and soggy fries. The young lady didn't know how ring up my order and didn't listen carefully while I was ordering. I don't mind waiting for hot food but making a customer wait and then giving them cold food is just disrespectful. My food was so cold I didn't even finish eating it. Also turning off the headset would be a good idea as I heard everything that was being said while the young lady was trying to figure out how to ring up the order. I definitely will be going to Grand Burger for now on.<//Review>< user_name>

<text>Not sure what has happened to legends, use to be great to come here but now every time I order from the drive-thru I get attitude from anyone taking my order and when I drive up to get my food. The last time I was there they burnt my stake sandwich and I had to wait over 20 minutes to get my food and it was only a small order.

I do enjoy the food when it's not salty but the wait in the drive-thru is getting longer and longer just for a few items.</text><time>1531010711612< /time>< response>

< Review>
Too much food, nothing healthy on menu. Everything I have ever had here was greasy, salty. That said, my family likes the chicken fingers and shakes here; I come along under duress.  The walls are covered on 2 1/2 sides with memorabilia that refers to, but is not from, the '50s.  The other 1 1/2 walls have a poorly drawn mural that these places all seem to have. Jukebox plays oldies, loudly at times. Bottom line: poorly imagined '50s dinner with below par food.</Review>

< Review>
Food wasn't too shabby for a diner. Huge meal cost a little over 20 dollars.

We had a bacon avocado burger with added pastrami a side of zucchini fries and to wash it all down with a thick strawberry milkshake.

Don't forget to bring cons for the juke box and take the extra time to look at all the paraphernalia on the walls.< /Review>

The staff has no grasp on how to assign and stay on one job, instead they talk and decide to do as little as possible, you can almost see how much the staff doesn't want to be there let alone how unprofessional these people are, i wouldn't eat here unless you want to have the stomach flu, the only thing the owner and his wife care about are yelp reviews.< /text>

It's our second time here in a month and the same effortless service from the same cashier, she doesn't show any enthusiasm and she doesn't seem to be happy with her job, it's a drag on what the restaurant's setting is aiming at, and it's a shame the service has gone down the drain, the good thing is they're hiring, maybe if you're reading this you can help make a better first experience for future customers. Overall great food at a reasonably price, thumbs down on the service<//Text>

Today was the 1st time we came to try this place out. I was looking for restaurants in Glendora, where my brother lives (he recently moved there). I found this place on here (I like to read reviews that also has the owner/manager replying back to the reviewer, this tells me that they care & a sign of great customer service 👍) & told my brother to meet us here for lunch.
It was a great place!!! I like all the decor, from classic license plates to photos of Lucille Ball, Audrey Hepburn, Betty Boop & lots & lots of memorabilias that I could just read & look at. This resto felt welcoming, spacious & nostalgic. It reminds you of the fun, good old days, no worries at all.... Oh BTW the food is very good!!! My sons like the chili cheese  burger combo, my brother had the pastrami (pretty good portion of pastrami 👍) & I had the mess burrito. Sooo many to choose from. They also have other condiments, 4 different salsas, huge jalepenos, onions/cilantro (I think that's what it looks like) & pickled small yellow peppers/carrots/onions. When we get a chance to come back I'd like to try the French toast, didn't make it before 11am ☹️, next time. Overall 👍👌</text>

<Review>Ever meet someone who is always with whatever is the hot in "thing" but you still dont want to be around them?

Thats kinda what I feel about Legends Classic Diner

Its amazing how you put a bunch of crap on the walls and people get all "jazzed" about a theme.

The real theme of this place is deep fried not that great food.

I have been here more times then I like to recall because it took quite a few times to convince people that this place just isn't good.

I will say that nothing is horrible. Just nothing stands out at all and considering how much fat is in everything and the fact I can bump into a Greek burger place with my eyes closed.

Almost everything deep fried is overcooked and dry. The food is also just bland.

Feel free to come here just dont come crying to me about it.<//Review>< gmap_id>
