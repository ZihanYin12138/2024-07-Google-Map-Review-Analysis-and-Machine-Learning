Bringing my cat to the vet can be a task since he is a stray and doesn't like getting into carrier. He also freaks out around strangers and he doesn't come out from under the couch for days. I hate putting him through unnecessary stress, but understanding the importance of up keeping  with his vaccines and wellness checks, my husband and I bring him to Especially Cats, where he is very well cared for by Dr. Ericka Carroll and the staff. I was quite impressed with the quick response and insightful follow up from Dr. Carroll. She is exactly what I would want my kitty vet to be, a cat lover who cares about my kitties and treats them well the way I do. When my cat comes back home from a visit to this vet, he doesn't seem stressed, he doesn't hide, and he eats right away, which just speaks about the great care he experiences when he is there. I am super super pleased with Especially Cats and I would definitely recommend them to any kitty owner who is looking to get the best care for their kitties!

P.S The prices are very accessible and they don't over charge or request procedures unnecessarily :)</Text>

Best bet for our cat who needed special kidney attention at a young age. Dr. Wilson not only explained the science behind but had incredibly empathy to our situation snd made age appropriate recommendations. Highly recommend them for your Kit Kat’s.<//text>

<Gmap_id>0x808f7d900a006709:0x25d38f22206c61f1</Gmap_id><text>I felt compelled to review after 5 years of using this vet office, it's gone downhill.  I love Dr. Wilson and see her exclusively.  However, the staff is just not nice anymore.  Very rude and impossible to actually talk to, cut you off, and don't listen.  Forget about being treated as anything other than a checkbook.  You can't leave a message or speak to the Dr directly, follow ups are sloppy, and after talking to the doctor for a new sensitive food diet, they send me an impersonal email with a dry food that the doctor herself told me that my cat couldn't have.  Trying to follow up with other direct suggestions from the doctor, but again, going through staff that clearly DGAF is frustrating.  I'm on the lookout for another vet experience and suggest you do the same.  If you must use them, see Dr. Wilson but be prepared to not be able to follow up or get questions answered.</text></record>

Bad experience: they add their own rules to the laws, which makes it impossible to issue a travel "health certificate" without an appointment 90 days before departure...</Review>

<text>Overall, really poor experience at Especially Cats and we've taken our kitten elsewhere. In general, the staff are difficult to get a hold of, rude, take a long time to respond to actions they said they'd take, etc. They get 2 stars because the vet seemed okay over the phone, but do not recommend this clinic at all.

A couple specific examples below:
- After our first visit during a weekday, they asked us to bring back a stool sample. We confirmed that we could drop it off on a Saturday (they said yes), but then when we showed up, the tech / front desk person was incredibly rude and asked us why we brought the sample on a Saturday. She tried to charge us 10x the cost for the sample. We were quoted ~$30 with the vet and she tried charging us ~$300. Fortunately, I refused to pay until she cleared that up. Then they never sent or called us with the results, I had to call them.
- On our 2nd to last visit, we were told our cat was getting tested for feline leukemia. We never heard anything about results. I finally called and they told me it was negative. Come to learn weeks later when I requested the records that they never actually did the screening.
- During a vaccination drop off, I was told it would take up to 45 minutes max. I told them I was going to wait because it takes me 20 minutes to drive each way. An hour goes by, no update on timing. Finally after 90 minutes and at risk of missing more work, I rang the doorbell. Again, super rude and they begrudgingly retrieved my kitten.</text><rating>2< /rating></record></dataset><record>

The staff, from the Vets to the Vet-Tech to Front Desk crew, all are helpful, caring, friendly, knowledgeable.   The staff genuinely cares about you and your cat.  I have been going there monthly for the past 6 years as my many toed Torti requires a careful pedicure.  Of course she has the staff completely fooled, they think she is just sweet and cute, little do they know that she has been a total skitzoid trying to get here to the vet today, leaving me totally done in.  But that's ok, that's what we humans are here for, I'm firmly convinced of it.  On a health note, hats off to the Vets for their progressive, modern medicine. They have kept my girl-kitty happy & healthy as she enters her middle age, I could not ask for anything more.<//review>

<review>Friendly staff is really what makes this place top notch. Also the the fact that they really care about every animal that comes in is a huge plus.

If you're looking for a vet for your cat, this is one of the best options around the bay area.

*Don't trust the review of Puja. That lady is obviously being a princess over one incident. I've cancelled last minute before and they rescheduled me for another day.< /review>< pics>

Especially great! This is the only veterinarian hospital that my cats will go to. They DEMAND that I bring them here and I no longer live close but still make the long drive. The vet technicians, especially Tanya, are amazing as are both Dr. Carter and Dr. Wilson. Dr. Wilson is patient, kind, compassionate and takes her time to explain every detail to you. She is wonderful. I also always meet nice people in the lobby who share tips and advice as everyone here are cat lovers. If you've got a cat, this is the vet place to go. Parking is easy (metered but you can use both coins and credit card) and there's a good coffee shop on the corner.</Review>

I have been taking my kitty to Especially Cats for years.  She is very shy and I didn't want to stress her out by going to a vet where there were other animals.  Dr. Carter has been her primary doctor for the past few years and she has been wonderful.  My cat was diagnosed with hyperthyroid disease and Dr. Carter was extremely helpful in giving guidance as to the best course of treatment.  Kitty is now cured via radiation treatments and I am very grateful.  Highly recommend.</Text>

I am a mom to a "difficult patient" (she even scares me when we go to the vet), but Dr. Carter has always been super compassionate and caring with my baby, even when she's growling and spitting. She does a great job of paying attention to my reactions and reassuring me as well! I also feel well-informed about the diagnosis and treatment options, and when my cat needed some teeth extracted, Dr. Carter did a great job. She and the office staff are also willing to file claims to my pet insurance for me, which is great! I highly recommend this place.<//review>

I recently moved to SF and I have been extremely happy with all of the folks I have interacted with as well as the services Bunny (my cat) has been provided. I love going to a vet where you can tell everyone there is also a cat person. Bunny and I have always been treated with care and respect. The prices are also reasonable and always discussed with me before anything is charged. As long as I live in the area, I will continue going only to Especially Cats.</Text>

I love Especially Cats. My two cats are elderly now, and I know I can trust the good judgment of Dr. Carter to see them through their golden years. Perhaps because they serve only cats, and therefore do not need to have equipment for every sized creature, EC saves a bit on overhead and seems to pass it on to their customers.Their rates are very good compared to other vets I've tried through the years. All the staff are polite and extremely helpful. I highly recommend Especially Cats.</Review>

Not sure if they are on lunch or super busy, but I called twice, left a message explaining what type of cat I have, that I moved and need to set up care here.  over an hour later tried to call again, but again no answer. Either someone is not doing their job (front desk) or the hours of the business are incorrect.<//Text>

After trying several vets in San Francisco and the Peninsula I wasn't really thrilled with the service I was receiving for my two kitty sisters.  I had heard good things about Especially Cats and read their Yelp reviews and they were stellar.  I decided to give them a try.

I was so pleasantly surprised at how cute the place is.  The office staff is great, so friendly and professional.  Me and my two kitties met with Dr. Carter, who was wonderful.  She was so friendly, knowledgeable and professional. They also have two other Vets on staff there, so someone is always available. Our initial visit included a complimentary nail trim for each kitty and $30.00 off the office visit for each one also.  You can download the coupon at their website.  The practice is also open 7 days a week, which makes it super convenient for anyone's schedule.  Parking is metered on the street, or you can park on a side street, no meters.  It is also easily accessible by public transportation.

I highly recommend Especially Cats for anyone looking for a great vet in San Francisco that specializes in our Feline Friends.< /text>

We have been bringing our cats to Especially Cats for 20 years.  We have worked with a series of excellent vets who have always provided expert and compassionate care for our cats.  They have seen us through the loss of beloved pets and guided us through extensive care for critically ill ones.  Referrals for specialists have always been excellent.  Especially Cats has been great for us and our feline friends.</review>

<review>I love Especially Cats and the high quality of care they provide. I'm lucky enough to live within walking distance and they have been accommodating with making quick appointments when My cat needed a vaccination before travel and when I worried about why he had peed on the rug.

I should also add I found their prices to be very reasonable for vet care in the city. Even if I move out of Parkside, I plan to continue care here. :)</review>< Pics>

We've been using Especially Cats for the last 18 years.  We've had many of our feline friends begin and end life with the vets at EC.  They have been, unequivocally, expert and available in everything we've needed from them.  Most recently, when one of our beloved elderly ladies became too ill to carry on, one of the vets came to our home all the way across town after her long day at the clinic, to do the euthanasia for us so we didn't have to take her back to the clinic to have it done.  We know it saved our old girl from having to suffer through the car ride which she hated, and it saved us from the burden of putting her through that. We are so grateful for that consideration. i can recommend Especially Cats without reservation.</Text>

<Text>We currently have six cats that range from 1- 16 years old. Over the years we've been to a variety of vets. However, once we discovered Especially Cats, that was it. Now, we only take our cats to Especially Cats and here is why: all of the employees at Especially Cats, from the vet techs to the vets, are friendly, efficient, knowledgeable and compassionate. If I email or call, a vet or vet tech always responds right away. The staff is also consistent. Unlike many veterinary offices I used to go to, the staff at Especially Cats has remained the same with no changes or turnover. That means they get to know you and your cats, and you get to know them. Not only does it make for a more personable experience, it means your cats get better care. Our experience with them has always been positive. I highly recommend them to anyone who loves their cat(s).</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<text>Great cat vets. They have more than one vet and Saturday hours, so it's easy to make an appointment, and they've never kept me waiting for more than 5 minutes in the waiting room. Parking is easy on their block; I've never had to park more than a block away. They're always happy to give me print-outs of my cat's medical records to keep in my files.<//text>< time>

<review>Friendly support staff and very knowledgeable veterinary staff who have been very methodical and understanding in their help for our two young cats. (We had older cats who were seen by another local vet, which was also good, but not as convenient or cat-specific as this place.) In short, your kitties will be in very good hands!< /review>< pics>

We love Especially Cats and bring our two feline family members here for all of their medical needs. We've never had an unpleasant visit here, everything is always clearly explained to us with options given. Reasonable prices, friendly folks.< /text>

Especially Cats have been taking care of our cats since they were kittens, 5 years ago. They have the best, most caring, most competent kitty doctors. Dr. Carter is simply amazing. One of our cats recently died of lymphoma (he was only 5) and we could not have gotten through it without Dr. Carter - she was extremely supportive, knowledgable, but also realistic. Everyone at Especially Cats is great.< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I recently adopted two feral cats after years of being a "Dog Mom".  The world of cats is new to me.  And incorporating two feral felines into our household would have been more challenging without the support of Especially Cats Veterinary Hospital.  Dr. Grace Carter is a compassionate professional.  She guided me through the process of properly caring for the individual needs of Jerry Rice & Blackie.   They are caring, competent and professional.  I highly recommend them!< /Review>< pics>

Dr Wilson was the veterinarian for my two cats Jasmine and Pippin. She's absolutely terrific. The cats are in great health because of her. Jasmine was sick with a viral infection for a long time and Dr Wilson worked hard to find a solution to get Jasmine healthy and it worked. She is great about getting back to you as quickly as possible when you have a question about your cats and their treatment programme. The staff is friendly, good about reminding of appointments, and do they little things like clip the cats' claws so efficiently when asked. I also appreciate that Especially Cats Veterinary Hospital only treats cats. That's their primary focus and I think that's why the hospital is so effective in caring for our cats.</text>

<review>We have been coming here for 8 years now, and I am very happy with the care that my two cats have received.  They have both had their share of health problems, and the doctors and the staff have always been incredibly patient and kind while figuring out the best treatment options.   The doctors have gone out of their way to do extra research for more difficult diagnoses, and always call me to check on our cats progress.
We also love that they specialize in cats, and I'm sure our cats appreciate the quiet  waiting room.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808f7d900a006709:0x25d38f22206c61f1< /gmapID></record>

<Text>Great place and wonderful staff!!  My wife and I just moved up to SF from San Diego...so naturally we had to find a new vet for our cat, August.  We were expecting to go through a few vets until finding the right one.  Fortunately for us, we found them right off the bat with Especially Cats!

Dr. Lindsay Wilson took great care of our little guy. :)  We'll be back sooner than later.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

<text>The doctors and staff are always friendly and professional.  Especially Cats isn't the closest vet office to where I live, but I go a bit farther because I appreciate their customer service and caring staff.  The dog-free office is appreciated by my cats. Dr. Buttar is "especially" great: he's gentle towards the cats, takes his time to do thorough exams, to ask me questions about them, and never seems hurried. When my 17-year old cat died, the office sent me a sympathy card; little things like that can mean a lot.<//text>< resp>

<review>I drive all the way cross San Francisco to take my cats to this place, they are THE BEST and also THE NICEST.  First started when my previous vet said my two Maine Coons needed substantial dental work and quoted a very high price.  I got a second opinion at Esp Cats - exactly the same diagnosis and about 75% of the cost.  The work was EXCELLENT, the cats not at all traumatized, the follow up care was spot-on, and their subsequent visits have been problem free.  This is a vet that will happily tell you if your cat needs NOTHING done, is in great shape and come back in a year for a check up - n o pushing of ANY products or services, just genuine heartful vet care.  I'm convinced, and so are the cats!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808f7d900a006709:0x25d38f22206c61f1< /gmap_id></record>

My cat is one of the most shy and easily scared critters around, but everyone at Especially Cats is so sweet during every visit and knows exactly how to make sure she's calm and comfortable while examining and treating her.

And although I moved to the opposite side of the bay, I still come here for the incredibly reliable services and fair prices. A+</review>

I have been a client at Especially Cats for over 20 years.  My cats were cared for with compassion and love by both the staff and the doctors.  Recently my cat passed away and I received the most considerate words from the entire staff in a card.  I truly believe this hospital deserves the recognition for outstanding service.</review>

Very happy to spread the great news that the Especially Cats Veterinarians along with their Assistants are so wonderfully caring, gentle and loving to our sensitive cat. We are certain the tender concern they exhibit while examining our cat is the same for anyone who is fortunate enough to bring their cat(s) to this clinic. We've been to business-like veterinarians in the past, so the gentleness here is much appreciated. Dr. Butar, Dr. Carter and Michael all made our Little Caesar feel comfortable with his maladies along with his awful infection.  His wound has healed beautifully by the way.  Just noticed their home site offers $30 off a cat's first exam.< /Review>

<text>I've been going to Especially Cats for over 20 years.  They have assisted me with Pharaoh, Missy, and Ramoth (all deceased) and now Black Jack & Coco Chanel the newest members of my family.  The doctors have always been wonderful when dealing with my furry family.  My friends with cats tell me horror stories about their vets and I always tell them to bring their cats to Especially Cats.  I like the fact that this is a cat only veterinary hospital and I don't have to worry about other types of animals upsetting my cats..  Love Especially Cats, they are the only place I will ever take my cats!<//text>< GmapID>

(Updated August 14, 2016)
Especially Cats has provided great service for the last 3 years.  They gave us same day appointments when we needed them, on about 5 occasions.  Drs. Buttar and Carter have seen our 13 year old cat for a recurring respiratory infection and on each visit have gotten a bit more aggressive to diagnose and treat the infection.  They also were careful to vary the medications to avoid developing a tolerance to the antibiotics.

We had used the SF SPCA Hospital for nearly 40 years, but when the SPCA told us that they were booked and could not see our cat, even after being told he was having serious respiratory issues (after a dental cleaning there 5 days earlier), we tried Especially Cats and got an appointment 2 hours later.  We are quite happy with the examinations, treatment, prices, location, and the follow-up.

Getting a same day appointment when needed (without being charged an "Emergency" fee) is a distinct advantage that Especially Cats provides.  We were able to get same day appointments each time we needed one (about 5 times).  Other routine appointments were always within an hour or so of the time and day we requested.  Appointment times were always honored and our cat was seen promptly by the doctors.

We found street parking right in front of the clinic on all but one appointment (in the next block on that one occasion), which makes it very convenient, too.

Sadly, our cat died of cancer a few months ago,  but the euthanasia process at Especially Cats was particularly gentle and caring.

If another cat adopts us, this will be our vet.</Text>

<Review>I took my (scared, skittish, born feral) kitten to Especially Cats for her first check-up, then again a few weeks later for follow-up shoots. Dr. Buttar was incredibly patient & did everything he could to make the visit as calm, quick, and painless for my kitten. The location has plenty of street parking (a must with a cat carrier) & the pricing was reasonable. I'll definitely be back!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Excellent care in figuring out the cause(s) of Kimmy's "pee problems". Dr. Buttar explained everything clearly to me so I was able to make an informed decision and consent properly to the tests I wanted to have done and the treatments I chose for my cat. He examined her thoroughly, phoned me more than once to follow up with test results and the next steps for her care. He was considerate regarding the cost of all of these things, and I did not feel that he recommended anything frivolously. Other staff were just as competent. I would definitely recommend this vet for cat-specific issues or unique problems with your cat.<//Review>< Pics>

My cat had to have some teeth pulled a couple of months ago.  She wasn't acting like her usual self in the days following and the staff at Especially Cats was very available and helpful in helping her get back to herself.

<Text>I called to let them know that I couldn't get my cat into my carrying bag and needed to reschedule the appointment because there was no chance my cat is willing to cooperate - she scratched me and bit me when when I trued to, many times. Today, I requested to reschedule for Saturday, and was told that they can't schedule me for any Saturday anymore with reason that I didn't show up once and cancelled the last minute once. Well, when I cancelled the last minute that was because I had migraine attack (I clearly mentioned that to the person I spoke to at the front desk). I don't remember not showing up without calling. Well mind you. You better hope you never suffer migraine!  I couldn't believe this is how they treat their client! I have been taking my two cats to them and both always have Saturday appointment. Maybe there was one non-Saturday appointment, but that as an exception. Each appointment i arrived in time of earlier, even so, we're not being seen 15-25 minutes later.. but did I ever compaint? No. until now. Well, I tell you what especially cat hospital; some of your front desk people are a bunch a snobs, no smile, no people-person. You'd think that people who work here will be people and animal friendly. Wrong! I'll take my business elsewhere. You just lost one client. Soon maybe more if this is how you treat your clients.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

< review>
My cat, Snowpea, had only been a patient with Especially Cats in the last year of her life, but the care she got was always very good. Then came the day when I learned that she had severe kidney disease. Rather than try to twist my arm to prolong her life to a miserable existence, like many vets would do, they understood that her time had come and euthanasia was the compassionate thing to do. The vet who came to my home, Dr Carter, was perfect: very gentle and very competent. When she arrived, her presence was so calming that my cat was immediately comfortable with her. Thanks to Dr Carter and Especially Cats, my cat was able to leave with grace and dignity.</review>

<Text>I switched from SFSpca pacific heights campus to especially cats a couple of years ago because they are much closer. I really liked them until now. I know they are not 24 emergency after hours but that is what places like norcal vet emergency does. Anyway, bianaca, my sixteen year old cat was dying her legs collapsed and she was so lethargic. I called ec on a Thursday and the were too booked to see her until Saturday so I made an appointment.  On Friday Bianca got worse so I called and begged them to see her any time that day. They could not. They were booked. I took her to NorCal vet emergency where she died in my arms. Ec specifically states on their website that during their business hours they are prepared to handle the emergency needs of our pets. They clearly do not care. They would not even look at my precious cat who told me me in her cat way that her time has come. I do not dislike ec, and I hate writing this type of review. But I am appalled that they would not help Bianca. That is their job!
Thank god bianca died with care and dignity and she never knew that someone did not care about her.
I am sorry, deeply sorry for this review.<//Text><user_id>102608563880386838686< /user_id>< Pictures>

<review>When my cat was spayed at this hospital I could see right away that she was in very good hands. When we picked her up we even received a few doses of kitty pain killers, which I though was awesome because I could see that she was still in pain. Be forewarned however, the place is pretty pricy.</review><user>102723306776171423069<//user>< Name>

In my experience, the new DVMs are not nearly as pleasant and do not show much compassion as the old DVMs.  My suggestions is that they deal with their patients in a less clinical way an show more compassion.

Over several years of our precious feline friend Tula's life, and through several different of its resident veterinarians (though you're allowed to choose among them), Especially Cats has proven specially friendly and helpful in both regular check-ups and in dealing with a particular problem of build-up in the urinary tract, from which Tula was successfully cured. The staff, also, have been amiable both over the phone and in person. I'd consider anyone's choice of Especially Cats to be an act of sustained love for a pet.< /text>

You gotta be kidding me. We went in for a follow up for my cat 2-3 months later after he got pancreatitis, and they couldn't remember the treatment. I mean, the vet not remembering, fine benefit of the doubt since they deal with a lot of cats, but they didn't even have it on FILE?! They never took record of it. Also it took me several weeks of emailing just to get them to tell me an action item that I could change my cat's diet. WHY NOT JUST TELL ME THE FIRST VISIT?! Well they want me to come back in and keep paying for these checkups. Please don't go here. I've only dealt with Dr Wilson, so is very nice, but not direct. Seems like I'm the Dr because it's up to me to ask all the questions on what I have to do, since the information isn't clear nor all offered up front. Example, took me 4 emails after our 2nd visit for me to know that I had to change my cat's diet and what food/brand/type to buy (still wasn't told where, that would've been a 5th email).</Text>

(They'd been so assured by her former family.)  After two or three weeks of perfect behavior -- and revealing herself to be a complete snugglebunny, anything but 'aloof" -- she suddenly seemed uncomfortable and began acting up in ways that looked familiar to me from working in the monkey house of a zoo.  Since most pets are not released for adoption unless they're most definitely neutered, I thought I could be wrong -- but Especially Cats took my suspicions seriously, identified the test that would prove it one way or the other, and helped me assemble the evidence.   The shelter vets re-examined her and performed the operation, making sure to tattoo near the scar so the question would not arise again.   She's gone back to being perfect, snuggly and MUCH more comfortable -- and trusts the crew at Especially Cats so much that she took a dental cleaning and tooth removal completely in stride.  Now, that's confidence in your doctor!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

My experience has been great with the new ownership at Especially Cats. The office staff is warm and friendly, and I feel very comfortable entrusting my cats' care to Dr. Buttar, the very kind and gentle new owner.

My cat Mitzi has recently had significant and rapid weight loss and seemed to be very uncomfortable. I took her in to see Dr. Buttar, and he spent a lot of time carefully examining her (particularly her belly), reviewing her blood test results with me, and explaining a preliminary diagnosis of IBD or possible early lymphoma. He went over treatment options, and provided a detailed estimate for an ultrasound, should I decide to have it done. I requested that the ultrasound be done to rule out a tumor, and was pleasantly surprised that they first tried it without anesthesia--much better for her. (It also lowered the cost for me.)

I really liked that Dr. Buttar first wanted to let Mitzi try to get better on her own by giving her a high-calorie diet, rather than moving directly to steroids. When she didn't show any response, he then moved to the more aggressive treatment of steroids.

Dr. Buttar has been open and honest in our discussions of Mitzi's prognosis, and I am hoping that her positive response to steroids means that she will be feeling better for a very long time. I feel very confident that she will receive the best of care by Dr. Buttar.

4/1/2015 followup to above review.

Over the past year, I have been very happy with Especially Cats. I have frequent communication with both the doctor and office staff, and they are available by telephone or email. Pet care and special cat food is expensive no matter where you go,and I feel that their fees are in line with other clinics in the SF area.

Now, if I could just catch Mitzi more easily on medicine night!<//text>

<Text>We have been going to Especially Cats for over 20 years. Our first set of cats lived until they were 17 & 18 years old and our new set now 5 years old.  We wouldn't trust any other vet hospital to take care of our cats. They have always been accommedating in an emergency and scheduling appointments. I would highly recommend them.</Text>< Date>

< review>
Especially Cats has been wonderful to me and my animals. We've met with multiple doctors because it's not always easy to schedule when a cat gets sick, and they've all been friendly, compassionate, and exceptionally helpful with my needs.< /review>

So our insurance company State Farm arranged for us to have a rental car with Hertz due to an accident we were in.  We recieve a text from Hertz saying our car is ready, however they do not state where they are located.  So after being on hold  for 10 minutes to get someone from their 800 number to pick up we are finally told where they are located and provided a phone number.  Upon calling them the manager indicates that they close at 5:00 and they will not let us in afterwards.  We let them know we are on our way and it appears we are 1 mile away however they said they will not stay for us.  Now granted this is after they sent us a text saying car will be ready, and we stayed on hold trying to find which Hertz to go to.  There is a reason they are going out of business, so you may as well take your business elsewhere, as it appears the employees have clearly already checked out< /text>

<review>When my wife and  I arrived to pick up our rented vehicle, my wife inquired if the vehicle had been disinfected due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we were told yes the vehicle had been disinfected two days prior to it arriving at the pickup location.

After completing the rental agreement, we were given the keys, and left to locate the vehicle. We located the vehicle, and were we surprised by how filthy the vehicle was.  We first did a walk around without the employee percent, outside the vehicle was filthy dirt dust ...the vehicle had Georgia lic plates and  looked as it was driven across the country and left. The vehicle was not washed, and even filthier inside with  the items (beach chair and shoe)  left by the previous renter.

This clearly indicated that the vehicle was not disinfected or cleaned.

After pointing out the items, the employee display and attitude as if it was too much of an inconvenient  for him to come out of the office and remove the items. The items were removed ... no apology ...He just walked away not to return or confirm if there were anything else in the vehicle, or taken the moment to do a formal walk around to confirm any damages.

After I express my notice of the vehicle condition and dirtiness, The employee stated because of the Stay and Shelter law all car washes were closed, in which I replied that within 1/2 mile from the location is a gas station with a drive through car wash, so that excuse didn’t fly.

So, my rating of this location and employee, is completely a negative one and would advise all customers to never use this location. For the simple reason....  lack of professionalism, concern and health for their customers.</review>< rating>

<text>I reserved a car for the July 4th weekend.  This was done June 20th and received confirmation.  the category was an SUV.  I am a gold member and have rented from the Whittier location many times with no problem.  I went the morning of July 3rd to pick up my car and I was told "nonchalantly"  that my SUV was not available and have a minivan..we tried to call you (as he shrugged his shoulders).  First of all there is a category for minivan and category for SUV.  If I wanted an minivan I would've reserved it.  Secondly this was the long weekend where there are no cars available, you don't just leave me a voice mail and say call me if you want a minivan.  Since I didn't return the call, I would think the care I rented is still available.  This tells me your friend came in and you gave them the car I reserved.  I looked at the employee immediately walked out.  I contacted another carrier AVIS who was able to provide me with a last minute SUV for the long weekend.  I felt that my gold membership and being a dedicated customer  had no value Hertz.  That said, I will no longer rent from Hertz!<//text>< Rating>

Adam,
I was extremely disappointed at the lack of customer service I received at the Whittier location. I had my reservation and no available vehicle on July 26th, 2019. I was told to wait 15minutes, maybe half hour for a rental to be returned. I waited an hour and a half with no luck and 5 of your employees could have cared less. I had a clear view of the back room and they were talking among themselves of personal matters with about 4 customers in the lobby with reservations trying to troubleshoot their own situations on trying to get rental vehicles on their own. I feel it’s a waste of labor having employees who are not being diligent in trying to remedy the situation.
Please contact me since I was unable to reach you by phone or text. As a longtime Hertz customer we need to discuss this situation.

Thank you,< /Review>< pics>

My go to rental place when visiting SoCal.  The Hertz staff is always polite and don't over push by trying to get me to upgrade or rent me the entire fleet.  The facility is very clean and easy to get to.  My most recent rental experience was fantastic.  I was able to get in and out in a very reasonable about of time.  (Thanks Hector!!)  I was also able to extend my rental car at a very reasonable rate (Thanks John!!).  I will return to rent a car again.< /text>

<Review>The location is very dirty inside. They don't have many rental selections. They usually have 2-3 people working there. One is either taking a lunch break or dropping off customers to their drop off point and the other is helping customers. So expect to wait, being that there is only one agent attending to the customers with a rental or return. Be careful with them trying to charge you a smoking fee when you return the rental. I'm not even a smoker!<//Review>< username>

During my one hour rental experience i was contemplating if the employees even posed basic social skills, that thought was pushed back when I realized that my rental car was filthy and the gas tank was below half empty. The cherry on top is having a random call saying that I damaged the car. Yay Hertz!< /Text>

Great customer service and experience!  I feel like the staff here isn't phony and they don't push uneccesary fees or insurance on you.  I do see people complaining about wait times, however that's never been the case for me personally.  I've waited maybe 5 minutes in this location and haven't had any issues calling for inquires. This is definitely my preferred place for rentals.</Text>

<review>First off, I have service dogs and read VERY CLEARLY that I am allowed to travel with them. I didn't this time but i have fur almost always on me. Its something that can't be helped. When returning the car, i was told that i was going to be charged a 300 fee for them to vacuum it out. But since it was raining, THEIR wash was closed so either i pay the 300, or take it myself to vacuum it out. I am now soaked from head to to based off a lie. No where in my pamphlets nor site does it say anything in regards to pet hair. I dont appreciate being lied to, I dont appreciate the way the guy acted, nor do i appreciate getting wet for doing HIS JOB! Hertz was very unprofessional and I will not be a returning customer.<//review><Date>1543513331143< /Date><user_name>raechel lockridge</user_name>< resp>

<Review>I don't think the people who work here can tell their dick from their face, if you call them and they tell you there is a car ready for you do not believe them cause you'll waste you time and gas driving down there. Place is ghetto and unprofessional</Review>< date>

Infinity was a 2017 ,  nowhere as good as a Yukon or Tahoe , kind of stiff has a blind spot , but it had the room I needed so they got me . Hertz is never treated me this way must have been one of those mishaps, if you ever Rent A Car make sure you get it written in blood that you have the car you ask for, cuz they say well I didn't make the deal, it wasn't me you talked to, what the hell does that have to do with anything, it's the company you're in business you have people's lives entrusted in you, I guess some people don't know how important they are in these service jobs,<//Text>< Pics>

<time>1498202691148< /time><rate>5</rate><text>I posted a terrible review a couple of years ago when my daughter needed to rent a car. Things have changed dramatically!

I reserved a mid-size SUV for 1 week. When I arrived to pick it up they only had a larger SUV but upgraded me for the original price. I extended the rental an additional week for the same rate. I returned the car at the end of the period and was checked in quickly. I was on my way in just a few minutes. I wouldn't hesitate to use Hertz the next time I need to rent a vehicle.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>Absolutely the most awesome place 😎 the owner and his son are phenomenal people. They truly both love games, card games, board games. They will talk to you about it and you will see what passion looks like. We appreciate coming in and meeting some of the coolest folks we have had the pleasure. If you or your kiddos are into trading cards, books, board games...this place...will open up passage ways to your heart and stick with you forever.< /review>< Pictures>

Lots of games and comics. This is one of the few local gaming stores left in our area, and has been a reliable place for gamers to shop for years. I do wish they would keep their business hours updated on Google, Facebook, and their window sign though. They always seem to be closed when I try to shop there recently, and I would rather shop local than save a couple bucks on Amazon.<//text>

Barry is one of the coolest shop owners I've known for over a decade now. If he doesn't have it in stock, he will either order it for you or investigate how to get it for you. He knows multiple game systems and many different comic lines.</Text>

I came here recently to satisfy my quarantine needs (board games and roleplaying games). I was met with one of the most friendly and knowledgeable people behind the counter. I asked a zillion questions and everything was answered to the best of his ability. The store had a massive selection and a far wider variety of games than any other store in the area.
I ended up leaving with the Cities and Knights Expansion to Settlers of Catan and countless future games that I plan to buy soon. Fast forward to the evening and I open the shrink wrapped from the manufacturer game.

I was missing a sticker pack. A really simple error by the manufacturer and not the end of the world. Regardless after spending a good chunk of money on a game I want the whole package. I contacted North Coast Roleplaying about how to resolve the issue and have been given the best service. I have had to jump through a few hoops and make several calls to the store. Each time though I have been assisted and helped far beyond my expectations. I know that if I am back in the area and in need of games this is the first place I will go, I would likely choose this just for their selection alone but the service and assistance truly seals the deal. I have been blown away by it and would highly reccomend anyone to swing by the store!< /text>

Tons of great options for new and exciting games! Plus they have a good space for playing if you need it. I only wish they had more dice sets for sale but the coolest ones are just d6's, unless there's more somewhere I missed.</review>

If I were looking for a copy of the 1936 first appearance of "MELVIN THE WONDER FLEA" in fine to very fine condition, Barry would find it for me in less than a week at about half my expected budget. Best games and comics shop in Northern California.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>The owner is a great well of knowledge on a large number of subjects. I sometimes ask about vague older stuff (Knightmare Chess, as an example.) And, not only did he know more about it than I did, he had it buried under some other games on a wall and knew it was there. Great recommendations for comic books and a great knowledge of Trading Card games. (Also the best price I've seen on unopened boxes of packs of cards which he also charges on a "mix n match" basis.)
Although the store is dimly lit and housecleaning is not perfect, neither of these diminishes the experience.< /review>< pics>

<review>Best local selection of games. Lots of comics as well. Some space for gaming. A little pricey compared to online of course, but a great place to find some gems that are out of print or otherwise unavailable.

<Text>Store is in a decent location, has a good at showing of products, but the inside is really dark the floor looks like it hasn't been cleaned since the store opened, there's dust on a lot of the products and shelves, watch your step though there is a lot of products and boxes all over the floor. The guy behind the counter who might be the manager owner about sure seems friendly enough, but I would check some of his knowledge for yourself</Text>< Pictures>

<rating>5</rating><Text>This is the only comic store left in town. I go here every week. Barry (the owner) has a high energy level but is courteous and extremely helpful. I have never seen him verbally abuse anyone, no matter how rude they might be. I see him bend over backwards almost every week to please his pickier customers and wait patiently on clueless newbies. I've never seen any prices raised overnight. On the contrary, he has an ongoing sale of graphic novels which he sells for 3$ a pop which is one of the best bargains I've ever seen. It is not easy to run a comic or gaming shop and I think he does a great job. I'm grateful every week for his shop. If you buy your comics online you are not supporting your local community.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

DO NOT BRING YOUR COMICS, GAMES OR CARDS HERE FOR TRADE!  As a test, I brought in some comics today and was offered between 2% and 15% of their actual value.  Moreover,  he was dishonest about the true value of my items.  There are better options all over town, from pawn shops to private buyers on craigslist, that will give a more honest account of your items and their value.< /Text>

This is much more than a comic book store as the title might indicate. There are games for all ages and levels of complexity from board to miniture and a large collection of RPG. The owner has a nack for finding rare and out-of-print stuff as well.<//Text>

<Text>Okay selection, for a small-town shop.  The owner, unfortunately, ruins it; he's the only game (as it were) in town, knows it, and feels entitled to create a hostile environment as a result.  It's like he thinks he's running an exclusive club for his buddies rather than a bookstore (even a specialty one), or really any kind of small business at all.<//Text><rating>1</rating>< Response>

Barry is very nice and i love the store. his prices are just fine they arent sky high and they are high enough that he (hopefully) wont go out of business for a very long time. also i have never seen him say one mean think to anyone in his store he deserves the credit for what he is doing and he is doing it well!< /text>

The employees here are knowledgable and while they can come across as gruff, their hearts are in the right place. The only downside is that compared to other game stores I've been to, NCRP's pricing is steep for a lot.

A case of miniatures down south cost me 94 bucks. Here it's 120 easy. I could order them from Oakland, ship them here, and still save 10 bucks even if I express shipped it.<//text>

NCRP has a good variety of comics, Role Play books, and games. Barry is the owner if I recall right, and is a nice guy even if you don't really know him that well. It's also the last comic/rp store in the county far as I know. A island of hope in the middle of a sea full of dull people, and nothing to do.</review>

< Review>
On Free Comic Book Day the owner said they would be participating but in reality just put out a bunch of old Halloween freebies and Preview issues that are available 365 days a year. Funny he thought he would get away with this without anyone knowing. A "regular" asked where all the good stuff was, and he told him to "come back later when all the transients have left," referring to us little people that don't go in there on a weekly basis (I buy most of my comics digitally). I bought an issue out of gratitude for what I know is a very hectic day of handing out free comic books, but now that I know this guy is a scammer I would like to do something other than what I originally intended with said comic book.

He's rude to his customers and clearly has lost any passion he once had for his business. Don't go here, go buy your stuff digitally instead.< /Review>

I've purchased sourcebooks and supplements here before, reluctantly. The selection is sparse, the atmosphere is very unwelcoming, and the prices are unreasonable. However, given the area's few similar establishments, I'm still glad NCRP exists at all.<//review>

The shop itself is depressing to say the least. The lighting is dim, the carpeting is a faded shade of blue. most of the customers were males in their 30-40. including myself there were two teenagers. the biggest thing that was happening was a man talking to the clerk/manager about a D&D dining room piece. when i imagined it the comic book store was filled with colorful lights music and upbeat energy. I did not find any of that in this store.< /review>

<Review>Some cool nerd stuff. But it was ruined for me. They guy kicked me out after 10 mins of browsing. He said it was because I was "hanging around" and "he didn't like that". Not saying it was cus I'm black. But the tweeker hanging around the back of the store didn't get bothered.</Review>< pics>

<Text>Updated,
So I am gonna take a minute and say just how overly satisfied I am with my order.
I called them Sunday around noon and expressed how NOBODY in my immediate area (Redding, Ca) had the product (Shadowrun 6th edition beginner box) that I had been looking for in stock.
Barry at North Coast Roleplaying (4 hours away)told me that they had it in stock and would ship it immediately the very next day if I would like.
I was a little hesitant dealing with a mom and pops establishment but decided to do it.
I called him back 15mins later and gave them my Credit info and Shipping info, 3 days later it is sitting at my front door giving me exactly what I wanted at cheaper than Amazon Shipping AND FASTER SHIPPING.
Even though I pay AMAZON over a hundred bucks a year for two day shipping (WHICH NO LONGER IS 2 DAY SHIPPING) I would have received this item after our get together date of this weekend which by AMAZON calculations would have been next Friday (Not two day shipping)

All in ALL to sum this up, this transaction has been above and BEYOND my expectations and renewed my trust in Mom and Pops businesses,
If I ordered roleplaying stuff I more often (And I was RICH) I would go ahead and hand 100 bucks(the money I give Amazon for 2 day shipping) to Barry and his staff for his excellent communication and a overal great transaction.
Please if you are needing anything to do with roleplaying I URGE you to try these guys, they are FANTASTIC!
I will  continue to call them any chance I have in the future as should you if you need any role playing items or board games or for comics for that matter!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<review>My wife and I have lived in Eagle Canyon now for almost 2 years.  We love the community. It also feels safe here, nestled up on the hill overlooking the city.  And the staff are responsive and helpful.  This really is a great place to live and we are going to be sad if we ever have to move away.< /review>< user_id>

<Text>This place has been amazing- from great staff to great community. We’ve been here for a month and they made the transition (especially during a pandemic) seamless and easy.

The property is well maintained, quiet, GREEN, friendly and has been the calm that we needed- especially from moving here from downtown Long Beach.

Also great amenities - pools/hot tubs, fitness center, tennis court, GRASS.

Pics are from around and or views from within property.</Text>< pics>

<review>This has been a great place to live! I’ve been here for about 8 years now. The exceptional maintenance here really has a lot to do with my overall happiness at this apartment complex.

<review>It has been a great 3 years living in Eagle Canyon for 2 reasons: as a disabled veteran  with a service dog, the community is conducive for a good walk and is well-kept and the staff (office and maintenance) are very helpful and nice. Repairs are done in a timely manner. Thank you for a great living experience at Eagle Canyon!< /review>< pictures>

<text>My boyfriend and I are currently looking for a new apartment complex to move into for the new year. We have seen quite a few places but very little compare to the Eagle Canyon Property in Chino Hills! The property itself is gorgeous, the community is well kept and the units themselves are in great condition! Shannon was willing to squeeze us in during a busy Friday and was so warm and welcoming! She was very knowledgeable about the property and did a fantastic job at walking us through our options and answering my long list of questions! While we haven’t made our decision yet, Eagle Canyon is definitely at the top of our list and we are excited to continue to work with Shannon!<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1574870502847, 'text': 'We are thrilled to have earned your positive feedback!

I applied to eagle canyon apartments and got a approved I couldn’t make it back in time for my move in date a lot of my work I do is out of state . The manager Stephanie basically took my deposit money and said I can’t get because I had 24 hours to cancel . None of that was brought to my attention very rude lady and unprofessional they will take your deposit money even if you don’t move in!</Review>

<review>Eagle canyon was a very interesting experience to say the least. The community itself is wonderful and the woodsy area is amazing. Makes you feel like you’re not that close to town. The pools and hot tub were a great touch too. I unfortunately didn’t have all the wonderful experiences most tenants have had. My apartment was constantly being under attack almost the whole year I was there by pest infestations as well as pretty much all my appliances had to get changed out due to mice pooping in the back of it or it’s just plain crapping out because they were old. It took over two months to trap and kill those stupid mice after constantly having maintenance  and the exterminator out sealing stuff off as they kept scratching through. We also started off in the apartment without it even being fully cleaned. The shower and bathroom were not properly sanitized and the bathtub was cracked and was never fixed even after Multiple attempts with a certified contractor out. Each time he came it never fully got fixed. Communication at the office was not the greatest or timely but the maintenance team especially Jason and the younger blond guy (I can’t remember his name) were super helpful and so kind to us during this whole fiasco. I can’t say enough about those two. They were wonderful.</review>< Response>

<user_name>Geoffrey Hahn< /user_name><text>This is a pretty nice complex.   Being a bit older, they have an absolutely amazing maintenance crew!  It's well situated, with plenty of restaurants, a Harkins movie theater, and even a Costco within walking distance.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  Stephanie and Shannon in the front office are always cordial and ready to answer any questions, while Jason and the maintenance crew are just fantastic.  The amenities are nice, with a decent weight room that I never use plus two pools and two hot tubs.  Elementary and middle schools are nearby, with the elementary school literally around the corner from the complex.< /text>< date>

<Text>My wife and I just had our appointment with Shannon to visit the facility, and she was extremely helpful and knowledgeable regarding all of our questions and preferences for potential spaces! Everything we were looking for was carefully considered, and although I won't be a tenant until next month, I'm looking forward to what the future with Eagle Canyon will bring!< /Text>< pictures>

<text>We were so happy with our experience in moving into Eagle Canyon apartments this past March. Jacqueline did a fantastic job of showing us the available apartments and answering all of our questions. When a particular apartment that we like but wasn't available became open, she informed us immediately so that we could put our application in. The application process was easy and stress free and did not keep us waiting for approval. Once approved, the entire staff here was very accommodating in ensuring that we had everything we needed and following up on our immediate maintenance concerns. We are excited to be here!<//text>< pics>

The apartments and community are nice. Rent goes up significantly each year even if newcomers are getting your pre rent raise price (not as a special). The maintenance guys plus 1 very sweet lady are great, super attentive, always have perfect follow through, acknowledge you and smile. Our favorite person here is definitely JASON! He gets the job done quickly and correctly the first time around. Not only that he’s never too busy to have a quick genuine hello and ask how you are. He’s definitely my families favorite and I think he’s the only one we all know by name lol. Jason gets 5 STARS from us!<//text>

The team at Eagle Canyon has all been very welcoming and responsive in our time living here.  Maintenance team is capable, helpful, and professional.  It is a quiet community for the most part, clean and located close to all sorts of goodies like boba, Costco, 24 hour fitness, and lots of good food.  Only cons would be that the new paint still hasn't stopped smelling, and the painters apparently decided to cut our wifi cable while they were in here painting (so we had to get a Spectrum rep out here to do our wifi install, the cut wire was inside the wall so we could not see it, were just wondering why there was no internet even though the modem said "Connected").  Everything else has been great, would definitely recommend living here. :)  Older apartments but still nice.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c32d665c991e67:0x3aeb8d87e984b7ee<//Gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<Text>While returning the apartment ,they charge you cleaning fee and painting fee no matter how you clean it.
I cleaned and vacuumed the whole apartment but the manager said they will repaint and clean any way.  So you need to pay for it.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
The location on Ave J and 20th St West is such a great location for Subway. The staff is friendly and takes the art of the Submarine Sandwich seriously. They are courteous and make sure that your sandwich is made just the way you want it. You want extra veggies? This location isn't shy to accommodate your tastes. Keep up the good work guys!</Review>

<review>I received a $1 off a regular sub coupon so I called in and asked if it could be applied to a wrap. The male associate was very rude and told me no. So I go to place an order for a regular sub online. Right after, I notice the coupon didn't apply. So I immediately called in and got the same associate. I asked him to cancel the order and see if he could issue a refund. He told me he'd cancel it but wouldn't and couldn't give a refund. I asked for a manager, he replied one wasn't in.

I asked what I should do. He told me I'd have to contact Subway directly because he already hit confirm. I couldn't believe I'd have to waste so much time because he wouldn't help me in any way. I also know full well he was lying about not being able to issue a refund on an item I didn't receive and was never even made in the first place.

This is the worst Subway franchise I've ever been to.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Yum, yum yum yum ... You really get to eat fresh my favorite is the spicy Italian... the sandwich artist will cater to your liking. Salads, subs, soups, pizzas, sodas, and snacks.<//review>

As a former employee at this location i know they portion less than at other location however if you ever want more vegtables and ask they will always give you more the meat/patties costs extra to add Subway has a portioning list the list goes on somewhat like this 8 (2 patties/tray) slices of meat on foot longs 4 (1patty/tray)slices on six inches and on a kids meals its two slices or one scoop of tuna. They are very sanitary always washing hands elbows etc and don't make bad subs.<//Review>

No complaints about food or service here, would rate this higher but subs just aren't my favorite food and I only went here because I was outvoted. Also, some dude tried to mooch a meal off me and watched us eat the whole time we were there.<//Review>

I ordered a tuna salad, I received a half salad compared to other Subway's.  This, even after asking for more ingredients.  The salad I received tasted good, just not the amount I am used to getting.</Review>

I was walked through the simple process of joining the club and got a nice discounts for doing so. I was then taken care of by Amber who was able to answer all the questions I had and helped me find exactly what I was looking for. Great place , Great prices ,and Amazing employees.

Good place, but owner/management doesn't believe in CC business. They only want cash. Recently, as of May-21 (last visit) they accept CC, but will charge you extra for CC transactions, which in my view is pathetic so will not get my business as ther are so many of th see folks once WEED is legalized<//Review>

<Text>I live in the high desert, I use to drive mi to get here but never agian the attendant helping me looked confused and high she couldn't find any of the products took about 5 minutes just to get everything together, I only got three items
Didn't ask how my shopping experience also didn't try to upsale me on anything I was about 11 dollars away from their promotional items any good budtender would have pushed me to get an edible or something small so I'd spend more money and make it to the promotional offer, she literally just wanted me out of her face it was the most horrible experience I've had buying weed. I'd recommend any place over this and it's so sad because this was my favorite place crazy how one untrained person can ruin your whole experience.<//Text>< date>

Culture Cannabis Club did it again!  This might be one of the nicest stores I've ever been in.  Not one of the nicest cannabis stores, one of the nicest stores period.  The staff is amazing and knowledgeable and the prices are very good.  Bravo!</Text>

Amazing!!!! First and foremost this place is so beautiful inside, it’s clean everything is so neat and organized and it’s just overall superrrrrr beautiful. Secondly, the receptionist was very inviting explained everything clear and concise and was very nice, last but not least once I entered I was immediately greeted by the sweetest lady, I wish I would have gotten her name but she had amazing electric pink hair! I explained to her the previous dispensary I went to they weren’t entirely informative and me being new to this I needed more information. She explained the difference between the two strains and the highs and helped me pick out serve all different items. So thankful for her! Checking out was a pleasant experience as well very nice gentleman and I even got an added item for 1 dollar!
If you want all your needs met this is the place you need to go.</Text>

<text>The atmosphere is really nice, the budtenders cool, and the way they have samples set up is nice.
However, much like other walk-in dispensaries, price is an issue. If you want an ounce, you're not getting a break unless you want mids.
With tax an oz of exotic is going to be in the range of $430. You can get the same delivered for $250 and the buds are twice as big.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><rate>3</rate><resp>None<//resp><user_name>Jon Jones</user_name>< UserId.>

{'time': 1617592054101, 'text': "Edward,\n\nWhat an interesting and thorough review. Thanks for taking the time.  Let us address a couple:\n- The names may be the same strains or similar but it's not the same cannabis.  Because we are recreational (vs. Medical) our cannabis is tested to the parts per billion for any particulates or impurities. That basically just means you're smoking the purest thing you ever smoked and it's essentially cleaner than breathing air.  That's why you pay a bit more in taxes in  CA vs. AZ.\n-Also stains of weed sometimes become popular, so it's not surprising you find them around in multiple states. We do pride ourselves in having a wide selection so I'll look at our current menu and make sure we're meeting that standard.  We do have Chernobyl, Trainwreck, Ice Cream Sundae, and Calm 134 that might be a little different and we recommend.\n-I pulled up your receipt and good news you to rest assured, you did in fact get your 25% discount. Just contact us if you would like a copy.\n\nBut overall is sounds like this wasn't a 100% experience you enjoyed so we'll make it right.   We are putting a note in your account in case you return, you'll get that discount back and we'll do the dance again.  Hope you're enjoying your road trip just the same and we hope you enjoyed what you consumed. Good cannabis tends to make things feel better.  Enjoy."}</Response>

We are in Cali for a wedding and getting a little burned out on the local weed in our small town. So, we researched dispensaries and chose Culture Cannibis due to it's proximity to the freeway. We should have done more research! This place offered the same products as we get back home in AZ. Do si do, Gelato, Wedding Cake and more. If I don't like those products at home, why would I here?? New customers are supposed to get a 25% discount but I'm still stinging from the price we paid. $93 for TWO 1/8ths! One was strawberry trix and the other is Dreamcatcher. For some reason, we couldn't get a receipt. We waited for 5 minutes, just for that receipt until we finally gave up. But I'm pretty sure we didn't get that 25% discount on weed that doesn't even work for us! The place is fairly clean and the very young employees are ok. What I would like to know is why aren't the baby boomers (who spend a lot of money on weed) represented in the sales force? Instead, you have young people getting irritated by the questions you ask and treat you like a cheapskate of you don't want to spend your entire vacation budget on weed.</review>

Great sushi! Huge portions! Prices are definitely reasonable for the size of the sushi and I thought the quality was good. It’s not usually too crowded either and they have an extensive menu. Also, the size is quite large so a single roll for each and a small one to split is good for two people.< /text>

I like the atmosphere of the place and the menu had different options besides the sushi, the prices were acceptable and the taste was good. The servers needed to loosen up a little but overall wasn't a bad choice.< /review>

<Review>We absolutely love Matsu Sushi Dublin. The service and food is second to none. They have a very large menu and we've yet to try anything that isn't simply amazing. 😍🍣🍱🍜

If you don't know where they are it can be a little difficult to find. They're located in the Hacienda Crossing Shopping Center next to Tutti-frutti and Fiveguys.< /Review><user_id>116884429227183681706</user_id>< gmap_id>

<GmapID>0x808fe94b7cdbac29:0xb0e128c20194748d< /GmapID><resp>None< /resp><Text>They had very poor service. The food was over priced and really gross and old tasting. The portions are also pretty small compared to most sushi places. I ordered 1 sushi roll and it took them over 30 minutes to make. That would’ve been fine if they were busy, but there were only 4 other people in the restaurant. All of which already had their food. The entire time I ate, the staff would give me dirty looks, start speaking in another language, and then smile at me like they weren’t just talking trash. Very much so felt like I was going to a nail salon except this is a place of eating and is held at a high standard. After my meal, I had the worst stomach pains. Nothing was as it should’ve been for a sushi restaurant. I wound NEVER recommend that other people ate here.< /Text><rating>1</rating>< Name>

Disgusting food with over expensive price. Would never come back again, and I recommend you guys to never eat at this place. Service is also terrible, won't even give me any napkins after the meal. My son even got sick after eating here.< /Text>

The only thing better than a movie on date night is a movie and Sushi!!  The service and portion sizes are good.  Never too much rice or sauce on any of the rolls.  While we always order a Caterpillar roll, our current favorite is the Love roll!! Whenever possible we try and sit at the bar... watching the sushi chiefs is always amazing!!!!<//Review>

I have not tried there bento box but my friend who have say that it is pretty good too. Close to regal cinema, this is a good place to catch meal before you go for a movie.</text>< pics>

<Text>The sushi was fine but the udon was absolutely terrible. Beef tasted like cardboard and the soup had a really neutral, bland flavor. Noodles were bland too. Do not get the udon.

I don't know how this place as these many good reviews. Their food was not fresh at all. Had no taste and even the presentation was weak.
I would not be going to this place again.< /Review>

<text>Our favorite Sushi and Japanese Grill in the Tri-Valley. The waitstaff here is fabulous and very attentive. We've yet to order anything that wasn't amazing, as their sushi is some of the freshest and tastiest we've ever had. Best of all they take special requests which is great since we're not the biggest tuna fans. Even writing this review is making my mouth water... Guess we'll be having sushi 🍣🍤🍱🍜 for dinner.</text>< Pictures>

Love the food and service at Matsu Sushi Dublin Japanese Grill. The new ownership has already made a noticeable improvement.  Restaurant is always clean and the wait staff is very attentive.<//review>

<user_name>Natalie Healy</user_name><time>1554100998418<//time><text>First time here and honestly nothing amazing.  The rice was sticky, and the vegetables, well the cucumber tasted old and soggy. The mango roll was ok, the Rock and roll sushi roll was the same it was ok. Nothing compared to the Yanagi Sushi & Grill Dublin. The last was nice the other two gentleman were not and overall won't be badly again. The food tasted old and not fresh. The reason I went here is due to the Yanagi being closed and opening at 5pm this place was already opened and had decent stars and reviews.< /text>< rate>

You'll find us at Matsu Sushi Dublin anytime we're out in the Tri-Valley area. The quality and freshness of their fish never disappoints. Servers are friendly and attentive.<//text>

Great food, went on Superbowl Sunday and the staff, despite potentially resenting work and would rather join the festivities of the superbowl, we're more than friendly and accommodating. Thanks Matsu team!</Text>

<Review>Yum, yum, yum!! Consider this your warning... the food at Mastu Sushi in Dublin is highly addictive :)

We're sushi lovers and this spot is easily one of the best in the bay area. Quality and freshness of their fish is amazing.  The staff is super nice and attentive.  Like most sushi restaurants we recommend sitting at the sushi bar to watch these guys in action... super cool.

The location is a bit tough to find though.  They are in the Hacienda Crossing Shopping center on the same side as Tutti Frutti.

See you soon Matsu Sushi!!!!<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating><GmapID>0x808fe94b7cdbac29:0xb0e128c20194748d</GmapID><Name>Martellas Art</Name>< response>

Dined here a couple of times with family and friends and have never been disappointed.  The sushi and sashimi boat is always fresh and yummy.  We love this cozy and relaxed gathering place for authentic Japanese food and grilled fish/seafood.  Recommended without any reservation!  Wummmm....</review>

I don't eat sushi so I judge a sushi place by their other offerings. Typically I will order teriyaki beef or teriyaki chicken and this place had both of course and I remember getting a plate of both and like many sushi places the meat was a little tough and not particularly amazing. The service was nice though and my lady loves the sushi here.< /text>

We've been going to Matsu Sushi for a few years now, and we've only had one delay in our food order. It was a wait of approximately 30 minutes, but they more than made it up to us. They brought us extra food and dessert, free of charge.
The food is always delicious! We usually order the Super California Roll, Titanic, miso soup, Chicken Karage, Sea Steak, and Combo Sashimi appetizer. Everything is always fresh and very tasty, we never leave a clean plate behind.
The staff, from the waiters to the sushi chef, are very friendly and helpful. They might not know us by name, but they know us by what we order! We absolutely adore Matsu Sushi!</Review>

<Name>Kalvin Lai< /Name><Text>It was gross.  We ordered the mango roll, gogo roll, superman roll, and the titanic roll and they all taste nasty or at least for the prices they were charging.  The rolls were rather soaky. The sauce they added on was like and tasted like bad imitation.

Mediocre food, mediocre service.  The caterpillar roll had the smallest sliver of Unagi in it I've ever seen.  The hibachi fish was mostly bone.  Must be because the Japanese food competition in the area is not very abundant.< /Text>

<user_name>Momo</user_name><Time>1606144914994<//Time><rate>4<//rate><text>(Translated by Google) A park of relaxation in the town. There was no trash and there were wild squirrels and rabbits. There are basketball goals, soccer, skateboarding, some playground equipment, and training playground equipment. It's a very calm and nice park. The number of benches is small. It is a compact park that you can walk around in about 30 minutes even if you walk slowly around the perimeter.

町の憩いの公園。ゴミ一つ落ちてなく、野生のリスやウサギがいました。バスケットのゴール、サッカー、スケートボード、いくつかの遊具、トレーニング遊具があります。とても落ち着く良い公園です。ベンチの数が少ないです。外周をゆっくり歩いても30分程で周れるコンパクトな公園です。<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMus35sDRT_Q8k2zSdJ0ET6z9yt19qtvIzcW-nq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7IKz7Lhi3u1mkcXbYDjp0q19xZiR-4gafEeNx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7lHVwhhTZdUpir_lECi1Yf0CAR_JLHvoaWwTm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWvz7PVKvWfHHT2PFtMv_cu3PHq32kIgzYdpoM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMX8bX3TiYA3YA_CsWUIbO9Siyc3HZQ3tR1LaU3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>So we wanted a LAF chaise and RAF couch.  When we put in the order Tim couldn’t figure out how to switch it to that, nor could anyone else in the store. When they couldn’t figure it out they told us to to have it assembled the way we want.  That didn’t sound right but I was rushed for time.  The next day I was highly suspicious that they just made that up to make a sale.  So I called customer service and they confirmed that it needs to be ordered correctly and not assembled later to specifications we needed.  They said we needed to call the store.  So I called the store number.  Well that just directed me back to the Ashley call center! And they told me to call the store!I explained to them what was happening and they would contact me later that day to confirm the change.  Guess what no one called me! So now I don’t know what I’m going to get.  I have zero confidence in The Ashley sales team and corporate doesn’t care.  I hope you have a better experience, good luck!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

A wonderful showroom where Toys R Us was for decades. Great deal and even better customer service! David Trinidad is friendly & professional. The perfect package to be in sales 👍 The manager, also named David, was very nice too. Thanks guys, we'll be back 😁<//review>

My husband and I went to Ashley on Blossom Hill on Saturday. We were attended by Tony, a kind, cordial and warm person. Tony made the task of choosing a living room set easier ... there are so many options in the store. Overall it was a great experience.< /Review>

<text>My family and I recently made our 2nd huge purchase at this store and I am nothing short of happy and satisfied!! Thanks to Gina the manager she was extremely helpful when it came to making sure my family and I left the store happy without breaking our pockets. I love that she wasn't money hungry or just trying to push a sale. She was extremely friendly and patient. As a manager she truly went above and beyond her duties.. she gave me advice on which furniture pieces would look nice that would fit my family and had a lot of patience with us. From beginning to the end she made our shopping experience so stress free and I truly appreciate that!!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

After a couple of hiccups with delivery..we were able to go into the store and talk to the Sales Manager Kip Gregson...he got our delivery issues sorted out and made us happy! Also got to see our future sofa...and still love it! Thanks Kip for taking care of it and reminding us what good customer service is all about! We'll gladly come back for future needs and pass on our great experience with you!<//Review>

Read about other negative reviews on here. I should've listen to their advice. Don't make the mistakes. Ordered 3 chairs, 2 were damaged. Getting a hold of "Customer Care" is a pain. Once you do, they won't do anything until they send a tech out. Next avaliable appointment for the tech to just look at the problem is a month from now.

Other companies would just give you a product exchange. Ashley makes you keep the damaged product and for them to come out to attempt to repair the product. I wanted new chairs, not damaged repaired chairs.

Edit 05/12/21 update:
Technician arrived to make the replacement on the barstools. When they opened the replacement seat cushions there was damaged on both of them. Noticeably large scratches on the frame of the seat.

They're ordering 2 more replacements and I have an upcoming appointment in 3 weeks from now. Hopefully those seat cushions don't arrive damage either.

More to follow..< /text>

Products are good. Service is too sloppy.
1. Ordered a dresser,mirror in store.
2. They took it to a wrong address(old one i had my last product delivered). Eventhough i had corrected the address when buying the dresser in store.
3. I took the initiative and called into dispatch/delivery to set it right as i realized from a last text message which mentioned address. All previous text alerts do no have address.
4. Now, brought to a correct address - order is wrong. They brought only dresser and i have been told this is the only one. I was advised in-store to not accept delivery if item is wrong because that is a hassle to recover from. So, i had provided info that item was wrong and so the item was taken back.
5. Its been close to a week, i have made a bunch of calls and left 2 voicemails and still yet to get my correct item.

Product number 2: Couch
1. Bought a couch with recliners/charge plugs ~40days ago.
2. Charge plugs do not work. I scheduled a service,waited for ~20days and Service that i have been provided is: Checks if the wire is plugged. and the conclusion is plug set does not work.
3. Then i have been told to wait for a week to get the replacement plugset delivered to my home and call Again to reschedule Another service to get the item installed.< /Text>

Dan Nguyen was extremely helpful. He explained every little detail of the items we were looking for to make sure we find the right ones that match our needs. He was fast and easy to do business with. In the future I will go back for any other home furniture needs. Thank you again!</text>

<Name>Jason Kopp</Name><Date>1618281597130</Date><Review>Love the couch! Don’t love the service nor the “protection plan”. Long story short, my couch was delivered with an oil stain and damage to the arm rest and it was a HUGE pain to try and get it repaired. After dozens of phone calls, emails, two store visits, three technician visits, and finally an exchange visit over the course of 15 months, the issue has been resolved. Truly some of the most frustrating and complicated customer service I have ever experienced.

Shout out to Rebecca S. from online support who FINALLY was able to book me that couch exchange appointment and get me a new couch.</Review>< gmapID>

I bought a sofa set on July 4th, was scheduled to delivered on 8/17. We understood the situation and agreed.  However, two days prior to 8/17, they called me with a new date on 8/21.  Then later another date on 9/2. On the day of 9/2, they called me saying the truck was broken down, needed to reschedule to 9/5.  Then on 9/4 they called me again said they run out of the sofa set and the earliest date was 9/12.  On 9/11 they called with to confirm 8-12pm delivery on 9/12.  Today is 9/12, nobody showed up, I called them at 1pm, they told me the shipment was cancelled and the earliest new date as of now is 10/1.   Haha, the date is moving smoothly toward the end of 2020.  I will never trust them and how they treat customers is really eye-opening, never heard of. Ashely is not trustable! To them, customers do not matter at all!</Text>< Pics>

< review>
worst customer service I had a dinning table delivered yesterday and the delivery guys didn't even wait for me to inspect the table or sign
a delivery receipt. as soon as they left I saw couple scratches and peeling wood, I called Ashleys customer service and they said I have to call the store, then called the store and was on hold for ever so I decided to drive
there instead, the guy in customer service said he will open a case to do a swap they will pickup the table and deliver a new table but he can't submit the case till tomorrow so he will call me in the morning to give me the confirmation which he never did so I called again and was told he never opened a case or started anything. now they're telling me they have
to send a tech to inspect it not just swap the tables. this is probably is going to take month to get this solved. I ordered from wayfair and overstock and their customer service is excellent and fast. never again from Ashleys.<//review>

Ashley has to have the worst delivery service ever. My dining table was set to be delivered on 11/2 and we waited all day and no table. No phone call. No email. No form of communication AT ALL to let us know why. They confirmed with my husband 4 different times that we would be home and still didn’t show up. Y’all have to work on your delivery service, cause right now it’s ridiculous.</text>

I did not receive a call or email on that update...which is extremely unprofessional. I would have been fine with the delay if they were professional enough to let me know ahead of time and not have me move my schedule around this delivery. When I try to probe to get more answers all they say is sorry I don’t know why you weren’t informed. I’m highly disappointed< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Very unsatisfied with the process of my delivery. If I could rate the company  0's stars I would. I bought my furniture well in advance since I recently moved out of San Jose and knew there were delays due to COVID. I was informed my dining set and living room set would arrive within a month after my purchase. The day before my furniture was scheduled to arrive I was giving notice that my dining table was out of stock and would received a call within 3 days after my first delivery. More than 3 days passed and I did not receive I call. I had to physical go into this store because I was  put on hold when I called the corporate number or corporate would hang up on me. When I walked into the store I was later informed the reason why my table did not make it with my first delivery date which they explained  the warehouse gave my table to another client. I have came into the store multiple times asking for updates of my delivery date because the staff in the front kept giving me different dates and they mentioned corporate would not respond to their emails. This has been so frustrating to say the least.< /Review>< user_id>

<review>Purchased furniture from this store 2 months ago. They trick customers by giving earlier delivery dates and then as you are approaching the delivery date. They call 1 or 2 days before delivery date - saying you wont get the furniture for next 2 weeks. They have already delayed my furniture by a month with no explanation on why they call 1 or 2 days before the actually delivery date.

BEYOND WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! Spent $6,000 cash and still No one has replaced my damaged headboard and it’s been over 3 months. I keep calling and asking even showing up to the store to speak to an associate or manager. Every time I show up after waiting to talk to someone usually about 30-45 minutes they tell me someone will call me to schedule a delivery. Till this day NO ONE HAS CALLED ME! I am currently at the store right now as I write this. I arrived at 2:00pm and it is now 2:30 and manager keeps telling me to wait that he’s busy helping someone.
I will NEVER recommend anyone to buy from Ashley’s furniture. I am so disappointed and it was such a horrible investment. This place is the WORST!
To top off everything no one can give me a straight answer.
I will continue waiting in hopes that someone can assist me.<//review>

<Review>I don’t usually do these, but the service we got with Chris was awesome, so I’ll keep it short & sweet.

Came in looking with my girlfriend for some new furniture for our new place. With Chris’s help we found everything we were looking for and more. He wasn’t pushy, just extremely helpful when we were ready to pick the things we wanted. He explained everything clearly & helped us get the best delivery date we could.

Overall, highly recommended experience. Thanks again Chris!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

We recently came to Ashley Furniture to purchase new furniture. Chris was the sales associate who helped us with our purchase. He was absolutely fantastic! He helped us out a great deal and put in a lot of time to help us get the best deal. He is genuinely one of the best sales associates we have come across! He is extremely friendly and very outgoing - it’s as if you’re just talking to an old friend! If you ever go to Ashley Furniture to purchase anything I 100% recommend going to Chris!</text>

Chris assisted us with our purchase and made the experience extremely smooth and quick. I like to walk into stores with an idea of what I want instead of looking around and browsing. As soon as I told him what I wanted, he went to work searching the inventory and then explaining the delivery process to me.

Chris was friendly, sharp, efficient, and got us in an out of the store in less then 30 while providing stellar customer service. I would highly recommend him to any of my friends or family. I will be returning for another purchase soon for a kitchen island and I’ll be visiting him again.< /Review>< user_name>

I have had bad experiences in the past with Ashley Furniture in Milpitas . I went to San Jose store hoping service would be better. Gina and Lia helped me with my order. Before my purchases I went back many times and they were very patient.  I purchased a couch and a dining table . I am so happy with the service and the great deal that Gina - store manager gave me . I recommend San Jose Ashley better than Milpitas.< /Text>

Everyone that works in this store has great costumer service. Specially Gina, she took the time to make sure we looked at different designs/styles before making our purchase. She was very patience and always had a smile on her face which made my family and myself feel welcomed.<//Review>

We purchased a table and 6 chairs on January 18th. They were delivered on the 23rd, and all of the chairs were unwrapped and out of the box. Each of the chairs had a defect including scraped leather seats, dings on the dark wood legs, scratches, punctures in the seats, as well as most of the chairs being wobbly. When I asked the delivery crew if I should just refuse the shipment due to the poor condition of the chairs, they instructed me that I should accept the chairs, and they would get someone out right away to replace them. I then found out that I would have to wait for a technician to come out and evaluate the chairs to see if they were eligible for replacement. There were no available technician appointments for another 2 weeks after the delivery date. I accepted the next available technician appointment, and got a call the day before to inform me of the time window. The time window was during the day, and no one would be at home, so I called to try to reschedule the appointment, and was told there was no available appointments for more than a week. I told them to keep the original appointment. They then called the next day and informed that the original appointment had been cancelled and I would have to wait another week to get someone out there. I went into the store in person and spoke with the manager, and he told me there was nothing he could do until the technician came out to look at the damaged merchandise, and at that time he would be able to replace them for me. By good fortune, the technician showed up at the originally scheduled time despite them telling me that the appointment had been canceled. The technician looked at the chairs and stated that every single one of them would need additional parts in order to repair, and that we were better off just getting new ones instead of trying to fix all six of the damaged chairs. The technician said that someone would call us within a few days to schedule the delivery of the new chairs and pick up the old ones. I then got a call from Ashley trying to schedule another technician appointment. When I called back. I was informed that the original technician said we refused to have the chairs repaired, and that they would need to send a technician out to try to repair them, even though the original technician agreed that they were to be replaced. I called back again, and after waiting on hold for 30 minutes, was told that in my account notes, the technician said that we refused repair. I tried escalating to a manager, and was told that the hold time would be 45 minutes to reach a manager. After waiting on hold more than an hour, my call was disconnected. I am so angry and frustrated right now, I plan to file a dispute with my credit card company and get my money back. Whatever you do, do not buy furniture from Ashley unless you want to be totally screwed over.

UPDATE: Two months after receiving defective merchandise and still not taken care of. Can't park in my garage due to storing merchandise for two months. No word from Ashley. This is a nightmare.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I will never buy from Ashley Furniture again.  I ordered a loveseat and table with a two week delivery date.  I received a text, email and phone call from their distribution center stating my furniture will be delivered as schedule.  On the scheduled delivery day no furniture showed up and no phone call from Ashley telling me why.  This happened two more times with their distribution center giving out delivery dates and no delivery happens.  When my items were finally delivered they delivered the wrong loveseat.  Another bad option with their distribution center is, when they call you to confirm your delivery date, if you don't answer the phone they will automatically reschedule your delivery time frame.  Then when you callback the distribution center, plan to be on hold for at least 30 minutes and once you do get someone on the line don't let them put you on hold, because you will be disconnected.  Terrible customer service.  Go to RC Willey if you can.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I purchased a counter table (Item: D154-223) and a sofa (Item: 2070238) at Ashley's Homestore (Sales order number: 180070730) in San Jose on Friday July 17,2020. The sales rep. said that we could finance the furniture and so we applied and were approved with Genesis. Because of low staff, there was no one to help us out with the paperwork for the finance and so she said that there was no way to proceed with financing because the employee who took care of customers who were approved by Genesis was on leave so we decided to pay with 2 debit cards. On one of the debit cards they charged $1,000 and on the other one they charged $256.36 which in total was $1,256.36 including delivery and taxes. She also stated that the delivery of our furniture was going to be on 8/2/2020. We changed our minds after we had paid because it was going to take 2 weeks to get the furniture and we needed it as soon as possible. On Monday July 20,2020 we personally went to the same location of our purchase to cancel our order. The lady in customer service claimed that we should be receiving our refund in 3-10 business days. As of today August 10 ,2020 , 21 days have passed and we have still not received our refund. We went to the same location of our purchase and were given three numbers to call and 2 of those numbers didn't work and the Ashely's Homestore Corporate phone number left us on hold for one hour and 23 minutes to be exact just to have no response, no date of refund or any solution. Ashley's Homestore is completely unprofessional and clearly struggles to meet customer's satisfaction.</review>

Ashley’s is one of the best places I’ve come to shop for furniture. The staff was so helpful and always on a move to help me look for what I needed. Out of all the amazing staff Dayna Chapman was our personal helping staff
Member and we couldn’t have the best set of furniture if it weren’t for her. She helped my family and I find the best ideal living room we were looking for. The assembly process was also successful they have people come in and assemble everything in your house. Definitely coming back here in the future for more furniture.< /review>

We visited Ashley's San Jose store today to look at a sofa that we saw online. We were greeted by Claudia as soon as we entered. She showed us the sofa we were considering and answered all our questions patiently. She even price matched the online price from Ashley's website. Overall, an excellent experience!< /text>

Wow, wow, Wow! What else can I say! Chris was such a great help. He knew exactly what questions to ask to help me find the perfect couch! Financing was a breeze, and I'm now the proud new owner of a top tier sectional for a fraction of the cost. What a deal, and what a great experience from an amazing salesman. Thank you again Chris for getting me the best deal possible. You rock!< /Text>

I am never ever buying from Ashley's Furniture  again. I ordered a dining room table, couch and coffee table. The first delivery everything BUT my dining room table came and we were not told in advance that we weren’t receiving it. After finally contacting someone they delivered my dining room table a week later ONLY to deliver the INCORRECT chairs. After getting transferred from warehouse to customer service to the corporate office to the store I went in to speak to a manager. The assistant manager HENRY was so RUDE yelling at me not once apologies and in turn, tells me he isn’t going to argue with me and this a 4 billion dollar company and this is how they run things. I am unable to schedule a THIRD delivery date to CORRECT THEIR MISTAKE until my pathetic $100 store credit memo gets processed. I spent over 2k on furniture and in return, I get tossed around on the phone, yelled at by the assistant manager and issued $100 store credit. AS IF I WOULD EVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN.

Blossom Hill location management is awful. The manager continued to blame his employee and tell us how he is no longer with their company as if that is any of my business and or solves my problem. Henry was completely unprofessional and rude to raise his voice at me and to use a former employee as a scapegoat.<//review>

Kabir was great at helping me find a chair to match the couch I wanted. He custom made a package to go with just what I needed with out costing me more on extra things. Definitely recommend him as a sales person. He’s patient and not pushy, which was great.<//text>

Gina G has the best customer service ever! She showed us exactly what we were looking for and was never overwhelming with pushing us to make a purchase! With that being said, we bought what we needed and we will definitely be returning to purchase more with Gina and I have already shared our experience with my family and friends and highly recommend that they go see Gina at Ashley Furniture!<//text>

Sales reps very nice, helpful. Dayna Chapman made my visits comfortable and had great insights to what I was looking for and needed in space I was shopping for. I liked the layout of your showrooms. The beautiful furniture and many choices could have made my choice difficult, but Dayna knowledge and advice made the process less difficult.< /review>

He was very knowledgeable about the beds I was looking at and he educated me on how best to make them last with my two crazy kids.

Today my fiancé and I came in to Ashley’s in search of a bedroom set for our new home. We had the pleasure of working with Mr. Chris Barry during our search for the perfect bed. Chris was very knowledgeable and had good insight to share about all of our options. Chris showed us around and gave us some specific information on a bunch of different bedroom sets and then allowed us time to walk and talk about our thoughts on each option. We ultimately picked which set we wanted and Chris made the process quick and painless! We are definitely pleased with the customer service we recieved working with Chris and will be back to Ashley’s for future purchases!!
Thank you,
April< /Review>

<Text>I came in to purchase a couch and with the help of Chris we bought an entire room. Couch, recliner, entertainment center, 2 side tables, and  a rug. When we sat and talked about our home, we added a mattress as well. Chris listened to what I needed and was able to show us several options without being pushy. The entire process was simple and now we are transforming our home to create our dream room. Thanks Chris!!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

We bought a new bed frame and mattress from Ashley almost 3 weeks ago. After waiting more than a week for the initial delivery, the bed frame they brought was damaged. The delivery person told me someone from the store would be reaching out to reschedule for a new bed frame and we would receive it within 2 days. Guess what? No one ever called to reschedule for the bed frame. I called and the manager was very rude, told me it would be another 5 days before anyone could come out, and basically berated me on the phone saying I shouldn’t trust what the delivery drivers say by the initial quote of 2 days. I paid for a product (bed frame and mattress) and a service (delivery and set up fees) and although the money was taken, Ashley still couldn’t follow through. Very disappointing. Our new bed frame was delivered finally this weekend (still 4 days after the broken frame despite much “effort” from the manager). I wish I could say the story ends here. The delivery driver drove his huge box truck into one of our trees in front of our house and caused one of the main limbs to crash into the street. He apologized and promised he would retrieve a hand saw from the warehouse and return to help cut it up for yard waste collection. Guess what? He never showed back up. I went to this Ashley store due to the good reviews on Google, but I can promise you that once they get your money they will never follow through on anything they “promise” whether it be the store manager, delivery driver, or salesperson. STEER CLEAR of this store and buy furniture elsewhere. This has been an absolute nightmare from the beginning.</Review>

The store manager, David, did not give us a clear delivery date, but said that he would try to check with the warehouse and call us within 48 hours to let us know about the delivery date. Forty-eight hours went by and we didn’t receive any call. We tried calling the store several times but they wouldn’t pick up. We then decided to go to the store and see him. When we went there, he gave us a delivery date of July 8th. July 7th came and they called us to let us know that they don’t have all the pieces except for the nightstands and a few of the bed frame components. We told them that we would accept delivery of the nightstands, and when the other pieces came, they could deliver those pieces later. They promised that they would deliver the nightstands on Wednesday, July 8th. On July 8th, the day of the delivery, they call us in the morning, and tell us that they forgot to load the nightstands into their van, and there was nothing they could do about it because the van had already left. They promised to refund our delivery fee (which they have not refunded). However, they said they would deliver them on Friday, July 10th. July 10th comes and we hear nothing from them regarding the promised delivery. We called them, and they said they hadn’t scheduled a delivery for Friday, despite promising to do so on Wednesday, July 8th. The representative we spoke to said she was confused as to why they hadn’t delivered our items yet. She told us that a delivery date had now been set for Tuesday, July 14, and she said she would follow up with us on Monday, July 13. On July 13, no one called us regarding the items, as had been promised. We again called them, and were told the delivery date for the items is now August 1st. We asked to speak to a supervisor, who said her name was Collea. When we asked her why our delivery date keeps being pushed back, she told us the delivery date was now August 1st and hung up the phone, without any other explanation. What is going on with these people? They are supposed to be professionals and all they seem to be professional about is lying! David, you should be ashamed of how you lie to your customers, along with everyone that works at Ashley Home Store!    This was the first and the last time I purchase anything from Ashley, and I will make sure all my family and friends  never buy anything from you either, so they don’t have to go through what we did!</Review>< Response>

This place is quite disappointing in is service staff. People don't seem to be bothered to pay any attention to you forget helping you with actually picking furniture. Even when it came to questions on shipping from Ashley website or buying from store.. They discouraged online. I gather they work on commissions. I would say better to go to living spaces. Night and day difference in service< /review>

Gina was great help! As a Spanish speaking family, she was a great translator and was able to help us understand the whole process and exactly what we were spending and for what! Definitely would recommend as the service was great and we found some new great couches! Thanks Gina!

First, I need to compliment UNIKE  She was extremely helpful and super patient with us-we didn't exactly know what we wanted.  She was there when we needed her, but didn't push (A Big Plus).  She was so sweet,  She deserves much praise.  Also, a shout out to David (My Birthday Bud) who was friendly and professional.  Can't say enough good things with this store.  Love the style and quality with the price!< /Text>

When I walked in they said I needed to make an appointment and asked for my number so I gave it to them. The next thing I know I’m receiving spam call after spam call! So unprofessional for a big company like this to sell my number! I might have to change my number, the spam calls won’t stop!<//review>

Chris was phenomenal! We walked into Ashley’s on a whim to see their furniture. We were not expecting to walk out with anything, but let me tell ya we walked out with a great first experience and a deal we could not refuse. We took advantage of their Black Friday deal along with their financing program; we purchased an electric reclining couch and a rustic looking tv stand. Chris went above and beyond to get us the best possible deal on the furniture and he definitely did not let us down. In the end, we walked out as two really happy customers; we will for sure be back to buy more when we start renovating our bedrooms!< /review>

This store is one of the bests furniture store I’ve been at by far. We had the best sales person too, her name is Alexandra Venegas , she was there to help us with anything we needed & knew Exactly what we were looking for.  She was very patient with us as we were walking around undeceive & wasn’t scared to share her product knowledge & ideas. Definitely ask for her ! She is the best at what she does, & she does not follow you around pressuring you. She knows exactly when to check up on you & help you when you need her ☺️ Thanks to her I will be coming back here for more 👍🏻</review>

We worked with Claudia at Ashley Homestore in San Jose. What a professional!!! I come from 35 years of corporate sales, and from my experience, Claudia is one of the Best!! Smart!! Insightful!! An advocate for her customers!! Ashley Homestore doesn’t realize how fortunate they are to have someone like Claudia working for them!! A wonderful person and truly an asset to her organization and to the customers who are fortunate enough to work with her. Thank you Claudia for all your good work!!!</text>

Tried the online experience, tried to call store directly,  spent 45 minutes waiting for anybody to answer.  Unless you walk into the store and corral a sales person, you will never get a question answered.  Just an FYI.  How important is customer service to you when you cant walk into the store.  I went locally and paid just a little more but when I had a question, they picked up the phone in 2 rings.<//Review>

<text>Came in today just looking for a desk and a tv stand for our living room and was warmly greeted by Kabir informing us of the sales in the store. After browsing for a bit we met with Chris and he explained the sales as well as the special discount going on for warranty too! Because of this we ended up getting a tv stand for our living room and bedroom, a bookshelf, a side table for our fish tank, a new table for our living room, and even treated ourselves to a great drink cart on sale! Chris was amazing helping us out with everything and we appreciate his time and patience with explaining pricing and setting up a delivery date. All the staff there was friendly too and we’re so glad this location opened up near by. Always recommend Ashley for their great service and will definitely be back for any other furniture needs! :)</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>You have to check out the new Ashley store on Blossom Hill Road in San Jose and ask for CHRIS BERRY! When I entered, I was greeted with a welcoming smile from Chris. As I meandered towards the kids furniture department it was like walking into the Houzz app with a smorgasbord of decorating ideas tailored to each room of your house. When I entered the store I was pleasantly surprised to find outdoor furniture nestled along my walk towards the kids section. Chris asked what I was looking for, took out a pad of paper and sketched my Son’s dream room taking into account what I thought would be issues decorating it. Now here’s the best part for me ... when we went to look for mattresses for my Son’s new bed, Chris asked me “How I was sleeping?” Truthfully not well. After asking me all the right questions Chris custom fit me to an adjustable temper pedic mattress which had me feeling like I was sleeping on a cloud. I can’t wait for my new sets to be delivered! The icing on the cake was that he got me into 0% financing and my payment is less than my cell phone bill. I don’t enjoy shopping, but Chris made this whole experience amazing and stress free.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808e336e87498e9d:0xdcae5d929d0a7dd2< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ashley Furniture continues to use a incompetent delivery service. We purchased furniture from the store 2 years ago. We were charged $100 for delivery. Not only did Jose fail to show up, he also failed to notify us. We waited all day. When Ashley's finally caught with him, he stated his truck broke down. We had decided never to shop at Ashley's again. Now 2 years later, we decided to give Ashley's another shot. Only to find after purchasing, Ashley's is still using the same incompetent delivery service. Again we were charged $100 for delivery, Jose again, failed to deliver our items without notification, and again stated his truck broke down. So now the issue is not Jose's incompetence, it's Ashley Furniture's failure to protect its customers. It is irresponsible for Ashley's Furniture to require us to pay for service knowing the have a history of incompetence. 2 years ago, we were promised a delivery refund which we never received. Today, we were promised the same. There is every indication this will be deja vu. While you're in the store the sales people are amazing, but receiving your furniture is a total disaster.< /text>

We bought a dining set and they didn't delivered in the day that was scheduled. Nobody even called to say they won't be delivering!!!!!! They sent a message some days before asking to confirm the delivery, I confirmed and even doing everything right they didn't delivered! Horrible experience !!!!!!! So desappointed! Customer service?

I had a great experience at Ashley's in San Jose CA. I'm so glad I was greeted by Kabir Kalkat. He did an outstanding job answering all my questions. He is a very knowledgeable young man. I highly recommend him and San Jose store. I hope his management recognize his hard work and compensate him well.<//Text>

CHECK YELP RATINGS GUYS! IT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

Horrible delivery and return service. I ordered and found a better deal then called to cancel within 2 hours of ordering. They say it is a direct ship so they can't cancel, instead they will request to cancel, and it shouldn't be a problem, asked me to call back next day to confirm. I did 2nd day and it is still pending, asking me to call again next day, the 3rd day the order started shipping(as I have UPS shipping notification turned on), I told them the order started shipping, they give me another number to call to cancel, saying it is the factory, that number redirects me back to this store, the store said no they can't do it I have to call that number - now I am in this loop instead of getting my problem resolved. I called more than 20 times and reached different people and eventually came to the shop. They said I can't return the product to the shop, it is a direct ship blablabla. Eventually I am fed up and called my credit card company to dispute the bill. 2 days later the store called us and said it is ok to return. The money is back to my card now. Would never want to shop here again.<//review>

Great service at Store level once you finish your shopping the delivery is Horrible, schedule my delivery a month later on weekend to make sure I m free to receive my items, Truck got michanical issues! Do you even believe it in a rainy day? They call and schedule for next day exact same time frame without even confirming that you are available on that time frame, I call and ask them to at least schedule it between 8 to 12 and not 12 to 4 and they just argue it's the default.  My argument is that It's not my problem, you broke the promise and I don't have to sit and not go to work because of your delivery schedule. I went to store and store manager told me that he will get back to me and it is still no update. It's been 6 hours! There were few other costumers having exact same issue with their Items at store when I was visiting.<//review>

<text>We were notified of scheduled delivery of sofa, we verified delivery and moved our furniture out to get ready.  We waited for delivery all day and it never came.  After a long time on hold we were told it had been canceled.  We got a new delivery schedule and verified that date.  We were notified the morning of the delivery date that the delivery was canceled again because sofa was damaged and no others in stock. We then found out that the earliest delivery date is a month away.  The biggest issue is total lack of communication and cooperation.</text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I just bought a sofa, a loveseat, and a table set. First off, the store manager, Henry, is the worst manager I have ever seen. We have received our orders 1 month later than what they promised. Henry’s employee promised us a store credit but he didn’t give and said I never promised. Besides, the table set quality is very bad. Finally, to be fair, sofa and loveseat quality are good but the fact that we received them very late is really annoying.< /Text>

<GmapID>0x808e336e87498e9d:0xdcae5d929d0a7dd2</GmapID><Review>Disgusted and disappointed.. until the sale was done they were extremely patient and so nice to our faces.. and we spent almost $4000 for our furniture there.. deliveries all were messed up and it’s been almost 2 months and still not completed even after 5 deliveries, bcz they bring wrong ones bcz they have forgotten to put in specs like whether it’s a 2”/5” or 9” base for the bed..we purchased our furniture on the 14th of November and still not completed. Had to visit the store more than 6 times now and all they can say is I’m sorry and let me give you some credit.. worst story is about the sofa, it’s a beautiful sofa that we got from them but since they “forgot” to include the protection plan then, now they can’t do anything about it bcz apparently it has to be done during the first 10 days, which we had no clue bcz NO ONE INFORMED US! And there response is now we can’t do anything about, I’m sorry! Worst service and customer care.. extremely extremely frustrated!< /Review><time>1577508181743</time>< rate>

<text>Do Not Buy Here, came in found what i want applied for credit and the tablet said i was approved for thousands. went to finance dept and handed me the phone  it was the banks saying i was denied. so we were walking out mad that we seen we were approved the sales lady came back and said wait then went to finance dept and told her to check the other banks and sure enough we were approved. so if you came in and was denied credit you may want to check with another store you might have been approved. Finance dept dont have a clue in this store when you run your credit it goes through multiple banks and they don't even know this just a very sad store.</text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Fully stocked but tucked into the Safeway, this location is very convenient for me.  I like putting my order in and then going to quickly shop for essentials.  With the pharmacy at the Safeway, I found myself waiting for a prescription fill once so I went and got a drink while I waited.  This location was also just remodeled, updating it's look and equipment.< /Review>

This is my go to coffee shop. It's easy to get to, has a large parking lot, and is usually a table to sit at if you need to get some work done. The staff are very friendly and courteous.</Review>

< Review>
This was the Worst Fast Food Experience ever! (I'm Black and this incident was racially charged.)
Me and my girlfriend walk in and sit down to read the menu, then IMMEDIATELY the Manager yells at us from across the room "If you're going to sit here, then go sit outside"
So I told said "Okay" and proceeded to look at the menu then she stared at us (and mind you an elderly lady walked in right before us and the manager only asked her one time if she was still looking at the menu, but the manager stared at us and asked us multiple times "Do you know what you want yet?" Clearly all of us were still looking at the menu deciding.
Now I fear SPIT or something more DISGUSTINGLY will be in my food IF I order again.

<Review>Today I visited the Del Taco in Downey, this was a desaster, the 2 Tacos ordered had hardly anything in them, little meat, little lettuce, no cheese, missing tomatoes on one. At nearly 2.00 each, I got screwed. 2 crunchtados would have been great if they were placed in the box right side up, but with the facing down, they were a mess to eat. What a wast cif time and money. This place is inconsistent and troublesome. Need to find a better Del Taco.</Review>< rate>

Went to pick up an order, and drive thru was packed, so I decided to go in. Well now I know why Drive thru is backed up. You have an employee on his phone standing next to his register. I walked in stood there for a moment. When one of the runners acknowledged me then, he turned around and put his phone away. Then once he realized I was just picking up, turned sat back down on the counter and pulled out his phone. Then I watched as another customer come in to complain and stood behind him for a bit before getting even more agitated, and have to get his attention so he can put his phone away and actually help him. So Unprofessional to be on your phone at work, and also to keep your back to the lobby when the doors are unlocked.< /review>

I prefer Del Taco over Taco Bell. Their menu is so much better, yet their prices are equal. Plus they have specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays after 3:00 PM!!< /Text>

< review>
The staff in the front tends to get my order wrong, So I don’t recommend ordering any specific burrito. I only go for the beyond avocado tacos so that way my order does not end up being messed up. Highly recommend the manager come and straighten this location out, it was better before.< /review>

Not sure what was going on will Del Taco on this day but service was super slow, took almost45 minutes to order and receive our food. Not sure what the staff was doing but you had one worker on the phone just chatting away. Then the woman at the window giving attitude because I told her we were missing a burger. She seemed frustrated, who knows if the restaurant is suffering because of poor management and staff not properly trained. I hope today was a fluke. Maybe I'll try again. No not really. Also fries were cold in the inside but warm in the outside. Got my order wrong too.< /review>

The store manager Carmen who can’t even speak English or Spanish properly is so ghetto and to top it off has a horrible arrogant attitude. She fails to understand that it is because of US !!! She has a job!

This lady has no right to mistreat and hang up on customers and insult them. We are there to pay for a service! We are not there to get free food or poor service after paying for our food.

The ladies at the swap meet are way more respectful that the trashy people they have as managers at that location. Never again!< /Review><Rate>1< /Rate><user>104252511717619520188<//user></record></dataset><record>

<Review>No seating for my weary bones in side. The quesadilla had way too much grease. And the burrito was unexpectedly very spicy. Other than that, it was fairly pleasant with the employees and we enjoyed ourselves. We found seating outside. We got to feed the birds. Birds like spicy burritos. Lol 😆 The tacos were great.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>It's not the best Del Taco I've been to, but it's still good food! I don't go through the drive thru because it's always always always busy! If you go in it's usually not too busy. Keep in mind there's only one register though. The manager is nice and the fries are always fresh! The tables are a little dirty and the floor could use a good deep cleaning but it's okay. I like coming here because they are fast and get your food to you quickly< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>The store was nice and clean. Maria at the register was quick and efficient with taking down my order accurately (the receipt said Daniela but I was just going by name tags). My burritos and tacos came out to order fast and they were delicious! Would definitely come to this Del Taco again soon 😊 Thank you guys for the great service and quality dining!</text></record>

<Date>1579982289286</Date><review>A lot of the low level, value meals lack. You have to throw down some salsa to get any zing. This chain had bland flavors and really is an overpriced rip off. Decent cheese quesadilla but for $3? I would only eat here if completely desperate or run out of napkins in my car. Close the doors.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

<Text>This young man was quite a gentleman, he took the time to walk my elderly mother into the hospital on a completely voluntary basis. He even refused to accept a tip from my mom as he could tell she's on a fixed budget. Very commendable character. Truly an asset to your organization and an exceptional work ethic.  Precisely the type of worker you should strive to retain.

So happy they have Beyond Meat!!! Also the fact that you are able to substitute it instead of regular meat on any item of the menu is amazing! I'm happy I can enjoy my macho burrito again.<//Text>

I went thru drive and the young lady was very nice , I highly recommend the cheeseburger with fries believe when I say they are better than a Mccdouble !! The cheese melts in your mouth and it tastes very different . The fries are very different from the typical fries we usually get! The noachis are delicious better than Taco Bell if we are being honest , they use American cheese rather than the yellow cheese which makes a difference<//review>

<text>I've recently became vegan, and my family loves to eat at Del Taco, so I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had an Avocado Veggie bowl. It had rice, black beans, salsa, and avocado. It's actually very delicious and I am very happy to have an option to eat at this restaurant chain.<//text>< Pictures>

I've been going there for many years, I love the turkey crispy tacos but today it was terrible!,  I ordered 3 crispy tacos, 3 were broken,  2 were missing meat  and lettuce, is the 1st time I get this garbage, they have different manager and obviously employees don't have consideration for customers and prepare the food in a very sloppy way. Shame on the manager ! I tried to call  Del Taco and the telephone line was busy forever!.  I'm so disappointed!< /review>

< Review>
This is strictly about the drive thru. Less than half the time I go through it, I'll get through like a normal drive thru would work. The majority of the time, I get a woman who holds you at the speaker to repeat herself 10 times and will tell you to "hold on", while she leaves for 5 minutes. I'm guessing she holds you at the speaker so that you're time at the window is quick. I'm guessing there's a timer inside and the faster they get you through the window, the better.

Today is pouring raining and I'm sitting at the speaker while the inside of my car is being filled with water and she keeps leaving the speaker</Review>

We are frequent customers of DT - it's location is walking distance from home & school, so the kids often grab food here. Food is tasty but still fast food. We do like that they will customize just about anything they offer, if you ask.</review>

The cheese melts in your mouth and it tastes very different . The fries are very different from the typical fries we usually get! The noachis are delicious better than Taco Bell if we are being honest , they use American cheese rather than the yellow cheese which makes a difference<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I won't be going back anytime soon. Definitely not worth the expensive price.< /review>< Pics>

When you walk in the roof is leaking water so you can only sit in half the area.  When I got my fries I found pieces of plastic in it.  They apologized and refunded me.</review>

<Review>I love their fries!  I get the kids meal for the kids and ok,  for me too.  Lol Just because it perfectly comes with everything I need... Cheese quesadilla,  crinkle cut fries,  drink,  and yeah the kids get the toy.  😁 No,  but really they are a great place.  Even gave me a yummy milk shake free on my birthday!< /Review><time>1552713103775< /time><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

I like Del Taco but today I ordered the triple chicken box and up sized the fries too a large and when I get home, which isn't close, they were the normal small size.< /Text>

Tonight was really bad which is very unusual for this location. The tostada shells where stale and nasty. The salsa that Congress on the crunchdadas tasted funny and old sorry Del Taco this is usually my favorite location but tonight was not so good<//Review>

My favorite item is the steak soft taco because the sauce they use is absolutely delicious.  No other restaurant has it or can match it.</Review>

The experience was horrible. I order food and it was WORNG... then I go back to make it over and they made it WRONG again. They don't pay attention to what they see on the screen or what they are doing!!!!! I also while standing there watched the older women working there get the order wrong while there boss was standing never. PLZ DON'T GO HERE ITS HORRIBLE. I COULD OF WENT TO MC DONALDS OR SOME WHERE ELSE IF I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE LIKE THIS. AND I NORMALLY LOVE DEL TACO I'LL GO OUT MY WAY TO LA THE. GO TO THE ONE IN DOWNEY. I'M SO MAD AND STILL HUNGRY THIS IS RIDICULOUS MONEY WAISTED AND DEFINITELY GOING IN THE TRASH!!!!!</Text>
