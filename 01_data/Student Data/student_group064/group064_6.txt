Super fun experience, good selection of drinks, and we really enjoyed the available lawn games after we got off the train.
Only reason for 4 stars is that the train just moves in a straight line forward, stops for a while to ensure you get your full time, then moves back along the same line. Would've been cool to have a loop.</review>

<Review>Really unique family attraction, my children were a bit young to enjoy some of the parks features but they did have a bounce house which was definitely a win for my 22 month old twins and my 4 year old. They also loved to look at the huge train parked out front. Hoping next time we come through it isnt quite as hot and we are earlier in the day so we can enjoy ourselves more.</Review></record>

I lucked out and ended up going twice, one week in-between visits. The weather was incredible, and I would recommend paying close attention to the forecast when you book your visit. They did a nice job communicating tips prior to arrival. However, please note if you are taking elderly folks, there is some walking on uneven ground/gravel required. As well as a hill. Also, getting into the bikeseat requires a little agility and balance.
We managed and it was a lovely trip, both times. You can get away with very little pedaling if you choose. The fellas who run the ride are patient and informative - consider  tipping in the tip jar after the ride!
Both trips (October 2020) offered complimentary bottles of water or Gatorade and hand sanitizer was available on the picnic tables. Please note there are outhouses for use and a washing station for hands but no indoor plumbing if that is a requirement of yours. The trip time was true to expected schedule, there is a basket to bungee your pack if you bring one, water bottle holders and the seats have rain holes should you ride in a shower. They run rain or shine.<//text>

What a great concept! The event and staff were well organized, friendly, and seemed to enjoy what they were doing. If you are looking for something different then the usual going to the movies, or grabbing a bite to eat, this is the place! What a fun way to spend time with your significant other and enjoy the open outdoors 😊< /review>

Fun train ride, especially if you like themed rides. This was the Great Train Robbery, complete with "money" that the bandit on board takes during the hold up. The stop for lunch was good, though hot out (is about summer here). BBQ served. If vegan or vegetarian, will need to find out if food for diet is available ahead of time. Relaxing, slower  (approx.10 mph) ride through farm land and river area.</review>

A little irritated because the weight limit is 250 pounds per rider. Yes 250 is a lot but a lot of people are a little over that weight and for a whole bike on a train track i feel it should hold a little more weight than that. Smh.</Text>

<review>We took a ride on the Christmas train yesterday. It was like an unsuccessful purchase from Aliexpress - expectations and reality did not coincide at all. The children and I were placed along the sides of an open car, not a passenger car, with the sides covered with a tarpaulin. The sides do not protect from the cold, because they have huge holes, and you will not be able to look out the window, because this part of the tarpaulin is not transparent. And I wanted to look out the window - because we spent quite a long time just on a trip without any activity from the "elves". Even without music, she wasn't playing at the time. A couple of games played by the elves were not bad, but most of the time we just didn't hear our "elf" because of the noise of the wheels and other noise, and it worked without a microphone. Heating was not carried out by the most stable and reliable structures, one of the two in our car broke down halfway, the second just loomed menacingly over the passengers, swaying when moving. My children and I were put on folding plastic chairs and my youngest daughter fell off it a couple of times. In general, if you are waiting for something like in the photo in the ad - a cozy cute wagon - do not hope. You will be carried like firewood. We also took a couple of smeared photos on the phone with Santa, without even making sure that Santa is visible in the frame. Santa is sitting behind the glass-it is clear that this is the cost of the situation, but it is not heard and he does not hear. As a result, the children said that everything is clear, it is not real. PS Two stars only for the delicious cocoa and the friendliness of most of the staff.<//review>< name>

<text>Loved the River Train ride.  Beer, wine, soda, and snacks for purchase. You pre-order sandwiches for lunch (comes with chips and cookies). Air conditioned and with toilets. Pet friendly.  30 minute stop in the middle to stretch your legs and pan for gold. Nice leisurely ride.</text>< date>

<review>I took my brother to go rail biking!! It was a lot of fun. We forgot to use the brakes and he went flying and fell on the ground. Slightly dangerous but super fun. Good experience. There are no seat belts on the bikes. Beautiful scenery of the river and the Sacramento Outdoor area! It was a bit expensive but I enjoyed it.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809ad43a83294c9b:0xaf43fad57d73efda</GmapID></record>

Do visit when you are in Sacramento. You will experience beautiful natural beauty through your journey of 2hrs 30mins. I visited with my hubby during valentines so was just an icing on cake. You would love the variety of wine kept for tasting. Do visit and have fun.< /text>

We drove up from Oakland and arrived 45 min. Staff gave us the wrong instructions and we were not called at our appointed time for the bikes. After 30 min of haggling with staff, (the general manager would not come out) we left with a refund and an offer to come back -because they could not get us on another appointment for the day, which is hard to understand, especially when I explained we had come from so far and were trying to celebrate my son’s birthday.

We spent the day on the car for nothing.  What a waste!<//Review>

<rating>4</rating><review>We were celebrating a birthday on the Beer Train. There were three craft brew tasting stations and a snack bar.  There was a live band and we were dancing. There is even a stop at a mock town for corn hole games and more dancing. The staff members were pleasant and helpful. I look forward to taking the Sacramento River Train again.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQqxMfTB5JYAFxJ6b9JXemA1wsFRJ9xJB2Jiu9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQLUCIN33QPt2HiYFHAx_1n60DiOAU2PFkLYRq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMjpUrmOMEtp6EiimCyoVwg94JL8UOGpzgSY0E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOx8Eyp8-WABmic2gsgFxAvmmWgKiufG9UaHoR8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

The rail works its way through local farmland. It's kind of neat to see it from that view.</Text>

<review>Did the Beer Train today. Very nice trip. Simple ride, about 90 minutes upriver and then 90 minutes right back again. Great drink options from local breweries (Yolo, Knee Deep, and River City today, though I understand it varies), plus some good food. I would have liked the option to get more good on board, the serving was a bit small for my taste (though I eat a lot).</review><Date>1580012192352<//Date><gmapID>0x809ad43a83294c9b:0xaf43fad57d73efda< /gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

<Review>Loved the train and the staff. The on board show was cute but it needed a little extra. Maybe some Christmas music in the background, livelier lights, a little more show, some displays?  For the price they charge per person, they can certainly afford it. I don't know their options as far as the train path but I wish it would've been longer or some nicer scenery.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x809ad43a83294c9b:0xaf43fad57d73efda<//Gmap_id></record>

If you were expecting the Polar Express experience for their Christmas Train ride, think again

Pros:
+ Check in process we very smooth and easy
+ Beautiful decorations
+ Love that we were served hot chocolate in appropriate cups with lids and drink stoppers to decrease potential spilling accidents
+ The man with guitar and kazoo and harmonica was a very good musician
+ Snowball fight in the end was extremely fun

Cons:
- It was hard to identify which tables were ours since only one table was labeled! We had 5 adults, 3 children -- It was not clear that we had a 3rd table (2 of 2 seat tables, 1 of 4 seat table), so we were squeezed in to our first 2 tables until someone corrected our seating arrangement.
- We could NOT HEAR the storyteller.. The poor lady was screaming to the top of her lungs and it was just not loud enough.
- The production was extremely sub-par for the price that we paid. I understand that we are technically not at a broadway show, but the script was extremely awkward and disorganized

Other:
* I probably would not recommend this experience to other friends an families, but in case you want to test it out for yourself, I would recommend it for families with kids age 5 or under<//Text>

<Text>This was a long anticipated trip we have wanted to ride. Unfortunately we were disappointed in the event. Our trip was after christmas so listening to christmas music wasn't what me and my family wanted to hear. The food was worth the value I got the continental package at 8.88 each. We went one time almost to woodland just shy of a mile to city limits , train stopped over the bypass and started back to west sacramento and it took close to 3 hours to creep along wich was perfect for napping. If the owners would have some one point out historical points along the way and the historical history of this track would be more enjoyable. I lived in woodland all my life and I k own about the history in our area .that others would enjoy. Example : why originally this track was laid. What this area originally looked like. All the farming and what  grow. Were the old ferry was and why we needed the ferry. About the veterans bridge on I 5 . All about the bypass and the reason why we have it. Just a few pieces of  trivia others may enjoy. You have a great idea with the train but as far as entertainment it was a good snooze.< /Text>< Pictures>

My mom treated us to a ride on the Magical Christmas Train. Our car was the best by far! The elfs were amazing and the overall experience was very good.  The hot coco was not very good but the kids will enjoy it. The beer car was open if you venture to go that route. Very worth it</review>

It was fun, but you needed to walk from one end to the other to get your tastes.   Maybe having the open air cars in the middle might be better.   We had pre-purchased the sliders, pretty good.  Snacks and wine we're available for purchase, but no change was available.   Ripoff!
With all the beer drinking and a full train one of bathrooms was down.   There was only one bathroom at the fun stop too.   Inconvenient.
Staff was great, overall it was fun, good for groups of 4-6 too</Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>Beer Train then and now. A few years ago the glasses were actually glass and about 20% larger. There was a VIP ticket that allowed you on 1 hour before the general admission. There were more beer options. There weren't any dogs on....not that I'm bothered by them, but more the owners that don't care that the dogs are blocking the already narrow passageways.
With that said, we still had a good time, the food was actually better this time and the beer was good. The sights are nice and with good friends this something to do at least once.</review>< name>

Little pricey, but we enjoyed it and it wasn't pretentious or over the top.<//review>< Pictures>

I'm a very bah humbug kinda guy, but every year I take my family on the Christmas train ride here. I have yet to be disappointed in the performances. My son loves it, the wife loves it, and I... manage. 😜

All kidding aside, it's a great experience. The seating is very comfy and cozy. The ride itself is at a sedate pace and is quite relaxing. Which is why we keep going back year after year!</review>

I took my 6 & 7 year olds on the Magical Christmas Train and they LOVED it!  We did the Polar Express last year and they both said this was significantly better in their opinion (they were very upset last year because the Polar Express folks told them that we were going to the North Pole, but when they said we'd arrived, my little ones immediately recognized there was no snow and they complained that we'd been lied to).   There are lots of fun activities for the kids and the train staff are very good at engaging everyone. I highly recommend this.</text>

Rip off!  Don't waste your money!  We had a large group who paid for a train ride & western show and THERE WAS NO SHOW!  It was a crazy expensive 2 hour train ride.  I never would have paid $65 per person if I had known there wasn't going to be a spectacular show.  We tried to get a $20 per person refund & they ended up giving us $5.  That is pathetic.  If you buy tickets to a concert & the band doesn't show up, you get a refund.  There was supposed to be a show & there was not (and they admitted there was no show), we should get a refund. Period.  They deserve zero stars, but that wasn't an option.  It is not your customers problem that you do not properly train your employees.</text>

Fun train ride that lasted over three hours. It was a bit hard to find but the directions on the site are good. The guitarist was really cool, and sampling the wine and chocolate was fun. The "meal" was not on par with the experience, it reminded me of cheap cafeteria food. It came in a thin cardboard dish and was very low quality. I am not a picky eater either.< /Review>

We love this train.  It's not the one in old Sacramento but the service is a lot better.  There are 2 locations, one across from Ikea & one in Woodland.  We go on it at least once a year.</text>

Ahmed is a true asset to this pizza hut location. He went above and beyond to make sure our experience was great! Besides the big rainy storm and busy store we were treated exceptionally! Pizza was hot and fresh and service was 5 star! We will be back! Thanks</review>

<Date>1561378557012</Date><Text>#👆 They gave us a hand tossed pizza and we paid $2 extra to have a pan style crust pizza.
#✌ they forgot to put the buttery garlic on the crust. When I called back and let the manager know he said that he was going to send a guy to my house with a stick of butter.
#✌👍 I brought the food back and he only wanted to give me half credit. And no refund back on my card & it was $43.00 btw total. And no refund!!
🔥💥 So Crazy so i called the corporate office. They said they will get my money back on my card and the next day or two. We'll see if they do what they say. Until then stay away from the Pizza Hut on 1300 East Bidwell.<//Text>< name>

<Text>Commercials online were offering a large meat lovers for $10. Website even displayed the same thing. When I placed the order online, they called me back to tell me they wouldn't honor the order unless I paid an additional $2. Apparently, they are a "franchise" and the website/commercials are wrong.

Awesome customer service over $2 and a mistake that sounds like it's your problem, not mine.<//Text><date>1578794449119< /date><Rate>1</Rate><Pictures>None</Pictures><name>Aaron Carr<//name><GmapID>0x809ae41509c1230f:0xe078e9ea59db1414</GmapID><userid>113235562606873615516</userid>< Resp>

<UserId.>115331095084403167210</UserId.><Name>John Rodriguez</Name><Review>If you are expecting a gourmet pie, go somewhere else, but if you are expecting great pizza at a great price come to Pizza Hut. I too am happy that they have finally arrived in Folsom. For much of my childhood, I ate at Pizza Hut with my family whenever there was a big game and pizza. I think if you go in expecting to have something unimaginably great, you'd be disappointed, but for a nationwide brand, Pizza Hut delivers. The staff at this Pizza Hut have been courteous and professional. If it was a toss up between Domino's, Round Table, or Mouontain Mike's I would choose Pizza Hut because I really like the way it tastes.<//Review>< response>

Better than you think! The customer service is great, and the deals are fantastic. I am so glad that we finally have a Pizza Hut in Folsom because I was having stuffed crust withdrawals. Amazing pizza at a great price, what is better than that?< /text>

<review>These guys are unbelievable! I called to place an order. I've ordered from them before so they should have my payment info on file. At any rate, they never asked for my credit card info. When the driver arrived, he told me they only take cash. This was never communicated to me by either of the people I spoke with while placing the order, neither of whom requested that I give them my credit card info. The delivery guy called the store and the manager told him that it was too late to take my credit card info and that he needed to leave and take the pizza with him! Terrible, terrible, terrible!< /review>< Pics>

We live 3.4 miles away and they will not deliver. Their range is 2.5 miles. News alert... if you want to stay in business, you will need to deliver farther then most of us in Folsom walk. 5-mile radius is the average. If they continue this rediculous delivery range, I give this place one year. FYI- if they can't drive a few miles to deliver a pizza then we will never drive there to get one.< /Review>

<text>Honestly I don’t understand how they can screw up a chain restaurant’s system but they make the worst Pizza Hut pizzas.  I have tried them on two separate occasions and they were both unacceptable (doughy sloppy messes.  Stay far far away from this location (i am an actual fan of Pizza Hut in general)<//text>< Pictures>

The store is nice and clean.  They are practicing safety guidelines. You can not try on any clothing. No refunds, you can only exchange for store credit for 30 days.</text>

<Review>Good luck if you ever need help with customer service online or Instagram. They have a bot that responds to service, it seems. They don't actually care about your concerns and just copy and paste all their responses from the website. I wish you good luck if you order from this company online. They clearly don't care about their customers. They just want your money.< /Review>< Pictures>

I recently heard about the pants from this store so I ordered them online and on my trip to LA I wanted to check out the store. 😕 The store is unkempt and doesn't keep much in stock as far as shirts go. Due to what they choose to keep in the store, it comes off as a low budget stripper attire store (the kind you find in the hood where an Asian lady pops up out of nowhere telling you to hurry up and buy). I will stick to online shopping with them. Pants fit really well if you are a small waist/big booty girl.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I went in to fashion nova store in Burbank ,Ca  on 2/7/21 at3:56pm  to return items that I ordered online . When I arrived to enter the store the front entrance was blocked off an associate came to entrance and questioned me about having COVID -19 symptoms which I cleared all questions.. the woman associate then proceeded to tell me that I could not enter the store because of the mask that I had on.. there was no sign posted or presented to me that would say or that was stated by the company that only certain masks are permitted in the fashion nova stores. I explained to the woman associate at the door that I traveled far to return items. The associate then states to me do I have another mask I replied no . She then goes on to say that fashion nova has strict policies about facial masks but there was no sign or paper work stating certain mask are only permitted.. she goes on to say that she’ll let me in this time. I arrive at the counter and was greeted by sales associate iris aguilar who assisted me with my return. She was very pleasant and helpful with my concerns about not being able to enter store. I was not able to return a dress I purchased because of COVID-19. Fashion nova should state on web site  when ordering that certain items  are not able to be returned in store due to COVID-19. I am very displeased with the service of the front entrance associate and the lack of  information that is not provided to customers during this pandemic about returns.<//Review>

<Text>Do not order from this place. They ripped off my 14 year old daughter of her Christmas money. Told her they would not refund her order that she never received.  They also did the same to my older daughter. Scam! Sad that they rip off children too!</Text><Date>1611619145237<//Date></record>

Usually I have great experiences with fashion nova but this rims I needed my order quickly so I paid for expedited shipping,...needless to say, it came on the regular announced day that was listed before expedited shipping was purchased. I’m very disappointed.  Of course, the phone number does me no good to call due to temporary closure with COVID-19 so my money is basically lost in the wind. I order from fashion nova at least 4 times a month but I’m so upset about this I think I’m going to shop elsewhere that honors their offers for expedited shipping...< /text>

<Review>Don’t shop here if you actually ever want to receive what you paid for. I’ve reached out MULTIPLE TIMES and no response. NONEXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE I guess once fashion nova got big they stopped caring about sending out actual orders. Will be spreading the word.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2955ab6cc5113:0xdafff3a09c59fd95< /Gmap_id>< username>

<Text>I am quite dissatisfied with Fashion Nova. I bought Jeans that were way too big. The sizes on the website did not match the jeans that were sent. I went in store to exchange the Jeans that were sent for a size that would fit me, but was unable to as the item was a final sale. The manager Dolly was very short with me and not personable at all. It was almost as if she didn't want to be bothered. Not the best example of customer service. She didn't crack a smile not once. I've worked in the service energy before and my encounter at Fashion Nova wouldn't rate above a 1 star. Do better! You never know the company you may be entertaining. No solution was made to remedy the mistake and I'm stuck with jeans that don't fit.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><rating>1< /rating>< username>

<text>I ordered from their online store. Clothes are not the best quality and their return policy is horrible. You will only receive store credit even if they screw up your order and you have to pay for your own return. Makes no sense. I will never order from them again. I used their return system and my returned items are currently lost. I feel like I just got robbed.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2955ab6cc5113:0xdafff3a09c59fd95< /Gmap_id><date>1574455144069</date>< pictures>

This store has been remodeled and is poppin! I walked in and was immediately greeted. Still a little small but had a good amount of inventory. I was hoping they carried their curve line in this store but they do not unfortunately. If you’re in the area check it out!<//Review>

The delivery business they use is very unprofessional the wait time to speak to them is nearly 2 hours and they are even having a hard time preparing my packages for me to pick up. I sought help from Fashion Nova customer service and explained the issue and the women brushed it off and just said the package is on it's way when it shows that my package is delayed and has been for multiple days. Needed my order for pictures this weekend and now I have to spend more money elsewhere in order to have something to wear for my shoot.</Review>< Rate>

Completely fraudulent business practices. A fraudulent charge was placed on my account from this company (I.E. an online order I did not make) in the form of a significant amount. My financial institution instructed me to contact Fashion Nova directly to resolve the issue while the transaction was "pending." The company refused to void or even investigate the transaction , and I was hung up on twice while attempting to resolve the issue. Fashion Nova told me to "refuse the packages for a store credit." Fun fact, the packages are not even going to my address. Definitely a predatory company, absolutely avoid Fashion Nova.<//review>

<Text>Shopping for a wedding gift is hard, shopping for a wedding gift last minute is even harder. I went to Fashion Nova and was helped by Karla who made it a lot easier. Her friendliness and respect is something I have not seen or experienced before. She gave me suggestions and opinion of certain clothing pieces I was considering on buying. Overall, I left with 2 full bags ( One for the bride and one for myself) I am extremely satisfied with her costumer service and will definitely go back. If you guys go shop there make sure to ask for her YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.</Text>< pictures>

Rocio at Burbank was helpful and explained the new store policy, having great customer service.

Although, I am upset with Fashion Nova new return Dress policy, you can no longer make a dress exchange if you made your purchase online.<//text>

If you order fashion nova clothing online, than it's highly likely that you're going to receive  clothes that run too small or too big. If you live in LA, instead of shipping iy clothing back, just return it to the nearest fashion nova store. They will take it back and give you a store credit. Which is great!! The girls at checkout are super sweet and very helpful.< /Text>

< Review>
The manager is a rude lady. Honestly. I was trying to return some clothes that I bought online for an invent and those came 2 weeks late. She was rude. All I wanted to do was get some store credit, so I could purchase something else, hell no! She was not trying to help at all, just gave me an attitude like I was stealing from her or something. She deserves to be unemployed forever. Bet she is salty bc she is unhappy in life or something. Not the person you want to represent your location. Customer service is awful, other employees even said sorry to me because of how she acted. Hilarious how mad and rude people could be for no reason.<//Review>

<review>You guys must be the company with the worse service ever! You forgot to the enter the entire address to my order so now it has been sent back to you guys but since you do not have a 1800 number and take 6 days to reply to emails I cannot get to the bottom of the issue..But let me guess you will offer me a coupon but not include the shipping I paid. So if I do use it I will end up paying again for shipping again.. Mark my words!< /review>< Date>

Great service and awesome lady's giving informative feedback. I really dislike the online ordering system.  Lady's you cannot use your gift card here, although they took for ever shipping it. It's not 2 business days it's 10 or more. Then they tell you that one or more items are not available. They tell you that a few days after your purchase.< /text>

Their selection is good and has their more popular items rather than the more technical things that you'll see on the website. Only two things that really weren't to my liking, 1 was that the mall itself is going under construction so the back wall is just a curtain and also the store took us a moment to find , 2 f you never have heard of the brand before you than you'd think it is more of a low budget party/trashy store but if you do know what to look for than it is great. Other than that great experience and the fit is great. Their clothing is good for small waist but thicker thighs and bigger booty people.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Ordered a dress from fashion nova and wanted to exchange it here. Found out they don’t carry plus sizes in their stores. Really sad that they are excluding so many people even though they offer plus sizes online.< /Review></record>

<UserId.>101356773390824351638<//UserId.><text>Visiting America for the first time, ordered some clothes with 1 day delivery. Got refunded the next day without any explanation so I asked and ordered again. The second time I couldn’t find my order and apparently it didn’t go through. Ordered for the third time now and paid for 1 day shipping + Saturday shipping. 24 hrs later and my order still hasn’t been found so now I’ve been here for almost two weeks, leaving soon and spent my shopping money already with nothing to wear. Will not recommend this site to my friends at home</text></record>

SCAM SCAM SCAM ALMOST 5000 COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST FASHION NOVA ON BBB ( BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ) More than a month and still no shipping. The customer service is as useless as ejection seats on a helicopter. Disgusted by this company. Don't expect to be able to comunicate via email or phone call with a human being. Who knows if I will ever see my money back or the clothes I ordered. SCAM SCAM SCAM SCAM<//Review>

<Rate>2</Rate><Text>The two stars are for the customer service. The young lady who helped me was very nice. I would give zero Stars if if I could due to the merchandise in the store. It is a total cheaply-made joke! The music was too loud and some of the customers were downright evil. You can walk into any of those fast fashion, merch- made-in-China  stores and buy better quality things. The things that were of a slightly better quality were way way WAYmore expensive. Save. Your. Money!</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
My fìance placed an order online. It became lost in transit and fashion nova offered no type of resolution nor refund nor alternative. No store credit nor replacement pair of jeans. There is no one to call or talk to over the phone. They told her it was between her (my fìance) and usps. However, THEY (fashion nova) chose to ship usps. Usps is THEIR carrier of choice. Customer satisfaction should come first. Online businesses should be prepared to replace merchandise that is lost in transit and sort the rest out with the carrier. Bottom line...</Review>

I don't know about the others, but the clothes and fashion pieces I have received looks very good. My party dress, in particular, came from here and I have received a lot of compliments that made me feel good and flattered.<//text>

<Review>If you live close enough to come to the store, don’t. They have the same thing at Santee Alley / Fashion Distrcit for like 10$ instead of 30/40 .. the jeans we all love are from a brand / warehouse called vibrant so if you see vibrant jeans for the low, cop them! Same exact brand, different label / marketing.. you’re welcome! -@AshleyMarietta

Ps.. they have a HORRIBLE return policy which they don’t inform you of before you buy.. if you buy in store, you can’t get your money back and you can’t get store credit for online use soooo don’t impulse buy like I did lol, they hold on to those coins for dear life 😂< /Review>< Rate>

Don't buy at Fashion Nova!!!
It has been 19 days that I placed an order online (9702817) to be delivered in US and it has not been shipped yet. Moreover, Fashion Nova customer service (Geraldo Lanza, Nikki and Hedy Moscoso) are trained to copy and paste email templates with excuses and reply to customers. They don't care about your email and issues. They are not able to provide a solution. All they say is "hey nova babe, XOXO and other non-sense things". I have sent a Better Business Bureau complaint and a lawyer letter asking for my full refund in my credit card + fees. If you don't want to have this headache; don't buy at Fashion Nova.< /Text>

<text>DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!

Customer service is SO BAD. SO SO SO SO bad. Maybe the worst I've encountered.

They ran out of stock (I GUESS?) of an item I ordered but instead of a refund decided to send me store credit- NOT OK.

The pants I ordered are not the size listed, at all, remotely. At least 3 or 4 sizes smaller than they state.

Very upset that I wasted my money at this store just because of some stupid IG hype. Don't believe what you see on social media.< /text>< Response>

< Review>
They fixed up the edges of my front teeth really well and did a cleaning. My teeth look and feel better! They answered any questions I had and gave good recommendations. Later had to go in for some fillings, which I was very nervous about. They numbed my mouth well and made sure the fillings were right. Even fit me in when I’ve had issues with my teeth. The doctors and staff are brilliant and kind! Glad I found a great dental practice! Love them! Worth going to!<//Review>

I had my first appointment today with Dr Low, I am so happy with the office staff, Miguel the technician and Dr Low.

I have had some concerns with my teeth since my life long dentist retired, Dr Low Informed me that my teeth were in good shape ( they are 51 years old) and some minor work needs to be done, a retreat on a root canal and I am good to go.

Thank you for keeping my faith in good dentists< /text>

Listen let's be honest nobody enjoys going to the dentist but unless you want to be toothless we go.  I have had nothing but positive treatment at La Mesa Dental.  The staff really listens to your concerns and acts accordingly.  I would highly recommend La Mesa Dental.<//review>

<Review>It was my first time going to La Mesa Dental. Things went pretty well until an assistant kept pressuring me for my phone number. I think his name was Miguel. Anyway, he wouldn't take no for an answer and I felt that part was unprofessional. Everything else went fine.< /Review>< Pics>

Dr. Low is so incredibly knowledgeable and discusses all the potential treatment options in very simple ways that make it easy for you to understand. He is very patient, and you can tell he cares about his patients and really wants to help make their lives/teeth better! His office staff have been very friendly and take every precaution to keep patients and staff safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. I also had the opportunity to see Dr. Vu for a filling and she did an excellent job and was so talented and friendly. The office has all sorts of new equipment and you can tell that the doctors are very up to date on their dental knowledge and advancements in their field. Overall, I am so incredibly pleased to be a patient at La Mesa Dental. Dr. Low and his staff go above and beyond to take care of patients and he is one of the best doctors I have encountered!<//review>< name>

During this time of COVID19 it is especially important to know that your dental office is following COVID guidelines.  I felt comfortable and safe with the check-in procedure and impressed with the steps that are taken for each patient.  Air conditioning filtration, UV lights and disinfecting before next patient. In addition Sarah did a great job of cleaning my teeth.  I was very comfortable going to the dentist. I highly recommend La Mesa Dental.< /Review>

This is a great dental office. They are very efficient. They have upped their game for the Covid. The person that worked with me was very friendly and made me feel comfortable. I’ve been going here for years, and have always had a good experience.  My former dentist retired several years ago. This was a single dentist and hygienist in one office. Although it was nice to have that personal touch, I like the flexibility of this company. I would recommend La Mesa Dental.<//review>

COVID countermeasures definitely something I haven't experienced since the start of all looming doom. Not particularly scared of COVID but, if you are go here. Your safety, along with the staffs is many levels above what I would consider "safe". With that said, getting in and out is not an issue either, very thorough, fast and effective dentistry for the modern pace in spite of current situations with or without. Longtime patient, highly recommend, satisfied, happy mouth big smiles.< /Text>

This place came recommended from family, and I was blown away! Incredibly welcoming and competent staff, clean facilities, and a well-rehearsed COVID protocol - La Mesa Dental exceeded all expectations.

I've been to other dental practices where they aggressively upsell patients on extra procedures or supplies. The staff here are very clear with explaining what's going on in X-rays and models...and they'll mention problem areas to watch, but wont push you on unnecessary expenditures.

Dr. Low and Sarah (dental hygienist) were clear, concise, and so pleasant. Can't recommend coming here enough!< /review>

Really like La Mesa Dental.  They know their way through insurances so they tell you with precision what your insurance pays and what’s out of pocket. Their customer service is also great as well as their dental work. I specially like Sarah who is a dental hygienist. She does incredible work with little to no pain and has an awesome personality.</Text>

Dr. Low, Vasana and everyone I've met at La Mesa Dental are wonderful. There is a very positive & caring atmosphere in this busy dental office. They don't try to push unnecessary tests, procedures or products on you ,which I appreciate. I would highly recommend this practice. They also have a lot of variety in their appointment schedule for those who like to come as early as 7am or as late as 4pm.<//review>

Everyone in this office is very friendly and helpful. I have worked with several hygienist and they all are great. I have been seeing Dr. Vu for several years now and she is top notch. I absolutely love her and her assistant Claudia. They take very good care of me and my family. Dr. Craft is very caring and professional.< /review>

I (used to) HATE the dentist. (yup, all caps and bold if I could do that here).

..that is, until about an hour ago.

I wish I had gotten the names of everyone I encountered at this office because they're truly exceptional.

Dr. Low is as honest as it gets.

Other dentists have (rather strongly) suggested an expensive "all on 4" surgery.

Dr. Low has recommended a different path that will dramatically save me money.

He could have easily agreed with the others opinions and made a fair amount of money taking their share in the process.

Thank you for being honest Dr. Low!

Next up.. lets talk teeth cleaning. If you hate teeth cleanings you likely haven't had one from Estella. Estella is hyper aware of everything going on and makes you feel comfortable at all times.

I can't thank the staff of La Mesa Dental anymore. You're all amazing, see ya soon.< /review>

<Text>I love this office!  Dr. Low is so friendly and puts you at ease.  He’s very kind and straightforward and explains everything so you understand what needs to be done and your options.  The office staff are very friendly.  I recently moved out of the area and I have no plans of changing dentists.  I love this place so much, I’ll sit in traffic and drive the opposite direction than I need to go for work, just to keep them as my dental care providers.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80d9571f67be4129:0x46ad4ebc275047e3</GmapID></record>

My family has been going to La Mesa Dental for over 25 years.  We have watch their business grow.  Their professionalism as well as a close bond with each patient remains the same.  The quality of workmanship is aboveboard.  They provide an high-quality staff and excel in preventative care.
I have recommended La Mesa Dental to several of my friends and am happy to say they are still patients to this day. (~10 years)

We appreciate a dental group we can trust in all aspects of our dental care.< /text>

I love this dental office! Sara was my hygentist today and she was so patient with me and my anxiety over being there. She explained everything she was going to do before she did it and took plenty of breaks. I felt comfortable and much more relaxed than I was walking in. The office staff is incredibly friendly! The dentists are so nice here. My whole family goes here and they love it too!!< /Text>

La Mesa Dental and Dr Vu are amazing. They got me in for an emergency as a new patient and for someone who is deathly afraid of the dentist, I will never feel that way again. I can’t say enough good things about Dr Vu and Dr Low. Not to mention Dr Vu’s dental assistant Ciladki (sp?). The entire team, front desk and even the business office mgr, Anissa were amazing. Thanks La Mesa Dental. You all are top notch and set a very high bar and a standard of excellence for Dental practices everywhere.

Much Gratitude and Appreciation

Awesome admin staff, high tech cutting edge equipment and methodology. Ann was super friendly and knowledgeable, she gave me a painless yet thorough teeth cleaning. Dr. Low gave me a pain free crown, and made the final crown product same visit instead of putting in a temp and having me come back again like I've been used to at other dentists, which is unheard of. I've been to many dentists in my life but this group is tops by far. Highly recommended.< /text>

<text>It was a great experience.  I went in thinking I was going to get a tooth pulled because I couldn't afford a crown for it.  Instead, the dentist saved my tooth my drilling out the decay, which was extensive, and filling the tooth.  I'm very happy with the results.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><time>1472673404184</time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Since broken teeth are never planned, I was glad to have been a current patient of La Mesa Dental.
Over the holiday weekend I sheered off a crown, and LMD was able to see me right away Monday morninng. They evaluated my situation, gave me options and then between scheduled customers, they performed the root canal expertly. I was out the door at noon with a new crown. I'm so thankful to the very professional and caring staff at La Mesa Dental. A shout-out to Dr Vu and Claudia!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>La Mesa Dental is a great place, both for adults and children. I feel no need to bring my kids to a special kid's dentist. The appointments are always thorough and efficient and the staff is very friendly. I didn't even have an appointment for my son yesterday (I was at an appointment myself) and they squeezed my son in so they could look at a problem in his gum (in spite of being extremely busy). Thanks!<//Review>< Pics>

Is it possible to have fun at the dentist? I'm here to tell you it can be. The La Mesa Dental Group is without a doubt, the best dental group I have ever been to. I started going there back in 2009. Since then the office and staff have been reliably helpful, happy, and pleasant...each and every visit!

You can tell when go to a place if people like their job. Are they genuinely happy and eager to help? Or are they frowning and reluctant to acknowledge you? At La Mesa Dental Group, it's all smiles (pun intended). Seriously, it must be a great place to work for because all the staff are so nice!

OK, so here is the best part...Dr. Rob Low. He is a great dentist with a great sense of humor. I'm not sure if he is like this with all his patients, but he has me cracking up all the time. Don't get me wrong, while he is drilling he is professional and all business....but during exams he can be a hoot to listen to.

So yeah, I'm a big fan of this place. I never thought I'd ever be so happy with a dentist. I used to fear the dentist! Going to La Mesa Dental Group makes the pain of a dental visit much more bearable.</Text>

This was my first visit to this office and I am happy to say that I found everyone very friendly, helpful anf professional.  More importantly,  I met two other patients in the waiting area who had both been coming here a  long time and they both expressed extremely positive views of this practice.<//Text>

<name>B. Hobbs< /name><review>La Mesa Dental ... you'll find consummate professionals here. Friendly and courteous along with sincere caring for your dental needs. I had a crown fall out that needed some TLC and that could hopefully be reattached. I made an appointment online thru their website the night before requesting a scheduled appointment two days later since this was late evening making the contact. I received a call the next morning and was seen that same day. The crown was re-cemented and i was good to go in no time at all. An expert opinion / diagnosis and care plan was given to me to later engage a more longer lasting remedy / repair for my marginalized tooth. As an added blessing, the charge to re-cement the crown and quote for the remedy repair to extend the life of the affected tooth were joyously affordable. Much much love to all at La Mesa Dental...you guys are best!< /review><Gmap_id>0x80d9571f67be4129:0x46ad4ebc275047e3< /Gmap_id><rating>5<//rating></record>

I've been going to La Mesa Dental for 7+ years now. The staff I interact with have always been very nice, helpful and accommodating. This is the only dentist office my son has been to as well, and I am so glad we found this dental office. I always know we're in good hands when we come in for our bi-annual visits, and occasional fillings. :) Excellent Dental Office!<//Text>

We had great service from the first phone call to arrange the  appointments.  The office staff is friendly and helpful and there were several options available for times and dates.  My sons first visit to a dentist and he felt comfortable enough to tell me to wait outside in the waiting room while the hygenist checked his teeth.  The only issue here is the parking lot is a bit small so if you go at a busy time you may have to park on the street and might be difficult to get a space close by.  Great visit!<//text>

I was in excruciating pain and called for an appointment.  Less than two hours later, I was in the dental chair having a root canal. I am so pleased that I don't have to spend my weekend in pain.

Dr. Low even contacted me in the evening to make sure I was okay.

La Mesa Dental is highly recommended by me!< /text>

Really happy I decided to go here. It had been a long time since I went to the dentist and was nervous. They were very professional and understanding. I need some work done and feel good about getting it done here. Dr. Vu is very professional and explaines everything and she made sure I understood the procedure. Price wise everything is broken down for you and they also show you what the max would be if insurance will not cover you.

I had a cleaning done too. It had been awhile, so I was expecting it to hurt but it wasn’t bad at all. The tech (sorry forgot his name and feel bad about it) put me at ease. Very gentle and despite having some sensitivity it was not bad at all.<//text>

Usually my visits  at La Mesa Dental go very well Without any problems so I am really surprised at my experience during my last visit on this past Monday the 24th.  I went in for a regular scheduled cleaning and had someone whom I had never had clean my teeth before and she just ripped at my gums with that dam hook ! It was like she had very little training! It wasn't just a couple of times it was over and over and over again! I was so relived when she forgot to check my gums to see if they where receding.

Dr.Campanella is absolutely amazing in articulating your condition as well as different courses of treatment with his opinion as to the best one for your situation.  I took his advice and am thoroughly happy with the results thus far, which were different than a previous dentist I saw for the first opinion.  Anisse is EXCELLENT at informing you as to what these procedures entail per your insurance and what out-of-pocket financial obligation you might expect to see.  Thanks La Mesa Dental for your help!<//review>

He is very conservative about treatment and will try to solve your problem with the least invasive method, while keeping expectations realistic. He obviously has his patients' best interests at heart.

My only complaint is that Dr. Low and his staff are way too happy. There shouldn't be laughter at a dentist's office! It should be quiet, like a funeral parlor. Then it wouldn't feel so weird to look forward to going there.<//Text><name>aletabird<//name></record></dataset><record>

I am so lucky to have you guys looking out for me. Their teamwork was like poetry and their kindness and attention to my needs upheld all the standards of your office and all of your people.

< Review>
Had a raging toothache all weekend that was managed by regular tylenol, called Monday morning, saw me couple of hours after I called, immediately detected a root canal scenario, made an immediate appointment for me with an endodontist for a root canal consult & verification, and was able to schedule the procedure later that afternoon.  Been going to La Mesa Dental for years & dentists & staff are always extremely nice, cooperative to your needs & desires & super helpful in cases of emergency like I had.  I highly recommend this dentistry.< /Review>

<text>I’ve been going to this location for my dental and family for over 12 years. Dr Low is very friendly, easy to talk to and exceptional dentist to me and my family. Year after year, I have nothing but good things to say about this office. I live by Rancho Bernardo and I don’t mind driving the long way to visit them. Also, I have been seeing Sara the hygienist  for years ( not sure if I spelled her name it correctly 😬). Ok I have to be honest aside from Dr Low, she is the other reason I go there with a happy face. She’s detailed, makes you comfortable and also friendly. Sara you’re awesome and thank you so much for my cleanings 😆 you rock.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80d9571f67be4129:0x46ad4ebc275047e3<//gmapID></record>

Drs. Low and Vu and the entire team are great. The level of efficiency, solid customer service, friendly smiles and helpful hands could not be counted. They make what could be unpleasant or even dreadful a positive experience.< /Text>

Amazing dentist! I had some previous bad experiences and was really hesitant to go to the dentist, but Dr. Low and his staff were so great! I was putting off having a crown done because of the price I had been quoted by other places, but Dr. Low did a porcelain crown for like 1/6th of the cost that my last dentist quoted! the crown was pain free and I didn't have to do a temporary crown and come back 2 times - they made the crown on the same trip. BEST part was that I didn't have to do those horrible mold impressions! ICK, Dr. Low just takes a photo of your tooth with a camera on a wand and then "prints" the crown with like a 3D printer sort of. :)<//Review>

<review>I came in for two things: a checkup and to address some severe tooth pain. I moved a year ago and needed to get established somewhere. Unfortunately they only addressed my tooth pain. They just took one X-ray and referred me to an Endodontics. Now I have to set up another appointment for the checkup which is kind of annoying. Other than the miscommunication about my first appointment, I had a good experience. I'll come back. The staff was friendly and the office was very clean.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Time>1468349296979</Time>< GmapID>

<text>I asked for a tire and they gave me one worst then the one I had. When I questioned it the owner said that was the best he could. Gave me 10 dollars back like that was supposed to make it right. The tire they put on my van is horrible. Look for yourself. My "old tires" look way better than what he put on. I will never come back. Ever.<//text>< pictures>

Had a slow leak in the rear tire.  Was able to drive in and tire repaired for only $15 and within 15 minutes.  Customer service great.  Facility looks old and dirty, but you got hard working guys not trying to take advantage of customers.  Recommend this place for quick, reliable tire service.<//Text>

These guys took last minute care of my cargo van today, after a flat tire developed during my business trip. Good advice, quick service, and inexpensive. Thanks!<//text>

The owner lied and overcharged me. Replaced my almost new front struts that were lowriders with some old rusty ones that were more bouncy.... not what I asked for. And since he made me pay in advance for the parts he didn't give me a choice to refuse .  Charged 80 each struts (rusty old ones) and 80 each for service.  Total of 320 for putting garbage on my car.
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone for mechanical professionalism... maybe only for simple tire jobs...<//text>

The gas is a little higher than most but they have a full mechanic shop here for auto repairs they are the only gas station that has full service gas. The auto shop is honest and knowledgable not a rip off! I think they do smogs as well . very nice gas station< /review>

Thanks to the gasoline boy for being speedy and attentive. This gas station must be known by many because they had very competent staff. Keep up the good service!  You must be rated 5 stars!<//text>

I guess i probably wont get gas here again when i can get it way cheaper at am pm or even mobile gas station. It was kinda messy with junk cars out in the parking lot. If you dont mind paying 8 to 10 cents more per gallon then you might like this place.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80db1b686c097303:0x7f47b79a4cdeb527</gmap_id><UserId.>116446598736953620875<//UserId.>< Time>

Service personnel are willing, however, Owner is NOT customer friendly!
I pulled in, filled up my gas tank ($65) and ask if the man on duty could please check the air in my tires....that's all...
The Attendant's reply was, "no I can not, my boss won't let me".  He stated that his boss, the Owner, Mike Diab sent him homw without pay when he tried to help someone....

This is the SECOND time for me, the last time was two years ago...and I stayed away...until today, but I came back to see if things had changed and they have not.

I believe this Owner is working on GOING OUT OF BUSINESS...because, as most of us know, the best way to KEEP business and BUILD a business is through CUSTOMER SERVICE. NOT negativity.

P.S. This was not the first Attendant who told me his Boss/Owner told him NOT to service his customers.<//Text>

Great experience with this shop.  They are honest, thorough, and explain their estimates fully.  I have complete trust in these guys and when needed I will only take my car back to them.  Thank you Michael!</Review>

I took my car in for what was supposed to be a simple repair, and was surprised how high the bill was.  I asked him how he arrived at that figure, and he said, "the computer".  Then I asked him to show me "the computer", which he did.  And the computer showed less time to do the work than I was charged for.  In other words, I was charged more than it should have been.  I'm never going to return to this place again!<//text>

I go in to buy effects and parts as well as other gear they usually have what I need and If it isn't in the store they will gladly order it for you if you can't get it yourself online. very friendly staff. A basic understanding of musical instruments and gear is recommended to get the most out of this type of store. It's guitar center but on a small scale as guitar center is the parent company of music and arts. If you need recommendations for gear the staff will recommend things to get you playing; as walking in you will likely be overwhelming If you go in not knowing what you want.<//Review>

Great customer service and friendly staff. Fair prices for being one of the few local music shops that are still in business. I've been a customer of Clark's for most of my life and I only ever go over the hill to San Diego if there is something I really need that he cant get. With his recent additions of Marshall and Eden amps, I'm finding fewer reasons to go to San Diego.< /review>

< review>
I used to go to the same place to get my windows tinted for years but I came across Autoskinz because of their ability to offer ceramic tint. From the first time I called them to me picking up my car after the job was done - everything was great. I love that they offer text reminders and updates when your car is done and everything was complete without any hassle. Idk about anyone else but I hate the feeling of getting “sold to” with these types of things. In the past I’ve gone to shops with a price in mind only for the person behind the counter to question why I don’t get more or upgrade - this didn’t happen here. This was so quick and easy at this place. I recommend them to anyone and if I may suggest, spend a little extra and go with the ceramic tint.< /review>

They do fantastic work. They tinted my windows and I am having them wrap my grill, where the chrome, is to black it out so it will match the rest of my vehicle.<//text>

I can’t say enough amazing things about AutoSkinz. Kelly is awesome and always takes care of me. Just recently brought in 2 cars and couldn’t be happier! Just scheduled another appointment for paint protection! Look no further than Autoskinz!< /text>

Autoskinz took care of my 2020 BloodStang. I had them wrap my roof and smoked tint my rear lights and side Mark's. It came out great. The pricing is very reasonable. The ladies at the front desks are very knowledgeable and helpful dealing with my car. I highly recommend Autoskinz to take care of your next upgrade mod on your car.<//Text>

<text>Best place in SoCal to get windows tint, vehicle wrap, paint correction, paint protection film and ceramic coating.
Small company of best in class artisans, simply put, if you want the absolute best results then this should be your go-to place.
Everyone I spoke with were super nice and punctual, setting up my appointment was a breeze, the entire visit took exactly as long as they estimated and the results are phenomenal.
Doesn't matter if you are driving a Dodge Ram, BMW, Tesla or a brand new Lamborghini, Autoskinz will treat you like an absolute VIP and you would be amazed at their results.

5/5 for quality, timely turnaround and professionalism!

(attached photo of a cool car they worked on the day of my visit, also seen that day a bunch of Tesla Model S/3, Dodge RAM, KIA Stinger and Lamborghini Aventador)<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMd6y2JIvAE1xxrJQm9FCMdq7_gjWRn7SL79SI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM79j78ZPVHZ1og8oDQcvGKLTI1Ee-W1unWUNY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

<Text>I’ve used black diamond tint for my last 11 cars.  They didn’t happen to be open on a Monday and I needed my new bmw done today, Monday!  Autoskinz was just as good as black diamond AND they were less expensive!  I recommend them and black diamond too, equally professional it’s just a matter of price!

<text>I have brought 2 cars in for tint, paint correction and Feynlab's ceramic coating, both look phenomenal. One is gray and the other is black so they're not the easiest colors to work with either.

It has been over a year since the gray one was treated and it looks as good as the day I picked her up from Autoskinz. We just had the black car done in December and it looks amazing. No swirls or blemishes and the shine is awesome. There is one spot where the coating isn't as smooth as it could be but I have no doubt Daniel will fix this when I bring it in.

I can't speak for anyone else but... these are some of the nicest people I have ever dealt with and they are more than willing to go the extra mile to make sure you're a happy, satisfied customer. I'm very happy with the level of quality Autoskinz provides, and I will be bringing all my future cars to them.<//text><user>113104503363404287958< /user><rating>5</rating>< Pics>

Very dissappointed with Kelly and after sales service. Clearly, customer satisfaction is not their thing. After spending about $6,000 on a PPF on my brand new Porsche 718 ($1,350.00)and a whole car wrap and tint job on my 07'BMW wagon ($4,400.00) I got a very disrespectful tone of explanation on why I had BUBBLES on my rear window. Something that they would resolve if I was willing to pay them again?? So customers beware, AUTOSKINZ will not stand by their work if you are not happy and happen to complain about it. The owner himself, GREG is a nice guy but I think he should do something about his crew, like hiring someone with good customer service skills. Just ordered my Tesla and will be taking it somewhere else for PPF.< /Text>

Update: been about 6 months or so since my review. 4 visits across 2 vehicles, from window tinting to wrapping, and everything I said still holds true, except my first sentence. It’s not ‘probably’ the best, it simply IS the best.

This shop is probably one of the best around.

(Note: the shop isn’t hidden and it’s easy to see from the street, but the entrance is a little funky to find. Waze did not know how to get to the entrance.  It will say the location is on Newhall Ranch rd, but the entrance is not. You’ll want to turn onto Avenue Tibbits, and then it will be the first entrance on your left into the large business building)

From driving up right away I knew that the quality of work would be fantastic. They have a large building, with 2 floors and offer a very wide selection of detailing products, wheels, wraps, tints, etc. in their lobby/store.

They have a nice lounge area if you intend on waiting around if you’re doing a small job, or if you don’t want to wait around, they will offer you their loaner car for free (just have to provide a credit card for liability) which is a Tesla Model 3. The loaner car made this really nice, even though I was only having my front windows tint matched and it was a short appointment.

Their receptionist is wonderful, and she was unbelievably helpful and cheery, and knows just as much about the services and products as the guys doing the job. In small words, she’s not just a receptionist. She knows her stuff. She helped me pick out the best tint to put on my car to match the existing back windows that came with the car when I got it, so that way the colors wouldn’t be weird.

Pricing is good too. Not cheap, but not expensive either.  They are very fair. I paid $120 for my front windows to be matched.

I’ll definitely be coming here again. My fiancé’s lease is ending very soon, and we’re going to be getting a new car that will need some nice new shades, and we’re excited to come back here.< /Text>

Beware if you have any issue with the job they did they will say excuses after excuses and there’s nothing they could do... unless i pay for them to fix what they didn’t do right in the first place!</Review>

<Review>Buyer beware if you have factory installed rear window tint or your car has had tint installed on it prior to you buying it in the back windows and you come to this place to try to get your front windows tinted don't expect them to make a good judgment on what tint matches the best do not expect the "professionals" to make a good judgment on what tint matches the best because they will just try to upsell you and get you to pay for the highest priced tint. I  made the mistake of trusting these "professionals" on installing 100$+ worth of tint on JUST the two windows in the front and my car turned out terrible.  I didn't care about how much heat is reflected I just wanted to match the back windows.  The technician recommended the middle grade and he did not sample it next to my back window. I trusted him and well look at the pictures, but wait theres more I also spoke with their car detailer guy and asked him what he recommended to keep my car clean he recommended a couple of products which I bought with and used with deionized water like he said and the products were terrible worse car cleaning products ive ever had the displeasure of using,  I got my car tinted on a gloomy day so I couldn't tell in the Sun how the tint looked but it looks terrible (pictures below) but  wait there's more when I went in to complain, the lady in the front desk named Shawna agreed that the tint did not match and the car looked terrible but refused to work with me to get it fixed and done right. This place seemed like it was a professional business but it turns out it's just a mom-and-pop looking to make money with zero care towards customer service there's no such thing as trusting the technician they leaned on their customer merchant agreement saying "oh no you signed" which as a business owner i know only money hungry business do and they dont try to make it right. Look at the pictures for reference terrible terrible terrible!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Greg Wilkinson and his team did an AMAZING job! I could not be more impressed with the job they did on my Tesla. From Kelly at the front desk, to all the guys in the shop, their level of professionalism, attention to detail, and customer service is top notch. They provide a slew of services. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!<//Review>< pictures>

We have sent this same quote to thousands of customers. I recommend you contact our manufacturers Feynlab, Optimum, or Shine Supply directly and they will confirm our pricing is set correctly based on our authorized dealer agreement. Also feel free to swing by the shop and I can personally go over what goes into a service like this.

<resp>None<//resp><Text>Great customer service and very professionals. They offer a range of services like paint protection film, ceramic coatings and detail jobs. They have a bunch of car care products and tools for pro detailers and DIY people. Also they offer tint jobs from your basic tint all the way to the top of the line ceramic tint to help with infrared heat that comes through into your car. Especially important if you have leather seats.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c27dde2e255357:0xaa1b34fb7b1bf2c8<//Gmap_id>< time>

By far the best window tint company in Santa Clarita. Its difficult to find a company to trust your car with and these guys I totally trust.  Window tint still looks new 1.5 years later.< /Text>

What a great place!  I had the headlights restored on my wife’s 2007 Pilot and they look new.  I had bought a kit and tried to do it myself…what a waste of time and money.  I spent 45 minutes on the headlights to get them only slightly less yellow.  In 20 minutes they had them crystal clear.  But, the “must see” photo is of the reflection off of the hood of my 2004 Accord.  They detailed it inside and out, even cleaning the engine.  The paint looks and feels like glass.  They even cleaned the inside of the rims.  The rims looked amazing and squeaked when I rubbed them with my finger.  To top it all off, they pulled out Q-tips and toothpicks to detail the interior of my car.  The result was nothing less than perfection.  Nobody would ever guess that my car was 10 years old.  It looks like it belongs in a showroom.  Thank you Autoskinz, I LOVE my new car!</text>

I went in for a simple helmet design for my racecar helmet. Sounds simple enough right. I have had to call this company several times trying to get this project done. Kept giving me the run around. I went in on 7/28/2018 and still haven’t received artwork or anything and it’s 8/23/18.

So I call again today, to see if I can get this done. Front reception lady is very rude and unprofessional, argued with me like it’s my fault they haven’t even tried to start my project. They don’t value their customers at all. Wouldn’t recommend this company.< /text>

I had one of those horror story shady "bargin" Xpel installs that Greg often refers to on one of my vehicles.  I needed to get it fixed, and that is how I met Shonna and Greg. My 370Z is vehicle number two that the Autoskinz team have done a full Xpel Ultimate, 3M Crystalline, and Opticoat installation on. Their meticulous attention to detail, like disassembling the car to fully wrap the edges, and most important to me, awesome post install customer service, is the reason why I keep coming back!  Keep up the great work!< /text>

Autoskinz is absolutely the best place to take your ride. Greg, Shonna, and Jake treat your car like it's their own. I felt like family while I was there. The waiting room is fantastic and comfy. They even offered me a loaner car to run around in while they did the work. I had my Mazda 3 tinted with Llumar CTX. It looks amazing. Flawless install. I don't know why you would go any place else.</review>

Found Autokinsz a couple of months ago and decided to contact them. I emailed them for some estimates and Jake and Greg responded back in less than a day. I even got responses back from them on non-business hours.

Took my vehicle in just for a Hand Wash and checked out their new location. Shonna and Jake were at the front desk and I filled out a check-in sheet. They asked me if I wanted a loaner car. Really? A loaner car just for a hand wash? That is so awesome! I politely declined the loaner as I told them I would just wait for it.

While I waited, I talked to Shonna about the products they use, about 3M window tint, and got some estimates from her. She explained to me the difference between the FX Premium, Color Stable, and Crystalline films. Just a FYI, the Crystalline film is the top of the line so it'll be more expensive than FX and Color Stable films.

The Hand Wash took longer than anticipated but that was because they were going over the car multiple times to make sure it was clean so this shows they pay attention to detail. Even though my car currently does not have the best paint finish, it looked so much cleaner than going to a fast car wash place. The wheels were very clean with no brake dust on the face of the rim. They even used tire dressing that had a matte finish and not that super glossy finish that can sling all over the side of the rear bumper.

Customer service was spot on which is why I'm giving AutoSkinz 5-Stars on this review. Jake and Shonna were awesome to talk to and answered all my questions and I appreciate their awesome service.<//Text>

{'time': 1595827519396, 'text': 'John, this was done in July 2019 which was a year ago. I recall you had a deep scratch in your tail gate that was too deep to correct and that was explained to you. I also recall you got keyed after our service and half that actually healed down your door. We did offer for you to come back in to address any issue that would be resolvable but you refused. Paint correction can’t always get every single scratch out. Some are simply too deep and we only have so much clear coat to work with. Removing too much clear coat will cause failure if we were to do so. It’s called RID’s (Random Isolated Defect). Once a surrounding area is corrected the remaining scratch that is too deep remains and will stand out more since the surrounding area has none. Your vehicle was corrected to 99%. This was explained prior and post our service. We even have you sign our agreement explaining RID’s prior to work being performed. We can’t fix unrepairable damage. Only a body shop can do that. I have pics and video of your project and it looked great. I would be proud to show that result to anyone. Sorry you were unhappy.  Anyone wants to see the great results you can find it on IG here: https://instagram.com/p/B0q7eSwpPVB/'}</resp>

<Text>Great service. Great food. Excellent atmosphere.   This is a place to have a quiet dinner with service that is top flight... they can guide you on wine paring and also guide you to a first class dinner... a little pricey,  but not out of line for a high class restaurant.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Review>This place is great and the ambiance is awesome. Live music and delicious bites, make this a fun place to be. With the many seating options, a pool table and a great bar, this place has everything needed for a great date night out. Highly recommend this place.<//Review></record>

<Review>Now this is good customer service. I'm a repeat customer here which speaks of their good food quality. However, during today's visit, Katie was such a sweet and attentive waitress, I had to update my review. All the male waiters have always been extremely kind and helpful. The women were just bland. That has changed for sure. And the food is great as always. Two thumbs up, Sake Sushi!</Review>< username>

<text>Jen is my god and I worship the ground that she walks on. The tower of nachos is my holy ground where I congregate to pray to the higher power of cocktails.

I would die for this land. I have forfeited my life for a higher living. Praise be to Jen.

The garlic fries were a little too garlic-y but still pretty good.

The shrimp sliders were DELECTABLE</text></record></dataset><record>

I had a group of friends from out of the area and they wanted a local place with good drinks and good prices.  Yelp lead me here.  I remembered the place from working nearby, and we were no disappointed.  Reasonable prices, two pool tables, and absolutely NO attitude. We will be back for sure.< /Review>

This is hands down the best Mexican food spot and totally worth the 2 hour wait haha. The prices are reasonable and the portions are big, definitely shareable. I love the fajitas here and they come with rice, beans and tortilla and of course all their unlimited Ever .<//Review>

< Review>
Cool little bar that came recommended from a bartender @ The Douglass Room - apparently his cousin runs this place. We managed to get seats at a little table by the bar, and someone dropped off a menu. I got Masterstroke ($13), which has rum, umeshu plum liqueur, celery shrub, and gold leaf. I was excited about the gold leaf but it was more like tiny gold dust on the surface of the cocktail lol. Anyways, it was good nonetheless. I like the intimate vibe but I can see how it could easily become overcrowded during prime times.</Review>

This place is so cute! The decor is very modern and clean. The lighting in the rooms are great, and easily turned off by closing the windows. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They all seem to like their jobs which is always reassuring. The room it self was very clean. The shower was amazing! Wish I had one in my own home. The theme of the hotel is positivity, which is always appreciated. Iv stayed here twice and would highly recommend it anyone. I'm already planning my next Long Beach stay!</Text>

The ultimate business idea: find what people liked as kids and mix it with unlimited amounts of booze. Thus Brewcade was born. Craft beer + arcade games = what can go wrong?!</text>

So this is my second time visiting and this time I got salsa from the bar lol I didn't realize they had a self serving salsa bar the first time I visited and I was curious why the place was called "Ever Bar" yet there was no salsa being served! First timers make sure to check out the salsa bar!

Food was great, service was great and will be returning again soon (:<//review>

Pretty cool bar that feels like a vampire hang out spot. Immediately after entering, I felt the need to drink blood so I ordered a vodka cranberry. Just in case you are human, there is a guy right outside who smokes ribs at a decent price.<//Text>

I'm a regular of Ever Bar. Great lunch specials. Love the salad and egg roll. They serve up one of my favorite types of curries. Excellent pad see ew :)
larb salad is tasty, just say not too spicy if you cannot take the heat.

I would give it 5 stars if they would increase their portions. If you want bigger portions, go to Saladang on Fair Oaks in Pasadena.< /review>

Came here for my friend's birthday and its as delicious. It is better than Porto Alegre and just a little more expensive. They have a wide variety of meats (I do not eat beef so this is a plus) and a little buffet bar with some entrees and appetizers. It is more upscale but you do not have to dress up. Casual dining is accepted. It is hidden away in a little plaza upstairs.

Right across the street from SomiSomi (Japanese Taiyaki ice cream) so you can get dessert afterwards.< /Text>

There is an indoor and outdoor eating area.  The outdoor is fully tented which is aesthetically pleasing because you get the outdoor experience without having your hair blowing in your face and no flies fighting to taste your food selection!

I love Nitecap!  All their cocktails are great and its nice seeing the bartenders concocting your drink right in front of you at the bar.  The ambiance is awesome, dimly lit, candles, good music ... the place overall is small but that doesn't bother me.  Awesome bar, great cocktails, will be back!<//review>

Cool little place to enjoy the sun on a nice day! The drinks are great - not too strong. I wasn't able to try the food as I only came for the drinks. In certain places the sun can be overpowering but in other places the sun and shade sits just right. It's a casual comfortable place. I would recommend!< /review>

Great new(er) spot in the mission. My boyfriend and I live close by and finally had the chance to check it out last weekend. The building is historic which was cool, still keeping some of its roots. The atmosphere was laid back and the cocktails were excellent, although they did manage to screw up a dirty martini. Overall had a great time and can't wait to go back.</Review>

Nice quiet little spot. Prices are pretty good. Layout of the place is a little weird, but the fireplace is nice, warm and toasty. I like the jukebox the most. Very modern, it's like a giant Ipod mounted on the wall.<//Review>

We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted with bad vibes, staff seemed unwelcoming and judgmental. Servers had no interest in engaging in conversations with customers at the bar, and chatted loudly amongst themselves which made it very uncomfortable for us. Never had an experience like this at a hotel lounge before, but otherwise they served good quality cocktails and the lounge is beautifully decorated.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bf38cd582ad5:0x27035c2cbe70963a</gmap_id>< Date>

Cool spot to come chill with friends and have some drinks. Its in Bernal Heights, a safe neighborhood in Los Angeles. There's plenty of seating if you're coming with a group and they have a cocktail menu if you want to try something different. Has a hipster vibe to it and I dig it. I will definitely come back when I want to come relax and have a few drinks.</Text>

Oh the beauty that is Ever Bar. This is a review for the Miracle at the Everly pop up Christmas bar!

My friends were super excited to check this place out when we first heard about it.  This place was open on Christmas Day!  The easiest way to park is just to have the hotel valet your car.  Parking is $10 for three hours. This is whether or not you actually do end up staying the entire three hours.

When we first stepped it, which is just a few steps to the left upon entering the hotel, we saw all the lights.  The bar area is so beautiful with the Christmas lights and the Santa covered chairs.  They have an assortment of decorations for you to take pictures in front of.  Additionally, they have a variety of drinks you can order.  I ordered the Christmapolitan drink, but opted to get it without the alcohol.  They were able to accommodate that and make me a wonderful drink.  They also had some games you can play to pass the time and use up close to the 3 hours you paid for parking.

If you get the chance, please visit this pop up bar before they potentially move somewhere else!<//Text>

Located across the street from the Standard Downtown, Library Bar has a "speakeasy" vibe with its dark woods and hand-crafted cocktail drinks.
Definitely a different vibe from the Standard which is more "flashy" and loud.  The vibe at Library Bar is more laid back and chill.</Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Love this place. Strong drinks, reasonable prices, good crowd and atmosphere. It's a little loud, so not the greatest place to have conversations unless you want to yell, but good to just unwind with a few friends. It's usually decently crowded no matter what the day but the bartender is always attentive. There's only one stall in the women's bathroom and that sucks, but at least it's always stocked with TP.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I have always had a good experience here, and am comfortable it will remain excellent. Reading some of the complaints that a few disgruntled customers made, I had to roll my eyes. Most of them are looking for a professional salon-style experience, but want to pay the dirt-cheap prices of a school.

It's good to see the vast majority of customers are satisfied. DON'T pay attention to those who complain without merit. I am a repeat customer because it's a great deal, and I am helping students advance toward getting their license.< /Text>

<text>So I went to get my Haircut by one of the Female cosmetologists and wooow, she did an amazing job and she was hot too. I spoke to one of the instructors there and she told me the long process they go through. This school definitely makes true cosmetology and Barber professionals. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. I'd definitely go back and reccomend this school.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp><pics>None< /pics>< name>

The most recent, was over an hour, while the students are goofing off in the back, an instructor could easily reverse this, or at best they shouldn't charge for the DMV-haircut experience. To avoid this, go to the following (Abba)School that charges the same, at: 8428 Van Nuys Blvd, Panorama City, CA 91402, you get off on Roscoe or Chase. It's in front of the Panorama Mall.<//Review>< pics>

< review>
Very apprehensive at first but I’m on a strict budget and my hair grows fast so didn’t mind. I have yet to leave feeling like I’ve made a poor decision.

Most of the students already have barber and salon experience so it’s a very inexpensive great haircut. The staff are quick to swoop in if a learning student is struggling but after 6 months of coming here it’s only happened once. And I still left with a great haircut. All the other students just ask questions so the cut takes a little more time, which I don’t mind. I like the attention and the attention to detail. All the barbers I’ve met there are real cool too!!</review>

I know it is a place were they practice and learn and that is fine
My haircut it was ok
But it took hour and half to do it, and like I said it is fine
Then I had paid to be shaved
He should said I have never done this before
But he tried with the blade and a cold towel..
He did not finish and actually cut my face like 7 times and my face feels swollen lol.

So basically tell your customers it is your first time shaving to avoid the use of the blade.</Review>

<Text>Horrible place to be
Uneducated disrespectful jerks!
I went to go get a cut for my son
All of them refused in front of me acting like it's a burden
Extremely disrespectful
Had me waiting for 20 min because people refused and a lot of spots were open
This is why they're in school to learn about this and practice
What the hell are they there for if when they work at a beauty salon or barber they will get kids
Ridiculous!
I'm very un happy with the experience< /Text>< Pictures>

Store is okay.  But food is very good. Isn't that busy during weekend. They also serve beer. Very good and recommend veggie burrito and potato taco. Overall very good food.</Text>

Great food and service! There was a small line today due to Lent season , but it moved quickly. Just a reminder, if you called in your order, you still have to stand in line. They make your order when you get there.</Text>

This places has the best fish tacos around town.  The place has a classic feel to a taco diner. They have many selections to choose from and the drink menu is decent. I come here  on a weekly base and I can never get tired of it. Stop on by and enjoy your fish tacos.</review>

<Review>Honestly my favorite fish taco place in southern california. I grew up eating here and their tacos are simply the best. All other places I've tried taste too "fake" for a lack of better term, but their tacos are very homely and delicious. 😋< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>First time here, pleasantly surprised. Got take out 2 taco combos- carne asada and el pastor, taquitos and chicken burrito. Be aware it is rated B, but we took our chances. Food was good and service fast.< /Text>< pictures>

<rate>1</rate><Text>Came here and to be honest it was the worst service ever. Not only was there pitchers disgusting and watered down on the michiladas but the waitresses there are not with the business. Not attentive at all. Asked numerous times for napkins from our waitress and other waitresses and literally until we started getting upset they finally brought some which took over 20 minutes. Like come on I would have brought my own in this case. It wasn't just us that were upset it was another table upset too. Like wow these waitresses must hate their job. Came on Wednesday. If I'm paying im sorry I don't have time for attitude or someone acting like they don't want to be there.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80dd2d3b8bb47031:0x1741a4241dc9c820</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Delicious food....made to order. Air conditioned. VERY affordable, bring the neighbors, family & friends. I like the Jamaica Drink, it's refreshing. The atmosphere is NOT fancy...but savor the tastes and smells here...go for the food. Mondays & Wed you get a fish taco for a buck. Can you beat that? NO YOU CAN'T.</text>

<Review>It's a great place to get fish and shrimp tacos and burritos. But sometimes it depends when you go because sometimes they burn the fried fish and it doesn't taste as good. But when your hungry everything taste good. You should differently try it. I recommend the fish tacos.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

A hole in the wall taco shop that specializes in Senor Baja style fish tacos. Don't let the rough exterior keep you away from enjoying what's offered here. The ceviche here is also good. If you are looking for cheap eats, the fish tacos are on sale Mondays and Wednesdays.<//Text>

Well if you've been here then you know.  Nothing to brag about but not a place to take your date.    My favorite is taco dorado with shredded beef.... Others are great too. My favorite local place to go either to eat there or to go.< /review>

Place always gets my order wrong. 3 times I've asked and paid for bacon on my double bacon cheese burger and even asked to confirm my order before I pay and they assured me that it had bacon. That's the last time I'll be going there.< /Text>

I highly recommend this place!
Please try tacos de papa! They are amazing!
The shrimp cocktail had so much shrimp omg!!(i think is the most expensive of the menu, but its worth it)
Very happy with the place and staff. Honeatly didnt expected to be that good. They surprised me. They charge 50 c per refill  and the place seems to need some cleaning. Everything seems old from outside and inside.
I will come back again give it a try.< /review>

The food here is great and authentic! Fish tacos are to die for. I like to call my order in ahead of time for fast service. If you call in they let you cut the line to pay! Nice perk!</Review>

store is small and so is the parking lot but the home made style mexican food is fairly good.  Mainly a seafood spot but they do offer other protein options for those who don't feel like seafood.  Prices reasonable too.</review>

<Text>They advertise that they have taco Tuesday deals, which is great because they are expensive here. But, sadly, as you get here and ask what the specials are... You end up just getting their head shook at you.. Not even a verbal answer... Just some employee shaking his head rudely as you ask. False advertisement here, rude service, seating is lacking and the place is small. I won't be returning..  Which is sad because their menu, as expensive as it is, sounded pretty interesting.<//Text>< pictures>

They have the BEST SHRIMP TACOS. The flavor of the shrimp blends well with the crema which is also fantastic.  Thursdays are  the discounted days.</review>

Food is good and prices are good as well the only down side is its a pretty small place. But you can always take it to go.<//Text>

My company goes to this place just about every Wednesday and today we got a bad batch of Fish Tacos. Couple of my coworkers ate the fish taco and immediately became ill. We went back to get a refund or another entree. The manager there gave a big fuse and refused to give us a refund. We asked for a different entree and that too he complained about. I guess being a regular doesn't matter to him. I don't plan to go there any more.</text>

<Review>I had shrimp & fish ceviche, it was great! Huge portions, I was full after one but couldn't  resist and had some of the second tostada. My husband had the fish tacos and he loved them, he did say that he would request extra crispy next time.  The kids liked the quesadillas with beans and rice. Came here on Friday at 5ish, it was kind of empty.. Will definitely come again!< /Review><Date>1501292335206<//Date>< gmapID>

<Text>People often come up to me on the street & you know what they tell me?

"Hey Rodney, nice ass!"  No.

"Hey Rodney, how much?"  No.  Okay, sometimes.......;p

No, people say to me "Hey Rodney, why are you so happy?", to which I reply "I just got some hot tongue action, that's why!"

Senor Baja hit me debajo de cinturon, "below the belt", with the portion-size of their lengua burrito.
A hefty tongue burrito, with rice, beans, onions, cilantro and other goodies.  Only things missing were some guacamole & sour cream.  Otherwise, a fine filling meal for $5.99 plus tax.

Senor Baja is a closet Sauce Nazi, as they are stingy with their chili sauces.  They only give you 2 containers to put their chili in if you're ordering to-go.

Various specials are offered throughout the week, such as $1 fish tacos/Mon & Wed.

Ample booth seating, with banda music for your listening pleasure.  Parking is in private lots on both sides of the restaurant.  Senor Baja is an unpretentious, hole in the wall taqueria.  So, don't come in expecting ambiance for your first date.  You probably won't get a second one ;p

As for my lengua burrito, I enjoyed it.  The burrito was filling, didn't hurt the wallet and was a healthier choice than buying a McRib at McDonald's.  I'm purposefully avoiding it at all costs.  I used to love McRibs, but knowing all the unhealthy junk that's put in it, I'll pass.

I'll be back on a future Mon or Wed to try Senor Baja's famed fish tacos.  Also, their shrimp cocktail for $10+ definitely piqued my interest.

(Translated by Google) Rich tacos
The attention a bit unpleasant, they need to be more helpful because in the end you are paying for a service, I give it this rating because the fish tacos are wonderful, one of the few places where you can find something of this style at a price accessible.
Only the detail of the attention would improve.

(Original)
Ricos tacos
La atención un poco desagradable, les hace falta ser mas serviciales pues al final estas pagando por un servicio, le doy esta calificación porque los tacos de pezcado son una maravilla, de los pocos lugares en los que puedes encontrar algo de este estilo a un precio accesible.
Solo el detalle de la atención mejoraria.</review>
