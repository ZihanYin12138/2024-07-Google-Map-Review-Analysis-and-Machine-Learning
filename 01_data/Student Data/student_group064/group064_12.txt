The best things in life always survive, including Atami Sushi.  We have been going to Atami since 1999, and this family run business continues to maintain high quality delicious sushi with a friendly comfortable atmosphere.  Michelle and Wiley always make you feel welcome when you arrive and they remember your favorite selections.  The sushi is always fresh, the service is quick, and Michelle always keeps the restaurant extremely clean.  They have had a tough time fighting through the Covid shutdowns, so if you are in the neighborhood and want some great sushi in a cozy and friendly restaurant, you should stop on by and pay them a visit.  Also, this is a rarity in SF, but they have several parking spots for those coming from farther away.<//text>

Just adding a couple pictures.
I've been here probably 20+ times over the past 5 years and the quality is 10 out of 10 every single time.
Perhaps they have some days when food takes longer to reach your table but that's because it's a little owners run restaurant.
There aren't many places left where food is prepared and served by its owners.
This place delivers quality every.single.time.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjL72knPqR0GA7TCKAOrcQXxE8FRrcb0HQ8mGH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxIhBrPia9O4l4SdiU8hqw2amM1zsAQMk2yNdG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

Must go with friends or friend or significant other! Such a cool vibe and SUPER yummy options to share!

Perfect balance of chilled fresh fish, and nice warm rice wrapped in a crunchy sheet of seaweed! I love everything they have to offer on their menu! I can't wait to go back!</Text>

<Text>This is a great experience, a bar type setting you can stand in line for a few minutes and be seated for freshly rolled sushi. The pre-selected menu offers 5 rolls at $17.50 which is extremely worth it. I had yellowtail, salmon, blue crab, lobster and scallop. I would go back in a heart beat. Great service and the best sushi I've ever had.<//Text>< Pictures>

I know, I know, everyone has their own "best sushi" spot in the city. But THIS is truly the best sushi spot in the city. Great spot for locals and tourist. Hint: don't forget to order items off the white board, especially the Red Devil roll. 🍣<//Review>

<Text>My favorite restaurant on the planet. I have eaten here with friends and family at least 50 times and always had an excellent experience. This is a small family owned restaurant with amazing and authentic Japanese sushi. Yes, the portions are on the smaller site but the quality of the ingredients and the love of the owners for their customers more than makes up for this.
On some nights the service can be slow but just bring time and you won't be disappointed. This restaurant is all about taste and flavor, unlike so many Bay Area restaurants that sell mediocre food in a hipster ambiance for the same price.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808580dc6e49ad11:0x60e45ffb6f3910a1<//GmapID></record>

<text>The best nigiri in SF! The chef really has an eye for picking out great fish. It’s a family run spot, and Michelle the waitress is the sweetest. I’ve been coming here forever and bring everyone that visits. Try the Blue Hawaii roll, Stripe Jack nigiri, and of course Sake nigiri that goes down like butter.
For those saying it’s slow, it’s made to order, don’t rush perfection.< /text>< Resp>

I've avoided this joint for so long because I just didn't think that sushi and burgers go together. Eventually, this joint was featured in Buzzfeed and it piqued my interest. It still took a couple of months before committing to coming here.< /Review>

A small intimate spot, tiny sushi bar and a handful of tables. Staff always seems to be family/owner type. Sometimes service is slow but as long as you have drinks already who cares. A wonderful place to go and talk, drink and eat sushi. On the less expensive side of SF sushi pricing.< /text>

Great local place that’s quiet and with excellent service. Best sushi I’ve had in the US. Fish is of excellent quality. Only thing I’d ding them on is that the spider roll I had was only average, but nigri was all excellent. Also note that at least when I went there they didn’t open the door until 5:05 and didn’t serve food until 530, but I had no where to go so it worked for me. If you’re in a rush I’d order for take out instead<//review>

<review>Food excellent. Service leaves something to be desired. Edamame well salted. Shrimp tempura roll was warm from the fryer. Delicious ratio of ingredients. Sashimi was fresh tasting. Soft shell crab was delightful.< /review>< pics>

I agree with Ian H: great sushi without the obnoxious scene.  The restaurant is set back from Lombard Street, behind a little stone garden and, while not ornately  decorated, is quiet and clean.  Service can be a little leisurely (usually because Michelle, an owner, is the only one serving tables) but the food is great.  The fish is quite fresh: sashimi pieces are smaller than you see at most restaurants but it's good stuff.  I don't usually order rolls when eating sushi but Atami's rolls use interesting fish (say no to Alaskan Rolls of salmon and cream cheese!) and are presented nicely.  Great sushi restaurant in a neighborhood of hits and (mostly) misses.</Text>

Wonderful, fresh fish, and a cozy setting make this a perfect place to grab a roll or two on a foggy SF evening. Service was a bit on the slow side, but it is a family run operation and the quality more than makes up for it!<//text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Exceptional sushi and sashimi. We talked to the waitress for a long time. Exquisite person. From the outside it is not as beautiful and extraordinary as it seems. Miso soup to try.

Three small things can make this place better. 1. Cabbage 2. Better seating 3. More friendly staff Besides that this is absolutely the best tasting authentic Mexican food in town. Highly recommend, carnitas tacos smack! The absolute best salsa.  Definitely a family favorite</Text>

<text>I had the lunch special. Because it's Lent, I decided to try the Chile Relleno. I judge a restaurant by their rice...Alfonso's didn't have any flavor, and the rice wasn't fluffy. The beans were runny, not like the kind I'm used to making. But, I guess when you're selling for the masses, quality doesn't matter.  What I really liked was the nopal salad. This was good,  except for the chiles japones that I took out. This is my first time, but I will come back and try a burrito. The Chile Relleno was stuffed with a cheese that could have been melted a little more, too firm. Although, maybe that's how this place makes them, al gusto de ellos.  Gracias. They do give  you plenty of tortillas.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Usually food is good my family and I have been coming here for years although we won't be going here anymore. BAD COSTUMER SERVICE! The girl was extremely rude and not friendly AT ALL.  I also work is sales and I understand how busy and how overwhelming  it can get but you have NO right to be rude to your costumers just because you can not handle the pressure.<//Review>

<Review>If I could give LESS stars I would. Normally we like the food. My husband is having surgery tomorrow so he can not eat after a certain time. He was craving some tacos, so I went by to pick up tacos. We are at the end of our funds, as his medical had taken a toll. Having about $75 bucks in the account for travel to UCSF tomorrow I thought we could spare about $10 for lunch today. Well first the card machine was glitching so the cashier kept taking my chip card in and out of the machine. Then she said it was declined. I pulled up my bank app and they had charged my card until my account was negative. The owner came up and was like, well those charges will fall off in a few days!! I was shocked!! I do not have a few days, i told him that was all the gas money we had!! I was crying and called my bank, and he said the merchant could clear the holds, but my bank could not do anything until they posted. I asked the owner to please clear the holds, he said they will fall off eventually! I explained my situation and he could care less. To boot, they would not even give me the food unless they ran my card again, the card that has no funds available due to the repeated charges!!! They said this happened 3 times today! I am upset, they have put me in a situation to beg for gas money, all for a few tacos. Oh and she even had over charged me for 10 tacos when it was 6 too top it all off! I will never go back, RUDE and unprofessional. As an owner if I cause someone so much distress over a damn $7.50 transaction, I would have called my card company and given my customer the food! NEVER again!!</Review>< time>

My family and I have been coming here for YEARS and I can honestly say, they hands down have the best barbacoa & carnitas. Although I will add that somedays their carnitas will taste VERY salty or underseasoned. Today though, they were both very very good.

I have never tried their asada, so I bought a single asada taco and was not a fan at all....it tasted like boiled meat. I don't know how to describe it but if you are looking for amazing asada tacos, this isn't the place to get them. I also ordered to go cups of rice and beans and I was horribly disgusted. The beans and rice both lacked flavor and tasted so so burnt from being in the metal cambros under the heat lamps. The rice was very dry as well and you could see grains of rice that were indeed blackish brown from being burnt to the sides of the pan. The beans also were sitting in there so long that a thick layer was dried on the cambro. Not a good taste at all.

I did order the meat, tortillas & drinks in one transaction and forgot to get the beans and rice and sent my husband. The first cashier was very nice but left on break and the second cashier was very dry and rude. Alfonso's needs to step up the customer service...it's not okay to behave that way to customers just because you are overwhelmed and busy. I was honestly more on the disappointed side today with my visit.

If I return, it will only be for the carnitas & barbacoa early in the AM to avoid upset workers & the lunch rush.<//text>< response>

I,ve been there when they are closing up and they toss hot water on counters to clean and let the water spill on the ground and another employee mops the spilt water with meat left overs on the ground!

(Translated by Google) Food is decent. The girl who waited on me should work herding cattle, not customer service.

<text>If you're seeking a gym that has an incredible community of people who truly care about you and your goals, look no further. I'm a late-30s mom of two and business owner. I'm juggling a lot day to day, and after 2 kids, I'm still working up to the active person I once was. What really differentiates this gym from others is that when I walk into Project 13, I feel like the people there truly care about *me*. Every day I'm there, I get a great workout, led by two outstanding trainers, Nate and Thomas. And I'm also supported by an incredible group of Project 13 fans who heartily cheer my success, both in the gym and out. It's a welcoming, positive, motivating place to become your best you. Can't recommend this gym highly enough!< /text><Response>None<//Response><time>1595221330275< /time>< user_name>

Rock Climbing is supposed to be fun, but not here, "thanks" to the employees. They act like they are being forced to be there. It's a shame because the gym is nice.< /text>

1. Great staff cleanly work out equipment.

2.lockers are getting a bit work for like 1 or 2 in boys bathroom and need soap containers and new valves in bathrooms (boys)

3.basketball court is nice and clean well kept. Pool is also excellent conditions there's 2 pools and 1 hot tub.

Need more funding I guess so they can fix those problems but great facility overall.< /Text>

I've been a member for about 16 years. Place is decent for the money, although I wish they had a senior rate and complimentary towels. I've met some wonderful people there...not snooty like other places I used to frequent. Massage room isn't available for some reason. I'd love to get one there if the opportunity was available.<//Text>

There is absolutely NO parking available.  Teensy tiny little poor excuse of a parking lot.  Street parking is hard to find, too.  I tried calling the front desk to ask a question.....no one answers the phone there.  The door to go into the workout room from the lobby weighs a ton and is not ADA friendly.  I think the Collins-Katz YMCA in Santa Monica/WLA is the best I have seen yet.  But not this one in Westchester.</Text>

I am so disappointed in this YMCA. I don't know who is in charge but they need to be fired immediately. It seems to get dirtier everytime I go in for a workout. The Group exercise room took several months on and off to complete. it was excessive. If they hired professionals, the job would've been done in a week tops.

Friendly and nice people overall but awfully mismanaged gym. Jade the gym manager has no idea how to run a gym. I talked to her a few times and she is clueless. They have classes in the Kidzone which looked my teenage son's room. Hot and cluttered, a mess!

I am so upset that they lost Lynn, how unfortunate. She is a really good teacher. Now I found out that the HIIT class with Li is also cancelled. Why can't they seem to hold on to good peop;e?

Women's and men's locker room are disgusting. Who has carpet in a bathroom? it's so gross. And why is there music? it's god awful playlist. It skips and it is so annoying. I take my showers at home now.

They are renno the annex which is long overdue. It's old and dingy, a relic from the 60's YWCA.  Thank god it's being torn down< /text>

Bad experience at this location only, with employees that, first, didn't want to help me with accessing necessary equipment for my workout when employees on a previous day did. Second, they singled me out and made me stop my workout immediately even though no one else in the gym at the time was in danger, affected, bothered, nothing. I was doing a body weight exercise called altitude drops which is basically stepping off a platform down into a jump ready position. Very little spaced is needed. They didn't bother to  ask or understand what I was doing and said I was "jumping off" the platform I put in the corner of the main exercise room away from everyone. If the guy at first was willing to help me he would have known what I was going to do and suggest an alternative but good member service for some reason wasn't on his mind at the time for me. After I said to an old lady with a cane that what she did to disrupt my workout was "ridiculous" she started yelling at me as if I wasn't allowed to have an opinion. They later called the manager and really made me out to be the bad guy when all I was trying to do was my workout and the only person being bothered and treated bad was me by the staff. The manager also did a poor job showing appreciation to me as a paying member of the facility.< /text>

This plaza opened in 2009, and the main feature is a 9 stair set with two handrails, there are also many ledges, a manual pad, an extended 4 stair and a 7 stair, and some assorted ramps.< /Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>We love the vibe at the Inn at Moonlight Beach. Not only is the staff extremely attentive, the location of the Inn is terrific. We walked and biked each day we were there. We added a snack, champagne and massage package that was totally worth it. The  breakfast each morning was delicious and we purchased many of the homemade honey and teas to bring home as gifts. The grounds are meticulously landscaped and provide a zen space for you to relax.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc0c5d172a7503:0x79640a6e9cd5f8d3< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>It is rare that beautiful, experiential and health conscious concepts are executed with such charm and grace. We were so fortunate to spend a night cutting flowers and herbs in the garden, adding them to a tea bath and relaxing on our private patio watching the sun set. Breakfast was immensely satisfying and goodwill pervades the air. Highly recommend and will return!< /text>< pictures>

Many unique touches, such as hot herbal tea brewed and waiting for your arrival in your room, spa bath with house-made sachets, whole-property filtered water, yummy chocolates, wonderful smelling soap. The rooms, while small, have been very thoughtfully equipped to encourage a healthful and relaxing experience. My only suggestion for this property would be that there's quite a bit of clutter around the TV area that detracts from the otherwise calming atmosphere. Perhaps putting the many instructions and notices in a binder and placed in the desk organizer would create a more spacious and minimalist aspect.< /review>

Stunning little gem in Encinitas. Beautiful, quite, clean and very relaxing. Room has everything you need and smells amazing. Staff is friendly  and very accommodating. Grounds are beautiful. For breakfast we got toast, hard boiled eggs, overnight oats, green juice, yogurt  with granola and fruit. We will definitely be back.< /review>

<Review>A space that is designed for and actually cares for your well being. Located close to the beaches, this beautiful inn has beautiful outdoor spaces that help you feel calm and relaxed, 8 small gardens, organic tea and breads in the lobby, and a friendly and courteous staff. Just look at the photos!<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCQNcotwGWgRlIIV9gex33x6F4pAQsT7OpttwJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHrMinf6PGI9f-9siX0-HU2IW2U-e67GX8KPEY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPHGyl_aKcOwyce3ItCM3h-8LacUoGodUOv50-9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjWv8vETapZtwlEOSksUSECN8TfjEBYjVZx0ks=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQuK38udCU8JnoZRERBk-gXZnZJBJhwE9-ENps=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGQH14i1fzOI-pSx_0JunqZb_nqCr_wN-WEUF0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPja_pMnSqgOLDZ_6HdlfAmydqzaK2TAQYmfNwt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAgcA9xRFgpB1o4Xi8w15-ECCPBWCl3_fxj5Lw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqq9jwDyxTUt22wOO_XC0leZdZVIEEs84ekLz4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPeo3ebeYJLi0iEUejBMooMurKUHCX0W0ondG0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdUIbh9K4GUejblaqalhatR0k_xAPnwBUHCG13=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpAJOEG5F8zf2eYZgRtMa3O9EepfRk8ThtLCp3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOz6MdYcid6iXsYUMTnhNfEOzobXUm8TOYdbbm4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIjgx5K-P1RouxUiCeKP4rD90lKARZhmCkv5cR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM4ons7jLPZBfsRR8Ewom322XPKpX8mvfGZVfD9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvaffQinz0MTlx7F0897mnWD4ANyjQ_xa0G0gn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrqRTBk9e9WgJViK2UKo5jnaBlJegRhbH8pMmt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6FuIpXgZLgNSbG_ERyGJbNZy1WNzIuPIdNv9j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPOPkPjHLR51UHn9IkDpWCuz1TG-Q0tYhCDhICa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqRycSyLSk-d0HwayzAERC3tVRD6QbHyt_5TiC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6cAVSlXdPpgoQ8A-CJpIgqcbvwoNgTcqbCDph=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVNdW-P7L31xuI6phs860QlBhsUcYXqSx8DX6o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqrE8yjpDufdUHOmkX7vzvAgO4N9JC5Je1ohuG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYqmDvmUzKn7DZEBXW5nCG3i7Mzul2jNPaKXBr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVLMfq-EvIVt-vljVbQSGRiA0Paqc-S8uphVha=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoB8EkMpYgoFBt8_9PMF-IsQCNjLR1O2Bdk4Tp=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5p9A84hIWtEdz5DTp0AqSM6n8M_OHKT43IlKd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>This place is a MAGICAL GEM!!! Stayed here for two nights and loved every single second. The property is completely zen-ed out and the perfect place to escape reality for a bit. Everything from the meditation deck to the herb garden to the fire pit and to our personal patio space was so relaxing! Stayed in one of the garden rooms, which was plenty space for two adults. Really enjoyed all of the special details in the room. It was awesome to walk into our room for the first time and see the wellness tea and chocolate/fruit platter waiting for us, both of which were so delicious. I chose this place as a getaway versus a bigger hotel because I wanted to stay in a small place with less people to be safer during this pandemic and also to support a small business. We felt completely safe the entire time, hardly saw anyone, and anytime we saw staff they were always wearing masks which I super appreciated! The cherry on top of our stay here was the helpfulness and kindness of Morgan!!! Right from the moment we got there her warmth made us feel incredibly welcome and right at home, and her thoughtfulness throughout our entire stay was so appreciated. We knew right away that we wanted to come back here soon. We now have so many wonderful memories because of the Inn at Moonlight Beach and couldn’t recommend this place enough!!!<//Text><name>Rachel Rose<//name><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay for three nights over Presidents Day weekend. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the grounds and gardens are full of little surprises. We especially liked sitting on our porch watching the sun set.
It is also within walking distance of the beach and many Encinitas restaurants.
The staff is very responsive and accommodating and we couldn’t imagine a better place to stay in this area, particularly for those who prefer a smaller more intimate experience.
We look forward to returning especially after COVID restrictions when we can enjoy all that the Inn has to offer. Highly recommended.< /Review>

We are locals and had a staycation on Valentine's Day. We couldn't have had a lovelier experience.  The staff was thoughtful and response times were great.  The room was beautiful!!  We walked into prepared tea, lit tea candles, a little board with edible flowers and chocolate covered strawberries.  This was unexpected and delicious.  The grounds are perfectly landscaped with herbs and flowers.  We did the tea bath add on which was just lovely in their large soaking tub.  A form to select your breakfast is provided, with easy submission of simply texting a photo.  Our breakfast was cutely packed and waiting for us when we awoke.  We enjoyed our breakfast on the patio, overlooking the gardens.  Everything is locally sourced from honey to fresh juices.  You'll feel good about supporting this business and you'll have a great and relaxing time.

We couldn't have had a nicer experience and will absolutely be back.<//text>

Tucked away in a lush garden setting on the side of a hill lies this wonderful retreat that focuses on connecting with nature and with oneself. We had a one night reservation so we got there right around the 3pm check-in time to make the most of our stay.  The staff was very welcoming and friendly. The property was smaller than I thought it would be, but the fact that the Inn is only a 6 room bed and breakfast adds to the intimacy of the place, and made it feel so cozy. The property and our room was so clean, and the Covid measures they had in place felt very safe and made me feel comfortable. We stayed in the Rosemary room which is one of the rooms on the bottom level. The room had an outside deck to sit at which overlooked the outside gardens which is a shared common space for the other rooms as well. A couple of guests were enjoying the outside table next to the water feature the next morning, but that did not bother me, and the deck still felt fairly private at night. The garden was lovely to walk through and you can feel free to clip some fresh herbs from the garden to enjoy at home. There are many succulent plants growing there, and you can purchase them to take home, with the smallest plants starting at two dollars.
The holistic vibe continues with a focus on the healing energy of nature such as through crystals, for instance there is a large selenite globe in your room, and you can purchase other crystals from the small display cases in the lobby. I purchased some honey, fresh preserves, and bath salts to take home. The room was very comfortable with a sitting area, and a nice kitchenette including a microwave, dishes, and utensils.
The bed was very comfy and I slept wonderfully. The humidifier, and the sound machine, which you could change to hear sounds of the ocean, rainfall, etc, added to the relaxing vibe. There was a very large flat screen TV, but did not feel the need to turn it on because it was so peaceful just listening to the sound machine, or my bluetooth speaker I brought from home, or the croaking of the frogs out in the garden at night. The included herbal flower tea bath set was a great way to end the day in the deep soak bathtub, tea light candles are also provided to add to the ambiance. The included fresh herbal tea setup served in a clear glass kettle that is kept warm over a tea light burner, as well as a snack plate with dried fruits, nuts, and organic chocolates, is a lovely welcome in your room upon check in. Breakfast is delivered outside your room in the morning. It is not a hot breakfast, but was still a very delicious assortment of items such as yogurt parfaits, bakery goods, fruit, and boiled eggs, which you can pre-select the night before. In addition to the many complimentary offers, the availability of the various add-ons is a great way to enhance the experience of your stay. For my birthday stay here I added the herbal foot soak which is enjoyed out on the deck, and was served with more hot herbal tea to enjoy. I also added the Full Moon package which included extras such as a large charcuterie board, sparkling wine, a large fresh flower bouquet from the garden, a meditation kit including items such as a selenite stone, and complementary late checkout.  The Inn is a short walk to Moonlight Beach, be sure to stop at the very unique rock garden on your way there. The nearby Cottonwood Creek park was lovely to stroll through, and downtown Encinitas is a short walk away as well. Just be advised that there is no sidewalk from the Inn down to the street corner, so be aware of cars, or when walking at night. I walked to nearby Chiko, they served delicious Asian fusion cuisine and brought it back to our room, but you can also have food delivered to the Inn from one of the nearby restaurants if you don’t want to walk at night. I would highly recommend the Inn at Moonlight Beach for anyone looking for a peaceful place to relax and recharge!</Text>

<Review>Very pleasant experience. The staff really care and make the effort safety wise (COVID safety precautions, masks, etc.) which was really nice. We also really liked the atmosphere, peaceful, zen, garden, ecosystem friendly. Great location and style. Feels nice and homey and quaint. Anti-corporate anti-commercialized, feels all down to earth. All 5 stars in my book! Thanks.</Review><pics>None</pics><Date>1595909181704<//Date><gmapID>0x80dc0c5d172a7503:0x79640a6e9cd5f8d3< /gmapID>< Rating>

This was a fantastic little, one of a kind Inn. We had a wonderful stay and will definitely return. It is cozy and tranquil, full of great little touches like a pot of hot tea in your room upon arrival and breakfast baskets delivered to your door each morning. There are lots of restaurants and great beaches nearby, or you could read a book on your private deck or meditate in the gardens. When I think of zen, this is the new standard and if peaceful is what you are looking for, this is the place to stay.<//review>

Lovely gem located away from the beach crowd but close enough to walk to beach and downtown Encinitas. Wonderful attention to detail and delightful quirks like a garden you can pluck from and Eastern-inspired sculptures in the garden. We had a quick getaway from San Diego and feel totally rejuvenated!<//Text>

My wife and I honeymooned here for a whole week and it was absolutely incredible! Even with all the covid stuff going on. They were very safe and accommodating. Everything at this place was top notch. The bed was extremely comfortable, the breakfast at your door was healthy delicious and fresh and the location is unbeatable. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay, well worth every penny, hope to be back soon.<//text>

This Is my new favorite in Encinitas. The accommodations are superb and the staff is so warm and welcoming. They’ve created a little paradise walking distance to the beach, restaurants and shopping. It is beautifully designed both inside and out. We stayed in the Thyme suite, which had lovely views of a terraced garden, a private balcony, two sitting areas, a small kitchen, a private bedroom and everything you’d imagine to make you feel comfortable and relaxed. We forgot to order breakfast the night before and they delivered a delicious meal to our room In the morning without even asking.  Can’t wait to stay here again.</Review>

<Time>1599591122611<//Time><Text>My boyfriend and I stayed at the Inn at Moonlight Beach for his 50th birthday.  We felt that based on the size of the property and the commitment to wellness that we would be safe here.  It was tranquil and blissful.  The rooms are spacious, clean and well air-conditioned. The patio off of our room was beautiful, comfortable and peaceful. I loved our bathtub. I arranged for a charcuterie board for our arrival. It was abundant with cheese, meats, fruits and nuts. The Inn provided bags of herbs and real flowers to put in the bath. That was a fabulous experience. The kitchenette is well stocked with amenities. The breakfast was delicious. The owner was on hand to give us a tour of the property. We picked fruit grown on the property in their bio-dynamic farm. There is also a firepit and seating area to enjoy an evening outdoors with smores. Yum. We loved that.  The main drag of town, Encinitas, is just a few blocks away as is the beach.  We had dinner in Encinitas during our stay and went to the beach prior to the arrival. It was a wonderful experience.  We cannot wait to go back.</Text><gmapID>0x80dc0c5d172a7503:0x79640a6e9cd5f8d3<//gmapID></record>

My three day stay at the Inn at Moonlight Beach was an incredible experience that I highly recommend to anyone wanting to visit the town or simply have a relaxing and rejuvenating stay. This inn has so many caring details that you just don’t find anywhere else. The freshly harvested tea bath bags (from their garden!!), the harvesting basket, the freshly cut fruit from the garden in the lounge area (amongst many other snacks), the incredibly soft sheets and the generous and kind staff were all details that made my experience at the inn spectacular. I am so looking forward to my next stay! Thank you Inn at Moonlight Beach for creating such an authentic and unique experience that allowed to me fully relax!</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>This is our favorite getaway place from LA. Its a gorgeous, well planned and well kept hideway.  Shangwen the owner has taken it to the next level with planning and thoughtfulness, from a full biodynamic herb garden that you can get clippings from,
To a staff that is mindful and attentive.

Highlights: a full standalone bath with herb teas to soak in

Secluded rooms with high end bedding

A welcome tray with chocolate truffles, fruits

Breakfast basket that is WELL beyond most "included" breakfasts, with vegan and vegetarian options

A short walk to the beach

A view of the water

King size beds, low to the ground</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

My wife Heather and I recently stayed at the Inn at Moonlight Beach, and everything about our stay here was beyond exceptional. From the moment we walked in and saw the fresh-cut flowers, we knew this was a special place. We booked our room during the Covid-19 pandemic, but we felt extremely safe and well taken care of. Morgan (our host) and staff all wore masks, and while everyone was very friendly and attentive, there was very little direct contact due to precautions taken. Wonderful, healthy breakfasts waited at our door every morning. The Inn is very close to fine restaurants and, of course, Moonlight Beach. We had originally booked our stay for 3 nights, but we enjoyed our stay so much we ended up staying a 4th night! We will definitely be back!< /Text>

<Review>My husband and I chose the Inn at Moonlight Beach for our anniversary trip this year, and it was FABULOUS! The inn was exceptionally clean, and our room was perfect.  We splurged for the ocean suite and were not disappointed - the private balcony was perfect for breakfast in the morning, and to get some sun in the afternoon. The bed was very comfortable and the towels were plush. While the staff were almost never seen due to COVID-19, they were always accessible via text message and quick to respond to our needs. The inn is accessible to everything you will want during a trip to Encinitas. Walk to the beach and the 101, take the freeway to other areas like Del Mar and Carlsbad... you can't go wrong. The team has truly created a perfect getaway and we hope to return in the future. Thank you for everything!<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>We were blown away by the attention to detail in the Master Suite! There was tea bubbling, an assortment of dark chocolate, fresh picked herbs for a bath, and a diffuser already running. The owner came to show us personally when she saw us arrive late, and her passion was evident about her creation. The beds were amazingly comfortable and the view was quite nice, with an oceanview. The breakfast options were perfect for our stay, as one of us is vegetarian and one is dairy free. The shampoos and creams are all EO which is a great brand and nourishing. We also enjoyed picking fresh herbs from their herb garden in the morning. Again, the detail was so appreciated and she waved us goodbye when we left. Definitely will be coming back.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I was in desperate need to take a break and restore my mind, body and soul. The Inn at Moonlight Beach was the perfect place to do this. The Inn at Moonlight Beach takes into consideration your entire experience down to the littlest detail, from the bath salts, the sheets, the fresh aromatherapy in your room, to the tea in the morning, and sitting out in the meditation garden. I spent four nights and left completely refreshed ready to face the world that was waiting for me.<//review>< pictures>

This was a special occasion & the Inn at Moonlight Beach hit the spot. It is a “Well” inn that truly made us feel peaceful, meditative & cared for. We had a room on the 2nd floor with a view, lovely. The bed was very comfortable & we really enjoyed the sheets. Also enjoyed the tea, dried fruit & breakfast.</text>

The property is a Well(R) platinum certified place, which means it is a haven for humans.  The colors and textures and details create comfort and are neutrally-pleasing; the touches such as sprigs of rosemary and candles create a sense of coziness, the soundscape relaxes.  The landscaping is fantastic and secluded (especially given the limited space), and overall - the place is perfect to relax in for a couple of days.  Finally, perhaps this place is not the type to briefly stop in to spend the night in middle of traveling - you will not appreciate the beauty.<//text>

The owner and staff were very kind and accommodating - a lot of thought was put into everything, and all the amenities too. Access to a kitchen at all hours with fresh drink and snacks, beach supplies, fresh gardens and holistic foods are just to name a few. The location is within walking distance to the town and beach. The room was clean and bright. We will be back for sure! Highly recommended - and THANK YOU!!<//Review><user_id>112181660937392044032< /user_id><GmapID>0x80dc0c5d172a7503:0x79640a6e9cd5f8d3</GmapID></record>

I never take the time to write reviews but this place was special. Very zen and thoughtful. Great room. Nice bed. Beautiful common area kitchen with healthy foods and teas and everything you need to feel at home. Walk to moonlight beach.< /text>

<Text>This a unique property, small & intimate. I was happily surprised on my arrival I discovered a well attired garden suite, with herbs complimenting the property. I enjoyed the quiet, peacefulness of my evening. The tea is excellent. The breakfast was filling & healthy. I recommend the Inn at Moonlight Beach.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<rate>5</rate><review>We stayed in this wonderful place last week.  Judging from the pictures in the lobby, three years ago this small hotel was run down, ugly, and totally lacking in charm.  But the new owner, with amazing vision, has magically transformed it into a welcoming place of beauty and serenity, surrounded by herbs and other, often edible, landscaping.  Definitely a worthwhile destination in its own right, it is also walking distance from both the beach and a variety of good restaurants, and a short drive from one of the top botanical gardens in the country, the San Diego Botanic Garden.<//review>< pics>

<Text>A wonderful and serene getaway in charming Encinitas. No detail goes unnoticed, here! From the herbal tea and snack tray, to the curated items in your room, and the systems in the building (air filtration, water purification system, aromatherapy) everything is thoughtful and intentional. Staying here will leave you rested and inspired.... an unparalleled local experience. Very close to excellent (and affordable!) dining options, coffee, ice cream, and the beach. I also appreciated the lengths they went to for cleaning and social distancing during the Covid-19 breakout. I could not have felt safer. Thank you for a wonderful stay, I can't wait to be back!<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Super organic and clean inn.

Location: It is about a 10 minute walk to the beach or to downtown Encenitas.

What I loved: organic breakfast, organic teas, and supplies to use at the beach, beautiful garden to drink coffee early in the morn.< /Text><user_id>103823011218215103813<//user_id>< pics>

<Review>I loved the beautifully landscaped gardens, amazing architecture and the peaceful setting of the inn.  The owner is so sweet and was very attentive to our needs.  The entire time I was at the inn I felt completely relaxed.  The owner provided us with a healthy breakfast which was put inside a picnic basket.  It was very nice to have the option to take the picnic basket to the beach or eat on the lovely grounds.  I will go back again if I go to San Diego.< /Review>< Rating>

<text>The Inn at Moonlight Beach is totally relaxing, comfortable, friendly, beautiful - I could go on.  The grounds are gorgeously landscaped with fountains and quiet sitting areas scattered about.  There were fresh flowers and a pot of hot tea in our room when we arrived.  Organic snacks are available in the welcome area.  A delicious breakfast basket was delivered to our door each morning.  The owner and manager both welcomed us and made us feel at home.   Our room was immaculately clean.  Luxurious toiletries were provided - along with a soaking tub and bathrobes.  Next time Im anywhere near Moonlight Beach, Ill be staying at the Inn.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>When I booked a room at Inn at Moonlight Beach for a birthday/anniversary weekend, I had no idea that we would be staying at such a special place. Every square foot, inside and out, is perfectly designed, decorated, or landscaped. Wellness teas and homemade dried fruits are available all day and evening, along with many other healthy and delicious treats. Breakfast arrives each morning in a picnic basket at your doorstep. The beach and the main street are a 10-minute walk away. Don’t miss the opportunity to stay here!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>A serene getaway within Encinitas.  Lots of lovely perks such as snacks and drinks in the lobby, in room diffuser, bath robes, and more.  They really have thought of everything.  The room feels so much like home.  And the beach is only a short walk away!  Whole-heartedly recommend this place!< /review>< GmapID>

<Review>Very nice rooms and common areas inside. It is closer to a busy road than we realized, so it's a bit noisy with the patio door open. Sound generators are used to help create a more calming atmosphere, but it's only partly successful. Breakfast options are just OK. It's a mix of crunchy granola-style vegan baked goods and Quaker instant oatmeal. Neither worked particularly well for me. The juices, hard boiled egg, and fruit were fine. There are very nice snacks available in the breakfast bar area. Baked goods, fruit, and cheese, coffee, tea, and even some wine. Room decor is very tasteful. Bedding is good, but we believe the sheets are microfiber. While soft, they don't breathe and are too warm as a result.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>Wow! Who knew there is such an amazing and relaxing place to stay right down the street. After driving by their sign countless times, we finally decided to stay the night here and we couldn't be more happy that we did. Walking distance to some of our favorite restaurants and the room was amazing. All the little extras, snacks, drinks and common space was incredible. The mattress was super comfy and pillows were great too. The hosts were very accommodating and welcoming. I can't wait to have friends and family visit so they can stay here!</Review>< pics>

<review>As someone who is passionate about sustainable travel, I was blown away by Inn at Moonlight's conscious efforts to reduce waste and encourage connection with other travelers and with yourself (through a beautiful meditation garden and sound bath sitting area for example). I was a huge fan of the DIY tea station and on-site biodynamic herb garden where guests are free to harvest their own herbs. The hotel team was always around and helpful, but also made you feel like they were welcoming you into their family living room. I worked from the communal area in the morning, and moved out into the sunshine on the patio once it got warmer. Cannot recommend this beautiful property enough!!</review><time>1571072485600< /time><rate>5< /rate><Resp>None< /Resp><UserId.>102100358323645194705< /UserId.><gmapID>0x80dc0c5d172a7503:0x79640a6e9cd5f8d3< /gmapID>< Pictures>

<review>We stayed one night and instantly fell in love with this Inn. The lobby is large, open and the most inviting lobby I've ever set foot in. The art and decor is very thoughtful and I was instantly comfortable and impressed.

After entering our suite, I was blown away by how every detail was exactly how I would personally prefer it.
All of the water is filtered, even the shower. They offer Organic Tea, healthy snacks and even have an essential oil diffuser going when you walk in the door. The patio outside of the kitchen had a lovely view of the garden and meditation space, it was lovely to look out while sipping tea in the morning.

I would refer this place to any friends or family staying in San Diego. Wonderful location and a beautiful property!< /review>< date>

< Review>
I felt so taken care of at this Inn, I really didn't want to leave. Well thought out details such as the beautiful healthy breakfast baskets, common room full of healthy treats and great books, the use of non-toxic cleaning products, filtered water everywhere, aromatherapy, organic biodynamic garden available to guests, rooms with very clean, updated and tasteful furniture and appliances - I was extremely impressed. This is the future of hospitality. I will be coming back!<//Review>

<text>I could not have asked for a more relaxing and inviting experience.  I was so stressed out with work and a super active toddler.  As soon as I walked into the hallway leading to my room, it was as if my entire body said, "Ahhhhh....now you can relax".  Thank you thank you Thank You!!  I needed a break so bad and your hotel was absolutely wonderful, peaceful and everything I needed to get away.  The room was super clean.  The aromatherapy in the room was spot on and smelled amazing.  I will be back :)<//text>< pictures>

<text>My husband and I chose to stay at this “luxury” hotel for a relaxing experience and unfortunately, this was not our experience.  We booked a deluxe garden suite and learned quickly that this lower level unit offered minimal insulation between floors resulting in a loud, non-relaxing stay.  Unfortunately, we were woken up during the late night and early morning hours to guest "stomping" above us - 6:30am, 11:30pm-12:30am & 7am - which did not compliment the already busy street and passing by train outside our window.  Due to the website description and price point, we expected higher standards and were extremely disappointed. We did not have a relaxing retreat experience and did not leave feeling renewed but instead tired & frustrated.  Very disappointed, would not recommend!</text><time>1537854260065<//time></record>

<Text>This is hands down the best place to stay in Encinitas!! My girlfriend and I stayed for my birthday and had an amazing time. The rooms are modern and extremely relaxing. The property overlooks the beautiful ocean. Waking up to gluten free oatmeal and fresh fruits to eat while watching the sun rise is an experience to remember. Great proximity to downtown Encinitas and the beautiful Moonlight beach. This place has it all the modern amenities and looks like something out of a interior design magazine. You will not want to leave.. Highly recommend</Text>< Rate>

Friendly place but misleading on what you get. Beach is not two blocks away. It is a good 5 blocks away at least. I was looking forward to homemade pastries right out of the oven. We received coffee cake  that wasn't right out of the oven. No muffins or pastries. Also  no yogurt but 4 kinds of cheese which I was not expecting for a breakfast. The bed was nice and a clean place.<//Text>

PURE MAGIC. If you are looking for a sacred, grounding, rejuvenating, relaxing, beautifully energetic space filled with love, grace and peace….this is your spot. This hidden gem will truly amaze you and let me share why…

I was intrigued to learn from our lovely hostess (who actually is the amazing architect of this sacred space) that this Inn actually meets WELL building standards which means that the space itself enhances human heath and well-being through design and operational features of the environment (such as the biodynamic gardens, water, air, atmosphere and lighting). WELL building standards look into the connection between the physical building and the wellbeing of whomever inherits the space. SO COOL and inspirational that buildings can actually leave people and the environment better off than before they spent time in the building.

THE COMMON SPACE: One of my favorite parts of the space is the communal living room and kitchen hang out area. This space is soooo lovely, inviting and calming. It has an amazing indoor-outdoor feel to it with the ambiance sounds and decor that made me feel very connected to nature. There are all sorts of healing herbal teas, spices, roots and herbs, snacks, fruit and vegetables from the on-site gardens and the most amazing coffee! It is a help-yourself style kitchen and so you feel like you are home, which is such a unique experience for an Inn environment. There is also an extensive book shelf with a range of books that bring insight, awareness and inspiration to your life! The yoga deck is another feature that I truly appreciated having available.

THE ROOM: #FengShuiAllDay! WOW - another amazing, oh so cozy and comforting, beautiful space. I stayed in the Sage room - Ocean view balcony … need I say any more? Upon entering the room there was hot tea and aromatherapy awaiting my arrival, which was so welcoming. Aside from the space being amazing, the bed and pillows were SO comfortable! I bring my own pillow with me everywhere and I actually forgot my pillow and I was so pleased that these pillows beat my own pillow times 10! So luxurious. I had everything I needed! In the morning a picnic basket filled with all sorts of delicious complimentary breakfast goodies was waiting on my doorstep! This was a perfect place for a romantic stay with my boyfriend :) I’d also consider coming here for a weekend meditation retreat or for a rejuvenation weekend.

I had such an experience of being welcomed and at home in the grace of contribution and love from our exceptional hostess, the lovely inn keeper and from the environment itself. Inn at Moonlight deserves a 10 star rating from me!!! :)

I hope anyone reading this enjoys his or her stay as much as I did! You will be left feeling peaceful, connected and powerful after your stay. Enjoy! :)</review>

<text>My husband and I stayed at the Inn at Moonlight Beach for staycation. I loved that the place is a newly renovated located next to the beach. We walk into the room with fresh fruits, snacks, and calming music. We check out the patio and look up outside to see the stars.

We enjoyed sleeping in the comfy king size bed and soaking in the tub.
The best views are waking up to the view of the ocean and feeling the fresh breeze when we opened the sliding door. I felt relaxed and well taken care of. Every detail in the place was purposeful, clean and beautiful.

I highly recommend stopping by the Self-RealizationFellowship Temple in Encinitas or Moonlight Beach to enjoy stunning ocean views. I'd definitely come back and stay here again.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

< review>
I have been here several times and never a single time I was let down. I usually order the 3 course menu ($60) including appetizer, pasta, and an entree. Yes the portion is smaller than a la carte, but neither my partner nor I felt we needed to order more. The Chef is also good at making soup. It’s so good I was seriously considering order a regular bowl.

Wine by glass is quite pricey, usually between $12-15/glass. We decided to go with a bottle that fits within the budget we are more comfortable with.

It’s a family owned restaurant so maybe that’s why it feels even more homier.  The paintings on the walls were painted by the mother of the chef.  It does get busy on the weekends. It’ll make the whole dining experience even better if they can reduce the number of tables in the restaurant. Our table was really close to other tables it reminded me of my dining experience in Paris.< /review>

Cute little venue serving adventurous if not wholly successful dishes.  Best of the night: Mixed berry pavlova was a wondrous dish with the best meringue I've ever had.  Worst: pesto fettuccine with chicken meatballs had dry meat and flavorless sauce... Solid concept, but executed disappointingly.  Most interesting: parmesan custard and pea budino was a delightfully delicate adventure of mild, summery flavors and creamy textures.</text>

<Text>To me Persephone epitomizes Aptos. The food is absolutely stellar but the atmosphere is so down to earth and comfortable. It's like eating at your friend's house... your friend who also happens to be a Michelin rated chef. Often at upper-scale restaurants the food is delicious but they tend to be snooty and awkward.

<Text>Absolutely excellent. I enjoyed the food, the service, everything. Our waiter was also an owner, and he obviously loves his work. We had a number of food allergies represented in our party, and they were accommodating of everything we threw at them. We also brought kids! Gasp! They took good care of the kids, too.

I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. Go. Enjoy great food from dedicated workers, and support a local business. You won't regret it.</Text></record>

Had an excellent dinner here recently with my brother.  We both started off with a local beer (they have a great selection of local beers). We ordered soup to start, he the sausage lentil and I the butternut squash.  Both soups were delicious. He had the fresh albacore tuna entree and loved it.  I had a homeade pasta dish that was very yummy.  Homemade bread served with dinner too.  The service was excellent.  Great place to celebrate a special occasion. This is a family run business. Definitely a keeper.<//review>

Painfully disappointing. Waitstaff started out friendly and nice then things went south. Orders were mixed up, delay in service. Lack of acknowledgment about mistakes. This is a reflection on the managements style or lack of. We wanted a fine dining experience but it didn't happen. We hope this helps because we want you to succeed.</review>

Delicious, original cuisine served here. A cozy little restaurant, with an amazing, professional staff. Some complain at the prices, but for sustainable, organic as you can get in Aptos , hand made food by experienced chefs you should expect this much quality in SF. Be happy you saved 4 hours round trip in gas. Excellent wine selection. It's a great place to take someone you love.< /text>

I got the goat cheese and beet salad, strip loin steak, and the hazelnut semifreddo; and my wife got the roasted radish soup, ricotta and artichoke stuffed Fogline Farm chicken, and the chocolate orange tart. Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was excellent too.

Had yet another fabulous dinner at Persephone! Everything on the menu looked wonderful, but the Beet and Apple Budino appetizer was out of this world, as was the Honey Dijon glazed Albacore. I highly recommend those! My friend had a great Butternut Squash soup and the Pomegranate glazed chicken which was also outstanding.
That, and the fact that the restaurant's design is stunning, make Persephone my all time favorite! Run, don't walk!< /review>

<review>Great little unpretentious restaurant with a brother/sister team.  She's a classically trained chef with new ideas about fresh, local, organic ingredients and he takes care of everything else.

It's a small venue that seats maybe 30, so reservations are suggested. We went to a winemakers dinner and each course was paired very well with the wines.</review>< pics>

They try to have a vegan selection but so far it hasn't been very good . I've been here twice and once was absolutely wonderful but the second time was just so so and it's a very expensive so so. I'm really rooting for this restaurant . Aptos needs fine dining restaurants so I do encourage people to try it . Perhaps my second visit was a fluke and generally it's as wonderful as it was the first time I was there< /text>

<review>Service and food was great! I was surprised at how reasonable and comfortable it was. Not a “froofy” fine dining place, fits well into aptos. Extensive and affordable local wine list. Will come back!<//review>< pictures>

Food was wonderful. We had 3 course pre fix and was it was all so rich that I took some home. It's  a seasonal menu so changes all the time. The space is small but quietly elegant.</Review>

<text>Food is decent. Service is ok. But I expected a lot more than 4 raviolis when in cost me 28 bucks. There's a lot of potential here but it was honestly disappointing overall.< /text><resp>None</resp>< name>

I had one of the best meals and dining experiences at Persephone last night! It is one of those newer gems Santa Cruz is fortunate enough to have open up. I think this place will be around for the long haul. They have all the important pieces in place: a gifted visionary chef, great menu with local and sustainable ingredients, well trained wait staff, fabulous management, beautiful decor and ambiance, good volume levels, and a desire to continue to grow and evolve to make things better and better (even while they're clearly already doing an amazing job)! I am delighted to have finally made it I'm for a memorable meal. I look forward to returning again soon and becoming better acquainted with the owners and staff and their changing menu. Don't wait, call and make your reservation now!< /text>

Delicious food, with a very pleasing aesthetic.

Update 4/5/18:
On second visit the dinner was fairly bland. The menu was ambitious, but the dishes lacked flavor. I had a chicken stuffed with feta and sun-dried tomato, and my girlfriend had a beef pasta, both seemed like they were salt deficient and the pasta was overcooked.

Our appetizers were also fairly ambitious, hers was a bitter greens salad with prosciutto and a duck egg in which the flavors didn't quite mix. Mine was a mandarin and fennel salad that had good flavor but was very limp.

The wine selection was great, and the cider was quite delicious.

We did not have any desserts because they were out of the panna cotta at 7pm. The other desserts looked like they could be good, but just weren't appealing to us.

Overall, it was quite a let down tonight after being so great the first time as went in. However, the aesthetic is still nice and the sourdough focaccia they served upon seating us was delicious.< /Text>

This is the “BEST” Chipotle. I order a salad from them about (3-4) times a week. The food is always fresh & taste delicious🤗
Here is where my review gets more personal.
The staff & customer service @ this Chipotle is excellent! They are always so kind & friendly & they go above & beyond to make sure that their customers are happy.
I usually order an extra side of sour cream on the side every time I order. Last week when I called,
I simply forgot. When I received my delivery bag, inside was an extra side of sour cream.
They take the extra time to get to know their customers and they remembered that this is something that I always request and like.
It’s multiple staff who take h take the extra step to not only get to know you but to make sure that you are happy.
Simple things like this mean a lot👍🏼
Today I spoke with one of the staff who again said to me: We will make sure that we put some vinaigrette dressing and extra sour cream in your order. They are so nice😄

Thank you Chipotle Baldwin Park🏆<//review>

I ordered 3 hard shell tacos and a large guacamole with chips... I got my food and it was cold when I literally live 2.2 miles away from the BP location. I then woke up this morning to having food poisoning as I have been throwing up and having to use the restroom non stop since 3 AM this morning... I’m going to be looking into taking legal action against this location as it seems I’m not the only one per their reviews that has had such a terrible experience with the food from this location</Text>

<Review>Went to get 3 burrito bowls ,the server and cashier were super rude , when I was putting my order she kept closing the bowl before I could finish and threw the lid when I asked for pico de Gallo , i felt so uncomfortable , because of their attitude and body langue I’ve worked at fast food places I understand if your not having a good day but you don’t treat customers like that<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1594132264615, 'text': "We’re sorry to hear you didn't have the best experience with our team, Karen.

This place has terrible customer service, I called to have an order changed and was rudely hung up on by a girl named lily . my order still came wrong. I ordered no rice or fajitas and both were on it. Lily if you dont like your job get a better one, its not the customers fault you work there.</Text>

<text>They SUCK at folding burritos!!! And they don't even care!!! They don't even offer to fix it or adjust the price whatsoever!! When I had to point it out, because God forbid they admit it, they said, "it's fine, most of the food is in there". Avoid this place, go next door to Waba Grill or Jersey Mike's. Least they have respectable customer service at those places.< /text>< name>

This is the best Chipotle ever.  Sharon is the Manager at this Chipotle and she always gives me free chips.
Without the free chips I think it's worth 1 star. And they don't open up past my bedtime.<//text>

It’s a hit or miss sometimes you’ll get a good portion of food, out of the 5 times I’ve been here 2 out of 5 I’ve gotten a good portion the other 3 well not so good. I get it most likely you won’t get a good portion of meat but when even you a very little rice beans and any other ingredients that’s when you should question it.< /review>

<Text>For recently opening it is the worst customer service I have ever received. They don't have certain meats ready, when I ask for more lettuce they give me a dirty face, the cashier's are rude. Overall I wouldn't recommend this location of chipotle to anyone! This place needs training in customer care. I work for a hospital near by and I will not be recommending this location to my colleagues.< /Text><Date>1520634850668</Date></record>

The best Big 5 Sporting Goods store is in Yorba Linda, CA. Staff here are extremely helpful and have the best customer service I've experienced, especially during the holidays and during their sales. They pretty much always have what my kids need for soccer and baseball. I can usually find quick little gifts here too. This store is fully stocked, especially during their sales. There's always plenty of parking too, very spacious plaza for this location in Yorba Linda. Thank you for your excellent customer service! You guys are the best!</text>

Terrible customer service, the employee at the shoe area was attempting a female, as a courtesy I didn't interrupt them. When they were done he passed by me without acknowledgement. I guess I was the wrong type of customer for this store.< /Text>

<text>Good convenient smaller sporting goods store when you just want to run in and get something without the big "experience" of going to Dick's.

Good sale prices on shoes. Limited sizes available, but always good to check Big 5 for things like hiking boots. They also have tons of coupons out there for $10 off a $30 purchase. It's a good deal.<//text>< pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Always helpful staff. Looked for a pair of walking shoes and I enjoyed browsing a nice selection. Even though this is the closest sport store to the house, for some reason it is not my first thought.  The merchandise selection is good, service fantastic, quality is fine name brand stuff.  I am sure I would spend more here if they did a little better marketing.... like the Kohl's Crack wife gets every month along with the BBB 20% off coupons that we have literally 50.</text>< pics>

I only go here when i have a coupon or something on sale. Usually just shoes. Place is crowded with narrow aisles. Certainly not ADA or fire code compliant. Staff are friendly when they are available. This is just a place filled with stuff and 8 just don't want more stuff in my life.< /Review>

Golf putters were very dangerous to look at! They were on a rack above a door and all came down when I removed one to look at it. We got what we came for. It's no Roger Dunn, that's for sure.</text>

Great sparkling wines. I just rejoined their wine club. It's hard to find incredible sparkling wines comparable in your local liquor store. Highly recommended.<//text>

The sparkling whites defy superlatives - the late disgorged 2009 was so phenomenal we can’t wait to buy more. the grounds are lovely, the patio for tasting is delightful. Join the club and enjoy.<//Text>

Absolutely the worst tasting experience we've had in this region.  The wines were dropped off at the table with no explanation after waiting more than 30 minutes for an initial service.  Charcuterie board was dropped off with no discussion about pairing.....After we finished, server came over to ask us if we wanted to buy anything or join the wine club, but then walked off....30 minutes later we left after not seeing her again.  Definitely wouldn't recommend this place!  If you like sparkling, try the prosecco at VJB!  Service is 50 times better!!</Review>

Very picturesque property, worth a visit. At $55 per person entry is a bit too steep just to enter the tasting room even if you are not a wine drinker.</Review>

Excellent view with competent service by the strapping young lad. We had the sparkling wine tasting which paired well with the olives and the charcuterie plate.  Overall a very nice winery experience.</Review>

Decent bubbles , beautiful view, but that's where it stops. I have been to Gloria Ferrer four times. The first time was amazing, which is why I decided to go back. Even though the service wasn't great on my second visit, I decided to join the wine club because I truly enjoyed the wines.

On visit three and four, the service dropped tremendously. Both times, I waited more than 30 minutes for service, despite having a reservation. On the final visit, I had an extremely poor experience and was then charged nearly $60 on a $50 bill due. While it was later explained that this tip was for the "full tasting" (discounted because I was a member), I was never told to expect this upfront, which is very disappointing. This was made more frustrating by the fact that we waited over 30 minutes to be seated, another 20 minutes for service once seated, and over 30 minutes to receive the bill. In fact, I never actually received the bill because we needed to leave, so my final payment was charged to the card on file. When I emailed to discuss my experience, ask about the 120% tip, and ask for club cancellation, no one responded except to cancel my membership. There was no apology or explanation for the poor service, and no one ever followed up.

Much of my frustration (and this one-star review) could've been avoided if someone from Gloria Ferrer had simply explained the circumstances behind the poor experience. Unfortunately, no one found it necessary to do so. I will no longer be going to Gloria Ferrer, and I would never recommend this winery to anyone that I know.< /review>

<text>Great selection of wine flights to choose from, but a little pricey. The view is incredible for pictures and a scenery to enjoy while sipping on wine. Great accommodations for a large group. I do think it is odd that they didn't advertise the interior building or the various things the grounds has to offer. It's more of a sit and sip experience.< /text>< gmapID>

If you’re looking for a spot to sit down and enjoy a flight (as opposed to a tasting) of sparkling wines, this is the place! Spectacular views from the front patio, and a nice change of pace from other wineries where you stand at a counter. Beto (our wine educator) was great and even helped us map out our other stops since it was a last minute trip. We had such a lovely time, we went back again on our second day!<//Review>

Came here on a Saturday morning with a large group - was glad we made a reservation because the winery got pretty crowded! The tasting was fun and the portions were generous. The staff was friendly and helpful. I tried the chocolate pairings - there were some interesting flavors (apricot and pomegranate for example). Great views from the winery.</Text>

<text>Unfortunately our experience was incredibly poor. We were hopeful because the venue sits on an amazing vineyard with great views. The charcuterie board and wines were just ok. Honestly thought the wines were super bland. The food was dry and stale. And to top of off we were smelling manure the entire time. Service was average.< /text>< gmap_id>

I have been a fan for years and went back to visit and support this winery during Covid in mid October with my husband, daughter and her boyfriend. How disappointed we were in  the service! It took forever to get our beverages and our server was clearly tired and stressed out. She spent no time describing what we were drinking. When making reservations we had to buy a cheese board for each member of the party (4) and I also was charged for the tastings even though we are members. I am all about supporting the wineries during this difficult time, but it was just not a pleasant experience and I felt like we were taken advantage of. It was explained briefly by our server that it was a tip or something like that, but honestly she did not deserve much of a tip. I hope it was just a bad day (it was very hot).  Thinking of cancelling our membership.< /Text>

<Text>This place was a little too commercial for my tastes, but with that comes some really nice things, like a nice big patio where groups can gather and enjoy a tasting and an excellent charcuterie plate. And wines paired with chocolates. And a bunch of different wine flights to choose from for your tasting. And so if you can get over it being busy and people bringing their children to a wine tasting and just enjoy the wines and the views, its a rather pleasant place to visit.<//Text>< Pics>

Great views. Specialize in sparkling wine. Aimed more towards groups and busses, large groups, wine clubs, etc. If you're looking for boutique sonoma wine this isn't the place for you but if you want a nice patio to hang out on while sipping some bubbles and eating local cheese and wine this is the spot.</review>

Added this stop last minute on our way to Napa. We spent an hour on their nice terrace with amazing views, trying their best selling sparkling wine and charcuterie platter which was really good. We didn’t have a reservation, but were seated right away. I would recommend adding this to your itinerary if you have one hour to spare. The only downside really were the non-alcoholic options for the DD that weren’t that many.< /text>

Stars for the sparkling wine and the view... Very nice. However three stars removed for the following problems:  In this era of technology how it is it not possible to provide separate bills or at least separate totals for each couple? Why did the server not want to even print the bill until we paid her? After we insisted in seeing the bill we understood. One of our party had purchased a bottle of wine to take with him (unopened/not served... and we were told we had to purchase it from the server). On the final bill we noted that a 20 percent tip was  include in the total (that's fine. We routinely leave 20 percent). However the 20 percent tip was also added to the bottle of wine that was simply purchased and put in a bag. The whole payment process was an amazing hassle!!! Our group won't return again.<//text>

This place had all the makings of a great winery experience. We are members here and despite that the only time we had good service was on our first visit. Unfortunately, the next three visits consisted of long wait time to be seated even though we had an appointment, being utterly ignored during our tasing, and having a $50 dollar tip “auto added” to our $60 bill. This place has been a continual disappoint after our first visit. We would highly recommend the other bubbles houses in Napa and Sonoma. Better quality wine and service.<//Text>

Beautiful wines, great views and excellent service. Lovely place to sit and have some delicious local cheese and a cold glass of bubbles. Can get busy on weekends but the wait for us was less than 15 mins for a table.< /Text>

After getting seated we waited up to 15 minutes to be served all while watching waiters serve tables that were seated after us and completely ignore us trying to get their attention. No one ever came over to our table. We left without being served and when we raised the issue to the staff on our way out they said “oh we are sorry about that” and nothing else. Absolutely disgraceful customer service and would not recommend.</Review>

<Review>I came for a visit from Oregon and felt like a Queen. Their food plates were amazing and I was knocked out by their Pinot Noirs (There are 4-5 of them.) I am not a huge champagne fan but the group I was with is. So I was super pleased to taste their yummy reds.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

My partner and I just made it in before last call!

Beautiful entrance to the winery with a nice long drive through the vineyard. The tasting room is beautiful inside. We sat on the patio out back, which has amazing views of the valley. They provide blankets to bring outside on the patio, which was perfect as it was still chilly!

The wines were great, and even brought a bottle to take home.

Will return!<//Review>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>We visited on a Saturday and the winery was crowded and hosting multiple very loud parties. It felt like they wanted to make a lot of money and were less concerned about making it a nice experience for their customers (unless you were at one of the  parties). We got seated quite quickly but we were right at the back of the patio next to one of the large parties which was disappointing. They didn't ask if the table was OK for us. They don't allow you to purchase bottles of wine or split the bill with other members of your party, which we felt was uneccessarily restrictive and customer unfriendly.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<review>What a beautiful vineyard! Their tasting room have outside seating overlooking some of their vines. Although it was January, our visit to Gloria Ferrer was a lovely day. We sat outdoors and enjoyed a flight of bubbles with cheese and charcuterie.

It really pays to know a member. All the flights were complementary.

Edit 11/19
Not sure if everyone can experience this, got to attend a dinner event at their cave. Beautiful and one of a kind experience.<//review><GmapID>0x8085af45826baf41:0xdab0877f31fbb3e0< /GmapID>< name>

< Review>
Pretty, yet tranaactional.  Wish I could give it more stars... The view from the tasting room is fantastic and the cuvee is superb. Unfortunately it also felt like they knew this fact enough to overcharge for a small group tasting which was in fact just a run of the mill restaurant experience with slow service and impersonal feeling.  I'm told they have some nice wine caves, maybe that's the draw?< /Review>

Beautiful views. Crowded in the weekends, especially during 'wedding season'. Come early or come during the week, and opt for the patio...unless the wind is bringing the smell of the farm next door to mingle with your  palatte. A very pretty property.</review>

<Text>We took the tour and really enjoyed our experience. The property is beautiful and they have a wonderful terrace. We visited a few other wineries in the same day and enjoyed our experience here much more. The people are so nice and so respectful. I felt very comfortable here and the atmosphere was very laid back and fun. I would recommend this place to anyone who is new to the California wine country and you love sparkling wine.</Text>< pics>

Gloria Ferrer Sparkling is excellent on it's own or to pair with your favorite foods.  The Sparkling enhances any dish you are serving.   The view from the terrace is breath taking.</Review>

Their wine selection was good. We had their Pinot and bacon pairing, however, the wine was served close to ten minutes after the bacon. We also did not receive any napkins until we asked, and then were given thin cocktail napkins. When you order food, especially finger food like a cheese platter, napkins should be a part of the setting. I shouldn't have to ask and one tiny napkin for each person is a little ridiculous. For a location that seems to always have a high volume of traffic their service left something to to be desired.< /review>

Drinks were, of course, fantastic, and the cheese and olive plates were delicious and very reasonable priced. Speaking of which, their black olives were incredible, I've never had any as flavorful.

Decent bubbles. The brut rose is the best of the reserved flight ($30). Ask for seconds and thirds of the roasted almonds. Grab a seat outside and enjoy the gorgeous view! You can also grab bread, cheese, pate or other snacks to enjoy while you sip. I love this option at a winery. Genius!</Review>

Views were great as we sat out back on the patio.

Unfortunately, I would not recommend sitting outside. We had a cheese plate and tasting and THEN THE FLIES CAME.  LOTS of them. It ruined the tasting.  I am pretty sure the flies enjoyed that cheese plate more than we did.

Cheese plate was local cheeses. Were quite good.

Pricey but fabulous. The view can't be beat, the tasting is more like ordering at a restaurant if you sit on the patio, but it's the best seat in the house. The tapas are also excellent and pretty well priced. I really enjoyed the local cheese plate.<//Review>

If you are looking for an education on sparkling wine production with a view, I recommend a visit. Their tour was extremely generous in the amount of wine you got to taste, as well as highly educational. Their grounds are gorgeous and after the tour you can sit out on the terrace and look at the sloping hills of Sonoma. A great way to end a day of wine tasting.<//text>

Great sparkling wines. Views from the patio overlooking the Sonoma Valley. Prices are very reasonable. A must stop for anyone visiting Sonoma or Napa.</review>

We stopped here on our way back to San Francisco.  The drive through the vineyards was beautiful and what we wanted to see.  We were told that to go in you would have to be on a tour and we just didn't have the time for that.< /text>

< Review>
We have come here 3 times so far, and have loved it each time. An excellent place for lovers of sparkly wines. Service has been very good with friendly and attentive waiters, and the building and the grounds are very nice with a wonderful expansive view from the terrace.

Food offerings are relatively simple for the most part but nice and tasty. They include cheese boards and charcuterie plates. They could upgrade and offer freshly baked bread instead (would love some baguettes), but at least the cheese and charcuterie are all very tasty and a good match for the wine.

Tasting flights are 3 x 2oz and cost around $ 25 to $ 35. You can also buy wine by the glass which is around $9-13 per glass. So it may actually be better value to buy individual glasses.

You can also buy bottles to go (and probably to drink as well), with prices ranging from around $20 for a very nice blanc de noirs to up to $80 or more, with the average being around $40-50.

We love this place and their excellent sparkly wine and will return again, no doubt!</Review>

Amazing! Took a tour with Yaneli and she was awesome! They have delicious wines and I'd highly recommend the tour as you learn a lot about the process, and the level of knowledge and effort required to produce a globally recognized brand.<//Text>

<review>We've been visiting Gloria Ferrer's for about 16 years, celebrating special events and enjoying their champagne. We've been members in their club and often buy their champagne. Today we were so disappointed that when we arrived with out of town company and were treated rudely. We had walked out to the 'members only' deck (which was open to all the last time we had been there.) We were greeted with, "What do you want?" Even after we apologized for not knowing about the changes, the greeter continued to be rude to us.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>Gorgeous view elegant sparkling wine. But rude service.  We are from tx. Arrived at winery at 1640.  Web site states closing time is 1700.  Staff rudely announces .. You got 30 secs.  We were so excited to get here.  That ruined the experience and really kept me from buying bottles.  Waitress then was nice.  I guess trying to make up.</Review>< Name>

<review>Gloria Ferrer is the place to be in Sonoma Valley if you love champagne. We did the food and sparking wine pairing- a light lunch but a lot of fun if you take the time to savor each bite and enjoy each wine. The views are amazing and worth the drive. On top of this, the staff was amazing and knowledgable about the wines.

Our hostess was wonderful and went above and beyond to help us understand sparkling wines a bit better. She was passionate about her job and it showed.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><gmap_id>0x8085af45826baf41:0xdab0877f31fbb3e0</gmap_id>< time>

Amazing 1st stop or last stop on the way in or out of Sonoma!  The hilltop view of the valley & marsh lands is beautiful and made even better over a bottle of sparkling wine at sunset.  The outdoor patio is rich with flowers and the accompanying hummingbirds which both mesmerize and enchant wine drinkers of all varietals...  Great deals on a bottle and complimentary spiced nuts are the norm but they offer far more in the way of great cheese and meat trays to delight all.</text>

Terrible experience, we walked out. Way too many people for the amount of servers. We were sat right away (no bar tastings, you had to have a table) and waited 15 minutes and never had a server come to our table even though servers were coming to tables right next to us. In addition their tastings were extremely expensive. Don't waste your time or money.<//Text>

It was a beautiful view and amazing morning.  Not worth the Wine Tasting! ! Felt like they where annoyed that there was 7 in our party, wine not worth $35.00 for only 3 flights.  we all decided not to buy!< /review>

Before facing the dreaded city-bound traffic, it makes sense to enjoy a glass of sparkling wine on the patio at Gloria Ferrer. The views over the Carneros district are pleasant. Last time I went, the tasting was free with a VISA Signature card.</Text>

I've been to the winery a few times. The first was a busy weekend during the summer, the second was a slow weekday last week. Both times I was impressed with the views and the price of the sparkling wines for the quality.

This is a really popular winery and it gets busy for a reason. It's located on the way to Sonoma/Napa, it's up on the hill with amazing views and the patio is a great place to sip sparkling. We plan on going again.< /Text>

Terrible staff....beautiful area but staff would not even let us look around...saying " staff is carrying glasses so dont get in rheir way"  Definitely avoid this place and do not buy their wine.  So many other great and deserving places in Sonoma...NOT THIS ONE!< /text>

We had a most wonderful time at Gloria Ferrer last Sunday. The bubblies are wonderful and their Pinot Noir’s are amazing (I come from Oregon, land of the amazing Pinots and they are competitive to these!) Jessi, our server, is da bomb! Love every thing about this place including the lovely hummingbird and lizard that paid us a visit.< /Text>

I typically don't like sparkling wines. Then, I found Gloria Ferrer. They plant pinot and chardonnay grapes to make their sparkling wine. I have discovered that I love the pinot blends of bubbles thanks to GF.
Tip: Stop off here to have a nice glass on the porch. It over looks the beautiful valley. Also, if you join the wine club, tastings are free anytime. Cheers!< /text>

Beautiful venue (though a bit touristy) with great cheese and charcuterie plates. Nice sparkling wines from a family that has a deep history of cava-making in Catalonia Spain. Not a huge fan of the Chardonnay and Pinot Noir from their flight menu.< /text>

<text>Gloria Ferrer was the last venue on our 4-day adventure to Napa and Sonoma. It was a "bucket list" trip for my sister and me. She lives in Las Vegas and I live near Boston and we have always been fans of Gloria Ferrer! Of all the vineyards we visited, Gloria Ferrer was the only one where took advantage of the tour. We were not disappointed in any way! Our tour guide, Tom, was cordial, accommodating knowledgeable and possessed a great sense of humor. Everyone we encountered at Gloria Ferrer, e.g. service personnel, tour guide and staff were amazing! I asked for a bag of ice to chill a bottle on the ride to San Francisco and the clerk was more than happy to provide the ice, albeit in a trash bag! Necessity is the mother of invention!
We loved everything about Gloria Ferrer: the vistas, the staff, the tour, the knowledgeable guide, Tom, the cheese plate and the history of this fascinating property. If heading to Napa Valley / Yountville / Sonoma, make sure Gloria Ferrer is at the top of YOUR bucket list!</text><GmapID>0x8085af45826baf41:0xdab0877f31fbb3e0</GmapID>< Time>

Fabulous tasting space with panoramic views ranging from mountains to vines and even a touch of water.

I could see others struggle for wick service around me but I was services extremely well by Roberto despite the busy patio.

Retractable awning makes it the best setting for an after hours tasting.

Ahh yes, and the new Blanc de Blanc release is a delicious sparkling wine.</Text>

I like Gloria Ferrer because you can do your tasting while seated at a table outside, allowing you to leisurely enjoy the view of the valley and vineyards instead of stuck inside, standing at a bar, staring at the wall. The Va di Va sparkling wine is amazing here--- it is so much better than anything else I've tried. I really wanted to buy a bottle, and in hindsight I should have, but it's such a pain traveling with alcohol. Visa Signature gets you two pre picked free pours. Awesome way to end a day of wine tasting. If I had more time in Sonoma, I would come here early on a warm day and just spend hours staring out at the valley, sipping on Va di Va and eating some cheese! Also love how clean and modern this place is. The bar inside is gorgeous and the bathrooms and overall decor of this place is beautiful.< /text>

Pricey, but worth it for the views. Wine is good, and the cheese plate was a generous portion.<//Text>

<Review>My wife and I were down in California doing some wine tasting in the Sonoma region. We found Gloria Ferrer from the VISA Signature Cardholder promotional guide. Under the guide wineries have the option to list benefits they will provide VISA signature card holders. On the guide it clearly stated that this place would offer complimentary wine tasting for cardholders, as opposed to discounts or other promotions that were also listed for various establishments on the guide.

We drove way out into the countryside to get there. They do NOT have a tasting room in the city, at least not that they advertised to us. When we got there it was a huge sprawling estate with several tour buses in front. I almost left then as it seemed like a typical cash-cow operation, much like you'd see over in neighboring Napa. However, since it was a very long drive to get there we decided to go inside.

Once inside we went to the "bar" and asked about tasting. An older gentleman that I would later find out to be named "Gary" informed us that there was a mistake, that there were no complimentary tastings for the VISA signature program and that all they offered were discounts, which were also listed on the brochure that I handed to him. Rather than argue with him we left. I phoned management and spoke with a woman who did not seem to understand my problem, so I was escalated to a guy named Dennis who left me a voice-mail.

On returning home from California I returned Dennis's call to ask him what he would do. Instead he kept asking me what I wanted him to do... He said he would speak to "Gary" and make sure it didn't happen again. Apparently they DO offer complimentary wine tastings to people but in a different manner, usually a larger tasting of a single wine rather than smaller pours of many wines. However, we did not get that.

I asked Dennis what he normally did in these situations and he said they usually comp. parties for their wine and give them a bottle to go home with. I explained I was not satisfied with him apologizing and he did not offer anything to me. I did not feel comfortable asking for anything since I did not want him to think I was trying to shake them down for free stuff. It was a very awkward conversation.

In summary, I do not recommend this place. In Dennis's own words, they are used to getting 700+ people a day on large tour buses. Avoid this cash-cow operation like the plague. I also plan on contacting VISA and letting them know about this.

If you are interested in wine tasting in the Sonoma area and/or you are part of the VISA signature program, then hit one of the other 70+ wineries participating. In all we only found 3 with problems and only 1 non-compliant. Many of them are small family-run wineries that are more interested in you as a person than you as one of 700+ walking money-bags that they can fleece for cash.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

(Translated by Google) It is a place that if I recommend it, I had a very nice experience, with wine, cheese, etc etc.

<pics>None< /pics><review>(Translated by Google) The worst experience of my life!
The awful service, starting with the host, told us that we had to wait 15 minutes to sit down and at the end we waited about an hour! That did not matter to us, but we had to go and ask why they were not sitting and it turned out that they had already crossed off the list. Well, in the end the host with bad attitude took us to a table and asked to move to the terrace, she told us that afterwards we could not change our mind, which is fine, we understood! But he sat us down at a dirty table, took us the menus later when he surely remembered that he had to take them, no waiter came at any time to ask us about the drinks! I do not know if it was because they saw three young girls and they thought we would not have money to pay! Or who knows why ... But I honestly take a big disappointment, the place is beautiful! But the people who work there leave a lot to be desired, hopefully and service a little better the attitude and want to help the clients in some way.

(Original)
La peor experiencia de mi vida!
El servicio horroroso, empezando por las host, nos dijeron que teníamos q esperar 15 minutos para sentarnos y al final esperamos alrededor de una hora! Eso no nos importó, pero tuvimos que ir nosotras a preguntar por qué no nos sentaban y resulta q ya nos habían tachado de la lista. Bueno, al final la host con mala actitud nos llevó a una mesa y le pedimos cambiarnos a la terraza, ella nos dijo q después no podríamos cambiar de idea, que lo cual está bien, lo entendimos! Pero nos sentó en una mesa sucia, nos llevó los menús después cuando seguramente recordó q tenía q llevarlos, ningún mesero se acercó en ningún momento a preguntarnos por las bebidas! No se si era porque veían a tres chicas jóvenes y pensaron q no tendríamos dinero para pagar! O quien sabe el por qué.... Pero sinceramente me lleve una gran decepción, el lugar es precioso! Pero la gente q trabaja allí deja muchísimo que desear, ojalá y el servicio mejor un poco la actitud y desee ayudar de alguna forma los clientes.</review>< Rating>

I'm only giving them 3 stars because they made me feel like I was in a swapmeet, how they follow you where ever you go like you're going to steal. Good shoes though but stop profiling people based on looks not all people are the same.< /review>

great place to get shoes for the whole family.! also great prices.!! & there are ALWAYS great sales.! I walked in & found an amazing pair of boots, the price tag said $100 but it was bogo so my hubby bought some shoes too, we had a coupon for 20% off & there was also a discount for having a certain amount of items...I payed just $10 for the $100 boots.!! 😍< /review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><pictures>None</pictures><Review>Five Stars for Roger at this Famous Footwear. I'm not sure if he is the manager here but I hope he goes a long way. His kindness & patience was very professional. A young employee made a mistake with an online order & after 3 weeks of waiting for my shoes; I came back to this location to ask about my purchase. I think it turned out she never actually ordered them so I was waiting for nothing. She ordered them in the wrong size too, but ! Roger was awesome. 10/10, A+, 100%. He deserves a round of applause. These Five Stars are for him.

My Famous Footwear experience definetly could have gone differently but I was so happy to have Roger turn my day around. A big thank you and I love my new shoes!<//Review>< date>

<review>Young lady employee was very helpful. But the Manager seemed too busy to help.  I had a question for a specialty shoe and when the employee confronted the manager he seemed like he was too busy to help. He was short with his answers did not give options. And he was not even helping anyone else. Visit took place on June 7th.< /review>< Date>

Service lacked, that's the story.
Some prices were not bad.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>Pretty good selection of shoes. Can usually find them cheaper on amazon. But they offer buy one get one 1/2 off a few times a year. They also ship to you if they don't have your size.</review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I always come to this location even though I live a little farther. The food here WAY better than all the other Canes. At least to me, lol! The food here is so tasty and they are definitely not shy with their sauce. I say this because in other locations, I only get a dot of sauce in my sandwiches and a small amount in the containers - not here. Also, the employees are always very nice and mind you, this place gets SLAMMED. Yet they are always composed and courteous even in stressful situations. So yes, this Canes deserves 5 stars 🌟🤩< /review>< pics>

<Review>The service is EXCELLENT! The employees were amazing explaining the menu and offered samples, which were so great and generous! The restaurant itself a super adorable hole-in-the-wall with affordable options. The food was TREMENDOUS and such a great find! I got medium spice which was already plenty spicy, so heads up.</Review><username>Sharon Summers<//username></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Parking can be an issue, but I personally love Canes chicken tenders. Best tenders from any fast food restaurant. Good service to and they always say some sort of Chicken based pun or saying at the drive through when you order. Order some chicken, more chicken, or a lot of chicken cuz that's what they have and it's good.<//Review>

Love this place and I am not a chicken lover at all but they make it so good. Best part is you can not beat the hours. Open until 3am plenty of time to make it after work when you get the Munchies.<//Review>

<Date>1601672781590<//Date><name>胡子恩（Daniel Hu）</name><text>Thank you Jesus for this chicken! This is one of the best chicken I had after the pandemic. When I dip this chicken into their amazing sauce and put them into my mouth, I praised Hallelujah to the Lord God Almighty! This Louisiana cuisine is SO GOOD!! I loved the tenderness and juiciness of the chicken finger, the freshness of the crinkle-cut potato fries, the taste and quality o the dipping sauce, DELICIOUS COLESLAW and Texas Toast, and also the FRESH SQUEEZED LEMONADE WITH CANE SUGAR!!!! I usually don't take fountain drinks, but this one is exception....It has nothing chemical, all fresh!!! And when put together with the meal, it is truly amazing!!!! I highly recommend this place, but please note that order inside and take out is faster than drive-thru if you see more than 3-5 cars before you! Oh and by the way, I love their new trademark "ONE LOVE"...YES JESUS IS THE ONLY ONE I LOVE!!!< /text>< Response>

Now if you go the extra mile and add the Louisiana hot sauce, you have a mouth watering flavor. This place is an excellent value, for the amount of food that you get. Parking during lunch time and in the evening is tight. So prepare to use the drive thru window, and don’t forget the lemonade.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>I was hesitant to go for years thinking it was similar to kfc. But after giving it a try with my kids we love it. Love the taste of the chicken, definitely on our goto list of places for those monthly fast food nights. Im not a big fan of the fries or toast but my kids really seem to enjoy them.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Well if your a chicken finger lover then this is the place for you.the food is great not a very big menu but it's finger licking good.the serves is great they get you in and out as fast as they could .the only bad thing about this place is the location . There at the corner with a very small parking lot ,there's some days when the line of cars is backed up into the street,it might take a little more time to get your food but it's well worth it.<//review>< Pics>

<review>It's good chicken & coleslaw.  Fries of this kind you get anywhere.  Their dipping sauce is also ok.  I was lucky to pass by when there wasn't a line so yeah, that's when I made a u turn from in N out and opted for Chicken well done.  📒✍</review>< rating>

<Text>Service was fast and ordering was made easy by one of the employees, Dylan. Dylan made the process of ordering and receiving my food so much better and is such a genuine person. I really appreciate Dylan’s upright attitude and how easily he displayed his friendliness and kindness towards my father and I. He deserves a raise. Thank you to all the staff at this location :)< /Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I love chicken strips, and this place does them very well. And their house sauce for dipping is the best sauce, full stop. I could drink it. But we're not here just for the sauce, right?

The chicken: cooked well, tastes fresh. Sometimes it has been a little dry, but in the same way that occurs when you leave it in the deep fryer a tad long. I've only had it that way a couple times, but beyond that it's been moist and perfect.

Fries: crinkle cut fries are my jam... And these are pretty good, but could use a crispier exterior.

The toast: every combo comes with this thick, buttery toast. It's tasty and a nice addition.

The ice: they have crushed ice, which is scientifically proven to make sodas more enjoyable.

Raising Cane's isn't from around here, and it definitely feels like it. In a good way. It's just a pleasant change of pace. Great place and you gotta try it!</review>

For those with dairy allergies, the sauce and the breading of the chicken are dairy free - love Raising Cane's for this!

If you can snag a parking spot, I'd recommend going inside; it's faster than waiting in the drive thru. Workers all wear masks and gloves. Takeout only.

Remember to get extra sauce!< /Review>< pictures>

Canes always the best go to quick food, which can be saying a lot when it is always next to an inn n out, and chick fil a.

If you don’t like the canes sauce i suggest you try their honey mustard.</Text>

On my first drive through visit, my order was incomplete but I didn’t know until I got home.  I’m not close so didn’t want to go back but I did call to let them know. Oscar, Manager, was very sorry & offered me a free meal on next visit.  When I returned, they honored it and added drinks.  Kudos to Oscar & his team!

The staff is always friendly and I can tell they are working hard.  My g’kids love their chicken so I’ll be going back.</text>

The chicken fingers at Cane's is perhaps the best in town in terms of tenderness, texture and taste given that they are fresh and not overcooked. Apparently some locations do tend to slightly overcook their chicken that completely ruins the dish.< /text>

One of the new favorites! Not a huge fan of fast food, but this is one of my exceptions - especially during this crazy time during the virus when so much is closed or closing early!  Drive thru is always busy, but they seem to be efficient and the chicken was still hot and tasty once we got it back home. And open super late - amazing!</Review>

5 stars because for what they do they have it down perfectly. That said, it would be nice to see some more options... However, if you are attempting to satisfy an insatiable craving for chicken tenders then you have found taste bud heaven! I love the sauce too. Everything seems very freshly made, and be that true or not, it all tastes great. Also, unlike most fast food the chicken is not too salty. Still salty, but not too salty. Clean and friendly service too. Dependable craving quencher.<//text>

Good chicken but I don't see why they are so popular and have so many locations.  Decent sauce but not many options.< /text>

Good food but though it was 9:30, they close the door to go inside for order with the excuse that we close the door at 10:00. I am like it's 9:30 now...30 min to go... Still you won't let me inside<//review>

<Review>Important!: I purchased food from this location in early February 2020.

While my wife and I were driving cross country from Maryland to California, we saw many Raising Cane's locations, especially in Tennessee. I found there was one not that far from where I now live in Orange County, California, and I thought I would give it a try.

The first thing is they only have a few combos on their menu depending on how many chicken fingers you order. I ordered the 3 Finger Combo, which consists of chicken fingers, 1 cup of Cane's sauce, fries, and Texas toast. You can make substitutions if you choose. Their chicken fingers were surprisingly great! They were tender and moist and the breading was seasoned perfectly. Even though it is fast food, they were not too oily. You should definitely dip them in the Cane's Sauce.

I have never seen a fry I do not like, and I was quite happy that they were served with crinkle fries. It worked well with the chicken tenders. I was happy that the combo included the Texas Toast also.

I was happy that I stopped here. The employees were friendly and helpful, and the food was delicious.</Review><rating>5<//rating>< gmap_id>

<Text>1st time going to this eating establishment and it won’t be the last. Very clean and very nice people working here during rush hour lunch time today!  Although I’m visiting for work and I live in Georgia I will definitely eat at the one near my house!  Thanks for the excellent service!< /Text>< gmapID>

I love this place. Lunchtime is the busiest time here. The secret to beating the traffic is to call first to place your order. At that point you can go aroundnthenlimes and walk to the door a pick up your order.</review>

Besides the food is AAA they've even gotten better will there service during this crisis.  Thumbs up all around. Drive thru was around the next building and I was in and out within 15 minutes.< /Text>

First timer, even though a lot of friends have been telling me to go for quite some time. Why on Earth did I wait so long???  Without a doubt, the best chicken fingers I've ever had. And that little piece of toasted delicious bread in the box..melt in your mouth delicious! Oh...and the sauce for the chicken fingers...yum! I also dipped my fries in it! I don't eat fast food often, but I'm definitely coming back here!!!<//review>

Bland fried chicken, sauce helped. Lemonade didn't have much taste. Coleslaw was not that great. Fries were squishy and bland as well. No healthy options available. Don't plan on going again and don't recommend.</text>

Nope. Nice people, but surprisingly not very good. Eat the chicken without the sauces and you'll see what I mean.</review>

<Review>I love this place! Even though it's Fast Food, it's GOOD Fast Food! The drive thru line may SEEM long, but they are quick and the food is hot & fresh. While I was in Irvine, I was working long hours, and some nights Canes was the only place open and the first time I ate there, I was pleasantly surprised! So good that I went back 3 times during my stay!

Staff were always friendly and helpful! I wish they had these in Florida!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures></record>

Apart from tasting great, what is truly amazing is the speed of service. We arrived as about car 20 in the car line and were out of there with our food in about 10 mins.<//Review>

I love this place! Even though it's Fast Food, it's GOOD Fast Food! The drive thru line may SEEM long, but they are quick and the food is hot & fresh. While I was in Irvine, I was working long hours, and some nights Canes was the only place open and the first time I ate there, I was pleasantly surprised! So good that I went back 3 times during my stay!

Staff were always friendly and helpful! I wish they had these in Florida!<//Review>

Always SO good, quick service, no surprises. I mean they serve chicken fingers with bread and fries, what else do you want in life? Love the dipping sauce and honestly, have not been to a Raising Cane's where the quality is not the same all around (from Ohio to Nevada and now California). Went during lunch rush hour and everything was fast, hot and ready to go. Super satisfying!<//Review>

Food is always tasty, personally I would like to have a little more chicken for my buck. But you can't always get what you want business has to make money to.< /text>

Simply put, the best chicken fingers you can get! Juicy and flavorful. The fries and Texas toast are also very good. You can't go wrong with a meal from Raising Canes!!< /Text>

<review>bad service in general, didn't explained about no sauces if ordered without combo, I mean whom would order 20 pcs without needing the sauces? And all staffs were poorly trained towards unhappy customers, even so called manager didn't have the right attitude towards what obviously needed to be correct through their own operation. My orders don't mean much to them but I will never go again.< /review>< pics>

While the food is you're standard fried chicken.. then we were here they were slammed. But the young guy behind the counter was so nice and friendly.

Ask what could've been a normal visit to cane's, the extra star wars because TNT staff was awesome.</review>

I love canes! Sometimes, it's worth the drive to get it because I crave their tender chicken and bread!

pros: chicken strips are very juicy and seasoned well, not too salty or overpowering, bread is buttery and complements chicken well

cons: sometimes the fries aren't that fresh or can be too soggy, and at times, the bread can be too oily sometimes (it's a hit or miss)

But overall, really like their chicken fingers here and the combination of chicken fingers, fries, and bread really does make a solid delicious meal!</Review>

Raising canes is 10/10 in my book. But this location isnt so good. Constantly get my order wrong, and have even had times where i have corrected it and it was STILL wrong. In addition, they undercook the fries and chicken slightly to get it out quicker (or they crowd the fryer bringing the temp down) so it's less crispy than other locations I have been. All in all it's still okay, just prefer other locations if I really want great chicken. (Costa mesa location is the best one)</Text>

The food is fine but the parking lot at this location is the worst. Both times I've come here I couldn't park in the lot. You can only enter from El Toro to get to 90% of the spots.<//Review>

food is fresh and good, BUT it's WAY too hot! my poor kids burnt their mouths. waited 15 minutes and the food was still too hot to eat. I brought it to the managers attention but they didn't seem to care. they need to be careful with serving extremely hot food to people, especially kids.< /text>

Ummm... Disappointed. Not sure if this is because of growing up with homemade fried chicken so my taste buds expected some seasoning. Co-workers used to rave about this being th best chicken in town but I have to question my co-workers food palette from here on out 🥴< /Review>

They have an incredibly simple menu: chicken, toast, fries, and tea. Prices are reasonable and you certainly get enough food with the 3-4 piece combo. Don't forget you can substitute your side of coleslaw for another Texas toast. I suppose my major complaints would be the lack of biscuits, and how very stingy they are with Cain's special sauce.<//text>< resp>

<text>The visit went well since the restaurant wasn't full at the time that I was there. The only reason it was a four star is that it seemed that some pieces could have been cooked a bit longer in my view. Otherwise it is a great place to eat tasty chicken fingers.< /text>< pictures>

Freaking. Delicious. The chicken and fries are fantastic, and they always come out really fast and really fresh. Get extra Cane's sauce and put a little hot sauce in it; my girlfriend showed me this and changed my entire world. Also, the way that they ask for your order is hilarious and wildly different almost every time.< /Text>

<Review>If you haven't been,go it's the bomb. All they do is chicken strips,that arguably are the best. I actually discovered them in Vegas,long b4 they came Cali. They have this Texas toast that's awesome and an addictive special dipping sauce.  It is named for the owners dog!<//Review>< Pics>

<review>By far one of the best chicken sandwiches you can have I don't know how they do it but every single time I go it taste like the first time I had there sandwich.

This place is super clean, the staff is always helpful and cheery. I always recommend you get the chicken sandwich the sweet tea and of course some fries.

This place gets four stars from me!</review></record>

<text>I ordered with DoorDash . I got a Caniac Combo ,I asked for the bread instead of coleslaw but i still got the coleslaw and no bread , I asked for a sprite but got water instead , and almost no fries .  It was so not worth it . I’ve been getting canes for a while now and I’ve never had a problem with the order but this time I am very disappointed.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

We came here for the same reason as everyone else. We realized it was Sunday and Chick-fil-A was closed. Chicken is actually pretty good, fries are meh, they never give you enough sauce, and just because you put a bun around some chicken fingers doesn't make it a chicken sandwich. Sweet tea was good and they have the best fast food coleslaw.<//Text>

I was having an awful day and I came to canes to help cheer me up. All the workers I had encountered were very friendly and they brightened my day. One worker with brown hair was positive while taking my order and she was very cheerful and helped me when I spilled my lemonade.she told me her name was carsa or something.  Thank you canes!</review>

From the moment I walked in to the time I left I was welcomed and thanked multiple times. It's clean,friendly, right off the freeway and the food is always very tasty at their restaurants. I would recommend for families,quick bite at a very reasonable price. All the other amenities are just a bonus and hard to find these days.< /text>

<Review>Love this place! The chicken is always hot and crispy and the Canes sauce is delicious. It adds an extra kick to the chicken and I use it to dip my bread and french fries in.< /Review><rating>5<//rating>< pics>

Never heard of it before, but it was pretty good.  Reasonable pricing, very large portions and friendly service. The counter man who helped us, Peter, was as gracious and attentive as a waiter in an upscale restaurant.  A good surprise all around!!< /Text>

<Text>This was my second time having Raising Cane's Chicken. It was hot and fresh. The place was very busy. There was no parking available. This store has been here for awhile, but is still very popular. The three piece meal was more than enough for most people. The ice tea can be sweet or unsweetened.  They use the crushed ice, which was a special treat. It was a great experience; we will definitely try our local Raising Cane's<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>It gets super busy here sometimes, so keep that in mind if you want to go during peak hours. Staff is always friendly and accommodating, food is always wonderful, and I always have a good time here. Open super late too so you can stop by here for late night hangouts too. Love it here!<//Review>< Name>

<Text>It was surprisingly good.  The checked tenders were actually tender unlike other fast-food places.  The sauce adds a very nice flavor to the meal.

This was my first time here so I wasn't expecting much out of a fast food restaurant but, it exceeded my expectations.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80dce8f222e70eb5:0x7a1438047cb3666d< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Great food, fast service, _terrible_ drive thru. This is one of the busiest intersections in Orange county. You can enter on northbound Carlota, or westbound El Toro, but if you enter on Carlota, you need to wind thru the lot to get to the back of the drive thru line, which requires cutting *thru* the line. In most cases those in line won't let you, because half the time some jerk just cuts into the line.</Review></record>

Great food, their Texas toast is the best. I always sub the coleslaw for more toast. I wish there was some more options for what kind of spices were on the chicken and their staff is a bit too friendly and happy but nothing that takes away from the experience there.

The chicken is always perfectly cooked, the cane sauce is very good and pairs well with the tenders and combined with the Texas bread and fries you are looking at a huge meal. Something else that all the raising Cane's have is that they are open pretty late. This location is almost a little too tight though so be prepared for some tight manuvering.< /text>

Good food, horrible parking / drive thru arrangement.  Even if you aren’t going through the drive through, be prepared to wait in the line just to park or leave.   Needs a lane painted on the pavement or someone outside directing the flow.  Definitely makes me think twice about coming.</text>

Its fried chicken
... not even great fried chicken. Next to no seasoning, like a Jolibee. Grocery store fried chicken is better. I don't understand how this chain keeps growing.</Review>

Raising Cane's has had a lot of hype. This was my first time dining there and I was slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the chicken and bread were amazing! The only thing I would change is the sauce. The spicy mayo-like sauce was tasty but a little too heavy for me. If they had the sauce selection of Popeyes, this place would take my heart instantly. I would definitely still recommend everyone to try this place as it does have wonderfully breaded fried chicken<//Text>

Did not like this place! It had a very boring menu. Really, Chicken strips and thick french fries? Ugh. Don't restaurants get that we are tired of these items?< /Review>

<text>Great food, their Texas toast is the best. I always sub the coleslaw for more toast. I wish there was some more options for what kind of spices were on the chicken and their staff is a bit too friendly and happy but nothing that takes away from the experience there.

The chicken is always perfectly cooked, the cane sauce is very good and pairs well with the tenders and combined with the Texas bread and fries you are looking at a huge meal. Something else that all the raising Cane's have is that they are open pretty late. This location is almost a little too tight though so be prepared for some tight manuvering.</text>< Pictures>

They serve really good chicken fingers, but the location is not the best.  It's right by the freeway entrance and it's always packed.  Still, a great place for chicken lovers.< /review>

The Texas toast was nice. Though, I've had zero desire to go since. I guess I really just need more variety, so it loses me. A hugely popular chain, and I'm still confused as to why exactly. It's ok.

Good, but not as tasty as Pollo Loco or KFC.  The taste needs to be added by the dipping sauce. I'd also rather have some of the salad side options at Pollo Loco than the fries or a piece of bread.< /Review>

Fast and friendly except the people cleaning the tables from patrons after leaving were very disruptive. They have metal chairs so when they would rearrange the chairs, every time they moved one, they would throw it against the adjacent chair which would make a loud metal hitting metal sound. I took my mom to eat for mothers day and the noise level is already pretty high with the loud music plus the guests that are packed in so being able to still hear the metal clanging noise was very ear piercing. It was the only bad thing<//review>

Saw this on the way home to San Diego from Anaheim. So yummy. We needed a snack. Got the 3 piece and 6 piece combo. The chicken is so fresh. The toast is just the right crunchy and softness. The French fries was nice and crunchy. Not a fan of coleslaw but I tore it up since I was hungry and it was good. Would definitely visit again.</text>

< review>
Ever since I first tried Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers, I've been hooked! No matter which location I go to, it is beyond phenomenal food. The reason I'm choosing this location to offer up my 5-🌟 rating to, is because of the incredible staff.

I'm not sure how I've never known about the secret options before, but just like Alice falling down the whole, or Neo taking the red pill, my world has been completely changed and will never be the same! The staff was incredible and showed me a few tweaks to my favorites that took it to a new level. What were these?? Guess you'll have to go in and find out for yourself, huh?! 😁

Thanks for the great food and great tips!</review>

<text>People seem to be happy working there and obviously the food is great. Couple hours go by and you wish you had just one more piece of chicken. Prices could be better but then what kind of chicken would that be?<//text><Rating>5</Rating><username>William Strunc</username></record>

Insanely busy (Saturday about 730pm) but the food was hot, delicious, and I got a few pieces of extra chicken. Whether by mistake or due to the wait I have no idea but definitely bomb and worth it!<//Review>

It is the In N Out way to do chicken. Which works pretty well if you like their sauce but I don't. It is a peppery-thousand island flavor deal. Also the ONLY sauce they offer. Really??? Why no ranch, BBQ, or honey mustard? when my family wants to go here I stop by Chick-fil-A and get some of their sauces so that I can eat here with my family. Also what is up with the overpriced lemonade? Your lemonade is good not great and charging for lemonade refills is lame. Again I just go to a Chick-fil-A to get a lemonade and then eat here with the fam. Go back there when I'm done to get my drink refilled. Raise your game Canes!!!<//review>

<text>Why do I have to pay for a lemonade refill? Seriously disappointed with the behavior of the staff. I already paid for lemonade... why would I pay an additional 80 cents for a refill? Wish I hadn't spent the money on the lemonade in the first place. Place is trash. BOYCOTT

Really don't see what all the fuss is about. Every table in the restaurant was dirty. I had the chicken sandwich. Chicken and bun were both dry. My wife had the 3 piece meal, same thing, dry chicken. Best part was the Texas Toast. Only one choice of dipping sauce (which they charge for if you want more). Not impressed at all. Won't be back.<//Review>

Prices are not worth the meal received, I figured spending $13 for a basic meal the food would taste great. Next time im going to the store and doing it myself no matter how exhausted I am.< /text>

<Text>Tried this place on a recommendation from a co-worker. It was good and you got a ton of food for the price but I personally am a bigger fan of Chick-fil-a!

This location is also VERY hard to get to unless you are going east.

The staff was friendly and nice about having to do multiple orders because I was ordering for my office. The only thing is they placed each order in it's own bag when I would have rather them place everything in one big bag for ease of carrying out to my car!< /Text><date>1486408927681<//date>< Pictures>

I take the 5 freeway every time I go back home to visit my parents and this location is a stone's throw away from the freeway exit. I had never heard of Raising Cane's until my brother told me about it. I can without a doubt say they have the best Texas toast and chicken fingers I've ever had in my life. The chicken is insanely fresh and juicy, and the toast is buttery and soft. If you like chicken, this is the place to get it.<//text>

Raising Canes are all the same, because of this they're defined by what they do wrong.

My meal has been wrong more than a couple times, and one time they straight up lost my order. The only reason they have more than three stars is because it's Raising Canes and I think they're chicken and canes sauce is delicious.< /Text>

<user_name>Luis P.< /user_name><text>Devin took our order. Nice guy, competent at his job. We ordered the combination with 3 Strips each. First time in the place, and curious as to how it could compare to Chick'Fille or something to that effect, which I think is overpriced and not that great. Order arrived piping hot and the strips look definitely bigger than I seen in a long time in a fast food. Fries were surprisingly tasty, and done almost to fries perfection. The slice of bread, which caught me my surprise but now can see how it complements the meal, nice and soft. Should have tried the coleslaw, which I was told by the family member that suggested the place, that is was a nice option. At first I thought that for 3 Chicken Strips and the $7 plus? we paid, was excessive, but after having this quick lunch, I was happy, and most important, filled for the afternoon duties.
Simple formula done well, now I am desiring to buy this strips individually at around $1.19 each, for the chicken in our case, tasted moist and flavorful. Unexpectedly nice this Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers. Worth revisiting when in the area, for I hear they are not spread out as of yet. 4 Stars.< /text></record></dataset><record>

So 4 stars only because it's not my cup of tea. The food was pretty good and the service was great, but I only "liked" the food. Also, the parking lot at this one is a JOKE! It's so hard to manage, especially since the drive through is ALWAYS busy, so those cars are taking up the entire lot. It's pretty frustrating and the layout of the lot makes very little sense to me.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>I don't know why this place has lines of people waiting for food. I finally went in and got some chicken, sauce, toast and fries. Everything and I do mean everything was just OK and rather bland. There is nothing special about anything. We will not go back. There are too many restaurants in the area that work hard to deliver great tasting food. I'll give my money to them.<//Text><Name>JoJo</Name>< gmapID>

The fries and chicken fingers were decent, but I was not happy with the amount I got for what I paid. The chicken fingers are smaller than the menu led me to believe and my drink was at least 50% ice. Their Texas toast tasted like a plain piece of bread. I probably won't be back.< /text>

Very new, and very popular! Seems like the In N Out of fast food chicken. The staff were super nice, and in the back they cheer when they clear all orders. The chicken and sauce were great, fries were average and the "Texas Toast" was good!</Review>

I love ther chicken fingers.  I do believe a little expensive plus u have to purchase extra sauces if u want more.. that's a little weak.. plus u should carry bbq sauce.. we bring ours when we go.. but they dont carry it.. the chicken fingers I do beleive are some of the best out there... so that's the 5 starts 3 stars for your sauce options and having to pay. The honey mustard sauce is pretty legit though.<//review>

Love love love love love this place especially the dipping sauce I dip everything in it.. My mouth is watering just thinking about it might just get it for lunch today. People there are so friendly and courteous. You order them pay in thebdrive thru and by the time you get the window to pick it it up its right there. Love that no wait time.< /Review>

They do a great job expediting so you won't have a long wait and it is well worth it!  I may be addicted. I'm glad they came out west!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Love love love love love this place especially the dipping sauce I dip everything in it.. My mouth is watering just thinking about it might just get it for lunch today. People there are so friendly and courteous. You order them pay in thebdrive thru and by the time you get the window to pick it it up its right there. Love that no wait time.<//Review>< pictures>

Food is simple but excellent. This particular location is difficult to get in to and is always too busy for its size. Putting up with the limited parking and seating is so worth it though.<//Text>

Fantastic service, and super fast that I often will take my lunch brakes here with is just about a 10min drive each way and will still have the time to eat an incredible meal. This location also has a drive-through, and they are open Sun - Thu 10am - 2am / Fri - Sat 10am - 3am perfect for those late night outings :)< /review>

<text>It's definitely a high fat/fried alternative to Chik-Fil-A. With that in mind, it's pretty delicious. The only problem is the complete lack of sauces. They only have a house sauce. If you are a ranch, BBQ, or other sauce lover, you need to bring your own or get it to go. Parking is also a little nasty.<//text>< Name>

The chicken fingers were ok, so were the fries. But the garlic bread was delicious. The place was  nice and clean, the lemonade refill will cost you $.80 each.</review>

Want a burger? Want a steak? Go somewhere else. Want chicken and fries? You'll find some pretty good ones here. It's loud (music and college kids) and it's a workaraunt (where you have to serve yourself and clean your own table). But if you don't mind that and you like chicken fingers and fries, give it a try.< /review>

Great food, rough location. Parking is a problem. Very awkward to get to it since you can't (legally) turn left to get there. Seating can be a problem during lunch time when it is very busy. Would recommend going to a different larger location (e.g. Aliso Viejo) or go during slower hours.< /review>

<Text>Great food like all of them, way too small inside and nowhere near enough seating, so you get people waiting around watching ypu finish so they can get a seat. Probably the best and quickest drive-thru of all of the locations in Southern California though< /Text></record></dataset><record>

This place is marketed to be high end, and, yes, it's priced that way. The food is okay, but it's not much different than you would find at any other place that serves fried chicken.<//Review>

The location is a bit awkward situated between freeway entrances/exits. There's also really limited parking for this type of business.<//Text>

It's only chicken fingers! Someone came in the other day and was frustrated.

Anyway, Raising Cane's, or Cane's for short, has great chicken. The sauce and bread always complete it and regardless of which one you go to, I have never met a bad employee.< /Text>

Not only is canes abusing their customers trust they have also lowered the quality of their chicken emensley by decreasing the amount of actual chicken in a finger and adding more crisp, also the quality of the cooking oil has gotten worse not only do they charge you extra for lemonade but they also charge for refills and they charge  as much as if you where gonna buy another lemonade shake on them for doing this if I could I would rate 0 stars< /text>

The chicken tasted like cigarettes this time. Wow is was gross. My husband and my son thought the same thing. So we threw it away!  First time having a bad experience at Raising Canes. May it should be called Raising Tobacco!<//text>

<review>great taste and quality but feels overpriced. on this location you have to be careful if coming from north to south since the entrance is the opposite way and the line forms from that entrance.< /review>< gmapID>

Counter service was unfriendly, rude & expressed a "take I it or leave it  attitude.  Tables were mostly dirty, both meals had ever smaller portions of frys.
