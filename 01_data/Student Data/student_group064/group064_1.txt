<Text>I had an awesome experience with Oracle law firm. My case went very smoothly from the day I called the office until the end of my case and getting my settlement done.I didn't have the chance to meet any of this great team because of Covid-19. I definitely recommend this office for any injury case if you want the best that you can get. I want to thank all who answered my calls and give me a great confidence. You are the best.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1626370300588, 'text': 'It was our pleasure to help!

After searching for a lawfirm to help me with workers compensation,  I went with Oracle Law Firm and I am glad that I did. I just wished I hadn't waited so long. After having a bad experience with the company insurance. Thanks to my lawyer I received better treatment. In the end I am very  satisfied with the outcome, got me a reasonable compensation and the opportunity to achieve other goals in my life like going back to school. I definitely recommend this firm to anyone having any difficulties or issues. Also my paralegal Karina was very professional, helpful, informative and answered all my questions.< /Text>

Suing someone is not a pleasant thing to do. And when it concerns your employment, it can be scary. I’m glad that Oracle has handled my case, because I get my questions answered and my fears laid to rest. Stephanie is very responsive and when I let her know that I need to speak to my attorney, Jasmine Keogh, she will arrange a call quickly. Jasmine knows her stuff and gives me potential outcomes based on the law, not just to appease me. My case is going well and if I have another case that needs a firm like this, I won’t hesitate to call them.<//review>

It was a great pleasure working with the Oracle Law Firm. They really live up to their name. Karina was very helpful in assisting with my case. She always kept me updated on everything. My case was in their hands less than 3 months and my case was resolved. I am very satisfied with the outcome of my case. I recommend this office to anyone seeking an office that will really take care of your needs and beyond. Thank you Oracle Law Firm for everything.< /Review>

I hired Oracle Law Firm after falling on a Big Budget film and was hurt and still hurt. My only issue is that I may have been unknowledgeable about where I could see a doctor as ALL of them refused me. I was overwhelmed with paperwork coming from the Workers Comp office and I was told that I didn't have to worry about that and the law office would handle it however I was not receiving medical treatment through workers comp and never got an answer on how to do so making me believe it was better to bare through the pain for the lawsuit and not charge up doctors bills. I was seeing my primary care doctor however those bills were not included in the case because I did not know any better.  I may have seen 4 doctors in 2 years and they were all doctors from the state.

Overall I know 1000% that my case was worth more than I received (I guess I should have called the office and asked more questions everyday being a pain in the butt for 2 years) however,  Suzy, the last Paralegal on my case, was very professional and caring in answering my questions and helping me after the case closed in getting at least what I thought I was agreeing to.

I think this is a great, reputable firm however be proactive in your case or you will lose out on money that should be for you to live more comfortable due to your accident! Do not sign anything without making sure you everything that is stated on the phone is either recorded or in print. Unfortunately due to the pandemic, I believe my case did not receive the attention that it should have nor were the medical records obtained as they should have been but I was afraid to not settle. Never settle anything in a rush!!!

I learned a lesson! Even when you hire a firm you still have to ask questions, demand care and make sure you speak with your paralegal and lawyer about everything involved in the case and make sure ALL of your complaints were taken care of and you visited ALL of the specialists that were ordered before you settle a case. I never saw a neurologist which was ordered and my nervous system is tremendously affected since then and part of that is not being able to focus and organize and understand what was happening. Once you settle there is nothing you can do about it except realize that you got royally screwed!

Hopefully this never happens again as this type of pain and the pain I will have for life as a result is not worth the settlement but if it did I would go back to Oracle but I would know to go to the doctor when I am in pain, don't force myself to go to work when I can barely breath from chest bruising for 3 months and report and record everything! If you do all of  the back end work yourself I think they will do the work in court but you will have to pay attention!! This is my first workers comp case so I don't have another firm to compare it to. I will refer them to family or friends and maybe they can be taken care of fairly knowing what I know now.<//text>

I just got really fed up.  I found Oracle and Attorney Reza on the internet.  Their reviews were great. Their clients expressed they were happy with Oracle's services.  I decided to give them a shot and it turned out to be one my best decisions!

Oracle treated me like I was their only client. They gave me the attention and RESPECT that I deserved. They explained the process and were completely responsive.  They are really hardworking and it showed with my great settlement!! Thank you Oracle! GOD BLESS!</review>< Resp>

I suffered an injury last year and my employer denied me disability payments and doctors cisits. My attorney Fred Ghamari just got me a year worth of disability payments and the insurance finally accepted my case so my payments will continue & I am finally going to get my surgery. Thank you so much for helping me. I tecommend this firm. Thank you Marina and Fred Ghamari<//review>

My case manager was Marina ,she was very nice and helped me through my case process .< /text>

The Oracle Law Firm and Mr. Reza put their client's interests first with efficient and thorough attention to detail to negotiate and achieve the best settlement for the client. They are as transparent as you can get - which is a refreshing characteristic when it comes to the confusing world of law. As a bonus, their friendliness and dedication is beyond compare and really makes any interaction as pleasurable as it can get.

Especially Karina she been with me doing my whole case I was so scared I got injured Dec 2018 from my workplace. I didn't know what to do or how to go about this without getting screwed over by my ex-employer which wasn't any help they left me for dead, and there worker comp insurance wasn't any help they kept saying your a big boy shake it off and get back to work.

I am so pleased 😊🙌🙌🙌. Thank you guys so much I couldn't do it without you. I recommend you to all.. Oracle Law firm won't let you down. They strive to get results..<//text>< resp>

At first everything was going well. Up until the Deposition everything change. I feel as if I was in a hurry to make a  decision. My  attorney  look like he didn’t want to be there and just get over with it. He didn’t give me any feed back but to settle. I really thought oracle was going to fight for me. Never again will I trust them. Or recommend them. It’s sad cause I really didn’t know anything. I feel as I made the wrong choice. But it is what it is.</review>

< Review>
I will say I appreciated them taking on my WC appeal.  However, once settlement talk seriously began and we were reaching the end,  I began to feel rushed.  End result after almost 1 year:  an agreement that left me nowhere close to whole, jobless, and without any future medical. I was encouraged by the Oracle attorney to sign as it was the best one could hope for.  Hindsight makes me think otherwise especially when I weigh in a few mistakes made along the way that should've never happened.  In fact, I brought them to their attention so I wonder about the firm's checks and balances. With it all over, I'm left with just a feeling of "being on the fence" with regard to my personal interactions with Oracle. Would I recommend them to friends/family? Probably not. Would I go out of my way to discourage one who had chosen them? No.  Good luck.< /Review>

<review>On Behalf of David Atencio,

I am incredibly thankful to Oracle Law firm for assisting in my Workers Compensation case. I suffered a horrific accident and they worked their hardest to help me get back on my feet. I was able to get my two daughters through prestigious universities as a single father. Oracle is the right firm, please take my word that these folks will advocate for you beyond the standard that you expect, with hearts that are truly in it. I am very blessed to have them serve me in the manner that they have. Biggest thanks from the bottom of my heart to Fred Ghamari, Maria Rodriguez, Julian Solis, Maria Avila, and Robert Torres.< /review>< pics>

<Review>I can’t express enough how thankful I am to Oracle Personal Injury Law Firm! Right from the very beginning the entire team was very helpful and knowledgeable.

I was sent to the best doctors and someone was always available too assist me. There were so many times I called or may have been an annoying client because I was under so much stress and having emotional breakdowns feelings of being overwhelmed because bills were due or sometime I felt the case was moving too slow for me.
This  team never turned their back on me and always reassured me that everything was okay.
They also explained each process too me from beginning to end.
Last but not least they got me the settlement I deserved!
I will definitely recommend Oracle Personal Injury Law Firm.

Thank you again! Oracle Law Firm

They are honestly the best Lawfirm I've ever gone through. It was my first time getting injured in a work place environment. Of course my old job didn't want to take responsibility and just let me go thinking I dont know any better since I am young but they were wrong! Luckily I did my research and found Oracle Law and right away they helped me tremendously! They kept me updated on my case, they talked to my ex employer when I didn't want to, and they fought for me/believed in me! Because of the hard working people at Oracle Law Firm I won my case and won a settlement! Thank you again to everyone at Oracle Law Firm that helped me with my case. I will most definitely choose Oracle Law Firm again!</Text>< Pics>

Thank you Oracle and Mr. Reza for taking care of me when I needed help. The insurance company was completely ignoring me and trying to close out my claim. Mr. Reza took charge, got me great medical attention and negotiated a great settlement. Thank you so much. I recommend Oracle to anyone who needs good legal counsel.</Text>

(Translated by Google) I take this space to thank all the staff who attended my case, Mr. Alexander, Brenda, Stephanie Torres, and L. Fred Ghamari and each and every one of those who carelessly forgot their names. I feel extremely satisfied with the result obtained by your representation, and the attention received from your very professional team. The promptness with which they resolved in my favor is worthy of admiration, I will always be grateful and recommend them to anyone else who was going through a similar situation. I wish you much success and may God fill you with blessings, always go ahead with your professionalism. Thank you

Eddie Berrios

Met both young& professional ladies that run the office and everything went smooth. Dropped off car, picked up in 4 days & wow! Was a smooth operation as never before! What's convenient is they have a car rental as well, lobby to wait of necessary& clean public restroom!  No hassles, no fooling around, nothing to complain 😉 all positive & great communication from beginning to end!<//text>

< Review>
The final job was ok with some details. The new windshield had a couple of scratches which tells me that the place is not detailed oriented. My side mirror was covered with black glue that I have to clean with a special cleaner.

However I can pass that.

The situation that made me unhappy is that my car was ready on Friday and I was not able to pick it up as I was working. I told customer service that I will do it on Saturday. They told me that they will be open until noon. So I went on Saturday and the body shop was closed. I lost half of my day and I had to rent a new car as I dropped the previous one in the rental car place.

On Monday I didn’t even receive an apology for the mistake. Obviously they don’t really care about good costumer service.< /Review>

<Review>My 2016 Honda Accord was in this shop for a week for a collision repair.I dropped it off last week after I talked to my insurance and referred me to this place. To make the story short my insurance told me to look for Luis Guzman. He is the one that handled my claim and repair for my vehicle. I'm happy the way he handled the process of repairing my car from the  beginning until the end of the process. Thanks Luis.</Review>< Pics>

I took my truck in 4 times because they couldn't fix it write so I spoke to Erica she was in charge of handling my truck repairs so i took it in ones and all they did was wash it!!!!! For what i can afford a car wash the second time  the same my back driver  door was not aligned with the other door and the body so again all they did wash it for me and it took the 3 days!!! Why not sure so finally i took it in again and i had to be specific of what was wrong with my door after i had told them the other 2 times they where too lazy too take of the rubber door stoppers they painted write over them so i told them i wanted that fix water was going i to my cab thru the door the paint didn't match you could still see spots of primer so they tried to buff it out it did not work  so she said to me all call you Monday too set an appointment to drop it off 2 weeks later no phone call  yet so i decided to call her  and she said o i was just going to call you to set a day to drop it of and set you up with a rental  witch she never did so i drop of my truck i never did see her so i called her to ask her about the rental and she send me straight to voicemail so I left her 2 messages and never did call me back I was with out a car for 1 week so i had to miss work and one night they left my truck door open. How do i know that i have a owlcam on my truck it does live streaming and alerts  so i was looking at everything they where doing to my truck very bad service don't recommend this service king and special Erica she's terrible i would no recommend this place go to any other service king beside dis one save the stress and headache.< /review>

Great repair work and Nice paint of rear bumper. My car is very old. The model was stopped production more than a decade ago. So it was difficult to find the repair parts but they did in reasonable amount of time.
They also cleaned my car. My car’s head light shield was foggy because it was old. But they cleaned and polished by some way. I originally thought they replaced the plastic part but I found it was original. Amazing job.<//Review>

I was the victim of a hit and run accident which was very unfortunate. My Mercedes c300’s mirror, rim, and the side of the car was in very bad shape. Gordon from Service King helped me out with this process. He was very professional and cheerful. He provided excellent customer service. I will definitely be recommending Service King to friends and family. Overall, I had a great experience here.< /text>

I have gone to this service king twice before. I gave them two stars because they do an excellent job on the car. However, their customer service has always been a problem. Despite having an appointment, they delayed me for an hour while going over the car, filling out paperwork, and finding the necessary people to sign off on it. I need to get to work and don't have time to sit in the waiting room.

The last time I came in, it took 2 weeks to get the appointment. Then I showed up and they told me I was "late" (they never in fact gave me a time to show up), but could fit me in. Then they told me they needed a guy who was not there to sign off on the paperwork (after waiting 1/2 hour). Can I leave the car? No, you need to make another appointment. Result, nothing accomplished, waited two weeks, have to start over again.

I am indeed starting again, but with another shop this time.< /text>

<text>I was in an accident and they did a great job fixing everything up, just like new.  That was several years ago, and in the last year the new door started to not close quite all the way: I stopped by and they tightened it up for me in 10 minutes for free.   I’m really happy with them, and how they did the right thing without any fuss.<//text><user_name>Philip Remes< /user_name>< date>

<Review>As a State Farm agent it is very important for me to get my customer's vehicles repaired with the least amount of inconvenience as possible.

Getting into an automobile accident is never fun and having professional people like those employed at Car West Auto Body makes it a seamless transaction from accident to getting the vehicle back on the road.

Sarah, the marketing representative, has been great at making sure that I receive the most up-to-date information on the company as well as checking back with me when vehicles are submitted through the agent portal to make sure that our mutual Guests have received the best experience possible.

If you are an agent get with Sarah, she will get things going for you.<//Review><user_id>115586993094650086160<//user_id><username>Matt A</username>< response>

The service I received was superb - from the moment I stepped in, to the moment my car was finished.  Dimarco Rivas did a really exceptional job at communicating the damages to my car, providing me with an estimate, updating me on the ETA, and working with my insurance agent.  A car rental was also provided until the repairs were done.  The process was so easy/painless.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience and would definitely return in the future.</review>< date>

<username>Josh Vasquez<//username><Review>Brought my car in to get my front end repaired on my Scion. The work was done very well. The repairs almost appear seamless. The paint work is spot on for a rare factory color my car came in. I really admire the work. For the next few weeks upon picking up my car I noticed some horrible repairs under the surfaces. Unnecessary screws holding panels where screws never were from the factory; just to keep things together. Really choppy/lazy approach to quick repairs. What gets me most about my experience with this shop is from the beginning of the whole process. The first day when I brought in my car, with an appointment and all, the service adviser that will be taking care of my car wasn't even there. Though the whole process of my car being in this shop I've been passed from advisor to another advisor. A total of four advisors and none have ever updated me on the status of my vehicle. I work for Honda so I know how most service centers work but this shop is just absurd when it comes to customer notifications. The worst part of the whole service is my GoPro that I use as a dash cam was TAKEN/STOLEN. I know it was taken because I stash the camera under my drivers seat out of sight and in a compartment which holds a vehicle lift/jack set. it doesn't stop there. The I mentioned the problem with the last service advisor who helped me and he told me to send an invoice. I've sent countless emails and called so many times I lost count. NO REPLY AT ALL. (Even emailed corporate with no response.)
It's just a shame since the Honda I work for we refer our customers to numerous Service Kings in the South Bay. Obviously I will no longer refer our customers to this location. (Should have known the reputation CARWEST had in the past before it became Service King.)
I was initially going to rate this service center 3 stars because I love the work that was done but upon writing this review I was just reminded of all the problems I've been though and my Stolen Camera.

If you ever decide to do business with this shop. Be very Cautious. Good Luck.< /Review>< UserId.>

<gmapID>0x808fcb89b320db45:0x2221cacd04868c61</gmapID><review>Our office has a great relationship with Carwest because of Sarah Heinz always keeping us  updated about the great services & amenities that Carwest offers our clients. Many of my clients tell me that they feel like a King/Queen from the moment they file their claim to the moment they pick up their car from Carwest. One client said she had been with 21st Century for over 10 yrs and never experienced the RED CARPET treatment.. We refer my clients to Carwest because they value our clients and deliver what they promise. Sarah Heinz is a Asset to this company and we are lucky to have her as my Rep.< /review><Response>None</Response></record>

Matt was an absolute SAINT. So knowledgeable, no pressure and really helped us find the right fit. He took the time to ask us questions to better understand options and which beds would be good choices. He gave us space and time to try out beds and was readily available to answer questions as they came up and provide further insight. There was no pushiness towards a certain brand or choice. Thank you so much and we will be directing EVERYONE to make bed purchases here.</text>

<text>The manager of the store helped us out. It was a very entertaining and fun experience which you don’t expect and never knew could ever be possible when shopping for a mattress. They have lots of options; ones we were were curious about and others we had already owned so we could compare and hopefully make a good decision. The knowledge was there and helpful. We will definitely go back there again!<//text>< pictures>

<text>Our salesperson, Sepehr, was very friendly, and helpful in leading us to the mattress that suited our needs. He offered us additional discounts to the posted price of our Cal King mattress, as well as verification of availability of the mattress for a speedy delivery and setup.  It was literally the best experience I’ve had in making a major purchase in many years.< /text>< Pictures>

Patrick was such a big help and had so much knowledge on all the Mattresses. Loved that he greeted us as soon as we walked in but allowed us our time by ourselves to look and try out all the Mattresses without feeling pressured. Also he explained every charge we would see on our bill and made sure we were aware of everything we ordered was correct. Thank you for making it so easy!< /text>

I was very pleased with our salesman, Sepehr Tourani, as he saw us arrive early and gladly opened his doors well before scheduled time for opening. He treated us like Family very warm and welcoming. He knew his product and was very helpful with our large purchase. We would definitely consider Mattress firm again to purchase where on half our life is spent. Good Sleep is all important after all< /Review>

Best service ever!!!! Sepher, Patrick and Matt went out of there way to make sure I was taken care of. They worked as one team and was patient with us until we found the perfect mattress.

We were shopping for a family of 6 and needed alot of questions answered. When one did not know the other stepped in. They made the process easy, plus I am pleased with my purchase. Matress Firm is pretty affordable offering great quality material. When you match that with great customer service you have a win.

I definitely would recommend this place to anyone in the market for a mattress.</text>

<review>Upon arrival at the Temecula store, we were greeted by Sepehr Tourani, Mgr, who I had spoken with earlier in the day. Sepehr remembered me immediately and what my desires were. He was extremely helpful and knowledgeable in showing us exactly what we were looking for and giving us a number of choices. There was no pressure and it was obvious that he wanted us to make the best choice for our needs. I had gone in originally just to get info on choices & costs. Because of Sepehr’s high level of customer service and willingness to help, we ended up purchasing our bed that evening.< /review>< Pictures>

Quick & easy purchase! They had what we wanted in stock & were able to deliver the next morning.  Our salesperson, Patrick, was great! Had a good sense of humor and did not try to talk us into an "upsale". Delivery guy was AWESOME. He was in & out in less than 10 minutes.</Review>

Today my husband and I were in dire need of a new mattress; went to Mattress Firm and the salesman Matt Brown was very patience and well informed. He was not your typical pushy salesman. He was great! He made the buying experience wonderful! Will recommend Matt to all I know who needs a good mattress and salesman!<//Review>

<Review>Clean, courteous and friendly store. Matt our sales rep, was excellent in giving us all detailed info about every mattress we were interested in, and helped us finalize our purchase. He was not pushy at all, and answered every question we had. I appreciate extreme details, and Matt gave us excellent customer service!<//Review>< pics>

I had a great experience with Mattress Firm.  I worked with Matt in the store and he was very knowledgeable.   My bed was able to be delivered the next day and the delivery team was extremely professional and quick.  I slept on my new bed last night for the first time and had the best night's sleep in quite a while!  I am so happy with my purchase and everyone I worked with!</review>

Great customer service. Well above expectation. I saw their bed frame ad on clearance listed on offer up. I called the store & though they were out of stock & sold out on that particular frame, Matt, Temecula Promenade Store, went above & beyond for me. He called his manager & got an approval to honor the ad & give me a similar frame at the same clearance rate! It was like a family member was working to get me the best possible deal. And this was all over the phone. Exceptional service & great product. Will definitely come back.
Thanks again Matt. I owe you a Starbucks!</Text>

My fiancé and I just bought our first home. Our dream for the last 6 years has been to get a King size bed to fit our whole gang comfortably (with our husky Finn and cat Chloe). We originally placed an order for an out of the box bed then canceled because we wanted to make sure our forever bed was the perfect plush comfort for the money we spent. Mattress Firm made that possible. We went with the plush beautyrest mattress. Big thank you to Patrick Mulvey for helping us choose our new bed and giving us awesome customer service!! We are so excited ♥️♥️</Text>

Forgot the name of the guy who assisted us but he is extremely knowledgeable and wasn’t pushy at all.  I didn’t go in the store to buy but rather just to test the beds.  But after all the information was provided , Mattress Firm is cheaper than online competition.</review>

The customer service was amazing! The salesman that helped me, Carlos, was knowledgeable, efficient, and friendly. He made it very easy to find the perfect match. Not to mention, they had a great, irresistible deal that saved me hundreds! They’re also very charitable, as they work with a charity foundation, the Ticket to Dream Foundation, to support foster kids by giving customers an option to give a cute, soft teddy bear to these children in need. This is a perfect place to buy a mattress that will last for a long time!<//review>

< review>
I had a wonderful experience with Matt at the Temecula Mattress Firm today. I had spoken with him on the phone last month about a particular mattress I wanted but the price was cheaper at  Mattress Firm's online site on Black Friday. So I ordered the mattress online. The mattress ended up being too firm for me so I went back to the store today to try some new ones. He told me I was going to have to return the other one online and to give them the name of the mattress I wanted. Which means he wouldn't get any credit. He then proceeded to spend 30 minutes showing me all around the showroom and educating me on mattresses. I thought he was a great guy. Very professional and friendly.< /review>

This was our first mattress purchase in 17 years (hanging my head in shame) and we were clueless.  Patrick is the first person we saw one night before heading to two additional stores.  Our discussions kept going back to Patrick and his knowledge and no pressure sales.  Furthermore, the other stores couldn't even touch Patrick's price so we went and visited him the following evening and purchased a mattress and adjustable base.  Easy, pleasant and straightforward are the best ways to describe dealing with Patrick.
Today was delivery day and it was seamless. They arrived on time, were professional, hauled away our old set, and assembled the new.
Would absolutely recommend Patrick and Mattress Firm.<//Text>

This was my first time purchasing a mattress and had the best experience. Patrick was absolutely AMAZING. I went in knowing nothing more than the size bed we wanted and ended up finding my dream bed and adjustable base for an exceptionally great price! Could not be happier and would 100% recommend!< /Review>

I was greeted by Matt And he was very knowledgeable and had a very simplistic way to identify what our needs were & took into count our budget. He was not pushy but he was honest. We also had a chance to work with Patrick as well, he was also very helpful in his knowledge & was answering questions for us.
So far a great experience for my wife & I. We Are awaiting a call from Patrick on Tuesday the 24th for us to come down to the store and pick up our new mattress.

Liam was a huge help to us. He was very patient, polite and pleasant. We went back and forth between trying out different beds and he was more than willing to accommodate us. He gave us every option available for everything from the base to the pillows. We got our new bed and can't wait to use it! 10/10 would recommend Liam to help you find the perfect bed for you!</text>

Great experience. Walked dreading to encounter pushy sales people but was met by Matt who was extremely knowledgeable and explained everything I needed to know before making a purchase. I didn’t feel rushed or pressured and it’s the first time I’ve had a positive experience purchasing something that didn’t involve a ton of anxiety. If you visit the store you should definitely ask for Matt!</review>

Great experience today buying THE most comfortable mattress with our salesman Matt. He was very thorough and patient with us since we had no idea what kind of mattress we were looking for. We never felt pressured. He helped us choose the perfect mattress pretty darn close to our budget and was able to throw in amazing memory foam pillows as well! Thoroughly enjoyed our buying experience at Mattress Firm and can’t wait for our new mattress to arrive!< /text>

First time at Mattress Firm. I’ve been dreading buying a mattress, but Carlos and Matt made it into a thoroughly pleasant experience. There was no pressure, and Carlos offered straightforward explanations of their product lines that made it easy to understand the differences among manufacturers and models. We got both a great mattress and the confidence that we made the right decision.</text>

Purchasing a mattress from Mattress Firm was super easy, our sales associate Carlos was amazing and fast!! They have an awesome donation project also for foster children called Ticket to Dream so if you go pick out a new mattress make a donation to the kids totally worth it, let’s make sure everyone has a good nights rest!!
Thank you Carlos your the man!<//Text>

I had a great experience at this location and Matt was incredibly helpful with showing me around the store and on top of that and he knew his stuff! He took his time and showed me different examples of beds and even better for the labor day weekend I got a discount for the adjustable base. He was able to help me with everything and even better with the price point I was looking for 😁

I would definitely recommend this location 💯<//Review>

Liam was fantastic! He guided us on our mattress-buying adventure. He was caring and attentive to our needs, and did not try to up-sell us. He even kept us within our budget which was much appreciated. There is a play area for the kids so you can take your time finding your ideal mattress. Definitely check them out!</Review>

<Review>Had a wonderful experience at this location. Definitely would commend Liam with his outstanding service that he provided me and my family. He was very patient, understanding and knows exactly what I was looking for. It made it easy to choose. I was going to try sleep number before heading to this location, but kind of went past by it. Good thing I did, because not only the mattress I selected was perfect for me, but the price fit the budget. Thank you so much Liam. Definitely recommending this place.</Review>< Pics>

Thanks to the help for the wonderful people at this location mattress firm. I was treated with kid gloves and the experience of the employees Sonya and Liam was invaluable to me while making my decision. I’m extremely happy with my delivery, purchase, and my purchase of Beautiful microfiber sheets. Sonia is an amazing sales person and Liam is extremely knowledgeable in all things mattress. I would highly recommend coming to this location and go out of your way to get here as it is well worth your time. Thank you to all of you at mattress firm for hiring such great people. Sincerely, Elizabeth and David</review>

Liam was amazing; very professional, knowledgeable and friendly. We were alone in the store so a bonus! Felt like we were personal shopping. Getting our mattress tomorrow and all aspects of buying experience were great!< /text>

It was truly a pleasure working with Carlos and the Mattress Firm team.  We had lots of questions, but they were very patient and answered all of our concerns.  Save time and money and check with Mattress Firm first!< /text>

We bought a bed for my daughter yesterday. They did not have same day delivery and they said Tuesday. They said I could go on the website and check on the status of the order. Website did not have the order info. The online chat service was unhelpful and asked me to check with the store. I waited until 10 and they said they could not deliver today. And they want to hold my money for 10 days.  I have spent over 7k on mattresses in this store within the last 12 months and would expect better service. I gave them a star because the sales Nathaniel was nice. I will never buy from this chain again and will let anyone who asks they are better off looking elsewhere. If I was Ken Murphy, I would be looking into logistics and new support systems to better meet today's customer. This step backward in service plus online brands delivering to your door in 24 hours are gonna clean their clock!</review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Not enough employees, we had to pull out our own demo mattresses to test while they helped other customers. However, the people working there are very nice and always had an answer for any question we had. Time spent in store was also really quick, we were in and out within 30 mins, which was great. Liam was very friendly and didn't try to sell was a ton of add-ons which was refreshing.</Text>

My husband and I went to Temecula location on Saturday to look for mattress.  We weren’t planning to purchase that day but we ended up purchasing and it is all because how great Liam Scott, Area Manager was as far as his knowledges about mattress and his professionalism at the same time easy to talk to customer service.  Liam answered all our questions from left to right and not only that, he educated us with all information we need to know to make decision.
Both my husband and I didn’t feel rushed or pressure to purchase and truly appreciate his throughout knowledges and awesome customer service!
We would definitely recommend mattress firm at this location.
Management, Please recognize Liam for his great work!!
Thank you!</Text>

Bought our mattress in January and we're very pleased! There was no pressure to "upgrade" to a more expensive brand/type. Everything was explained thoroughly. Our sales associate even helped make sure we were getting the lowest price, nationwide, on the set we bought. Delivery was on time, as promised, with updates on where the delivery truck was and who the delivery men would be.</Text>

<review>I spent $1500 on a mattress, pillows, and mattress protector about a year and a half ago. The mattress I received proved to be defective and was replaced. They said it was the fault of the frame it was on that caused the failure. I purchased a new frame from sleep train for $70 more. The new mattress started the same issues a few months after receiving it. We tried to call it in before it got as bad as the previous bed. They told us the bed was within "industry standard". It is now three more months and the bed is worse. We can not sleep for more than 3-4 hours at a time and are constantly stiff from our night. Going to bed starts a feeling of anxiety now as you know your sleep will be poor that night. Sleep train now wants me to pay for a re inspect and told me they will sell me a mattress on discount. I guess because my first experience was so good they think I would use them again! Getting my picket signs together and my trailer to haul their mattress to their parking lot so potential customers can see where they will be in a year and a half. Maybe if they try my bed in the parking lot first, they will think twice before they make a purchase at this establishment. Look for me in the coming weeks in Temecula at Sleep Train Mattress by the mall!<//review><rate>1< /rate><userid>116008854098632495740</userid>< username>

**This is NOT a Positive Review**
I was disappointed when same day delivery was not available as promised/quoted (received discount on delivery). We choose to wait a few more days for the mattress we waited years to purchase. Day before delivery, I realized, sleep train didn't call to convey the two hour delivery window from the scheduled block of time I picked. So, I was then EXTREAMLY upset when I called the store to find out that my delivery date had been changed to four more days further out!! (Sleep Train offered to remove the rest of the delivery charge and offered an "appeasement credit" ONLY after, I wanted a full refund) I don't know how to explain how the store handled this questionable error other than to say, I am doubtful of what was explained to me. I believed I was lied to, and was told, "I don't know" when looking for answers more times than I should've heard. I'm so very disappointed and feel what happened to me happens to customers more times than it should. And this kind of thing continues like some vicious circle. It's sickening. If it weren't for my husband accepting the "appeasement credit" I would've walked away with a full refund! **Shoppers**Sleep Train is NOT the only mattress retailer! I feel taken advantage of and that everyone involved has forgotten customer service. When the delivery finally arrived, of the two delivery guys, one was without professional etiquette and when he used vulgar language to express his frustration that was NOT particularly impressive! This gentleman was brutal with handling my very expensive mattress, destroying the protective box the mattress came, then desperately tried to tape it back together to deliver the mattress from the truck to my residence. He also, insulted the manufacture of mattress by blaming faulty shipping and condition of shipping or lack there of, even sharing what salesman of mattress manufacture discloses to warehouse. Trying to win me over. So unprofessional!! Delivery instructions were specific, if they'd just read the order. Keeping the Box on mattress was absolutely necessary! I would vehemently advise not buying a "price locked" mattress from Sleep Train, ever!< /text>

<review>Do not buy from Sleep Train!  They will steal your money,  and deliver a substandard product.  Particularly don't trust Dan at the Temecula store.  He will tell you whatever you want to hear and then deny it when there is a problem.  He will also lie to get the sale.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80db7e3dfda66c6d:0x1e0dc95323e18af5<//Gmap_id></record>

I went here not that long ago like a few weeks ago! Service was great but the food tasted a bit odd. It had a very interesting burnt taste to it. This shrimp was not really appetizing. Wouldn’t  come back but amazing service.</Review>

Kinda of a hidden gem if you tell me. It's all you can eat. A lot of options to choose from for your bowl. A lot of sauces to choose from and theres also a chart in case you dont know how to prepare your bowl. There's also a salad bar if you dont really feel like having Mongolian BBQ. Definitely coming back again.</review>

This is my favorite place to go for Mongolian hands down. I work in la and go around and try a lot of these types of restaurants and this is by far my favorite. The meat is always fresh the server is always super friendly and attentive! Only four stars cause I believe the server could be a lil over friendly sometimes when trying to enjoy food but she is so sweet!!! Mainly I gave it four stars cause I really wish they had a soft serve machine hahaha< /Text>

First time visitor for lunch today. Had an amazing meal, enriched by Linda's welcome and warmth.  Followed by her food suggestions and assistance in preparing not only my lunch, but fully involved the same way with ALL of the customers. BTW, the Egg Flower soup is a 12!
Awesome time, will be back.<//Review>

Yesterday was the first time we went to this good restaurant. But It is surely not the last time. We passed a splendid evening with the good service, with the excellent  cuisine and fine drinks and with the decent pay. We will no doubt go back there soon.< /review>

I loved this little, hidden Gem. We had such a great experience. The food was fresh and the staff was friendly and helpful. If you're looking for a great Mongolian BBQ place that is close to Bakersfield; this is it. My husband was impressed with the selection of fresh ingredients and sauces available and I enjoyed the little extras that were included. We got there about half an hour before closing and Linda (our server) suggested we prep 2 bowls each so we wouldn't feel rushed before the grill closed. One bowl each was more than enough, but it was nice to have an extra to add just veggies. We will definitely be back.< /Text>

The only Mongolian BBQ in the SCV area. It is a little restaurant and the sign outside is small so you could miss it. The food is good but not the best that I have had. The noodles are really orange as if they added food coloring. My daughter wouldn't even eat them and she loves noodles. The sauce mixture is different from other places I've been. I'm glad they added shrimp and keep it separate from the other meats. I wont say that is be a regular at this restaurant but it's a different change from all the chain restaurants and fast food joints.</Review>

Fresh, Fresh, Fresh.  Veggie and meat selections were great.  Plus a Salad bar and Dessert section.  Lots of choices to make a sauce and they help you make it taste great.  Staff is really professional and friendly.  My first time here, I'll be back.</review>

Delicious and fun. I stumbled across this location and now it’s one of my favorite places to eat. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious. They have an all-you-can-eat option and offer a punch card for future visits. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice meal out with the family.</Text>

I have to say I am glad I went back to this place, it has improved very much. Better options to select from, open salad bar at lunch, includes soup, rice, appetizers such as paper wrapped chicken, Fried Wanton's, Egg Rolls, as well as deserts.

Highly recommend.</text>

This restaurant has been here for as long as I can remember.  It's definitely a favorite of mine. The staff are always friendly, remember us, and even comment on how much our kids have grown. I like this personal touch that you don't get in the big chain places.

I have my secret recipe for the way I make my bowl and it never lets me down.  Keep up the good work Genghis Khan!<//review>

Fantastic owners that provide excellent service, great quality to price AYCE Mongolian BBQ. If you're unsure, just ask for help or look at the recipe guide to come up with the flavor profile you want.

This is definitely a locals spot that most visitors would not find otherwise.

Is it a fine dining, white table cloth, Michelin star restaurant? No, not does it try to be. This is just good food at a good price for a family run business where the folks are really kind and have been an institution to this you're for a long time.

We love coming here as it never disappoints!< /review>

This place was awesome! A large group of us stopped in on a Friday night and the staff treated us so well and were so helpful with choosing how to season our dinner.
Every other Mongolian BBQ restaurant has made me feel like an idiot while mixing the sauces, this place was happy to help make a good sauce.<//Text>

I love this place. Been going for close to 20 years and never not once had a bad experience. Mongolian bbq is perfect and I love the buffet too. And the salad bar. And the soup. And the service. You should go here.< /review>

We found this online on our way home just off the freeway.  We really liked the food, the atmosphere and especially the service.  Linda our waitress gets six stars for service!  These kudoes are long in coming, but better late than not doing it at all.< /review>

Extremely friendly and helpful staff helped my friends and me (all of whom were having this cuisine for the first time) create our bowls to our tastes perfectly. The food itself was delicious, the egg rolls were probably the best I've ever had, and there really aren't enough words to give credit to the staff.
I know where I am going for food the next time I'm anywhere remotely near Santa Clarita.<//text><userid>100980579452867100652<//userid>< user_name>

Found this place based on the restaurants near me. While it was a little tricky to find this place is well worth the visit. A friendly and welcoming staff combined with an excellent atmosphere provides the setting for a good meal. The food is absolutely divine with multiple sauces you can make yourself or ask for some help making. It is a simple, yet fulfilling restaurant that visiting brings a smile to your face and belly. The price was ~14 dollars and worth every penny.< /review>

We've been coming here for a little over 12 years. Service is always on point friendly caring. Food is delicious as usual I like coming for dinner though it has shrimp :) ... its AYCE! I can only go once though it fills you up. The egg roles are by far my favorite. Make sure you stop by if you are around Santa Clarita.< /review>

The most delicious and well priced all you can eat buffet I've ever seen. This place is an absolute hidden gem in Santa Clarita and deserves more good publicity. It's also a great place to take someone on a date to give the impression that you know the local dining scene well. The staff is extremely attentive, very nice people, and the atmosphere is fantastic.<//text>

< Review>
I really enjoy eating here, it's an experience I take all my out of town guest there to share. To start you are offered bread or rice for the table, then there is a salad bar, a hot appetizers and soup options, then you have all the raw ingredients to create your own bowl, frozen shaved beef, pork, chicken or turkey, noodles and an array of veggies, then you go to the sauces, they have recipes posted so you know how much of each thing to add and the staff is always there to assist, then you take it to the chef manning the Mongolian BBQ, he dumps everything from your bowl and using a spatula chase's it around the BBQ, poor guy must walk miles a day. It cooks in no time. And comes off that grill steaming hot, smelling incredible, be warned it needs a few minutes to cool down,  before you get your first taste. Well worth the wait. Staff is attentive, food is fresh, great place for lunch, dinner or a party.<//Review>

I've been going here for probably 30 years, as far back as I can remember it being here anyway. It has gone through some management/ owner changes but overall still has great food and prices. I have never once had rude service or any problems with them and have been there way too many times to even count. I personally recommend them anytime. Its Mongolian BBQ people, compare to other places of its type, Genghis Khan is a perfect choice.<//Review>

Great food, great service. We're lucky to have spotted it on our way to L.A. within the last year. We've been stopping here to eat every time we head south now. Highly recommend!< /Text>

An interesting how you can I restaurant. A kind of cross between Hotpot and Hibachi Grill. Daft is super friendly and will guide you through the experience. Our waitress said this location is over 30 years old</Text>

Incredibly friendly staff and delicious food (both salad bar and grill).
The decor isn't all that modern, more of a snap shot of the 90's but please don't let that stop you from giving this place a chance!

Great serivce and at first I thought the food was good, but as soon as my fiancee and I got home we felt sick to our stomachs. There were very little people there so I believe they recycle old meat thus we got sick. If you want to try it out maybe you will get luckier than me. I really wish we didn't get sick from the food, but we did and we will not be going back.< /review>

Really interesting style of food, I’ve never had mongolian barbecue and found it to be very delicious and the staff were EXTREMELY friendly and helpful, I have never received such amazing service, I’m generally stingy when it comes to the tip but here I felt they deserved every penny. An overall wonderful experience and I will be coming back.</Review>

<review>I've been to other mongolian bbq places in different cities and states, and this is by far, the best experience i've ever had. Great food, nice atmosphere and best of all, the friendly staff. Thank you Linda, Lola and Jose. You folks are the best. And ladies and gentlemen, on your first/next visit, be sure to have Linda help you out with the "Linda suace". It is grrrrrrrrreat!!!!< /review>< date>

Hadn't been since a horrible experience 12 yrs ago. Well, nothing's changed. Staff hovers over you to make sure you're not sharing & are very rude, they asked my daughter twice how old she was in the middle of our meal, so they could charge us more, man told us drinks came w/ meal, but then woman said no & charged us almost $5.00 for 2 drinks. Topper, we all got SICK! FOOD WAS GROSS!<//Text>

The food and service were great, but the initial impression was confusing as nothing was explained to us about how to do things. Once that was cleared up, we were stuffing our faces just fine!< /Review>

<review>This Mongolian BBQ is out of the way for me, but will stop there when ever we are nearby. I used to have an annual pass to Magic Mountain and my friends and I would always stop here and have dinner after.

It is not only Mongolian BBQ, they also have Chinese food buffet as well. I love the MBBQ, they have the sauces broken down to components, rather than simply choosing hot, medium or mild, you can choose the ingredients to make it HOT or mild. They also have more components and ingredients for the food as well. This is the only MBBQ I have been to that has peanuts and peppers.

I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. But in my circles it is a bit off the beaten path.

UPDATE:
We ate here on a Magic Mountain trip about 2 weeks ago, and the food is still as amazing as my previous review and visits going back to the late 1980's.

They have remodeled in the time since my last visit and it looks much better, however they eliminated the Chinese food buffet, not that I ever ate off the buffet it was just kinda nice as an option.

Syd ruined her first bowl as it was way too salty, when we told the waiter he explained that this happens alot. People who visit other Mongolian BBQs will add too much of the sauces, reason being he told us, many of the other M-BBQs will water down the sauces so they last longer, which really doesn't make sense for them to do, as I simply use 15 ladle fulls of sauce rather than the 1 or 2 I need here.< /review>< rating>

This used to be my favorite mongolian bbq spot but now the service is rude. The older asian gentleman downright talks down to people and tries to extort a tip when he messed up the experience.  Will never come back.<//Review>

<Text>I have seen several different restaurants occupy this building here, but this current one is worthy of a five-star review. Authentic Mexican cuisine, minimalist dining room décor and they do accept Visa/MasterCard. The menus are all in Spanish, but that's understandable considering the cuisine served here. I'll gladly return.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

This spot is my favorite. I go to many restaurants but here I  constantly return again and again. The team is very helpful and the food they offer is so fresh and tasty. I never miss an opportunity to have a nice meal in this restaurant. I highly recommend this place.<//Text>

Nachos are my favorite snack and their nachos(no meat) are the best I have had in a long time. The mixture of beans, cotija cheese, onions, cilantro, tomatoes & jalapenos is so delicious.
I feel the same about the fish tacos & shrimp tacos. It is hard to come by good seafood tacos and theirs are delicious & big.
Plus their Horchata is perfect, not too much cinnamon.
This is my new favorite Mexican food restaurant!!!</text>

Me and my bf didn’t like the way the cashier lady just gave us attitude for no apparent reason. Like once we came in, she rolled her eyes. I took it like “ugh they are going to make me work” kind of way. Maybe she got upset because we were going to make her do her job. Instead of pretending to clean the same spot and ignoring that we were standing there. A short lady working pm shift blonde hair, like how rude!< /Text>< date>

(Translated by Google) The food tastes good we ordered tacos with handmade tortillas, I was surprised with the head they were delicious it is not easy to find a place with good taste especially of the head, the beer is fine, we also ordered delicious fines too, the affordable prices, what Recommended are very cold warmers, friendly employees, the only thing that takes a little while with the orders!

(Original)
La comida tiene buen sabor ordenamos tacos con tortillas hechas a manos, me sorprendi con los cabeza estaban deliciosos no es facil encontrar un lugar con buen sabor especialmente de cabeza, la birria esta bien, tambien ordenamos mulitas deliciosas tambien, los precios accesibles, lo que recomnedaria son unos calentones hace mucho frio, los empleados amables, lo unico que si tardan un poco con las ordenes!</review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Bad service, reasonable prices. But it lacks more customer service and more attention and speed they last an eternity to serve the employees talk a lot, they do not see seriousness or customer satisfaction

Every day is good for me only the next day his black passed a little courage only Abia 2 people and it took like 20 minutes to give me my order.
The Cajare was relaxing with a guero boy, nor did he give me my water.

They won’t let me fill up my tires for free. I told the gas attendant by law she has to turn the air on for me and she said no. Five times. My tire is flat and nobody carries spare change. ESPECIALLY DURING COVID</Review>

I had charges on my credit card as Jalidat Inc.  I called the store several times to see if this gas station was connected with Jalidat and the girl was EXTREMELY rude.  She wouldn't answer my question and hung up on me.  I guess I will have to dispute the charges with my credit card company since I do not know if they are valid.  You would think when it involves money they would at least tell you how the charges appear on the credit card.</Text>

I am and always will be a horse and buggy guy... if you see a horse and buggy in north hills, that's me... this place sells this liquid called petroleum? It's for those new horseless carriages people driving around now. Side note... don't feed petroleum to horeses... and is anyone selling a horse? I need a new one... I'd pay two whole dollars.</review>

While price wise this Valero is a good nickel or so higher than other Valeros in the area, this one has a decent car wash. If you have a Valero card, the price of their Ultimate Wash becomes only $3..and that's worth the extra nickel a gallon. Most gas stations with car washes charge up to $9-$10 for a similar wash.<//Review>

Attendant was rude when breaking down the fact that we couldn't get free air when we pulled up with a flat,  we had to purchase gas. Gave her 25 cents worth of change to get a quarter to put in the air machine for her to throw the change back and say to put it in the machine. When she realized we needed the quarter she just threw that back at us too. Haha doesn't even deserve stars, what a class act.< /Text>

I went to this stores location due to being in the area with a friend. I was satified with this store, it was clean and the workers were really helpful. The line was a little long since there was only 1 line opened, but it didn't take to long to check out & get out of the store. Thank You!!!!</Text>

There's a shop next to Ann's donuts that sells name brand items at a discount price. My daughter and I went there to purchase shoes for her. She was able to find just what she wanted. Apparently she comes here all the time.< /Review>

<Review>So much yum! I love that they give you so many pickles n things with your meal. Our server was a dear. Their hours are kinda frustrating, as they actually close from 2:30-5pm, so be warned, no late lunches! And if you want those veggie pancakes, get there before 6:30 or they might have run out!</Review>< pictures>

The tofu, beef and fried rice was great. But the soup broth itself a little boring. Maybe we picked the wrong kind?< /review>

We love Hi Tofu, because it's a quaint restaurant but with really friendly service. We always get the tofu bowl, and just enjoy going in and having a delicious meal. The ladies who work there are always so sweet to my son, and it's part of the reason it's one of our favorite places in Temecula to eat.< /Text>

The food was really good and the lady who served us was the sweetest person I’ve ever met. One of our orders was messed up and she offered to make it again but we told her it was fine. We ordered something without knowing that it was their break time but they made it for us anyway and now I feel a little bad ha... The food is delicious and we will be coming here often</review>

Very disappointed. Went there at 7pm. They couldn't take my husband and I because they only had enough food for the  catering. The least they could have done was to say" please come back and here is a coupon for buy one get one ". They lost a good customer. We would drive to San Diego than ever go to HI Tofu. Good Bye Tofu !!!. You deserve 0 star.<//Text>

Pretty decent place for lunch. Great customer service. I only tried the ramen dish for two so couldn't speak much about the other ones. The ramen was tasty but nothing unique. Overall a good place for lunch.<//text>

< Review>
Stopped in on the way home to check out this restaurant, and it is not vegan right any stretch of the imagination. They have some options available with tofu, but almost everything that they offer on their menu has some kind of meat or Animal product in it, so I didn't even bother.<//Review>

I am very happy  to found a korean restaurant in Temecula.  It has very convenient location next to Walmart shopping mall in Temecula.
All food was great,  especially soon tofu and chicken teriyaki.  Great service and good price. Try example of all Korean food here.
I guarantee it!!!< /Text>

<Review>Summary: Because of the grand review on Yelp I decided to give Hi Tofu a try. This place was a little hard to find, it was tuck in the corner somewhat on the side of La Cocina Restaurant.

Foods: Korean Style Veggie Pancake, Hot Stone Bibimbap, and a spicy Seafood Soondubu (which according to Hi Tofu Menu is just: Tofu Soup).

The Veggie Pancake was very bland and oily, I don't understand how the reviewer speak so highly of it. The sauce for the Bibimbap was a non spicy flavorless paste and anyone with experiences should know that the sauce is the main ingredient which completes the Bibimbap dish. As for the Soondubu (or Tofu Soup), I was devastated. The silken tofu was completely unseasoned and uncooked, which is... unacceptable. And why were there jalapenos in my Soondubu? If you call this place you run authentic then you shouldn't be adding JALAPENOS.

Service: The old lady (whom I assume is the owner/relative) was very kind at first but became hostile when I told her how the cook should use less oil for the pancake, jalapeno should not be in the soondubu, and the kimchi should be fermented a bit longer.

Overall: Maybe, just maybe when I can no longer drive myself to Korea Town in Orange County, I'll give this place another try. But for now, I'll stick with Kaju in Garden Grove as my go to authentic korean food.< /Review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I have a bit of a misfortune about Sundae. I feel like Kimchi stew. Bukchang-dong Sook-boo If you think about it, you might be sorry. Note please

Friendly service is good

순두부 조금 아쉬운 점이 있어요 김치찌개 같다는 생각이 듭니다. 북창동 순두부 생각하고 가시면 아쉬울 수 있어요 한국 사람 입맛보다는 현지 입맛에 맞춘 듯 합니다. 참고하세요

친절한 서비스 좋습니다< /text>

(Translated by Google) I ate some soft tofu and ribs, but the taste is not good at all, and the amount of ribs was very different from BCD.

Great quality bagels and bagel sandwiches. Perfect for lunch dinner or snack.
The potato bagel is the best!!!
I came in for 2 toasted bagels at 2:30 in the afternoon. The staff seemed like they were done with the day and not helpful. As I was there I saw that was not totally the case. The girl behind the counter gave a man his bagel sandwich and apologized  for the length of his wait. She offered him a muffin of his choice to make up for it. He accepted and was truly thankful for her gesture.
That was nice to witness. My bagels were as requested and delicious. I did not have a long wait.
Thanks< /text>

During the pandemic, this location of Einstein's Bagels deserves a Gold Star.  The employees deserve an A+ for operating safely and following measures to keep us customers safe.  In fact I say it is the safest eating establishment in San Diego.  They are patient with me when I call after using the app which is not perfect, to adjust my order. Every time I place an order whether for pick-up or curbside, my order is ready within minutes.  Plus they do a great job making bagel sandwiches and my ice coffee. If you are looking for a quick breakfast, coffee or snack in a safe location, this place is the best.<//text>

I saw this place after work and knew I had to go. Today I wanted to try a new thing out of my usual routine, so I got a French toast bagel with maple spread! I couldn't wait till I got home to try this new bagel (new for me) It was good but then it just becomes too much spread and then its ok. I got my usual chocolate chip bagel with peanut butter just in case this would happen. Still happy with everything and the service at this location.</Review>

I have been here a number of times.  The bagels and food are what you expect from any Einstein.  But the customer service is highly variable.  My sense is that they are poorly managed understaffed or both.  When they lost my order today and it took 25 minutes for one bagel they got defensive instead of just saying sorry.  Other times they are better but if there is any line at all I recommend you head for the door or you will be waiting a long time or worse.<//Text>

<Review>Cindy the manager needs to know if you have something wrong with your order. I had three orders not go right, one that was cold so I decided to go back this time and just let her know instead of writing a bad review. She can only fix the problem if she knows. She handles things very professionally, sincerely and kindly! I appreciate the refund and her offer to remake the breakfast. That’s how businesses should run!
Please don’t rip a new on on reviews go to the manager in person and let them know so they can do quality control with their staff.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Whole staff seemed very nice and the entire facility seemed very clean. Got the farmhouse bagel for breakfast, 10/10 would recommend. Also probably a good idea to grab some napkins.< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1540920967904, 'text': 'Thank you for stopping by, Susan! Have a great day, and we hope to see you again soon!'}</Resp>< Date>

<Review>Bagel was hardly toasted. All three coffee dispensers were empty. My wife wanted to enjoy her coffee with her sandwich but that didn’t happen. Once the coffee was done she found that the creamer was out. Three employees working and just an over all bad experience and customer service.<//Review>< Rating>

If you do bakers dozen with 2 tubs of cream cheese it's about $12 if you pick up before 11am (around $15 if after 11am). Try the honey almond spread on a plain bagel...sweet deliciousness.<//text>< pictures>

What had set apart this establishment was the Vegan cream cheese they NO longer offer. Unfortunately now it's just your typical coffee and a dry bagel, preferably to go. Hopefully they'll be more inclusive again,  til then...</review>

<text>Nice bagels with fresh cream cheese. Good pitstop to grab a quick bagel meal. Lots of variety to choose from except they had run out of a lot of options at noon. I really wanted to try the jalapeno cheddar but they'd run out. Ended up with onion and everything bagel which was nice. The staff was also nice and accomodated my request to add mushroom and egg even after order was placed at no cost! Washrooms were clean and required a passcode.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1B-pWufDrhFK87LST7LMHJOQhBNE4JeIIdnur=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Not happy with this location. First of all a toasted bagel should be a light brown and crispy not white and doughy. We waited 10 mins for our bagels just 2 and finally found them up on the counter. All the while names are being called out for others to pick up their order. When I asked to have my bagel remade because it was now luke warm the girl told me you must not have heard us call your name. I was sitting right in front of the counter. Wrong answer. Her response should have been "I am sorry let me remake this for you" Great customer service is the success of any business. The staff needs re-training and a toasted bagel means lightly brown, crispy and warm.<//Review></record>

Bought 6 bagels,  they were hard as rocks, called next morning offered to bring them to the manager, she said she would replace them, I went for the replacement and was treated as though I was trying to scam 6 free bagels!  A tall male employee was very rude and loud  saying we make our bagels fresh e ery day, so what was wrong with them?   I  explained  to  him the details and he got louder and louder saying that I was should know, I  said I  don't know how to make bsgels but something was wrong.  I'm  disabled and jt is hard to get around.  The man continued to insult me and finally said if you want the bagels  I  will let you have them , I  said keep your bagels and I  left.  After the manager called and said she didn't think his intentions were bad she said come in  and I will give you some free items....like I will ever go back!  I didn't do anything wrong.  I have a small fortune in the bank  I don't steal, lie, or cheat.  I  may sue that employee or Einstein Brothers.   I have been going to that location since they opened, until recently due to a series of serious surgeries and life changing events.  Zero stars if possible!<//review>

<review>Unless you live in Brooklyn or the N.Y. area u can't truly find a really good bagle sure sometimes a small bakery will do it right most times it's the supermarket and to be honest supermarket bagles suck! I wish there were more of these places! At least I like these.<//review>< username>

One of the workers accidentally grabbed a blueberry muffin instead of a chocolate chip muffin and handed it to me. When I saw it was the wrong order she gave me the right order and only charges me for one. They also had made an extra coffee and with no charge walked outside and gave it to my grandma. Amazing service!< /text>

I used to work at that location between 2003 and 2004. And even though the food back then was delicious, the employees were rude, ghetto and very gossipy, even the store manager was a rude a selfish prick. I was fired by the store manager at that time because I couldn't work on Labor Day. I gave him a 3-week notice about it because my babysitter couldn't work that day, but he still fired me. And he was so chicken he wasn't there to terminate me, instead a store supervisor gave me the papers. So unprofessional!

If you want to eat at a restaurant without all the ghetto and rude employees, DON'T EAT THERE. If you're planning on getting a job there and you don't do any of the above, DON'T APPLY THERE. But if you like or do all that stuff...then by all means, enjoy.</Text>

One word to describe Abraham and his team, AMAZING! Retained him for an Indio Jail Wedding and he took care of everything efficiently and quickly! Best service all around! Super nice and always responds within the hour. He is a Spanish speaker, and works with you around your schedule.
Thank you so much for everything Abraham. -Isaiah & Stephanie< /text>

What more can I say about this man Abraham?!  He is so professional and accommodating. I am a loan officer and he signed 2 loans for me in a single day and BOTH were at the exact same time. How did he do this you might ask? One was at 4:30 a.m. which was the only way to meet the clients' needs. He scanned our loan docs back before the escrow officer even woke up and we funded the loan the same day! He did this without complaint or issues. The next was at 4:30 p.m. for a very elderly gentleman whom required a lot of extra time for the signing, which again, was done without complaint. This is what you get when you choose Abraham. He is the best of the best! Thank you for always being there for me and my clients.</text>

<text>Abraham was on top of it! I called him with short notice and he didnt skip a beat. He is knowledgeable and professional. I called a few other places and I felt skeptical and uneasy, but the minute I spoke to him I knew I was in good hands! If I ever need a notary again I will be calling him!</text>< Name>

Abraham was very professional and offered excellent service for what I needed. Was able to meet me on an Sunday morning and has the best prices I was able to find. I used his service to marry my fiancé that is currently incarcerated and he explained everything to the tee and made it quick and painless..
I will recommend his service to anyone and will use him for future needs as well.<//Text>

Pass Notary was very convenient and easy to work with. Recently a relative passed and I needed papers notarized quickly and they were more than helpful with fitting me into their schedule when it was more convincing for me.  The service was amazing and they have affordable price as well.< /Text>

Abraham was extremely professional. I called and the very same day he took the paper I needed notarized to get married to the jail to get signed by my fiance. His wife, who performs the ceremony was available to go to the county clerks office the very next day to get my marriage license. They are very affordable. I am so glad I found them I would reccomand them to anyone!!< /Review>

The food was piping hot, and stayed fresh, tender, and crunchy(onion rings) the full 10 minutes that it took me to get home. The server was polite and quick. I am totally satisfied and will order take out from them again.</Text>

<Name>Carro Patrullas<//Name><Review>The  reason we visited this place. because  applebee's website has several of good family special deals... And since my daughter was inviting us ... We decide to stop by and order a family deal.
The waiter wasn't aware of the deals on website..she said if we can look for it to see what we where talking about... After 15 mins.. we show her the special deals.
She didn't know how to put it on the system. She try to suggest us if we can order something else instead of the one we wanted to get in the first place?... We said if this why we here for... I guess the manager heard the conversation and step in to see what was going on.. she explained to waiter to just look the picture on my daughter cell phone and write down all the menu plates and the amount it shows on.  The manager 👍. she did took care of the problem well professional customer service ... I will come back  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.

Waiter ⭐⭐⭐⭐ for not been familiar with the 🍎 applebee's website special deals.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcabace7a0b6ef:0xb34484ddd0563f44< /Gmap_id><Rating>4</Rating></record></dataset><record>

Bravo Applebee's for making us feel so safe with the tables separated even when that means sacrificing business a bit. It means a lot to know you care🙌 thank you!! And their spring time drink specials are delicious🤤 I had the tipsy shark and loved it.<//Text>

<review>I called before arriving to make sure that we, a family of 6 will be able to sit together. Person that answered said yes. When we arrived, Haileu said that we could not seat together. Then we found  a table  on the other side of  of the tent, where we sat. We asked to please clean table.   She  showed a bit of an attitude when taking out order and  the whole service was just not friendly at all. Sucks.<//review>< Response>

Fake chicken! We got oriental chicken salad and a southwest chicken bowl and Mozzarella  sticks . The mozzarella sticks were pretty decent but when we got our entrees both of our chicken breast tasted like reconstituted pressed chicken, very rubbery with a very strange texture, and the chicken bowl had some lime flavoring to it that tasted just nasty.<//text>

Used app, 30 min. Later to pick up, curbs all full, had to go inside, waited 45 minutes to receive food from unapologetic server. Only food for 2 people,  not a difficult order. Restaurant was half full on a Friday late afternoon. Disappointing.<//text>

<Review>4 stars is for the food and the vigilance of the manager to correct my almost raw steak. I just love the ambiance of the parking lot while sitting next to a busy road of smog spitting cars. Did I mention we liked the food?</Review>< user_id>

<Review>Love the fact that they have outdoor dining, but more importantly, the food is good and the drinks too. Good happy hour specials and a good place to go hangout. Once they are able to have indoor dining it'll be cool to hang at the bar and watch sports. Check it out.<//Review>< response>

<rate>2<//rate><text>They didn't fill the order correctly forgot the fries, french onion soup was horrible not even close and burgers were cold. I had a pic up time of 440 pm got there at 444 waited for about 5 mins before they came out then told me order was being finished waited couple more minutes than they came back to verify the name oh that's ready she said I'll go get it another couple of minutes got food and just before getting home got a call they forgot the fries nice of them but they're 12 miles away. So I won't do this idea again. I ordered the bourbon burger if it had sauce on you couldn't prove it to me. Overall bad experience it proves that they can't do take out very good oh I've been to Applebee's many times never had good service at this unit others pretty good service. Here if you don't buy drinks at the your at the back of the line for food and service I have noticed.<//text>< Pictures>

< review>
Got our order in timely fashion, however... My potatoes were only add bacon / cheese, and there was sour cream slathered on top. My girlfriend's meal was supposed to be without lettuce, though it had plenty as you see in the photo. I was supposed to get tartar sauce for the shrimp, that didn't happen either. The cheesy broccoli, wasn't cheesy at all, maybe a pinch of shredded cheese on 2 of them. However, the zombie drink, and the red Dracula drink were both very good! The steak I ordered was cooked perfectly (for once), and the shrimp were also very good, though lacking tartar that was ordered. If it wasn't for the drinks and perfect steak / shrimp, this would be a 1 star review. (Yes I should of checked my order, but all this covid BS they were getting people in and out and I was trying not to hold up the line, next time I will make everyone else wait, lesson learned)< /review>

< Review>
The service was despicable. A group of ten were told our table was ready three times before we were seated. Then, eight were served and my girlfriend and I were told that she (the waitress) was going to serve another table and then return to take our order. The other couple, two military veterans, asked for a menu, and was told that she forgot and did not think that the couple was still interested. They did receive their order.  We were there for about two hours.<//Review>

Food was alright I guess...it was fair...but you literally have to buy food in order to buy alcohol drinks..it's a real bummer..our waitress was very rude to when we told her the beer was hot if we can get another she was just straight rude. They need better servers..</Review>

I go to this marvelous  restaurant from time to time because I like the special air that is unique to this place. The staff is very loving and professional. The service is remarkablywonderfully fast. Most important, the food you eat is outstanding. I ate there many times and I was always happy. The cost is reasobable. I suggest this restaurant to to everybody.</Review>

FOOD POISONING WARNING. This location neglects proper food safety handling and preparation procedures.
As far as the car side to go is concerned, it's better to just go in and get it. Their "I'm here button" doesn't work, and calling they dont answer.
Also, CHECK YOUR ORDER. They will try and cheap you out of things you've paid for.<//text>

<review>Amazing customer service, good food, overall enjoyable experience! Our waiter was Joel and he did such an amazing job! My family and I have had a bad experience at another Applebees location, we swore off eating there. Tonight's experience gave us a change of heart and we will be back for a visit again!

It's always hit and miss when we go to Applebees. Last night was a serious miss. Our waiter Brandon provided us with some awful service. When we sat down, first off got our drink orders wrong. After we sat down some "regulars" sat down behind us about 15 minutes later and that's when Brandon went into action. He almost completely forgot about us. Not only did the table behind us get their appetizers before us, they also got their meals before us. They were a party of 4 and we were just a party of 2. So how does that happen? The food is the only thing not making this review a one star. The food came out great. You should treat every customer the same.<//Review>

I just visit them on last week again, I have been with my daughter she wanted to go to the all-you-can-eat 😪 it don't mean it all you want each time you got less and less that is the one we went to in Redlands but my daughter had just went to the one in Arizona, is altogether different and this is interesting I was disappointed with my shrimp they were tough. Supposed to be riblets the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen I didn't eat it I just left it and when it got me something else to eat I would never go to Redlands to eat again maybe some other Applebee's<//text>

Amazing drinks fit perfect with meals for entire family. Depending what you order can be kind of pricey but overall amazing meals and well worth spending the extra money.< /Review>

<Review>Food was good (went for the all you can eat ribblets, Double crunch shrimp, and wings) the wings were as good as always, the ribblets seemed to be lacking and had a ton of small bones, the double crunch shrimp were actually really good when they were freshly fried, but when it came to the drinks they were quite pricey (even during happy hour) and when it comes to getting a bang for your buck I personally recommend Chili's over Applebee's. They have good quality deals and rewards on top of that.< /Review>< Rate>

She is wonderful with her profession of work to the extent I'm here writing this review, she directed us to Joel the waiter with a great personality thank you trish for making this Halloween family dinner just perfect!!</review></record>

Never going here again! Me and my husband went last night 1/28/20! And while we were ordering our food there was a roach crawling on our table 🤮🤯🤮🤯. The waiter watched my husband hit it with the menu and just walked away. We immediately got up and left. So many other people were there eating their food🤮🤮. No stars from me<//Review>

<text>Edited:  Second visit was pretty good.  Still loving those onion rings.  Got the correct sauces... love the buffalo sauce for the chicken tenders...  We did have to wait 8 minutes when we were picking up inside but every server that passed by made sure we had been attended to.

Original Review:  Ordered online to pickup in the restaurant.  Ordering was easy, was even a promo at the time for online purchases above $25.  Food was ready quick and service was friendly.  Unfortunately the main downfall (among other things), we found out after getting home 20 minutes later that they completely messed up on the critical sauces to accompany both our meals!...  ... ... ...   It was too far to go back to take care of it so the manager promised to make it up to us the next time we're there.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

We ordered the dinner 2 for $22 I ordered the sirloin steak it was very good nice and juicy and the salad that came before the meal was surprisingly large.
The meal was pretty big and the price was great. 👌</Review>

I purposefully never come here, but what can I do when a get together is thrown, and this is chosen as the destination.
I just want to say fries shouldn't be cold and chewy like a leather shoelace, and chicken tenders probably should be hot aswell.
Yes they messed up chicken tenders and fries.
The beer was good but lacked the garnish, no big deal, but is again another sign of lazyness. Was a weeknight party of 8 and the restaurant wasn't packed. I know there are factors that I don't know or may not even understand, but my bottom line is I keep getting bad food here.
I don't hate you, I'm just not going to eat here.
Thanks, but no thanks.<//Text>

Took my 11 year old here for his birthday - the whole family of 6. We had a good time; pleasant atmosphere. Our server (I'm sorry I forgot her name) was very helpful and kept her attention on us without being overbearing. What would make 5 stars is if they give you your second alcohol beverage on the house 😉 perhaps after a certain hour. I'm just saying, their limited time peach margarita was on point, but at $9 with a family of 6, including a 12 year old who eats like a grown man - that extra $9 would have killed me... although I would have went for it if hubby said yes. No luck. Anyway, after my husband gets over the bill, we will return.</text>

Some places don't do a great job at ensuring accuracy but this place gets it right every time. The servers are overall friendly but sometimes they do tend to get frustrated if you do need what they offer. For example, they ask you if they can get you any boxes or more drinks and when you say yes, they seem upset. Regardless, I'd still recommend this location< /Review>< date>

The service wasn't bad nor was it great. The food was good but also not great. Still worth going for a nice time. Staff was friendly and accommodating. 4/5</Review>

<Text>The restuarant on Highland ave has very young people that do not seem to care about the older customers. They take their time and the people will walk right out and never come back. We have tried to come in to the restaurant and the same thing happens. We go to the one in Redlands. Excellent service and very friendly and helpful and professional service<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I've posted about the dining experience at my local Applebee's restaurant before & have always had a good experience when dining there! The service is great, the food is delicious & the restaurant staff are all friendly & courteous to everyone! What more can I say! I'd give a 10 star rating, but it only has 5 stars!<//review>

<text>Saturday service was horrible. We jad a party of eight and one of us didn't get their food until we were about to leave after letting the server know numerous times. Also had to remind them about our drink orders not coming out. Never offered a refill on soda or water. This was our first bad experience unfortunately we had out of state guess so their experience was horrible< /text>< pics>

Okay so I love the food here. I come here every once in awhile with my friends or family. Everyone is very nice. My only problem is they always get at least one of the orders wrong, usually two orders wrong. It's not just this Applebee's, it's every one of them I've ever gone to. Don't know what the problem is. But food is good.</Review>

<text>Exquisite would be an understatement. Sublime, would barely scratch the surface. Nothing can compare to the delicious glory that was the 4 cheese mac and cheese with honey chicken tenders. And the artichoke and spinach dip? It was as if they plucked that from the garden of athena herself.

If i could live here, life would truly be good in the neighborhood.

We went here for lunch on Tuesday. We ordered soup and salad. It took 45 minutes, we got warm salad and cold soup. Completely unacceptable.<//Text>

<review>We ordered the French onion soup which was delicious. We also had chicken parmesan, the chicken was overcooked as was the pasta. We also ordered the chicken stir fry which was good. We had a little issue with the service, it took our server long periods to check on us and refill our drinks.
Update: Its been about 6 months since our last visit so we tried this Applebees again because I had a gift card and unfortunately had about the same results. Less than attentive service and the pasta was swimming in a lake of flavorless red tinted water.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Parking isn't too bad for an Applebees. Wich means yeah its cramped but not as bad as it could be. For just an extra few steps you can actually find it pretty easy. The bathroom is great, if you like to show off your privates that is. The sitting stall stare directly at the business end of the urinal. Lovely. But the service was quick, and nice food was what youd expect.< /Text>< pictures>

Magnifico!! That 3 course meal was excellent, or my choice of selection I must say. To begin a house salad with blue cheese dressing, mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and as my main course a 3 cheese penne. 😘 It was scrumpcilicious. So much so I had a need to make a new word to help me describe it! 😅😁 Thanks Daryl for the excellent customer service! 👍</text>

Not the best experience I've had, really understaffed, was there for 2 hours had 2 beers my wife had 2 drinks, because our waiter was covering half the restaurant. Our entrees came out 1hour and 23 minutes after we ordered. Only thing they had going that was a plus was the $1 Mai tais.<//Review>

We had a large crowd and the one server did good keeping up. The food was delivered in stages for the comfort of the cook. That seamed ok until it happened. Then it sucked. The food and literally everything else was great though.<//Text>

It was weird. I got a gift card for here because I graduated. The martdi  was very helpful in seating us. After were seated there was a waiter that we overhear refusing to help us. (maby because my husband shaves his head because he has a bald spot and has a goatee)  several of the other staff harassed the waiter for refusing to serve us. He then came out to take our order was was very rude and condescending  kept calling my husband a rock star and just being very condescending we were going to leave but ended up moving to another waitress section and she was great it was weird I just didn't expect it.  I guess its this White privilege just not used to being discriminated against.I dont know.<//Text>

<review>Happy hr is the best time to go.... all applebees are set up the same way... the center part is the bar area... the rest is what I'd call the common area... where " families ... with young children should sit".... the bar is MY McDonald's playground.... and I have no filter.... I drink alcohol, my mouth is worse than a sailor's.... if you want to bring your kid and sit close to where I'm sitting.... shame on you... you wouldn't want me to sit at the McDonald's playground and use foul language while your children are playing...</review>< pics>

Horrible .. the female waitress with the nose ring is the only nice person that works there. When I asked about the order the waiter said that's not my dept. I seen The order was sitting there. Horrible horrible horrible.  I seen the Manager handling food, and handling cash without gloves or washing his hand.< /Text>

My dinner came to the table almost 5 minutes before my husband's.   I waited so we could eat together and my dinner was cooled off by the time his arrived.
My six ounce steak was really a 5 ounce steak with an ounce of fat along one side.
It was tasty but not appealing with the fat not trimmed.</text>

We were pleasantly surprised by both the food and service at this location. The prices were very reasonable and it seems like they've stepped up their game in regards to food so this is definitely worth a visit for lunch with a group of workmates or a quick and easy dinner out.< /Review>

<review>Kimber is an amazing bartender!! She's very personable and makes you feel very welcome. And for someone who is from out of the area but loves Applebees it's great to have a new location and favorite bartender. Everyone should come for a night out and keep her company!!< /review><Name>robert stewart<//Name><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>I love Apple bees but my experience this one time was kind of disappointing. My waiter was not as attentive as I would have liked him to be. I think his name was Demetrius. I had a coupon and I tried giving it to him and he said wait until the end. Well, I ended up forgetting at the end because I am enjoying family time and have a lot of kids. If I was trying to give you something in the beginning of service, then it is your responsibility to help the customer remember. Also, I had ordered onion rings with my burger. Again, he "forgot" to put that down, and I was so busy tending to my 6 kids that I forgot I ordered onion rings and just ended up eating the fries that was brought out by someone else. He was unapologetic. He didn't bring my food out either, it was 2 other waiters that brought it out and I saw him chillen talking to someone. When we left he didn't even say bye or thank you for coming. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!
i gave 3 stars solely, on the fact that Appe bee's is my favorite restaurant.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dcabace7a0b6ef:0xb34484ddd0563f44<//Gmap_id><Rate>3< /Rate><Time>1473793180234< /Time><response>{'time': 1473865230696, 'text': 'Pamela Baker'}<//response><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< user>

They ruined all of the food by putting too too much pepper on everything. They even put pepper on the french fries. Vomit. And they don't have Coke, only Pepsi so if you want to wash down the pepper you have to drink water.< /Review>

Sat in the bar section and did not appreciate the loud female bartender. Wife had a good steak and she and I had mac & cheese. First bite was ok,  then as it cools down it got rubbery and very dry. Next time chips and salsa!< /review>

<Text>The Manager tried hard to fix our dinner and our server was very apologetic. Stars for that.
We were seated and forgotten, the manager took our drink order when he noticed, the waters came with lemon after requesting no lemon. There were hardly any chips with the spinach dip. We asked for a side of pico with it and they didn't bring the other salsa so we had to ask for that. The burgers were ordered no pink and they were barely cooked. The sides were not the ones ordered with the grilled chicken... The server and manager were horrified at our food... At least they were nice.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Text>They ruined all of the food by putting too too much pepper on everything. They even put pepper on the french fries. Vomit. And they don't have Coke, only Pepsi so if you want to wash down the pepper you have to drink water.</Text><user_id>116955842054805757547< /user_id>< Rating>

The food was great, but our orders were all messed up which isn't a big deal to me but if they were to mess up an order for someone who is allergic to anything they asked to keep off, it would be a lot of trouble. But keep up the good work guys!<//text>

The Manager tried hard to fix our dinner and our server was very apologetic. Stars for that.
We were seated and forgotten, the manager took our drink order when he noticed, the waters came with lemon after requesting no lemon. There were hardly any chips with the spinach dip. We asked for a side of pico with it and they didn't bring the other salsa so we had to ask for that. The burgers were ordered no pink and they were barely cooked. The sides were not the ones ordered with the grilled chicken... The server and manager were horrified at our food... At least they were nice.< /text>

Applebees is my favorite restaurant, I went to Applebee's 3 weeks ago and
the server that helped me was  really nice. For me she did her job the right way,  and I saw all other servers helping nice and the right way too while I was there. And Applebee's is my favorite restaurant because they do your order exactly how you want it and the server takes it fast to you.  You don't have to wait long time for your order at Applebee's. So I will go to Applebee's again.< /Text>

On today's visit there were 4 adults there to have a couple drinks and dinner. We had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks and than when our dinner was brought out they only brought out 2 dinners and the other 2 dinners came about 15 minutes later. By than the first 2 dinners were cold as we waited for the other 2 dinners. We spoke to the manager and she knocked off 50% of the total bill. That was okay but things like this shouldn't happen.< /Review>

Once again disappointed with the food and prices. It was 10 years since I last went and hopefully never again. 6 small black beans in southwest salad? Never had a bad French onion soup but it wasn't nice and disappointment with the American burgers.</Text>

Where do I begin, is it the badly over prepared chicken tenders my son had, which nearly chipped his tooth (exaggerating, but nevertheless that's how over cooked they were) or is it the microwaved french fries that were deep fried to hide their freezer burned taste. It quite possibly could have been the wanna be latin hipster model bartender who thinks he's a tough guy for talking down at a customer who simple was asking for a drink the server had yet to bring after 20mins of waiting (not over exaggerating that part, bartender nor wait).

I find it very disappointing that this Applebee's was very unprepared as a staff and operating business. The kitchen made several mistakes throughout our order and just sitting at our booth observing the room, it seemed to be, we weren't the only group who had a lack luster experience.

Fortunately, the manager and our server had some decency about them and attempted to correct the issue. However, that time came and went with Mr tough guy at the bar. They did decide to comp the chicken fingers and drink, which was considerate of them. But, by far, the reputation and experience had already been damaged.

If you happen to find yourself at this location, tred carefully at the bar, confrontational wannabe model may try to spike your drink or may just have you waiting aimlessly. If you dare choose to sit, beware of the teeth chipping chicken fingers and long delays with a lost staff who jist may need an overhual in efficiency... probably starting with the kitchen.

The wrong main dinner was brought to me.This happened to me a month ago.Although the stir fry was comped I was embarrased.Food is rarely warm.Servers are friendly.Wish a small salad could be part of a main dinner or a side..we have gone there once every 3 weeks for 3 years.< /text>

Applebee's tops our list for late night grub. The menu is the usual corporate faire, but at least it's consistent. More of a burger and beer place, but there's enough variety to please most.<//Review>

Food is fine, but you often can't get through lunch within an hour.  If you're in a hurry, this might not be your best choice.<//Text>

Got a waitress with Huge digusting tatoo across her chest, and a gay as hell manager sitting in next booth listening to too loud a music and singimg out loud. Order got screwed up by tattoo lady 3 times, food was pretty blah, good cheese sticks though, and they had no to go cups for a expensive left over drink. Not typical of most Applebees.< /review>

Under staffed for a packed location. It took 38mins before our order was taken. The food was warm but I've found that to be the same at other locations as well. I've never gotten my food HOT.  I've tried 5 locations I think I'm done with this chain.</review>

This review is long overdue, sorry about that!
On August 17th, 2014, my Honey and I set out for an early dinner. My appetite was leaning towards Applebee’s.

I had informed my husband that they had added some healthy choices to their menu since the last time we made a visit. Early this year we were unable to stay and dine because there were no choices of interest for him. So I was pretty sure that this time he would find something.

The host greeted us in a timely fashion. I asked the greeter if my husband could please view one of the menus before seating us, and that was no problem.
He did find a few things to his amazement.

We were escorted to a nice area of the restaurant, and quickly greeted by our wait.
A very cheerful young man approached our table and introduced himself as Robert. I have to say that his eagerness made me feel good and put a big smile on my face! I love it when waits are so cheery-eerie. We had a few questions regarding one of the entrees, so Robert took the initiative to go and ask one of his managers to come over and speak with us.

Within a minute we were greeted by Brittany, who had a bubbly outgoing personality. She explained that however, we wanted to substitute rice for more vegetables or another selection that they do their best to accommodate their customers. Their aim is to make sure that customers have a good experience and return.

My husband made a special request for more veggies in place of rice with his entree. Robert placed our order, and shortly after he walked away another manager approached our table and announced that the order would be coming right up; “In fact sir, I will prepare it for you to make sure that it is just the way you like it!

Long story short, when Robert returned with the food everything was perfect. The veggies were crisp just as he likes them and the portion was huge. The grilled chicken was melt in your mouth and seasoned to perfection! I had the Bourbon steak and it was equally prepared to my liking.

I must say, the food was delicious and we were treated like royalty!
The staff is fantastic at this location. The two managers, Armando and Brittany go far beyond their call of duty to give the best in customer service. Our wait, Robert, was extremely accommodating, delightful and polite.

Thank you all for such an awesome experience. Corporate is most fortunate to have you as employees!  Keep up the great work!

Just got out of this Applebees, the host Allan was nice, professional, and was taking items off our table.
Our waitress Aldema I believe that's how you spell it, she was on point, bubbly, and professional as well.
Our orders came out awesome and tasty. I got me a Red Apple Sangeria which was PRRFECT and ROCKIN GREAT, not over poured not under poured. I was seeing the manager be hands on which is nice, she is the one that gave us our food, she was kind and professional...
GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE and FOOD.
I will be returning to this location better than the Highland one.

The only thing I can say bad is that my son's fries was to salty, which it wasn't a big deal to me.< /Text>

<review>We got to Applebee's at 6pm, got a table right away, had to wait for service, kinda slow. Had to ask for menu's, then had to ask for silver ware. Ordered, took awhile to arrive, meal was cold ( ribs ). Our service was a 5 out of 10.
