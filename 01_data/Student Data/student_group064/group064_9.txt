<review>This is the only place I know of that sells Gorditas in the area, I have searched for other places even trucks and no one makes them. I 100% always order the Chicken Gordita, it's extremely affordable here. The establishment is easily accessible to people walking or driving up, parking may be a bit of an issue but I usually find a spot.<//review><GmapID>0x80c2b6605b3e33c5:0x422660dcf81e59e6<//GmapID>< name>

Very friendly staff and affordable prices. The street tacos were very delicious especially the side jalapeños and carrots. There are some outdoor seating available but the biggest issue is the limited parking spaces in this plaza.<//Text>

<Review>I'm from MN. I've traveled several states along with the DR. Came after a drunken night at the Savoy and they have the best tacos I've ever had and only $1.37. On top of that, they could tell I was drunk and unable to use the key to the restroom so they led me to the employee restroom and didn't try to cheat me out of my change. I highly recommend them.</Review><name>Virgie C. Perry</name></record>

<review>Food just ok + not a very nice part of town at night.We were on layover in Los Angeles. We stayed 1 night close to LAX because we were flying out early the next day back home to Canada. I wanted to try some local food. We chose this place based on the good Google reviews. We ordered 12 beef tacos to go. All in all, the food was just ok. We found the meat to be very chewy. Also, while ordering, when I asked whether they served fries, I got some attitude from the owner (?) who told me "this is not a burger place". Don't think I will be eating here again.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2b6605b3e33c5:0x422660dcf81e59e6<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I kind of loved this place. Tiny unassuming shack by the side of the road with a limited no-nonsense menu, outdoor seating, no alcohol permitted. We saw a bunch of locals come and go with their favorite orders - people order, eat, and leave. We got fish tacos, shrimp tacos, and a cheese quesadilla, perfect midnight snack after a cross-continental flight. Pickled carrots and jalapeños on demand. Love that the tacos have flavor and the quesadilla was soft and perfect.</text>

Friendly crew and excellent burritos tacos. The only place around to eat as late as 3 am. Sometimes they close earlier but many times they have fed me when the only other options were not available til 6 am. A sign says no alcoholic beverages but they never complain if i bring a beer to go with my dinner.</text>

The most delicious tacos and tortas. I haven't had good tacos like these in years. Asada ones are my fave. Friendly customer service always no matter who's taking your order. I always tip them bc their food and service is great. These are real tacos!< /Review>

<rating>3< /rating><Text>3/5 stars on a street stand scale. Lucky to have a restroom, so don't expect it to be super clean. The booths outside didn't feel clean and we're kinda crowded. Counter service with a smile. The rolled tacos were topped with queso, crema, aguacate, lechuga y pico- which is necessary because the rolled tacos themselves we're not the best. The shrimp burrito had good flavor and they made it spicy for me as I requested, but it lacked balance- no crema or mayo based sauce and I was really craving that to go with the shrimp and beans. It also didn't have any cilantro or lime based sauce, which would have brightened it up. The kids inhaled their tacos de asada.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Went in with my daughter to buy foot long  sandwich and I accidentally dropped my energy drink on the floor and I quickly picked it up before all the contents could spill out, and the 300+ lbs lady working there covered her face with both hands like she was quite upset and then got the mop to clean it, after she cleaned it, she didn't wash her hands before starting to make the sandwich I was shocked because she just mopped the floor and didn't bother to clean her hands. i told her i didn't want anything anymore ..she said that's fine with a bad attitude .. I left right away . I'm not going to this location again..<//text>

Wonder who manager or owner of this location is. Came in Jan. 16, 2020 at 8:30pm and ordered spicy Italian. After employee put cheese on the sandwich, he said both toasters were broken (I would not ordered spicy Italian if I knew both toaster were not working)  he puts ham and cheese in the microwave instead. I was totally fine up till here.  When we presented a coupon of free drink and chips, employee didn't know how to subtract drink and chips. Both employees took a while to figure out how to make correction. After that, he asked us to pay more than $9 so I asked spicy Italian is $6.99 and came out more than $9?? Two employees took another few minutes to figure out to make correction.  It was 8:50 when we finished paying (took us 20 minutes) and we were not able to eat inside because they were about to closing (it was so cold outside) when I was getting a drink, one of employee was maddogging me.  Two employees looks like high school kids so I didn't even bother to talk to them.. Good luck whoever the  owner or manager is.  I would definitely not come back here!!< /review></record>

<text>Absolute cheats ! They do not take BOGO coupons published by Subway. No notifications at the entrance or otherwise thatthey dont take these coupon and apparently their manager ‘ has asked them to not accept these coupons’. Unethical buch of folks serving this location. Shame !< /text>< Rate>

I ordered curbside pickup from my Subway App.  The sign in the window on the store says to call the store to let them know you are there.  I call and the woman that answers the phone says I have to come in to get the sandwich.  How is that curbside service?  I go into the store and there are three employees and two customers so its not like they were too busy to come out.  It really doesn't matter how busy the store is.  If you advertise some thing you should deliver that you state.  If not, take the sign down.  To top it off the woman made me sign the receipt.  In this age of COVID19 I think that is just stupid.  I will never go to this location again and believe it is gives the whole subway franchise a bad name<//Text>

I know it’s subway, but this was bad. For starters the bread was so dry it basically crumbled as soon as you touched it. I wish I would have noticed in line so I could have asked for new bread. Obviously the Mexican lady who barely spoke any English could care less about the quality. Next, the bell peppers were soggy, no snap or crunch at all. Super gross. Then, every bite of turkey had a lot of gristle in it. I barely ate half and threw the other half out.  Safe to say I won’t be back into a subway anytime soon. Especially this one.< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdc1f02464b83:0xcf8b212f79eb8bbb</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This Google listing advertises no contact curbside. However they refuse to bring it out when we ordered and paid on the app. My wife had to go inside were three doofuses were just standing around with the order sitting on the counter. Disappointing. Also if you order on the app for this location be prepared for all of your customizations to be ignored.<//Text>

<Text>This subway branch has a very rude employee named Luis. I didnt like his demeanor while he was making my food so I told him that I want another person to serve me. He threw my food and said to leave the store and threatened that if I dont leave  that he would call  security. I immediately contacted  corporate which is located at Connecticut and reported it. Lets see if the private owner will act on it as corporate had said so but I doubt that. This kind of  rude people need to be held accountable for their behavior especially when it comes to customer service. If they are overwhelmed or unhappy with their jobs they should not take it out on their customers.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<review>Went in to get a kid's meal and Tuna sandwich @ 8:20pm today, I was told they ran out of cookies and wouldn't substitute with chips. Their closing time is 9pm. I've been to the subway @ University park & spectrum center where they are happy to help customers. The staff here was rude so I didn't get theTuna sandwich. No more subway from this place.< /review><name>Jude Vijay<//name>< user>

<Review>I was referred to direct funding now by a friend of mine, and they were brilliant to work with.
What I liked was that you will be assigned to a specific loan specialist which is responsive and very straight to the point.
I had checked a few different business loan companies for rates & terms, but they seemed to have the best interest rate and was easy to setup.

I had delayed my business loan because I did not want to deal with the headache of all the paperwork. This company made it as painless as possible and answered all my questions on time.<//Review>< Name>

They offered our company a large credit line with a low rate, beating my bank! The process was very easy and I was able to do everything online. I was extremely pleased with Direct funding now and would highly recommend them to anyone in business!</text>

Direct funding now is easy to apply, and the employees are fast to respond to your application. I applied for my business loan and they got back to me in less than 24 hours! they are freaky fast to respond to your application. If you are looking for a quick response to your application, I do recommend you submit your application through them.<//review>

I took a look at a few of the 5* reviews from people that've written no or one other review - they were clearly fake.  Not about to trust a business that markets via spam and bolsters its reputation through fake reviews.<//Text>

<text>I am not a fan of all the calls companies make.
I get multiple calls a day from automated system and Robo collars. I’m on a national do not call list, do not call me.

I do my best not to support companies that waste peoples time and energy with such things. This company is one of those ones that hires companies or people to call people unsolicited.

Do not call me anymore. I suggest you don’t do business with this company unless you like companies that waste peoples time.

Just go another call today 2-27-20. Leaving a 1 star review yesterday was not enough to stop this company's marketing. PLEASE STOP CALLING ME.< /text>< pics>

We needed a loan to hire more employees so we can take on 3 new contracts we have been awarded. I received a few calls recently from Direct Funding Now and gave them a ring. I explained to Tim (the person that answered the call) what I was looking to accomplish. He went over the various programs and qualified me over the phone. What he said sounded good so I sent over what he requested and began the process. 48 hours later we had a few offers to choose from. 24 hours later we had funds in our account. Great simple process and Tim was very helpful.<//review>

Derek really helped us get out of a VERY EXPENSIVE way of borrowing money through our credit cards which was also hurting our credit score with the debt ratios. He was able to get us a short term loan to help with our immediate need for materials to complete a couple of jobs. A few months later he was able to refinance everything into a long term loan.

WOW never thought I would be able to obtain capital for my company because of my credit and I had a tax lien. They didn't promise me they could get it done but Kenny said he will give it his best. I submitted an application and within 24 hours I had an approval for $150k!!!! After a few proof of ownership docs the funds were wired into my account the next day! Thank for your hard work Kenny I will refer Direct Funding Now to anyone in need of Capital.<//Review>

Victor was on point, at time he came across frustrated but overall he did his job as promised. Now Janice! Wow she is definitely on point, extremely professional and definitely helpful!
I dealt with companies who promise and even after supposedly final approval turn around and don't fund the companies as promised. Janice made it happen while looking out for our best interest as well as her company's. I am looking forward to a long term relationship. I highly recommend Direct Funding Now.<//review>

No, No, No. And why isn't Direct Funding Now, a member of BBB? Go elsewhere. These people have only been in buiness since 2015 under this name. You can find actual professional people to do business with then here. Not once was there a phone conversation..except only in thier own minds.<//text>

Wow, what a great experience for us.......we were using a competitors funding with a 30% pay back off what was billed thru their system....it killed our cash flow.   So, when Direct Funding reached out....it was a welcome change on how professional and reasonable their programs are.  Took a few days from start to finish.  We got our funding......at a repayment level that works for us.  Win-Win.  Last, processing a loan is stressful under good circumstances with all the personal information required, I will say Amar was outstanding is help us navigate this maze.  Thank you.       If you are considering a business loan......don't hesitate with Amar and Direct Funding.< /review>

<Review>****scam alert****** please do not use this company, they're a fraud!!

Let's start from the beginning- I got called by a guy by the name Victor Smith from this company. He told me how the program worked (short term loans) and I told him  we were not interested in that (my business partner and I) that we wanted to get a long term loan to expand the store and buy me out, based off of the stores assets. He said they could do it but some of it is based off credit, so we had him run his credit and Victor said my business partner score was too low and what they would like to do is, set us up on a short term loan with a high pay back based off of our deposits. I told him there "no reason" for us todo that cause we didn't need a small loan but need a larger loan to buy me out and expand (around 100k) and if we can't do that, don't worry about it. Victor tells us we can't get that one at the time but what we can do is, get a smaller one (15k) with a payback of 3 months and it's just to establish a relationship with the bank and once they see good payment history, they will lend us the larger amount. And he goes on to say, we don't even have to wait the full 3 months, if the history is good after two months we can just get it refinanced at that point. I told him I would get back with him n a few days after we did our due diligence. We did-looked up the company, looked at reviews, looked on bbb and nothing came back/alarmed us, so we went with it.

So after two months go by, I call to Victor and said "hey we've made good all payments on time and we would like to refinance and get the bigger loan at this time". He said "perfect I'll have underwriting call u", after a few days go by and nothing from underwriting, I decide to call him back And he says "what.... they haven't called u, let me get on this right now". A few more days go by again and that's when I knew...... we got duped... it went from him calling us every day to get the smaller loan, and not calling back about the bigger one. See the problem?? If I was on commission I would definitely call back and make sure this big long it's taken care of... unless I know for a fact it won't. So, just to make sure we got duped/taken advantage of, I called one last time a a week later, and he says "man I can't believe under writing hasn't called u back by now" so then I test him and say "no big deal, I understand people get busy, how about u give me the number to underwriting and I call" he says "no this is my deal, and let me take care of it". I tell my Business partner about it and he gets very upset and says let me call him, and when he does, Victor acted like someone else...... oh his on cell phone. Wow!! That took the cake.

So I call the company to make a complaint or just to see if I could get somewhere else with someone (I already knew I couldn't but had to try) and speak to a lady by the name of Janice Cobb and tried to explain to her the situation, and she tells me exactly what we thought, that it is based off credit and they could do another short-term loan but not the long-term loan that Victor told us that we would get once were done with the short-term. I go on to tell her, that's not what Victor told us because the only reason why we did the short term was just to get the long term loan in the future, so just waste of time.

And lastly, we called a supervisor at. Yellowstone Financial (place that did the short term loan) to ask them if the did/or agreed to do a long term loan after we got done with this short term super high interest loan, and that said "no we don't do long term loans and we will call and speak to his supervisor to see what's going on" and we never hear from them as well.

At the end of the day, we got a loan for 15k with a payback of $21k and had to pay closing cost of $1300, so we basically loss $7700 on a 15k loan over a 3 month period. Talk about a "shark loan" at its finest. And, they take out $243 a day until the loan is paid back.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dcde8c69428351:0x6909a1a9c34a7ed< /GmapID></record>

<text>HOME! We love this parish community! Newman Centers are Catholic parishes associated with colleges and universities. This parish has no set borders and all are welcome. Our current Pastor is Fr. Paul Keller and he is a Claritian priest who is a warm, wise minister of God’s word and the Holy Eucharist. We have called this parish home for 26 plus years and we invite you to join us.< /text>< pictures>

I am a student at Fresno State and am originally from Texas. I love Fr. David and Deacon John. The church itself, although not my favorite style architecturally speaking, is beautiful although I wish the tabernacle was in more plain view. I enjoy when the organ is utilized in the liturgy. I wish that the center would be a little more active in campus life but realize that it can be very difficult. The primary reason as to why I regularly attend St. Anthony's over this center is the fact that first, the faithful seem to be disengaged during the Mass and you can frequently hear people having conversations with each other before, during, and after Mass. Second, there are no kneelers and it seems that Deacon John has no interest in installing them. Although this may sound trivial, the consecration of the Holy Eucharist demands the most reverent of stances from the faithful and standing up, as if we were in line for ice cream, does not seem very reverent to me. Other than that I am thankful for this center and am thankful for what this Church offers to the campus and community.</Text>

<Review>Visiting LA and went here with niece. Lady told me couldn’t use massage chair unless I paid $5 more and no hot towel on legs unless another $5. Indicated price was $25 or $30 no where did I see it posted. Also polish on three nails smudged bad after I left. Should have not tipped but I did. Turns out lady working on niece says it was $17 and Niece got to turn on massage chair, I got jilted.</Review></record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>Timing:
from the moment I entered the salon and signed up as a walk-in and the moment when I left with gel manicure an hour passed.

Pricing:
Average, for my gel manicure I paid $28 plus tip

Quality:
Since we are in Los Angeles, I would say that the quality of work is average for this price, but if I were in Europe, I would rated very low. Although the manicurist was a pleasant and friendly lady, neat.

Would I come back here again ? Most likely yes, I live near ￼by</text>< Pictures>

I super disappointed about the service. customers service is TERRIBLE. When i gave the tip to the lady her answer was "ONLY THAT" .
Besides that she was super rude didn't do a good job as you can see in the pictures. IF I WERE YOU... I'LL NEVER GO THERE..... I LOOKS LIKE I DID IT BY MYSELF......🤮🤦🏻‍♀️<//text>

<Text>I'm a client of B & J Nails for 6 months, but what made me write this review was the cleanliness.  As I arrived early I could see and I think it is important nowadays for what we are living, COVID.  Susan is an excellent professional I only trust her to make my foot that requires attention.< /Text>< GmapID>

Incredible result. They are so fast and yet manage to be proficient and professional at the same time. I left with a crisp, clean and very well done gel mani and pedi. Forsure recommend this place - go!!<//text>

<date>1577904777005< /date><Rate>1</Rate><text>I got acrylics taken off here and had a horrible experience. I don’t often leave reviews online, much less bad ones, but my experience was genuinely awful. They didn’t soak them first, they just pulled them off. It really hurt, and when I expressed my pain to the nail tech, she flat out ignored me. I told her multiple times that it hurt, and she just kept yanking. Two of my nails broke in half, and all of them were badly damaged. It’s months later and my nails still haven’t grown out from the damage. I have naturally really healthy and strong nails, and now they’re constantly breaking.

The nail tech just seemed to be in a rush to get me out and wasn’t friendly aside from damaging my nails.

I hate leaving negative reviews, but I would honestly really avoid going here. My friend who I went with also had a bad experience.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

On Saturday my girlfriends and I all went in to get our nails done. I opted for a dip powder manicure and I love it! Efficient yet precise. My friends received treatments for gel, pedicures, acrylics, waxing etc and we all were very happy with the end results. We had an appointment but you can walk in and they’ll fit you in quickly!< /text>

She was super sweet and I will definitely be back and will ask for her regularly. I found them off of google and have already referred a friend! Also, I will say that making an appointment is the way to go over walking in.</text>< Pictures>

I got an acrylic fill and gel color from Ken. He was extremely careful and precise with his work. He also was very communicative about what my needs were. As a result my nails look amazing! He wrapped my hands in a warm towel after which was a nice extra touch. Will definitely be coming back here.< /Text>

So I'm not from the area, but I expected what I consider to be a normal pedicure for back home. And home is Alabama. They literally had a foot basin of water that was BARELY warm and definitely cold by the time she was done. I was expecting the massage chair, foot tub with jets, etc. These chairs were in the shop, but not in use, I was definitely confused. Others had their feet in basins as well so I figured it was "normal". The nail tech was friendly and did a great job with polishing (thus why they got 2 stars). I was looking for foot and leg rubs and something more relaxing. This. Was. NOT. I honestly could've just asked for a toe polish because that's basically what it was with a cold water soak. Luckily I was only charged $13. Needless to say, I won't be back.</Text>

<Review>I used to love this place they listened to what you wanted and made sure you were happy with your results. My most recent visit made me change my opinion entirely. They pushed me from seat to seat, pushed extra services before I had even picked a color or said what I wanted, then rushed through my nails did NOT even clean my cuticles, when I mentioned it along with not liking the color she acted like I was inconveniencing her not trying to help resolve the issue.  My nails look nothing like I asked for... and at the end got pushed out of my seat while my nails were still drying so she could start another woman who just walked in the door. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.</Review>< pics>

I've been going here for years found out about it via LA natives. People can be polarized about this place but it depends on your expectations and what you're looking for. On the one side it's very no frills. On the other it's a fantastic deal and very quick so I love it. I also started getting my eyebrows done here a few years ago and for $7 I get more compliments on them than the $50+ job I used to get at Anastasia in Beverly Hills< /Text>

Nail stylist was rude. I had an appointment, showed up half an hour early and was there for almost 2 1/2 hrs. I asked for nail poish on my acrylics.. They persisted that I used the gel which i finally agreed to amd it ended up peeling off my nails within 2 weeks. I would not recommend this place.</Text>

I have came to this nail salon and have had many be respectful or complete attitudes. B has a extremely mafia bossy type attitude on in the phone like she can't handle her business. Christ and Julie are the only great and pleasant people there. I called yeSaturday to make a appointment and B told me to call tomorrow. I call today and another Julie have gave me a attitude on in the phone. I asked what Julie had available she asks me questions back. You don't answer a question with questions.
You females there need to learn to service and not talk about people aka your customers who pay you for services. WE DON'T PAY YOU FOR ATTITUDES OR TO BE TALKED ABOUT. I WILL REPORT TO BOB BBB AND THE COSMETOLOGY BOARD.<//review>

Waited 20 minutes for a lady to do my eyelashes and hated every minute there inhaling all that nail polish chemicals. The job was done really quickly and my eyelashes looked okay. The price was very cheap , $60, so I left $20 tip and did not hear "that you" for that. I followed all the rules and did not get my lashes wet for 2 days. In next 2 days they all fell out on one side and a few were left on other side. I guess that is why it is so cheap. Will never be back. Very low level place.</Review>

The price here is good, but last time they accidentally chipped my nails. The lady here was super super super nice and apologetic about it, and I don't love writing this review, but I think it's just a good heads-up to spend a few extra $s on a mani when needed.< /Review>

Good, decently priced, and fast nail salon.  It does get pretty loud in here so don't come in expecting to have a relaxing quiet day at the nail salon.  The work they do for the price you pay is great.  $36 for regular pedi and gel mani.< /text>

<Review>Worst experience I have had in a long time. Long wait, first of all. The woman was sloppy and unfriendly, she completed my mani/pedi in 10 minutes. She barely removed any cuticle or callous, but just focused on the polish - which was sloppy and uneven. My fingernails were filed thin and uneven. When I picked up the nail scissor to try to even them, she yelled at me.

It is a cheap mani/pedi at $18, but I had to redo it all at home. Would not recommend.</Review>< UserId.>

< Review>
I have been coming to this place for years. As it has been a while since my last visit, I was pleasantly surprised with some of the changes. The nail salon has a fresh paint of coat and management has purchased new Spa chairs !!! Need to know: they are no longer allowing tips on credit cards & they now have a new sign in process.  All walk-ins are asked to sign in with their name & service they are requesting.  My final tip is the prices have changed, mani/pedi (No spa) is now $18. This is still the best bargain in town. If you want an added bonus, ask for Tutu she does an amazing job. Have fun< /Review>

They upset more when one of the four that helped us made a joke saying my mother had to tip them all . I felt cuz we are Hispanic they assumed we didn't tip or something.... We actually value the hard work and,service anyone gives us. So that day Made me feel disappointed in the nail shop because they are very clean. But not just that one was doing my nails really fast while talking on her phone. Not sure if I give it a second chance.😣<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Cheap and consistent. Just wish they didn't require cash for a tip.</Text>

I made an Appt with Ti but the lady in charge that morning said very rudely that I had made no such Appt. It's sad really, because most of the girls are nice. It is very off putting that the ladies in charge are the rude ones. I also feel that I am  charged more because I am not Asian. I will be looking elsewhere for a better price for gel nails and better service.< /review>

My first time going to B&J nails was a great experience! I decided to try it for a mani/pedi because it's close to my house so an easy walk and had good reviews and prices online.
I called around 10 to make sure they were open because sometimes this isn't the case around here (listed hours online not matching actual hours of operation) and they answered pretty fast to let me know they were open and taking walkins and gave me the prices. I walked in  around 10:15 and they were able to help me right away. The woman who did my toes was a total pro and cut trimmed and buffed my feet and nails without any pain and got rid of a LOT (I'm ashamed to say) gunk! Another woman came to do my fingernails after my pedi was over and she was quick and thorough! I was finished with both mani/pedi and drying by 5 to 11 so I wasn't even there for an hour! Everyone there seems to be experts not only at nails but in customer service!
The only bad review I'd have is of a couple of customers there while I was that were constantly complaining. I don't care to go too deeply into it but both customers were over the top rude and were still treated with respect and patience.
I will definitely be returning here and see if the experience is always so stellar<//review>

Bad service and they are very racist towards elder people specially African American. Extremely pricey... I wouldn't mind paying 100 dollars if you treat me like anybody else.</text>

A very tidy area inside with very nice staff. They got my order correct no complaints there. My only one would be the tables to eat outside. The chairs seemed like they weren't screwed on correctly. I thought if I moved a little too much they would fall. Overall very good sanitation and good service.</Text>

<review>Food is usually fresh so thats good. The customer service is a lil sparse. Seems like no one likes their job here. Just because of their unfriendliness I usually try to go somewhere else entirely.</review><resp>None<//resp><userid>101865057922074864941<//userid><time>1604395853463</time>< rate>

It was decent nothing special. They get busy quick though. I only wanted a ranch it was given to me free that a plus. They seemed cool. But tiny small place so no matter where you sit you in somebodys face. They do offer outdoor seating though.< /Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>This is my 3rd visit to this KFC and each time there was  a mishap with my order.  I decided to not take that L. I called and spoke with the manager about a simple dessert cookie not to mention the last 2 visits within the last 2 years where something was wrong with my order IEA piece of chicken missing or my sides being incorrect. Management did not come out at all during my complaint he only spoke from his office to the workerand said, "give him 2 biscuits and 1 cookie". I have given this place 3 chances and on the 3rd strike they are out! I will no longer support this K f C nor the management.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2bb9577d0cb65:0xceae3a8e7e5f6750< /gmapID><Response>None<//Response>< rate>

First time at this KFC. It is very small. However very good chicken.  Tiny parking lot.  It's to try and find a place to park, however if you do I'm sure you would be happy with the food.</text>

<text>Disgusting conditions of outdoor (and even indoor) seating areas. For a KFC next to a golf course, you would think that they'd have better and higher standards of cleanliness. They also have little indoor seating space and attract a rough/ shady crowd.</text><Name>Vicki Lau<//Name>< pictures>

Place was "cozy" to say the least(u have to see it to truly embrace it) I'm not sure how the franchise industry works but in accordance with Current times this place needs a friggin touch screen or something. Was super no frills and they don't allow substitutions on the sides (once again may be the norm elsewhere, but I've never been to a KFC that didn't let u pick your sides). To be fair I didn't have a poor customer service experience the staff seemed nice and did thank me on my way out. Felt moved enough to share my experience, take that as you will.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>This location is a complete dumpster fire. Being a franchise store they don't have to follow corporate pricing, which means the $5 fill up will cost you a whopping $6 at this location, 20% more than TV advertises. The place is very messy and unclean as others have already posted. Trash everywhere on the floors indoor and out, walls with off color paint 'patches', the seats outdoors are mostly broken with one seat missing the bottom being covered by a trash bag. Attitude by the employees is poor. They aren't happy, don't smile and give you flippy answers. An extremely poor representation of this fine food chain. Corporate needs a shorter leash on these franchise owners.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bb9577d0cb65:0xceae3a8e7e5f6750< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Food is good and they have plenty of outdoor seating, somewhat limited indoor seating and unfortunately the drink selection is somewhat limited along with quite greasy food.< /Review>

< Review>
I went here one saturday at 10:00 a.m. right when they open, hoping to get the the first "batch of the day." I get stale wooden chicken from the day before which gave me indigestion. I've also been "shorted" on 10 piece orders a few times. Apparently they lack basic counting abilities here too.< /Review>

I really wanted to go to Joe's because of its quirky exterior and the commercials made it seem like the food/servings were fresh and abundant as well as a great value - sucker!  To start, I had the steamed shrimp appetizer for around $10.  I expected tiger size shrimp but instead they were the small cocktail size shrimp (10), so it was like $1 a shrimp.  For the entree we got 2 buckets of crab, having ordered one at first, we knew it would not be enough for two, we ordered another.

The seasoning is good, but the price is not right.  For the above and a pitcher of beer I ended up paying nearly $100.< /Review>

<review>The worst service EVER!!!! The servers and the manager are extremely rude. I am dying of thirst as I write this. Food is horrible here, avoid this Joe's go to the one in Anaheim. They also have no slings for car seats or are to lazy to bring. Couldn't believe they asked to place my daughter in her car seat in the floor. I will never return to this restaurant and recommend no one come here!!!!<//review>< pics>

<Review>People and service is great. But the food has changed. The fish and chips from the fisherman's platters was unimpressive. One fish stick... But tons of fried and shoestring onions. filler space.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Today is our sons 6th Birthday and he really wanted crab. On a whim we go to Joe's Crab Shack since we were all hungry and when i called there was no wait time. AWESOME! NOOOOTTTTT!!!!!! it took a few mins to get seated which seemed odd since the place was practically deserted which should've raised RED FLAGS! The service was horrible from our server! we had asked for numerous items and which none were brought to us by our server. We had to ask the other servers for items like dip for three of our children which took ten min to obtain ranch dressing. Also i had asked for crab crackers and they said that they didnt have any available. WTF???? no crab crackers at JOE'S CRAB SHACK??? Then i asked another server and they said they will get us a pair they were washing them. 15 min later we received the cracker. By the time we were ready to eat our food (us the parents) our 4 children had devoured their food and were on the play ground or what i like to call "a parents nightmare" almost all the playground equipment was made out of metal/steel and the ground was covered with pebbles. If you are wanting to enjoy a meal do not go outside with your kids to the playground. Kids were throwing pebbles and i ask our children to come back to the table since the only supervision is you.

And did i mention it was our 6yr old sons birthday?? I had told the server when we were being seated that it was his birthday. She asked which one and i pointed him out. ( we chose to sit outdoors in front of the playground, so the kids walked straight to the play equipment ) My husband mentioned it to the server and the neighboring server that was helping us, that it is our little guys big day. The kids and i were in the restroom getting the dust washed off from the playground and i was hoping they would sing "Happy Birthday" to our son  just like they did to  a neighboring party. Nope we just sat there waiting now for the check. By this time i am Pissed! We have been ignored and we had spent over two hrs there! We did not enjoy our meal since they we not prepared for customers needs. I asked for the check and let them know how disappointed i was in their service and that we will not be returning in the future. The manager came to our table ten min after i gave a server our payment. He said what can i do to make things right? I said what can you do? We just want to leave. He tried to give us a gift card but i did not take it. I told him why would we want to come back?

We actually had plans afterwards to go have cake with Grandparents and cousins but because the service was so slow we were going to be really late. So we just told them we will do it tomorrow. The birthday boy will have a treat and will be sung happy birthday to at Joe's i told them. What a joke! we ended up going to Yogurtland on the way home. We should've went to the Crab Pot in the first place!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Rick was very prompt and did the job efficiently. When you are dealing with an evading person and need to get the job done after sheriffs couldn’t hire Rick at the fraction of the immense cost you would have to pay for a private investigator and he will handle it for you and he went above and beyond during the holiday to ensure this was done before the New Year! Thank You!<//Text>

<Text>I've used different process servers before, and I can say Rick is a professional through and through. He's got the best rates, works the hardest, is the most responsive, and is the most thorough in his work.

He is NOT the kind of guy who does the bare minimum, gives up at the first sign of difficulty, and collects his check. He will hustle for you. And when it comes to his kind of work, you need people who'll go above and beyond.

I don't normally write reviews, but he's so good that I felt that I owed it to him. Two thumbs up.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1604099773254, 'text': 'Thank you!!!!'}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

If you need papers served, I would highly recommend going with Rick.

I'm dealing with my first small claims case, and I needed my papers served to the defendant. I tried using the sheriffs to serve the papers, but they told me that they tried 3 times, where they heard people inside with the tv on and the dogs barking, but the defendant refused to answer the door. After 2+ weeks, I received documents from the Sheriffs office that they could not serve the papers, due to the defendant being "evasive."

I then reached out to Rick... told him what had occurred and provided him my papers. Soon after he was able to get the job done.

He's fast, efficient, thorough, and most importantly.. He gets the job done! If I ever need this type of service again, I'm not bothering with the sheriffs. I will be going with Rick again.< /Text>

<text>When it comes to serving legal documents Rick is the perfect guy! Highly responsive. Handles the job professionally and sends photos on the spot showing the awesome job he does. I highly recommend him. I have tried other servers and no one was able to serve my deceptive partner. He was able to get him and in the right time. If it wasn't for Rick, i would have been still lost. He is always in touch, gives great feedback and you don't have to chase him for the documents or anything, unlike others! Look no more, this is the perfect guy for the job! Especially if you have no time. He would go out of his way to get it done right and save you. A life saver!<//text>< pics>

Rick is a class act. He came to the rescue of a good friend of ours, who's husband had been less than civil. Rick showed up to our house. First off he's  exactly what you would imagine a bounty hunter to look like. Rugged, Steady and can handle himself. Our friend just escaped a toxic relationship and was very nervous and fearful about serving her husband. Rick was very empathic towards her and reassured her like he'd been her friend for years. She immediately calmed down and felt 100% better after she handed Rick the paper work. Within a few hours Rick texted us photos of the husband in question reading the paperwork. It was all very quick and effortless. 100%, I will refer Rick for any process work I ever have, or ever hear of anyone needing a delicate matter dealt with effectively.< /Review>

<text>I live in the Bay Area and needed to file a motion in LA criminal court and with the DA. I called about 10 process servers in LA who either did not return my call, were too expensive or gave me the brush off. Finally, I found the man to get the job done! Rick was extremely responsive and timely -- and fortunately for me, knew exactly what needed to be done and completed the job quickly. He is very relaxed and professional, which was reassuring after talking to so many folks who couldn't be bothered to return my call much less help me. He communicated with me throughout the process and saved the day! I highly recommend that you hire him.</text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1527449536825, 'text': 'Thank you!!!'}<//response>< GmapID>

<Review>I 100% recommend LA County Process. The sheriffs made 4 attempts to serve over the course of a week, shortening the amount of time I had left to serve and I needed my papers served as soon as possible. Rick immediately contacted me when I made my enquiry, the very next day he came to pick up my papers and made his first attempt to serve. It took a few times, but Rick is relentless and doesn't give up, when he says he will get it done, believe him. Not only that, he talked me through the next steps of what he was going to do and made recommendations for myself as well as the courthouse impeding closure. He's given me piece of mind and I'm so happy with his service PLUS after care. THANKS RICK!< /Review>< pictures>

I work for an attorney service and we have contracted Rick for about 3 years now to serve our legal documents and he has always been very diligent and knows how to handle these fragile time sensitive cases he always keeps us in the loop of every situation. He is the guy to get services accomplished!!!</review>

I would highly recommend hiring LA County Process to "get your guy". The next time I need to have someone served in the LA County area, I will be calling Rick.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Highly recommended!  This is your secret weapon for court filings!  Rick can handle any court filing in the county, he knows where to go, gets there in time, and usually texts a photo of conformed copies before mailing the originals back.  Rick has done several last minute court filings, the same day, and goes above and beyond expectations!  One time he got the assignment at 11 a.m., printed the documents for me at Staples and he add exhibit tabs to a large motion filing, and he still made the 4:30 filing deadline.<//review>

I highly recommend LA County Process! Rick works very fast! I reached out to LA County Process on Friday night. Rick responded to my request promptly (within the hour). By Saturday afternoon the person I hired him to find was served! I emailed the documents to him as a PDF attachment.  After a  brief stakeout, he found the person I needed to  be served, sent me a photo of him to confirm his identity, and even sent me a picture of the service! He emailed me the proof of service document I needed for court.

He was very transparent about the cost. There were no surprises when it came time to pay.  I sent him the payment thru Venmo and the process was complete!

If the person you need to serve court documents to is ducking the Sherriff, call Rick at LA County Process! He'll get the job done!<//text>

Rick Waters located and served 4 Defendants within 24 hours.  2 Defendants attempted to evade.  1 defendant denied her identity.  1 defendant ran away from Rick, and there was a chase through a grocery store.  Rick got them all.  I highly recommend Rick, and have referred him to several attorneys.  He gets it done.< /Review>

A person I met at moonlight tavern recommended industry to me. He said I would really enjoy myself and would not regret it. He was 100% correct. I absolutely loved this place. The environment is what does it. Everyone was respectful and just having a blast. The bartender was cool as can be and very attractive.  The neighborhood homies showed class with respect ( u give it to receive it, every man should know this is rule #1). THE POOL TABLE IS  F....N FREE!!! "THANK YOU INDUSTRY BAR". This alone showed me this place respects and appreciates there customer's. F...K YA!!! I AM DEFINITELY GOING TO RETURN AS OFTEN AS I CAN SO THAT I CAN SHOW MY APPRECIATION AND HOPEFULLY BECOME A  WELCOMED REGULAR TO THIS AWESOME WONDERFUL BAR. Drinks are cold and cheap, But INDUSTRY BAR IS WARM AND WELCOMING.</Text>

I would give this place a one star rating, but I've never given anywhere that low of a rating. I walked into this place, looked around, and walked right back out. The place smelled like body odor, the only serve beer, and the crowd was full of undesirables. I walked in, and was greeted by stares. I normally don't care about that, but the vibe wasn't friendly. I've heard other people speak well of this bar, but that was not experience. I might try this place again just to give them the benefit of the doubt.</Text>

Very tasty; not too salty. I had the fish sandwich (grilled white fish). The dill tartar sauce is light and the perfect accompaniment, as is the buttered bun. The other item order was the grilled fish burrito. My partner really enjoyed the flavor. Again not too salty. Maybe a little dry for me. Good price point for the quality and the atmosphere on the patio. Feels like a little tropical patio. I added the side + drink for $3.95 more. Got the grilled zucchini. 4 thick slices with a nice char. I wouldn't have mind a little additional salt here, but again very fresh and light tasting. The burrito was huge. Everything was filling. This is a walk-up and order spot that delivers your food to your table. They did a good job of checking up on us without being overbearing. The patio tables were a little close to truly be six feet apart in my opinion, but it wasn't crowded, so we were able to distance ourselves from others a little bit. I would def return if I'm in the area craving a light, quick seafood meal.</Text>

Nice atmosphere and food. I ordered the fish burrito and the fish sandwich with zuchinni. The burrito was just what I wanted. Not too salty but filling. I would def come back here again. It's nice after being quarantined for so long. The waitress was also nice and warm. Also the weather was great.</review>

You can't go wrong with the smoked fish tacos - the tangerines and spicy relish with the cabbage are a perfect combo and don't forget to check in on Yelp for the free lemonade!  Go here!

< Review>
We love this place. We go here to buy their fish sandwiches, fish tacos and shrimp tacos. We love getting these so much we have yet to try anything else. But looking around from what other people get, their food looks and smells amazing. We tend to go bar hoping around Downtown Long Beach and we always go here to start our bar hop or go here after in the middle of our bar hop. The pictures are from different sittings.<//Review>

<username>Corey Munroe< /username><Text>So much food for the price. The broccoli slaw is great. It's not over saucy like some places can be. I had the fish and chips with a Cesar salad for the side. I couldn't eat it all. My friend got the swordfish, which was perfectly cooked in my opinion. I will for sure be going back.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8fU3WAjQXe3EpJA0beVqXbwgPe2INsZcy9--z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdNCzS4GuEfcfUWXlBsdUuvYWz-ArJgZyvk0lj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Date>1562798183750< /Date><userid>109056054282119878811<//userid>< resp>

<Text>Friendly staff, but not the place I would go to again for good drinks or good seafood. The only good items were the lobster roll, blackend fish taco, and the deep fried taco. The ceiviche had no flavor and is way too chunky. Hard pass on the calamari sticks.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

The crispy fish tacos were fantastic, and big! At about $4/taco, you'll get your money's worth. I also tried the gumbo, which has some really nice flavors happening as well. Both are a great pick, in my opinion.</Review>

In addition to that, the food was absolutely amazing.  I ordered the fish and chips AND my sister ordered salmon tacos,  and shrimp. Everything was flavorful! I like that it wasn't so crowded like the other restaurants in the area.

< Review>
We went here with the kids. The food was fresh, service was an OK pace. Employees were welcoming and nice. Dining areas were clean.
My husband got chicken breast and it was very smoky. I didn't mind but my husband wasn't very fond of it. You could tell they used smoke flavoring. I thought it was cooked very well though.
We got fish and chips for the kids and those were pretty tasty. The lobster roll was yummy!
I'd consider this spot again if I were in the area.<//Review>

I had the blackened salmon taco and grilled shrimp taco and out of the two, hands down the salmon one is the best. It was so big I had to eat some with a fork first before I could lift it to eat as a taco. The salmon was so flavorful and the mandarins on top added a sweetness that made it just perfect. I was definitely surprised that they didn't have fresh salsas but both were pretty flavorful. The shrimp taco was more on the salty soy sauce side... I wouldn't recommend over the salmon one.  There is plenty of seating the staff was friendly. Good place to go alone or with larger crowds. (I went on a weekday)<//Text>

Kale side salad is bomb. Not a big fan of the chutney for the fried calamari since it's just too sweet.
Plenty of seating options. Order, pay and get a number so that food can be delivered to your table. Great place to hang with a big group of friends.

<Review>The smoked fish tacos were absolutely amazing, delicious with the tangerine salsa and grill zucchini. Washed down with a good sour beer made for great time. They have a great beer selection and the lobster roll and sweet potato fries were wonderful as well. All for a very reasonable price for what you get.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdtTnrEFcNZ4WW3fjtCmbj51tfbfG2AeCuP0eq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7jOMSzOeEiwRLQ-F1ZLv0zxYpH2TcLanuIhYM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLRHDE9B3V4OuD0Do3xiXqztaDAflOt9voEe-7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

< Review>
This place is bomb but they changed the roll on the  lobster roll.  The bread was too thick and it was cut all the way through making it an open face sandwich.  It was harder to eat because of the bread and cut.  Otherwise it was a good meal and everyone was happy</Review>

I rarely give a full  5 starts,  but this place was awesome.  The food was fresh and delectable,  and the staff was friendly,  knowledgeable and very attentive.  We live cloud enough to walk to enjoy this hidden gem and cannot wait to try everything on the menu.

We got fish and chips w/ broccoli slaw and mussels over fries, with a cucumber lemonade and a Red Trolley Ale.</review>

Prices per entree are very reasonable (under $13) and both were cooked to order, fresh, and very tasty as well as filling. The kale side was absolutely stellar. The hipster bowl was great, very unique combination and very satisfying meal. Loved it!!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>The Good: Large portions so you get your money's worth. The fish, I had salmon, was very good quality. The different options for bowls, salads and sandwiches are really unique. Very clean restaurant as well. The salad was yummy and the dressing was very good as well. My mom ordered shrimp which was really good and well cooked.

The So So: I had the hipster boel which came with a large portion of hummus. I want the biggest fan of the hummus as it had a very creamy almost Mayo taste. Also, I wish the bowl came with dinner chips or something so I could eat the hummus like that instead of scooping it with a spoon. I also ordered a strawberry basil lemonade which I really did not like. It actually treated a bit like plastic and wasn't sweet. The salmon was a bit overcooked, but it wasn't too dry.

All in all I am rating this a 4 as it was just ok. I will probably give it another shot in a couple months and I'll update my post.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dd313c5c39586f:0x43eca0c0d599585a<//Gmap_id>< user>

< Review>
This place has plenty of healthy options but today, I just wanted a good sandwich and fries. This is the lobster and shrimp sandwich and it's served on a brioche roll and Chipotle sauce. It was great, warm and flavorful. It was very messy though because it wasn't really in sandwich form, but it was just set on top of two buns. So as I ate it, everything just kept falling off. I was a little messy by the end of it. I don't think it's really a problem though. You can tell it's that way for the presentation. Other than that, service was good, it's always clean. There is indoor and outdoor seating and it's right next to the Long Beach Transit Center. Very nice atmosphere altogether.<//Review>

<Review>I give them a 1 not for having bad food. The food is great. The lack of communication and customer service with the customer on deliveries is nonexistent. They use Grubhub like so many other restaurants and if they don’t have an item they don’t reach out they cancel half your order and tell a driver that still get paid no matter what to do something. I wish I still lived in walking distance because everyone would be eating together. Thanks for going the extra mile for your customers.<//Review>< Pictures>

< review>
My girlfriend had a huge hair wrapped up inside her seafood burrito and she bit into it.  When she realized it she was disgusted and wanted our money back since it was less than half way through our lunch. The lady working questioned Her and she was able to pull it all the way out of the burrito and it was so unsanitary.  The lady at the front tried to process a refund for just her burrito even though we were clearly grossed out and wanted to leave.  No refund was processed because the owner wasn’t there to approve it and my girlfriend began to get sick so we left.  Disgusting.< /review>

I wish we had one of these at home. It would become a regular lunch spot. The food was fresh and delicious and the prices were great. We had sweet potato fries, salmon gumbo bowl, and a sea bass combination. If we were in town longer than a day, we’d definitely go back to try some other things.</Review>

<Text>Good flavor on the food! Portion sizes were a bit small though 15 dollar lobster roll was slightly bigger than a fist.

Atmosphere was a bit lackluster could be due to the quiet time of day although you would expect lunch to be vibrant.

Decor is nice has a pub or drinking spot feel to it.< /Text><user_name>Doron Geyer< /user_name>< rating>

<Review>Was not sure what to expect and I guess it delivered. Food missed the mark to a degree. I had chowder (fantastic with huge lumps of clam), langastine and lobster roll (more a bacon and langastine roll - interesting but not sensational), and Cesar salad (somehow they got this horribly wrong/inedible - never had a Cesar I could not eat till now).

The atmosphere was nice/industrial. Service was friendly and place was clean. I went between crowds. Would dine here again but lower expectations.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMryjDnyOTT76fZkhHFd1hDhsAedYxUtKR4qS3j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdopOj06_nzuNkBJ3OGx5riHl4KzwTfjyY8-_i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCdKhOEuhkVzp9XO8VMkd-nBN6Y-YXuekvq2VK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGzLo2TY-yVWBuYOX4KZIrGEAPRsBxd7j6vNo2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyRHvaafeU0HV5P1-YiAzLMEnjECyr0Aq9putG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><UserId.>114760631680874803834< /UserId.>< user_name>

I went there for lunch with the Deacon from my church.  He got the daily special, seared ahi tuna and fries on the side along with their homemade soda.  The Deacon loved his sandwich and said it had a good flavor.   I got the fish and chips with a side salad.   The cod fish in my lunch was delicious and flaky.   The fries were both crisp and fluffy inside.   I finished out my meal with some homemade black iced tea.  It was a good and filling meal and I only paid about 15 dollars. I will be returning with a group of friends to taste their fare.</Text>

No lobster roll here, just a “lobster and shrimp roll” with only “6oz” of lobster. Only served warm so not the way you’d find it in the northeast. Save your money for a real roll.

Clam chowder is nice and thick!!!< /Review>

Their food is always SUPER fresh and delicious! I'm thankful to have this eatery so close to work as it helps me to stay on track with healthy eating choices without overpaying. They usually have a line but the line goes down pretty quickly so don't let that sway you from coming in. They are lightning fast both with taking orders and also bringing the food out, which is super helpful if you are short on time.</text>

A little pricey, but definitely worth it. Ate my lobster roll too damn fast but man was it good 👍Tried the fish & chips too and enjoyed them with their tartar sauce! Also impressed by the bacon blue cheese dressing.< /review>

Friendly staff, great food and a cute little place to eat. The environment was modern but with a twist to the fisherman's life. Everything I had to the clam chowder, to the fish and chips, and the refreshing cucumber lemonade didnt disappoint me. Will be coming back for more.< /text>

< Review>
This was my first time eating at Pier 76 and did not know what to expect. It was the closest restaurant around and the menu
looked pretty good and reasonable. I had the pleasure of enjoying their broccoli and brussel sprouts as an appetizer and lobster roll with caesar salad as my main dish. Everything surprisingly was well seasoned and tasted delicious. I cannot wait to go back and try a couple of other dishes on the menu. Oh there craft soda is unique in taste and one that I did not prefer as well as the strawberry lemonade.</Review>

No frills. You order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. Had the lobster roll which was good. Wish they would have a better wine selection, but I guess there is only so much you can expect from a place like this. Walking by this looked a good place to try. At 530 only two other people in here had me wondering. Tried the sea bass with broccoli slaw and sliced zucchini. Every thing was delicious and nice sized portions for the price. Large selection of fish choices. Many menu options plus craft beer. Definitely will come back again< /text>

Not just great fish but also. Good salads with chicken and lobster options. Recommend the fish and chips as a great option also the grilled shrimp is awesome.< /Text>

Easy seating...it was only 4:40 pm. Child 3 had the crispy chicken sandwich and fries...cooked to perfection and still steaming hot when he was halfway finished. I truly enjoy perfectly prepared fish and chips. Service was just fine.</Text>

One of my favorite places in Downtown Long Beach. All the fish dishes taste great and the broccoli slaw is awesome. Try the broccoli and brussels appetizer, which is also delicious. Great beer selection and fast service.</text>

<user_id>110850563843029061093< /user_id><review>This fast casual place is the spot for smoked fish tacos. While I was in Long Beach, I ate at Pier 76 Grill twice! I had their fried fish and grilled shrimp tacos. But the real standout was the smoked fish tacos. The delicious pairing of smoked fish with a citrus salsa made me return! I also had a side of sweet potato fries that were made perfectly. They also have a great selection of local beer that goes well with the tacos. When in LBC, this place is worth a visit.<//review></record>

Maine lobster roll was good, but the bacon detracted a bit from the delicate lobster. Clam chowder was great though. 10/10, would eat again.</text>

The food would have been better if there wasn't hair in it and if the person taking my order would have listened. I ordered a poke bowl with a side salad and got salad instead of rice. And there was a black hair in my food. Also we ordered the popcorn shrimp and were told we were lucky we got the last one before they ran out. What we got was a thrown together appetizer that literally had 5 pieces of shrimp and about 20 peppers. My husband had fish and chips which was the only part of the order that was good. All in all i will never waste my time going back. Good thing it was cheap and we didn't actually have to pay for the meal.<//review><date>1558988943233<//date>< Rate>

You order at the counter and they bring it to your table...at first I was concerned that the fish wouldn't be what I was hoping, I was very wrong! The Blackened Snapper with rice and broccoli slaw was not only cooked to perfection, but a large portion with perfect flavor - what a nice surprise - I will go back again anytime I may be in the area. If you are looking for some very tasty fish at a great price, this is it. They also offer a few beer and wines.<//Text>< pictures>

My girlfriend came here while on jury duty and talks about it all the time. So, when deciding on lunch the other day, we drove over from San Pedro. The casual atmosphere combines with a surprisingly fancy menu for a great experience. I had the fish sandwich. It was excellent; refreshing, flavorful, fresh. My girl always goes for the salmon Caesar, and for good reason. It's one of the best salads I've had in a long time. The blackened salmon is terrific. We'll be back.</text>

<review>This fast casual place is the spot for smoked fish tacos. While I was in Long Beach, I ate at Pier 76 Grill twice! I had their fried fish and grilled shrimp tacos. But the real standout was the smoked fish tacos. The delicious pairing of smoked fish with a citrus salsa made me return! I also had a side of sweet potato fries that were made perfectly. They also have a great selection of local beer that goes well with the tacos. When in LBC, this place is worth a visit.< /review>< pics>

<text>Edit:
3 hours later I still cough up smoke flavour. I guess it is not grilled but added smoke flavour like in bbq sauce.

Actually much better than expected! They are actually grilling the food! That‘s seldom< /text>< Pictures>

<review>the fish and chips are excellent. the fish was fresh and fried perfectly. Good portion of food.   clam chowder was just average and it  surprised me a specialty restaurant can't make it better than everyone else.  the staff is friendly and very professional.   the restaurant is clean and a nice casual dining place.   good for someone on the go and its quick and easy.< /review><Rate>4</Rate><pictures>None<//pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I've been here quite a few times as it's super close to my work. This is my favorite spot near my office in LB for lunch! Their food is always SUPER fresh and delicious! I'm thankful to have this eatery so close to work as it helps me to stay on track with healthy eating choices without overpaying. They usually have a line but the line goes down pretty quickly so don't let that sway you from coming in. They are lightning fast both with taking orders and also bringing the food out, which is super helpful if you are short on time. A bonus- they validate parking if park in the structure in their building. Amazing!</Review>< pictures>

<review>In less than a years time Pier 76 became a neighborhood favorite, out grew their original location (where several restaurants had failed) and moved to their present Pine Ave. spot.  That says something.  Casual (order at the counter), but creative and inexpensive seafood dishes.  My personal favorite is the smoked fish taco, but everything I've tried has been perfectly prepared and delicious.  Their focus is on seafood, but there are plenty of other choices plus beer & wine.  I would rate it an excellent value for the money.< /review>< rating>

I've been to Pier 76 a handful of times and so far it's always been pleasant. The food is great and fresh, the staff is attentive and the place is clean.  The fountain drinks they have are pretty good and they don't seem to have as much sugar as the main companies. They have a good selection of fish and I definitely need to try them all. Delicious!<//text>

Some of the very best grilled fish in the LA harbor area. Service is great tipping is not allowed. Not a big fan of that but it a self service counter where you order food and drinks and they bring you your food. My wife and I have been here about 5 times for dinner and happy hour and this place has always exceeded our expectations. The chefs know how to charbroil fish to perfection. A+++<//review>

Friendly service. Food is hit-or-miss. Near my work so I have been several times. I had excellent fish and chips here, but I had a plate of mussels and fries with so many shattered shells I spent the whole meal concerned I would get stabbed with a shell piece I had missed. Have also waited more that 20 minutes for an order to be brought out once. Each trip is a roll of the dice.<//review>

I like this place. The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. That said, they don't seem to be great at handling crowds. I tried going when the place was nearly full, and waited 45 minutes for the food. With that caveat, this is probably my favorite restaurant near the convention center.< /text>

I LOVE this restaurant. Great quality seafood in a casual setting, at reasonable prices.  I could literally order everything off their menu - can't go wrong.< /review>

I was in awe since a few months ago when we dined at Pier 76 Fish Grill. I saw a woman having Fish and Chips and I wanted the same.
When I revisited this restaurant on Saturday 23 March I ordered the Fish and Chips. I was very surprised by the taste and its now a new favorite dish. Pier 76 brought back a fond memory of a restaurant I recently visited to St. Kilda in Australia. I had lunch at Pink and Flake. They served the best Red Snapper Fish and Chips in the world!< /review>

We stopped here on the way to the aquarium and we were pleasantly surprised with the food and service. I got three smoked fish tacos and a Caesar salad, my wife got the salmon. The flavors of the fish tacos were amazing, both the fish and the combination of greens and salsa which included tangerines. Wow were they good! My wife loved her salmon plate. The staff was really friendly and very attentive which was awesome. We will be back here again for sure!<//text>

Finally made it inside to try the food, and it was a pleasant surprise! The food is so so good!

I had the Salmon with sweet potato fries. These guys really know how to use a grill! The vibe is really great too. Vintage long Beach photos, nautical theme objects litter the walls. The chairs and table are also very unique and interesting.

The outdoor seating area is spacial and had nice views of Downtown Long Beach even overlooking the Convention center and further away Rainbow Harbor.

The restrooms here are super nice. The staff are friendly and helpful.

I walked here so I don't know how the parking is. I can only imagine paid with possible validation. Park somewhere else and walk, it's worth it and it's also a nice walk.<//Text>

<Review>When is a shrimp same as a lobster?
It is when you get a lobster roll at Pier 76 Fish Grill.  That roll have so much shrimp in it  that they should call it a "lobster laced shrimp roll".
Let's move on to the clam chowder.  It got so much potatoes chunks in it that it should be called "clam flavored potato chowder"!
Lastly, I do recommend you skip the fish and chips.  You get over fried dry fish with regular fries.  👎👎👎<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<Review>Great casual atmosphere and good food.  The shrimp and salmon were really good.  We didn't have to wait long for the food.  The salad wasn't as for being called "Greens" didn't have much green to it.  Strawberry lemonade was tasty.  Glad that had a beer & wine to go with the meal.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I love this place. I usually stay at Hilton Long Beach for three weeks for work once every year.  I will eat at Pier 76 two or three times per week! The preparation of the food is as good as any sea food restaurant in town! But, the casual walk up and order and not getting dragged into a long drawn out dining arrangement is great!!</Text>

Good prices and good food, also nice atmosphere, but the UNISEX BATHROOMS ARE GROSS. You can't avoid smelling and stepping in urine. Also, there are no paper towels, kind of unsanitary since it's necessary to touch the door handle before leaving the restroom. Aside from the facilities, this restaurant is really good, from the healthy options to the refreshing craft sodas (ginger ale is awesome!). I would definitely recommend trying this place if you haven't been here yet.</review>

<review>Great taste and fresh fish.  The happy hour give good value too. But the staff is a bit rude. We ate there and have to leave for a show not knowing that we had to bring in the trays. They gave us a nasty look and make us bring in our trays. So much for courteous customers service. They just need. To tell is nicely that would be better.<//review>< Rate>

Very good and nicely prepared fish. Broccoli slaw was awesome. People aren’t that friendly but food makes up for it!<//text>

The old menu was better. Change the lobster roll back to the way it was!!  I didn't care for the changes that were made. New version of the lobster shrimp (that was the first mistake, langostino tastes completely different) roll is half the size, very greasy, not much flavor, no candied bacon - in summary: NOT worth the $15</Review>

Good amount of things on the menu without going into menu overload. Tacos were good, fish & chips fish pieces were nice and big, kids salmon was probably a little overdone, but I'm sure others might like their salmon done that way. Good beer selection. Our table was pretty wobbly, but didn't care enough to move. Indoor and outdoor seating. Will go there again next time we're in the area.<//Text>

< Review>
I had a salad with salmon. I forget the name but I believe that it was the Southwestern Salad (don't hold me to that) but it was a very good salad. The gentleman behind the counter was very nice and informative. I was expecting a bar when I looked at the restaurant online and kind of disappointed that they didn't have a bar but I thought that everything between the staff, food, and atmosphere was very good and I would recommend.<//Review>

Thought the pricing to be great as it was about $20 for my meal and beer. The same meal at a "fancier" restaurant would have easily been $30 or more... Especially if you include gratuity for a server. The sodas on tap were from Batch (I'd not heard of them, but my kids loved the root beer which was made from cane sugar). Would love to see many more locations of this restaurant!!<//Review>< Pictures>

We were waiting for Kings fish house to open so we decided to walk down the street and saw pier76.  We're so happy we decided to try it.  The food was great and a lot cheaper than Kings.  So happy with the food and service.  The Cobb salad and chowder were delicious.< /review>

Grilled salmon is really good for less than $15 and a decent portion. Almost forgot about the tartar because the fish was perfectly fine without it. Chose the broccoli slaw as the side and don't regret it one bit. Also ordered a small cup of the clam chowder on the side and had I had more room I would have definitely grabbed it in a bread bowl. Next time.</review>

Fun fish restaurant. Main dishes consist of fish, rice or sides such as kale, salad greens, broccoli slaw or sweet potato fries. Lobster roll was $13.95 and pretty good, not fabulous. Appetizer of fried green beans with soy sauce were delish! Fish tacos okay. Happy hour gives you a discount $2.97 fish tacos and $2 sides. Location right in the hub of things. Next door to parking garage, and they validate your parking ticket. The public transporatation stops immediately outside the front door.< /Review>

<review>Great food, fair prices, casual dining.  One ding as they do not have "Cocktail Sauce!" They have ketchup and hot sauce on the tables, and lemons on the counter, go out and buy some horseradish, so you can make this CLASSIC compliment to go with the shrimp dishes or the fried fish.<//review>< Pictures>

Order the fish and chips. They're pretty good. Crispy and very large. Came with two pieces and some fries. Fries are crunchy but a bit salty for my taste. Next time I'll ask for no salt. Service was very nice. The guy at the counter was cool. I would comel back.<//text>

Decided to head to downtown Long Beach and had a craving for fish and chips. Couldn't find a fried fish place to my liking but Pier76 had a great sounding menu of grilled fish and the like. It was a hit! It's a casual dining place but with a more contemporary class than your standard fish shack. It reminded me a lot of California Fish Grill. Perfectly grilled fish with an array of delicious creams and sauces to accent each fish. Good serving size and comes with buttery rice and choice of one side. Their fountain drinks have a selection of quality soda by Stubborn specialty soda company and two Izze flavors. I stay away from standard high fructose syrup sodas so it was a nice treat to have this selection. Prices are also reasonable for what tastes like good quality fish!<//review>

This is my favorite spot in Long Beach. The Fish tacos are grilled, made from high quality fish that has a excellent mandarin orange sauce. The fish plates are a hefty size if you want something simple. Their Poke is my favorite because of the sauce, sliced avocado and chips that come with it. There is no wait, you order and grab a table, although it can get a little busy during dinner. It's a must try if you want something quick and healthy. Staff is totally awesome too.< /Review>

Not bad for a quick, basic, affordable, nutritious seafood lunch. However,  the fish was overcooked, dry, and tough. If there's an opposite of gourmet,  this was it.</text>

I found the food to lack some flavor, but the sauce that came with the food sure came in handy. It helped cover up the charcoal charbroiled flavor.

I came with two friends and let them know to check in! By the time my third friend paid for their meal, the waitress with the glasses wasn't thrilled. Oh well! Thank you Yelp!</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Always great seafood. Lines are long(very popular place), but move very quickly. Indoor and outdoor seating. Order at the cashier, receive a number, get your own drink, and the food is delivered to your table.</text>

Enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. The food could use more seasoning. Some tasted a little bland.  I will be returning because of the atmosphere and the location.</Review>

The place smelled like old fish. Lobster roll had only two pieces of lobster - it had 80% shrimp, 10% lobster. French fries were under cooked/raw. Their broccoli slaw was beyond bad for a "premium" side.</Text>

Food was delicious! And quick too. Craft sodas we're very good. Clean and good food.  Only complaint is the parking, but it's downtown Long Beach so... It was expected. Was suprised at the good pricing!<//Review>

If you're looking for "healthy" fast food give this place a try. It's a great spot for lunch or dinner with a pretty good wine and beer menu. Convenient parking with free validation as well.</Review>

<review>ABSOLUTLY without a doubt your fresh fish seafood awesomeness with a quiet atmosphere to match the smooth nice list of IPA beers and a menu that is designed with tastes to make your mouth water just thinking about your favorites. Mine the grilled Zucchini , sweet potato fries and the grilled fish fillet sandwich has the best aioli and onions. So Satisfying.< /review>< Rating>

<review>Had the calamari, grilled salmon, and the live Maine lobster. The calamari was tough and chewy: an appetizer I would never order again from here. The grilled salmon was definitely grilled, but to the point where the salmon was dry and the char was overpowering: might have been a bad chef for that day. The lobster was a positive experience. The meat had a nice sweetness to it that you don't normally find in lobster at other restaurants: could be just good quality lobster to begin with. Based on the calamari grilled salmon experience, both of which are the 'bread and butter' for seafood spots, I do not suggest even trying this place as just a block away are other already better established seafood places.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dd313c5c39586f:0x43eca0c0d599585a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was in Long Beach on business and found this excellent lunch spot.  I ended up eating here almost every day and tried something new each time.

<Text>Pier 76 is the best fish grill place in long beach with the most heart to serve fresh seafood without fuzz.

I've tried various different type of grilled fish and they are all fresh and delicious.  their lobster roll is also very delicious, but the portion of the roll is not enough to fill anyone up.  The roll is really more like an appetizer.

their watermelon lemonade is also very tasty.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The Shrimp & Lobster Roll was amazing. If you really want to taste the Lobster, don't ask for any sauce or aioli in it. The amount of Lobster was perfect for the price. And the Coconut Shrimp Ceviche Tostadas were only $6 during happy hour and you get 2 Tostadas and they had a good amount of shrimp on it. Fresh and delicious and the service was comfortable. Definitely going back.</review>

<Text>No table service, better lunch than a dinner outlet. I had langastino and lobster roll. No shortage of bread, but short on protein.  Had a chowder and beer. Dont run low on beer, as you will leave the table to fetch your own refill. Regardless of the length in the line.

<Review>I travel the country for my job and eat out for dinner Sunday through Friday night. With that being said, it is really had to find a place to stand out, this one did. First and foremost the service is phenomenal. I was greeted with a smile by Kelsey , who helped me out with food and a beer that is just what I wanted, even though I did not know what I wanted. I ordered the crispy calamari as a appetizer which I in the top 5 I have had in the country. For my main course I order the Live Maine lobster and white cheddar mac and  chesse, can we say bomb dot com........ I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting or anyone local!! Once again phenomenal service,  great food, and at a great price!! You will not be disappointed!!< /Review>< resp>

< Review>
I had the lobster roll and it was really good. I lived in Boston for some years and even though it isn't as good as an east coast lobster roll, it was tasty.</Review>

The food is fantastic and the staff is super friendly! Can't believe that this place isn't packed the whole day long, but actually kinda glad it isn't. Shhhh... Don't tell anyone about this hidden gem. Let's keep this our secret, okay?<//Review>

<Review>Went there last night for dinner with my wife ended up getting two lobster rolls we had them before they where great this time around not so such. I worked with seafood for 6 years what came out on the roll was lobster that was overcooked or that had been waiting in the freezer for days. The bread was a bit hard too not very happy this time around.<//Review>< pictures>

Ordered the longastino and lobster roll. Apart from the 2 small pieces of lobster, it was all longastino. Additionally, my fault for not noticing that the roll came with bacon in it, but  the flavor of bacon really killed it for me. It was inedible. The place was clean and the zucchini side and sticky green beans were good.<//text>

<Text>-1 star for the soggy paper presentation.

The fish was fresh, and very tasty. I had the grilled barramundi, with broccoli slaw as my side. I substituted house greens (salad) instead of rice, which added $1.50 to the price. They have draft craft sodas, the diet cola was decent.

Everything was very tasty, until I got towards the end of the meal and realized that the paper liner had become all soggy, and I had most likely been eating tiny bits of it. It was quite a bummer at the end.

Get some plates.<//Text>< Pictures>

Don't order the Cobb Salad if you expect the Bacon they claim comes with it to actually be on it. Oh, but as a consolation prize they give you an entire diced up onion, an onion by the way that ISN'T supposed to come on it.
My wife liked her fish tacos okay though, so not a complete disaster.<//review>

Sign on front door says open at 11:00. We stood outside till 11:08 with employees and managers walking around inside sitting around.   No one even came to give us a heads up on when they would unlock their doors.   They just watched the 6 of us stand there waiting.  We went to Rockbottem next door where we were seated right away.< /Review>

It was okay, but the lobster did not taste fresh, and it was the size of a small child. Lots of other options in the area worth spending your dollar at over this place.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Great food. Great service. Tip: the Ginger Beer in the soda machine is really Ginger Ale nonalcoholic. But they do have a good beer selection.<//Text>< Name>

<Review>Never been to Long Beach and took the advice of Tripadvisor to find this Great place. Greated as we entered by Justen and he explained the daily specials .Of course we had many questions and he did a SUPER JOB answering them. We started with the special, Smoked fish tacos, KILLER GOOD!!. Should of stopped there but I orderd the fish and chips and my wife ordered the mussles. Way more than we needed to eat but we did anyway. Not a place to miss for a great meal. Great location easy to find.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

We have the grilled salmon and trout plate. The kids got fish and chips. Everything was perfectly cooked, juicy, and seasoned. The only complaint I have of this place is the paper they used to line the plates. It was rather tedious picking the paper out of the rice. That was a pain.</review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>Came here with some friends for dinner and I got their lobster roll and a beer. Pretty nice selection of craft beers but the lobster roll, while pretty tasty, was ultimately a bit too rich for me: the bread is buttered and toasted, and there was a lot of mayo/sauce with those lobster pieces. Also, the the crispy fried onion bits things had an overly sweetish taste that I wasn't all that thrilled with. By the time I got to the end of the sandwich I was feeling kind of bleah. This is a nice-looking place and the people working there were great, but I think the food can be a bit hit or miss, based on my experience and other reviews. I'd probably come back and try something else, though, as I'm a fan of this concept for this area!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Wow, how did I not know of this place sooner? GREAT prices for great craft meals. I had the salmon burgers that was perfectly flavored with Chipotle aoili and poke sauce. I couldn't get my eyes off the mussels my coworkers had. A generous portion of mussels over a bed of fries. They had leftovers from a lunch portion! And the craft sode fountain was worth the combo upgrade. Can't wait to try more on the menu.< /review>

<Text>I went here every night for dinner during my stay in Long Beach! Their craft sodas are delicious (and made with cane sugar! Yay!) They even have ginger beer! My personal fav. The service was great and always fast even when the place was crowded. Everything is reasonably priced as well. Bonus! I would definitely recommend eating here anytime!< /Text>< username>

Food was great, the cucumber lemonade deserves 5starts alone! The customer service was what held them back from 5 stars.</Review>

< Review>
Came here for an early family lunch after a harbor cruise and were delighted with the find.

1) Free 2 hours parking validated by the restaurant at the lot that's about a 5ft walk away.

2) I was worried that it might be difficult to get a table for 10 but the staff had pulled tables together and placed reserved signs on them for our group.

3) Ordering food was quick and easy, despite the size of our group. You order up at the counter and they have a nice vintage chic sea type seating area. Very cozy and aesthetically pleasing, like SF restaurants.

4) Free regular lemonade if you check in on Yelp! It was really tasty. Or you can choose from draft beers or Craft Soda from the fountain.

5) Food came out pretty fast. (I wish they would've given cutlery to everyone though.) All the dishes were large serving sizes so we ended up sharing quite a bit. Everything I ate was delicious! The clam chowder, calamari in a sweet tangy sauce with a carrot type coleslaw. The lobster roll was the only entree that came with a free drink. The beer battered fish and chips was awesome, and the fish didn't taste too heavy despite being fried. The grilled fish entrees with rice and sides were very tasty and good healthy options. No one ordered the Maine lobster at our table, but other patrons did and it looked awesome. We were all very pleased with the food.

6) Service was great. Nice, clean place. Not too loud and good central location. Nice patio seating to be used in warmer weather.

7) Overall, fabulous experience.</Review>

Fish and chips was just two pieces of fish. The fish that was there was mostly skin.

LOUD, LOUD, LOUD! Over-priced, average quality seafood served in a warehouse setting. The noise during peak dining rush is incredible, due to every sound being reflected off all the hard surfaces, forcing everyone to raise their voices to cut through the din, which only makes it worse.</Text>

< Review>
No, the lobster roll is their take on the classic. Throwing in Langostino and the bacon makes the dish a winner for me. Drink and a side brings it to $17, but I believe the quality justifies the price. Lots of seafood options, and a chicken dish or two at this counter service spot.</Review>

I'm not exaggerating when I say they have the best fish tacos on the planet. Try them with a little Sriracha suace. Protip, get the 2-taco combo and add a 3rd taco for $2.75.<//Review>

<review>This is one of my favorites in Long Beach! Their brussels and broccoli is a must have, ahi poke is so yummy, clam chowder outstanding, fish tacos so good, whitetail delicious, and langostino and lobster roll is to die for... Yeah, I have been there a few times... Great food and good prices!< /review>< Pics>

Wow! For under $25, I dined and ate an incredibly quality, healthy meal (dinner). This included grilled salmon, rice, grilled zucchini, bottled water, and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc (ok, maybe not so healthy *smile*). I’ll be in Long Beach for the next 9 days for work, and plan to return often. And the service was excellent! Thank you!</text>

I'm still tryiing to figure out why this place is rated so high. The food is mediocre at best and the service is not very good either.  We ordered fish and chips, the fish was extremely greasy.The fries we got were so salty I couldnt eat them. The calm chowder soup was very thick. The ice machine was broken which were weren't notified about when we ordered our food and drinks. Towards the end of our meal a staff member came over a offered "a refund or something ". Don't offer a refund, when Im done wirh my meal and pretty much leaving.</text>

This is my go-to spot for blackened salmon salad and the best broccoli coleslaw you've ever tasted. Plus, they have a descent craft beer selection of both local and regional beers.</review>

<text>I heard about this place so I made a rare trip down to Downtown L.B. to try it out. For one thing finding parking was lousy. Once I found a parking spot I had to step over several homeless people sleeping on the sidewalk to get to the restaurant. The fish I ordered was over cooked and dry. The bread was slightly stale. Food was overpriced for what this place is. I'll never go back.< /text></record>

My friends and I had the lobster roll, mac and cheese, oysters, and the broccoli and brussels sprouts.
I am not sure why the lobster rolls were so highly beloved. for me, it was just okay. I felt like it did not come all together for me. Oysters of course were good and big as well. The mac and cheese was super disappointing. I felt that it was dry, congealed looking and tasted like it lacked true flavor. I actually really enjoyed the broccoli and brussels sprouts. I thought it was well cooked and well flavored. If i were ever to come back, it would be for that. I also had the cucumber mint lemonade which i felt had great flavor, was refreshing and great combination of sweet and sour.

The best part about this place is the alcohol, the drinks, atmosphere inside and out and the broccoli and brussels sprouts.< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Our family was visiting on vacation for 3 days and went here twice!  Quality food for a decent price.  The sides are awesome (sweet potato fries, broccoli and cabbage slaw, brussel sprout and broccoli-quick fry, strong flavor).
Very casual, you order at the front, seat yourself, your food is brought out to you and they clean the table afterwards. Very nice and clean inside, friendly servers.  The fish was cooked perfectly when we went friday night at 4pm when the place was empty, and slightly overcooked when the place was bustling on sunday night, but good all the same!< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>They have a grilled mahi mahi with bleu cheese, which I hate, so I asked if I could have the apricot glazes instead. It was seriously to die for. Such big portions of rice on the side and a bunch of perfectly grilled zucchini. They did just such a great job. My companion ordered grilled salmon with rice and salad and his was cooked to perfection as well. Can't say enough of this super cute restaurant and perfect food. Words aren't enough. Please try it. OH! And the broccoli and bussels. Hate brussels but the broccoli..oh man. :)</Review>< pictures>

<review>Soo so good. It's rare to find a fast casual place with lots of seafood choices. I find most sit-down seafood restaurants intimidating because I don't know much about seafood.

I had grilled tilapia with grilled zucchini as my side. I paid extra for brown rice and even that tasted extra good - I think they cook it in something savory. The tilapia came with an aioli that presented me with a dilemma: eat the deliciously grilled tilapia without the yummy decadent aioli or eat the aioli with the tilapia and miss the perfect solo flavor of the fish. I might have had some aioli-covered fork as a third choice.

I added a side of the kale tomato salad. Heads up: when ordered a la carte, the side is huge. Almost entree size. Also delicious.

Can't wait to try more things!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I had Yellow tail with rice with brocoli Coleslaw on side, Scallop & Shrimp Ceviche, and 16 oz clam chowder. $30.47 tax include with soda.
Awesome food, first tried yellow tail and became my favorite fish, and ceviche is perfect with Nacho chips. It was like pico de gayo.
Thanks for explaing to us, unknown chashier!</text>< pictures>

Average.  The clam chowder was just water down. The fish taco was ok. They should use two tortillas and place it in a plate not a bucket tin bowl of some sort.< /review>

Not bad!  Good ambiance with indoor and outdoor dining.  Food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  The Clam chowder was pretty good.  The grilled Fish Sandwich was more the size of a burger with a lot of greens on it.  But overall not bad.</review>

(Translated by Google) When I cut down that lobster sandwich with handmade beer, warm clam chowder, and lobster that suits the warm and dazzling weather of Long Beach, I will say'Oh, this is USA, this is LA, this is Long Beach!! In particular, the lobster sandwich is a higher compatible version of luke's, especially the French toast containing the lobster is a beautiful collaboration of milk and eggs.
