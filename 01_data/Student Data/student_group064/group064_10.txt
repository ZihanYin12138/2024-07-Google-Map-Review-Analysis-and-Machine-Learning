<review>This Latin American gem reminded me that yucca fries, pork chops, and Chonuts are but a small piece of what this region has to offer. And the staff are friendlier than any in-home service. Or maybe that's just the pandemic talking.<//review>< Pictures>

I must say, this place is pretty amazing! food is very unique and very tasteful, Their Tomahawk is totally the best pork chop I've ever had, definitely one the main Stars of their menu. Staff is fun and friendly, Adriana, Lourdes and all the guys took great care of us every time we went there (which was an awful lot..ooops!) My only complain is that after we drank all your Coors Light on tap, we never saw it again! j/k

Definitely recommend this place, and we WILL be back! ;)<//text>

Great presentation, they have over 300 pictures on their website: this is actually what made me want to try this restaurant. I visited today for the first time with my coworkers after work and every single item that we tried was delicious, the service is also outstanding, the atmosphere is great, I highly recommend mas fuego. The 3 leches and the ceviche were especially yummy!</Review>

<gmapID>0x808fc77d3707de07:0x7404a76f81c57e5a</gmapID><Review>Pretty generic. Small menu. They were clearly understaffed when we went in at 3pm on a Sunday, but they did their best, we've all been there. The chips and salsa trio was okay. The salsa was not spicy. We ordered a caesar with salmon. The dressing was a creamy caesar dressing, which is not our favorite and the salmon was undercooked 😬 Also there was a child that was screaming a majority of the time, so that always makes things A THOUSAND TIMES WORSE< /Review>< time>

I was fortunate enough to try out Mas Fuego the first time during a training session for work. We were the first customers of the day. The service was great. I ordered the three street taco meal with el pastor. It was cooked well and had tons of flavor. We also ordered the caso dip with chips and I have to say, the chips were awesome. They had a slight amount of chili powder sprinkled on top which not only made them look appetizing, but made the taste buds scream for more. Overall the experience was great. They had outdoor seating and premium food. The reason that I docked them a star was only because after drinking two soda waters, I had to use the restroom, which was difficult to say the least when the lights were off and only controlled from the back somewhere. I politely asked for them to be turned on, twice. They just seemed to forget. Other than that it was worth going back.</review>

Chips and flan were okay. Alpastor was subpar, tasted like bologna dipped in mole sauce. The “double stuff taco” was soggy corn shell in a chewy flour tortilla with beans and 1/10th an avacado. If that was the item they are know for, not impressed.<//text>

<Review>We really liked this place. Other than the limited menu, it was pretty much perfect. Oh, and it'd be great if they offered free chips  and salsa.  A Mexican place that charges for chips is dumb. Their double nachos were GREAT!</Review>< pictures>

This was a surprising and pleasant find. We were wondering Pacific Commons looking for something to eat for lunch. We hadn't been to Mas Fuego before so we decided to give it a try. Asked the hostess what she recommended for lunch. We went with her suggestion and had the La Taqueria two tacos (popular). Let me tell you they were huge and stuffed with so much ingredients. A single taco could be enough for some. Don't be too concerned about the price. You get a lot of food and dishes can be shared. The place is well decorated with a large bar. I imagine this place could be a lively hot spot at night if it weren't for COVID restrictions. Definitely recommend this place if you have not tried it.< /Review>

I saw Mas Fuego was opening up again for seating outdoor and I decided to check it out. The seating outside was not only great experience because of the food and drinks, but they have tons of space and tables and customers were at a good distance from one another. It was nice to be able to enjoy some fresh air and not have to worry about being too close to anyone. Definitely check out this spot if you're craving some good Mexican food! Glad to see that this restaurant was able to open and still be socially responsible! I'll be visiting Mas Fuego more and see what else they can offer!<//review>

<text>TWO THUMBS UP. I currently have severe food restrictions due to allergies, and yet At time of Curb Side Pickup Mas Fuego was so particular about making sure our party's appetizers and taco entrees were prepared safely and according to our needs. They were so attentive to my needs, involving manager to make sure everything was smooth. On top of that, the food was delicious. HIGH FIVE TO MAS FUEGO.
Highly recommend!<//text><time>1588499139571< /time></record>

Wow wow wow. During this COVID time period, it's been tough to find good service, good food, good everything!

From beginning to end, the staff made our dining experience top notch. We were seated outside - 6 feet apart from any other patrons. Since it was our first time dining with Mas Fuego, our waitress - shout-out to Adriana!! - gave us some awesomely thorough recommendations.

We started off with the guac and chips (salsa was given, on the house), and the freshness of the ingredients in the guac really came through. As for mains, we ordered the carne asada burrito (it was HUGE) and the octopus (omggg soo tender, highly, highly recommended). And to finish everything off, we opted for the Chunuts (churro donuts!), which Adriana also gave to us on the house! Who doesn't love churros? Or donuts???But man o man. Churro + donuts?! Together?! Superb experience. Topped everything off with two margaritas, original and passion fruit. Loved it.

Will 100% return. 5 stars!</review>

<Text>Fremont could really use a good new Mexican restaurant unfortunately this is not it. 1st impressions are everything the restaurant and the staff were good but the food was hit-and-miss. The chicken mole a was tasty we had asked for more mole sauce because it only came with a very little on the bottom of the plate. The  Tacos were not good . Tacos should be the easiest thing to get right.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I have been driving by Mas Fuego a couple of times now and have been wanting to try it mostly because of the name. If their name is lit so is there food; right? When I went their staff was very vibrant and friendly even though it was a quick pick up. I decided to order their Mas Fuego Ceviche and an Elote. I would definitely recommend it reminded me when I was back in middle school and the elote man would come by and all my friends and I would order them. Definitely 5 stars; see y’all again very soon.<//Review>

<text>I'm sorry, but this place is hella whack. Food is cold the Elotes was horribly over cooked and dry. The rice in the burrito wasn't cooked all the way. Everything is overpriced. I really don't see how this place got 4.5 stars.< /text>< time>

I was so happy to find out that Mas Fuego was on Doordash! I got to try out the restaurant before the pandemic and I was impressed by the variety of options and the quality of the food. I was very happy to learn that they were doing delivery and takeout even when a lot of places were closing down. If you're looking for a local another local restaurant to support and try out, I highly recommend Mas Fuego. The quality and the taste of the food that I got delivered was just as good as if I had sat down at the restaurant and ordered. My favorite is the la taqueria tacos with carne asada -a must try! Support this local business, you will not regret it!!</review>

Mas Fuego has an amazing ambience. I love the trendy festive cantina vibe!

They have an vast selection of authentic flavorful mexican dishes such as carne asada street tacos, ceviche and their amazing mole. Their chips are also some of the best i've ever had.

Highly recommend this place and am excited to try more of their tasty dishes!</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) Adriana and Josue thank you for such kind treatment, I felt at home! They offered me the Quesabirrias that were not on the menu and frankly I liked them a lot (although they were more like barbecue quesadillas lol), the tres leches cake is a delight and in general the place is super nice. I recommend it 100%

This place is pretty good. They have paper towels and windsheild squeegees. Air and water as required. Bathroom key upon request. Cheaper than the neighboring gas stations. Employees are usually friendly when I ask them stuff. They have diesel.< /Text>

Nice little gas station. About $0.25 more than Costco if you have a members card. If not then it’s $0.35 more per gallon.
But you can wash your windshields here and the fluid is clear and not dirty water like some gas stations.</Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>Great prices but beyond that...I was getting the squeegee to wash some debris off my side mirror when I see the attendant (Alex) cleaning the pump handles with some windex and towl. I spoke with him about this, he cleans them once to twice a week!! That's awesome. The water is clean and soapy, inexpensive gas, friendly staff, and clean pump handles!! I've driven by here for years, new fill up spot for me. Clearly you and the owner care about your customers and station. Thanks again Alex and keep up the good work!</Review>< UserId.>

Today I had a really bad experience while trying to to air refill in the tires. The cashier is such an idiot that he kept switching the air machine off every few minutes. I had clearly told him that I need to fill air in all 4 tires

Ultimately i got frustrated and had to leave without doing it.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

These guys are great. If you want a perfect cappuccino - yes, this is your place.

It's a little pricy, yes, but you're paying for quality. And I get the feeling most of what you're paying for is the salary of the people who are frothing your milk. It's a great local place to support.<//Review>

<Review>Imagine you have a large group from out of town And you want to take them out for coffee, where do you take them? Starbucks? Hardly!

< review>
JUST OUR STYLE ! My wife found this cafe online and the reviews were pretty darn good so we hit it for breakfast before checking out of our hotel in Pismo Beach. We parked in front of the place about 8.30am and things were a bit quiet we could see. Of course in these strange times things are not always as they seem. We walked up to the service counter to be greeted by a very friendly man who happened to be the co-owner Gennero. We found out his talented wife & co-owner Laura bakes the delicious pastries. It is a very rustic building dotted with lots of quaint and colorful accents plus a huge timber deck patio shaded with umbrellas. We ordered a Creme Brûlée Latte ( Gennero suggested it to my wife ) while I was happy with a Hazelnut Latte ( both small sizes with 2 shots ) plus 2 x Breakfast Paninos ( Eggs, Italian Dry Salami, Mozzarella, Fresh Spinach & Roasted Red Bell Peppers on an Italian bread roll ). I collected our Lattes from the service counter when they were ready. A few minutes later our Breakfast sandwiches also were ready to retrieve. We relaxed on the ever so cute patio bordered by lots of lush greenery. Our well made creamy lattes tasted very good and the Breakfast Paninos were a healthy start to our day ! We thanked Gennero for our lovely breakfast and wished him all the best for the future !<//review>

This little coffee shop tucked away just off the highway in Arroyo Grande will surprise and delight.
The small coffee shop run by Gennaro and Laura has that small Italian coffee shop feel and matching coffee and treats to match.

The coffee is made with pride and one of my favorites is their americano. Try it without cream or sugar. Wow.

They also have a wide variety of treats and small bites. i have tried their breakfast sandwiches and left me full and happy.

They both always welcome you With a smile and warm hellos. You don’t want to miss this short jaunt off the highway for a little coffee and smiles.

Cheers and let me know how.l you liked it.</Text>

The shop setup is very odd, there isn't any inside seating and everything is generally worn down.

In terms of the coffee, the shots were pulled too hot and burned. I think there are a lot of powdered items (based on containers in the back) for blended drinks, but not certain as I didn't order one.

There are a lot of coffee shops in town, I wouldn't recommend this one.<//Text>

I love this place. They are so friendly. They also se be two types of coffee, beans toasted in Templeton and beans from Italy. The Italian coffee is the best! You can also get a real macchiato made here. They have almond and coconut milk for your beverages, too. There is a great selection of teas for non coffee drinkers. Lastly, they gave wonderful looking savory and sweet pastries as well as panini and salads. I haven’t tried the food yet but it looks great. This is my favorite coffee place for sure!<//Text>

Best coffee shop within 6,000 miles.  Honestly the taste and feel of the coffee is so amazing.  Pro tip: order from the Italian coffee menu on the side wall.  The espresso and cappuccino are to die for.  Best coffee I’ve had outside of Italy.  Don’t go to any other place to get coffee.  Not to mention the yummy cookies and food, and a really nice outdoor seating area.  Overall such a great vibe.  And the couple that own the place could not possibly be nicer.</text>

Best ambiance for a coffee shop. Cute outdoor seating. The coffee is amazing and tth pastry is out of this world. The best part is each coffee is paorep with a different pastry. Daily fresh baked cake. We got the blueberry, it is delicious
Biscotti is super filling and full of almond .
Take your friends and go , you will never regret it< /review>

Best Latte  on the Central Coast!!! Lovely Italian couple own it and everything is fresh baked! We will return!
And we have returned several times aweek... consistently excellent food, coffee, and lattes! Try the breakfast Pannini with eggs, spinach, a delicious salami, and yummy bread. Owners Laura and Gennaro are the nicest people. We love Perfetto Cafe!!< /Review>

<Review>One of the best beef noodle soups in the area! The beef is suuuuuper tender, the broth is rich and layered, and the noodle has perfect chewy texture.

Hubby had the salt and pepper chicken rice plate, and everything was delicious on there as well. They are not stingy with the meat or side vegetables at all! We got another meal's worth to go :D

Overall a great meal, will definitely return when we're in the area next.< /Review></record>

Their Taiwanese Beef Noodle is the best in the area! Both soup and beef are full of flavor. The goat hot pot is kind of plain in comparison. Goat meat is a bit too chewy for my taste, though the herb soup is quite nice. 5 stars if only noodle is rated. Will definitely try other dishes next time.<//Text>

I came at lunch time. But this place is not crowded at all.  I ordered a pork chop rice. I liked it although the pork chop was a bit too salty for me.  Big portion. Will go back again if I am around that area.</text>

<text>Not good. Taiwanese Cold noodles are really bad. Didn’t touch it after first bite. Beef in spicy beef noodles soup is not fresh. The soup flavor is not good. Salty spicy chicken is okay but they should cut them into smaller pieces. The only good thing I can say about this restaurant is their hot tea.  We won’t be coming back!< /text>< Pics>

Great to discover another restaurant DO NOT use MSG. I ordered minced pork noodle today. They separate the sauce and the noodle. You can decide the level of the sodium while you're eating. I usually like it with spicy sauce. From the noodle, sauce are authentic flavor to me.< /Review>

The beef noodle soup is really good. The noodles are hand made and the beef is very tender. Deserves higher praise. Make sure you choose thick noodle. Also it is debit or cash only.</Review>

<Review>This little hole in the wall reminded me of a local Tawainese joint we went to in Taipei and brought back fond memories of the bian dan (bento) boxes we used to grab for a quick lunch. We also liked the hot soy milk, which was served in a bowl. Be sure to ask for water or tea since service in English is basic. The atmosphere is underwhelming with its fluorescent lights and basic chairs/tables but the portions are generous, and the service is quick. You definitely come for the food and not the ambience. Super close to the Crippmas Place Christmas decorations!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOdHYHuUiftkG-f3LxKgC8a5tkDrnH-P3ojPJvE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808fbf98ad9c5be9:0x882acdcca7b382f0<//GmapID></record>

Food was ok, everything was served together, appetizer and entrees. By the time you finish your appetizer, your entree is cold . There was some sort of spicy pickle on a jar, full of fly when you open it. Not a clean restaurant.< /text>< Name>

The items on menu are reasonably priced. The dishes are a bit bigger than  places like this. I went few times for the beef noodle soups. It got few different portion of beef in it. The flavor was good. The parking space is a bit limited around the busy hours.< /text>

<Text>Food is super large portion and can hardly finished by single person.
Unfortunately the quality of that isn't worth taking the food home...
Noodles are so large portioned that the noodles got super soft and taste horrible.
Mediocre restaurant, but still worth visit...once awhile.<//Text>< user>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Their noodle soups, I especially beef noodle soups are probably the best things on the menu.  The meat is so tender and the broth is just phenomenal.  My dad, who is a Taiwanese native, really likes their food as it reminds him of what he ate in Taiwan.  Their appetizers are also very good.  However when it comes to their rice plates and dumplings...meh...I won't be getting them again.  Service there is just okay.  Nothing above and beyond.< /Text><response>None</response>< user>

Food was pretty good, good portions and service. Many dishes are heavily seasoned, so it's on the salty side. But hey, salt is actually good for you, so that's OK. Beef noodle soup is quite good, meat and tendons fall apart in your mouth and the flavors are deeply soaked in. Definitely one of the better Taiwanese restaurants in Newark. Would come again.<//review>

< Review>
Old Taro has the best paigu fan (pork chop and rice) I've had since living in Taiwan.  Very authentic and the owner is very friendly.  My wife (Taiwan native) has tried other dishes and she likes them a lot as well, but for me the paigu fan is the dish to go for.  We added this restaurant to our regular rotation.  Five stars for sure!<//Review>

A mom and pop shop serving your daily breakfast food like muffin egg sandwiches, donuts, and coffee.

I like the fact that all breakfast sandwiches are made to order and they taste delicious. They have 40 different combinations to try on, and also many varieties of donuts. They even insert the filling for their jelly donuts only when your order.

The shop is run by a couple and they're very friendly. I've noticed a trend that most patrons visiting the shop in the morning are regulars and know each other very well. You don't see too much of these kind of interactions these days.

A much better alternative if you're sick of the breakfast food they serve at junk food chains.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The lamb broth is very good! The salty crispy chicken is fried just right with thin skin, authentic Taiwanese cuisine! It is recommended that you bring your own pot to buy the lamb stove, and you can call to make a reservation instead of waiting in line!

(Original)
羊肉爐湯頭非常好！鹹酥雞薄皮炸得恰到好處，原汁原味的台灣料理！買羊肉爐建議帶自己的鍋子來裝，能先打電話預定比較不用排隊！</Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>(Translated by Google) From the perspective of Taiwanese, such a taste is not bad in foreign countries! Spicy beef tendon beef noodles, spicy, can add spicy, beef is sliced ​​burdock, full soft, tripe Not bad, but the tendon stew is soft and rotten.
There is only one type of noodles, which is a round noodle that is biased towards ramen.
The soup is not bad, the onion stuffing; the onion cake is quite delicious, one can eat on the spot, one takeaway

(Original)
以台灣人的角度來看，在國外這樣的口味算不錯了! 香辣牛肉牛筋牛肚麵，辣度一般，可以自己再加辣，牛肉是切片牛腱，滿軟嫩的，牛肚也不賴，但牛筋燉的偏軟爛.
麵條只有一種，偏向拉麵的圓形麵條.
餛飩湯還不錯，蔥肉餡；蔥燒餅蠻好吃的一份兩個，可以一個現場吃，一個外帶</text><user_id>105285293823940512817</user_id><Time>1550631735662</Time><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPD64kgUT5UtskhRKsRsw8qb2KNAjvlqiBZqF6b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7rN2S2M7KlFILoaL6BmvXN2nACwqs-ykC_OIW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8N1QvsWukB2MeW7fYrX-WafBDBMQ8MCNbUMA4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbSQ-8NqKl_hEghj7-o4xUr6YyQDhIaZXqGBHL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< username>

<text>(Translated by Google) The integrated side dishes are nice and have a spicy taste. Beef noodles and chicken ribs can also taste, the amount is very sufficient, the price is of course not cheap for me Taiwanese, but the price of the Bay Area is ordinary. Only cash, no toilet

(Original)
綜合小菜不錯，帶點辣味。牛肉麵跟雞排飯味道也可以，份量很足夠，價格對於我這台灣人來說當然是不便宜，但以灣區的物價來說是普通。只收現金，沒有廁所</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfvG6dnBLowhGbKjQGr-Nfzcs8jCxxDTt9vGVN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6z_LQjGWdGwmt1Tl33aTSnCH3bzp0sr8dBYfd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMi8oDvKjnrQqCRaPL5Ha5XIDyDNMVS3eXCjHH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvtI1Nf7BOrithhWAugmxkHuII2RcJGMfkewus=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2B7ypW50ABB68dx1hWQZTeuDPw0X7OBATa684=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

<Review>Since 1956, The Bakersfield Museum of Art has been showcasing fine art and is said to be one of the city’s top attractions.

Inside this large museum are two large galleries and two smaller ones. The permanent collection features art by local artists. The rest of the rotating exhibits feature a mix of art from all over.

The outside grounds of the museum are home to some beautiful gardens and sculptures.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgP5P-DGvzm4taN_zfAWd6dVUvlsbJWn27Js17=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><user_name>Ankit Patel< /user_name>< userid>

The exhibits are great and educational for kids. We went to the rainforest and to the gem and skin exhibits which were a great learning experience. I honestly was impressed the most by the beautiful butterflies.<//review>

This place is awesome for learning and visiting, it gets crowded and has long lines, they have very cool animals and explanations and shows. i highly recommend it.<//Review>

I love this place but was disappointed the Rain Forest exhibit was closed. My favorite part was simulated flying like a pterosaur - the new name for pterodactyls. Lots of fun. Scientists have learned a lot about them since I went to school. Also enjoyed displays about evolution of the earth's crust and the beautiful gift shop. Prices in the cafe are a bit expensive tho. Still worth a visit!< /Text>

Visited with my daughter and her fiancé as a possible venue for their wedding. The museum is beautiful; the grounds were also very beautiful, very green and well maintained overall. But the gazebo needs a little bit of a refurbishing and paint, and apparently there was a mishap with a prior landscaper where some bushes and vines were affected. But they are coming back nicely. Would have been a great wedding venue, only the time frame was off for us.<//Text>

<Text>No problem  with the museum's
HOWEVER
I Purchased a family   membership and was told I could bring my 5 list grandchildren who where written on the card by the worker who sold the membership  to me.
When I brought my  5 grandchildren to the Laurie Brock museum  on 8-1-18 I was told only 2 of them were allowed at one time....
Fraud
The reason I purchased the membership  was so I could have time with all of the cousins together.  I asked about it at time of purchase and was told, no problem, just show the card.  Lies...
Very disappointing.
8-1-18
Just asked to speak with a supervisor
I was informed that 2 adults and 6 children  are  allowed and the girl at admissions  made a mistake.</Text>< Rating>

<Text>Has a nice collection of art. Didn't get to go into the garden but the inside had a large collection. They usually have a monthly special which is nice. Small entrance fee making it even more reason to go.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>I'll be very honest,I love the artwork but I don't ever want to go back there to visit due to an employee,Juana Martinez,who continuously takes photos of me without permission and doesn't care whether you like it or not . She seems to  be more on her personal cell phone taking sneaky pictures of people than doing her job .I don't mean to talk down about her ,only her actions and that is why I can't go there to support the museum.</review><user_name>Rick Rowland< /user_name>< UserId.>

We went to The Bakersfield Museum Of Art and spent about an hour looking at the paintings and sculptures on display. They had a couple of special exhibits and some permanent ones as well.< /Review>

We have been going to Rogers for the last 15 years.  We have made several purchases from them and will only buy from Rogers.  Sandy manages a staff of kind, helpful and friendly folks who help, not push sales like greasy used car salesmen.  Jose helped us on our last sale.  We arrived near closing time and he was patient and helpful in finding my wife the perfect birthday Gift.  Thank you guys!< /text>

<text>If you're looking for the perfect gift, get to Rogers. They have all kinds of jewelry from watches to designer brands and an amazing custom jewelry designer that literally designs your one-of-a-kind piece in front of you. They don't do sales but several times a year they  hold store events where they bring in extra inventory and raw diamonds that you can shop and create unique artisan pieces  you'll hand down or generations!< /text><gmap_id>0x80905039de5b742b:0xddf24217541b0308< /gmap_id><userid>112329522864548391409</userid><date>1562724285417</date>< Rate>

I had the best experience with Rogers communicating with me. It only took a few minutes to an hour or less to get back to me with answers to my questions. Very helpful. Great products. We bought our wedding rings their almost 39 years ago and haven’t for gotten the great service they had back then. Of course they were the first jewelry store to come to mind when purchasing another ring for my husband since he lost his. Guarantee that you will never find better service or products than you will with Rogers. Thank you for everything. He loves his ring.</text>

<Text>Happy wife  equals happy life. After 16 years of marriage my husband and I decide to shop for a much needed upgrade. Store manager Sandee Curiel  was adorable and full of personality plus. She was attentive , entertaining  and knowledgeable. She is a huge asset to Rogers Jewelry Co. Even with these foreseen times, her along with her staff reassured our safety and went above and beyond to find us exactly what we were looking for.  Thank you Rogers Jewelry Co. for taking such great care of us. We will definitely be back.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80905039de5b742b:0xddf24217541b0308< /Gmap_id>< Resp>

< Review>
I used Rogers Jewelers in Modesto Calif recently when I lost my diamond tennis bracelet and my Insurance authorized replacement.  I live in Wyoming and was told i could use any jewelry store i wanted.  We used Rogers 23 years earlier when my husband bought my wedding set and over the years a few more times. So i gave them a call explained what happened and they were happy to help me replace my piece.  Sandy helped me pick something out and about 3 weeks later it arrived at my home in Wyoming. I love my new rings.  If your in need Rogers Jewelers is the place.   Great service , quality , friendly and helpful.<//Review>

I had a broken pearl necklace that belonged to my mother (its over 70 years old). I am familiar with Rogers Jewelry integrity and stopped by to see if they thought they could fix it. Todd was professional, friendly and understood my position immediately. After a few weeks, the necklace was returned in beautiful condition. Todd was kind enough to  check in with me in the interim to let me know how the repair was going. You can be comfortably assured that you are in good hands with Rogers Jewelry.< /review>

<Review>I have been a Rogers Jewelry fan for years. My favorite sales person is Sandee. She always gives me good advise when I am selecting something. When I wanted to put all my gold charms on a bracelet, she designed it and picked out the best bracelet for them. She is very knowledgeable, pleasant, and helpful. I always enjoy “shopping” with her.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

My wife and I have been purchasing jewelry from Roger’s Jewelry for 20+ years.  Their Store Manager, Sandee Curiel, has become a life long friend that we really consider “family”!!  Roger’s sales staff and office personnel have become very special friends as well.  Their jewelry quality is of the utmost caliber.  My wife has had many pieces designed for her by Roger’s designer, David. I too have been blessed to have some pieces of my own designed by David.  His attention to detail and unique design concepts helps set Roger’s apart from the “franchise” jewelers! It is very much a family operation.  I hIghly recommend Roger’s Jewelry for all your jewelry needs!< /Text>

The manager Sandy was so helpful in retrieving needed information from the other store that I have to say, if you are in there area she will definitely go out of her way to take care of you. She could have just given me the number or transferred me to that store which would have been appropriate, but she went the extra mile and did the leg work for me. Awesome job!<//Review>< Pics>

Prior to buying my fiancé’s engagement ring I had absolutely no knowledge on jewelry. The moment I walked into Rogers JOSE treated me like family rather than a customer! Walked me through the various types of styles and diamonds while being completely patient with my hundred questions. The entire process was smooth as the rest of the staff was friendly and helpful. I will be returning to purchase my fiancé’s wedding band with Jose in the near future. Thank you again for the help Jose!!</review>

<Text>I currently purchased a ring at Rogers Jewelers and I am very satisfied. Todd Evans was attentive to every detail and followed up with me over the course of my search until I found exactly what I was looking for. I will forever be thankful for his customer service and highly recommend him and Rogers Jewelers to all my friends and family.< /Text>< gmap_id>

I called this location instead of the Folsom store by accident. The manager Sandy was so helpful in retrieving needed information from the other store that I have to say, if you are in there area she will definitely go out of her way to take care of you. She could have just given me the number or transferred me to that store which would have been appropriate, but she went the extra mile and did the leg work for me. Awesome job!<//Review>

I’ve been coming here for multiple years. Hands down Rodgers has the biggest selection with the most beautiful Diamonds. Todd Evans Is my go to guy, he is honest and knows his stuff. He will work very hard to make sure you find what you are looking for! When I come to Rodgers I don’t feel like just another customer. I will continue to do my business and recommend you do too. Thank you again for the great service!!

My husband and I got a custom wedding band made for myself and purchased his wedding band here which both were completely breathtaking. With the help from Todd he made out experience here at Rogers just fantastic! He showed us professionalism, compassion, and he was over all a pleasure to talk too. My husband and I are extremely happy with our business at Rodgers and will definitely be  going back. :)<//text>

I've been buying high end watches for years, I noticed Tag Heuer had a Limited Edition that was just released. I call Todd at Rogers, he was very knowledgeable and invited me to the Modesto store. Todd is great at what he does, he sold me three watches and a pair of Hearts on Fire earrings for my wife in the past year. Todd is my go-to guy for jewelry. Five Stars all the way Todd< /text>

Todd was sensational. I had been shopping around looking at rings for what seemed like an eternity. I had thought about custom but feared it would be far outside my budget but Todd worked with me to make sure I was not just happy with the end product but that I didn’t feel like I was throwing everything I had at it. I am so in love with how the ring turned out but the process wouldn’t have been so enjoyable if it wasn’t for Todd. He answered all of my questions quickly and with detail which eased my mind for when they began to cast the ring.
Thank you so much Todd for being absolutely amazing!<//Text>

Growing up I recall my grandparents and uncle would speak fondly of Rogers Jewelry.  It was their experience that prompted me to stop by Rogers Jewelry of Modesto.  We were assisted by Todd Evans, who provided attentive service and patience, which resulted in a wonderful shopping experience.  Interaction with all consultants and support staff was also very pleasant.  A recent follow-up visit pertaining to an adjustment to one of the purchased items, and not a new sale, reinforced the positive experience.  The staff I made contact with, as well as Todd, treated me kindly, and as a guest, not as a nuisance.  The whole experience was reminiscent of what customer service was like in past and what it should be like today.

Thank you again Todd and all of Rogers Jewelry!

Sincerely,

Ben< /review>

<Text>I came into Rogers Jewelers in Modesto on October 12, 2019 with an idea of what I was looking for.  Wanting to pick the perfect ring, I was feeling soo overwhelmed.  Todd and Sandee were both very patient, knowledgeable, and went out of their way to help me put together exactly what I was looking for.  My fiancé absolutely loves her Fire and Ice diamond ring!  Thank you both for your part in our happily ever after! ❤️❤️❤️<//Text></record>

Went shopping for an engagement ring and found one she liked and one she loved. We went with the one she liked to save some money. After paying for the ring I decided to see if I could upgrade to the ring she loved. Sandee was incredibly helpful in helping me with the upgrade and was also super covert so my GF wouldn't find out!
In short, I will definitely be doing business there in the future. A well earned A+</review>

Really great store, with surprisingly helpful staff. I needed a specific size ring on extremely short notice, due to my own tardiness, and they went above and beyond getting it there and ready with time to spare. Todd was really great and took the time to help my wife and I, and I appreciate the fact that he never tried to push an upsell or steer us away from what we were looking for. He checked up on us after the fact and made sure the ring was being delivered even though he wasn't even working the store that day.< /review>

Very positive experience in my search for a new ring (47th anniversary).  Todd Evans is the person who showed me rings & explained the diamond clarity, etc.  My husband wanted me to shop for the band that I wanted, and I did find one which I really liked and purchased.  It had to be sized and was ready the next day. Todd and the staff I encountered made this experience one that I will gladly share with others.< /Text>

My fiancé and i worked with Sandee, the Modesto manager, for over a year before finally deciding on what we wanted. She is extremely knowledgeable! She let us try on SO many rings, on many different occasions. We have since been back multiple times and will only purchase jewelry from Rogers! Sandee also had my ring soldered together and back to me, the next day! If you’re looking for top quality jewelry, i would recommend seeing Sandee, at Rogers!<//Text>

<Review>My family has been coming here for the better part of 25 years and Roger's is the only jeweler in town we will go to. Have made multiple purchases both outright and on credit with no fuss and with a great variety/selection. The facility is nice, clean, and the staff is very knowledgeable, friendly, and personable. My only complaint was the last time we came in, Deborah was overly pushy in trying to sell us a piece far out of our price range. When I asked her to please stop and that we were not interested, she became even more pushy on selling and tried getting us to "just put it on credit". A little disappointing, but perhaps we will solely work with someone else in the future. Still a great store with nice pieces. We will be back.</Review><Response>None< /Response><name>Jeremy Epps< /name><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmapID>

I went on to look for an engagement ring and it was a success. They were super friendly and helpful. Todd helped me and his customer service was excellent and I definitely would recommend Rodgers jewelry to everyone I know for their great selection of jewelry and rings.<//text>

We love Rogers Jewelry!  Our salesman Todd is amazing and very patient.  We started our journey with Roger's in Sept 2018.  We went in to have a battery replaced in my watch and ended up with a beautiful Two Hearts Collection diamond engagement ring to replace my wedding ring.  In October, Todd helped us add to the ring.  He helped us pair two beautiful diamond bands with the engagement ring to complete the set.  It's such a special piece now complete with an engagement ring, wedding band and anniversary band.  Its stunning!

Fast forward to yesterday March 16th.  Todd invited us to a special event happening at the store.  March is my birthday month and I had been eyeing an aquamarine ring.  The special event was insane.  One of the biggest collections of jewelry I have ever seen in one place.  Fantastic pricing too.  A bit overwhelming.  I ultimately decided that I still really wanted the aquamarine ring and diamond Todd has showed us previously.  He gave us the friends and family pricing and it was a GREAT deal.

The customer is great.  The entire store runs well.  From sales to finance everyone seems to be working together.   I pop in when I am in the area and they clean my rings and check them over without hesitation.

I can't see buying jewelry anywhere else.  Roger's is quality backed by years of doing buisness in Modesto.  It's not a mall store that may not be around a year after you purchase.

Happy shopping!<//text>

<Text>My girl and I had a great experience at Rogers while buying our wedding rings. We went in there with what I’d personally consider a relatively small budget and the sales guy we were working with, Todd, didn’t try to upsell us at all or push us to just finance something more expensive etc. He also didn’t ever rush us or make us feel like he was missing out on bigger sales or anything like that. I’d definitely recommend this store and I’m glad we didn’t go to one of the big chains like Kay or Jared or whatever. We’ll be back for sure< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80905039de5b742b:0xddf24217541b0308</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I bought a ring from Rogers jewelry from Sandee Curiel. She helped me through the whole process and made it very easy. I would highly recommend Sandee for all of your ring and necklace needs. I have been going to Rogers for the last 30 years and I have never been disappointed with service or product.< /review>

<Review>Todd is amazing!! My fiancé and I before getting engaged decided to go check out some stores to get an idea of what I like in rings. The first store that we stopped at was Rogers.  As we walked in we were greeted by Todd.  He was very personable and answered every single one of our questions.  He was very helpful and knowledgeable.  We went to two more stores after that and felt like they were lacking especially after the wonderful service we got from Todd.  Needless to say we got my engagement ring from Rogers and went back to get our wedding bands from there too  Todd has helped us with it all. He helped make something that could be stressful into a joyful experience that we will never forget. We are very appreciative and highly encourage people to go there. You won't be disappointed at how they treat you like family.</Review>< pictures>

My wife and I had a wonderful experience at the Modesto Rogers Jewelry store. My wife’s plan was to have her wedding ring refreshed,  my thoughts were to surprise her with a 40th Anniversary “upgrade”. We were very fortunate to have “Sandee” as our hostess. We being customers of Rogers Jewelry for 40 years from the Stockton Store , it was fun to hear that Sandee had apprenticed there also, what a coincidence. With her knowledge, experience, thoughtfulness and compassion, we all settled on the perfect “surprise!” Also, any thoughts of enhancement in the future were mentioned which made me very happy. A wonderful experience for my wife and I, as it should be, with thanks to Sandee and Rogers Jewelry
Thank You

Outstanding service from Todd!  I came in to check my ring and the diamond needed to be tightened!  It was going to be ready in 2 days I live in Lodi so not that  convenient to just come back!  Todd offered to drop it off at my house!  That's what I call awesome service!  Thank you Todd!</Text>

Sandee helped my husband pull of the most amazing surprise for our 15th Anniversary, It will be an Anniversary we will definitely not forget! The staff at Rogers definitely went above and beyond their job on this one. We have done business with Rogers from the start of our marriage and will always continue to bring all our business back to them. We never have any complaints! Thank you Rogers staff and Sandee for all the help!< /Review>

5 star service from the Assistant Manager himself!

I had my eyes glued to this Special Edition Tag Heuer Carrera Calibre and wanted it badly as a birthday present to myself. I usually buy my stuff online, but for security reasons, I
hesitated at that time because it was a major purchase.

Unfortunately, even major Department stores and most Authorized Dealers don't carry it which made me want it even more!

After spending countless hours on the internet and days of calling nearby jewelry stores within the Bay area and the Valley, I gave up! None of them will carry the item.

But because I knew I deserve to have one, I resumed and constantly browsed the Tag website in search for an authorized dealer store who can help me, and found Roger's Jewelry Co in Modesto California. It was Todd Evans who answered my phone call who actually wanted the same watch for himself and was very knowledgeable about the product. I went to their store the following morning and he walked me through the buying process, since it's a special edition item, he had to order directly from the manufacturer in Switzerland! I waited at least 4-5 weeks since my watch was still "in production" and tell me about it - It was the longest 5 weeks of my life to say the least! You know that feeling when you know you have a gift under the tree but won't be able to open it until Christmas morning? Todd kept me posted regularly until I received the good news - my watch was ready for pick up! I got it just in time for my birthday! Woohoo😎

Thanks to Todd for a top-notch customer service! Extremely personal and pleasant yet very professional in dealing with his customers! On top of that, he even gave me a great deal for my birthday as well without me even asking!

I would definitely go back and buy again from him! Highly recommended!</text>

The first mistake, no one greeted me like all the other jewelry places I went to did. Secondly, I didn't get asked for help. I  literally walked around the engagement set counter like a ghost. A couple of minutes later a women asked if I had been helped with an attitude. At this point I decided to just walk out.

For it being my first time at Roger jewelry in Modesto, I was very unhappy. I will never go back there.<//text><date>1437522436885<//date>< user_id>

Today, I called Rogers Jewelry needing information on a diamond pendant that I had lost. Sandy was so helpful. She looked up the information on our account and found the item in archives. She did explain that she may not be able to get more information but she would try. Not even a half hour later she had all the information and emailed it to me so I could give it to my insurance company. Thank you so much Sandy.

I feel I need to give a little family history of our relationship with Rogers. My parents bought their wedding sets at Rogers in 1945 and my mom got a new wedding band much later on. My parents bought my 8th grade graduation present, my birthstone ring, from Rogers in 1962 and my high school graduation present, a beautiful watch that I still wear, in 1969. My husband bought my wedding rings at Rogers in 1970. All of these transactions were at the Modesto Rogers Jewelry Store. Of course the locations have changed over the years, their quality and custmer service have always been the best.

We no longer live in California, but always come back to Rogers for our jewelry needs.

Thank you, Rogers Jewelers for always being the best.

<date>1519849354894< /date><rating>5</rating><Review>Honestly I’m speechless.  Sandee rocks.  She has an amazing eye.  I showed my husband a picture of a ring set with extra band I found online that I just LOVED, he showed Sandee that ring set and she was able to create the exact look I was wanting.  The extra band that she found was perfect and just made my ring  pop even more.  She worked with my husband to help him pick out the perfect diamond and after 20 years of marriage my husband got on his knee and asked me to marry him again and gave me this amazing gift.  I still feel like I am dreaming because it’s exactly what I wanted but never thought it could be possible.  Hands down a wonderful experience for my husband and I.  We will forever do business at Rogers and I will be sure to tell anybody and everybody I know that needs a piece to go see Sandee!  Thanks again Sandee!  It’s perfect and I’m totally in love!<//Review>< Pics>

Up scale, overpriced,no resale value the second you buy anything there it loses any value and if taken back to them its only bought for melt value for the gold and diamonds arnt worth squat unless there being sold by them to you till you bought and paid in full then there overpriced trash that you'll never get 10 % of price you paid if your lucky  if you go to resale them to the ones you bought them off of .<//Review>

<Review>My husband and I had a wonderful experience at Rogers.  Especially meeting our new jeweler Matt there was an amazing experience. We didn't feel rushed nor feel pressured into buying anything. I felt like we have kown Matt forever.  Rogers resized my husband ring and it looks fabulous. I also upgraded my diamond and came home with my new diamond in my wedding ring on the same day.  I was and still am in awwww. My ring is gorgeous!   I highly recommend Rogers Jewelry.   Thank you Matt & Rogers Jewlery!< /Review><resp>None< /resp>< Rating>

I started going to Rogers jewlers when I was 19 years old, they help me start my credit history. Back the Rogers was located in the Modesto mall. Sandy has sold me 4 watches, two sets of  Diamond ear rings, and a wedding ring set over the last 15 years.
I had my wife's wedding ring made at Rogers jewlers. With guidance from Sandy, I picked out the fire&ice princess cut center stone with a custom band. My wife is in love with her ring and it is the ring of her dreams. when it was time for the wedding band, sandy help me custom make it. Everywhere my wife goes she get complements, and I didn't spend a huge amount of money. To this day I have only seen a couple ring sets as nice as my wife's. Rogers jewlers is the few places I've spend my hard earned money and never regretted it.
Sandy has watch me grown from a young teenager to a husband and father. I have 6 close friends who all buy from Rogers Jewlers and they all go to Sandy. She makes us feel special, and I do consider her a friend now. There isn't many people in any type of sales that can make you feel like she does. Rogers jewlers and Sandy will always have my business!<//review>

Top notch service. Sandee was awesome; she really got what I was looking for, although I wasn't even so sure myself at first! I found the perfect wedding set and couldn't be happier. Lots of compliments on my gorgeous ring. I had considered purchasing a ring on the internet...if this is you, STOP! You really need a consultant to help, recommend, assist, and you need to try them on! Wear it, walk around with it, look in the mirror...all things Sandee had me do, and wow, did it make a difference. Thank you, Rogers Jewelry and Sandee, for providing me with excellent service.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Taco truck without the truck. I seriously search for trucks only if I can, as I have the most authentic food at trucks typically. I believe this used to be a truck called ESTEBAN, if so, or not, they have not lost their connection to quality authentic food. Their al pastor is the best I have had this far north in California.</review>< pictures>

This place is a hot contender for my favorite burrito. The super chicken, and super al pastor are our go-to's, and they never disappoint. The homemade tortillas are bomb, and Esteban has got to be the fastest burrito roller in town.</Text>

<text>I went out of my way to write this review while eating my reet to say this. Every other burrito in Humboldt county tastes like a sock full of undercooked rice and rubber  bands for meat when compared to the symphony of Estebans burritos. They also  make their own tortillas which should tell you enough. The only quarrel I have with Estebans, wack hours but I understand I guess.< /text><response>None</response>< user>

Amazing food!!! I go hear everytime Im in Arcata. They make their own tortillas. Always fast service and Esteban is very nice. It is very reasonable pricing for what you get. I have always gotten a 5 star experience when I go, which is often. You won't be disappointed!!!!<//review>

<review>I came here before and they were alright but now it’s a very lazy and nonchalant environment the customer service is terrible and the haircuts are even worse. I came in for a fade and was left with a small patch on one side and when a trim is all I want i still had to pay the full $25. I waited for about 30 minutes and the barber who was done left to the liquor store and ignored me completely I honestly didn’t even feel like paying them for how bad the experience was. If u value your money and time I don’t recommend coming here they are unprofessional and low quality with high pricing, the barber next to stater brothers near APU is ur best bet if ur in the Azusa area.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>
{'time': 1619105980118, 'text': "So you came for a fade ? But your complaining about paying full price for a trim ? Doesn't make sense 😕  We don't charge by the amount of hair we cut. Sorry to loose you I am sure you'll be fine by the Barbershop offer by stater bros .  Thanks for  giving us a try."}</response>

<Response>None</Response><text>Been going there forever.  All the barbers there are easy to talk to extremely friendly and professional.  They give you exactly what you ask for.  Walk in looking like a mess walk out feeling like a million bucks.  This shop definitely had it down right.</text>< pics>

<review>A nice old school barber shop with very well trained barbers.
I get my haircut from Al himself, a nice and talkative guy, who talks just the right amount.
Al is a Raiders and a Dodgers fan.
I am always satisfied by me haircut at Big Al's Barber shop</review><Gmap_id>0x80c327c5627773e7:0x7ee7e6702f1e6037<//Gmap_id><rate>5<//rate><Response>None< /Response><pictures>None</pictures><Name>Leif Arildsen< /Name></record>

<Review>This is the worst barbershop I have ever been. The man who did my hair cut didn’t have a single ounce of idea about how to proceed. So he kept asking a lot of questions there regard and even asked how many inches I would want. Come on, man!  Hair cutting is sort of art rather than science.  Moreover, he even became angry and impolite and started arguing with me...<//Review></record>

Came for a haircut solo. me and another guy have been waiting for 30+ min and straight up got skipped just because a lady walked in with her son saying she had somewhere to go and if they can cut his sons hair. Terrible first come first serve.<//Text>

My son gets his hair cut here and they always do a great job. He went yesterday and got his hair done by a young guy with glasses and he did an amazing job. My son can be fidgety but you can't tell by looking at his fresh cut! Definitely coming back soon!</Text>

<text>Excellent service! This barber shop is high quality without the high price tag. I like that I gave minimal directions and yet I loved the haircut. They vacuum your head for those annoying little hairs!! Never had that done to me before and it saves you from getting hairs everywhere. The neck massage before the shave was nice too.</text>< Pictures>

I frequent this shop since it was located in the same parking lot as the Big Square market in Pacific Ave and when it used to be HK Market. Since 1998, it went through at least three different barbers. Even through different barbers, the shop provided and continues to provide consistently good men's haircut.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>{'time': 1605962284075, 'text': 'Thank you!'}</resp>< GmapID>

<text>He’s a great barber with very affordable prices. I have thick Asian hair and I have to say he knows how to cut it quickly, efficiently, but with a good eye for detail. The fact that he is able to do a fade with scissors is great as well as many barbers don’t know how to do this, and it definitely leaves a more natural look in the hair as it grows out. Prices are very affordable as well for $15 for a basic haircut, and $17 for haircut plus shampoo as of June 2018. I’m not sure if he does more extravagant styles you may find at fancy salons and $40+ barbershops, but if you want a no-frills, neat, well done classic haircuts, this is a great shop to visit.

Side note: he doesn’t speak English all too well, but as long as you are patient, and bring in a picture to give an idea of what you want, you’ll be in good hands.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< date>

I'm extremely happy with my choice to come here! This guy's ability to shape and fade with scissors is impressive. They also clean up neck/sideburns with a razor which makes for an altogether exceptional cut @ $15.<//review>

<Text>Went in early on Sunday because they were open which was nice since Most barbers are closed on Sunday.   On to the haircut, the barber is precise with scissors and then uses the trimmer to complete a mens fade. They also vacum your hair clean. I paid the extra 2 bucks for the shampoo. They also clean your ears with a q-tip and give you a quick massage and you're good to go.  I would definitely come back. 5 stars!!< /Text>< pictures>

Explained what I want, showed the photo and got the worst haircut in 2 years. They don't accept card, barely speak English and they quickly finished me up as soon as the other client showed up.< /Review>

My hair was cut unevenly and they left a large patch on the back of my neck undone so it looked like I had a weird path of hair.</Text>

(Translated by Google) The barber recommended a hairstyle suitable for the customer, so I tried it, and the satisfaction was high.

Worst customer service ever! Do not recommend!! Worst part was I told them i don’t how they painted my nails or how they didn’t even clean my feet they just massage your LEGS for the most part not even your FEET. They charged me 20 dollars  more than what they said it should cost.
Kept continuing to charge me and not listen to me.<//text>

Paid 38 bucks for 2 color acylics. Decent pricing but the lady cut some of my fingers with the drill. Other then that its better than most salons in the area.<//Review>

I stopped going here about a year ago. I forgot to write my experience. First incident, I sat down to get my nails done believing it was one price. But by the end the lady doing my nails told me, "no, because your nails are longer the price is more." I had only brought enough for my nails and a tip but since the price increased I only had enough for the service. I couldn't give her a tip. She snatched my money in annoyance and made a sound like, "Psft" with her mouth as though she was annoyed. I just let it blow over. The next time my mom and I went in we had been sitting there waiting. Another lady and her boyfriend walked in after us. They did not schedule an appoitment and I know this because they said, "we just want a manicure and pedicure. Weve never been here before. How long is the wait." Etc. It was obvious they did not set up an appointment. But she remembered that I didnt tip the last time and she welcomed them with open arms to come sit down and she told me and my mom, they had appointment. The girl and her boyfriend looked confused because they knew she was lying. I HOPE it was because the tip thing and not because they're racist... most horrible service ever. They are very rude unless you tip good EVERY TIME.<//text>

<Review>AWEFUL AWEFUL AWEFUL customer service!!! I took my daughter to this shop to get a full set. My daughter is in a wheelchair. She was born with a condition called AMC that causes her hands to be twisted, fingers don't bend & she has tight joints. They took one look at her, asked if her hands could go straight then immediately without trying said no! They are very rude! We will NEVER step foot in there again! I took my daughter to Pretty Nails & they did not only did an amazing job but they are very friendly & have a very welcoming environment!< /Review>< pictures>

Went in here for the first time and was recieved immediately. I asked for a simple acrylic nail set which looked great. Unfortunately the lady that did my nails cut into the nail fold area(where nail ends into skin) so bad I had pain for the next few days. Wont be comming back.<//text>

<Text>I normally do not post a response if it is not positive but my experience here was so terrible that I feel I have to. When I entered the shop it was busy but she assured me the wait would be only 20 minutes and I waited 40 which wouldn't have been bad had my nails come out nicely but they did not. I showed her the design I wanted and asked her if she could do it and she said she could. She painted one fingernail and I realized she could not so I asked her for something simpler. She became angry and did a poor job removing the gel. When she finished it was sloppy and there was gel crammed under my nails. When I pointed it out to her she took the sharp end of a file and crammed it under my nails to dislodge the gel. Overall, it was a painful and unsatisfying experience. I work hard for my money so I don't like to just waste it which is what I did by going to that shop. Worst $30 I've ever spent. If I could give it no stars, I would. I won't be going back there and neither should anyone else. Awful.< /Text><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

I'm very disappointed in a customer service and the nail quality is absolutely horrible all of my nails are lifting they are uneven they look absolutely disgusting this is only after a week I will be returning I also wouldn't miss them yelling at another woman ganging up on her about the prices of nails was completely uncalled for</text>

<text>My nails were horrible  . All of them were different shapes and when I went back to ask for a refund I was told that they couldn’t give me a refund because they had done nothing wrong . I payed 40$ for acrylic and shellac. The lady cut me with the drill as well. Over priced and they came out so bad. If you want good nails go to polished nail and spa on mchenry not here.

<review>Horrible Place always dirty they don't clean the tub from the pedicure chairs they use used items on customers! Did my nails and feet and they only cut my hands and feet I'm literally bleeding. Very unhappy 1-26-17 at 430pm. They are Very rude and will not fix any mistakes they make . one of the workers kept on trying to convince me to spend more money.  She did a horrible job and i asked her nicely to re paint my nails and she  said no! And started yelling in my face!! Thats no way to treat a paying customer!  and they are racist btw. I didnt want to pay her a dime but i paid her anyways because i am kind hearted.

If you need food fast, this is the place to go. Nevermind quality because they don't have any consistency. Some days their beans are burned others their taco shells are stale, there is never a time that everything is fresh and crisp. Fries are usually undercooked as well. Best option is their del Tacos...when they put enough cheese on them. 🤔<//text>

I receive excellent service today at this Del Taco from Dinette.
This Del taco is above average, the staff was friendly the dining room is clean and a lot of people seem to use it.
The food was fresh and as ordered.
Clearly a Del Taco doesn't compete with a steakhouse... But comparing this location to other Del Tacos, and other fast food options, they definitely stood out as clean, polite, and efficient.</text>

Ordered. Paid. Asked to wait up front. After 10 minutes, they bring the food. Didn’t seem fresh at all and a burrito was missing. Not the best but decent.<//text>

Fast service.  I ordered 2 tacos and 1 burrito. Both taco shells were cracked.  Burrito tortilla could have been fresher. Not much sauce on the burrito.< /text>

Best Del Taco I've been to in awhile. And I've sadly been to many. One employee who stood out the most to me was Breanna. She definitely knows how to be personable, friendly, and make you feel like you're not just another car, even at 1am! Definitely made my horrible night a lot better just from her customer service.

Thank you! I'll be back< /text>

<review>It's your typical fast food. Restaurant was clean and food was delivered fast and hot. Staff was curteous and didn't hate that they were there. Ordered the chicken soft tacos and never let's me down. Food was fast which is why we stopped here. Employees were friendly and polite. Food was good. Impressive Bathroom was really clean.  Burrito was really big. Del Taco on Frederick in Moreno Valley is an enjoyable place to grab a quick Mexican meal at a reasonable price. The manager Irene keeps a great group of employees who always care about their customers. While I lived in town, I used to get my lunches there 3-4 times a week, always being able to stay in my budget. I am very thankful for the pride Irene displays in her store, and that is why I come to her store.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

An AWESOME place to go for a family Breakfast. The environment and the employees are so sweet and family Oriented. We go there because of the Manager Bree, she is so sweet and our grand daughter lives to see her and gives her big hugs. It's more of a family Oriented place, where everyone knows everyone. If you haven't gone to Del Taco on Moreno Beach St. Then you need to go. Great food, and great people's and great employees. Go and ask for Bree, AWESOMENESS!!</review>

Very very disappointed in the food.  I asked when I ordered for HOT fries and we got cold and old grease taste.  And my red burrito, I asked for extra red sauce, extra cheese and add sour cream.  So NO sauce at all, i small dot of sour cream and absolutely no extra cheese. Then we were ready to go and needed a small bag and my daughter stood at the counter and 3 employees just kept walking passed her and never asked if she needed something for about 5 minutes.  What happened to customer service.  I worked at a Del Taco and it was all about the customers and the freshness of the food that would keep coming back.  So sad!!< /Review>

<Text>Del Taco on Frederick in Moreno Valley is an enjoyable place to grab a quick Mexican meal at a reasonable price. The manager Irene keeps a great group of employees who always care about their customers. While I lived in town, I used to get my lunches there 3-4 times a week, always being able to stay in my budget. I am very thankful for the pride Irene displays in her store, and that is why I come to her store. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK IRENE!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

What really makes them especially good in our small town is it they're open all night. There's only a few places to go if you've got the late night munchies Del Tacos a good one.</Review>< user>

Great customer service!
Edit: Normally Deltaco has not disappointed, but tonight they did. I ordered two separate meals, one order was done correctly, but the second order of Del Carbon Tacos were awful. Each taco shell was completely torn in half with all the meat falling out, the shells were stale, like they were microwaved too long. The chicken taste awful. I don't know who made them, but they should be ashamed of themselves. I will call them tomorrow and let them know about this, I want my money back. Customer service is still fantastic.< /Text>

< review>
Wow, they have really gone down hill. The 1/2 pound bean and cheese burritos the last 10 times we have gone have weighed at 5.25 oz through 7.02. Two days ago I felt no weight after getting my bag. The burritos were so small I sent them back. We had been waiting for ever in the drive thru. They took forever and I drove through. I asked my son the check them. They were so small again. Felt way below the 5.25oz. So I parked and went in. No manager!! I let them know there was no excuse and to bring out their scale. They didn't. They remade them. I got home and weighted them as 7.75oz and 8.1 oz. So at least normal range. It really bothers me because they keep getting smaller when a half pound is a half pound, and the price has gone from .99 to $1.19!!!!</review>

<text>The sad thing is I love Del Taco. But this store is the worst!! The girl that help at the register was good. But the manager was making the food. We got 2 chicken sneakers 1 had a good amount of chicken the 2nd one had like 3 small pieces. Did he think we wouldn't notice.<//text>< Name>

That's what I expect from a chain fast food restaurant consistency. Today the drive-in employee forgot about me and left me out there for a minute or two. Accidents happen! That's for sure, but it's the attention to details and the customer service experience that makes a difference. I've been to this restaurant before and I will probably go back I won't hold this against them. What can I say stuff happens?? I usually get the number 9 which is a Del beef burrito,Fry's and a orginal taco and a mr. Pibb. What's your favorite combination to order?</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dca7f4ab1188fd:0x3e8188b30e8337ec</Gmap_id>< pics>

<Date>1554451769528< /Date><pics>None</pics><Text>Del taco located off the 60 freeway on Moreno Beach drive.  I walked into Del taco to place my order, and the person who took my order was Mr. Sergio, he has such an up beat personality and had a wonderful smile that made me feel good.  I normally order my food and go, but l decided to sit and eat my food there.  The tables and floor were clean and there was plenty of condiments.  My food was ready in no time so I sat down to eat and enjoyed the atmosphere which was quite nice inside.   I ordered the large del taco and a medium drink with a charro on the side, it was delicious.  Mr. Sergio thank you for making my day Pleasant with a wonderful smile and a great personality you are definitely a plus for the restaurant.  I Recommended this particular Del taco, its a Pleasant place to eat.   Walmart, Games stop, and other businesses are located in the same lot.  Plenty of parking and the parking lot is well lit at night.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

I rate Del Taco pretty high compared to the other major taco place however not this specifically location. I live near this location and unfortunately every time in recent months I've used the drive-thru it took it over 15 minutes, the longest taking up to 25 minutes.</Review>

I had a major issue with coupons with del taco but this is the only one in the Moreno valley area that was willing to work with me. I really appreciate their help and I recommend this restaurant over the elder avenue location.< /review>

Del taco is the best! Always open and food is usually really good. I came in on a Sunday afternoon and the dining area was very slow, but the drive-thru see very consistent with a steady stream of traffic. The food was good, not the best deltaco experience but average to above. I'll definitely be returning to this location.< /Text>

<Text>If I need a quick bite, and I'm near Moreno Beach, out of all the fast food I'll choose Del Taco. No matter how long the line is in the drive through, I always seem to get through super quick. Is the food the best? With any fast food it's always up in the air, and of course every location relatively stays the same, but I can say it's always good food, and they actually care to make their deluxe chilli cheese fries deluxe. Some places do a spurt of sour creme and the fries are dry, not here!< /Text>< user_name>

It's not my problem your speaker doesn't work for the drive-thru. Don't ask me or tell me to back up. If I can hear you and you can hear me, press your stupid fast food button. I don't really care. Fix your garbage drive-thru system.< /text>

I’m so happy with my meal today! The host Bryanna was so nice and genuine considering she took my order at 1:00 am :) The food was freshly made and everything was perfect! I believe it is very important to take note of the good work people put in. Thank you Bryanna!<//text>

Food was bad this time. Dried beans, small portions in burritos... How is a macho combo burrito smaller than a dollar bean and cheese burrito?< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>Just went in on 2/4/18 at around 1:50am.  Staff is extremely rude and undertrained.  The employee taking orders not only forgot his headset was still on but he had the nerve to complain about there being customers and having to work.  After complaining for a bit he realized his headset was on and didn't even apologize for being so rude.  I didn't even order anything because they'll probably make it wrong.<//review><UserId.>105892481032091378426<//UserId.>< Resp>

Waited there for 10 minutes just waiting to order food. And the whole entire time I watched them fill orders they were so very disorganized. I really don't know who is in charge of that store. Also I was Charged an extra .40 cents for jalapeños and didn't get them. Yeah can't even get an order right and they want $15 an hour!<//review>

Stopped here to grab a bite on our way home from the casino and even though there was only one small family of three other than me and my bf they took forever and the employees were arguing and bickering with each other over ridiculous minor things and there was only one napkin dispenser that was hidden as far in the corner of the ordering counter and they didn't give or offer us any at anytime so after having to get our food I had to get back up and hunt down some napkins while an employee watched me with a dumb look on his face 🙄 Should've taken 5 minutes but took 45!<//Review>
