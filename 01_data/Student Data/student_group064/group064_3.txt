The parking was criminal! The nonexistent pavement looked like bombs were dropped. I don't know why there were so many RVs taking up space but the obstacle course maze of RVs and potholes with the dust ploom getting out was fun but definitely could have done without.< /Text>

<text>This facility is not secured overnight. The pedestrian gates and doors to the buildings are left completely unlocked and in some cases left propped open. If they have an alarm system they don't set it.

I had a stack of boxes fall on me in one of their units. Totally my fault. But I was hurt pretty bad and I thought I should go to urgent care for the pain in my back and ankle. By the time I crammed the stuff back in my storage unit and hobbled to my vehicle, it was a few minutes after their 7:00pm closing time. When I entered my code to the vehicle exit gate it said "access denied, no after hours access." I found an employee named Diego who tried his gate code and got the same result. Diego said he would go to the office and get a gate code that would work. He never came back.

By 7:45 I had called every phone number I had for All Right Storage and sent them an email. I even called their facility in Irvine hoping to catch someone by luck. I decided to try to track down Diego or any other employee. For almost 2 hours I wandered that facility yelling and making noise. Walking in and out of buildings, through gates, opening closed doors, etc and no one ever approached me. I never set off an alarm. I never encountered a single employee or security patrol. Needless to say if I had been a thief, no one would have stopped me from popping every lock in that place. A thief couldn't get his car on property, but that's no problem since even their dolly and cart area was unsecured and all the pedestrian gates to the street were wide open. I eventually found a friend to pick me up and I had to return for my car the next day.

I spoke to the facility manager. Basically, his response was that I shouldn't have been there after 7 and it's normal for the entire facility to be left unsecured overnight. Because "in 8 years we've never had a problem." He said that to the guy with the problem, unbelievable, right?< /text><resp>None</resp>< Date>

Nice place to store your things. Cheaper than the other self storage places by twenty dollars. I rented a 5+8 on Main Street for $125. And it was a box. Here I’ve got a 10+10 for $110 and it’s huge with room up to the ceiling. Not limited like a box was. The only downfall is it’s not 24 hours. Other than that it’s a great place to store your things.< /review>

The staff is very friendly, but the have to adhere to instructions from their coorporate bosses. Most recently there has been an increase in the mouse population. Hopefully they will do something about it soon.<//review>< UserId.>

<review>The Place is affordable, clean, and the Staff are Awesome!!! I have been renting for 4 months and Rosa is AMAZING!
The only complaint for me is that some of the renters will park their trucks in the way but generally everyone is nice enough and respectful. I would rent here again! Also the trash cans are for the facility not really for customers but I never had to use them but once.</review>< Pics>

<Review>The accessibility (right in the heart of otay mesa off the cactus rd.), the hours are brilliant. The staff are awesome. Check out Rosa, she is the one who processed my account and Sergio got me a great unit when I needed to upgrade. Best prices. Busy place yet the halls are virtually vacant as if everyone were proportionally and perfectly placed. If you have tho.he to move on it out or both there is no one in Thoreau ever and the few folks you do run into are super polite. This storage with the best prices, super staff, smart location and hours along with a comprehensible contract has made me gladly take a few moments out to tell you why it's so great. Honestly, this place was here exactly when I needed it. Non nonsense staff and I do believe free truck usage to move yrself in. Not sure on that but I believe it is the case. Cannot go wrong. LOVE it. Thank you.</Review>< pictures>

<text>You can not reviece any mail from USPS which is a big problem if you need to receive letters or you need a po box. I used to like it but no anymore... plus my husband had to call the police to solve a issue with the owner. With so many storage options in san diego dont hassle with the headaches here!

Food is expensive for the portions they give. Not always warm and rice was ok last time. Workers give off a bad vibe when you walk in and with the way they take your order. Sometimes they're cool. 3 stars is for the bread and atoles they have.< /Text>

Burgers are pretty good. Fries can be improved. Shakes are very good. Service was good. Place was empty so service was fast.< /review>

<rate>4</rate><Review>I gave their portobello and swiss burger a try, and its a solid, above-average burger. The bun was really flimsy and fell apart after two bites, but the meat was flavorful, thanks to the grilled onions. We'll see how long it sticks around, given that In N Out is a few minutes away (and reigns supreme, IMO).</Review>< pictures>

Wide variety of inexpensive food.  Two can easily eat for under $20. Fast and friendly service.

Great spot for families.<//Text>

If you've never been to Steak 'n Shake outside of California then you will never know how good it really is.

Living in Florida, I always sit at the counter right where I can see them cook my burger fresh - with all the grease and all heat from the grill I watch my meal being cooked and prepared. Although I am thankful to the franchisees for bringing this out to the West, it is still a far distance from how it's really done and how it really tastes.

The burgers here at the Daly City location were dry as if they were reheated. The fries were cold and chalky. The shakes tasted like they came from a machine and not hand scooped and manually placed  in a mixer by servers as they do in the South. They didn't even have pepper sauce. When I asked the server he came back with black pepper. The only consistent thing that they offer here are the paperboard cars.

The service was horrible, checkout was long as they didn't seem to know how to use the Steak 'n Shake app.

Not a good experience and it just made me miss the real Steak 'n Shakes back in Florida along with that hometown Southern Hospitality.</review>

Not a great location to me. Hostess was nice but shy and spoke too soft. Clean eatery. Clean restroom. Waitres was very courteous and attentive. Quiet atmosphere inside but a bit busy outside. Ordered the Shooters with fries and a caramel turtle shake. Buns were a bit dry and not enough flavoring sauce. It was still warm and delicious. Fries are very thin but were made fresh and delicious. The shake was heavenly yum. The waitress brings the check but you pay at the register. My experience was enjoyable.</Review>

<Review>I used to love steak n shake when I visited other states. This one was way overpriced for the amount of food. I could have gone to a nice sit down restaurant for the price I paid here. The burgers were McDonald's size patties and the shake was barely blended. I could have out scoops of ice cream in a cup, waited an hour (which is how long we waited for 3 burgers and 3 shakes) and it would have been the same.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

My boyfriend loves their milkshakes but the last two he got tasted so freezer burned that he ended up throwing them out after a few sips.

<Review>In two words, don't bother.

I drive past this location every morning, and I have been eagerly anticipating the opening for weeks.  I didn't check the reviews before I visited so I could keep an open mind.  I had heard from friends that they waited in line for up to two hours before they seated.  That seemed reasonable for a new restaurant, but I soon discovered that the wait time was not because Steak 'n Shake had reached capacity.

We arrived at 2 pm on Friday.  Our arrival time was the best part of our visit because their milkshakes are 50% off on weekdays from 2 to 5 p.m.  The milkshakes are good, they have a large variety, and the price is reasonable at 50%.

On the other hand, they do not think of themselves as a fast-food joint even though the food is fast-food quality.  This means you cannot walk up to the counter and order takeout.  We watched multiple people park, enter the business, and try to order food, only to be rebuffed by the staff.

These people didn't know how lucky they were.  The primary problem with Steak 'n Shake is that it takes too long to get your food and the staff is low quality.  I noticed during the weeks leading to the launch date that they were willing to hire anyone without any experience and it shows in the front staff and the back.  After we had been seated, it took the waitress twenty minutes to take our order, and she had difficulty writing it down.  When you order a burger, you have several options for toppings (tomatoes, onions, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard).  The waitress wrote everything out longhand on a piece of paper instead of having a bunch of checkboxes.  Writing out an order takes longer and is hard for the kitchen staff to read.

Our food took over thirty minutes to arrive, and this is a common complaint - food takes too long to come and is cold when it gets to your table.  I was so amazed that I went to the kitchen area to observe the staff preparing the food.  There are a lot of people in the back, but the setup is inefficient compared to other burger places.  Two people are assigned to the grill and apparently spend their time trying to decipher the orders and figure out how many burgers and patties to cook.  Once the meat is ready, they assemble the burger and put it under a warmer.  At this point, another duo takes over and puts on the correct toppings.  Somehow this process takes forever, and the take-out queue is mixed in with the sit-down customers.

There are no napkins on any of the tables, and our table did not have ketchup.

Our food came before our milkshakes.  The burgers and the fries were both cold because they had been under a warmer for a long time.  Our order had two mistakes in it.  First, my wife ordered a burger with two patties but only received one patty.  When we brought this up with our waitress, she said the patties were thin, and there might be two in there.  We had to open up the hamburger before she admitted there had been a mistake.  She said it would take another thirty minutes to prepare the correct burger.  I asked if we could get our bill adjusted instead, and she replied that she would have to take it to her manager.

The second mistake was that my wife ordered a raspberry milkshake, but it did not come to our table.  Our waitress had forgotten to put it on the bill.  Fortunately, she found the drink in the kitchen.

The fries are thin, cold, and hard.

At this point, I began checking the reviews and realized our experience was not atypical.

The final insult came when I tried to pay for the bill at the counter.  The bill had increased from the first time I saw it.  The waitress added the shake to our bill but neglected to adjust it for the missing patty.  I had to explain everything to her again because she had completely forgotten the original complaint.

Tried once, never going back, don't waste your time.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Overall, food and shakes tasted straight up like fast food. Very McDonalds, or Jack In the Box. No way in the same league with Mels, Red Robbin, or Nations.

Yet, here, they seat you & wait on you, so you have to tip.  The wait staff seemed equal parts bright shiny new, sorta eager, & sorta lost. I left a good tip because they seemed to be struggling with the newness of it all.

If you must eat here, consider the drive through; Its probably faster, and I don't imagine you'd have to fork out a tip.<//text>

Steak and shake was like if Dennys only sold burgers and shakes and got some cheap white plates and increased their prices. Nothing about it makes me want to ever go back.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I grew up in St Louis eating steak n shake so I was super excited when the they opened up in Daly City but I was very dissaponted. It tasted nothing like it's sister stores in Missouri. It reminded me of fast food. It's too bad because all Cali people will never know what a true steak and shake is like. Burgers and fries don't taste right. The real steak n shake is a real sit down restaurant where they actually take your order and prepare super tasty food. Any one that has had real steak n shake would agree. It's disgusting food. Why go through all the trouble if your not going to do it right. No steak n shakes have drive thru because it's not supposed to be fast food. Food takes 2 minutes to get. Want a real steak n shake go to St Louis.<//Text>

This place has both a drive-thru, and a place to sit down and eat that feels like a restaraunt. The steak burgers are really good, but I think the milkshakes are the pinnacle of the experience. I've had several different flavors of milkshake from Steak 'n Shake and am yet to be disappointed with any of them. Easily one of my favorite places to get a shake.</review>

The food is great (the chili mac is amazing), but give it a few weeks for the craziness to die down and for them to settle into their operations flow. It's just a little slow right now with trying to run the dining room and drive thru simultaneously. Give them time. The staff and manager are also super friendly and apologetic, despite the only issue being that they are crazily busy.</Text>

They aren't doing the 24 for $4 promo. The chicken fingers were sad. Cost more than Popeyes and KFC's chicken and are just generic. My food was not hot at all. The thin fries are cool though. Lady who helped me with my carryout order was very nice. I will give it one more chance.<//Text>

< review>
A lot of the reviews are during their disastrous opening months, where they simply couldn't handle the crowds with newly trained workers... The service is good now that it's died down.... My only complaint is that the food isn't that great, though it's very cheap for the bay area... Beats the in n out Burger wait time but not as good< /review>

Nice new location, but something about the burgers seemed different from their midwest-based origins.... might have been the buns....will have to try it again.<//Text>

We waited in line for about 45 minutes. We ordered 2 double steak burgers, but the patties were like slivers of meat. It seemed as if they cut a normal patty in half to make a double. We were very disappointed. Burger looks nothing like what is on the menu.< /text>

Food is pretty good. However it takes FOREVER to get your food. On multiple occasions I have waited for 45+ minutes in the drive through... talk about self pity... either come when it isn't busy or don't come at all< /Text>

Shakes are awesome, Burgers tasty but a little small for the price, chili good, I strangely enough get the grilled chicken salad with guacamole instead of dressing(extra charge but reasonable) nice portion, very tasty. Service ok, but chili appetizer came to table before the water we ordered, still gave 20% tip cuz server was busy, they need a drink runner.<//Text>

Whaaaat is this???? I moved to California from the birthplace of Steak 'n Shake and this place is for shame. I understand the bay area is much more expensive than central Illinois but double the prices and removing a major part of the menu so you can double the prices is a bit much.</review>

NOT WORTH IT !!!!
my dad and i just went to steak n shake and i opened the bag and it smelled just like mcdonalds ! ! we got home and when i tasted the fries, it was cold, hard, and bitter. the taste was familiar to when you reheat mcdonalds fries but cold. my dad said that the burger was cold and too salty and the buns were stale and dry. the chicken fingers are okay... theyre a bit dry, but ranch made it a tad better. also , the shakes are too thick. to top all of my complaints, i noticed that the logo looks like wing stop's logo so... this was the worst meal ive had in my life. i shouldnt have spent $20 here.. (this steak n shake was in daly city btw)

Chapter One
We  first walked in and we're excited  but then we saw the wait,  so many empty seats but no one is being seated . It  was set up like a "fancy resturant" but obviously not because this  supposed  diner had a drive thru , ghetto much?? A  crappy female employee  was so rude and sarcastic to customers around us . We asked how long it would take twice and both responses were " i will alarm a waiter in a moment" nothing happened so i took matters into my own hands and went up to front desk. She once again gave me atittude and said the same lying crap. I told her that somebody around us  that got there after us got  to order before us .She  constantly said oh my God I am so sorry .While i was with her a lady behind my family started a convorsation with them starting off with "this wasnt worth it and its disgusting" After this we got up and left .  we weren't even across the street and they already somebodyelse down because theyre loosing costumers.  WORST RESTAURANT EVER!!!! #TEAMFIVEGUYS</Text>< pics>

Better than expected. Went in on a quiet sunday evening and wasnt in a hurry. I think a lot people these days miss the point of enjoying a meal. They go in too hungry that a perceived 5 min wait feels like 2 hours. The food and the shakes came out with supreme timing. Would recommend. Big leage shakes. Food isn't the most legendary; nonetheless tasty. Better than In n Out. Thier small cut fries remind me of pik niks. Can you dig it?

<review>01/04/2017 at 3pm update: I was pleasantly surprised giving this place a second chance.  You can read my first review below.  Drove right up to the speaker and ordered,  to the first window to pay,  and about 60 seconds for the car in front of me to get their food,  drove up to the second window and was immediately handed my food.  3 minutes tops and i was back on the road.  MUCH better than over an hour for 10 cars. If this is the knew norm,  i strongly recommend giving them a chance.  I haven't checked if they allow you to order to go yet.  But at least the drive -thru was a breeze.
Not Happy.  Food's decent. I prefer thicker fries. But they do not do to-go orders at the counter.  Dine-in or Drive-thru only.  Inconvenient when you're driving a dually truck weighing 11,000lbs. Well, let's go get stuck in the narrow drive-thru driveway and scratch my Alcoas. I would strongly suggest a walk-up window or to-go option so those of us who work AND drive for a living don't get stuck in the horrible drive-thru line.  20 cars took over an hour last time. And it's bloody stupid because the drive-thru line blocks anyone trying to park in their lot.  NO THOUGHT went into the parking lot. Don't worry about being able to find a parking spot because there are plenty available even at the busiest hour.  The problem is unless you're on a motorcycle or bicycle or walking,  you'll never make it to the spot.  And I've moved 2 car lengths in over 10 minutes.
Update,  3 car lengths in 20 minutes.  There goes my lunch.  I don't know about dine-in, but avoid the drive-thru unless you have AT LEAST 1/4 tank of fuel and feel like cross the bay bridge during rush hour.  What might work is to take your order, have you pay,  then park in the back area so you can take a power nap till your food is ready in an hour or so.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808f7c0ef773746f:0x723f4263a570e2d1< /GmapID><rate>1</rate><name>Joseph K</name>< UserId.>

This was a good late night spot. Had a great curry dish and they even shaped the rice like a heart! Some of the most amazing calamari I have ever had.</Text>

This place is right down the street from my work and I love their lunch special, it doesn’t hurt my wallet and gives me a great tasting meal.  I was their today and my rice came in the shape of a heart, idk why but I liked it.  The chicken was tasty and crunchy, the way it’s supposed to be. At first it seems like a lot but it was a perfect portion.

The only think I believe they need to work on is meal diversity. It seems like it’s a huge menus but it’s just the same items with different choices of meat. Or maybe reduce it and make it simpler to follow.</review>

My friend and I stopped by here to get a quick bite while walking downtown. The food was not very good and we each got hair in our food. She received a lovely black hair in her salad and I received another black hair in my soup. Completely different meals and yet, a hair in each. Disgusting. Won’t be coming back.<//review>

<rate>2</rate><Review>Stopped here on the way to a show at the Fox Theater. I noticed they offered a whole menu of martinis, so I ordered a gin martini. I don't know what I was served, but it was not what I ordered. I'm not even sure it was gin. I couldn't pinpoint the flavor. About 15 minutes after I ordered, I was served some kind of liquid in a margarita glass, with lime wedges. I could not finish the drink it was so terrible.

Bathroom requires obtaining a giant key from the staff, and when I was there, they seemed understaffed, so it took a while.

On the upside, the food was tasty with generous sizes.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb1f01ada29cb:0xaed0682ac14d3161<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>My husband and myself  always  come  and dine at this restaurant. We find it  a nice place to dine.  Few days ago we noticed they have new people (servers) and one doesn't get the order  only the payment. She is a Thai lady. When I followed up our order she said" the other lady get your order not me" in a loud like angry voice. She doesnt smile and  her face is not peasant to the costumers.I was shocked the way she responded me, maybe it is the way they are? but her costumer service is not nice to be in this place -California.  The management should train her how to handle  guest  or better yet she  will not talk to costumers and she will be assign in the kitchen.  I noticed one old lady guest talked to her for something  and when I turned my head to them the lady was so upset how she dealt the old lady costumer because that Thai server just walk away from her. I hope the management  will know about it . They are the only Thai restaurant in that Mission Inn Avenue and so they should maintain good costumer service. Yes it is nice to have Thai people server because  of the  concept they are carrying but make sure  to train your people.< /Text>< pictures>

I have been here a few times before I decided to commit to a 3 star review. Why did I give a 3 star review you ask? It's always just okay. Not bad, but okay. Yesterday we sat out side for lunch, and the lunch special seemed like a great deal, it came with an egg roll, a little salad and Tom Yum soup. Well we never got our soup, and I don't chase waiters around...< /Text>

Great Thai food that comes in all levels of spiciness. From very mild to wild hot and if you need more heat there's 4 great tasting hot sauces to add.<//text>

Nice thai place. Tried regardless of some of the other reviews. People were friendly and helpful. Money bags definitely was worth trying.</review>

<text>Let me start by saying that I have eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants and several times while visiting Thailand itself. After reading the mixed reviews, let me give you mine. My wife and I had the pad see ew with duck. I have never had a great plate of food with chunks of duck meat for less then $20. I paid $13 here and it tasted great!! Also had the seafood Currie with peanut sauce and that too was great at $14. For appetizers we had the crab Rangoon wontons and calamari that was awesome. Food came out quick and hot. Had a few Jack Daniels and coke at $5 a piece and can you say a Little coke with the Jack, it was almost a double. If your looking at great food for a great price, this is it. If you don’t have time to wait for good food, then go to a fast food restaurant. Will definitely be back again!!! Hope this helps</text>< Rating>

I’ve been here 3 times now with either friends or family and everytime the service and food has been wonderful! It’s not crowded so there is no wait. It really should be though because it’s a great place. My new favorite in downtown. P.s. I’m a resident so I’ve also tried another Thai place but this one is way better quality in taste.< /review>

Who are these fools saying that this place got them sick or is bad? This place is great and I did not get sick from any of the food. Just because food is taking longer than normal means the food will turn out better than to just hurry it. If you want fast food then go eat fast food and avoid restaurants. I like this spot and have it saved to go again anytime I'm in Riverside.<//text>

The service was great and very customer oriented. I got the vegetable pad Thai (since they were out of tofu). When I got it, it was a red color, no peanuts, and almost a solid mass. I wouldn't go there again especially because other people had similar complaints. My pad Thai sauce was thick and bland, vegetables didn't seem cooked, and the rice you could tell had sat out for awhile. Service was great but terrible food.</Text>

Not very impressed with this place - I had the kapow which was supposed to be spicy and it was so bland it would have been great for someone who loves flavorless things. Thai tea was powdery and sweet and my cup came super sticky I didn't even touch it. Hard pass.< /review>

Everything about this place is terrible. They claimed to have lost our order but it miraculously appeared when it was time to pay. The food was mediocre at best. It's over priced and underwhelming. Will never go back.< /Text>

<text>Our experience was alright. The food was alright but the service was terrible. We waited 45 mins for them to take our order and then an hour for them to tell us they had no more beef. They didn’t even give us our drinks we ordered. I found a hair in my food, which I for sure know it wasn’t one of mine and the waitress gave as attitude and was rushing us to order.<//text>< pics>

Drink orders  were 45 minutes apart. Service is very slow as there are not enough servers. The food, if you can get it, is good.</Review>< Resp>

Great food with fantastic staff. The houseade soy sauce is fantastic, ask for a thing of it with any meal and you will find out why when you try it I promise.</Review>

The food is good, but if you have a large group (I was there with a group of 6) service is really slow.< /Review>

<review>Worst Thai place ever!!  Service horribe, food horrible, and not worth the price.  Food was completely overpriced . We ordered the spring rolls 7.00 (which was actually not that bad), bbq chicken (the menu said it was grilled but clearly fried.  One bite and I had to spit out it tasted like the chicken had gone bad),  chicken cashew (veggies were not fresh at all) chicken pad see yew 10.00( which was the dinner entree, portions were like a kids size)  the Thai tea was served in a small glass for 3.00!!  We didn't get our food until about 40 minutes being in the restaurant.  The only good thing that came out of it was that 2 of the dishes was taken out of check after explaining 3 times yo 3 different waitresses Still our bill was 25.00 and we didn't even enjoy it  what a waste of time and money.   I will never go back to that place.  If your looking for a good Thai restaurant Best Thai on spruce is AMAZING and Little Buddha in Mira Loma is definitely better than  this place</review>< pictures>

<Text>My wife had a bug in her food and the main waitress came and just removed it. Didn't even offer to replace the plate. I was missing Baby Corns and Mushrooms from my plate. After I showed them the description on the menu they took it back and added them on. Should've comped our bill. When my wife asked for refill of her drink they said no refills. Wouldn't recommend, would not go back.</Text>< GmapID>

Food used to be good but I came here for lunch and the pad Thai was mushy and the service was non existent with the owner and her daughter laying out their drama at a table less than three from me where their employee was chopping limes. Not professional at all.< /Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Today was my first visit at AV Sierra Dental Center, and it was an excellent experience. The visit was pleasant from start to finish. Check-in was hassle free, I was seen in a timely manner, and I feel they were very honest with me. Dolores was very personable. Dr. Oh addressed my issues with care and gave me knowledgeable advice. Colleen finished up my visit by explaining details and answering all my questions. Overall I would highly recommend, and I will be returning.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>The girls on the phone were very nice. The girls at the front desk were also great! My hygienist Christina is SUPERB (takes a while to get an appt with her - I guess the secret of how good she is is out!). Dr. Oh is a wonderful dentist.  He is extremely gentle, personable and most knowledgeable.

I would give the office 10 stars if I could! Don't bother reading anymore - go to AV Sierra Dental Center! You won't be disappointed!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This office has exceptional customer service... My child was able to be seen for a same day appointment due to discomfort, and they did everything they could to accomodate us. We are new to the area and I am so relieved to have found such a great Dental office that includes both friendly staff and friendly dentists.. It is hard to find a good office with both.  The office is clean, the staff is welcoming, and I appreciate the extra seat offered in service areas for parents, or your plus one (This isn't always offered in all dental offices). This office definitely has clients comfort in mind and even offers TVs hanging from the ceiling while receiving care, I was very impressed by that. Wish I could've taken a picture..  Next time! Was very pleased with our first time visit.<//Text>

This is the most amazing dental office ever! The environment is so comfortable and professional, absolutely everyone there is so kind. I personally have had Alyssa as my hygienist for a couple years and she’s amazing! I actually look forward to going to the dentist every time because of how great my experience always is! Highly recommend.</Text>

< Review>
Great dentist! All of the staff are kind and very professional. Dr. Oh and Dr. V take their time with you and explain everything. They are truly caring and do their best to make your experience as comfortable as possible.

<Text>My son had his first dental visit! Both the hygienist and the doctor were wonderful. My other son has been there twice and he loves everyone. It’s clean, the staff is incredibly friendly, and worth every moment. Thank you AV Sierra Dental. My family (and my friends) love you all!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>First time at AV Sierra Dental and I could not be happier. Called to make an appointment and was given an appointment that worked for my scheduled and only a couple days away. As soon as I walked in I felt it would be a good visit. Beautiful and clean office, front office staff so professional and sweet. Did not wait long in the reception area and was taken to a room. Staff was attentive, Doctor had a great bed side manner and they didn’t want to charge me $1k on my visit. Couldn’t be happier and already have a second appointment made:<//review>< Response>

First time going there and it’s the best dentist in the AV that I’ve been to. I’ve tried plenty over the years never satisfied because most dentist don’t care about you they only care about your money.
This was the first time I’ve have both the hygienist and the dentist really take in consideration all of my problems and make me feel like they genuinely cared. I would recommend everyone to go there.< /Text>

My wife found this dentist office via it's high review score and has since convinced me to come to AV Sierra Dental as well. We love the office and staff so much that we are changing insurances so that we can continue to come in for In-Network costs. I couldn't recommend this office enough!< /review>

This Dental center elevates dental care to an art. Their concern for the patient, empathy, service, attention to detail, pride of workmanship and craftsmanship. Dr. O has corrected some incorrectly completed work done by another dentist, saving me from future issues. The support staff are top notch, helpful, informed and they really show they care in all they do, even to the follow up phone call. This is the best Dental care available anywhere, I won't go anywhere else!</text>

I got all four wisdom teeth out today and they constantly asked if I was ok and comfortable. They finished around 10:30am and it is now 7:30pm and I still don’t feel any pain. I got the stem cell recovery and I HIGHLY suggest it. Dr. V even called around 4pm to check on me and make sure I was doing ok. Love this dentist office and everyone that works there. If I could give 10 stars I would.<//text>< pics>

<review>I recently moved to the AV valley and had been looking for a great dental office and I have to say I found what I was looking for. This office is great ,from the friendly and clean office to outstanding service, they make you feel so welcomed. Cynthia and Dr.Villar are amazing and are very thorough with what’s going on and what needs to be done. And finally Jazmin the coordinator went over my coverage and plan and options w a smile. And the fact that it’s 5 min away from my office is the cherry on top. I highly recommend this office.!!< /review>< pics>

<Review>Amazing staff from the beginning. This was my first time going to AV Sierra Dental Center and I will definitely be going back.  I was helped by Alyssa and Dr. Brandon Villar and I can say without a doubt that I received the best service I could have. Dr. Villar called me same day by 6:00 to see how I was doing after my visit. The entire team is friendly and welcoming. Vanessa helped me with billing and to schedule my upcoming appointment. I actually look forward to going back to the dentist because of this experience. I can honestly see why they are rated 5 stars which is why I went to them in the first place. You will not be disappointed.😃< /Review><username>Erik Valencia</username><user_id>100506350626513948549</user_id>< pictures>

Our family had been looking for a new dentist for a while and after reading so many incredible reviews, we had to give AV Sierra Dental a try.  Everyone was incredibly kind, professional, knowledgable, and accommodating.  In a world where customer service no longer seems to be a priority, AV Sierra Dental has revived my hope. Thank you to a wonderful team of professionals whose caring hearts and dental care is top notch.  So grateful.❤<//Text>

My wisdom teeth were removed today and I received such care and confidence from Dr. Villar and Jenny that I am so happy I chose this office for my dental work.
The process was fast and they made sure I understood everything going on as well as aftercare for myself leaving the office. I even received a check in from Dr. Villar later in the evening to make sure I was doing okay.
The time and care this office puts into their patients is definitely one of the reasons I will keep coming back.</Text>

They welcomed me with very pleasant smiles.  Their clinic was so well sanitized exceeding my expectation. I value it is most important at this time.

They put in my implant so seamless that I feel the new implant is better than my natural teeth. Thank you. They cleaned my teeth so softly and nicely. I feel so good and pleasant after I got it done. In a word, they are the best as far as I know. I will never stop coming to AV Sierra Dental Center for my dental need. Thank you again.< /Text>

Found AV Sierra Dental on Yelp. This dental office had the highest ratings and most positive reviews, therefore I decided to call for an appointment. They were able to schedule me for a same appointment. When I arrived, I immediately noticed the cleanliness of the waiting room and reception area. They have taken great measures to make the office meet Covid protocols. The ladies in reception were very professional, polite and accommodating. I was seen after a short wait. As a matter of fact, I didn’t wait long for anything. Everything happened in quick succession- the hygienist, xrays, doctor, recommended treatment, financial arrangements and cleaning. My hygienist, Alyssa, was very comforting and cordial. Dr. Oh was very thorough and educational without being too technical. Overall, I had I great experience and would recommend AV Sierra Dental to anyone seeking excellent and professional dental attention.<//review>

Dr.Oh and staff are great! They care about you, they are happy to help . For me I  had a cleaning with Alyssa who is a pleasant bundle of happiness at 8:30 in the morning. She also updated with pain-free xrays(can't say that often). Dr. OH is great he's soft spoken ,clear in explanation and while having 2 fillings done on my front teeth without any shots I m happy to say I  have a smile again. Finances were worked out by Vanessa who took the time to recalculate so I  can look forward to returning in a couple of weeks for more work. I  know what I  am getting  from AV SIERRA DENTAL will be better than anything other place could provide. I highly recommend Dr. Oh and staff. You will leave with a smile.  😀< /Review>

<text>Today was my daughter’s first dentist appointment. My little one was a little scare and nervous at first but she braved through it. Thanks to Dr. O and Jessica, at Sierra Dental Center, they were so sweet, gentle, and patient with her that maid her first experience a blast. She did so well and was so happy that she came home pretending she was a dentist with her Barbies lol< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This is my first time experience with AV Sierra Dental. I was looking for a new dentist since my previous dentist retired. The whole experience from making appointment, filling out insurance information (online) before the appointment date through the end of exam and cleaning was absolutely a pleasant one. They work as team to make sure your visit to dentist is as wonderful as it could be. Their facility is modern and the equipment are the latest.  My dental hygienist (I think her name is Alyssa) was amazing. She was not only thorough getting the job done well but was super friendly and make the cleaning experience (usually unpleasant) a very positive one. They also explains everything what is going on I was informed with every steps or procedures I sent through. I highly recommend this place to anyone who need dentist works.</Text>

<Review>A very nice place. Dr Oh is such a nice dentist. He wants you to be comfortable and he makes sure the work is done right.
He and his staff are wonderful and caring.
They relocated and I followed them to the new location. If your looking for a dentist for your family. Try AV Dental.</Review>< pics>

Such a great, and wonderful experience! Before coming to AV Sierra Dental Center I had been to other Denist and I felt like the only thing they cared about was my money. With AV Sierra Dental Center it was all about me and my dental care. I had such a thorough consultation like never before, I loved it! My Dental Hygenist Alyssa, was so wonderful and so gentle when working on my teeth. I definitely recommend them. They will be my go to as well as for my family.< /text>

Amazing CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  Thank you very much Colleen!!!!   I found this office on yelp and reached out to them because my husband had an emergent situation with his teeth.   Colleen at the front desk was kind, professional, informative from the beginning.   When we arrived we were greeted and the place is CLEAN, beautiful to be honest.  Everyone greets you and makes you feel so welcome.   Absolutely recommend!!!!!    This dental practice. The doctor, and assistant Alyssa were so patient, kind you never feel rushed or pressured.   From beginning to end you feel like family.    Thank you Colleen and entire staff  for helping us and making us feel safe and welcome.<//text>

Dentist was great. They accomdated my son in their schedule even though they do not specialize in pediatric dental. Very affordable prices during these crazy times when dental insurance isnt an option. Excellent communication with my son who was terrified at first but they had patience with him and in the end he was happy and running around like nothing ever happen. Thank you AV Sierra Dental for helping my son. Have a Happy Thanksgiving!</Review>

I’ve been a patient at AV Sierra Dental Center for over five years and can truly say that I am very happy with my experiences there. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the doctors are caring. I would highly recommend this dental office. They are taking great care dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic issues. The office is very modern with all the latest and greatest equipment.</Review>

100% recommend!! I found this place on Yelp and this is the best dentist office I’ve ever been to!! Not only are they are fast about getting you seen and treated, but all of the hygienists, staff and dentists care about the health of your teeth and making sure you feel comfortable getting the help you need. In their new patient questionnaire they even ask if you feel anxious around dentists. Just from that question I could tell that they understand where their patients are coming from and want to do their best to help them and restore their trust in dentistry. I really like how they take sooo many images of your teeth and actually go over what’s going on in your mouth! I swear I got a tooth by tooth play through. It’s all actually kind of cool and very thorough and I knew immediately I could trust them. You can tell everyone here loves their job and helping people. Going here for treatment restored my faith in dentistry.

The facility is clean, modern, and has covid precautions. All the staff is friendly and welcoming. I met like 4 hygienists in 2 days including Alyssa, Cynthia, and Trish everyone was friendly and happy to help. Vanessa from accounting was also very nice and helpful and all the ladies at the front desk are all professional kind and welcoming.

Basically if you are looking for a place that you can trust don’t hesitate to call. They will have your best interest and you’re teeth’s health at heart. You’ll be happy that you came in.

I was treated by Dr. Villar. I came in for a cracked molar that had turned into a deep cavity. When we spoke he made it clear that you have to try and do everything you can to save the tooth first and a root canal should always be a last resort. After seeing the x-rays and cold testing my tooth we came up with a treatment plan for me to get a distil wedge and a deep filling in an effort to save my tooth before we try anything else. He made it clear the entire time that he wanted to give my tooth a fighting chance. I came in the next day and was feeling a little anxious since this was my first filling in like 20 years, but he made sure I was comfortable and ready for the procedure. Apparently the crack was larger than we thought and I ended up having to get a crown lengthening in addition to my distill wedge because of how much my tooth had been cracked. I was impressed with his ability to think creatively, work delicately and do what needed to be done to save my molar. He made sure I understood what was going on the entire time and even showed me images of my tooth when he had cleaned it out on the screen. Which was pretty gnarly but also cool. I remember he was very happy when he finally got to fill the filling because we’d been there for 3 hours!!! I also appreciate how he made sure my stitches were in tight for the crown lengthening and distill wedge. He even called the next day to see how I was doing post surgery. I’m currently healing, hopefully the treatment is success. I am looking forward to coming in for my next appointment. I am so glad I finally got the help I needed and found a place I can trust with my teeth.< /text>

<Text>Clean establishment. Just visited for X-rays and prognosis so I can’t speak to the services performed but they were a professional staff.

Update after two cleanings and some more invasive work (about a year.) Very responsive staff. They were even able to get me a quick entry before insurance changes to get some work done. Love all the staff. Super friendly. Super COVID safe. Big shout out to all the Admin crew making moves and helping along the way. Feels like home here.

I actually enjoy going to the dentist. I know it's hard to  believe, but when you dont feel pain or not to much your at ease. This office staff is the greatest. The doctors are very gentle for like myself I had a lot of anxiety at first but now I almost fall asleep in the chair. Thank you Sierra Dental.< /review>

I want to start out by saying that I wish there were more stars to give as AV Sierra Dental definitely deserves it. I had a considerable amount of pain on Friday night and after getting no sleep I reached out to their office after reading many reviews and they did not disappoint starting with the answered call.  Colleen was beyond wonderful bearing with me and answering all my questions and after a call back scheduled me an emergency appointment for that morning.  I am extremely nervous in the dental chair but Crystal (I hope I got that right) and Dr. O were beyond welcoming, gentle and patient.  They couldn't pull my tooth that day due to bad infection but got me medication and scheduled me for Monday afternoon.  Monday was just as pleasant as they were so patient with me and very gentle.  In less than an hour the tooth was gone and the whole thing was painless and I didn't really even feel the injection much.  Dr O took his time explaining everything to me and making sure I was comfortable.  The assistant was amazing as well (i'm so sorry i forgot you name but you were awesome) and I truly felt like I had been going to their office for years not just a first time patient.  Colleen my treatment coordinator was amazing discussing treatment and fees with me as well as all of my options.  From the first phone call to making my next appointment everything was beyond my expectations and made this dental chicken feel safe, welcome and comfortable.  Sivenn one of their amazing hygienists who was an acquaintance took time out her her schedule to welcome me and make me feel comfortable!!! My family and I have found our dental home and cant wait to get back to dental health which i've neglected for too long.  If the office reads this....From the bottom of my heart, Thank you!!!!  I am appreciative of everyone and everything you did for me.  Although I can tell you treat everyone this way you made me fell like I was the offices priority which is a rarity these days!  Blessings. JG

Positives: Minimal wait time; very clean office; tight yet efficient Covid policies and procedures; friendly and warm staff; affordable treatments; technologically up to date; attentive to patients needs and fears; family atmosphere

Negatives: NONE....let me say that again....None :-)</Text>

This was my first vitro see Dr. Oh. The official staff are very friendly and got me in the same day as I was having tooth pain. The office is really a state of the art  system. The office follows strict Covid 19 protocols without being intrusive. It was a wonderful experience and I highly recommend this office for services. I’ve already booked my next appointment for a general exam.< /Text>

< Review>
Came in as a first time client and the staff did a great job of making me feel welcome. They have implemented procedures to keep them and the gust safe from the Covid19. For example, when you arrive they will ask you to wait in the car while they are ready.
Alyssa did my dental cleaning on my visit and she was great. She did detailed work and had no pain during or after my appointment. If your on the fence about trying a new dental office you should give them a try.< /Review>

I really wasn’t sure checking in from the car was going to work but it did and I didn’t wait past my appointment time I think I was even taken in a little early.

<text>When I called to tell you I was there for my appointment, I was told to come in.  To my surprise, there was two gentlemen standing at the front desk, and I was unable to come in until they where processed.  I was concerned about social distancing in the office, and I am hoping this can be reviewed to make it easier for coming into your office.  My visit was good after I got into one of the dental rooms.  Elaine Heber< /text>< pictures>

I love this dentist out of all the dentists I have been to this is the best. They are caring, they make you feel like family. Easy to be seen they are fast. If I could give 10 stars I would. My son gets his braces done there to and they do great work.<//Review>

<review>Awesome place extremely friendly staff, they take extra caution to protect patients and staff from spreading (Covid-19) if you’re unsure it’s safe I have to say this is probably the safest place you can be. I recommend AV Sierra Dental to everyone I know. I will never go to another dental office again. My finally found a dental office I feel safe and secure taking me family. They are hands down the best dental office I’ve ever been to.</review>< Pictures>

<resp>None<//resp><rate>5<//rate><Review>If you are looking for cleanliness, professionalism, friendliness and a good dental work then just stop searching any further and book your appointment with av Sierra dental!
I know a lot of people are scared and don’t like going to the dentist and trust me I’m the biggest one of them all, I haven’t seen a dentist in a veryyyyy long time and thats due to past experiences that has happened twice so trust me when I say av Sierra dental totally changed my mind. Over the weekend I ended up having a breakage on my back lower tooth and was going to go where my kids usually go, but saw av Sierra pop up first and saw how many reviews and stars they had, then I went on Yelp and saw some more amazing reviews especially reviews from people who also have the same fear I had. Anyways I called Monday morning hoping they can get me in and yup I got an afternoon appointment, filled out all my paper work online and done! I received a call an hour later telling me they had an earlier opening and I could come in.
Now as soon as a walk in I’m greeted with smiles and the cleanliness of the office with the air filters and the oil diffusers really made it feel clean and nice especially times like these you want your doctors/ dentist office in tip top shape. I waited 10 mins tops before I was called in had my temp checked and was asked to rinse my mouth with mouth wash which I didn’t mind at all! After that I’m meet with 2 amazing nurses one who took my X-ray right there in my room with amazing tools that made it easier then here comes my doc Dr Villar very friendly explained everything in detail with what we can do, what he wants to do and what’s the best option to make sure I don’t lose a tooth. Off the bat I was nervous but the went away pretty quick I felt comfortable. They constantly changed their gloves and made sure I wasn’t in any pain and really took care of me. I also wanted to add how Dr Villar called me the next day to make sure I was okay and didn’t have any issues or pain issues (major plus)!!
Everything was absolutely amazing and I can honestly say I’m looking forward to my next visit and continuing my check ups not to mention my kids will now have a new dentist and that right there makes me feel 100 times better since I know they will be in good hands. A HUGE Thank you to the  AV SIERRA DENTAL TEAM for seriously making my bad experiences end!!<//Review><name>marian rios</name>< GmapID>

I have a new dentist now.  They took me in for an emergency situation and treated me with great compassion and care.  Can't say enough about them!  Also very impressed by the high tech equipment and services.   Makes my old dentist looks like they are stuck in the 80's.< /Review>

I recently have had an experience at this location that is more than worth talking about. I have spent YEARS not only being anxious about but truly hating dentists. Dr. Oh and his staff approach dentistry with a completely different energy. I needed a crown repaired and they have done a great job getting me set up with a solution.

Also I was called at my home after my procedure to make sure things were going well by the Dr. Oh himself. The dude actually cares and it shows. If you need a different dental experience like I did. Check em out.< /text>

<review>AV Sierra Dental Center👨‍⚕️ is the place to be.💯 I found this Dental office on google maps and decided to give it a try. First I called to schedule an appointment due to this covid 19 pandemic😷 I new I couldn't just walk in lol. The lady I spoke to over the phone was so polite 🥰and patient 🤗she answered all of my questions and scheduled me for a next day appointment 🙌 they sent me a text message to a link to fill out my application over the phone amazing technology they have. 👩‍💻 When I arrived to the facility my mask was on & they greeted me with a warning hello their smiles were so bright I just knew they must have had dental work done here lol🤣Well they screened me ain't no fever 🤒 here I'm clear to go💃. This place is amazing they have new technology & tools some Dental offices that I've been to don't have like digital teeth Xray screening😁.

My wife found this place due to the 5 star reviews. We live 40 miles away and she decided to go with the best reviewed Dental Office. Took me a year but finally realized it was worth it myself to go with Dr Oh and his staff. They truly are all amazing from the front office to the specialists in the back. They all care personally and passionately and Dr Oh's demeanor is honest and authentic..... that's the heart of this place.

So, if you find yourself looking for a place that doesn't look at you as just a bag of money and will scare you into treatment that's questionable, this is the place that will take care if you like a human. His diagnosis is rational and pure< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I came to AV Sierra Dental to have a full mouth restoration. Dr. Oh previously had done dental work for my fiance and not onIy was the work done beautifully but they treated him so well. I have a chronic autoimmune disease and medications destroyed almost all of my teeth. I needed a very skilled and knowledgeable dentist and I found that dentist in Dr. Jason Oh.

I have seen specialists, all kinds of doctors, dentists and none of them could even compare to the expertise, compassion, and understanding of Dr. Oh. I asked questions, interrupted at times and always was given a patient, thorough explanation.

I had every single tooth worked on with great pain control. He was so gentle, I found myself falling asleep often. His assistants are so caring and skilled as well. I had the pleasure of having Lupe, Dolores and Jennifer (each at different appointments) in the room helping Dr. Oh, while making sure I was comfortable the whole time. After intense dental work, Dr. Oh would even gave me a call to be sure I wasn't in pain and doing well.

I cannot recommend a dentist and dental office more than I would AV Sierra Dental. I'm in my 50s, have seen many dentists throughout my life and I trust Dr. Oh with all my heart. And you know when you go into a dental office or any office and the doctor is the best but the staff isn't so welcoming? It's the complete opposite here. Everyone is so kind. From the moment you walk in, you're greeted with a warm welcome. You feel comfortable immediately.

I've had my teeth cleaned by both of the hygienists and both were so gentle, so kind and gave me great tips to keep my mouth healthy. They both completely eased my anxiety.

If you're fearful of dentists or simply want an excellent dentist, don't hesitate to make an appointment. With my health not being the greatest, I was fearful of anyone working on my teeth. Not only was my health taken in consideration, my dental work and treatment was done in the safest, best way for me. My teeth are perfect!I have so much respect, gratitude and love for Dr. Oh and his staff. They gave me back my smile.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I had my first visit at the new office recently; it's really modern and elegant. Dr. Oh and his staff were all warm and welcoming to myself and all the other patients I saw during my visit. Everyone makes you feel very comfortable with their words, actions, and amenities. Visiting AV Sierra Dental Center is actually a treat instead of a chore!

Update: I went for a long overdue check up post COVID. All staff were happy to welcome me back. I got to work with Trisha for the first time. She was very sweet, friendly, and professional. It's always great to work with Christina who always does a thorough job! Dr. Oh and his team are the best!!< /Review>

My family and I are new patients at this office and from the first visit it’s been a great experience. Dr. Oh is the best dentist I’ve ever been to and his staff is very friendly and welcoming. My 2 daughters are little and used to always need happy gas to sit through a visit with our old dentist but here they feel so comfortable already, that they’ve been great without it.

I’ve had a deep cleaning and zoom whitening with great results here. Their office manager Jane is very knowledgeable and professional. She has been very helpful in getting all of our billing questions answered in a timely manner as well as offering payment plans. Unlike the place I used to go to, they do not have long wait times.

This office has definitely made a visit to the dentist a lot more enjoyable.<//text>

<date>1556044059564</date><Text>Today was my 1st time visiting AV Sierra dental. I had a very pleasant experience at this dental office. My 1st reaction was that the staff is very professional, accommodating and very nice.  After completing my initial information I didn't have to wait for more than a minute to be taken to a room.  Got my x-rays and gosh within 2 minutes Dr. Bay walked in and introduced himself.  I was very pleased that he took the time to review every single one of my x-rays, we discussed my concerns, his plan of action and what he recommended.  After that It probably was 3-4 minutes when the coordinator came in and discussed my coverages my cost and the plan.  I cannot Express how great it feels to be treated like a patient and not just another number.  I've been in the AV for 18 years and my family and I have gone to many dentist here in the AV and SCV and one thing that just kills me is the length of time I've had to sit there with a scheduled appointment sometimes up to 2 hours.  Thank You Dr. Bay for respecting your patients time and for an awesome service. And yes the office decoration is nice, very clean, it smells good, state of the art equipment and an awesome bathroom.<//Text><Name>lissette sanchez< /Name>< gmapID>

<Text>My review is long overdue!! Before visiting AV Sierra Dental Center, I had been to a handful of dental offices in the AV in attempt to find the dentist for me. Dr. Oh has done such a great job with my various dental procedures (including a dental implant). The rest of the staff is lovely!! You get treated kindly, respectfully, and never feel pressured to have a procedure if it's not the right time. I have recommended most of my family members and they also appreciate the work done at AV Sierra Dental. I love this group and will be following them to their new office :)< /Text>< username>

Great place with a friendly staff. I didn't feel a thing. Dr. Oh is a genuine humble man who's work is effective and as painless as I've ever had. Very easy going staff with all types of fun and perky personalities. They make you feel as comfortable as you can possibly be at a dental office. Jane is amazing and very knowledgeable. She figures out a game plan with you so you know exactly what you are getting and when. Christina's a great hygienist and even hums songs while she cleans your teeth. You can tell right away she enjoys what she does for work. Jenny is very nice and always greets with a smile. Dolores is awesome while assisting with the Dr. Overall, a great place for your friends and family to get dental work. I have now seen why this place has such great reviews on FB, Yelp and here!!< /text>

<Text>Dr.Oh is the kindest and most caring dentist I have ever been to. I am a new patient and from the moment I called to make an appt, a dental assistant 'Jennifer' welcomed me on board. Not only are they a wonderful  and skilled dental practice but they truly care about people. For the first time ever going to a dentist I felt like they really wanted to care for me and my needs. I HIGHLY recommend them. Excellent Quality, Professional with a family atmosphere and they aim to please. Thank you so much "all the staff' for making me feel like part of your family!!!<//Text>< pics>

I went in for the 1st time Monday 3/26 because I was having severe pain from my bottom left wisdom tooth. Dr. Oh saw me and he recommended I return to remove all 4 of my wisdom teeth. He knew how nervous I was but assured me everything will be fine.
I went in today 4/5 at 10 a.m. for my procedure. Dr Oh and his lovely assistant Lupe took good care of me. Lupe held my hand and reminded me to just breathe and relax. Dr oh was done by 10:58! Wow! I'm so happy I found them. This is my place! They staff over all is amazingly kind and very helpful. Thank you Dr. Oh and Lupe!<//review>

This is a great dental center right here in the AV. No need to drive to Los Angeles for your dental care. Dr Oh and his staff are friendly, knowledgeable and most importantly really know what their doing....!!! My entire family has undergone dental work here with great results and very little pain. The hygienists here are excellent as well.  I would highly recommend AV Sierra Dental Center to anyone in the AV looking for a good dentist. My rating: Five Stars....!!!!</text>

My family and I have been patients for six years, and would not have it any other way. The staff that have gotten to know me personally are amazing, and me and my family feel welcomed there. I highly recommend them!!!</Text></record>

I have always had a great experience at AV Sierra Dental Center. The staff is amazing!   They are very professional,  friendly,  and attentive.  The facility is clean and organized.  Scheduling has been a breeze. They also send text reminders,  which have been very helpful. On numerous occassions,  they made accommodations for my children and I, just so we were comfortable during our appointment.  I will continue to come to this facility for my dental care. I definitely recommend it.< /review>

<review>I was very impressed by Connie how she explained all my options and answered my follow up questions. Christina, the dental hygienist, was equally impressive as she took the time to explain the cleaning procedure and X-Rays as she was administrating them. Overall, this is a place that I would recommend to any resident of the Antelope Valley for their long term dental needs.< /review>< pictures>

<text>My experience there is always awesome, the staff is friendly and the dentist goes completely out of his way to please the costumer. Once I got there and the dentist was about to close the office, him and one staff member was closing and I told him I had a chipped tooth in the front of my mouth and was embarrassed to talk or smile so what he did next surprised me he told the staff member to prep a room as she was going out and he personally got on the computer to check me in then did a fantastic job of reparing my tooth. Best dentist with a good heart good luck trying to find a better place with decent prices AV Sierra is the place I go to for all my dental needs I would recommend to anyone to bad this app doesn't have 10 star they earned it thank you AV Sierra😁<//text><username>some guy<//username>< Rate>

A month ago I was so upset with my former dentist and the service I received that I broke with the rest of my family and sought my own dentist.  I read the reviews of AV Sierra Dental on line and took my toothe ache and disgruntled self there.

I have not been so happy with a dentist since I was a child!  The service at this office is five star.  You are treated well from the time you first sign in until you sign out.  This applies to the office personnel, hygienists and Dr. Oh himself.

The office staff is sincerely caring and my visit with Dr. Oh was a great relief.  If you have postponed visiting the dentist, as I have, because visiting your dentist has been unpleasant, you should give Dr. Oh and his staff a try.

I have been back twice for follow ups in the past month, and the atmosphere has been consistently positive.    One of the best things I did this year was leave my old dental office (almost a ten-year relationship) to find Sierra Dental.

I  actually  look forward to seeing my dentist.  What a concept!< /review>

I went in feeling a lot of pain because of a broken tooth and was hesitant because of past experiences... Dr. Oh was great along with all the staff and i look forward to maintaining my dental health again after years refusing to see the dentist. Thank you for renewing my faith in the dentists office! I would most definitely recommend this office to anyone looking for a dentist.< /review>

I am a true fan of AV Sierra Dental Center - I first found AV SD and Dr. Oh on Yelp and have been a fan ever since. As a dental patient, I can appreciate Dr. Oh’s swift and trained hand and professional demeanor. I was dreading my appointment for wisdom tooth removal because of a pervious terrible sci-fi-like experience. This was defeintely not the case with Dr. Oh. He and his staff were very accommodating and eased my nervousness. He quickly removed my tooth and the whole thing took less than ten minutes without any post-removal issues and almost no pain.

Svette (I am sure I am spelling her name wrong, sorry) is my dental hygienist technician. She takes her time to clean my teeth and really listen to my dental issues or concerns. I make sure to schedule my appointments with her when I am due for my cleanings.

I am very satisfied with AV Sierra Dental :)<//Review>

There's ample parking across the street and this facility is very well maintained. I came here for the Newport Beach Wine Festival and it was packed! There were a ton of people but they all had a place to walk, sit, and there were many restrooms all around. You can see outside really well too because there's a nice tinted glass all around the community center.<//Review>

Holy S##T does Newport Beach have oodles of money.  The public art, ultra-modern digs, landscaping and... land... Very very very impressive. Nice public restrooms too.  $145 million (for a city of 85,000)< /Text>

New sculptures to view & take photos of in the park. The colorful Popsicles sculpture has arrived! Take your Christmas pix with it as a SoCal novelty for those in more wintery climes!< /text>

The City of Newport Beach has several facilities available for rent to the public. This Community Room overlooks both the Sculpture Exhibition in Civic Center Park and the Civic Green. Many events are held here and it has been used often for weddings. It was open in mid-2013.<//Text>

<review>It was chaos. Food basket line was in front of the toy line.Smashed together. Then everyone with toys had to back track BACK THROUGH the food basket line. Instead of opening an other DOOR to usher the families & kids &toys out away from the f b line. When someone actually fell because of being smashed, I went to get an officer. Youth who were helping direct people in this hallway were of no use. Didn't know anything. People were just forcing their way into FB line who were supposed to be exiting toy line. Could of been GREAT , with more direction and another door OPENED by toy exit. Kids with their new bikes and Toys, and strollers were stuck , smashed in the crowd. Thank You, Merry Christmas .< /review>< Pictures>

The surroundings are fine and untainted! Anything is either brand new or newly purchased. I'm attempting to get from my condo to a crowded shopping center. I purchased things that were both high in quality and moderately priced when I was here last week. This is an absolute must-try!< /Text>

Clean organized. 4 starts because Customer service was abrasive and rude when I was returning unopened items the next day. Not sure why. This was today at noon and 30 min. Female, brown long hair. Great location in the beach with ample private parking. Ralphs is always my favourite store to do groceries.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPE8HxTEtG-M8qXLHKg5Lw7rx-SlwLCuVoBuzyK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtw4XRdihVZW1-x1C7m3rOvDsobaQEQb9SaJHm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dc01ed999e1289:0x29c17ed4189fbec0</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I love diet Sunkist, and they always have it stocked. I got my covid-19 vaccine here, and it was a seamless process. I appreciate the easy parking on the lower level of the store since PB parking is always such a pain.< /Review>

Great grocery store for when traveling to Mission Beach. There is parking underground which is great so you can still drive your car there and not worry about parking on the surrounding surface streets. Found everything we needed here. Highly recommend it.<//Review>

<text>This store has been the best spot for me so far. You can buy anything you need here at a very inexpensive price, the service workers are attentive, even the security guards are polite and kind. It's not crowded, it's a range of options. They have a good range of local and imported products. A must visit spot for all of you.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1609191747112, 'text': 'We love to hear that, Euna!

I love this place! The staff in this grocery shop are always pleasant and helpful. I'm not a regular shopper, but I can get some specialty products there at a very affordable price. I always find new things here to try, the staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable on most things, and the quality is good. Highly recommended!< /review>

The parking is great with the lot underneath the store. Great deli & meat section, but beakery & hot foods leave a lot to be desired. Friendly staff works hard & are very helpful.</text>

<text>Great variety of things , very clean, only complaint I have is the associate who helped us out at the register, she was very rude and snatched my ID when she asked for it. And then she tried to brush it off with a laugh. I don’t know what that was about but definitely not good customer service.<//text><UserId.>113052480635670830167<//UserId.>< rating>

Had amazing help from a super funny older guy in the deli and I was craving chicken salad. It's so good. Here's my sandwich I made from it.<//Text>

Years ago this was the local grocery store, and the place to buy your appliances. It has evolved into a beautiful gift shop.I can always find a quick gift or keep sake there. If you are new to town, or just visiting again, please stop in. You will enjoy it.<//Text>

I shop here regularly for my grocieries. I have probably have spent hundreds of dollars here over the years. I wouldn't recommend buying any alcohol from here. They don't allow you to return it regardless, if it is unopened and sealed and purchased in the same day. They couldn't articulate a policy for why they wouldn't take it back. I am not sure I am willing to purchase anything else from them based on their policies or lack of policies.< /text>

<response>None</response><Review>good store. Friendly store. I have shopped there for years. I KNOW the prices for many of the things I usually buy.

But when the virus hit, and I was shopping there, I noticed price increases on a few things I usually buy, Some up to a dollar more,

Shame on them for taking advantage of their loyal customers.< /Review><user>118231952467984400882<//user>< pictures>

Super convenient location, as we stayed at The Beach Cottages in pacific Beach. Relatively reasonable prices, compared to what I thought I'd run into. The staff were extremely helpful, and the staff and patrons were all friendly. We went (me and my 9 and 10 year old) at about dark, and I had no worries. Seemed clean and safe to me! We'll be going back tomorrow for some more groceries!< /text>

<Review>What a great grocery store.  When visiting the Mission Beach area I stumbled across the grocery store.  It had a great selection of everything I needed and even some things I didn’t know I wanted until I found them (those are the best, aren’t they?! ;)
One of the really nice features - if you tell the cash staff that you’re from out of town, they will still give you the Ralph’s Card discount.   It saved me over 50$ during my stay....and hey - there are lots of things to spend 50$ on at Mission Beach.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Mixed bag here: I currently have three torn legiments in my knee and Rosemary made my first grocery store visit amazing. Spotted me in the parking lot on crutches and brought me to the motorized cart. Saw me at the bathrooms and let me in and even found me at checkout to give me my crutches. She was fantastic.

The bad: her managers. I went over to compliment their staff and they both at first ignored me but then even worse went on to say it's just "because she needs the job" and continued to laugh and basically ignore and interrupt what I was saying.

If I wasn't immobile I would of lit these two up (just the disabled vet in me) but figured this might help. If you are in charge of these two (asst manager had slicked back hair, manager had some sort of skin birth defect) take them out that position. They are not positive and aren't helping anything.

Rosemary, deli workers, all fantastic and really made my first hurt grocery store visit a breeze. Other 2 "managers", jerks. Thanks for listening Ralph's .< /Review>< Pictures>

This isn’t the biggest Ralph’s out there but it has all the essentials you need. Can be quite busy at times with a decent wait at checkout out but nothing too crazy. The underground parking is super convenient when considering the prime location in the heart of PB.<//text>

I moved 15 minutes away from the PB area, and still drive back to this store for groceries. The Team there remember and engage me, and make it feel like a neighborhood kind of place. Which I appreciate.
I’d like to pay some recognition especially to Mike in the Deli. Mike is beyond knowledgable, lights up the place, and always takes time to chat and makes my day. Thanks very much to him, and your Team.< /text>

Flew into San Diego really late last night and we were looking for some essential to start our holiday although Your employee Lisa was closing the doors she saw our disappointment and asked us what we needed, when we told her we just needed some breakfast items she let us in with such grace and rung in our purchase with such a pleasant tone.  Lisa is a true testatement to wonderful customer service and empathy.  Well done Lisa we really appreciated your care and Ralph's is lucky to have you as their employee!<//review>

<Text>Too expensive, but you'll shop here anyways, as its really the only grocer for miles. Bring your own bags, they charge per plastic bag. The place is Smith's, they take Smith's rewards cards. Not sure why they changed the name, I just found it rather entertaining. Good experience, fun trip with my dad 😂<//Text></record>

I went at 645 am. You have to park underneath the store and walk up a ramp and an escalator to get to the front door. There were pallets and carts all over the place. Trucks blocking the side street. The only positive was the checker and she was nice and polite. Not well planned at all this location.</review>

Join the customer club, it's free and easy at the check out, it will be worth the effort. Parking is behind the store in a garage. Unusual entry and exit from the store. Other than that .. good store with good choices and prices (for the area)</text>

The overall experience at this market was good. No one greeted me or asked if I needed anything as other Ralph's stores do. I needed to visit the restroom while there and although it has a security code on the door to get in (I believe to prevent the use by customers only) it was disgustingly unattended because the toilet seat had dried feces on it. When I brought it to the attention of a worker she just continued to comment that they check the restroom periodically... I totally could have cared less... Just take care of it now was my thought... You don't want your customers to have to deal with that.</Review>

It's the same as Kroger, city market, king soopers, etc.  Not far from mission beach and Pacific beach. Plus underground parking do you don't have to find a street spot.< /review>< Rating>

<Text>I bought some fruit cups on Oct 31,2018. My husband ate two cups said taste nasty and threw away. I open one to try one sip the juice burns my tougue.  I started checking the expiration date. I found out that they were actually expired on 4/5/2018 and 8/5/2018.<//Text>< pictures>

Checking out with my 14 month old grandson... he was getting fussy. The the checker brought out a mini balloon on a stick, checked with Memaw to make sure it was okay, then played a quick peek-a-boo. Elliot forgot all about being fussy, and held the balloon all the way home.

Thank you dear checker... sorry I didn't get your name, 'cuz you deserve kudos! I'll have to find out. :)</text>

<response>None<//response><Text>Billed as an organic food store - this is a typical Krogers super market (Krogers is the largest chain in the US). This is a good grocery store but not a specialty market or someplace special for any reason. Location, location, location. I will try the Vons a couple of miles away next time I need a major grocery r in the area - otherwise some of the local markets will supply the produce that I need.< /Text><date>1515470946449</date><rating>3< /rating></record>

<review>I go to this Ralph's often ( I can walk to it, so it's very convenient.) They can be a bit pricy,  but if you go for their weekly specials and deals you can do pretty well!  I really like when they have their Progresso Soup on sale. I've seen stores list the soup up to $3.49 or more, per can, retail. Winter days and nights are great for having your favorite soup, complimented with your favorite grilled cheese, or even a good salad. It's comfort food that's good for you!  And if you're not familiar with they're  "clearanced" bakery goods, or  their manager's   "specials"   on seafood and/or meat in their Butcher's Dept. then please look for them in your neighborhood Ralph's. ( I am on a very small, budget, ( You could say I  am even below the poverty level with my SSI,)   So just know I really do hunt down those deals. They are at all kinds of stores, not just Ralph's.<//review>< Pics>

<time>1534311416236< /time><Rate>5<//Rate><text>(Translated by Google) Surprisingly well sorted, good prices with a customer card (you can easily get it with your first purchase)
Parking is in the basement, of course with an escalator! 😉
Easily accessible, open late. There isn't really an alternative in the immediate vicinity, the target is 15 minutes away. Still, the prices are really okay.

Überraschend gut sortiert, gute Preise mit Kundenkarte (bekommt man problemlos beim 1. Einkauf direkt mit dazu)
Parken ist im Untergeschoss, natürlich auch mit Rolltreppe hoch! 😉

(Translated by Google) In this store everyone is very kind. From the moment you enter until you leave the store. They helped me find what I needed, with a smile. And above all they accepted all the coupons that I had, despite the products being on sale. I definitely recommend this store !!

En esta tienda todos son muy amables . Desde que entras hasta que sales de la tienda. Me ayudaron a buscar lo que necesitaba,con una sonrisa. Y sobre todo me aceptaron todos los cupones que yo tenia, a pesar de estar los productos en sale.  Definitivamente recomiendo esta tienda!!</Text>

<text>Dr. Robert Chan MD fixed all my kidney stone issues via surgery.  Great bedside manners.  He takes the time to explain things.  He checks his email/myChart throughout the day and weekend and replies quickly.  If you have a kidney stone problem, Dr. Robert Chan MD is the person you need to see.<//text><UserId.>101309240128095805506</UserId.><Name>Jacob Sung< /Name><gmapID>0x864737269f16b38d:0xd6c2a6915ce5629f<//gmapID>< Pictures>

When I arrived for my appointment, I was immediately greeted and information was exchanged. I was taken to a procedure suite and my procedure started promptly and professionally. I could not compliment Dr Chan and his staff enough. I am very happy with my treatment.</Text>

I will always be thankful for Dr Chan’s herculean efforts in managing my care at the emergency room in June 2020. Instead of letting me walk out with a bottle of pills, his decision to perform an expedited procedure to put in a stent to drain the pathogens from my kidneys that day (after work, no less) enabled me to deal with the 9mm kidney stone stuck in my ureter without going into sepsis, as had happened with previous infections. How wonderful! The stone was later removed flawlessly via non-invasive surgery. I didn't even need a pain pill in the entire process from beginning to end. Superman doesn't have anything on him! What a great job! I am so grateful!<//text>

Dr. Chan is a wonderful doctor, he's patient and knowledgeable, he has a calming presence.
He took his time explaining everything. I would give him an extra STAR for being on time, that is so rare in his profession. I highly recommend him.</Review>

Dr. Chan was very patient in listening to all my concerns and answered all my questions.  I felt very comfortable with his recommendations.  Dr. Chan’s nurse was very professional and made me very comfortable during the exam.  Dr. Chan’s admitting staff were also professional, friendly, and eager to assist me with any questions that I had.  I highly recommend Dr. Chan & his staff in their Kingwood office.<//review>

Dr. Robert Chan is an excellent physician and surgeon. The staff at Northwoods Urology is also very kind and helpful. They helped me through the process of getting diagnosed and answering all the questions I had before having surgery. Dr. Chan will be sorely missed, but if ever in need I would go back to this practice.</Review>

Dr. Robert Chan was extremely gracious and thorough. He showed us a video of robotic surgery and referred me to Dr. R. James Lu to do my surgery. The staff were helpful and made me feel comfortable. I will need to go back to do a preop with Dr. Lu and will go from there.< /text>

Dr. Chan was a great listener and actually cared when I was describing my problems.  He didn’t rush me and made sure I understood everything he was telling me.  When I asked how long it would take to have a procedure done thinking he would say 2-3 weeks he replied let’s do it now.  The procedure went perfect and he made sure I was pain free.<//review>

Super friendly, great with the animals. Lots of awesome suggestions for pet care. Nice discussion on benefits of pet insurance and the VCA Care Club. Prices were very affordable.</review>

< review>
Kristen B, is the best. Takes care of all my kitties needs. Super friendly staff. More importantly ask for Kristen. This place is not noisy like those cheap places that get your ears ringing and your cats infested with fleas. Well worth the visit. No time wasted. Thanks Kristen and staff for making my life and my kitties life's easier and more peaceful.<//review>

I can't say enough good things about the staff and vets here. Since day one, we've been treated with kindness and understanding. They feel like a small operation even though they have a big name behind them. They are always quick to answer my questions over the phone, and no problem with my pups is too small for them to tend to. Incredible people!</Review>

Our animals are our top priority and Airport Irvine Animal Hospital has been absolutely wonderful through thick and thin.  All the vets are top notch as well as the techs and office staff.  We have been using them for 20+ years and highly recommend them to all my friends!

Four years ago, I posted these comments about Airport Irvine Animal Hospital and still feel 100% that this is my best and only choice for my animals.  Have great confidence in the vets and their staff.  Thank you.<//review>

I have been going here for years and through many pets. Always excellent and caring - helped when we had to put our cat down. Front desk always helpful and friendly. Technicians go a great job- had them trim nails on a very LIVELY Siamese and it went well. All the doctors have been professional, knowledgeable and not greedy like some other vets I had seen. Caring.<//Text>

My experience with meeting most of the vets there has been very good. I will miss Dr. Haley very much. She took care of my three cats for years and now there is only one left. I know she will be happy in her new home and wish her the best. I do know that my cat Rocky will still be getting the best care that I can find. It took a lot of tries to find this wonderful place but I am glad I did. The staff is always helpful and kind.<//Review>

Wonderful, caring vets and staff. Dr. Radovich was recommended to my daughter through someone associated with Pugs n Pals. He is knowledgeable and his love for animals shows.

The entire staff is always professional and eager to help. I like everyone who works there. We lost our wonderful pug a few months ago and they were so compassionate and supportive to us. I have no doubt this is the best vet in the area. I would recommend Airport Irvine Animal Hospital to anyone who wants the best for their pets.</Review>

< review>
My dog was hit by a car and a loyal client to Airport Irvine found him and brought him to the hospital where they scanned him and found his microchip. Where I was than notified. We would have never found him if I didn't have the microchip. I thought with all that had happened it would be an outrageous bill. But it was so reasonable and honest and they took amazing care of my dog. I have been a client ever since. The Dr. are the best, they know you by name even when you just pop in to pick something up. They never run unnecessary test and run you around. You can call and ask the Dr. a quick silly question. Its like family there. It makes you feel good that the animals you love are just as loved by the vets and staff they see at Airport Irvine Animal Hospital.< /review>

Airport Irvine Animal Hospital has provided 7 years of exceptional treatment for my Husky/Malamute mix.  Dr. Radovich is extremely knowledgeable and thorough.  He has always provided us with all the options regarding any malady and has a caring attitude and a gentle demeanor.  He always  makes himself available for advice and consultation via telephone or in person.  I would unconditionally recommend his services to any pet owner.<//review>

We moved away from Orange county for a year but we drove over an hour to bring our pugs to AIAH.  We are back now and are happy to be close to this facility again. The support staff and doctors are knowledgeable, supportive, friendly, and compassionate.  The prices seem reasonable (even though we don't think much about price when our little ones are sick). It is so reassuring to have such great people close by.</review>

<Text>I *LOVE* this clinic! The staff is very friendly, very knowledgeable, patient, caring, and sensitive to both the needs of our dog and our concerns as owners.  I've never left this office frustrated, confused, or felt like I (read: my wallet) was being taken advantage of.  No unnecessary tests or procedures, and all treatment options are discussed in detail and take into consideration the current state of health of my pet, what we can afford, and what we know we can or can't follow through with at home.  I also love how everyone knows us as we walk through the door or call to set up an appointment (and Dr. Coston, our primary vet, saw me outside the office and inquired about how my dog was doing and remembered everything about her!) -- they feel like family.  I HIGHLY recommend this practice to anyone looking for a vet in the area.  You won't be sorry!</Text>< name>

Dr. Renahan has been my Pugs vet for over 12 years now and I would not even think of having it any other way , she is knowledgeable , caring and is excellent at finding solutions to help my dogs live a comfortable life, because of her my 1st Pug  lived 3 -4 years longer because of her ability to diagnose and correctly treat a condition ,  and she always tells it like it is ... the technicians and front office staff are always caring and helpful , which always makes for a pleasant experience , for me it is comforting to know that I can take my dogs there and know that they are well cared for,  there is absolutely no reason to bring your pet  anywhere else ..</Text>

<Text>The team at AIAH is the best!  I have a very NERVOUS dog, who is scared of everyone...they are always so kind to him.  I have so much less stress knowing that they remember him and still greet him like everyone else, regardless of his fears.

Thank you!</Text><time>1441151164873< /time>< pics>

First it Elvis' knee surgery & care. He lived a long, active life. His passing was treated with such dignity and compassion.My husband and I were touched. Clyde was a great dog, as well, and they cared for him, too. Currently, our baby-dog Callie just loves going to her vet! Her tail spins in circles when we turn down Bristol and she knows where she is going! We fully trust them with her health. Dr. Renehan has experience with tortoises and takes great care of our Rosie.

Love Airport Irvine Animal Hospital. Love all the Vets, but my favorite is Dr. Radovich. He is the best Vet we have ever had. We are on our 2nd set of Maltese, so we have been through check-ups through surgeries, and also losses. So far, all have been from old age. Doc managed to keep one of our dogs to the age of
18 1/2, and I attribute it that to great diagnosis time after time, and proper treatments. Highly recommend AIAH!!< /text>

<review>We've been going here for about 6+ years and have received services for everything from pet urgent care to nail clipping.  Prices have been fair - not the cheapest I've seen, but we get a good value thanks to their thorough and consistent service.  I never feel like I'm being oversold or told I have to purchase certain products or services.  My appointments are usually quick and painless and we're in and out for exactly what we came for.  I appreciate that my vet has worked with me when it came to some of my more specific requests (ie. I went in not wanting to over-vaccinate my dog, so she suggested testing levels for certain vaccines before deciding to proceed with the usual vaccine update schedule for some of the optional vaccines.)

They offer Saturday morning appointments which is great for us full time working folk, and I love the new option for online scheduling of appointments.  Sometimes I remember that our dog needs an appointment at 2 in the morning, but will forget to call in to make the appointment the next day - with the online scheduling, I can request my appointment time at 2AM and get a confirmation later that day. Very convenient!</review>< Pictures>

We have been taking all of our pets to Airport Irvine Animal Hospital for almost 25 years.  They have always been caring, professional, friendly, helpful and treat the animals in a common sense manner.  Dr. Radovich, Dr. Renehan, and the rst of the staff are all wonderful.

Also have a neighbor that moved out of the area and she drives from Huntington Beach and the Big Bear area just to bring her animals to the vet she knows and trusts.

If you read some of the other reviews, people talk about going to this animal hospital for many years.  That says a lot to me!

You won't be sorry.<//text>

<Text>We have been taking our pets to Airport Irvine Animal Hospital for many years.  Drs. Radovich and Renahan were the first doctors our boys saw.  Now our boy sees Dr. Haley.  The staff is very friendly and extremely kind to the pets.  We had 4 boys and have now lost them over the past few years however have adopted a new boy and had him for about 7-8 years....you could tell he had been mistreated until we got him and the staff is extremely patient and so loving towards him when we have had to board him he doesn't react badly - he seems to enjoy his stays.  We would not take our boy anywhere else.  We would highly recommend Airport Irvine Animal Hospital to anyone.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dcdf0446f59993:0x2a31aca85b7efb32< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>i had them as my vet for my loving dogs for over 25 years.since then i have moved out of california. they are the best of the best vets for your animals. i can not say enough about them but since i left california i really miss them for my animals.one of my dogs they saved her life over chewing gum..one of the ingredients in gum is zylatol.  it is a sweetner they put in many different products. back in the days it was just coming out as a threat to animals. i did not hear about it but my one dog got into gum as she had before. i called the vet just to be sure as she chewed a few sticks. more than usual..they asked me to bring her in just to check her out. well had i not takin her to them she would have died with in hours. they kept me calm til  i got her there so i wouldn't have an accident on the way and then rushed her to the back.. then told me about this awful  awful danger of this zylatol.. she was basically one of their first experiences that had eaten this. i will forever be grateful to them for saving my mocha's life. don't ever doubt as they are the best in the world and so loving and caring for our wonderful animals..i will always be grateful to them..</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I first came in to see you in July, 2003 with a small 4 week orange male tabby (Bailey) that my son brought over to my condo with his eye totally infected.  He found this kitten in a dumpster.  You took care of him, giving him the proper shots and eye medication and antibiotics and informed me after a few visits that he would be blind in his one eye and it would eventually have to be removed.  You were his vet until two years later when I moved to Dana Point.  However, when Bailey seemed to have an ear infection I took him to another vet in Laguna Beach (Dr. Susan Davis - BIG MISTAKE) instead of taking him to Dr. Craft (who you recommended)-  her associate vet gave him an antibiotic shot along with a booster shot at the same time. Costing me $$$$.   One day later he would not eat, would not drink, did not use his litter box and was hiding and acting spastic - – long story short took him to an emergency veterinarian hospital in Mission Viejo at 10 pm where they re-hydrated him with IV fluids because he had a fever exceeding 108 and kept him overnight for $900.  I picked him up the next morning (Friday) and returned to the vet in Laguna Beach where she said she couldn't help him and referred me to a "specialist" that would charge $1200 to walk in the door.  I called you at 4:45 pm that day and you said to bring in Bailey and you would wait for him – because of traffic I didn't arrive at your office until after 6 pm on a Friday night.  You knew exactly what was wrong with him, stating giving a booster shot AND an antibiotic shot at the same time should never be done.  You gave him a cortisone shot and told me to bring him back in the morning.  He was 50% better that night and by the next day was 90% better and by the end of the week was doing just fine.  Since that time I recommended you to all my friends at church, at work and all my family.  I wish I could find another vet like you here in Arizona – they just don't meet up to my standards because of you.  Bailey is now 12 and an indoor car living in a wonderful home and healthy!
Five years ago I brought in Bailey and my son's cat, "Cow" to get shots and an overall certificate since we were going on a month long car trip to New York.  Again, you and your staff ARE THE BEST.  Your staff helped with ideas to keep the cats' safe and calm which worked – they were in cat carriers in the car 6-7 hours a day for a month and they were calm and happy.
Since that time I have called you and you have returned my call on a concern I had about my son's 17 year old cat ("Cow") that had developed a thyroid condition.  Again, you helped and even told me that the special diabetic food "cannot" be mixed with other food which is something the vet here in Arizona never told us.
Then again I gave your name to my friend, Lisa Leibovici who is a dear, dear friend dealing with a cancer/tumor ridden Rottweiler.  You returned her call and gave her so much information.  She informed me what you had said and was so grateful and thankful to you for your helping her understand more about Rottweilers and her situation – something her own vet didn't do.  She is now going to recommend you to all her friends and family.
THANK YOU DR. RENEHAN – YOU ARE TRULY BLESSED BY GOD AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I TOTALLY BELIEVE YOU ARE THE BEST VET EVER!!!!!<//review>

<Review>I have been going to Airport Irvine Animal Hospital for almost 17 years.  Dr. Radovich (and on occasion Dr. Renahan) has cared for all of my dogs and I wouldn't take them anywhere else. Both doctors are honest and practical and have helped me through difficult decisions about their care.  We've been through cancer with one dog and a TPLO surgery with another and doctor Radovich readily discussed all of the options for treatment, specialists etc. with me so I had a clear understanding of what to expect. They have always been available to answer my questions and I have never felt rushed through an appointment nor have I ever felt pushed to do any procedure over and above what was needed.  The techs are friendly and competent - very kind to my animals. The front desk can get a little crazy at times but the staff does a great job keeping it in check.< /Review></record>

I have been going to Airport Irvine Animal Hospital for over 33 yrs. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Vets and staff.  I have used most of the Drs. that work there, but primarily use Dr. Renehan, Dr. Costo and Dr. Radovich. Extremely knowledgeable Doctors, vey caring.  I also do Dog rescue, so I take many dogs there to be cared for plus my own.
The staff is wonderful, from front office to the Techs. Every one is warm and caring and take such wonderful care of my pets. I bring dogs with issue that bring a lot of challenges to the Drs., but they never give up, always trying to find answers and solutions. Love that they think ourside the box, as in my rescue world and dealing with Pugs it is essential.

I highly, highly recommed Airport Irvine Animal hospital to every one and do often<//Text>

Well, I was sent an email from this hospital that asked for a review of their service.  I was always told if you can't say something nice, don't say anything, but in this case, I will..........My Great Dane is 4 1/2 year old now, and I started with Dr. Radovich as his first Vet.  He was referred to me by friends and highly recommended.  He was the Dr. in my dog's early years, but during the course of visits I began to get other Dr's and eventually it felt like I was at Kaiser, because I never knew who would see my Dane.  I still feel like Dr. Radovich is one of the best Vets in the Valley but during an emergency visit last year, he declined to take my Dog because he was busy with regular appts, and my dog needed emergency surgery to save his life.  The vet who did the procedure was one I had not met.....I spoke with "her" on the phone prior to surgery and she assured me that Dr. Radovich would be close by but that she would be doing the surgery.  I asked her how many procedures of this nature she had done, and her answer was "a few".  I was in route home from Hawaii to be with my dog, so to make a long story shorter, a grave mistake in post op, caused my dog to endure yet a second surgery.........the Vet was reluctant to take responsibility at first, but did with evidence from an emergency facility that took care of my dog after surgery.  My vet didn't provide 24hr service beyond the original surgery.  The whole ordeal was very difficult to deal with and I never got a formal apology from this Animal Hospital.  It's not the place to take a large dog, as the operatorys are small, not a comfortable fit for the size of a Dane.  After I googled the Vet who did my surgery, I found out she specialized in Feline/Cats, and I was in disbelief that Dr. Radovich would let my Dane be a learning dog.  I was not happy with the way this whole ordeal was handled.<//text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>(Translated by Google) Hello, I went today to give my dog ​​kachys her vaccinations because they had recommended that place to me when they gave it to my dog. I wanted to ask the lady who gave it to me when she had the next vaccinations and another question but she answered “I just I am the one who does the cleaning and wash the bathrooms, here I don't know anything ”I am disrespectful so my person that someone not professional in the service area of ​​what a veterinarian is will send my little animal that is not good service it was A bad experience since I paid for a service they did not do it for free to have done that.

(Original)
Hola fui hoy a ponerle sus vacunas a mi perrita kachys pues me habían recomendado ese lugar cuando me la entregaron a mi perrita quise preguntarle a la señora que me la entregó que cuando le tocaban la próximas vacunas y otra pregunta pero ella me contesto “ yo solo soy la que hago la limpieza y lavo los baños aquí no se nada” se me hace una falta de respeto así mi persona que alguien no profesional en el área del servicio de lo que es una veterinaria mandarán a mi animalito eso no es buen servicio fue una mala experiencia puesto que yo pague por un servicio no me lo hicieron de a gratis como para haber hecho eso.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Good place. After all the Hollywood commotion and homeless on the floors you walk into this place and feel completely in a different place. It's a bit pricey but the place and the energy and the people make it worth while. Ordered some peppers and edamame. And with some rolls. The corn crunch roll was the best.

Oh and the creepy faces in the mirrors of the men's room.<//Review>

There are very fresh and well prepared shrimp and fish recipes. They have a strong cocktail range, too. It's a perfect restaurant for brunch, and dinner in particular. The food was fine, and I have to admit that the cake was the ideal finish to a lovely evening. This restaurant is certainly recommended!<//Review>

The food is exceptional and almost perfectly cooked. The workers are equally hospitable and admire the kind of work they do. This restaurant is a very good choice for fine dining. The interior design of the restaurant for a couple's dates, family holidays, or business meetings would create a comfortable and romantic atmosphere.< /Text>

Delicious! Servers are amazing and super attentive. Bussers are on it as soon as you're done with a plate, they come around to take it away. Best service ever. Atmosphere is incredible.</text>

As the location becomes very complete from 6 pm, I would suggest making a reservation ahead of time. The food is just delicious and not too expensive, and the staff are so nice. If you're there as a family, a group of friends or a special night with your girlfriend, this is a great restaurant.</Review>< Pictures>

They have great sushi including famous specials priced and surprised by Chef selections of Sushi and Sashimi just get invented and sliced prepared by famous Chefs just at the time of order The singn on Hollywood blvd is Boarded by Large billboards Ads. Other locations of different brands of businesses. Also it's contributed as an open for business selection . I called no answer seems disconnected most probably closed permanently. For long time even before Virus striking L. A . This place had an illusion of being open. Probably might be for location and filming. So I can guarantee it but I would not prepare for evening visit to this Restaurant what's so ever. Katsuya carries other locations too.    RZED</Text>< Gmap_id>

This place is a must when in Sanfran
They were out of the oysters I wanted to try. But it was later in thwhen we went. We waited in line for like 10 mins had a spot open on the bar. If you have a small group ask for the bar you can watch them prepare dishes. It was very clean place the staff was great. Water and bread refills Every few mins. The staff made us feel welcomed like we were old buddy's</review>

I always have fun here
It's a little like being in the Matrix
A but surreal
The food is always good
The drinks are strong
The music is usually pretty good
The service is good at tables
The bar service is not as good...

Quality of the ingredients is good
The presentation is well done
The staff is best at a table

Its a little sceney a little Hollywood
Not the place you go if you don't want people staring at you

I like it and will return
Improvements

Just the waiting area and bar could be a bit better run...

We had reservations and waited 30 moments and the barf tender seemed too busy to be bothered but it's Hollywood...

Not bad for LA< /Review>

Right around the corner from the Pantages so we only had to park once for dinner and the show. The food here is out of this world. I had the salmon lemon sushi. It was a good sized portion and so yum!</Text>

You don’t come to Hollywood without experience sushi at Katsuya.  The Social Media 55 team is in love with every dish on your menu.   Thank you for the hospitality and superb service.

Miss the great service, awesome drinks and mouth watering recipes.  Can’t wait to return and I will miss the warm rhyming welcome at the door when we arrive.  Thank you for the great times and looking forward to seeing you all soon.< /review>

Have to come try this place out when you're in the area! Best simple hand rolls! Order as set menu based on how many rolls you can consume. Always add more as you eat.</Review>

Went for happy hour. Don't expect  Much of a scene. But the sake is $5 the sushi is amazing. If you just wanna have a drink and some good food for a really good price it's a great place to go for happy hour</review>

<Text>I really wasnt pleased with the service levels also not giving customers options for something as simple as a straw I am aware we are in California... but I find that is interesting how so much emphasis we put on one particular thing and not emphasis on others we have a homeless issue currently and we're worried about straws... they could have offered paper straws would have been better... And the way that the server by the name of Christopher reacted to my question was are arrogant and non helpful and want me to just understand that this is California but forgetting the fact that I'm a customer and I asked for that simple thing... What happened to good Old customer service California so over rated<//Text>< pictures>

< Review>
Grabbed a quick bite here for dinner during the happy hour. They've got decent specials during happy hour but the freshness of the sushi makes this place worth the visit. Their Otoro and Salmon was phenomenal but the Uni was just okay. Can be a little pricey for the average sushi goer, but worth it.<//Review>

Idk, maybe I just need to try something besides just the sashimi special, but fish quality felt mediocre. Was underwhelmed given the reputation. Not bad but just mediocre< /text>

Top level sushi place with an expensive price tag, But worth it. Their sushi is simply out of this world, Don't know how they prepare it to be so delicious but it seems like you just can't get enough from literally their entire menu. Everything we ordered was just mind blowing good.</Review>

<text>I really enjoyed the chicken shawarma plate with two sides. The dolmas were okay, hummus was delish, garlic sauce was tasty, and the tzatziki was decent. I enjoyed the look of the space. They have an outdoor patio for dining available. The workers are very nice. Definitely coming back.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2bf391265d04f:0x61a13f0966697b2c</GmapID>< rating>

The intimate, Philippe Stack designed, Katsuya Hollywood is complex, expensive, and brilliantly eclectic.  The Sushi Chefs bring the confident skill that compliments the modern artistic environment. Their sashimi plate is gorgeous.

The large reception area is decorated in a geometric pattern of twelve, three foot (1m) tall, twelve inchs (30 cm) square solid, under-lit, clear plastic resin columns, embedded with white knives. It is a homage to the tool of the sushi chef.

Shannon, our hostess, led us to one of two dinning rooms. The dining area, hidden behind a curtain.  Parting the curtain you enter a darkened dining room, that has just enough soft lighting for a romantic effect. The large wall facing us is covered with a giant photo of a brightly lit, seductive woman's eyes. She is always watching.

Katsuya was awarded "Travel and Leisure's" award for best design. The chairs are oversized and well padded. The tables are large enough to be comfortable. As the room fills it can be difficult to hear your companion.

Yes, Katsuya is wheelchair accessible. However it not easy. Here's how it's done. First, one of your party steps up the entrance stairway and let's the reception desk know a guest in a wheelchair ( or handicap) requires access. You and the disabled guest travel North to Hollywood Boulevard, turn West (left) and move past the "Pie Hole Restaurant" to a small unmarked door. Here you will be greated and taken into Katsuya. It is worth the effort.

Kyle, our server, is knowledgeable and friendly. We were presented with two menus, conventional and vegan. The conventional menu is extensive. The
vegan menu is two-thirds shorter. We ordered from the vegan menu.

Our meal, consisting of vegan appetizers: vegetable sushi, crispy rice and avocado, and crispy, shaved brussel sprouts. Each was prepared with care and artistry. Katsuya has four kitchens.

Parking is difficult and expensive.</review>

Consistency, efficiency, and quality are some of the words which come to mind when I think of Katsuya Hollywood. As a frequent visitor, Katsuya Hollywoodnever disappoints. They have packages, similar to Sugarfish with their Trust Me variations. They have a three, four, and five handroll option, or you are able to order a la carte. Quick and swift!</text>

This place has amazing sushi. And the ambiance is good too.
It would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the valet, they drive the cars with no care and reverse in the middle of the street, with on coming traffic. That needs to change.< /text>

I want to give 3.5 stars.
On LA week, I ordered dinner menu. It costs 49 dollars each. My best menu is fried rice with spicy tuna. My worst menu is wagyu fried rice. It is very salty and watery. It feels me overpriced.<//Review>

<review>really tasty food, nice atmosphere. Where do you have a sushi restaurant with a DJ?!
Only $20 for 5 pieces of gyoza is a lot of money. That makes me give 4 starts. The $20, that is excluding tax and tip, so add another 25%, making it $25...< /review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Forgot to take pictures because we kept getting sidetracked by atmosphere, cocktails and delicious food. We've been a few times now and it's always great. The chef special Tuna Crispy Rice is the best thing on the menu, but everything else is not far behind. The menu is creative and interesting but still grounded in Japanese style. It's not all sushi, they've got great mains and sides as well. Do make a reservation to save yourself a wait.</Review>< pictures>

But....the food is kind of a joke. Bland and lakes creative flavor. I would say this is more like buying grocery store sushi and eating it in a cool club. We tried a number of things mostly 4-piece sushi rolls for $18 and we just were underwhelmed with them all.
Service staff was nice and on top of it, bartender was pretty much rude.
We will not be returning...Too many other great places to enjoy.<//Text>< Pictures>

This elevated dining experience really made my night. I came into town to visit the IT carnival, ended up eating here and getting there "IT 2" special. They really knew how to make an extroidinarily memorable experience. Adding that curtain between the dining area and the entrance really made me feel like I was a special guest. We didn't experience any wait for our seats and were taken care of very well. The guests next to us were not so lucky.. they were given a dirty glass with something "floating in it". They had asked 3 times before it was removed and replaced. And at the very end of our experience something in my friends glass caught my eye.. there was a gnat floating in his glass too.. but all of that aside, they handled it very well and really went out of their way to accommodate us.
Also the server didn't ask for my ID before offering me a glass of alcohol.. and I'm not 21.. and neither did the bartender or the manager behind the bar.
I did spot gnats hovering over the fruit at bar.
Hopefully if you try Katsuya Hollywood you won't float too..< /Text>

Came from the East coast for my bday with friends. Actual quotes during dinner:"I've reached Euphoria", "I'll fly back to LA just for this meal". But seriously it's so good. The rock shrimp roll and the short rib app are a must!
Service was amazing as well (we had Crystal)! Recommend. 5/5!</text>

Every dish was freshly prepared, and came out timely. Drinks were solid. The food here is pretty pricey, though some may say it's worth the price. We were a bigger party but had the tiniest of tables. Somewhat comical when orders arrived and there was no where to put the dishes. Would go back for a celebration, but not for a casual bite to eat.</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf391265d04f:0x61a13f0966697b2c</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It doesn't get more LA than Hollywood and Vine and Katsuya does sushi perfect. I recommend the Omakase. Never have I disliked what was ordered.< /text>

The food here is always enjoyable. I always get the Brussels sprouts.  They are nice and crispy with a delicious sauce.  The salmon lemon roll is really good.  They make a really good watermelon martini.</review>

I have never felt more discriminated against in my life. We waited an hour and a half to be seated as we saw other parties arrive after us and get seated before us. Once seated our waitress was no where to be found.  It took about 20 minutes for our order to be taken and once served no one checked on us. While I noticed the treatment she had for all her other guests. For the price and and all the hype it is not worth it.  I felt racist vibe. I will never go back here.</Review>

Great food and great service! I came in with my husband without a reservation before the Pantages Theatre. The manager Saba really helped me out and made sure we made it to the show on time. She was so kind and accommodating- something you always see these days!

Food was delish- don’t miss out on the Crispy Rice!!</review>

<review>Great place in Hollywood. Pretty convenient location and I must say, great sushi too! The service is great (as you'd expect in Hollywood) and they have an OK bar to wait at first too. We had a selection of food ranging from sashimi, sushi to steak. Each dish came out fresh and fast. Would certainly go back. Not exactly the cheapest place but then again for this quality don't expect yo sushi prices! The only reason it doesn't get 5*s is that I think it's a bit cheesy when they announce everyone that walks in the room.<//review><Name>Matt Dixon<//Name>< Rate>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>This night was really kind of a letdown. For a sushi place right on Hollywood Blvd. I expected more. I expected to be wowed. The food was okay, but not great. Our server looked nice, but she barely paid attention to us. A few times, she walked away from the table when we were in the middle of speaking to her. She didn’t refill our drinks until I got up, walked over to her & asked for refills. We went through most of our meal with no drinks. The room was very cramped & uncomfortable. The bathrooms are weird and kind of terrifying. I was really unimpressed with the whole experience.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Text>I made a last minute reservation with open table which was great because there was a line when we got there.
The music was a little too loud to have easy conversation but the artwork and ambiance was otherwise great. I ordered the stuffed chicken.. don't remember the name but it was flattened and rolled sushi roll style. Cool presentation, but a little dry. Extensive wine selection.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c2bf391265d04f:0x61a13f0966697b2c</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Took a large party to Katsuya. The food is very delicious - especially the super soft steak, the seaweed salad, and the salmon. The drinks are well created also. The whole meal inclusive for 8 people was about $750, so you should expect to spend $70-$90/head.

One issue with the venue was the understaffing. The food came out very quickly and sporadically; however, there was one lady taking care of half the restaurant. It's not her fault at all, but she was assigned to 10+ tables, which included 50+ people. As a result, you get your drinks slowly, refills slower, and the experience is shot.

For over $100 gratuity, I'd expect a bit faster service. Again, this is no fault of the waitress as she hauled ass, but the restaurant needs to increase their staff, especially during dinner rushes prior to shows.

I'll go again at some point as I really like the food, but will refrain from hosting a client event here.< /Review>

First of all let me say that the food was very good, 5 stars to shef and his team.
Service: overall you can see the staff is trained but it felt insincere and robotic
Atmosphere: Management, PLEASE replace the leatherette chairs and booth, after years of use they soaked in sweat and produce terrible smell. We thought it was a case for particular table and asked to change tables, but it was the same smell comming from the booth.</text>

The fish & octopus were very fresh, nice cut and presented on the dish. The decor is very very nice and romantic. The decor gave us a soothing and relaxation when we dined at this restaurant. Made us feel upscale and high class inside Hollywood area. Our waiter was super nice to us, greeted and serviced us with respect " yes sir, no sir, thank you sir, etc.." This is a perfect place for couple who are dating or married. The price is very reasonable at the Hollywood area. I'm kinda disappointed to the Long Island icea tea that I ordered. I did not tast much alcohol to it for the price of $16. I had to order another one and this time advised my waiter to make it double shot of liquor. That's why I gave this place 4-star.<//review>< Pictures>

Some of the best sushi I've ever had. Super high quality. One Interesting thing about the sashimi is the fish being served only slightly cool. Normally you expect the fish being stored really cold. The slightly cool temperature allows so much more flavor to come through and leads to a greater enjoyment. And since the quality is so high, I have never gotten sick from bad fish. Highly recommend</Review>

I'll give two stars just because the food was ok, but the service was terrible. We waited for the server first, then he forgot to order us 2 courses, and it was just two of us! They were bringing the courses to the table for 20min. We kept reminding him what we have ordered, cause we weren't getting it! It could have been much much better...<//review>

Every single server I interacted with was friendly, professional, and so on top of it. The DJ was really good which was funny because I never care for music at a restuarant.

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Great sushi and great wagyu steak. We were disappointed of the amount of food in the tasting menu. We had to order extra rolls to be completely happy. Minus one star for that. Regardless of this its very nice food here, worth a visit!</Text>< Pictures>

I was here last night. Best sushi in Hollywood. I love the decor, very chic and a little retro. Very cool place. The food and services were excellent. Thumbs up. I will be coming back. The people that come here to dine are awesome,  friendly, and outgoing. If you want privacy or have a large group, they have an area for that.</text>

<Text>Being from Japan, the tempura was not light and fluffy, the A1 fried rice was really greasy, the pork belly was dry, and their special katsuya roll that too many wraps of cucumber that it actually overpowered all the other flavors and no seaweed. Everything was overpriced for a Japanese cuisine experience. The only thing good at the place was our chocolate dessert, sake, and our waiter Brace.</Text>< pictures>

This is a great pre-Pantages show dinner, drinks, snacks option. No need to get a table (unless you want to) the bar has full service and a great happy hour (at the bar 5pm - 7pm).

The happy hour menu may be small but there is a solid variety: rolls, nigiri, cocktails, and small plates. Everything is under $10 so if you have a small group you can have a great meal/snack for only part of the cost.

Since it is literally down the street from the Pantages Theatre it is a perfect pre-show option.

They do have valet for $14 and they will let you leave your car with valet while you enjoy a Pantages show!< /Text>

This is the best of the Katsuya locations. Please note that the prices seem a bit higher than the other Valley locations. Regardless, the sushi is so fresh and worth every penny. Try their roasted eggplant dish for starters. You will not be disappointed with this meal.<//text>

My friends and I wanted a sushi treat so we decided to hit up this well-known Hollywood establishment.  It did not disappoint. Great ambiance and we loved sitting next to the sushi chefs and watching them do their thang.  The food was impeccable.  We ordered a smorgasbord of cuisine and it was all amazing.  We paired our food with cocktails that were equally delectable.</Text>

OMGoodness... this place is AMAZING!! My husband and I used to live in LA and it's places like these that we miss the most. We went for a date night when visiting and weren't disappointed. The sushi was amazing, of course, but the Wagyu beef... I can't even describe the out-of-control flavor, presentation, and overall deliciousness. Just get it, splurge!</Review>

<time>1540141625557<//time><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>For such an expensive restaurant I honestly expected better than a mediocre place . My steak at $42 dollars. It was horrible, small, overcooked , and seasoned horribly I can get a better steak at sizzler or anywhere really. My wife's lobster did not taste right and she was very disappointed in it. The only redeeming quality about the place was some of there wait staff some like ours were very friendly while others had a stuck up feeling and would get irritated if we asked them for anything. Overall that was 152 dollars that I honestly wish I could have spent at somewhere else that I could have actually enjoyed . I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1543879187168, 'text': "We know you have many options when choosing to dine out, which is why it is so unfortunate to hear that we did not meet your expectations.

The worst service from our server. It was a very bad experience from what should be a good restaurant. The manager was fake in her apology with attitude and sarcasm.</Review>

<review>This place is indeed one of the best places in LA or the Hollywood area if you want to get technical. There is absolutely no self parking you'll be lucky to ever find a parking spot on the street but they have valet parking now the food is really amazing. You will definitely feel satisfied and be glad that you took the decision of dining here don't be surprised if you run into any celebrity while eating in there. I seen Taylor Swift twice now the portions are not that big but they do makeup for it and taste. Only negative thing I have to say is that they serve Foe gras which I am absolutely against it's terrible. Yes it is pricey but this isn't just any sushi spot. You'll love it.

Although we try to control what happens on our property, we cannot forcibly remove anyone that is standing on the public sidewalk in front of our restaurant. We are known for offering authentic Japanese cuisine, and Poke is not traditionally a Japanese dish, however we do have a chirashi  lunch special during our lunch hours, and other very similar items during dinner. In regards to the welcome greeting you mention, this is another Japanese tradition for welcoming guests into the restaurant. In order to avoid hearing this on future visits, we would recommend sitting in the Dragon room side of the restaurant, which is more intimate and the greeting does not take place. We appreciate you taking the time to share your helpful feedback, and hope to have the chance to serve you again in the near future. Thank you."}<//Resp><Date>1543631473227<//Date>< Review>
Came in, waited longer than I should have, given there was no one in the restaurant.  There was a homeless lady right out side the door taking a poo, the host all gathered around talking about it, till one of them went outside to ask her to leave. Once sat, kept hearing the host and cooks yell out something in Japanese every single time they came in to seat a table, got annoying after a while. The menu is limited, no poke or chirashi bowl.  Our waiter Kristian was super nice and friendly, we ordered chicken teriyaki and a California roll.  The chicken was outstanding in flavor but a small portion given the price.  The California roll was gross, didn't realize someone can mess up a California roll.  We ordered chocolate cake for dessert it was delicious, but again really small portion.   Not worth the price in my opinion, wish I would have went to a more divey sushi place.< /Review>

<text>Great sushi rolls, the spicy tuna crispy rice roll is amazing; its just basically a little bit of sticky rice that is slightly seared with the tuna on top. Also you can try their appetizers which are amazing, there is a kobe meatball which is great. Overall great food.</text>< rating>

Love an occasional melt down with some awesome sushis.
Katsuya was recommended.
However 45 minutes to get food. Completely abandoned by our waiter for refills and any other attention. Now I have to think twice to come here again...</Review>

<Text>Had an amazing Sunday night at Katsuya! My second time at the chain, but first at that location. I stuck with some of my choices from my first katsuya experience, but branched out as well. The Miso Glazed Black Cod was amazing, as usual; My favorite meal whenever it's offered on a menu.  The baked crab hand roll was tender and delicious as well! For our new choices, the truffle ponzu ceviche had amazing flavor and a plethora of fish choices. Finally, we went with the rock shrimp tempura roll. A lot of tasty shrimp on top for perfection! It was the perfect amount of spicy for a non-spicy lover like myself.
Service was also good! Always attended to.

All in all, I would definitely make a trip to katsuya. And if you have the budget splurge on the hot and cold courses. The rolls are delicious, but you can get specialty rolls at almost Japanese sushi places!</Text><userid>111510771506868899617< /userid></record>

When we were leaving the waiter ran out to the street as we were getting in a uber to complain about the tip. When we came back into the restaurant he began shouting at us and it almost turned into a physical fight. The manager apologized but still charged us for the meal. A complete nightmare.<//Text>

We always call into Philippes on the way to a Dodgers game or if we are in LA. the floor is covered in sawdust, a throwback to times gone by. the food is great and the atmosphere even better. you can sit down on a bench with fellow dodger fans or find a small corner. You will not be disappointed</review>

<Review>This used to be a very glamorous place to go to a few years ago, but the crowds have luckily died down a bit. On the expensive side, but certain dishes can be very tasty. I forgot the names, but the appetizers with spicy tuna & crispy rice as well as some sort of cucumber/caviar combo were fantastic openers to an otherwise pricey dinner.<//Review>< Time>

They served the New York Steak warm. You can tell it was not freshly cooked. It was just warmed up and then served to our table. Didn't feel the welcome atmosphere from the moment I walked in. Hostesses were giggling about us and whispering something to each other. Didn't even give a complementary desert on my birthday. Disappointed and not what I expected at all.< /review>

<review>The chefs deserve 5 stars, food is very moist, tender and favorable. They make the place.. The staff are very welcoming and pleasant.Beautiful decor and very large dining areas.

Its Overly priced and tiny portion. Describe as shareble tapas size, easy to spend over $175 and go home hungry. For example $20 teriyaki chicken (1 breast)  $34 steak with mushroom, more mushroom then steak. $10 roasted peppers appetizer, shrimp tempura ~5 pieces, sushi roll is narrow and long,  Shared with 4 people, it felt like rations.

Lunch is probably the best value, dinner is not.</review><time>1519021473239<//time><Rating>3< /Rating><GmapID>0x80c2bf391265d04f:0x61a13f0966697b2c< /GmapID>< pictures>

Good food but very expensive. Not worth the price in my opinion. Also, they have a smoking area right outside the front door which they leave open. Cigarette smoke while eating a meal that I'm paying too much for isn't fun. Probably wouldn't return.< /Text>

< Review>
Unique decor and ambience made this a memorable dining experience.  High end Japanese isn't about quantity, it's about quality and our dinner met the expectation. Spicy tuna on crispy rice was as good as you'd think. Miso butterfish was good, not great, but that isn't a knock. I'd still go back to order it again if I lived locally. I was in between 4 or 5 stars, but really couldn't justify removing a star. This was a one-time visit so take my advice with that grain of salt. Can't vouch for consistency, wait time, or service on a crowded night.<//Review>

<Text>Amazing! Came for an early dinner after a matinee at Pantages, and was very impressed. We had a reservation and were seated right away. The servers were very attentive and explained everything we asked about. The decor was very interesting and elegant. We felt cool just being there, haha. We started with the gyoza, which were perfect. I had the famous miso black cod, which was LITERALLY melt-in-your-mouth tender. Like, I had never tasted fish like that, it was spectacular. It was served with some lightly pickled vegetables that offset the sweetness very well. My wife, who doesn't like seafood at all, had the teriyaki chicken, which she said was the best she had ever had. The drinks are too expensive (where are they not?), but overall it was not as pricey a meal as we expected for how nice the restaurant, service, and food were. Would absolutely go again!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Remember the neo-futurist, maybe a little suspect Japan-philia/phobia of the 90's, around the time movies like 'Rising Sun' came out and everybody was terrified of being acquired by a keiretsu, but also a little excited? Imagine that was a restaurant. The staff are nice, the decor is bizarre, the food is fine, but the cocktails have this real weird tint to them. I liked it... but... was weirded out and maybe it set off my, "Is this okay, from a cultural standpoint?" alarms?< /Text>

<review>Not a bad sushi place located in the heart of Hollywood. The crispy rice with spicy tuna is amazing, and the rock shrimp is not bad either. My favorite thing here was the salmon sashimi with cavier and the spicy albacore with crispy onions. The service here was pretty good as well with the server coming by and wiping the table and refreshing the drinks. It was a bit expensive for what you got but overall worth it for the experience.<//review>< gmap_id>

My partner and I visited on a recent Friday night and had high hopes for the evening.  We found the service to be adequate (though not stellar) but the food quality to be lacking. Also the price point was a bit surprising.  This was expensive meal we had, and it was also the worst value for our money.<//Text>

Over priced, small portions of mediocre sushi.  I get better cuts of fish at "I Love Sushi" in Ventura, and that isn't even close to the best place in town.  A real disappointment.<//Text>

I had the salmon lemon roll, brussel sprout starter & wagyu fried rice. Everything was insanely good. Loved it all. This will be incredibly addicting. Deducted one star because of how pricey it was.

Also went back and had the baked salmon hand roll and the fried rice spicy tuna. So good!</text>

<text>Traveled to LA on business. One of the most disappointing meals I've ever purchased. Slow service, rushed through the ordering process, cannot accommodate allergies, cocktail took forever, appetizer served at exact same time as main entree, wagyu and foie gras ice cold the moment it hit the table, had to ask twice for fork and knife to eat STEAK, no sauce, ginger, or wasabi offered with sushi, which also took forever and wasn't anything special. Oh, and was sat directly next to a loudly fighting and sobbing mother and daughter. Will never return or recommend.</text>< Pics>

<Review>Heavily overpriced for small portions. It is to be expected in the district of Hollywood. The waiters described it as a tapas styled restaurant. I ordered foie gras wagyu beef, salmon and sea urchin sashimi. Their sea urchin sashimi was some of the best I've ever had. They served around 3 ounces of sea urchin sashimi per order. They have a nice cocktail section. I highly recommend the watermelon cucumber. The waiters were friendly and accommodating, albeit understaffed.<//Review>< resp>

<username>Arthur Nen</username>< Review>
The bad:  Staff was horrible, table was ready 25mins late for our reservation (even though the place was dead), server messed up our order many times and never came to our table to check on us, refill drinks, etc.

The meh:  Even though this is not an expensive restaurant to eat sushi, it was still of low quality even when compared to much cheaper places.  Their Toro was the saving grace, the rest of it was mediocre at best (I had the omakase, so tried a bit of everything).

The good:  The place is cool, on the outside and in.  They also gave me this JP vibe, with the staff resonating "irasshaimase" across the restaurant every time new guests arrived.  The crispy Brussels sprout starter, yep, get that.</Review>

This is one of those places where you only need to eat there once.

After all the hype (celebrity sightings) and hearing all of my friends talk about this place, my friend and I decided to eat here for DineLA week. We made reservations for Thursday night at 7:00 PM.

The location is cool near the middle of Hollywood, near the Pantages and other theatres, concealed in a corner of the Boulevard. There is no place to find cheap parking so we paid $10 for the valet (expensive).

The entrance of the restaurant looks pretty cool, it's all glass so you can see the bar and contemporary designed environment. There are a lot of homeless people near the stairs on the sidewalk though, which made it awkward waiting for the valet/ standing outside the restaurant.

The restaurant wasn't too busy (but it got busy later when only one big table was empty), music was playing loud and the bar was packed. We were both ready to order since we knew the menu but the waitress didn't take our order until 5 minutes later.

The appetizer came out a couple of minutes later. I had onion albacore, which was much more onion than albacore. It was flavorful, but tiny, which left me unsatisfied. My friend ordered crispy rice with spicy tuna which was really good. However, there were only two pieces so the portion was too tiny. Then again, it was DineLA price so I guess it was only a sample.

Anyways, a long time later we got our tonkatsu. The tray looked nice. The beef bits and mushroom were tender and delicious, though a little salty. The glaze made the whole dish really good.

Last we got ice cream mochi, a single piece cut in half with a few pieces of fruit and panna cotta. Nothing special.

In conclusion, the food was good (highlights being the crispy rice and beef) but nothing amazing, the environment was modern and mostly aesthetically pleasing, and the service was average (food took forever but the waiters actually refilled my water lol). The sushi was better than most, but for its price the experience was not worth it. Katsuya definitely doesn't live up to its hype and celebrities really need to get better taste if they keep coming here.

(Side note: The bathrooms are really cool but kinda creepy. The napkins are reallly really nice)< /review>

I wanted to confirm that this review is for Katsuya Hollywood. We have actually never had a Tonkatsu or Panna Cotta on the menu here. Regardless, we would love to have you back in for this years DineLA menu! We actually rolled out a brand new menu in April and are very excited about it!

< review>
Our server was really nice and it was a cool atmosphere, however,  the sushi was mediocre and over priced.  If I'm spending ing $18 on a roll,  I expect it to not only look like a price of art,  but it to taste like delicious as well.  I was incredibly disappointed.<//review>

An SBE Katsuya production... feels like Katsuya sold out here.  Overpriced.  Pretentious hostesses and servers.  Skip this one and make the drive to the original in Studio City.</Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Pompous and delicious restaurant with Asian fusion cuisine. The table must be ordered in advance! Any dish is a work of art, but for lobster with mushrooms you can give half your life)))
Those who want to show themselves and see others are welcome evening dress code, but in casual you will feel great.

(Original)
Помпезный и очень вкусный ресторан азиатской фьюжн кухни. Стол заказывать обязательно заранее! Любое блюдо - произведение искусства, а за лобстер с грибами можно полжизни отдать)))
Кто хочет себя показать и других посмотреть - приветствуется вечерний дресскод, но и в casual будете чувствовать себя прекрасно.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Price performance is not right here .. food was ok but nothing special! Dark .. hardly anything going on! The wine tasted super cheap for 14 € the glass. For me it was nothing!

<Text>(Translated by Google) I was invited, so I don't know the prices that will surely be above average.
Refined interior location, impeccable service, and fantastic food.
Japanese cuisine among the finest ever eaten in my life. At the top!

Sono stata invitata ,quindi non conosco i prezzi che saranno sicuramente sopra la media.
Raffinata la location interna, servizio impeccabile,e cibo fantastico.

A different sushi from the one I usually eat in Italy .. Price in the norm for Los Angeles. In my opinion if you are looking for a fusion it is worth considering it.

<review>(Translated by Google) One of the best Japanese restaurants I have tried, there is something for everyone whether you want sushi or hot dishes. Do on top of that in front of you. The products are fresh and of high quality, as are the dishes beautiful to look at. Very pleasant staff. And all this in a beautiful setting. I would stay there again the next time I am in LA.

(Original)
L’un des meilleurs resto japonais que j’ai essayé, il y en a pour tous les goûts que vous souhaitiez plutôt des sushis ou bien des plats chauds. Fait en plus de ça devant vous. Les produits sont frais et de qualité, ainsi que les plats beaux à regarder. Le personnel très agréable. Et tout ça dans un magnifique cadre. J’y retournerais la prochaine fois que je serais de passage à LA.</review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) They cheat tourists by asking big bucks like $ 40 for a simple glass of house wine and $ 50 per serving (6 rolls);
Also a long-haired black girl from outside staff was rude and rude, Service is bad!
Finally, they have not issued a receipt ...

(Original)
Imbrogliano i turisti chiedendo cifre esorbitanti come del tipo 40$ un semplice calice di vino della casa e 50$ a portata (6 rolls);
Inoltre una ragazza di colore con i capelli lunghi dello staff esterno è stata maleducata e sgarbata, Il servizio è pessimo!
Per concludere non hanno rilasciato scontrino fiscale...</text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) On Wednesday evening, our family used dinner at Katsuya. After a long day of travel, we just arrived in Los Angeles, we are not very hungry, so Tapas-style meals are more suitable for us. The price is reasonable and the food and drinks are delicious.
