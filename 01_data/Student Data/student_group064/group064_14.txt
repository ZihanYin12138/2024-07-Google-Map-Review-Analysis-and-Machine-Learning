The store owner claimed he can’t take a return due to covid however he could take the pants back and give store credit. That makes no sense. Then he said it’s a federal law which is totally BS. DO NOT SHOP HERE!!</Review>< Date>

<text>I came here looking for a Letterman jacket for my daughter. I was warmly greeted by Mr. Ray and he explained the options and answered all my questions.   I brought my daughter back to try on some jackets and design one she may want.  I did this 3 days before her Senior night. I said to Mr. Ray, " I'd love to be able to surprise her on Friday night!"  Well guess what! He made it happen! She loves it!
I recommend this store!  Thank you so much!</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Buyer beware! They know they are overpriced. They did not provide a receipt for items purchased close to $100. This business does not allow any returns because they know you will find more reasonable prices elsewhere, like down the same street.<//Review>< pics>

<date>1576438120507< /date><text>I came looking for something and the store owner was on the phone for a while before being able to assist me. There wasn't any acknowledgment beforehand. When I was finally tended to, I was asked a question, and when I responded that disclosing my place of work isn't necessary he became irate.  At one point in the minute in a half dialogue, he snatched the box from my hand and told me to buy from someplace else.

I am disappointed in the owner's customer service and I do not recommend coming in. I love supporting local businesses, and this interaction with the pretentious owner leaves younger men and woman like me comfortable waiting a couple of days longer for something to arrive in the mail from online competition.</text>< rating>

Expensive, as much as I wanted to purchase quite a few things. My desire was over shadowed by prices and turned off by no price tags on the items. Kinda makes one think that price may vary on individual or mood of sales person.<//review>

Went to pick them up the wonderful lady at the counter went to the back to get them and couldn't find the order.
She sent me an email a couple of hours later saying she had them. I drove back to the store and she stated she had gotten hold of the owner and he said he had so many shirts and PE shorts that he "Racked" them.
I had paid in advanced so I am a bit upset. An extra trip to pick up a prepaid order.
Should have been placed in a bag, my name on it and put in a location with other prepaid orders.
This is not the way to get repeat business.

If your looking for sports related items, there is more than you can imagine at a high price here.. BUT for anything else RUN away!!! Trust me it is worth driving to Santa Clarita. Especially for explore program uniforms. He charges shipping for uniforms he has in stock!!!! My son needed just the green shorts for PT & I ended up paying $29 because he charged me for shipping even though I found a big stack of the green shorts and I personally picked the size myself before he decided to help me, his excuse was that the stack of 30+ shorts was already sold so I have to pay for express shipping so the missing shorts can be replaced. Thats BS because I knew for a fact that all the other explorers already had their PT uniform. And FYI he only sells the uniforms in sets NOT separate, the reason I was able to buy the shorts only I gave him the excuse that our dog accidentally ripped the one we already bought.

Soffe Juniors Athletic Short, Dark Green.  These are the shorts required for explorer program. Just google it to find a store near you.  Kohl's has them for $7.99<//Text>

<text>Owner/only employee/cashier/security.  (Whitch is the same person) Is very unpolite if you dont buy what he offers. plus he can be rude and makes you feel uncomfortable to even shop..he wants to know too much and always his same line of 30 years experience . But can't relocate his store to a bigger place   it's over crowded and over priced.. if it was possible I would rate it a 0 🌟</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

The owner is rude and gruff. Store is really  crowded with merchandise which makes it hard to move around. And I found out that this place marks their prices up 150% for what you can purchase from somewhere else of the same exact brand and article.< /text>

<text>I cannot stand this place they have so many nice things but they are far too overpriced on all of their merchandise the people that work there are not courteous at all they do not give you a warm hello how are you doing or ask if you need help I have been in there multiple times I figured the first time or two they were just having a bad day so I figured I would give them the benefit of the doubt I will never ever go there again or refer anybody to that place it's a shame too because they have so many nice things but they're too overpriced and the service is there are terrible don't waste your time or your money going to that place if I had an option to give them zero Stars I would they're lucky that you even got one star.< /text><user>104930800739212931224< /user>< Date>

New girl on register, so our order got a little mixed up. But the staff is very friendly and upbeat, and they quickly corrected the issues. Food was well worth the (short) wait! My gf eats a low-sodium diet and had no problem with her pulled chicken wrap or the sauces. Deliciousness!< /Review>

After reading all of the reviews on this nearby place I decided to give them a try.  Some of the reviews are either fake or extremely mean spirited people.  The place is reasonably clean.  The service was courteous and efficient.  The food was served quickly, 5 minutes to my table after ordering.  I had the tri tip platter with corn bread, and Mac & Cheese.  The tri tip was well cooked and very tender and tasty.  The Mac & Cheese tasted homemade not from a box.  I ordered a side of onion rings which were a bit greasy but tasty and also appeared to be homemade.

Was this the best BBQ I ever had?  No.  Was it the worst, far from it.  It is a small, appears to be family owned place that is trying to make a go of it in overtaxed, over charged rents, and over regulated California.  Give them a break!  I will return, it was tasty and satisfied my BBQ craving tonight.  I wish people would consider the families, employees and the owners of these small places before leaving harsh and mean spirited reviews that are not called for.<//Text>

TERRIBLE SERVICE / POOR FOOD QUALITY!

I stumbled across this place. It looked inviting and the menu featured a lot of creative options. There was a lunch special, so I thought I would give it a try.

What a mistake!

The cashier informed me there was a 15 minute wait to receive my take-away order. After checking-in on the order multiple times, it actually took them 45 minutes to prepare a simple chicken wrap with a side of hush puppies!

By the time I got the food, I was so hungry I ate pretty quickly.

It turns out that there was a 1/2-inch long, relatively thick chicken bone in the wrap! I almost chocked on it!

The staff here do not seem to put the necessary effort in for customer service and careful preparation of the food.

It's a shame, this place could be really cool if they worked on managing their operations.

The food tasted "alright".. (nothing worth coming back for), but obviously the service and poor food quality (chicken bones still in the meat) are enough reason to avoid this place!< /review>< Resp>

<text>Below average BBQ place. I had the beef sandwich. The meat had very little seasoning. The BBQ sauce was average and a little sweet for my taste. The hush puppies were soggy inside and had little flavor. Overall, considering the prices these guys charge, they really need to step up their game.<//text>< Response>

Clearly the poor reviews are given by Phil's snobs. This place is an exceptional value. Loved the pulled pork and the sauces remind me of Nashville. Meat quality true to the craft. Will be back.</Review>

Good food but... sometimes they burn the burgers. A few weeks ago we ordered the mini burgers and they were RAW. They did not care when we showed them and told them. I like my burgers cooked medium well not raw or well done or burned. -1 for burned food, -2 for raw food and forgetting stuff, +1 for excellent food. If I could I would give 2.5 stars. I still like this place but I have to give it a not so good review for a few issues. Very friendly staff.< /Text>

First time at BBQ Republic. Went there on a recommendation.  Good call all round. BBQ TriTip "sammich" is a must. DELICIOUS!!! Will definitely go there again. Hopefully next time it'll be after duty hours so I can partake in the adult cooling beverages.  . .</Text>

The flavors are mouthwatering and even the carbs are amazing - the best corn bread and hush puppies in SoCal! It is so good we drive 30 minutes to get there. This is a one-off local place.

The service here is fantastic! Friendly and ready to help with suggestions. The food is SOOOOOO GOOOOD! Seriously. From their BBQ tacos (WHAT?!) to their Shredded Pork sandwiches to their baked potatoes the size of a babys leg, this place has got it goin on! I might even say they are gonna give Phil's a run for their money (especially since there's never a long wait!)< /Review>

Basically a little dive bar. Reasonable prices. Some craft beers, ok standard cocktails. This is a neighborhood bar that caters to locals.< /Review>

This was the spot when the parkway was open next door. After 2008 though there wasn't as many patrons as it used to be. But when the gentrification came to this side of the lake. Surprisingly patronage increases. At least that's what I can tell from the last time I went in there to shoot pool and have a few drinks with a lady friend. But I along with many people from the neighborhood have lots of history with this place. To me it will be always known as the triad bar(no racial pun intended).< /Text>

The asian woman (bartender/owner?) is extremely rude and racist. I've been here before and every time the place is pretty empty. This time was no different, but she was making rude comments to other patrons that we were driving her business away because not everyone had ordered drinks within the first 5 minutes of arriving. One of the other patrons did call her out for being rude. We left shortly after.<//review>

Highly recommend getting the al pastor, but also make sure to try the lengua and cabeza. They can also customize your order however you want, some goto’s are adding cheese (to anything), getting pineapple, or adding veggies!

<Date>1574380126711< /Date><rate>4< /rate><Review>The "Mulita de Asada" is what you want to order here. In a mulita, meat is sandwiched with cheese between two corn tortillas and griddled until the cheese melts, somewhat similar to a quesadilla. Unlike a quesataco or vampiro, low heat and grill times are used to melt the cheese in the mulitas to avoid the tortillas from crisping up. The carne asada was finely-chopped and could have been just about any meat, but had a tender texture, and the mixture of meat, cheese, grease, and tortilla took well to Taco Zone's tangy and fragrant light green salsa.

I ordered a "Suadero Taco" as well, but was way less impressed. Here, they use real suadero (a small cut of meat just before a cow's hind legs and above its udders) unlike most other taco operations in L.A. that use brisket, flank, or other cuts of beef. You can usually tell because, unlike brisket, suadero is very difficult to chew and needs to be marinated, simmered in a charola (a stainless steel disc with a raised convex dome), and then chopped into very small pieces to be palatable. A good general rule is that if you can see the grain in the meat, you're not eating actual suadero, you're likely eating brisket or flank steak. If the meat is grainless or chewy, you're probably eating suadero.

Here, the suadero is indeed finely chopped (like the asada), but much chewier. Unlike other real suadero I've had, Taco Zone's did not taste like much; it seemed as if both the flavors and juices had been cooked out of it and it was rendered stiff and dry. I much preferred the carne asada.< /Review>< pics>

my favorite place for al pastor; I can't seem to find anywhere else that does al pastor like they do! it's always a treat for me to steal away to their stand and get a quesadilla al pastor! just note that they are closed on Mondays!

also, they are now located on 30th St and Vermont Ave, just look for the string lights on 30th St (not 27th as some other review mentions)< /review>

I wanted to try al pastor but it wasn't ready 15 minutes after opening. The lengua, cabeza, and chicken tacos were good as well as the guacamole and salsas but I don't think I will come back anytime soon due to the long line and slow service. The horchata needs more flavor.< /Text>

Great tacos! The lengua tacos are so good, the al pastor is very tasty then only reason they dont get 5 stars is because the horchata is on the weaker side. The staff is friendly and fast!</review>

I made it there with plenty of time, but he knew I was the one who called.  He was polite, considerate and super nice! This is the type of customer service missing in many of today's businesses. The cost for the smog test was super fair. I cannot rave about how lovely the experience was. FYI, enter through the alley, it's much easier!

The service person was very friendly and quick to help with my smog inspection. The waiting room was outdated and in need of some help. He was very quick and thorough. He gave me a discount even though I didn't have any coupons. Price was very good and I will be returning.<//text>

<review>FAST and courteous service! The owner even suggested a kiosk to quickly get my registration stickers and the best time to go. He also gave us FREE "energy pills"! (candy LOL!) I'll definitely be taking all my cars here for smog checks and any other subsequent auto needs. Try this guy out if you haven't. You won't regret it!< /review>< pics>

<Review>Been bringing my cars here for years now. Although it looks a little run down, it's a star certified smog place and he is quick to get it tested. Guy even gave me a coupon for having well mannered kids. Best way to enter is through the alleyway in the back. Waiting room is a bit dirty but thats to be expected. Always have a pleasant honest experience here.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Rating>5</Rating>< GmapID>

He works on several cars simultaneously. took just over 25 minutes from start to driving off. Clearly explained that my data had been send to DMV electronically already. Fast, punctual and cheaper than the one I used last time.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5z5sZA52T6GSC72YUe4Duz_w_ZQsCmMm6bikP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-75DHx85uu1TfGmW17BJhggiEL8LLI8AOa970=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

Excellent service and truly honest man whom helped me tremendously.  I have a 2000 Tundra which passed smog last year. I did not pass this year because the technician discovered my check engine bulb burnt out thus me not knowing there was a problem. Within two months once repaired he will resmog for free. Great guy!</Text>

<review>All Smog USA is great! I was early for my appointment and was still finished within a half hour and there were two vehicles ahead of me.
The waiting time was pleasant as there are lots of flowers inside the waiting room.
Aka in all, I highly recommend this business.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>Been coming here for the past five years. I've brought all three of my cars here. Owner is very friendly, very quick, and gives you discounts. One of my cars did fail smog once because it wasn't ready, and he didn't charge me. The waiting room is a little dated and not the nicest, but you're only here 30 minutes or less, so it's not a big deal for me. Highly recommend coming here. I'll be back in another two years.<//Text></record>

I called the day before and made an appointment for 10 in the morning.  This is a Star ststion.  Arrived at 10.  Abbas(the owner I think) took car and positioned it for test.  Test took about 10min(it passed).  I paid the fee(45).  Total time was about 15-20 min.  Office interior and work bay were clean.  I will go there from now on.< /Text>

It’s not the newest smog place in Oxnard, but this guy is pretty fast and has great customer service. If your car is not ready and will fail he is pretty honest about it. I always try to take my vehicles here first even though I need to drive across town to do it.</review>

<text>Fast and quick smog test. There were 2 customers ahead of me and was still done in 20 min. Technician who took care of me was very friendly, apologized for the aged waiting area, but with the excellent customer service received, that was not even an issue for me. Received a discount even thought I did not ask for one. A++<//text><GmapID>0x80e84e8c51ea5a97:0x83801d9b9b8a6f24</GmapID><Response>None<//Response><date>1548104909145</date><Pics>None</Pics>< user>

Awesome Service! Super fast, had me in and out in under an hour and there were two customers ahead of me when I arrived an hour before closing. Also gave me $10 off without a coupon or anything. Small but pretty clean and comfortable waiting area with a TV and magazines.< /review>

The service was very quick, and the attendant was very friendly! I saw him greeting and welcoming other customers, and he made them all smile and laugh. I got some good advice, tips, and pointers before I left too! No hidden fees and a comfy couch to wait.<//Text>

Went in right at 8 before work. Crazy fast, out in 15 minutes. Owner was super nice, turned on TV and heater so I would be comfortable- what a nice gentleman. He gave me all my paperwork, explained each document, then I was all done. He gave me a handful of the famous Hershey chocolate kisses when I left :)</Review>

The attendant was friendly, welcoming, and extremely quick. At 3pm on a Friday afternoon there was one person ahead of me and he got me in and out in only 12 minutes! I didn't even get a chance to finish the chocolate the attendant gave me. I'm coming back the next time the DMV makes me get another smog check.

One other review mentioned the waiting room being filthy and the desk was rather cluttered, but that didn't bother me. The chairs were pretty comfortable for the 12 minutes I spent there.< /Text>

<text>The place is a bit older and could use a remodeling but the service is hands down worth 5 stars. Abbas is always there when I go back every year and he honors the $10.00 off he gave me 4 years ago. He is courteous and has the vehicle back to me within 15-20 minutes. I will not go to another smog test in the area...only this one. Thanks Abbas.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This California smog station is very good.  I checked several smog stations near my home (Oxnard, CA) and this one offers the lowest price for a passed smog test and certificate ($45 total).

I was fortunate to be the first line when I drove my car to the station on Monday morning at 9 AM.  The service technician stated that it would take about 20 minutes to have my out of state car inspected.  And it took that long.

There is seating inside the old and somewhat chilly waiting area.  Fortunately, there is a TV and plenty of magazines to read in case you need to wait for a long time.  There is free water, but no snacks as I've read in others' comments.

I recommend this smog station, based on my experience.  I plan to take two other vehicles there when the appropriate time comes.< /review>

<Text>Went here yesterday based off the good reviews, and the kind gentleman who did our smog check definitely lived up to the high expectations!  Fast, friendly, polite service.  Went out of his way to give me an extra copy for my out-of-state DMV requirements, and gave me a military discount that I didn't even have to ask for.  Also provided the nice extra touch of turning the truck around for us so we wouldn't have to try to back out into a busy street.  We'll be back next year!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Review>Abbas is a miracle worker (he knows what to look at in the right order when troubleshooting). My car had more than 6 smog error codes (check engine light was on too). I thought I was looking at over a grand (Volvo) but fortunately it was less than a third of that! Great service - great guy!<//Review><name>Damian Spooner (DJ)< /name>< Pics>

i was looking all over in the web for great reviews on a smog check station and everyone was RIGHT about all smog usa!!! abbas was very kind and explained the time is would take and what would it cost. working in sales and dealing with people i was surprised when he asked how did you hear of this location, asked if i would come back and if i would recommend friends and family. you know this man takes his job/business seriously. and told him of course i would recommend his place. the service was great and quick on a SATURDAY!!<//text>

I have been coming here since 1998.  I have done everything from services to buying tires from them.  Today,  I went in for a rotation and balance.   I was in and out with 15 minutes.  No exaggeration!.  It has been the same service since day 1.<//text>

Been going here since i was a kid living in Salida, now as an adult living in Modesto, I will still make the journey for the quality service alone. Just got brand new tired recently and not only is the price a bargain theyll even rotate them for free in 5000 miles(albeit not uncommon) but id tell you the speed of them switching out my tires was exceptional. Id say it was done well under 20 min. These guys will treat you right and respect ur car!</Text>

After being served up a pile of lies and pressure tactics from Les Schwab Tire, we abandoned the tire store were we had previously given 6 years of all our family business when we had tire needs. However, after they refused to honor the mileage promise on our 18 month old tires we asked our mechanic for a recommendation and Luis at Low Cost Automotive in Ceres gave us Ocampo's contact information and we are very happy with the tires, alignment and service we received today!!

We will take all of our family tire needs to Ocampo's Tires in Salids. I appreciate their straight forward approach to servicing OUR NEEDS, their prices are much better than Las Schwab and they are so fast with the tire changes!!! Next time I drive by Las Schwab, I'll speed past that tire trap business and I'll recommend Ocampo's Tire to all of my friends and family😊</text>

TRAVEL ANY< /user_name>
<Review>For customer service over the phone I’ll give 5 stars but the pizza came very cold and dry it was 58 minutes after we called on a weekend dinner time .( I was told 35-45)
We order from them only all the time we use $4 off coupon that’s maybe the reason we got a bed pizza.
We order some topics but The one that was missing the most was artichoke
It’s look like they were very cheap about how much they can add you can barely see it.
We had to worm the pizza in the oven for another 10 minutes
If I want to hit my own pizza i’ll go to the store and buy a frozen pizza
Witch taste the same as this particular day<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>I am giving the five star to the supervisor Cory (sp?).  While I was waiting for my order, I noticed he is a great multitasker and even though he was busy, he did acknowledge me and took care of my order very fast.  He is a young man who is a hard worker and has excellent customer service skills.  He deserves a raise!</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

< review>
We've ordered delivery from this location twice and they do not disappoint! The first time was through GrubHub and there were some complications but Grubhub was at fault and the manager at Round Table table did everything possible to make us happy... and we were :) Ordered again for dinner tonight and again, we are happy! Our order was exactly correct, perfectly cooked, and they delivered 2 minutes before the estimated time. I'm just so glad that they deliver all the way to us, we are in Carmel Valley off of the 56 and Carmel Country Rd. We have other pizza spots close by, Dominos, Oggi's,Sammy's, and even URBN but we will always choose Round Table! They have quality pizzas and decent promotions.
We had the Chicken & Garlic Gourmet, the double play pepperoni, and 6 garlic parmesan twists (free after signing up). Everything was delicious!< /review>

<review>I love Little Star! The thin crust and deep dish pizzas are equally delicious, and they're very accommodating about customizing the toppings or doing half and half. Pro tip: go after work on Monday or Tuesday to enjoy happy hour ( $4-5 beers and wines) all the way up to 9:30 PM.< /review><Time>1593661871952<//Time>< UserId.>

I get round table every week. They are always on time with delivery, very friendly, and of course the pizza (and I get garlic twists) are warm and delicious!</Review>

Terrible place overcharged for the buffet with a coupon and they only had two pizzas out and spoiled cottage cheese not great service for a buffet. Total should of been $16.45 with half off coupon and 1 drink we were charged $17.35 what a shame. They need to do a better job and serving customers.< /review>

<Review>I had six boys and all of them love pizza… We kept looking for the great pizza place here in San Diego close to us and round table had so many amazing crusts and toppings that it quickly became a favorite. One of the best pizzas was there deluxe, with lots of vegetables and meat. That’s a mom trying to get something healthy into her kids!<//Review><user_id>102005083819762661368</user_id></record></dataset><record>

I tried their specialty vegetarian pizza, it's delicious and unique. If you are bored of regular pizzas which only looks good on TV then you need to try this place.< /text>

I drove to the store to pickup the pizza. The guy in line in front of me had ordered a pizza to go. They couldn't find any record of his order. They had to search for our pizzas, and finally found them. Thanks Round Table for a memorable Birthday celebration. Pizza was okay but over priced.

The pizza is much better than Domino's or Pizzahut and definitely Little Caesar's. But like any pizza it's best to eat it when it's fresh. A little expensive though. So 4 stars.< /Text>

Piazza was good and they offer beer too. But now they have gone to the new machine which offers every type of drink. And of course all with sugar. No more unsweetened tea. I know but it is a pizza place be real. But they do have salads which you can still be with friends that eat the pizza and you be good! It's harder every day to be good with food</Review>

I absolutely love this company! I've been a patron of this location in PQ since my family moved to the area in 1990. Definitely glad this company hasn't gone under like so many others! I've always been a die hard fan and no matter what I still come back/only order my pizzas for me here.</review>

Pleasant, had lunch buffet. Wasn't overly crowded and choices were plenty. Salad bar could have spruced up some of the options but otherwise a nice place for lunch. Not sure if new management in place but certainly better service than just a year ago.< /Text>

Although prices are a tad high, the pizza is more than worth the price, and in fact the one time I had a problem with the service provided, I spoke to the manager Stephanie, and she went out of her way to make my feelings feel validated and in the end she took care of me, and managed to keep a longtime Round Table customer coming back, and she managed to ensure I will come to her shop time and time again. Thank you Stephanie for taking care of your customers and truly going above and beyond.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Overpriced for the strictly "chain" quality of the pizza. Tried it both for dinner and later for a lunch buffet. The staff put up two pizzas, both with pepperoni and didn't get the hint when several people walked up, looked at them, and then walked away. The pizzas remained on the buffet for nearly an hour. An additional, non-pepperoni pizza was eventually added and disappeared immediately.

The salad bar was basic, but it did good business, as no one was touching the pizza.<//Text>

I love Roundtable Pizza! I feel the ingredients are quality and their pizzas always taste good. This location offers an all-you-can-eat option on Tuesday nights. They also serve craft beers here. I will say, and it has been said before, their prices are expensive for pizza.< /Text>

<text>Ah, childhood memories.  I really like round table pizza and it was great having one so close to my old house.

They have a nice crunchy crust and you can get some healthier toppings.

Unfortunately, their pizzas can be a bit greasy.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Outstanding experience! We were lucky enough to come for dinner on a Tuesday evening, day when they host a pizza buffet. Family of five, we all ate for $30. Pizza was fresh, cinnamon sticks and garlic parmesan sticks were delicious, always hot, straight from the oven to the buffet table. All the other pizzas as well, staright from the oven. They had a great variety of pizzas. The ones with the veggies on had fresh looking and testing vegetables; usually, pizza buffets tend to make the pizza with a lot of dough and not a lot of ingretients; not this pizzas. This pies were thin, light, and crunchy!
Salad bar was good, basic, but satisfying. Staff was friendly, helpful, and I liked that they were announcing what pizza was coming out of the oven.
We will definitely come back. It was so worth the drive.< /text>< Pictures>

How in the hell do you justify the prices? Seriously! $30 for a medium pizza and 2 drinks?? And awful boy-band music blasting my head off to add insult to injury? This is my first and LAST visit to Round Table.</review>

This place rocks. Super fast delivery. Mind you, I only like their "gourmet" pizzas - way better ingredients and recipes. Maui Zowie is my fave.< /Review>

First and last time at round table.  Terrible pizza large pie xcheese 1/2 mushroom
26$ never again , it's like they took a soft taco shell an put sauce cheese an mushrooms on it
Nasty , what ever happened to a real pizza place with a real pizza oven
Pizza ovens have one opening and the pizza maker is a craftsman
Garbage in made in an oven that goes in one side and out the other</text>

< Review>
Management and workers here are welcoming. It has a pool which is nice and a yoga room upstairs which I particularly enjoy. I like that this location is not always super full, so it is not intimidating to get in the weight machines.< /Review>

<Review>The pool heater is still not working.  The amenities (shampoo, conditioner, shaving soap) have all disappeared from the showers.  12/29 the hot tub in the women's locker room was once again closed by the Dept. of Health.  No one seems to get a response to e-mails.  I can only presume the new owners spent all their money on the new equipment and "decorating" so they have nothing for upkeep.  Why did I ever think it was a good deal to sign up for a full year!  Do NOT join this club.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>This place is closing on the 15th. When I started coming here years ago it was clean had towel service and a friendly atmosphere. Last couple of months towel service was cut off, sauna broke and was never fixed and the Hydro Massage tables kept breaking down. I enjoyed this gym because it was close to home but now will have to find somewhere else to workout.<//Text>< username>

<Review>UPDATE:  the quote Google has chosen is NOT in reference to this facility, but another by the same company. Please read full review! Google, please correct.

This place could be fantastic. COULD. I genuinely like this gym, but its sorely lacking in TLC and effective management.

I give it three stars because they have a pool and awesome amenities like hot tub, cold plunge, sauna, and steam room.

However, they are sorely lacking in maintenance, cleanliness, and overall some very basic things (soap in the bathroom anyone?). If something breaks, don't expect it to be fixed. There's a water fountain in the women's locker room that has been broken and non-functional for well over a month. The door to the sauna is made out of glass and metal (yeah, METAL in a sauna) and the handle has been hastily taped over with foam insulation to keep you from burning yourself. The towels are dingy and old (if you can find any). Clogged drains, broken shower heads, missing hooks and shower curtains, broken mirrors in the workout areas... the list goes on.

Ironically, the brand new club on Meridian is top notch! They have the latest and greatest equipment and sparkling facilities. No pool and spa style locker rooms though.

It's clear that Fitness Evolution's corporate offices has dedicated all their resources to this new facility. But when you leave your "Elite" location in such disarray, that's simply poor business practices. All we want is for things to actually work and be clean. That's not asking for much.

You are only as strong as your weakest link.<//Review><name>Carmen L. Perez-Seda< /name>< Resp>

The price isn't bad for this gym, however; this gym doesn't have the most appealing look to it.  The "cardio" area, which is the first thing you see looks great,  the room in which you do lifting is...okay? I guess. but the weights are rusty,  and the machines are a bit jammed sometimes. the other rooms are alright, but not the best. Overall, it's not a bad gym for the price.<//review>

<Text>This is the abandoned step-child of the Fitness Evolution chain. It it The most poorly maintained, dirty, sad fitness club I've ever been to. They've cancelled all of the group exercise classes and yet they call this location an "elite" facility.  Junk is piled up everywhere for months, no one maintains any of the rooms, the two custodial staff per day are only there for limited hours and can't come close to keeping up. 100% of the deck chairs at the pool are broken and have been for almost a year. The only positives here are the location, the steam, the pool, the nice clientele -- and the fact that there is actually a lot of good equipment and space to work out if you can put up with the crappy facility.  If all you want is to get in, work out and get out -- you'll be ok. If you want amenities, forget it. Some of the staff try their best, but FitEvo corporation gives them nothing to work with.  The employees are like sailors on a sinking ship. The positive reviews for this location are bogus, definitely posted by employees.<//Text>< Time>

<date>1484863498597< /date><rate>1</rate><text>The only reason I use this place is because it's close to work.  I'm a guy and normally don't care that much about cleanliness, but man this place is gross.

For Example:
The locker rooms have broken lockers and really slimy floors.  The carpet is pulled up in a lot of areas.  The bathroom has had caution tape over one of the urinals for over a year.  Half of the sinks have mold on the faucets.  The weight room is littered with dumbells and plates all over the floor.  Only half of the treadmills ever work at one time.  The pool heaters have worked intermittently for over a year and a half and not to mention all of the dirt and toilet paper that litter that pool.  Man, c'mon.  A little upkeep and this place could be great.< /text>< Response>

Great gym, wonderful trainers. What really makes this place so awesome is the fact that the trainers are so knowledgeable. I was very impressed. This particular facility also has a heated swimming pool all year round. There's steam rooms and there is even a small workout area in the women's locker room. Thats actually nice for women who get together to workout and don't want to do all their cardio out on the main floor. There are small seats for seniors in the women's shower room - which is nice for people who are older or even the disabled. There are big light up mirrors and even television sets in the women's locker room. As I mentioned the trainers are super knowledgable. Knowledgeable and friendly. That is a win-win.</text>

I went in to join and was met by a manager name Karina. The look of disdain she gave me was searing base on what I was wearing. This is classic case of profiling and shame on her for judging a book by its cover. She answered my question very curtly and turned her back on me in discuss before I had a chance to ask another question. Her extreme rudeness toward me exemplify the ELITIST attitude of management and how they choose to alienate certain demographic. You will not find love thy neighbor as thyself at this gym!<//text>

What used to be San Jose athletic club is now fitness evolution. The club has some new equipment but the asthetics haven't been changed in 20 years. I go here solely for the pool. In that regard it meets my needs. Guys please wear rubber sandles in the locker room. From the amount of water on the ground it's easy to pick up athletes foot or a wart. For your skin health do yourself a favor and bring some $5 sandles.<//Text>

Located adjacent to the First Unitarian Church of San Jose, and across the street from Saint James Park, is the Masonic Lodge built in the 1924th year of our Lord. As of the time which this synopsis was written the building is owned by Mr. Barry Swenson, who counts Gold's Gym as a lessee: Fitness Evolution is a subsidiary of that corporation.

The cost is approximately $43/month, which is drastically less than could be expected considering the potential clientele. Potential downsides are that the organization is not in control of the lease (assumption), there is riffraff which brings a low-class element, and as has been mentioned in previous reviews there are some things that are to be desired, although during February 2016 there are renovations to the locker-rooms which suggest a gradual update is being implemented or phased in.

The other gymnasium which bears the same name in the immediate vicinity is significantly smaller and without the novel amenities which are particular to this location. Said features include the Pool (consisting of 5 lanes), the Sauna & Steam Room (a set of 2), a Massage room, plenty of space for relaxing poolside (e.g., outdoor space which is fenced off with a high wall), and the basketball court which is part of the eastern section of the facility (an add-on from the original temple complex).

The staff does not espouse animosity or duplicity, and is consistently professional. Although relatively young (taken as a mean), the haughty air that had plagued the previous establishment is absent: they are courteous and make an effort to welcome persons with more than a modicum of sincerity.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
The San Jose Athletic Club is under new managment Fitness Evolution since June 2014. Since the new managment the facility has rapidly deteriorated and the new managmenmt has been incapable to maintain the minimum standard to preserve and retain the membership. The pool is not accessible the heater is not working for the last month - Jacuzzi is also cold and the jets are in need of service. Half of the showers are not in use due to knobs missing. The constant and ongoing  issues with maintenance of lack of has created an environment where most members are constantly complaining to the staff to no avail. Corporate seem to not care or not willing or able to respond. Meanwhile many members where given the opportunity to sign up for a new contract for $ 360.00 the all year and no refund is allowed.<//Review>

<Review>The customer service of this place is amazing! The guys replaced all 4 tires on rims in less then 30 mins, they were professional and double checked their work to ensure safety. 4 brand new Wranglers later, we plan on going back to replace another set soon.</Review>< userid>

I bought some Sparco wheels online and brought hem to A&R to have them mounted and balanced. They did a great job. I noticed they put anti seize on all the threads for the lug-nuts. That is something I always do whenever I pull the wheels off of my cars. Impressed to say the least. I had previously asked him if he sold Sparco wheels but unfortunately they did not. I would have much rather made the purchase through them instead. But my daughter had her mind made up with the Sparcos.<//text>

<date>1609638376383</date><rating>5< /rating><review>Needed to get a tattoo ASAP and Rodge was quick to deliver. I even had to change the day of the my appointment and he was very understanding. At the moment, during restrictions from COVID, its appointment only but he let me come in so I could show him what I was looking for and what I needed to cover up.
It found it to be a very family oriented business. I didn’t mind one bit as I enjoyed the company but a few of his family members sat in the room during the tattoo process. They were all eager to see the results! They had a wide variety of colors so if you’re looking for a colorful piece, check out SoCal Ink! I’d say my tat came out great!</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdp8Jp3aYj3JfuGEH8GoJjL5RzTbLtV_2t3-Pe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

J bad was definitely the most professional tattoo artist I had the honor of working with he help me finish off my design and gave me some very good ideas took my design to a whole nother level . He was very professional and did not try to rush me through my process I appreciate that's the most. It took a couple of months for me to figure out what I wanted but well worth the wait. Great J bad</text>

I had gone to get a tattoo on Friday the 13th and yes I get it it’s a very busy day because their specials but I waited four hours just for them to take in two girls right away Who is showing a little extra skin i didnt even end up leaving with a tattoo was very upset it was very unprofessional very disappointed I have gone here a few times and this is the worst experience that will never make me want to go back again.its like they didnt want to help us if that was the case we couldve gone somewhere else instead of making us wait all night. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.< /Review>

If your ever looking for a great tattoo on a good deal head over to socal ink shop located in Oxnard and ask for Albert aka Xmen he is a really good artist. He will work with you until you get what you want. Very experienced and polite artists. I really recommend you get tatted by him.</review>

I had to schedule an appointment with JBad at this SoCal Ink Shop in Downtown Oxnard. I liked the way that he was very generous, friendly, patient, and calm making the experience of getting a tattoo from him. I would highly recommend going to him anytime. Prices are decent and they even use numbing spray now to not feel the stinging sensation of the needle on your skin. It was just a great experience and I would highly recommend going to him for any tattoo needs. Contact him for further info. IG is JBADTATTOOS, FB is JBADfrutos. Check out his profiles and artwork on there for more details and info.</review>

Dont recommend coming here for piercings the lady is very unprofessional and did my piercing wrong by giving me a too small bar and she didn’t not own up to her mistake and got hostile when I told her of the issue.</Review>

I love this theater.  We rented the entire theater out for a private screening of A Quiet Place.  The seats were recliners and so comfortable.</Review>

<date>1620343788626</date><text>I bought a private watch party for my family and I to see Mortal Kombat. It was awesome. The workers were all very nice. The theater itself was super comfortable with reclining seats and trays for our snacks. There was only four or five rows to choose from but since we were all family the seating didn't really matter. The best part was probably the fact that the chairs had heated seats. Overall our experience was amazing and I would definitely go there again.< /text>< rating>

<Text>Tip: Park at the near by parking structure. It only costs about two dollars to get enough time for a quick dinner and a movie. Make sure you have exact change as they only accept coins and one dollar bills. The machine does not give out change, so prepare accordingly.</Text>< pics>

Good theater. I was impressed with a customer said they needed someone on another register and then it happened. Dirty but maybe that's kind of normal for the food area.... Movie theater was comfy and clean from what I could see .<//Review>

Plenty of leg room. Tray for food. Leather chairs. Options for heated chair. Did not realize how amazing the seating is until we went to San Bruno Movies yesterday, which my 15 year old appropriately called, "an adventure to the past."<//text>

<review>Seating there is the best! Just need to get tickets early enough not to get stuck in the front row. Only downside hence the 4/5 is that it seems every time I'm here I need to let the staff know that many of the bathrooms are out of everything! They are very responsive, they just don't seem to be keeping great tabs on it themselves.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>Theater was awesome but, parking was somewhat of a challenge! We finally found a spot in a nearby parking garage.  So...if you want to be on time get there early so you can find a spot to park.  Otherwise it was an all around great theater.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>I really enjoy the new seats, they make the experience more enjoyable. Other than that it's a fairly standard movie theater. Although it is smaller than most of the other chain places. The service is just fine and the prices of the food was the typical high prices of a movie theater. Overall a fairly standard movie theater with the addition of nice new seats.< /Review><date>1559698722082<//date></record></dataset><record>

Wine & lattes available. Pizza hut pizzas from snack bar. Usual overpriced snacks. Comfy easy chair seats with student desk tray and cupholder a highlight. San Mateo parking garages have 3 hour limit, so unfriendly to moviegoers. Staff courteous.</text>

New seats .. I haven't been since they put the new seats with the desk that swing out.. brused my elbow on it when I was getting out of the seat . Also if I moved a little I would hit the button the seats are smaller and closer to other seats compared to other theaters.. Also the bathrooms weren't super swept. .and some one spilled a lot of pop corn it was all over.. y'all don't have better and quicker sweeper brooms.. 2 stars cause my elbow is red and blue.< /text>

The lounge chairs here just cannot be beat. Although I have 6 other theaters closer to my house I will still drive here just to enjoy the comfort. Also, since seats are assigned I don't have to worry about being late and having bad seats.< /review>

<text>Seating is comfy and they even have little tables on your seats and only location I've found that has jalapeno hot dogs. Nice place to go, but screens are small, like pretty small in most rooms. I always check my movie online first to see how many seats for that movie. The more seats, the bigger the screen.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

It was my first time in the theater and everyone was very attentive and helpful.  Parking wasn't a problem at all (most movies only last less than 2hours now a days anyway). The movie house was very clean and right after the film ended there was maintenance staff ready to clean after the patrons had left.  I give this movie house an A+.< /Text>

It was an amazing experience for me and my friends. It may be just some simple movie theater chairs, and a regular plus size screen but it’s a good way to get out of the house and do something with your family. The food was a little overpriced but not to the point where no one can handle it.</Text>

Update: They've renovated some. Screens are still a little small, but they've upgraded some screens to include loungers. There was a noticeable tear or stain on the screen I went to today. Although I prefer the theaters of neighboring cities, I at least consider it a viewing option. I've gone twice this year which equals the amount of times I'd been to this theater since moving here in 2004. It's a step in the right direction.

Old review:
Honestly, this is the closest theater to me by miles and I love movies. This theater is in bad need of renovation. I'm not going to complain about high school employees or the seats. It's just not comparable to newer theaters' screen size, comfort or sound. As entertainment choices and movie prices have grown, theaters need to offer an experience you can't come close to replicating at home. Can't say that some of their smaller screens fits this bill. San Mateo deserves a nicer theater.<//Text>

I remember the first time I saw this place, I was sure it would only have black and white movies. Well, it is a modern movie theater, even has 3D. Not that it's fancy by any standard today, but I was just so sure it wouldn't have it from looking at it from the outside. But considering San Mateo is pretty laid back in general, despite of the fact that  it's becoming another startup hotbed, I suppose it makes sense.</review>

Great movie theater. Might be biased since I'm from bay area, and our theaters sucks and are ancient.

Nice, clean, reclining chairs with lumbar support! And three heat settings omg! Only wish the seats had a table. That's all they're missing!

Staff was nice and cool. Would come here again!</Text>

It’s ashamed they don’t allow any backpacks and there’s no place to store them! Good thing they refunded my ticket but it was still a disappointment. Nevertheless, a cheap place to catch a movie! Can’t go wrong for $6.50+$1.70 on a Tuesday</review>

I want to rate the theater higher as I like the assigned seats and the recliners, the theaters are clean, the sound is good, everything theater-wise is great. But the people going to the movie are ruining it for me, talking as if they were in their living room, having conversations at full volume, yelling to each other over the loud parts of the movie. The incessant cell phone use. Addicts who can't put the tech down for a measley two hours and pay attention to the movie they just paid $13.50 to see. The last movie I went to, the person next to me checked his phone every 1 to 2 minutes and then pulled his t-shirt over his head to read his phone. I finally leaned over and asked him of he was a doctor or worked for the president. Was the country under attack and only he could save us all? The management shrugs and doesn't do anything to police bad behavior. If you are aiming at a luxury movie experience you need to enforce basic standards of decorum which won't happen with kids paid minimum wage and managers who don't care.
I go to this theater as little as possible because the audience is so poorly behaved. Put down your phones and be present!< /Review>

Has luxury loungers in many screens. Right in the middle of downtown San Mateo which is awesome. The snack shop at the front has usual stuff found in most theaters. Not hard to navigate given there are only 12 screens. One of problems for movie goers in noon or  evening would be parking. Just make sure to look around.</review>

Seats were very comfy and offered plenty of leg room, plus they were recliners.
Wasn't too loud which I've found the UK cinemas to be.
Could have walked back in and watched another film!
Parked at a multi storey 2 minute walk away, 50c per hour. We put in 4 hours but only needed 3 in the end.</review>< Pictures>

Excellent seats big wide with swivel table top.  Only problem is the train runs right next to the theatre so you get the noise/rumble of the train.  Otherwise I would have given a 5 star.  Parking garage less than one block and free after 6 p.m.  Many GOOD restaurants within complex and within one/two blocks.< /text>

Great new lux seats that recline and heat! Perfect to sit in ANY location now! Popcorn checkout line is super slow later in the evening, so leave LOTS of extra time for it. Customer service was stellar after a Not-perfect attempt to go to a late show. I was super impressed. The reason for only 4 stars was that the auditorium for the make/up late show had not been cleaned, and it had garbage ALL over the seats and floor near my chosen seat. The cozy couple in fact sat in my seat because they didn’t want to clean up the mess that was theirs... frustrating for all of us...
Try the great seats ❤️< /review>

Love this place. I have been here for film screening especially animated movies. I would highly recommend this place. Thumbs up. Seats are pretty comfortable and projection is fine. Popcorns and shakes are good. There should be more food variety at reasonable price.</Review>

<review>Comfortable, good place to see a movie.  Only complaint is that there are not always enough show times for popular movies, so if you don't buy your tickets far enough in advance, you're out of luck or can only get individual seats (so if you go with a friend or a date, you might not get to sit together--not good.. ).<//review>< GmapID>

< review>
Cinemas themselves are ok with decent quality facilities.  What makes it tough is the almost non-existent parking that means you have to arrive an hour before the movie to be able to spend 40 minutes waiting for a spot to come up that you can steal.

This is important because other cinemas have same or better quality facilities but you can show you 5 minutes before movie start and have a relaxing movie - that's not the case at San Mateo unfortunately.

Will go to other cinemas in the area next time.</review>

Century San Mateo just upped it's game!! Was pleasantly surprised to see amazing heated recliner seats during our recent visit of watching Jurrasic Park. The movie wasn't great but the seats were totally worth it. While seated in the reclined position, we couldn't see anyone seated in front of us. This made the movie experience very personal and awesome!< /Text>

A renovated theater with stadium seating outfitted with new reclining and heated seats.  It is nice to be able to reserve the seats ahead of time.  Parking on street or nearby garage is $0.75 per hour.  Thumbs up!< /text>

The location is phenomenal. Would have received 5-stars if it weren't for the off-putting service displayed by the male employee working the ticket booth this evening around 19:30. Clean facilities & comfortable chairs.<//review>

<Review>Great facilities and extremely comfortable seats in the theater; would definitely recommend going here to watch movies. The only reason I had to deduct 2 stars from my rating was an incredibly annoying cashier I was forced to deal with while getting my concessions. I was only buying 2 icees, yet the cashier that accepted cards charged me with the popcorn of the customers behind me as well. I was confused at first so I went to the cash cashier to pay instead, where I realized the blunder the card cashier had made. When I went back to pay with my card, the cashier simply stated they couldn’t help me and left their post, so I was forced to pay with cash at the end. Very irritating.</Review>< Pics>

Go to Century 12 San Mateo and relax in full-body faux-leather reclining and feet-propping seats that make your movie experience worth it!<//review>< Pictures>

I love the location of this theatre just next to a lot of restaurants and bar. Perfect for a dinner and movie date followed by drinks perhaps?

It's clean, and the staff is good. I love coming here during the matinee session when it's a little less crowded. The screens are good so is the 3D projection.< /review>

<review>Surprisingly small theater, when the location is taken into consideration.

Went for a late showing of Ghost in the Shell, but lack of staff made for a confusing snack purchase. It took us a couple minutes to realize you go forward, get snacks, then go back to pay.

Hopefully staff will be there to guide in the future.

Otherwise, typical movie experience. Auditorium 8 was clean, the picture and sound good, too.<//review>< Pictures>

Not sure if they did for all auditoriums. The one we went to has upgraded seating that's wider, with lots of space between rows, zero-gravity reclining, and seat warmer. The seats are so comfortable, my wife wants to buy them for our home. The staff and services are like other movie theaters. Nothing stands out as either good or bad.</Text>

Typical movie theater.  Ticket prices are the same as all of the other theaters.  The location is nice.  There are lots of restaurants near by that are walking distance. If you wanted to do dinner and a movie, this is a good theater to go with.  Parking can be a challenge during peak hours.<//review>

Great theater in downtown San Mateo.   Reservable seating that are gigantic easy chairs with great if you want it.   Good picture and sound.  Full snack bar. Popcorn is freshly made with what appears to be clarifed butter.  Parking in city garage across the street  with elevators.  Free parking after six.< /Text>

The place is nice, with many theaters having reclining seats, the place is pretty tidy. The problem is that if you decide to watch a movie on a Friday or Saturday night, you'll have to get there at least an hour early to buy tickets as even 3 week old movies sell out in no time. Sometimes I save myself the trouble and just go to redwood city's much larger venue.</text>

<Text>Get tickets in advance because this theater is always busy for good reasons: 1). The seats recline and are heated which leads to 2). Less seating 3). Convenient location to get food/dessert before/after the movie.</Text>< pictures>

<review>This is my go-to theater. It's easy to get to with a large parking structure across the street. They are always showing the movies I want to watch with my family. Being in downtown San Mateo they do sell out a show on occasion so be aware and use Fandango to lock in tickets when you're trying to see something really popular. The people who work here are pleasant and helpful. They also keep the theater tidy, which isn't easy with the number of people going through there daily. Nice job.< /review>< pics>

FIrst they don’t allow bags to be in the theater, and they did not make the sign obvious enough for people to know, and they don’t even have a place to hold your bag. The seats are not so clean and there are often trash on the floor which me and my friends always stepped on it. All of the items are overpriced and not in good quality.<//Text>

Decent enough theater, fairly clean, decent variety of concessions (for a chain theater).  However, many of the theaters are too small for the price and it's hard to tell which one you'll be in when you buy a ticket.  I go here because it's close and not terrible, not because it would otherwise be my first choice.  To improve they could let you know theater size when you're looking at movies to go to, they could keep the concessions area a bit cleaner.< /text>

<date>1563083579757<//date><Rate>1</Rate><Review>We came in and bought one glass of beer, one glass of wine and a medium popcorn. I came back 45 minutes later for another glass of wine and was “cut off.” All I said was, “can you help me?” Id like another glass of Sauvignon blanc and if you can pour it in the same glass, that would be great. Thank you!” She scanned my ID, and then told me that I’ve already purchased 3 beverages and that I’m cut off. But was happy to provide me with a free soft drink. Like I was hammered after my first glass of wine. My husband and I were on our first date since having our baby girl who’s now a year old. The employee called over Carlos, the manager. I asked Carlos why I’ve been cut off. Carlos never told me of their alcohol policy. That’s all he kept telling me, “I don’t know, you’ve been cut off.” He couldn’t explain why and simply walked away from me. I asked another employee to call the general manager, Muhammed. And he refunded our tickets, beer, wine and popcorn. But our night was already sour and ruined. He did the bare minimum to rectify the situation. A simple, I’m sorry, there’s no reason you should have been cut off would have fixed the situation. Here’s a glass of wine. This establishment knows nothing about about customer service. Way to ruin a new Mother’s first night out.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Great local theater with upgraded, reserved recliner seating. Clean, friendly staff, and a fun little arcade to play games in hefore the movie. Centrally located in San Mateo with plenty of street parking and a nearby parking structure. Lots of food options nearby if you don't want popcorn and Whoppers.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>the place made us waste our money on boba forcing us to throw it away and make us spend our money on over priced food. i paid $9 on small pack of sour patch and a water. the rude workers were being ageist because we were younger children thinking we were going to sneak in food after we threw it away and told them that.

<Review>FIrst they don’t allow bags to be in the theater, and they did not make the sign obvious enough for people to know, and they don’t even have a place to hold your bag. The seats are not so clean and there are often trash on the floor which me and my friends always stepped on it. All of the items are overpriced and not in good quality.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808f9e709b447777:0xe1ea37ff7912c597</GmapID></record>

Obviously they have a no-bag policy that cannot be found on the ticket or outside the cinema. If you ask whether they can store the bag for you, you will be told ‘you can request a refund’ because they had this ridiculous policy hiding in ‘privacy terms’ for a year and new customers aren’t valued.< /Text>

<text>A nice small town theater.  One of the few I've seen in my life with an outdoor ticket stand.  It has the unfortunate Cinemark concession layout that encourages congestion and spills.

Screens are on the small side.  Seating is in good repair.

<Review>Been coming here since I was in middle school. And not much has changed aside from the furniture and decor. This theater has kept its small town ambience which makes it a great place to bring family and friends for a trip to the movies. Also, centrally located in downtown with great restaurants near by and a (cheap!!) parking structure right next door. The box office sells tickets up to 4 days in advance which the only slight draw back.<//Review><user_name>Jonathan Kong< /user_name></record>

While I was living in Foster City it was the closest cinema, so I used to go there quite a lot. I considered it as a "neighborhood cinema" so I was willing to settle my expectations for the sake of a short drive. Overall it is a nice place, but not the highest quality cinema. Screens are not the largest, seats are not the best, sound was a bit too low in some of the times. Nevertheless, I did like gooing there with my son for a weekend movie.</review>

Comfort seating is an absolute game-changer. That being said parking is tough and this theater is one of the smallest out there.< /review>

This has been our local cinema for the last year, and we've come here about 5-7 times since moving to San Mateo. The cinema itself plays all the latest blockbusters, so the range of fares isn't very extensive if your taste runs to foreign/indie. That said, it is very adequate.

The screens aren't humongous like the Century theaters down in Santa Clara/San Jose.  This makes for a more intimate, albeit less impressive, viewing experience.

One thing that I really dislike is that some of the theaters are situated right next to the Caltrain tracks, so you can hear the trains whistling and running past.<//review>

<Text>It's a nice theater, but the best thing about it is it's location. I like the proximity to downtown bars and restaurants, and the walkability. For a romance movie with your squeeze, budget an extra hour and a half and get cocktails at one of the several bars opening into the same alley as the theater, then walk over for your movie. It's great.< /Text>< time>

Right next to train tracks. If you watch a movie at this cinema your movie will definitely be interrupted every 30 minutes or less by trains passing through. You will hear the train on the tracks and feel the ground move. Clean cinema, but the experience is diminished by the train.< /Text>

The movie theater is pretty nice. There are definitely some good options for concessions.

My one complaint is the popcorn was mediocre. I wasn't too impressed.< /review>

<Text>Great place to catch a flick.  Concession stand is somewhat messy and sticky, but overall, has more than plenty of a selection, from food, candy, drinks, treats, ice cream and more.  And of course, you can count on it all being pricey, so go during a matinee, when at least your ticket is discounted.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Easy to enjoy a movie if you can get tickets. There is a steep charge if you book online.</review>

Since they upgraded the seating to the big roomy recliners, I've been drawn back into the theater to enjoy flicks on the big screen. This is my go to spot for movies.<//Text>

An above average theater in a great location. Popular movies can get a bit crowded at time. So be sure you buy your tickets early. This theater isnt quite as nice as the one in Redwood, but they are comparable.<//Review>

<Review>They finally got recliner seats, but the lobby is crampt, too small and has almost no place to sit down. They have 2 of the recliner seats in the lobby as like samples, but I guarantee some entitled white lady will be in one, on her phone, with her purse in the other one when you get there.<//Review><UserId.>116165479017848280848</UserId.><user_name>Sean Kath</user_name>< Rate>

The movie theater is pretty nice. There are definitely some good options for concessions.

My one complaint is the popcorn was mediocre. I wasn't too impressed.< /text>

It's a movie theater. That's for sure. Parking in the area is tough. The theaters are decently maintained. The movie selection is not daring, standard Hollywood stuff.</Text>

Not one of my favorite theaters for interference from talkative audiences. Tonight's audience included a child using her outdoor voice. This time she was escorted out (I assume by a caretaker), but often it's the teens with their parents who forget that public and home theaters have different etiquette.

Meanwhile, the theaters are now outfitted with loungers and large trays, reminicent of baby high chairs. The whole arrangement makes me think of the hapless humans in WALL-E. New carpet, though, to help us locate our reserved seat.< /Review>

Heads up, and prepare for awkwardness!  The theater has changed the seats to new electric reclining lounge chairs.  Sounds nice, but I'm not sold this is a good plan:  here are my issues: they make a big deal out of assigned seating when you buy your ticket.  This means the ticket purchase line takes THREE TIMES longer to buy your ticket as patrons try and pick seats!  But wait there's more!!!  Once you get into the theater, there are fewer seats and nobody is paying attention to what seat they are supposed to be in so now you have this awkward situation where somebody is in your seat so you sit in another seat and the next person come in wants to know why you are in their seat?  Ok and about cleaning those lounge chairs? popcorn gets stuck down inside ewwgh.  Again it's all new so maybe it will get sorted out but i'm skeptical.<//text>

The new Luxury Loungers are definitely nice seats, and tables are a nice touch, but the seat feeding is narrower and shorter than those at the Century Cinema in Mountain View. The sound of the nearby Caltrain doesn't affect the movie (can't hear it) and it's nice to be at a not crazy crowded movie theatre!<//review>

No IMAX screens, so don't go if you want to see a film better in IMAX (Gravity is one example). It's functional, it's clean, it's a good movie theater.<//Review>< Pics>

Wouldn't let us in with our luggage, like we were carrying entire suitcases full of snacks and drinks. We couldn't even see a movie...

This is the third cinema I have ever brought luggage to before a flight, and this was the first cinema to tell me flat out 'no'.< /review>

<rating>3< /rating><review>I'm making this review as a collab between their Theater, of which I love, and their food, of which I loathe. The theater is great. I love their seats, I think it's one of the more comfortable theaters in the bay area. The food however, was nothing short of disappointment. I'm singling out the 'Super Nachos' I ordered. First off, it took about 15 minutes to put together (joke I not). It consisted of opening up a bag of nacho chips, grabbing sour cream, salsa, and guac from the fridge in their predelivered pouches, and simply dumped on to the chips. Here's the best part. The guac...was SQUEEZED onto the nachos, yes I said squeeze. Take a look at my associated photo. The audacity to call it SUPER nachos and charge me $7!!! Movie was great though. Would still come back. But obviously not make the same food choices I disastrously made on my last visit.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f9e709b447777:0xe1ea37ff7912c597<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Clean, nice staff, though not always an attention to detail. Gentlemen came in with tickets with our seat number but dated 3 days later  Popcorn was mediocre at best. Serves Starbucks but cannot use Starbuck payment method so no credit towards goals.</text>

The bf's company decided to do a movie outing here...and while I wasn't feeling great I had to be the super girlfriend and make an apperance...lol

Let me say I was super impressed!!! Nothing like CLEAN comfortable seats! I also love the the arm rest goes up so you can snuggle up to your date/partner/husband.

Clean lobby!! I am super sensitive to smells and this didn't have any of the usual stale popcorn or cola smells that most theaters have.

I would definetly go back.< /Review>

Parking can be an issue from Fri - Sat. Many restaurants to visit. Seems to be in perpetual renovation.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The cinema is quite stick, electric recliner chair, very comfortable.
The only drawback is that the trailer will be about 30 minutes

(Original)
這個電影院相當棒，椅子是電動的躺椅，相當舒服。
唯一缺點就是，預告片大約會有30分鐘< /Text>
