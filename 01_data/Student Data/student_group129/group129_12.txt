Third time...forget it. I got brisket sliders, and they were completely hard rubbery fat. There was one piece of "brisket" that was so hard and gristled I had to spit it out. It's gotten dirtier each time ive been.
Flat beer, uncaring staff, and food has gotten progressively worse.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Friendly staff, good music from the digital Jukebox. I ordered the club sandwich and was delighted to see thick cuts of meat that look like they came off of a slicer on the thick setting. Veggies were nice and crisp, and the bacon was very crunchy and nice. The bread is  buttered and toasted. This is a nice sized sandwich and I am pleased.  I recommend that you come give the place a try. Good beer selection as well.<//text>

Friendly staff which who aim to please. Food is  delicious. My pancakes were prepared from scratch, like my grandma used to prepare. May take a little longer to get to you, but it is prepared fresh. Have been to the Hidden Tavern and always pleased with food and service.< /text>

Well I don't know how to start, my wife and I both ordered the New Yorker platters which consists of a New York steak two sides and a salad, the salads were really good the steaks on the other hand not so good, more than half of the steaks were fat and they put absolutely no seasoning on the steaks whatsoever this is the first time I've used a steak sauce on a steak in years just to try to give it some type of flavor, it was not cooked to order and I would never recommend this to anybody. I had also ordered the shrimp with my dinner and they were cold although they had good flavor. The drinks are tiny, We will never go back I would not recommend this place to anybody.<//text>

Let me just start off by saying the owners are awesome people they make you feel like family they come out they talk to you see how things are going make sure that you're enjoying your meal. The service is great the food is even better it's all homemade so it takes awhile to get yours your food but let me tell you it is well worth the wait the drinks are on point they're not water down I give this restaurant a five star review.</Review>

Today was our first time at hidden tavern. We thought the food was very good. It was nice and clean. I  was disappointed that at 12:30 they only  served breakfast not lunch. And the cook with the ear plugs and tattoos was drinking at the bar in between orders. But it was very good service and family friendly. We will be back.< /Text>

<Text>Pretty cool little dive bar. $20 all you can drink Friday. Don't know if this is a normal thing but we'll worth it. 25 beers on tap. Fair selection (5 or 6) of bottle beer. Great atmosphere helpful staff. Dead until about 11:30 hen it filled up pretty quick. We DID NOT eat.< /Text><user_name>Mike Gardner<//user_name><UserId.>100322051927129179287< /UserId.><Date>1515828962119<//Date>< Pictures>

We feel for the staff and owners but after witnessing dirty tables and a fellow disappointed customer along with our extended wait for service it's apparent that Hidden Tavern doesn't have what it takes to meet even 1 star.
As a family we remain optimistic that this local establishment can make core and significant improvements that will lead to their success.</Text>

The Server was very nice, however the adults were servered about 5 minutes before our son. How long does it take to make Mac & Cheese??  The whipped cream on my son's dessert tasted like it was straight out of a generic brand whipped cream can.
The BBQ sauce was horrible and the ribs and steak were not good quality meat.
They were really over priced for the quality or lack there of.
We we're anxious to try this place but the interior is exactly like the former place. They used super low end table ware (plastic plates & really cheap silverware) and regrettably the food was not really good. Our  son liked his Mac & Cheese but short of that we were sadly very disappointed.
Not trying to offend anyone, just being honest. Sorry 😣

*****Next morning update: food poisoning for 2 out of 3 of us.  Ugh! 🤢</text>

This is a really great hidden Jewel across from the Super Target in Hesperia. The sports memorabilia and decor and TVs are just amazing .I asked for something healthy today and Gabrielle help me create an awesome protein Burger with tomatoes and cucumbers. When three other people ordered the same thing after they saw mine I told her she had to name it after me and guess what she said she would it will be on the menu soon. Come to the hidden Tavern and have a Donna Burger!< /Review>

This restaurant is AMAZING. This is honestly the best restaurant in the victorvill area. There food is good all out. There staff was very nice and they had excellent service. The food came out fast and I was able to enjoy my food.I loved that there was complementary homemade playdoe at the entrance. This is a nice change instead of crayons and paper for the kids. I highly recommend eating her.<//Review>

The macaroni and cheese the kids ordered was worse than box macaroni from the grocery store. The pork shop that we ordered was so overcooked it was inedible.  And apparently our server said the manager or owner was at the bar drinking.  There were only two or three customers in the entire place and they didn't even bother to come check on the tables or even come and apologize for the horrible food that we had been served.  I would definitely not recommend this place except to recommend that you avoid it at all costs.</text>< pictures>

Our first and last time coming here, waitress was nice but the food is horrible. For the price you pay for a patty melt might as well just go to McDonalds. The bread was not toasted, the meat patty was just a hamburger and did not shape the rye bread so pretty much just got extra bread, and literally got one grilled onion ring. Money not well spent, ($10.50) serving food like that I'm sure this place will not be in business very much longer. We were the only people there as well so I guess that speaks for itself.< /Text>

<review>Poor service. Went into the bar area and ordered food plus drinks. Received our drinks but was never brought our food. After waiting for an hour we told the waitress to cancel our order, she left and we placed a $20 on the table. We walked out got in the car and the owner flagged us down making me stop saying we didn't pay for our drinks. We simply told him we paid but he wouldnt let us leave. DO NOT go to this restaurant!! They dont know anything about customer service. My husband went back in and was told our order barley put in after an hour of us waiting from when our order was taken. That place was empty was we got there so order should have gone in immediately.<//review>< pictures>

The salsa was not what they said. The BBQ burger tasted a cumin burger. So much that you can smell it as they walked up to the table. Food was not appealing at all.</Review>

<Text>We waited almost an hour for our food and there was only about 15 people in the whole place. When the food did come out 2 out of 4 orders where wrong. The food was blandb but the pastrami was the best thing that was ordered. We will try it again and hope that it is better.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Tried to give this place a shot but it was epic fail. Cold food wings seemed like they were made hours before pastrami was disgusting. I will not be back. Beer was warm and service was extremely slow. This place will not last if tbey dont change things up. Way over priced for there quality of food. Big disappointment<//text>

<text>This place looked nice, but the food and service were awful. Although the server was friendly she was totally unavailable.  It took 25 minutes for her to come back and take our order. It took over an hour to get our food and when we did it was awful. I got the bbq chicken sliders, which hardly had any chicken on them at all(and what was on them was overcooked), so it was mostly just a plate of rolls and pub chips, half of which were overcooked and the other half were raw inside. My friend got the chicken tenders which were also dry and overcooked, but the breading on them was gross, it was full of flecks of burned breading and stuff from other things like they don't change out the fryer oil. We couldn't find our waitress to complain and we're starving by the time the food finally came so we just ate as much as we could stomach. Then we sat there for another 20 minutes or so waiting for the check, we never saw our waitress again, I had to go up to the bar and ask the bartender to print out the check for us. After dinner we were still hungry so we grabbed fast food on the way home.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Walked in, waited several minutes for waitress to notice that there was anyone there despite there only being 2 tables being served in the entire restaurant. When we went to order, they were out of the three entreés that my boyfriend attempted to order. Once he finally asked for something that they had, the waitress came back and told us that they were out of that too. We were a little annoyed and instead of being understanding gave us very apparent attitude as if it were our fault. The side salads we got were subpar and it took them 45 minutes to bring us our sandwiches, which were missing the sides of fries. We asked about it and the waitress seemed very irritated. Servings are super small, especially considering the prices, and my sandwich is so soggy I can't even pick it up.  TL;DR overall just don't come here, really annoyed with service and quality of food.</text>

The chef Freedom, has a love of food, and the soups made that day are awesome ( french onion, vegy beef, etc...). Fish and chips had a huge portion of fish moist and tender. The cook made the tarter for us and delivered it to the table as he says "with love". Great service and well lit unlike the othelr dingy sports bars in the area we have been to. We are here for 3 weeks from out of town, and have been looking for a place like this.  Many tv's to watch sporting events. Whatever the sporting event, you can watch it here.  Watch out for other reviews put out by other local bars trying to discourage you for coming here. Try it once and make a decsion for yourself.</Text></record>

The server was ok but definitely IN A HURRY!!!! He was the only one out here, currently there are 7 tables full of people and ONE server.

With that being said, I found something in my drink and he hasnt been back since he brought out my greasy mozzarella bites (which aren't too bad besides the fact being full of dripping grease)

I got a peach "frozen" margarita because they have no drink menu for me to choose a nice drink from so I went with what he recommended. It was good while frozen but as I kept drinking it tasted like pure alcohol and ended up finding something in my drink.

This place has potential.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Food was horrible ordered the sampler and got what resembled old freezer burned chicken wings or was it chicken feet couldn't tell.  Avoid this place unless you just want a beer. Do not eat here service took forever for barely editable chicken feet.< /text>

If you're a fan of bad service rude waitresses and a incompetent manager be sure to visit this location if you actually want to get a beer and get food go to the gas station and get your beer then go to In and Out it'll be a better experience that's what we had to do< /review>

<text>Its a nice place but it would be better if the guy had change .. I try to change a 20 dollar bill and all I needed for drying was 1 dollar I used 3 of the big machines so I wasn't trying to change the bill a take off if the guy can carry some change it would be better.. but overall it's a nice laundromat to come and wash in the day .. at night there's always people in front kinda shady .<//text></record></dataset><record>

Ever since it became sam's the place became way better. The prices are pretty good compared to everywhere else They even have a new Payrange app to pay touch free with which makes it that much better. I hate having quarters or using a card dedicated to one place that I have to keep refilling. No more. Never super crowded that u have to wait for machines...and the washers and dryers are brand new! Plus the place is pretty clean cuz there is this lady I see always cleaning. Also ever since the hookah spot closed down there are no more people hanging out in the parking lot...only wish we could use the wifi.<//Text>

Prices are lower than other laundromats I've been to and it's open 24hrs making it appear very convenient but doesn't seem to have a person watching the place full time, which makes it no so great. That being said..  some of my quarters weren't replaced from a machine that clearly didn't function and half my clothes and blanket I placed in a specific dryer wreaked of urine!
Since I washed late at night it was extremely inconvenient to have to load up again. Had to sleep w/out my blanket and wash that load over again elsewhere, the following day. 👎<//Review>

I was approached by a worker while trying to change a 10$ bill just to get harassed in front of everyone. His attitude was completely uncalled for and completely unprofessional. The last time I do my laundry here.</Review>

$2.25 for a washer , the laundromat looks decent and it’s big enough to wash as many loads as pleased but the price is ridiculous for a small load.<//Review>

Never washed here but I have walked in to see if it was busy and check out the prices. I can’t tell you about the prices because I was to busy laughing at the machines. First thing I noticed was out of all the machines maybe 6 of them were working LMAO!!! now here’s the best part, the machines were from like 1950’s they looked like you had to provide physical work to make it spin like with your foot or something LMAOO!! I have no idea how this place stays open or why people even go there to wash 😂😂😂 I’m sorry I can’t stop laughing at this place. Oh dryers do look like they might work.<//text>

Good local well priced. Danny the manager & Sergio, they are very friendly and helpful. The manager goes out of his way to make the experience excellent.

I brought the car in for slow leaked tire, but they were overwhelmed with a lot of customers.  They asked if I wanted to come back the next day instead of waiting around. Then Danny gave me an appointment for the following morning sharp @ 9am.

The morning came, Sergio brought my car in right away & fixed the tire
It took only 20 minutes in/out.

Definitely will come back for any services

Highly recommend<//review>

<Text>I spoke with Denny the manager about a nail in my tire. He said no problem, $30 to patch. I took my car right over. Denny inspected my tire and asked me if my tire light had come on. No I replied. He said it was a possibility the nail didn't penetrate all the way into the tire. Denny pulled out what turned out to be a short screw, tested the area with water where no bubbling occurred. I was good to go. No charge. I loved his honesty and over the top customer service. Highly appreciated and recommended. Thank you so much!</Text>< pictures>

We were able to make it into the shop, got this taken care of, and very fast.  Drove on, talked to the staff, they took the car, found the issue, trouble shot it, put a new tire on, paid and out the door in about 35
Minutes!

They staff was nice, let me know what was going on and my options.  They let me choose how to proceed but gave me an honest assessment and option!</Review>< Time>

Went here 3 times, had a good experience. As far as i know they got a new owner recently so they have been improving things. Convenient location right in downtown. Pricing is average and they have a good waiting area in the lobby. Work usually done in timely manner and they communicate pretty well. 5 stars from me!< /text>

I was an out-of-tower with a low tire indicator and they quickly checked out my tires and aired me up without a charge.  I left my car with them for the afternoon rather than pay for parking and they were very accommodating. GREAT friendly service even though they didn’t make a dime off me.  I probably won’t do business with them as I don’t live nearby but I recommend the locals to make this place their first stop for service.< /Text>

< review>
Just killed a carne asada super burrito with diabla sauce added inside and let me tell you. I've had burritos all over. As a native californian, I love me a great burrito. This one was definitely delicious! Super fresh ingredients and ACTUALLY SPICY. She warned us it would be super hot to add the salsa inside and it definitely was but I would for sure ask for it again just maybe sauce on the side so I can choose when I want to murder my mouth 😜. The asada wasn't greasy it was perfectly charred, veggies we're fresh, and the sour cream seemed to be strategically placed at the end of the experience to soothe the spice from the sauce. I'm so glad we stopped here and we will definitely be back!<//review>

Totally legit. Amazing pastor, classic Mexican breakfasts like huevos rancheros. Menudo on the weekends if you are into that. Open Sunday! Can’t wait to come back. Salsa bar!</review>

The food is always great. The salsa is the only thing that varies. That could be because of the chilies. Try the tacos or the burrito with TRIPAS WELL DONE,  amazing!<//Text>

I'm use to Fresno where truly amazing Mexican food is around every corner. This is place reminds me of home! Absolutely fantastic shrimp tacos. Fajita burritos and bowls are tasty and filling. Salsa is on point.< /Text>

<Review>Easily the best burrito of my life. It was an emotional awakening. I will absolutely stop here on my way to/from Yosemite. I recommend the jumbo burrito with carne asada and al pastor. We got two of these, and two drinks, for just under $20. Daisy, the cashier, did a lot to help me choose what to order. My girlfriend and I were so tired after hiking for 2 days straight, and driving all night. Daisy was so nice to us, only 20 minutes before closing time. I spoke with Maria today, who was also very friendly. PLEASE tip these amazing people. To the staff, thanks thanks and thanks again!</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Phenomenal in every way- delicious authentic food, friendly attentive service, sparkling clean, comfortable seating. I had the Chile relleno burrito and my partner had the veggie burrito- both were amazing. We tried a half dozen options from the salsa bar and loved them all. We washed it all down with some michelata which did not disappoint. The waitstaff were super polite and checked on us frequently, offering more chips and making sure we were satisfied. This place is a true gem, we will definitely be back again soon.<//Review>

<review>Great authentic Mexican food in a bright, clean and cozy little restaurant. Excellent, attentive and friendly service. We had a carne asada burrito, a super burrito and chicken fajitas, and everything was piping hot and flavorful. It was a great place to eat on a gray, cold and windy day.</review>< Pics>

It's been like 25yrs since I've been to the outdoor swapmeet. There are so many things too buy I was in a hurry so I didn't get too walk the entire meet. I will definitely go back as soon as I'm able.<//Text>

<text>Coachella INDOOR SWAP MEET is a one stop shopping place. With the advantage that's indoor and there's A/C. You could find pretty much everything such as beauty supplies, clothes, candy store,  shoe store, restaurant, jewelry store, bikes and so many more things. And lets not forget the bridal store where you can order your wedding dress or have it custom made.< /text>< pictures>

Chio is the best at Franklin Storage Pro. She has been helpful flexible and always on point. I think that she should be the president of Storage Pro and and deserves a  $1 million raise per month.  I will forever be with Storage Pro because of Chio And the reasonable rates at Storage Pro.  I looked for more affordable rates other storage companies but was unable to find them. I recently moved to Sacramento and realized that my storage unit at Storage Pro and Oakland on Franklin is the best at $15 per month. And Chio helped me to realize that and keep my storage in Oakland. Thank you Chio.
Sincerely,
Jeremy F.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Look, we all are going to need a storage locker or even a room at one time or another in our lives. This is a cool converted old building near BART and with a couple of garage spaces and street spaces for loading/unloading. If parking is really tough there's a paid garage around the corner.

Staff was uniformly friendly in my experience.

Only negatives
* I received an email from the company urging me to vote against a particular ballot measure that was active at the time of my rental. I viewed this as unethical from a business relationship perspective.
* Billing/account system is a little clunky in terms of interface

Overall good experience and would recommend.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Super helpful, quick and knowledgeable staff. Everyone was super upfront about the cost even though I found and reserved the unit via a third party on the internet. The staff was kind and respectful of covid space...we were in and out in 20 mins, and I had my paperwork in hand and also emailed to me. Be aware, hours open to access your storage and office hours may be different. 10/10 would recommend and use again.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1596937599381, 'text': 'Jessi , we are so happy to hear that we could accommodate you and provide a smooth rental experience.

<time>1580681702391< /time><rating>1</rating><review>The only reason I gave it the one star is the management was friendly and helpful. But no parking. Major issue with the parking. They built more storage units inside and took away the indoor parking and you can only get two or three vehicles in at a time otherwise you're stuck trying to find a spot on the street and good luck with that. And this is the first one star I've ever given :-(. Mainly because of the greed Factor taking away the indoor parking for more storage units. But not thinking or caring about the hassle the customers will have to go through trying to load or unload or get to their unit.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The team at Storage if Oakland really try their best to offer a good storage environment.  One that's clean, safe and somewhat affordable.  Keep up the good work.</Review>

<Name>RN Bill Pay - Accounts< /Name><Date>1571227469517<//Date><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Chio is an excellent manager of this facility; she was extremely helpful and accommodating.  I had a very stressful move scheduled where I was flying in/out in the same day.  She checked-on us the entire day, and went above “Her Purview of Duty”.  My belongings were there for (5) five consecutive years, and I retrieved everything in excellent condition.

The only negative is this facility has limited parking, and I do not recommend any type of POD move.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Not only is it a good location and easy to access, but the staff is super nice!

< Review>
I was at a different location, where I rented a small cubicle for $50 a month, the hinges were about to fall off , doors were of old wood. But having seen the size I needed at storeage pro and the coated cement flooring , roll down door, which is well worth the rent for my needs.< /Review>

Wish you guys would stop going up on the rent, I've been with you for many years. Although Jason is excellent person no complaints there. The rent is crazy, I hope to make the situation better by moving out ASAP it's a process BUT I'm truly working on it.</Review>

<Text>This company does not have people in the office at the stated times, does not answer phones or return voicemails and will not be available if you have problems. They will continue to charge you for your unit, even after vacating, and are never available to discuss the issues you have. If you like paying for something you are not using and having no form of communication with your rental company, then rent here! Seriously, I am using this to try to communicate with the company because they will not return my calls...

I'd like to preface this review by stating that I've rented space at 5 different storage locations in San Francisco in the past without issue... When I first contacted this company to rent a unit, I was offered a promotional price for the first month. I spoke with the company over the phone and was told that my price would last for one month from the signing date - I payed my $50 promotional price at that time... and was charged $250 three days later on the first of the month. The company refused to honor the promotional price I was quoted with over the phone and did nothing to remedy the situation. So fine, I paid my charge and told the company to terminate my agreement and received confirmation that they had done so. Flash forward to two week ago, I received a notice that the property in my unit (which is empty) had been seized and I would need to pay two months of rent. The company will not return any of my calls to discuss the issue and so now I am sitting here with a $450 court order and nobody to speak to. There is something wrong here, don't bother renting with this company.</Text>< Rating>

I rented here in the past, and when I return to Oakland in the summer this place will be the first place I visit to store my belongings again. Highly recommend<//review>
</record></dataset><record>
<Review>Used to love StoragePro (previously Devon Storage) for it's location and it's secure indoor units, but I share Victoria's frustration at the rent increases. I've compiled my rent-increase notifications, and will call as was suggested to Victoria. I negotiated a specific rate when I chose the location and unit, and even allowing for rising costs, I don't think the increases are justified. I'm also concerned they will just keep coming.<//Review>< Pics>

After doing a little research online to find a storage location that was convenient to me,  I stumbled acrossed the StoragePRO, and thought this is absolutely perfect and was excited to make the call to start the process.  I called the OAK location, a gentleman answered and I started asking my questions and waited for his reply, and waited, and waited, thinking at this time he might have said please hold, that maybe I just didn’t hear him say.  To my surprise, the call disconnected.  I call back being that I know these things happens sometimes. I call and this time a female answered, never once did she state the business name, and then proceeded to say hello, can I help you. I asked if this was StoragePRO, she replied yes, I asked if this a professional place of business, i call a moment ago and was disconnected, she said yes-how may I help you, disregarding anything I just shared.  Horrible Horrible.<//review>

<Review>Their access hours are restrictive and there is basically no parking on the street. I saw prices that were almost half the cost at other places but only went with this one because of a sale price on a storage unit that they didn’t even honor when we actually signed the contract but I was desperate.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Sawed our lock off without telling us. Never here! They take 3 hour lunch breaks and we can't even get into our own storage because they keep their own locks since they sawed ours off... This place is unprofessional and kind of a joke ...

Fantastic, ginormous sandwiches. Feeds for two days easily. Tons of quality ingredients and great options. Staff is friendly and chatty.
Only thing holding this from 5 stars is that I've asked for no pickles three separate times and gotten an absurd amount of pickles instead.<//text>

Love this picture framing shop! I took some of my collection of art work to this shop to have cleaned up and framed, the owner was so helpful and really nice. He really took his time with me... to help with ideas and the prices were responsible. Highly recommended!👌👍</Text>

<Review>I actually loved my sandwich on Thursday! First time coming here. A little back story my company sent sandwiches on a weekend from a gourmet shop in the area, of course via Door Dash and for some reason the driver didn’t understand when I asked “Where were these made?”🤷🏽‍♀️ Nevertheless I have been on the hunt for the one sandwich named Thanksgiving 😍 Although this is not the shop I found my sandwich delicious so I returned on Friday for the Rattler. Well big disappointment. The lady fixed my sandwich on Thursday (the Dutch Crunch photo). The Rattler was prepared by male who took my order the previous day as well as Friday. So, $22 dollars is my limit. I will never give my hard earned money away to a business whom are not consistent and can barely hide their disdain for my presence.<//Review><rating>3<//rating>< username>

Considering the quality and the size of the sandwiches, wait time, and cost I would rank it as a 4 star. It's not the cheapest one but here is why I am giving this local business a 5 star: The owners attitude towards customers. Go there and see what I am talking about.<//text>

< Review>
We wanted to try another restaurant on the block but they were not open so we walked over to Bonne Sante and glad we did.  Large sandwiches.  I got the Wrangler burger on Dutch crunch.  It was really good, but the Dutch crunch got to me in the end and was a little too much chewing.  So soft roll next time.  The girl at the counter told use the fries were not big enough to be shared by 2 people, but they are.  My friend got the pizza roast beef, forget the name but it looked good and she liked it a lot.  If I was in the area more often I would make this a regular spot.< /Review>

Mouth-wateringly good sandwiches! If you're looking to get a XXL sandwich, complete with all of your favorite toppings (plus a few unconventional choices that you'll end up loving) at an affordable price, Bonne Sante is where you need to go for your next lunch!

I ordered a turkey on ditch crunch after the owner suggesting it was the best. It was terrible. 17 dollars and it was inetiable. I threw it out. A half a can of cranberry dressing on top of salty processed Turkey. Roll was soggy and doughy.  RIP off!< /review>

Big, tasty sandwiches for good prices! I can't ever finish the whole thing so I save a half for later. I like their BBQ burger in particular. My s.o tried the BLT sandwich but didn't like it as it was too bready (not enough stuff on the inside). No table service and they give you your order wrapped in paper to go, even though we were eating in. It's hot inside so I wish they had a water dispenser like some of the other shops on the street.< /review>

I was at a six-hour meeting where sandwiches from Bonne Sante were served for lunch. I had a roast beef with cheese and thousand island dressing. Really tasty. We had expected several more people than attended (illness). There were leftovers, which several of us carted away. That evening, I had a ham and cheese (well, half; I saved the other half for lunch). Sumptuous. Plenty of meet inside those sandwiches. Best outside-of-the-home sandwiches I've had in years.<//text>

Large portions at a reasonable price while maintaining very high quality. Bread is serious here. They don't mess around. Burgers and sandwiches both great.</Review>

You could bludgeon someone with these sandwiches- they definitely don't skimp out. However, this is not a place that emphasizes quantity over quality. Outstanding ingredients and everything always tastes fresh. Be sure to try the Dutch crunch bread. Personal favorites are the meatball and the prosciutto con pollo.</Text>

Everytime I walk into Bonne Sante, I am greeted with courtesy and a nice willingness to serve me. They make it easy and I like easy and fast. I usually order the Vegetarian Sandwich with Mushrooms just to get my fix of protein and they heat up the mushrooms and that rocks. Now; if I am going to be forth-right here; I plan on only eating 1/2 now and 1/2 at dinner, but we all know that is pure BS. Just prior to the last bite of the first 1/2  I begin the rationalizing about how it is OK to finish it off or just take a couple bites of the second 1/2 sandwich. Nope; there it goes..before long the second 1/2 is gone. It's out-of-here. What a dog I am.. Thanks guys...we love you and we will be back.< /review>

<review>As good as it gets indeed! Bonne sante has a good selection and variety of delicious and immense  sandwiches. Like seriously, you will be full after just eating the first half. Oh did I mention that all sandwiches are under 9 $ ! That's lunch and dinner for 9$!!

I tried so far the Santa Fey, The prosciutto and the top sirloin. Hard to decide which one is my fav. They were all delicious!

I would definitely keep coming back here again!< /review></record>

Big awesome sandwich with lots of fresh ingredients and freshly sliced meat. Burger sandwiches are a bit soggy however and maybe not as tasty.< /review>

<text>One of my favorite places to indulge in a sandwich that is big enough for 3 meals. Everyone there is so friendly, and I love their mango-passionfruit-chocolate chip cookies.<//text>< Rating>

Want Avacado, you get a whole one, a half on each side. 2 meals in one and their Fries for $1.25 is great, plus they also  have Burgers that are just as big and good. Hottie, Napa, and island Burger are on hit.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

<Review>I had the best experience with Dr Dean today. He patiently explained what was going on with my oral health and gave me his plan of action, which calmed my nerves as I was really nervous. He took the time to explain everything to me in layman’s terms, and I did not feel rushed in and out of the office, like I normally do, every time I’ve been to a doctor! Thank you for everything and I will be referring all my friends and family members to you from now!</Review><GmapID>0x80dcd97c2030064b:0xff580d538eba4473<//GmapID><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1624635098816, 'text': 'Sal, thank you for sharing about your visit in our Aava Dental Santa Ana office.

<Text>I have received dental and medical care from some of the most prestigious facilities in the world and I have NEVER received care and treatment as good as I did today. Angela at the front desk, Dr Weber and her assistant Denise were all very professional and very kind and considerate to me. I loved my visit.

We received a promotional flyer from Aava Dental because he is a union member. I asked my husband to "check it out" since I am petrified of dentists. He went to Aava Dental in Foothill Ranch where he met the fabulous Dr. Weber, Angela, and Rebecca. He was very happy, his experience was positive, and he was confident that I would have the same experience.

I called Aava Dental in Foothill Ranch and spoke with Angela.  Angela allayed my fears and eased my mind as to what to expect. In addition, there were so many positive views on Google.  I had some intermittent molar pain and I needed a cleaning as well.  I went to the Santa Ana location. As soon as I walked in I was warmly greeted by Angela. I met Rebecca who took my xrays and walked me through the process.  Then, there is Dr. Weber, who is THE BEST DENTIST I have ever had in my life.  I thank God for her.  I am in my early 50's so that is saying a lot. It turned out I had five cavities and my cleaning was easy. Dr. Weber and her staff know I am a "chicken" when it comes to being in that dental chair and being worked on.
Here is a comprehensive list of what I went through.  It's also the little things that mean so much.
-Verbal welcome greeting from every person. Office was decorated with fall season theme
-Your name is on a welcome board (Welcome Sandra!). My husband had that also
-Top of the line X-ray machine where you stand and the machine "talks" to you while taking images of your teeth
-Gentle inserts of x-rays of your mouth
-While in the dentist chair you can request your kind of music to make you relaxed
-Goggles for your eyes so I can feel protected
-Dr. Weber tells you exactly what she will do.  She is gentle and comforting when she had to numb me. My oral cavity does not get numb quickly so I was numbed the maximum number of times. She is so gentle, had so much patience, and professional!
-There were pictures of my lovely cavity-filled teeth.  I recognized my teeth immediately! She described what happens if cavities don't get treated.  She was really fast when treating the cavities.
-She explained what teeth are and how to care for them
-They talk while working on your teeth so there is distraction that your mouth open and teeth are worked on
-She explained that I may have a traumatized nerve on my molar. There was no major cavity on that tooth and we narrowed it down to what it may be.
-Rebecca was very gentle with that suction tube.  (Other dentists I had been to would stick that tube and poke the inside of my mouth harshly)
-There is a detailed list of charges that you get at the end of your visit.  None of that "surprise" billing that you get from other dental practices.

I personally like that this is an all female staff.  To me, it's way different than having a male dentist and female staff.
I highly recommend Aava Dental Santa Ana and Foothill Ranch with Dr. Weber, Rebecca and Angela!< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dcd97c2030064b:0xff580d538eba4473</gmap_id>< rating>

<Review>I loved the staff. Since the beginning Leilani (office manager) made us feel comfortable. I brought my 3 year old and their was activities and children shows for her. Kaliana was the assistant that helped my daughter and I, and she was great. Dr. Weber had so much patience with my little one, and made me feel safe. Overall I will be going back and taking my children. Lovely people, clean environment and great service.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I am in awe at the amazing customer service and professionalism at this office. Dr. Abraham treats his patients like one of his own family. To them we as patients always come first! This is no regular dentist office! They'll take care of your teeth, make you laugh and make you feel at home. I’m never going anywhere else! Thank you Monica, Elizabeth and everyone there! I can’t wait to go back</review>

I've been in the dental field for 18 years and have never seen an office like this. Patient care is absolutely first priority with this company. They give paraffin hand wax to each patient as a courtesy and free lifetime bleaching! Dr. Doca is friendly and takes his time to educate all patients. I'm definitely bringing my family and friends here!

The culture is amazing and so supportive. I've never worked for a company like this and I'm so proud to work for Aava Dental. I love the inspirational quotes Dr. G shares with us in meetings. I always pass at least one to a friend or family member. At Aava we learn how to enjoy life and do our best. I'll be here until I retire</text>

Thank you so much for the prompt appointment. Excellent service and so comfortable. Clean area. Cookie the receptionist is an all around help and great service. Julie is so friendly and attentive to details especially to my daughters. Well what can I say to our Dentist Maria Rhodora, awesome. Well informed, well educated, friendly and exceptional professional service. My family will be here from now on. Thank you again Aava. Well recommended.<//Text>

Friendliest staff ever.
We were squeezed into schedule as an urgent appointment.
I was scared my son would not cooperate but because the Doctor is so nice and gentle, my son and I did great! 😜

I love this office the staff is warm and friendly, Monica is amazing, she explained everything to me from the exam to the payment breakdown. My kids both LOVE the Dentist Dr Tu she was very sweet and comforting. Bonus they give paffian treatments to their patients and I recived one while I waited for my kids. 5 stars!!!! I've found the best dentist office ever.<//review>

They accommodate my busy schedule by fitting me in after I get off work, even when I show up late.  I reffered my wife to the Aava Dental office in Santa Ana, and she also loves them.

This is now our family dentistry. My daughter said to me on our way home from our appointment that she now likes the dentist, but then she added "only if its this same dental office" Best staff and customer service.</text>< gmap_id>

This is the best dental office we have ever gone to.  Dr. Capiral and her staff are the best!  Just got done redoing 2 crowns and she knew I did not want to do it because I was super anxious and nervious.  They took their time and were so kind to me.  They even offered me a paraffin wax for my hands.  Monica, the office manager was super helpful and none of them are pushy.  We are so happy with AAVA Dental!<//Review>

This is one of my favorite places to eat. Everyone who knows me knows that I'm extremely particular. It's very difficult for me to eat out because I won't spend money on anything that isn't better than I could make myself. this restaurant uses only the most high quality ingredients. They're a little bit more expensive but they're absolutely worth every penny. The service is amazing. The food is amazing. The atmosphere is amazing. I only wish that Rio Vista would have allowed them to open here. But it's worth the 10-minute drive!< /review>

Generous portion size. Loved the garlic bread. Calamari portion was substantial, however I thought it was very pale for being fried. Did live the dipping sauce that went with it. Will go back to try other dishes again. Finally a great restaurant  in Isleton and Rio Vista.</Text>

Google, yahoo, Barrizza’s own website showed 7 pm  closure on Sunday nights...... makes sense for food....or the weekend... or a restaurant. “ No, we close at 6 on Sundays... we’re closed.”   Sure we have folks still eating on our patio as our covid ads provide. Sure our website says 7.  Call ahead.... like we did... but don’t expect any Grazi there either. Tough Luck vibe from no Grazi staff.</Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Name>Diane McLean</Name><Review>I ordered online today, August 6, 2020. I was told I would receive a text when ready about 15 minutes. Never got text. Dinner was sitting in the kitchen when I went in to see if ready. When I provided payment, he took my card and went out to the patio. By the time I got my dinner, drove one mile to get home, my burger bun was soggy and cold, the fries were hard and cold. Not a very good experience for $15.00. This is not the first or second time the customer service was lacking. Next time think Rio Vista sounds better. Dissatisfied Customer.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>2</rating><text>Im a local and unfortunately have never had a satisfying visit yet. The first time was a few weeks after opening. Me and my family were seated on the paito. 45 minutes later no one had even taken our drink orders yet. I asked a waitress and she told me we will get there eventually. I waited 10 min more then our group of 6 left.  I told the hostess why we were leaving and she just said "okay bye".

Few months later i gave them another chance. The food was over cooked and the waitress didnt seem to care at all.

Then i gave a third try two weeks ago with a togo order. I got home and both my burger and chicken sandwich was burt to a crisp 🤦‍♂️.

I love supporting local businesses here in isleton.  but i dont think my family will be back for a long time unfortunately.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<name>Bernie V< /name><Text>It's atmosphere is unbeatable. The town of Isleton is quite liberating in the sense of no town government. One can be peacefully free here and go to the river for some Island activity. As for the restaurant, the menu will soon change in the upcoming month(s) and will be that of a movie like restaurant with inspirations of Mexican, Italian and Cali cuisine and it's in the Delta of California which gives it access to countless ingredients grown locally and organically. The staff will treat you like family, as we are all one giant conciousness family. Doesn't matter race, species or gender.<//Text>< Rating>

I came into this place when I was just about 39 weeks pregnant, asking them if they had the PREGO PIZZA. In which they did not but instead of offering me another pizza, they made the PREGO pizza and within three days of eating that delicious pizza. I had my baby on 02/09/2020 Sunday! Thank you Manny’s!< /text>

After your call, management inspected the gallon of Tropicana where your juice was poured from and we can assure you that the orange juice you took was not an alcoholic beverage and the only explanation we can offer is that the gallon was not mixed well before pouring or it had started to ferment.  During these challenging times due to COVID-19, our beverage products are not moving as quickly as normal since we are closed for table service and this gallon of Tropicana may have been sitting on the shelf longer than it should.\n\nI can assure you that we are taking the proper precautions, we have educated our staff on the matter and for the time being, we have transitioned to the use of individual/personal orange bottles with a cap and seal.   I'm glad you were able to notice our mistake in time. I hope you choose to come back and give us a chance to make things right!\n\n-Best, MB's Management team"}< /resp><review>Went into Manny's for breakfast went to go give the kids the orange juice thank God i took a sip it was a mimosa check your drinks before giving them yo your kids.</review>< gmapID>

On the afternoon of 5/30/21 - my sister-in-law, a resident of Isleton, and I (Pacifica) went to this fine eating establishment which she was already familiar with.  We first chose a table outside and the waiter was so kind to bring over an umbrella to shade us from the sun it being 96°,  however, we then decided to move inside to eat and also order to-go.  We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay at the waiter’s suggestion instead of 2 glasses and then ordered fried calamari to share while we waited for our to-go selections.  The calamari was delicious, crispy and prepared perfectly; my only suggestion would’ve been to serve with Aioli sauce as their accompanying sauce was hot!  Waiter brought us 1,000 island for dipping which was a friendly alternative.  We left the restaurant with a small Polpetta pizza, large house salad, garlic bread, and a large Mediterranean pizza.
Back at the house - my Polpetta pizza had the most perfect fresh crusty bite and the meatballs/cheese - red sauce - topping was delish!!!  The best.  I had a slice of their Mediterranean pizza and that was also so delicious.  (Check their menu .). I left for home with my leftover pizza plus a couple slices of their Mediterranean selection and several slices of the garlic bread. The  garlic bread was Yummy - big slices.  My Polpetta pizza was great for dinner the following evening - just as fresh coming out of my oven after a quick rewarm!
Look forward to again visiting this restaurant that my Isleton family has enthusiastically raved about.  The waiter was so kind, patient, professional (thank you!) as we struggled to make our decision of what to order from the plethora of interesting, yummy choices on their menu.<//text>

The mashed potatoes had the consistency of a thick gravy, the turkey was pretty small bite size portions and a small serving. They placed the toast on top of this so I ended up spooning that out. The one rating I'm giving this is too high.<//review>< Pictures>

The thick bacon was amazing. Their hasbrowns are always the best. This place is always good. The only thing was we asked for the butter to be softened and they melted it all the way. Like really?  Cold and hard as a rock butter trying to spread it on pancakes doesn't work.</review>

< review>
Went in today around 10am, the 1st server (man) dropped coffee all over the table, didnt clean it. Brought us our drinks, took our order. Another party came sat next to us their server (lady) was very friendly, took their order and they even left before us! We on the other hand, waited a while for our food, got a new server apparently(man) never checked on us I had to ask the lady server if she could give me a box and how could I get my check. She brought the box quickly. Honestly needs to provide better service or train there servers better. By the way we were there for my brother graduation (so was the opposite table/same size group) breakfast shoulda gone elsewhere!</review>

We love pancakes 🥞 but they did not have social distance and it was at full capacity very busy. The stake omelet had a few pieces inside and no flavor and lots of hashbrowns inside!!</review>

Foods ok but I’m more concerned about how they are handling operations during the pandemic. Communal syrup and hot sauce bottles on the table which aren’t wiped down between guest seatings. Tabled very close together without shields. Seems some basic steps are missing. Blocked fire exit with seats....the fire inspector side of me is cringing.</Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><rating>4< /rating><Text>Stopped in to grab a bite to eat after running errands.  Ordered the Vacon Sensation Omelette with Pancakes🥞.

Due to Post Pandemic climate, condiments aren't readily available so, don't forget to ask for desired items.  Understandable but still a little annoying because if you forget to ask for something, you'll may have a wait getting the attention of the server.

This IHOP is in a good location but the Management should rethink the interior design/layout because it's pretty tight that present a problem with the flow of traffic all around with servers putting the final touches on dishes,  Associates trying to maneuver to bust tables, customers trying to pay, customers entering and exiting...too tight and congested especially with the Cashier Station right in the same area.

Food was nice and hot, I typically request hot syrup for my Pancakes🥞 because there have been times when the cooks finish the Pancakes and they end up sitting on the counter.

Now, IHOP was a staple for our family👪 so I miss the true original fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes.  Not sure if the recipe changed over the years (I'm sure it has) but their definitely not fluffy through and through, a little hard along the edges.  They usually come apart when lifting to butter the individual pancake so, I focus on the center portions and call it a wrap.

A decent experience but the downside for me is the configuration of the space to create a more fluid and unpedded traffic flow.

took my 9 year old boys to eat here. we were able to eat inside during these covid times. one of my son started saying he was feeling weird that he can't explain and said he needed fresh air and felt better after going outside. I don't know what claustrophobic feels like but this sounds like it. after going back inside I did notice where it seems like there is no ventilation. I could be wrong and didn't see it but wanted to point it out in case anyone has that problem. Also large Oj for 5 dollars? I dunno about that. 3 dollars seems more reasonable but that's just my opinion.</Text>

Need a quick bite and it's Saturday night. Everywhere we stopped 30min to hour wait. Stopped here and didn't expect much. There was no wait and the food came out hot and pretty quickly. It was a good choice for a quick late night meal.
Not fancy it's a diner. Open 24hours.< /Text>

A nice IHOP, a little small but cozy, the service was good, the foos was good.. the pancakes were pretty dry even after a lot of syrup. If I wasn't so hungover, I would of enjoyed it much more. 2 people, one chicken fried steak and the other order was the sampler of breakfast (I think) 2 coffees and one orange juice.. like $50 something bucks.. almost $60 😬</Text>

Fabulous location for an IHOP. The food is good and is prepared the same at all the locations. I have two major complaints! One is they allow homeless people in their bathrooms and to wander around the restaurant. I'm sorry but when I'm sitting down to pay $40 for a breakfast I could make at home for $10 I do not expect the smell of urine walking by me and the bathrooms to be soiled. My second complaint is that I ordered a lemonade drink and it looked like water but cost me $6.00. No refills. Our service was good and there was no wait to be seated. #LOCALGUIDES< /text>

<Text>Disclaimer: This visit occurred in September of 2020 during Covid-19. Food was good. Pricy for 2 people (came out to about $40). But it was better than I expected during covid-19. There have been other restaurants I went to where the quality of food went down. We did sit indoors as opposed to outdoors. Would go again.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Rating>

This IHOP was a real nice restaurant. It was clean and it had plenty of friendly, helpful staff. The menu has a variety of items that all appealed to me. I settled for a turkey sandwich. My order was taken right away and the food arrived fast, fresh and delicious. It's located near Knott's Berry Farm, yet there was no wait for seating. There's plenty of free parking.<//Text>

<Text>We were seated quickly.  Our server came quickly and took our drink orders.  He was very patient in letting us decide what we wanted. We never felt rushed.  The food came out quickly, correctly, and hot!  The server even laughed at my very bad Dad jokes.  My wife and I will definitely be going back soon.< /Text>< user_id>

The only thing I find 5 star here is the Guest Service. The food was alright and the coffee is overpriced for the quality, tastes like sink water and of course the water itself is the same. I personally have tasted better for this price range.</review>

<Review>DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT TO BE CHARGED 3X.  We came as a large party of 14.  The server, Oseas, did not provide an itemized receipt.  When requested, we noticed there were several charges that should not have been there.  Instead of refunding the difference, this server charged my card a second time for the corrected amount.  After double checking my bank account, I found that he actually charged the first incorrect amount twice.  So, I'm here on a trip to Disneyland with my kids and $700 is pending in my bank that I cannot use.  There was no manager available and contacts with corporate and franchise owners did not go anywhere.  This is an establishment that will let untrained servers run the restaurant alone, and when something goes wrong not even an apology or single shred of customer service.  Absolute worst customer service.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dd2be724e27377:0x389ee1874ff7148a< /GmapID></record>

<text>Love coming to this specific IHOP always have the best service. I've gone to other IHOPs not the same as this one in bueno park. The server Alma was always on top of everything made sure everything went smoothly and made sure our food came out in a timely manner. She was funny and made our experience so pleasant. Ask for Alma she amazing.</text>< Pics>

We went on Halloween at 8:30. The food was good but there was only 1 waiter so he only came once to see if we needed anything, noone got drink refills even though some were out of water. We waited over 10 min for check but he never came so we had to go to the front and ask for it.<//Review>

Our waitress Anita was phenomenal! She was attentive, quick and polite. The food was good. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because my fries came to me warm and not hot like I prefer them.< /Text>

<review>This IHOP is not a good one. It’s a pretty small location so the wait is unbearable sometimes! Even after you sit down and order you wait much longer than other IHOP locations. We don’t go to this location anymore. Apart from the wait the food is good!<//review><UserId.>111498649974584631089< /UserId.><GmapID>0x80dd2be724e27377:0x389ee1874ff7148a<//GmapID><user_name>Annie Gabricht<//user_name><Resp>None</Resp></record>

A quaint little iHop with great staff and service, near a famous theme park. Lunch crowd is no match for their fast and efficient service! We got a table during a busy Sunday noon in 10 to 15 minutes top. We were a little worried because there were a lot of people waiting and this branch has limited seats. Still they managed to seat our family and served our food quickly with a smile. Our fave place to dine when we're at Buena Park Boulevard. Thank you, iHop staff! Have a Merry Christmas.< /text>

We dropped in for late lunch and we were all very happy with the meal.

From the moment you walk in you are welcomed with a friendly smile which made us feel welcome. The restaurant itself isn't huge but the service is good.

The food came out as we all expected and everyone was satisfied not just with the food but the service and overall experience.< /text>

Free refills on everything, like chocolate milk and orange juice... except milkshakes.

Excellent service and really good food in an classic pancake house atmosphere. The price was more in the "amusement park" range due to being right outside Knotts Berry Farm, but kids eat free after 4:00 so that helps a little.< /Review>

Haven't been to a Ihop in a long time and now I remember why. Food is never that good and the service is terrible. Waiter took a co-workers plate before she was even done eating. He never even asked just took it.<//review>

This IHOP is small in size, but not in service.  We ate here twice during our visit to Knott's.  The service was fast and super friendly.  The good was hot and good.  The portion sizes were great.  Highly recommend this IHOP.< /text>

Great Outstanding service I needed to use their Wi-Fi and they were nice enough to give me access so I could work while I ate. Blueberry Pancakes were better than my dream of them.
Great afternoon lunch bite vet away.

<review>What a worthless restaurant this IHOP is. Enter the restaurant and I am seated by a server. He ask what I wanted to drink. I said coffee. He said he would be right back with the coffee. 10 minutes later a different waiter walked up to my table. He said you want chocolate milk and a chocolate milkshake. I said no, the other waiter just took my order when I sat down. He should be bringing my drink. He walked away. 15 minutes later a third server walked up to my table. He now informed me that he was my server. He was the same waiter that was standing at a table edge 7 feet from me, picking up food off a plate with his fingers and sticking them in his mouth. Lick his fingers off and pick up another piece of food. How grossly inadequate the training is for the staff. The cook was putting foiin his mouth and also using his fingers. I have forwarded pictures of this to the health department.< /review>< Pictures>

The restaurant is small, if you don't mind kids then I say go ahead and come here. The food was good, the servers were nice but again because it's small and the Knott's groups go there the service can be a little slow.</Review>

<text>My parents have took me to many many restaurants and this is by far the worst restaurant it is very small. it’s so hard to get to your table the cooks have to wait there turn to cook the food the food was also very  bad it took forever to get the food to our table they probably bumped into someone in the kitchen the pancakes were cold the toast was hard the cheese wasn’t even melted but I do have a recommendation for them they should give there place to Knotts Berry Farm for extra parking.<//text>< Pictures>

One of the standard cramped (1960-70s) coffee shop building layouts. Lots of late-night company in this joint, while many attend the nearby Knotts Scary Farm. Looks like the menu has recently been updated.<//Review>

Waitress was nice. When I got my food my over easy eggs were really runny, when I got my orange juice there was lipstick on the cup. 75 dollars for 4 people. Didn't have time to take a picture really disgusted. Food came out really quick when we ordered 5 minutes later the food came out. Silverware was dirty creamers were hot and alot of more things Never AGAIN. Dont come here.< /review>

Service was great and fast.. Very clean and restrooms were clean as well.. Food was delicious and hot just how I like it.. My server was an older man who was very nice and had a great attitude.. What I loved the most was after placing my order my 3year old son food was served very fast within minutes it felt.. My service was on point.. I would most definitely come back.</review>

The pancakes/breakfasts are the best choice, always very good!
Some of the dinner items look and taste like they came from the freezer and were thrown together.< /Review>

This restaurant is almost across the street from Knott's Berry farm.  The food was great and the service was great but I was surprised by the prices a little bit..  Everything was about double a normal IHOP menu price...  I had an omelet and a cup of coffee and my bill was $22.  So if you are in a tourist area just be prepared to spend a little more.  Buena Park is a great place to vacation... Not only do you have Knott's Berry farm but there is also a medieval times theater there and also a pirate ship experience which could be fun for the family.</text><pics>None< /pics><Rate>5< /Rate>< userid>

And we never would've been introduced to IHop if a good friend of my mom's from church hadn't invited us. But when we entered, I was almost instantly on love the smell of brealfasty, delicious, mouth watering breakfast. The pancakes and waffles were HUGE. :0. My brother and I ordered the Big Brunch and the housemade chocolate milkshake with extra extra whipped cream, while my mother ordered the strawberry banana pancakes with coffee. Let me say it was one of the best breakfasts we had all eaten. We will definitely return. Thanks so much, IHop.<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

They need to teach their new employee basic hygiene such as handwashing after touching the money at the register immediately before touching the food, and teach them NOT to put the food or drinks next to the register where other customers try to reach the money over the food or drinks (unsanitary).</review>

Much more choices but still over priced breakfast choices!  Sticky tables.  The restaurant looks good on the outside but semi the seats and tables can be pretty sticky. Saw one small bug on the table.  Prices needs to calm down... way too high for the food.<//review>

Had a lovely breakfast with my mom. We've been dining here for over a decade. The regulars know us and treat us like family, no joke. They know our orders and make sure my mom's coffee never runs out.<//Review>

Probably one of my favorite IHOPs because of the great customer service. I never have to ask for a refill and the cooks always deliver. One of our favorite stops after Knott's also because it's eat free 4pm-10pm!< /review>

This IHOP has been here for years small but clean and updated. Great location and a great alternative for meals when visiting Knott's Berry Farm or the other attractions around. Small parking lot so you can park next door. Service and food are XLNT, check it out 👍<//review>

Quick and tasty breakfast spot. There is limited seating however so expect a 10-15 min wait if you arrive after 9am. Same standard of other ihop locations. Convenient next to Knotts if you are going to visit the theme park.</text>

$0.60 Short stacks on 60th Anniversary, (2 days ago), tasted just as good as regular price! Oh the syrups - Strawberry, Blueberry, Boysenberry, and the original Maple syrups to drizzle thinly all over the milky-butter that was melting into the pancakes was just dancing all over in my mouth! What a mouthful! Added to that - well done and lightly crispy-brown daily special porkchops along with golden hash browns - supplemented plenty of protein and wholesome crunch to each bite!

The experience was going good until I noticed my 6 year old daughter eating raw chicken that she was served from the kids menu (JR chicken and waffles) it was pink on the inside and breaded on the outside so it appeared normal at first but was clearly raw...< /Review>

my boyfriends bun fell off his burger and onto the seat and he politely asked for another one and they said no??????????????? it was a really really hot day, don’t know if they actually wipe down their seats but the bun landed on the seat which could’ve had someone’s sweat on it. ridiculous.< /Text>

If I was able to give negative stars I would. The place was a mess, most unorganized ihop ive ever gone to. The bus boy is serving drinks and taking out the food. It took bout 30 minutes for us to be asked what we wanted and another 30 to get it. I wont come back for sure.</Text>

<text>It's IHOP.  A long-standing chain, if you've eaten at one before, you know what's on the menu. Personally, I think it's pretty overpriced for pancakes. Yes, my kid loves it. This particular restaurant seems much like all the other IHOP's that I have been to. They were quite busy for breakfast but the service was still fine. They had boysenberry syrup on the table, being so close to Knott's Berry Farm that was a nice touch. So if you love IHOP, don't let my 3 star rating stop you. If you are not into having a sugar bomb for breakfast, there are actually a couple of alternatives on the menu, though still highly overpriced in my opinion. If you are a Gourmet coffee person who prefers less food in front of you for breakfast, this is not the place - if you catch my drift.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Very good. Kids eat dinner free, mid-week, can't beat that! Prices a little higher than other IHOPs, I think--probably just due to Knott's Berry Farm being around the corner.< /text>

Got the sirloin tips and eggs and there was a huge chunk of fat that would have amounted to four pieces of meat that should have been eatable. 😤🤑 Service is spectacular tho.< /Review>

<rate>3<//rate><review>I was disappointed with this one. We usually go to IHOP because we can count on them being clean and having good food. This one is very old and it shows. To get to most of the tables, you have to walk within 1-2 feet of the food prep area. I could literally have just reached out and grabbed\touched somebody's food! And the tables are so jam-packed that your chair is right up against someone else's and you have to slip off the side to leave your table. The only good thing was the service.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

<rating>3< /rating><Pictures>None</Pictures><text>If our server wasnt so nice, I wouldve given this place 2 stars. Theres not really any way to comfortably accomodate more then 6 guests, we had 8 guests, and 2 babies in carseats and it was CRAMPED to put it nicely. Every worker there was incredibly nice, but I could tell they noticed the space issue we were having, but none of them wanted to acknowledge it, because they truly couldn't do anything to make it any better. Aside from the close quarters, the prices were kind of ridiculous. I get that I didnt walk into a Denny's, but even nicer places dont charge 10 dollars for a kid's meal. Olive Garden charges under 7 dollars after tax for their kids meals, but IHOP? 9.19 PLUS TAX!!! I wont be going back simply because of the prices. I got charged 4.79 for a side of hash browns, which literally was a 6 inch diameter plate that was maybe 3/4 covered with hash browns. I couldnt believe it. My omelette which was JUST cheddar cheese was 12 dollars. 2 of my friends ordered a small orange juice,which was 5-and change BEFORE TAX. My party had split the check 4 ways with 1 adult meal and one kids meal on each check and each bill was close to 40 dollars. I guess I just couldnt believe the food we got was worth the price they charge. Yes the pancakes are a smidge better than most places, but everything else is the same. I will definitely not return simply because of the prices alone. For breakfast, I'd rather go to Paul's Place down the street. The food is better, and the prices are either the same, or better in comparison than IHOP. Again, this review in no way is speaking against the workers at IHOP, they were friendly and definitely did a great job while manuaerivng around our carseats which were blocking an emergency exit, just because there was nowhere else to sit our babies.</text></record>

<review>This was by far the worst IHop establishment I have ever visited, the restaurant was very small, the food took forever to get out, once it was out 25 mins later it was cold, the server Carlos seemed to not care about if we were satisfied or not, the pancakes were cold, the chicken fried steak was not only hard but there wasn't enough gravy to even cover the steak, my sons toast was so hard he couldn't even bite it, my wife order eggs with cheese and the cheese didn't melt, eggs were also cold, I think the bananas on my daughters pancakes were warmer then out entire meal... I have a suggestion, give up your food license and give the landmark space to Knotts Berry for extra parking...</review>< Response>

Good drinks, but a very overpriced restaurant. If you are not willing to pay $15-20 per person for a decent amount of food and nice drinks, dont come. Also, does NOT have all-you-can-eat pancakes.<//review>

Food was fantastic and plentiful. A bit pricey; the only reason for only 4 out of 5 stars<//text>

First time here and what a disappointment! The Place was dirty and the food was poorly made! The manager was too busy having personal conversations with the staff instead of overseeing the restaurant and making sure things were getting done right.</Text>

This place is much smaller than most IHOPs I've been too, so I'm such it gets very busy.  Orange jucir is like $5 a glass.  I'd go to the Black Bear Diner instead.< /Text>

Quick and friendly service. Quaint location. Only entrance access is available on the Northeast side of Beach Blvd at La Palma. One driveway-in & out. Great place to stop by after a full day at Knotts Berry Farm and within walking distance. Resonably priced menu with a varity of pancake flavors and choices. The steak tips caramelized with onions and mushrooms is my favorite!🍵🍽<//review>

<text>Wow, went there after a day at Knotts with the kids. $9.49 for a kids meal with NO DRINK? Are you kidding me? And then ordered a Chicken Ceasear Salad for myself,,,what a joke. Awful. This place is so overpriced and charges more because they are close to Knotts. They are at least $3 more for each item versus other IHOP's. Management, you should be ashamed of yourself.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This IHOP's prices are higher than any other IHOP I have ever visited, they are across the street from Knott's Berry Farm. They are understaffed and the place is too small.

Horrible service! Waited for our order for such long time. People that came after us were sitted and served and we kept waiting. Ask how long more and was told our order was told our order is about to get started. Didnt get an apology or anything. Ask for the check to our our drinks and decided to leave. Waiyed over an hour and didnt eat!<//Review>

<review>So i went after scary nights at knotts and took my kids and friends in there.Service its good friendly people there but the food sucks and its way too expensive.i ordered a fajita chicken omelette. And all i got was eggs loaded with onions there were 4 chunks of chicken the size of my finger nail but i had to look for them. I worked for IHOP for 3 years and never ever saw an omelette like that. eggs were a little raw too....needles to say i will never go back to i hop i am a Dennis man from now on!< /review>< pics>

Excellent service, clean, my problem  was that the crepe I've ordered were tasting like old oil or dirty pan, couldn't eat them, I did complaint and they gave me 10% discount, but charged me for the side order of creps with lingonberries, Beach Blvd Buena Park.<//text>

Besides being pretty cramped, it was  a typical IHOP. The service was fast, the orders were all correct, and the food was good - can't really ask for more than that.</review>

The waitress started well. Once we asked several times for ketchup she became the worst waiter in the world. We complained and basically told us verbatim we should not be allowed to go out in public.</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Very good place. He is small and sometimes he can get in a lot of line. Kind attention. The menu is not as complete as in other places because it does not offer the 3x3x3 combo ... The food is delicious and the prices are the same as elsewhere, it just depends on how many things you are going to consume. The portions are big and you can share your dish with another person without any problem. I did not like that they do not have WiFi.

(Translated by Google) Good service and food for all tastes. Love the pancakes, but their wraps and burgers are good too. Children eat for free from the children's menu on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays accompanied by an adult.

God service og mad for enhver smag. Elsker pandekagerne, men deres wraps og burgere er også gode. Børn spiser gratis fra børnemenuen tirsdag, onsdag og torsdag i  følge med en voksen.</Review>
