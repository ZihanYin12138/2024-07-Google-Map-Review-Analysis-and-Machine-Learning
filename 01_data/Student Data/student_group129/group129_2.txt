If you want authentic Mexican food and at a great low price this place is a treasure! We scored the jalepeno poppers were amazing and the hot wings had a great Mexican twist to them the homemade house salsa bar was epic  and we loved it so much that we made a friendship pact to come here every taco Tuesday and work our way thru the entire menu this is the best spot on Humboldt to eat in my opinion I loved the atmosphere and the place feels like going over to Grandma's for family dinner it was 5stars times 50! We had like 12 different items including dessert for $60!!! But you can easily feed yourself WELL for under $10!!!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG9GoMSohcH_Wb-2K-PqhUwddL_8Cyqee4L5o4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVzivqdi6o1Plc8UVpZFn4t1knUcW-nDFBdety=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM04Z99ZdoQ9nbpEyPa3kQ4NkLZrbc5Ha9dvfsP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7ZdCez6p7YLcgRT5HmBVnupeWAx_JxNN6cCxl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXeydaLgH0IHhom7XQxXBkTwaYi0EXl80o_DHM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x54d4010337fa9061:0x2021e93adb3a5ade</Gmap_id></record>

So good, so good, so good! No problem getting your meal exactly as you prefer it, in my case, with lettuce, tomato, and sliced avocado on everything I order. Delicious red enchilada sauce, the best chili relleno anywhere. And I might add, great service with a great waiter to boot!
Kudos to Pete!<//Text>

It was delicious except my boyfriend specifically asked for no guacamole and there was a lot in the burrito. He couldn't eat it,ended up giving it to our son who loves guacamole. Lol the chips and salsa bar are amazing and the prices are great.🥑🌯🌮< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><review>This is the real deal folks. It's so hard getting good Mexican here in Humboldt and I'm glad to say I have finally found it. First there is a salsa bar. That alone should be enough to come and visit. But let me tell you this place has the best tortilla chips around. Thick and crunchy and warm. A+++

The food is also top notch. With good portions at a price where you won't feel like your getting ripped off for a couple tacos with beans and rice. Speaking of beans and rice this place delivers. Thick and rich refried beans and rice strait out of southern California (old Mexicao 😉).

There are also plenty of filling choices for those tacos and burritos including all the normal Mexican meats and also a verity of vegan and vegetarian options...great job!

It's a tiny but out of town (Humboldt hill) but the restaurant is cute with lots of light and plant life. If you haven't been here yet and are a fan of Mexican food give it a try. You won't be disappointed.< /review><Rating>5<//Rating><Time>1552189407022< /Time>< user_id>

My Husband & I wanted to try someplace new for lunch.  What a wonderful surprise. The salsa bar is great. My deluxe  Tostada was was really good the tortilla on the bottom was still crunchy not soggy! My husband had a black bean & cheese burrito for $3.95 he almost ordered 2 because he thought at that price they would be small it was perfect.
Thanks ladies we’ll be back soon!!< /Text>

<Review>Pete was a great host, very dry sense of humor but his recommendations were spot on for pork in my chimichanga and the food was better then in San Fransisco. We went away with having a tab of $35 for two dinners, two alcoholic drinks and dessert. You can't beat that for the taste and the quality of food anywhere. Oh yeah and did I mention they have a salad bar with over five salsas and picked veggies. Thanks Pete, you legend!</Review><user_id>117928763841315846721<//user_id><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>DELICIOUS! This place *never* fails us! Fresh ingredients, authentically made BY HAND, and a meal that we always look forward to with our mouthes watering...every week! (YES! We go at least once a week to see Peter (best server EVER!) and get our fill of scrumptious Mexican Food. The Salsa Bar--loaded with seven or eight different handmade salsas-- is fantastic! Don't miss it! Plenty of excellent beer on tap, too!</text><resp>None< /resp><Pics>None<//Pics>< name>

A small cafe with a small staff. Everything on the menu is worth the wait. When you step inside you are technically taking a personal trip to the cooks lifetime of experience. I haven't tasted food like this since Baja California. Affordable with generous portions for casual special occasion dining or just a satisfying meal. Please support this venue.< /review>

<review>They have some very good lunch time specials that I do enjoy. I have not tried them for dinner, so I can't really rate them on that. So somebody with more of a dinner special it's going to have to rate them on that I have not a clue.<//review>< Name>

Found this place driving through town on our way down the coast.  Had enchiladas with mole and chimichanga.  Easily some of the best Mexican food I've had for a while.  The rice and beans were excellent,  the salsa was so good and they have a variety of different kinds.  The waiter was super nice and the food came out quickly.  Definitely would stop here again</Text>

I love the food here so much. I ate here all the time when I lived here. I take away a star because they now are never open. I have visited three times since living here, for five days each, and have never gotten to eat here. I am upset, and sad. I guess I have to stop recommending this place. It is always closed when my friends go. I am up here now, and it has been closed the past 4 days.< /Review>

I've eaten at most of the Mexican eateries in Humboldt and this is by far the best. Great homemade flavor, salsa bar, great atmosphere, local beers on tap, friendly staff. Had the mole and Chile verde and will definitely be back for more.</Review>

<text>I LOVE LITTLE JALISCO! This restaurant is one of my favorite places to eat in Humboldt for sure. I love ALL of their food, the entire menu is so appealing and delicious! They also have the tastiest salsa bar in town. Yolanda and Pete are true sweethearts, they make the experience even more pleasant and flavorful. Try their REAL HOMEMADE HORCHATA, simply the bomb! This little hole in the wall will surprise you, the place is clean, inviting and it has a REAL MEXICAN TASTE. Nothing is an imitation, go get some tasty treas and don't forget to try THE BEST SALSA BAR in Eureka (:< /text><response>None< /response><userid>104366931711825027782</userid><Name>Le Que<//Name>< Gmap_id>

Great place. Pete's a trip. In response to Judy Pohl's prior post... did she say "tasted yuck"? My 4 year-old uses better verbiage.  And did she also state that the "rude waiter interrupted my tel call" to ask if she were finished with her meal? As in telephone call? Seriously?? Whats wrong with these entitled millennials??? Can't put your iphone down for 2 seconds to tell your server you are/are not finished? Stay in the Taco Bell drive thru Judy.<//text>

<Text>The ice cream flavors are unique and super tasty. So far, we've tried the milk and cereal, which is so good. The ice cream tastes like the milk that's left once all the cereal is gone. We've also tried the churro flavor and the thai tea ice cream, which are SO good. Today we had the jasmine milk tea, which is phenomenal, and we had it in the sweet bun, which is basically ice cream in a doughnut--you can't go wrong there. The cookie monster flavor, and mint monster are good, but not as good as the others. Cookie butter is okay, but I've had it way better at other places. This ice cream place is in a really cute shopping center, next to a koi pond, and a ton of really nice seating.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating></record>

< Review>
love afters ice cream. but i tried calling to see if the shop was open due to new covid restrictions. no one answered the first time i tried. the next a man answered and asked how he could help. after i asked him my question he started saying some highly inappropriate things and asking for my number. not sure if the site has a wrong number posted or if this was an employee.</Review>

<review>I always love coming here. Some of my favorite flavors are Cookie Monster, Frozen Hot Chocolate, and the Rick and Morty flavor called Dark Matter. It's basically chocolate ice cream with Brownie bits. Delicious. This flavor will turn your mouth black after eating but I dont care, it's well worth it. 😁<//review>< Pics>

There's a good amount of flavors here at afters, and I really think their ice cream is amazing. My recommendations would be the jasmine milk tea and the vietnamese iced coffee! They're such unique flavors that I enjoy a lot. I gotta come back again for more<//Review>

The interior are funny, quirky and beautiful and the same time. They haven't got too many flavors, but whatever they have are really good.  We tried  the Mango Sorbet and Triple C the "c" being chocolate, caramel.and chips.  Service is good and they allow you to sample the falvors before you take a decision.</text>

<pics>None< /pics><review>I can say that my experience at after ice cream shop in woodland Hills today was a very good experience The line can be very busy here but I would say that it's definitely worth it if you're looking for some ice cream in the area they have very good flavors The prices don't seem very bad which is something that's a big plus in my book And the portion sizing is pretty good too I would say if you're there they're winning selection would be the milky tea bun which is where they put ice cream in the middle of a hot donut which is really goodone thing I will warn you of is that it can get very hot the bun I mean and it may melt your ice cream a little faster than you think so definitely make sure to keep an eye out to keep you outfit nice and fresh I would say if you are in the area you will definitely enjoy yourself so I would check it out<//review><response>None</response>< UserId.>

Tasty, but expensive. The price seems ridiculous for what you get. It's a fine concept, but there are other ice cream spots in the plaza. Also, the spoons are odd.</text>

Ok, not the best. Sort of random flavors and the ice cream is not as unique as they believe it is. If you're at the mall, try it. Otherwise it's not worth making a special trip there.< /review>

<Review>I live out out of town but when I come to visit I always get my hair cut here, they are really good at what they do, I always get Maggie, if you go by the main entrance walk to the back side on the left. You can schedule appointments which is useful since its a little busy later on during the day.</Review><date>1605463286412< /date><user_name>FERNANDO SANCHEZ</user_name>< pictures>

Not the best atmosphere. If you want a good haircut, be prepared to wait, even if there's nobody in line ahead of you.

The barbers there look at anyone new and turn away. And they take their friends before other customers (not talking about appointments), which can lead to you waiting for a very long time.

They layout, while cozy, is unclear. You don't know where you should really go, or who to talk to and ask.</text>

First time trying out this place. Spacious, clean and nice looking interior. The lady who cut my hair was very polite and professional. I didn't have enough for tips and she told me "it's OK, don't worry about it". Definitely coming here many more times.

Love my hair cut and it was only $12. Wonderful place!!< /review>

<text>Eddie’s a beast. One of the best out there. He knows his craft, has great communication skills, and will make you look good. When you tell him what you want or like, he give you great feedback and recommendation. The end product is a fresh cut that looks good every time. Go see him.<//text>< pictures>

In order to get good service, you have to know barbers, barbers have their clients and they take them does not matter if there is somebody before waiting. I waited for about two hours to get my son haircut. I won't come back to this place. Even if they do good job, they did not care about people waiting for so long time., and I again I won't come back.< /Review>

<Text>They take their sweet time. When the staff see someone is getting impatient, they just decide to take their precious time. I'm a very unsatisfied customer.

This is by far the best barber shop I have been to. Not only is the staff extremely welcoming and friendly, but the effort that the barbers give into your haircut is definitely satisfying. I am always 100% satisfied with my haircut. I've never had a barber there screw up my hair, I always walk out happy. I personally request Eddie or Joel. Check out his Instagram @Eddie4039 for his work. I can assure you that you'll be satisfied with your haircut if you choose Christian and Roberto's.</text>

Very good place to get haircut! Long wait times and if you don't know barbers personally they will skip you to get their friends haircut before yours. The cuts are fresh but you have to be willing to wait awhile and the prices differ from who cuts your hair. Prices can be 15 dollars plus!<//review>

Best barber shop I've ever been to! The barbers love to joke around and strike up a conversation with you, almost make you feel at home! Highest quality cuts at low prices, definitely worth a 20-30 minute wait!</Review>

You wouldn't think this place would be a good barbershop because they are kinda in the ghettos but these guys are extremely talented and professional at what they do.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><time>1534797011065<//time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This place is the best around. Eddie is my dude! I've been going to him for about a year and a half now and he's always done a solid job. I was definitely paying double at my last barber shop for not as good of a job. Highly recommend them</Review>< pictures>

I just got one of the best haircuts I’ve ever had. I’m from out of town and thought I would give this place a try. They only except cash so this is something to keep in mind. If I’m ever around these parts I will go out of my way to get another haircut here.<//text>

<text>This is a very nice place, the people is very nice, very good performance cutting hair, they give advises on hair care. Only cash!! Make sure you pick your personal barber so you can schedule an appointment, I recommend Eddie but go, check it and then you decide.<//text>< rate>

Came in for a shave and hair cut. Hair cut turned out good but the shave was not what I hoped for and was left with stubble. I was under the impression that a hot towel would be used before applying the shaving cream, it wasn't, in fact no hot towel was used at all.

From the outside, this place does not look like much.Inside, theres modern look to with old style wood cabinets, flat screen television, surround sound and stain glass which adds a nice touch to the place. It's also clean with comfortable seating.

Haircut $11= Good Deal
Shave $11 = This would also be a good deal if hot towels were used. Therefore, it should be $5.

They seem to be expanding the shop. This could result price increase at some point in time.</Review>

<Text>The barber shop is set up well, unfortunately their organization is out of control. This place offers a fast pass for $25. The pass is to skip the wait and jump ahead of the line; however, the barbers are unorganize. Even if you choose the pass, there is people angry because they been waiting. So, the barbers end up passing people ahead even if you choose to buy the pass. Also, I do not recommend the hair stylist for the women. I've had my hair cut twice, different ladies and the outcome is "ugly." The ladies only know how to do old school cuts. If you like the old school round leyers or straight cut, this might be your designated stop.<//Text><rate>2<//rate><gmapID>0x80c32e762a0e36bd:0x733e052ef62221be<//gmapID><Response>None<//Response>< UserId.>

It's an easy way to have snack from the freezer, but when i open this pizza the pepperoni to little and so the cheese, pls add more cheese and pepperoni so bread won't dry.</review>

We just ordered, the pizza was cold, and cardboard like our calzone was nothing but a mess of burnt open faced dough. The wings were inedible I’m assuming microwaved to long, my chicken tenders for my grandson were mush! Pretty disappointed! Almost 70$ down the drain.< /Text>

The service was friendly. The restaurant was busy but not too busy. Everything perfect. The thing was that I was not to satisfied with, was that my mushroom Alfredo dinner.  It tasted like shrimp and when your not in the mood for seafood your just not in the mood.  Bite after bite was fishy maybe a pan mixed up or not properly washed. I don't know, but it was not to my liking. I'm scarred from this. I hope one day I will be able to eat there again.< /text>

So I’m here for the salad bar and 😒😩it’s wilted lettuce how can you have wilted lettuce at lunchtime the pizza on the other hand was fresh the marinara sauce tasted great the interior could use an uplift and deep cleaning my waitress was super friendly but the guy at the counter is not to friendly or welcoming in my opinion. But it’s a pizza place and the pizza is ok.< /text>

<Text>Extremely overpriced for the portion sizes and the quality of food. You're 3 hour delivery time was completely absurd and a $25 delivery fee to the Railhead at Yermo is ridiculous. Quite frankly, I think you take advantage of the soldiers here at the Railhead with your $120 minimum order and your $25 delivery fee. I definitely know where not to go when I come back here.<//Text>< pics>

It was a ok at best visit the place was clean went at a slower time so it was not to busy the girl that took our food order was nice seem a little bit in a hurry to take our order still maybe because she was the only one at the counter?. The pizza was a bit dry maybe a difference cook in the afternoon from what I was told the pizza was supposed to be good. I'll give it another try sometime again before I fully criticize the pizza.< /review>

Pizza was good (better after I reheated), the guy behind the counter (owner) was rude, the salad bar was bad, the token dispenser does not give you your value in money that you put in. The prizes were a joke, I'm not expecting amazing prizes, but these were ridiculous especially for the price. The food was overpriced. This place has definitely lost site on how to provide a great dining experience. Save your money and go somewhere else</text>

This is truly the worst pizza place I've ever been to !!! Manager should fire every single person who worked last night!! First we go in there and the guy behind the counter said someone will be with you in a moment then he sat there and stared at us rather than going and finding someone to help us. When she finally came around we tried to order a pizza and salad bar she tells us salad bar is closed. All the food was still out there but we couldn't buy one!! We place an  order anyways and walk around the corner and the only other customers is 3 guys sitting together but there wasn't a clean table in the place, most of them piled high with plates and trash so we found the cleanest one and I wiped it down my self. when the pizza came to the table all the topping were in the center of the pizza there was nothing on the outer 3 inches of the pizza not even cheese the woman who brought the pizza acted like she was mad she had to even serve us and wouldn't even talk to us. a few minutes into the pizza we wanted another beer and had to go to the front to place the order  when we left they were just starting to tear down the salad bar!! We will never go back there again!!</review>

The game machines are run by a different vendor I hit 2 jackpots and the machine ran out of tickets and the manager took care of his customers and let my boys get the prize they wanted. Thanx again good to see some places still care about customer service< /text>

Terrible service ! Ordered delivery - they said it would take 1 hour - which took 1 hour 10 minutes . The order was wrong and the food was cold. I asked the delivery driver for cheese and peppers and he said he’s not allowed to bring any unless we “ order” it... really ?! Cheese and peppers ! I called and reported it and they said I’d didn’t order what was missing ... and he’s have to send back someone with the cheese and peppers .... whatever - never again !<//text>

<Text>Food is lacking quality, it’s expensive, and service is horrible. The owner is just the rudest person I’ve ever met and will never take the advice from anyone. He really needs to change his ways or Barstow will not support this business anymore and it will close down just like every other failed business in Barstow.< /Text><Rate>1</Rate><Resp>None</Resp>< Name>

Good food. Its a great place to take the kids for lunch or dinner. They can play a few games before the food arrives. Cash in there tickets for a lil prize. They offer beers too i think. Easy local fun. Only down is the place is cramped on weekends and no real maitenance for the arcades.< /Text>

We love Red Baron. I work at the T-Mobile in Barstow and we order from Red Baron almost every Sunday. Their driver/manager/cook is always polite and kind. Our food always gets here warm and ready to eat.</review>

<review>This place used to be my favorite. Now it’s terrible. The pizza is disgusting now. The wings are always saturated, I have no idea if management changed or what. Like I said, used to be my favorite. Now I’m highly disappointed. Not worth the price.< /review><Rate>2< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

<Text>FIRST and LAST time ordering from this place. I just ordered a Philly cheese  steak, pastrami and fries.  No lie, the philly was good but where was the meat. I could count the pieces on one hand. It was basically filled with bell peppers, onions and jalapenos. My husband had the pastrami and again there was NO MEAT . Last there were the fries that TASTED like they were cooked in old grease. I could taste it. Fries was a waste cause I had no more than the initial bite. I'll give 1 star for the flavor of the "Bell pepper, onions and jalapeno sandwich"</Text>< pictures>

Yummy! Good food and the best delivery opinion for locals that want pizza. They even deliver in Irwin Estates. I'm waiting on my Spaghetti and garlic bread w/ salad now. But the brick and mortar is more fun for the kids with a desire to play arcade games or the adults who want a beer or wine.</text>

Food quality not as good as it used to be and used to have better customer service, no one came to check back after serving our food. (They used to) Used to have actual plates and cups, but now plastic cups and thin paper plates. Our family has come here for years, but will not be going back. It's just not the same since the remodel. Feels very cheap with higher prices.< /review>

I've been a customer of theirs since I moved here, their hot wings should be their signature dish. These guys put together decent family meals for reasonable prices. Their delivery times usually beat the chain pizza places too</Review>

<Text>Worst experience ever. Was told on the phone the special was 9.99 for a large one topping pizza. My husband went and ordered the pizza and added 2 toppings and was charged 20.00. We called the manager and he wanted to argue and say we were never told that when they weren't the ones on the call in the first place. They are crooks and the pizza was not very good at all. I would have rather went to Little Ceasars.  I will never buy from then again.< /Text>< gmapID>

Without a doubt our favorite. But tonight I called in an order at 5:15 called back at 6:15. Asking what happened to 45 mns? Was told 5 to 10 more mns. Called back 45 mns plus later and am told they dont know. My pizza showed up with the driver acting like I should be grateful he showed at all. No plates no napkins! 3 packets of parm for 2 large pizzas. So generous right? Then as a final screw you the pizza was cold. They gave me half off to try and make it right. But its had gone past that the first 5 or 10 mns lie!<//text>

< review>
Food is horrible and then they gave me a frozen brownie that went with my lunch special after waiting 52 minutes for a small pizza and a Calzone. They needed more staff and some with more manners.   Will never be back.<//review>

The owner is a thief and didn’t pay the contractor for the remodeling he did. This owner owes $30,000 yes! $30k. I refuse to go here until the owners pays its obligations.<//text>

Horrible experience. Overpriced and services don’t live up to prices. Don’t waste your $$. It looks nice on the inside but looks are deceiving. Deluxe pedicure $58 plus $15 for gel. Definitely won’t be going back! Feel so cheated!< /Text>

<Review>Lady that was doing my nails was so rude to me and treated me like I was nobody I will never go back here again when I asked her name she said she can’t tell me and when I asked for owner she said she never comes to this location and to top it off she said she don’t work here and was just so rude to me. Don’t go here save your time and money for someone that treats you fare. Other lady that was there and heard her Angelina was her name ugh I’m so annoyed with the customer service they gave me< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x8090407aef350363:0xca341a8ec24e2165< /gmap_id></record>

<text>It’s hard to find a good nail spa that has a beautiful interior as well as great nail technicians, but that’s why I love to visit Queen Bee every time I’m in town....today I wanted something custom, creative, long and fun! Thankfully I was paired with the perfect person...Vivian! She had a wonderful vibe and took her time paying attention to detail and I could tell she really knew what she was doing. All I had to do was show her some pictures to give her an idea of what I wanted and she took my idea and turned it into a masterpiece! My favorite thing about Vivian is that she loves what she does and it shows in her work. I will definitely make sure I visit her every time I’m in town....thanks again Viv, I love ya and everyone at Queen Bee!< /text>< Response>

I’ve been coming to Queen Bee since they opened years ago.  They were one of the few places open on Sundays back in the day.  It is under new management/ownership and they’ve made a few changes and things are really good.  I like the options in services, they stay current on colors, styles, etc.</text>

I gave them 3 stars because they don't seem too happy with you if you ask for a basic manufacture.  I get better customer service from the manicurists when I ask for a full set or gel. Their cashier or manager is always super sweet  tho</Review>

< Review>
I avoid negative reviews but when they are deserving I go all in: This place is deceptive when u look at how cute the decor and fancy chairs are when u first walk in. That's where the money goes- it seems, not into the training. Cut my fingers up w the drummel tool. Didn't cover my toes with polish, it looks like my child did my pedicure. I asked that they push my cuticles back and i guess that was comparable work to pulling teeth. To shape my nail how I wanted was ten dollar extra. I asked for ombre glitter on one nail per hand: 4 dollars extra per nail: looking very lumpy & not hombre! Not cute. I left with cuts/blood on 4 fingers.< /Review>

<review>They have changed owners and it has a different feel to it. I didn't care for the music they were playing. The girl doing my pedicure did a good job but the one that did my nails didn't make the french tips very straight. I think I'll have to look for a new place to go.< /review>< Name>

Gel polish cost is not listed as part of expensive pedicure, it's an additional $15. We were not informed until it we checked out. Pedicure was $55.<//review>

The scenery was nice when I first entered and when I got to the front desk I asked if there was a charge for coffin shape nails and was told "no " but once I sat in the chair the lady told me there was a charge for shape.Did not have a problem with the extra $5 but I would have liked a consistent answer. Besides one nail the shaping came out decent. Its been two weeks and already need a fill used to my nails lasting at least up to 3weeks.The attitude of the employees was friendly at first but I was not pleased with how they were speaking about the other customer's style preference saying "that style is in the bay area not here" plan to look in the area to see if there is a nail salon that does better.<//text>

< Review>
This used to be a nice place. All of the great manicurists left and went to a salon in Lathrop. The last time I was here, my daughter and I had our eyebrows waxed. The lady burned my daughter. When she told her that it was too hot, the lady argued and said it wasn't. We left before she was done. That night her eyebrows were scabs. Her wedding was in four days. Thank goodness for Neosporin and good makeup. It wasn't noticeable at her wedding.< /Review>

Worst nail service I’ve ever experienced!! Literally the whole place smelled like fish and they were playing the same Vietnamese pop song over and over on a reel for two hours all of my cuticles were cut open and bleeding and my skin was buffed until it was raw I will not be returning</text>

Poor job and poor service. I got a mani and pedi. Polish is not even. I keep finding spots of polish on my skin and even underneath my nails. My pedicure was a little painful too. After all that I wasn't even offered the massage chair to be on. Maybe an extra charge? Lol Then when I went to pay I gave my debit card and the man seen I had cash and requested cash! Never again!<//Review>

I am a user of another salon in Manteca since 2011. My sister wanted to try somewhere different since she just moved here from Bay Area, the lady
I had was not very nice and not friendly like the one my sister had. I will stick to where I've been going.......did not do as good as I was hoping.</Review>

I went there to get a full set, and I was so disappointed. I don't know the name of the man who did my nails, but I won't be going back. He dug into my nail bed so deep that it's finally grown out. I told him it was burning but he didn't change his technique. A couple of the nail tips weren't even secured properly to my nail, there were gaps where acrylic had gotten between my nail and the nail tip he put on. I found it to be pricy for such a shoddy job.<//Text>

I went and got my nails and eyebrows done with my friend. First they made our eyebrows uneven and not shaped the same. Secondly not even two days after we got our nails done they broke. Today being the third day i had another one fly off without a fight. I dont even want to give them a star but i have to. So just so you guys no do not go here for nails or euenrows what so ever was not worth the 45$ we spent for a set of acrylic nails.< /review>

Horrible service today. I had to tell him twice to trim inner nails, he cut me twice and didn't even use a pummace on my heals, so they are not soft and smooth but scratchy and dry and I just left! Glad I used a gift cert, cuz I went be returning.< /review>

(I went to Aldi for cash back) had an almost $10 California burrito and although its big in size its mediocre on taste, also there are no restrooms and the sanitizer they have was sticky. To be honest it had plenty of orders while I was there but based on my burrito it was not worth it.<//text><Rating>3</Rating>< UserId.>

The best Burritos in South Bay in my opinion you can taste the freshness and the prices are very reasonable and staff is very friendly. I come here every Friday is my ritual craving the bean and cheese this is the real deal.<//text>

CASH ONLY spot so a bit inconvenient. Ordered 2 shrimp burritos, rice and shrimp only due to custom order, they were really big. Ordered 12 rolled tacos with only cheese for our boys. The bottom layer had white cheese on them, maybe monterrey or maybe mozzarella not sure which, but the top layer was very dry with no cheese at all.  I would return.<//review>

Great burritos, cash only, just the only thing is the menudo. Not good. It doesn't taste fresh and the meat is all brown because it's old. I wonder how many days that menudo had when they served it to me 🤢🤮. But the burritos are bomb! Love the breakfast burrito with some beans in it. Should have order that instead of menudo lol<//text>

Always good food. I know people who drive down to Chula Vista to get the Carne Asada Burrito. I get one with rice and beans, cut it in half, and have two dinners. Can't eat a whole one at one sitting. Enjoy</review>

<text>This is a hidden gem on the border of National City and Chula Vista.
We all know that Mexican food joints are a dime a dozen here in SoCal and I've tried them all.
The breakfast burritos here are AWESOME delicious and are the size of a small baby....seriously delicious, seriously big and in my opinion the best in the area. I'm working through the menu and have not been disappointed. Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you. One of my faves in the area.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80d95206323ee971:0x695597833ae49f9f</gmap_id></record>

<review>This place takes me back. The taste of their food reminded me of the first time I ate at a taco shop. It's like they've kept with the same formula whereas others have moved on to suit the tastes of what today's trends are. Traditional, I'd called it. Simple dishes, traditional flavors that brought about nostalgia, and generous servings.< /review>< Pictures>

When you pull back the foil on your meal, your eyes tell you this is gonna be awesome. And when they hand you your burrito out the window in the drivethru.... it weighs a lot. I cant put my hand all the way around it. Whether it's a bean and cheese or a shrimp burrito, attention is paid to details. I'd hire that one cook away to cook for me but I know in a week I'd be bigger than a house. You'll never go anywhere else.

A great place to get seafood. A warning to those that do go for the first time  go super hungry or bring a friend to share.

My fav is either the surf and.turf: a burrito with carne asada and shrimp with rice.l and guac The shrimp are not your small nail sized shrimp, so it's worth going for.

The other thing I get is the Delmar fish and shrimp burrito made  with rice, lettuce dressed with tartar sauce and salsa.

I have been going for years and since leaving San Diego 20 yrs ago I still go back.<//text>

Best Cali burrito ever, love the chunks of potatoes. Get everything on it because it's flavorful and enough for two but why would you want to share. It's hot in the actual ordering area but they have a small eating area outside. Cashier very friendly and polite, the cook is super fast and clearly knows his way around the kitchen. Great place to go if you're hungry and on the go. I usually eat half right away and save the other for later. It's still good reheated!<//Text>

This hole in the wall is amazing. No wonder why the place had an A grade. The salsas are covered and the burritos are huge! I ordered a surf and turf burrito for my bf and myself. We ended up with a burrito longer than my forearm! That burrito was at least 16 inches! It is always clean and they only do cash so come prepared.< /Text>

NEVER HAD I EVER RECEIVED NACHO CHEESE ON MY CARNE ASADA FRIES IN ALL MY LIFE! THE ROLLED TACOS WERE STALE AND HAD OLD NASTY LETTUCE AND THE TORTILLA ON THE CARNE ASADA BURRITO WAS NOT EVEN COOKED.  THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO PAY THEM A VISIT.  PEOPLE WHO SERVE UNDER QUALITY FOOD WITH HIGH PRICES ARE THIEVES!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

We found this little restaurant 20 years ago when we lived in San Diego and never miss an opportunity  to go and visit every time we are in the city.  The place itself is very small inside and with a few plastic tables on the sidewalk.  We don't  care much since the food is worthy.</text>< pics>

Absolutely disgusting.I decide to visit for some roll tacos. Simple as that, tasteless! Guacamole was old and sour, lettuce was soggy, salsa was like WATER. What a waste of money. They need to fix the quality of their food. Not fair for hardworking people to spend their money on stale tasting food. Drive thru is still the same. Just a window you pull up to. Oh and no bathroom. Get it together colimas.<//Review>

Always great burrito. It may be a small place but it's very clean and the girl behind the counter is always a sweetheart.< /review>

This is one small hole in the wall you don't want to go to.  I'd been here many years ago because my brother in law highly recommended it.  We loved it the first time we went.  This time though I'm very disappointed to say the least.  I don't mind paying good money for good food.  But this was not the case today.  Price point is way to high for the quality of food we got.  I had to send back my plate and husband's bean burrito.  The beans were bad, as in they were not good anymore and they could have caused us to get sick.  My husband opted for a Cali burrito,  and it was good. I had the carné asada chimichanga with NO beans LOL . It was good too. You would think the lady would have just exchanged it.  NOPE she charged us the difference. .😒👎 so needless to say we won't be returning. I can't imagine how many people go through their drive through and get home only to find out the beans are bad. Yuck.  Bad pick today,  i should have went to Naruto sushi on 3rd ave.  Now that's MONEY well spent.< /Review>

Nice place for an intimate or smaller(ish) wedding.  They have the views, backgrounds, and back drops.  Reception space is nicely rustically elegant.  Food is better than most being catered.<//Text>

<Text>My husband and I got married at Galway Downs last year, and it was truly the most amazing experience from planning to celebrating our special day. The entire staff was so knowledgeable, thorough, and professional. They made the planning process easy by giving us a folder that walked us through every step. The day of the wedding went so smoothly, which meant that my husband and I could focus on each other. The venue is even more gorgeous in person than in the pictures with a beautiful outdoor ceremony site and a warm indoor reception area. The food, music, and overall ambiance is absolutely perfect from start to finish. We can honestly say that it was the best day of our lives for so many reasons, one of those being the venue. I still get compliments from family and friends to this day, and I couldn't have imagined a better wedding.<//Text>< gmapID>

Wedgewood Galway Downs is simply amazing! The venue appearance and environment is beautiful and speaks for itself. From the ranch-like setting, to the trees, woodwork, fish ponds, and other outdoor decor, the presentable nature is so inviting. On top of that, the bridal and groom suites are fantastic and some of the biggest and most comfortable amongst the southern California Wedgewood locations. There is SO much I can brag about when it comes to Galway Downs, however I'd lastly like to highlight the exceptional staff! 👏 My husband and I got married at Galway Downs in January of 2018, and the staff is the most welcoming and comforting among any. They handled large to small details, and allowed us to be assured that they would take care of everything, and they did just that! My day of coordinator Aubrey even went the extra mile to rake leaves within the grass area that covered our ceremony site. The staff made sure to give us our best day ever! We are so grateful to them. 😊 Thank you Galway Downs for your professionalism, hard work, positivity and most importantly, giving us the best wedding day we always truly dreamt about.<//Text>

Alex bustled my dress in about 30 seconds flat when it took all my other supports practicing for about fifteen minutes to try and get my bustle secure. The venue is flawlessly stunning, Chef Grace and her staff prepared immaculate food that our guests rave about even months later, and everything went off without any glitches. I will never forget how amazing our wedding was, especially since we got married in 2020!

<text>I am the first to admit that I am not a "go with the flow" bride and that I need to have every detail understood and taken care of to be satisfied. In the last year of planning my wedding, Galway Downs has bent over backwards and forwards in helping me get through this process despite Covid. Yes you need to make some sacrifice if you insist on getting married during this time, for example, the buffet is not going to be self-serve, a partition will be there and someone will serve the guests as they walk down the buffet line. These are the rules of the government, not the venue. They do not cancel your wedding date because of Covid and not refund you. You have the option of rescheduling your wedding on a different day using the same deposit for up to one year. If you have booked and need to cancel for whatever reason, the reality is that the contract literally addresses "pandemics" in their policy. This is business. Expecting not to be charged for a certain amount  (that you have agreed on) while having your wedding take up a Saturday for the last X months, then to decide to reschedule based on Covid regulations you feel don't fit with the vision of your wedding and then be upset because you didn't get your down payment refunded is indicative you have very limited knowledge on how businesses must operate. You have taken up a Saturday wedding slot away form all the hundreds of other brides freaking out about finding a venue for their wedding. This has not been my experience but I feel strongly enough about how great everyone at Wedgwood is and how they're doing everything in their power to help me have my dream wedding. They respond to my micro-managed repetitive emails so quickly! They answer all my questions and send me photos because I need to know what their tea cups look like, I need to know how many people will be picking up dirty plates, and I need to know if I can get to the venue as early as I am asking in order to calm my nerves the day of the wedding. Galway Downs has given me ALL of the things I'm asking for. They want you to have a wonderful wedding!!! Just communicate and ask questions and they will hold up their end of the bargain.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_name>

People have told me in the past that you can’t just go with the first venue you look at. Well with Galway Downs I did just that. It was perfect and made our wedding day beyond what we imagined. Everything went smoothly and we have not a single complaint, exactly how you want your wedding day to go!! Our guests still talk about how great the venue was too. I can honestly say I didn’t have the typical stress that brides talk about simply because Galway Downs makes the planning process a breeze.</text>

<Text>One of the best decisions I ever made was booking our wedding at Galway Downs. Everything was perfect, easy and stress free! From booking, planning, and our wedding day. Their team is so sweet and helpful and all of their vendors are amazing as well. My husband and I live almost 3 hours away from the venue and planning couldn’t have been easier for us. Our family and friends still rave about how beautiful the venue and how perfect our wedding was.</Text>< name>

Galway downs was the BEST venue for my husband and I. It was so beautiful, but on top of that, the planning process was so simple. It’s really stressful planning a wedding and the team at Galway Downs was incredible. They make it so simple and have vendor recommendations for any other “extras” you may want for your wedding day. I appreciate all of the teams hard work in pulling off the best day of my life, and I would highly recommend this venue to anyone looking for the beautiful outdoor/indoor aesthetic as well as ease in planning and affordability!< /review>

<text>My husband and I got married at Galway Downs in June of 2018 and almost every single person who attended said it was one of the most beautiful venues they’d ever seen! Definitely one of Temecula’s best kept secrets! The food was delicious and the people were responsive to our needs and expectations. They really think of everything. I’d highly recommend it to any other couple looking for a wonderful venue.</text><Gmap_id>0x80db827dbd18cf51:0x69c88d522e76bc0b< /Gmap_id><date>1602705941560<//date>< user>

They are unethical, unprofessional and insensitive during these uncertain times.

The venue is so beautiful that every picture we have is breathtaking and there are so many different areas that you get a good variety of shots. It’s big enough for a large wedding but still feels intimate and it’s secluded so you really feel like there’s nothing else around you. The staff is amazing to work with! They seriously did everything for us and you can tell they have done many weddings because they knew exactly what was needed and were always so calm. They make everything so smooth and even bustled my dress after the ceremony! It’s so easy to plan because they have all the vendors set up through them but you can also pick and choose what you want to use so you can really personalize the wedding to what you want. With all the options there’s no way you will have the same wedding as anyone else. I also loved that we were able to get ready on site, makes that morning way less stressful and they even gave us a bottle of champagne to get the day going! The food was great and our guests really appreciated the amount of food they had and the bartenders are amazing!!! They made all our guests very happy! Lol! Honestly this venue is perfect, I wouldn’t change one thing about our wedding and we still have friend and family talk about how amazing our wedding was. Seriously book a date fast cuz you don’t want to miss out on this place! It’s a hidden gem for sure!</Review>< Pictures>

Thank you everyone for making my wedding day MORE than I dreamed of.<//text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO208HefkOIyPDvX-_GLpg-UAW90YAOXss8cecm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrpsrjuPC6kHnWZ6sbY4XkXKaB-bSWXbnWRKbM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBnyHhAMF8i35gfUM9vwg0qJk89VBZvmMSGUOw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9wrXH5Qz3wjFLDNabemPTN35lueXUTEK4Zmy5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1Mb1SSnrmCTH0WmKbRsa-dbWbP0BrXVdAErVQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8783D7SvEnsfZgHomza8BUA3CJuVpKMHYiWfX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMU3Y5qWrgEXkIRWZDYg96V4_-mtME83r0FTrLV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1GhQHFY8ssT5AsDccNjEkOh8LgK8uYgYiELa1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPU15ekZDa8-6xsUWFvNiRnFw6ACgndiIRjlUg4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOurBJ_A49mb83gHzbBJVUQP5Wm3ciYryJ-21z2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxP7uRen7FHoYCOqnYHM7jfLKmLsdUMZtyRiPi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZwUCGg1IRQji8h5qBYS2ivjtyGqUg8gDQOhMo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcNhhfTnV5s0n__cQYuUraky9yOVI-i2O858oS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWVW_E4yL-0nqc897DXAXcBfgR1UEAsJYrP2sL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrJUxHOBLh0fQ2ImC8J_1gY93cS0ivxdrPGrXf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1Cb7KPq7qk0i4yUrRhAx6nErLWV2TpGDVpXnA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<user_id>103179134803800246641< /user_id><text>The entire Wedgewood team made our day PERFECTLY seamless, stress-free & special!! We could not ask for more!! The team, service/hospitality, food, drinks, decorations, venue & everything else completely exceeded our expectations!!

I'm a liiiittle bit of a control freak when it comes to decoration details, but felt totally at ease with the Wedgewood staff handling it all & I was blown away by how beautiful & romantic everything turned out! We felt completely taken care of throughout the entire day. Our guests raved about how beautiful the venue is & how amazing the food, drinks & staff were.

Everyone working our wedding made such a phenomenal team & I can't say enough great things about our whole experience! We truly appreciate how sincere each team member was-- that goes a long way! We know Wedgewood does tons of weddings each week, so the fact that the entire team made us feel like ours was unique, special, important & didn't get lost in the masses meant a lot to us! Thank you for making our dream wedding a reality & helping us make the most heartfelt, happy memories that we'll always cherish together!!

WE LOVE WEDGEWOOD GALWAY!!</text><Rate>5< /Rate><Pics>None</Pics><GmapID>0x80db827dbd18cf51:0x69c88d522e76bc0b< /GmapID>< Resp>

Buyer beware: friends had to reschedule, due to covid. The venue refused to reschedule and took the large down. This company is cut-throat, go elsewhere.<//Text>

Please make sure you are going to be able to have your wedding when you book. The entire event is non-refundable and they will stick to that no matter what the situations is. My fiance' has an extreme medical emergency and we needed to cancel the wedding and they are cold blooded about giving money back. I understand I signed a contract but no food was made, no flowers, cake, nothing more then a little planning. Just cold blooded money hungry company.<//text>

Beware of deceitful tactics used by a bait-and-switch process.  Call center told the bride that the date she wanted was "never an issue", so after driving 1.5 hours out there, we toured the facility (which is really nice), and sat down with the consultant, who then proceeded to tell us that they date they wanted was not available.  The consultant then tried to change couple's mind to getting married on a Monday!  It's unprofessional, deceitful, and disrespectful to operate a business this way.<//text>

<Review>I was overwhelmed by the kindness of Nathan at California Cookout. I booked the Company to cater my husband's celebration of life. Nathan himself came and he was understanding and compassionate. More importantly, perhaps the food was fantastic. I didn't have to worry about anything. They set everything up, they broke everything down. It was the easiest and best decision I ever made to have California Cookout cater. So many people came up to me to tell me how great the food was. I highly recommend them to any one who is having any type of event.< /Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< username>

California Cookout catered to my wedding this past weekend. Although planning a wedding during this time was not easy at all, I can definitely say that working with Nathan made the process much easier. Nathan is very easy to work with, he will listen to you and try to work within your budget. Price is great, and food is even better. In fact, the food tasted better at my wedding day than when I went in for tasting! My guests loved the food and I heard many of them went for their 2nd plate.
I’m so glad that I chose Cal Cookout as my wedding caterer. I would highly recommend Nathan and his team to anyone planning their special event.</Text>

California Cookout was absolutely amazing at my daughter's birthday. The food was amazing! I got so many compliments on the dinner, especially the trip-tip, seasoned potatoes and the delicious cobbler and ice scream they served for dessert. They will be on top of my list for all my future events. And Nathan is so pleasant and super nice to work with.< /review>

Getting a quote was super easy and fast. Nathan is very responsive by email and phone, making communicating easy and effective. The food is great, my fiancé and I went to a tasting and we immediately decided that we had to book them. I can not wait to work with them in the future.< /text>

The only thing better than their food, is their service. We were 60 days away from our wedding when we postponed due to COVID-19. Nathan and Cal Cookout have exceeded our highest expectations by demonstrating excellent customer service including friendly professionalism, prompt communication, and flexible accommodations.
We could rave about their easy booking process, value of affordable pricing, or the outstanding taste of their delicious tri-tip, savory vegetables, refreshing salad, and mouth-watering mashed potatoes; but the primary reason my fiance and I highly recommend Nathan and California Cookout for all of your catering needs; is because they have restored our optimism for our future wedding in 2021.</text>

<user_name>Amanda Fabre</user_name><time>1598558203065<//time><rate>5<//rate><Text>If you are looking for a caterer for any event, California Cookout is definitely the way to go. We initially reached out to him about catering our wedding and he invited us to one of his tastings. The food was absolutely delicious (uhm... they serve warm bread, how can you not go with them?). I would highly recommended going to one of the tastings. Nathan collaborates with other small business and we even found our wedding cake vendor through the tasting. He even let us come twice... to bring our parents and get the final stamp of approval!

Unfortunately, due to COVID we had to postpone our May 2020 wedding, but they have been great about postponing our event. This is a + in my book, because I've heard sooo many stories from other brides about vendors not being communicative or flexible with them. We really appreciate how above and beyond Nathan has gone for us. This is a company we would love to use for events in the future.

As far as the food, the menus have a lot of variety which is awesome. They are also very willing to work within your budget. We went with the tri-tip & grilled chicken (which are carved onsite during dinner service) and the upgraded sides. Nathan was very accommodating with food allergies/substitutions. We have a couple guests with nut allergies and he agreed that their salads would be served/dressed separately as the salad contained walnuts. In addition, we have some vegetarians in attendance and ordered a veggie lasagna as an add on.

Overall, the value and quality of the food is spot on. It was very easy and straightforward to get a quote and book for the event. Communication has been great, and we truly appreciate the flexibility during this time. :)</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c34db2ebd8d0d5:0x44d1f5e9bbf8f1b0</gmap_id></record>

I highly recommend California Cookout Catering to anyone looking for a great catered meal for a large group.  They are easy to work with, and show up on time, and keep things moving.  They are well prepared, and everything they make is delicious.   They set up, serve, and take down quietly as well, so they are not disturbing any ongoing activities.  5 Stars for sure!</text>

California Cookout has definitely become a highly recognized name within our organization for the fabulous meals prepared.  Nathan could not be more professional.  He greets everyone with a smile.  He's fantastic to work with!  I highly recommend California Cookout Catering for ANY event!< /review>

<review>The California Cookout Catering was amazing!!! We had them cater my daughter's wedding and Nathan was such a joy to work with!! We weren't easy clients, as divorced parents, and he made the catering decisions run smoothly. He went out of his way to accommodate us. The food was delicious!!! All of our guest raved about how great it was. I would 100% have them cater another event for us and recommended them to everyone who likes to eat great food! Thank you Nathan!!!!< /review></record>

We had a great experience with California Cookout Catering at our wedding in 2018.  The owner, Nathan, met with us to go over the menu and answered all of our questions.  His caterers were prompt and professional, and Nathan himself was able to help serve and oversee everything.  The pricing was so reasonable, and the food was absolutely delicious.  I was so happy I contracted California Cookout to cater our wedding.<//Text>

Food has always been better than GREAT.  More importantly the customer service, not only at the event has been wonderful, the communication leading up to the events is what sets them apart from other caterers.<//Review>

I went online and picked the unit I wanted and then proceeded to the location to finish up the paperwork.  The unit was exactly as described, clean and easy to access.  From the time I arrived to the time I left the experience was perfect.  I would highly recommend this facility over any of the others in the area.</review>

Moved here recently to Fort Irwin. There was no storage so I scrambled for a place. I am very glad I came here. The site was completely secure with security cameras. My car and motorcycle sat for a month with no issues. The facility is clean and well cared for. The staff was very nice and remembered my name as well. Good people, good place.  The price was right as well, there was no nickel  and dime add ons, no contracts.< /Text>

Right space didn't even offer an apology and of course my responsibility to fix it. I get that but the gal at the desk said they were broken into on a regular basis...that would have been nice to know. Also they didn't file a police report..suscpious. looking at other Right Space facilities other tenants had the same complaints..really suscpious.<//text>< user_name>

<review>Friendly employees, easy access, great price!

Something that will be helpful inside storage better lighting! I usually have to use flashlight to see items inside of storage. That is not why I left. I had few items in storage not worth storing on monthly basis.

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>NO STARS BUT IT WOULDNT LET ME POST DONT COME HERE!!! All these people had to say that because it used to be leave a review & get 10 dollars off. Well, now they don't have that any more! So, here is the truth. They give you a great rate whenever you come in then they jack the prices so high about _$20.00 every 6 months to a year. And they did it to me twice in one year a year ago. I've been with them for more than 4 years and my price has went from 90.00 to 200.00 okay. Want to get ripped off and watch the girls bid or call dibs on other people stuff that they just lost, while the manager doesn't know or care, while laughing at the people who lost their stuff. While prices go up you know why because those 2 girls Bragg babout yeah I told him he better give me a paid lunch and we need a place to have lunch , plus yeah it's costing him a lot of money but whatever. I just moved my stuff , finally got a bigger house. The things I know.</Review>< response>

I rented a unit for 2 1/2 years after moving back from Neveda, customer service was always on point. Management was always professional and the facilities were always clean and well taken care of. I'd recommend RightSpace Storage to anyone needing a place to store their possessions.<//review>

The most professional, patience and friendly Eye Doctors I have ever had! Doctors take time to exam and explain every details of all my concerns. The other staffs are friendly and professional on what they do. I have been seen my eye doctors here for many years, and always very happy with their service! I would recommend their service to anyone who is looking for the best! Many thanks!<//review>

I had a very nice appointment today. In this day and age, it is hard to find a really good team and I certainly found it with WSOG!  I didn't feel like it was an appointment at all, felt like I was among friends.  I was with my old optometric group for 25+ years and when I moved, I found Warm Springs Optometric Group, they now see my daughter and shortly, my son!  Thank you so much for everything you do!<//Review>

Dr. Pirrone always spends a lot of time with me to understand how my vision is doing in all aspects of my life.  She listens and then not only takes care of ensuring that my contacts and glasses have the appropriate prescription, but she also makes sure that my lifestyle is minimally impacted by my vision.  Dr. Pirrone also takes the time to go over my retina scan so that I understand what is going on with my eyes as they age.  I always enjoy my visits with her and my eye health couldn't be better.

The staff at Warm Springs Optometric is excellent.  They are courteous and efficient.  I always feel welcome and they handle their tasks, my tests, and any questions beyond my expectations.  They also fully understand my vision insurance and work with me to be sure I am maximizing the benefits that my plan allows.

I can't imagine going anywhere else for my vision needs.< /text>< Rating>

I have been going to see Dr. Pirrone since I was probably about 11 or 12. She is very kind and thorough with her work. I just took my son to see her about some vision issues he has been having and got to see how kind and patient she is with the kiddos. The rest of the staff there are also very nice and helpful! I will always recommend her!<//Text>

<Text>New patient to this group. It was a nice smooth transition from my retiring optometrist. I felt very comfortable and the new advice for contact care and my eye health has already made a difference. I felt Dr. Pirrone listened to where I was in my eye journey and did not miss a beat to help me move forward successfully. There was not pressure to change contact lens makers, nor buy unneeded glasses.  Thank you for the smooth transition!</Text>< user>

Dr. Pirrone really takes good care of me and always goes the extra mile. Since I am a "complex case", I am rightfully concerned about my eye care. Dr. Pirrone is my "go-to" doc for most of my eye needs and is a great source of comfort to have for concerns or questions.< /review>

< review>
I give a 4-5 for the Dr.'s attention while I am in the office, but for the prices and for the front desk service, I give it a 1. They were very nice as long as I was their customer and the moment I requested for a prescription for a second opinion since their average costs were coming up more than 2000, they went all cold on me. The person on the phone was very rude, non apologetic for unavailable service. Wow, I do not ever want to talk to a person like that. Glad it was on phone and I would probably cried if it was in person.<//review>

<Time>1616002792012<//Time><rating>5<//rating><review>different optometrists as I changed my jobs at locations, although still in the bay area but at distances from Fremont.  I have always been very careful on choosing the best possible optometrist as my prescriptions are fairly deep and I am very carefully on taking care of my eyes. I am in micro-optics industry, working on tiny optics and components. I examine my eyes every year and change my glasses every two years.
In recent years I have gradually found that the new glasses cannot bring my vision back. I had brought this issue to my optometrist who then had tried different prescriptions to resolve the issue. My prescriptions are getting deeper and deeper, with astigmatisms adding on. But I still suffer the same problem.
When I came back to Dr. Pirrone in 2018 for a consultation, she immediately fund out the problem with my eyes after a thorough examination and introduced me to an eye surgent. During the period of choosing the right amount of correction at surgery, I had consulted Dr. Pirrone several times and she had given me many suggestions and performed many tests to settled down the right corrections for the surgery, and calmed down my anxiety.
Now I am vision is completely back and I am very happy with the surgery result. Dr. Pirrone is far more than a top-notch optometrist. She loves her job and she really cares about her patents!< /review>< pics>

Both Drs. are really interested in listening to your concerns and helping you.  They're very knowledgable and they stay up to date on the latest  eye information.  I have spent years with Drs. who weren't interested in helping me see better, they were just wasting my time.</Text>

{'time': 1574809435657, 'text': "Hello Chanakya,\n\nThank you for your feedback. We can understand the frustration with a cancellation fee. However,  this is not a new policy, and it is a very common policy for offices to have a same day cancellation fee. We also remind patients of this policy during their appointment reminders and it's printed on all appointment reminder cards. The reason being, we cannot offer your appointment time to another patient in need because it is such a last minute cancellation.\n\nThe end of the year is an especially busy time. We have had to turn patients down because of our booked schedule. To make it fair for all of our patients we ask all confirmed appointments, like yours, to be kept. We offer our patients many reminders, starting from several weeks in advance, to help reschedule should you need to.\n\nWe try our best to run a fair practice and help as many of our patients as possible. This one star is an anomaly for us and we hope this explanation helped put things into perspective. Each of our patients matter to us so feel free to reach out to our team at info@optometristfremont.com should you have any further questions or suggestions. We always strive for a 5-star experience.\n\nWe hope you feel better and have a happy Thanksgiving with your loved ones,\n\nWarm Springs Optometric Group"}<//response>

<text>I felt sad that place like this could be so bad the doctor did the exam and I never saw her again after that. I was in the office 3 times to get my glasses and each time they were wrong.The first 2 times the lens were to thick. the third time the bifocal lens was not correct.I had made an appointment  to see the doctor to check the bifocal part again  45 minutes before my appointment the office called and canceled my appointment. I took an hour off work to go there and 45 minutes before they call and said that the doctor does not want to see you and the lab who messed them up to start with would not remake them again. The doctor said the prism was left out by the lab. if this was the case why didn't she send them back to be remade.I will never go back there again and if you are reading this don't go there!!!!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><user_name>Richard Vicente<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

I have been going to them for ages and feel their professionalism and good humor make for a very human experience.  When Dr. Pirrone discovered that I had a serious eye issue, she worked quickly to get me in contact with specialists that could do more for me.  She followed up and made me that I had someone watching out for me.

Those people who think the numbers are called too fast don't belong at a serious bingo hall.  If your not a pro ~ don't go!  My friend and I just last night found out they reopened last month. Our lives have a meaning again. Look out here we come!<//text>

<Text>Adult Bingo, is a little more complicated than the kids bingo! The staff is amazing, helped us start our games. We couldn’t keep up with all the great players siting around us. Definitely have to come back and practice. A very fast game. $1 a game, not bad, winning range from $200-500
A game. Fun to visit and play.</Text><Time>1586029708684<//Time><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dd2dd157f84199:0x33077b04f6513c31</GmapID><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

Since it's re-opening,  I'm not digging it to much.  They require you to play 2 packs ($50) per session.   Yet, they call at the same pace as if you were only playing one.  I can keep up, but I've seen some people struggle to do so.   They don't allow anyone to help you either (play one of your packs).  They have a no food/drinks at the cubicle policy...but no water bottles is REDICULOUS...dry mouth!

Forget about going to the restroom.. they restrict how many people can go in..1 or 2 at any time..  So you better drink some H2O and pee at home before you come.  Ijs< /Text>

The monitor was not working. The way they set everything was Blurred that you can see the number. No drink at the table. Sale was nice or professional. They keep on sale to the same person. Ever time you call them they walk away. When was out of all the pull tabs that they sale I 4 pull games to play. And it my first time there. I won't recommend anyone to go there I spent $700 on Sunday 28 of March.  It a horrible experience.  Other casino are more better the Hawaiian gardens.  Worker don't understand English. It will be the last time I will go there.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Fast paced. You should learn to play somewhere else first. Not saying it's difficult, for the best seasoned pro, just saying if you're new, I'd wait and play at church first.  I personally love the fast pace.  Come and go as you please. Pull tabs and great friendly atmosphere!< /review>

Can get crowded but fun place. Super cheap prices and good food. Can go quick so kinda hard to keep up if ur new to it, but the people around you normally help explain the games if you don't know how to play. They have the kitchen part but ppl also walk around with carts were you can buy the food to. Plus free hot coo coo and coffee<//text>

<Review>This is at Hawaiian Gardens and the play is extremely fast. Staying up with the caller is difficult the first few times or more. However. If you are a good reader by seeing the whole page at a time like speed reading then you will manage easily with litt practice.
It can get frustrating as the people call out BINGO when you just have a square or 2 left when that happens. Or BINGO is yelled out when it seems the game just got going.
Regardless, imagine what you would do with the money and get a clear picture. Hold onto that thought and tell yourself you are a WINNER. The truth is you keep going back and you will WIN and always have fun fun fun and be happy for the other winners. Now go win.
By the way I believe that if you want something to eat while you play it is best you bring it with you because eats are not served at the Bingo.<//Review><date>1556204262068<//date><Response>None<//Response><userid>117684568378651274076</userid></record>

Different ways to play bingo, game cards start at $1 and some are $2. Very quiet place other than the voice of the bingo announcer.

<review>Very nice people-helpful and a great atmosphere. But they call bingo entirely too fast as if they want you to miss bingo to collect as much money as possible. It's like Bingo on steroid!!!! I'll stick with my normal bingo halls.</review>< name>

Winner winner chicken dinner! Fun but they go way to fast. I'd play more often if they slowed down just a bit. They go so fast you probably had a bingo but didn't realize until it was too late. I don't like to play super slow but this place is bingo on crack. I do like you can buy in game by game.</review>

<Name>Michael Uribe</Name><Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Okay so this was my first time to a bingo parlor so take my review with a grain of salt.  On the outside the place is pretty nice, plenty of parking and well lit.  The inside is nothing special, just a giant room with long rows of tables setup.  There is a small food bar to get food and drinks, an outside patio to smoke and play at the same time, and an announcers booth.  There are also people that go around with food and drink carts in case you don't want to leave your seat.

Now I don't know about other bingo places but this place was fast paced!  Like super fast paced.  The show the number on the screen and announce it and immediately move along.  There were some times I wasn't able to keep up and missed some numbers because of it.  They play several games, each winning you $250 with some special games of $500.  The crowd is mainly older but very friendly.  I didn't win anything but still had a pretty good time.  I wouldn't recommend this place for beginners like myself, it's just too fast paced and confusing when you are still trying to learn the game.  If you're a seasoned bingo pro then this is the place for you.< /Review>< userid>

My favorite bingo spot but they got too many floor specials it's starting to seem like a $2 bingo club instead of the $1 per paper it's known for. Still love the fact you can leave whenever you want to.</Text>

Don't blink. You might miss your bingo. I always enjoy playing at the Bingo Club. You will find all the bingo drama here. Like people saving seats and act like there friend is coming . I bullied my way into a seat and ended with a BiGG tab solo winner.. Enjoy</review>

There is no buy-in so you can play as many games as you want and then leave.  They also sell "pull tabs".  However....they sell TOO MANY pull tabs!!  They should change the name to "The Pull Tab Club".  The Bingo Club discovered that they can get rich from pull tabs.  People are addicted to the tabs and as long as people buy em, they sell em.   People in general believe that if they buy the tabs that they are winning.  You will Never beat the house  in the game of bingo and pull tabs .

The Bingo Club needs to go back to the days when they played "Bingo".
That will never happen, because people are addicted to the tabs and they know it.  If people would stop buying them, maybe it would help?</text></record></dataset><record>

Its a great.place. for someone who has experience W/today's Bingo. This nothing like the past.This place is consider the fastest game in town. Believe me it is.You can spend a large cash of money here. A dollar a game. Adds up quick. If you don't know how to play it is not the place to learn.The people that play do not have the time show you so you can not depend on that.if you decide to come.Come with about $50 cash leave your.ATM cards at home.It is so easy to spend anywhere from !$50-$500 in one night. Mark.my words.<//Text>

Really fast and fun. If you haven't played Bingo in a while bring a friend and share a card. Most games are a $1 and pay out $250. Go later and tge payout is higher. Friday the pay out is $500 and most games cost $1. Set limits on how much you want to spend and have a good time.< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>This is very fast paced bingo, so definitely be prepared. This was the first time we've ever been and it was slightly intimidated. Each round has specific things in order to win, so try to sit next to someone who knows. Luckily the woman near us was friendly and willing to help when we needed. They have a sheet with each rounds bingo type, so make sure to grab one of these. It is also play per round, so if you need to sit out and take a brake you don't pay for that round. I think the fast pace makes it more exciting than normal, and definitely makes it more addicting!< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Love it.  I just wish they would explain more about the pull tabs before the Sellers go on the floor. I like the tabs that you play as a game. BUT not the ones that you only win if you have the last number called on a bingo game. I never know ahead so I just don't but them.
The players that go there every week know which ones they are by the name of the pull tab but us that do not, well we miss out and bingo club doesn't get our money...... Plz make a change or put the info on the sheet that lists the bingo games....< /text>

love the bingo club but i have a real issue with the callers insulting my ans yhe other patrons intelligence by stalling in between games. They bost fastest game in town but at tbe end of the night it slows down considerably and thw intervals between games are ridiculous. We the patrons see the sellers are finished giving out papers and yet the last caller  uses any and every excuse to say "just a few moments for the blah blah blah it gets old. I still love to play bingo here otherwise and the chocolate chip cookies are everything so make sure to get one at rhe snack bar< /text>

If you can handle how fast they go than you'll love it. Games are $1-$2 depending with payouts between $250-500 depending on the day and time that you go. The Pull Tabs pay between $250-$1500, but most pay $1199.  More often than not your fellow players sitting around you will help you if your not sure how to play anday even spot a Bingo before you do. The food is what you would find at a food truck and is ok if your really hungry but they have free coffee, tea, and water of course. There's also a smoking section if that's what you're in to. We go often and we've won often. What can I say? It's addicting.<//Review>

I WAS BANNED BECAUSE SOME REASON THAT  THEY HAD. IT IS VERY SCARRY PLACE TO GO AND YOU CAN PLAY BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO WIN THERE BECAUSE THE CLUB HAS TOO MANY FRIGHTENING PEOPLE ALL TRYING TO WIN. AND THEY MAKE IT BAD TO BE IN THE CLUB OR DO ANYTHING THAT THEY DON'T LIKE. ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK IF YOU LIKE LOOSING. THANKS BINGO CLUB.</Review>

I like the extreme fast calling. But the other players can be rude &  not so sure if some winners aren't set to win....especially with nightly drawings< /Review>

The workers are rude, pull tab games and runners are unorganized and pass up players but go back to the players they know will tip them otherwise they just ignore us if they don't know us, and  it's really hard to understand the callers  because they talk and call too fast<//Text>
