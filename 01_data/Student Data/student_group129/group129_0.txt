Good fro-yo shop.   Very clean.  Staff has always been friendly.   The flavors change often, but we have always been able to find something we like.   It can get expensive, but there are usually coupons available though mailers and there is a loyalty program available which offers a lot of bonus discounts.< /text>

<date>1602730608156<//date><rating>1< /rating><Text>I wanted to treat my grandson with a frozen yogurt. My husband buys from them every week. They refused to serve me because the small chi in ld with me wasn’t wearing a mask. They offered to Sell me a mask for 50cents. These are the free masks issued by the county of Riverside.  My grandson was so upset. He said he would ‘sit in the car and wait for me’. The shop was empty. No one else was there!!! This is the last time I will go into this shop. We went to Albertsons and got a delicious frozen yogurt from them. They have lost my family’s business and I have told all my friend about the appalling way they treated a 4 year old child.<//Text>< pics>

<Response>{'time': 1602875132126, 'text': 'Amanda, we are a small family owned business that has been a proud member of, and partner with, this wonderful community for the past 12 years.  As you can imagine, this has been a very difficult time for small businesses.  We work very hard to provide the same quality yogurt, great customer service in a clean environment, that we always have.   At this time everyone over the age of two must wear a face covering while inside stores.  We have this posted clearly on our front door as well as alternative options we offer for those who, for any reason, will not wear a mask.  While we respect your feelings, we will continue to abide by the current mandates and health guidelines that are required of businesses, like we have always done...both for the safety and well being of our customers and employees, but also to protect our business.  Also, just to clarify, we do offer masks for 50 cents to those who do not have one, if they choose.  As the cost of masks have gone down since this began we have adjusted our prices.  We do not make a profit on masks, we simply offer them at our cost.   In fact, while many stores and restaurants have raised their prices due to the pressures of Covid-19, we have thus far, worked very hard to keep our prices the same.   We are truly sorry to lose the business of your family and that your grandson was disappointed, but we hope when this is over (and no one wants that more than us) you will give us another try.

<review>The staff are friendly and they do fundraising for chaparral every once in a while. They give you discount for chaparral asb holders and they have good toppings to choose.Its a great place to stop if you want to talk and chill with friends for a bit outside while you have some fro-yo.<//review><name>AshyKatSans< /name>< UserId.>

We have been coming here for years and have recently experienced less than acceptable customer service. I’ve also been advised by former employees that we should not be coming here for many reasons. Sadly, we will not be returning.<//Text>

We’re regulars and usually love the friendly staff. We came in on a Wednesday night, Jan. 8th, around 9:00. The girl who was working the register was very snarky, rude and impatient when we were trying to pay. After paying, we went to sit at a table and she tells us (not politely), “Don’t spill anything on the tables because I wiped them down already and we’re closing soon.” Maybe she forgot when her store closes, but it was barely 9:15 and they close at ten. She wasn’t wearing a name tag so I can’t name names or make any call to a manager about it. Maybe they can check the schedule. Someone needs to train their staff on customer service.<//Review>

We have been to this place several times and mostly when the kids invite us to go.  My children enjoy the outside seating; a perfect place to hang out, especially during summer.

The self-serve dispensers come with loads of yogurt flavors. There are mini sample cups readily available to try each tang.

For consumer seeking seasonal limited-time flavor like myself, the factory has the pumpkin froyo.  We love the seasonal flavors as they trigger excitement, which in this case, make us look forward to the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays.

There are a variety of toppings to choose that spurs creativity. I always get the cheesecake in cubes, which is constantly stored in the fridge to keep it fresh.  A scoop of garden-fresh blueberries and coconut jelly to add makes the dessert healthy and enjoyable to eat.

Then, there are the spoons that change color as it reacts to cold yogurt temperatures continue to keep us entertained.

The staff members here are personable and never fail to greet each time we visit.   The place and the bathroom are clean, which speaks a lot about the establishment.

Not only is the pricing is fairly reasonable, the froyo parlor also offers 25% discount to Yelper users (a plus) and 10% discount to firefighters and military service members.

This is by far the best yogurt chain in the Temecula area.<//Text>

The very best yogurt - quality, variety, flavors.  Hands down!

Yogurt Factory always has the best yogurts in town.  A great variety of flavors and toppings, and at least one low-carb flavor.
The are very generous, too.  They use a punch card/frequent buyer system, along with the SpotOn application, so its easy to earn free yogurt.  They also offer coupons for email and Instagram customers.  They offer a great value for the money.  Favorite flavors are Pistachio Pudding and Creamy Coconut, but they are all delicious!

I feel like I'm giving away a great secret, but Yogurt Factory really is the best frozen yogurt in the valley!< /text>

I went during covid 19. They have all the safe guards covered. Temperature check. Logs. 6 feet of spacing. The staff were all wearing masks and ask you to do the same. When I arrived they asked me to put my name on the list and wait outside. I said "no problem". Went to get a phone battery out of my car and one of ladies came running out after me, I think she thought I was leaving. That's O.K. because that is great service and someone who appreciates her customers.</Text>< Pics>

Been to all the barber shops on Sierra and I do have to say that, I can see why they've lasted this long. Super friendly staff. They always have plenty of stylists on duty. I love that they ask plenty of questions and dont just start chopping away. Language barrier for non spanish speakers? Not at all, they have bilingual people so people like me feel comfortable with communications. Show them a photo and you will get whats in the picture to the T.< /review>

<Review>I've been going there for years but this time I walked in was a really bad service not only did that lady have a face that didn't even want to be there she pretty much talk so rude and talk to another co-worker like she owned the place which I know she does not I feel bad because the other worker is way older than her. Not only did you give attitude to her worker but I did two tours a customer I always go and ask for Vicky because she is the best there's also Hector and his wife which are pretty good but this time none of them were there so I let that lady cut my hair not only did she not do her job as I asked but the whole time she had a face with an attitude she would talk to me with an attitude not even let me answer her back I will keep going there but only because I like you picking and it's really hard to find someone like her but I will never let that lady cut my hair or any of my family members too bad I don't know her name she's just the one that's next to Hector's wife other than that everybody there has a great personality</Review>< Pics>

Been coming here last 20 years, been 3-4 years since the last time that I was here. This shop is so filthy hair covering the floor. I called the shop asked how much a cut was just to see what they would say cause when I went in the board said $10 when she charged me receipt said $12 so I didn't bother to tip after i noticed that. place is shady dirty..... theyve lost my business forever<//text>

Went in on 9/20 for a hair cut. No one even acknowledged me when I walked in. So I sat down, 20 mins later still nothing. I got up and started walking out before the a male barber yelled across the room and said just wait a little longer, you'll be next. Yeah right, I'll go somewhere else.<//Text>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) They took a bad job. With my girlfriend's hair paint. With the bleach I don't use the brush, she put it on the hair as if it were shampoo. And to this day it still burns and his hair is falling apart. Bad job iso. And also, he still has paint in his hair, they were not good, I do not recommend going to that to paint his hair.

Asieron un mal trabajo. Con la pintura de cabello de mi novia. Con el bleach no uso la brocha lo puso en el cabello como si fuera shampoo. Y hasta hoy toda vía le arde y se le anda cállendo el cabello. Un mal trabajo iso. Y también toda vía tiene pintura en el pelo no se lo sieron bien.No recomiendo ir a que para pintarse el pelo.😠< /Review>

I do not know if they were trying to be ironic, but this is not a "coin less" laundromat. There are machines to get change in quarters. If you think you can be productive on your laptop or stream on your phone, this particular location did not let me use my Verizon network, nor my backup Visible phone reliably. While this is not their fault, it's just a heads up to anyone with that in mind. They have small and large washers where you can try to limit the number of loads you may have to wash, but at $3 and $5.50 respectively, I would say this is pretty expensive. It would be nice if they provided wifi access as a perk. Otherwise the machines still look new, but I may be looking to try other laundromats. Also last wash is at 8:30, which feels a little early although they close at 10pm.< /text>

<review>Clean and has in site personall that can help you if theirs a issue with the machines. Really clean restroom as well as a sink🚰 where you can wash your hands and napkins to dry.The dryers are amazing to dry no matter what side you choose to dry youl find one that might not be as hot as the rest but in my opinion youl find them working very well🧺The prices can go from small 1.75 med 5.25 and 6.50 and bigger loads start at 7.50 the water cicles have cold, warm, and hot. It has a folding area down the middle and also carts that can go outside to your car. Cleanest place I have found and has great WORKING PERSONELL that provide great CUSTOMER SERVICE .My number one place to do my laundry.....💯👌👍</review>< pics>

I would definitely not recommend this laundry. Specially at nights. There's a lady that seems that she hates her job and doesnt like the fact that people ask her questions about the washer machines either when people needs change. Its not the 1st and 2nd time happends . I asked her for change and she didn't like the fact that I ask her for change,when I wanted to wash at 8:15p.m. the first word she said to me: I close at 9:45p.m.  serously? Is thisis how you trat your customers?. If you dont like your job quit orri really hope you get fire.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) The laundry is very clean, the workers do an excellent job keeping the place in good condition, the only thing is the parking lot, there are people who come to park there and go to eat at the restaurant on the other side and whenever I arrive there is little free parking because It is full of those who are going to eat at the restaurant that is in the other place and not in the laundry room.

(Original)
Esta muy limpia la lavanderia, las trabajadoras hacen un exelente trabajo manteniendo en buen estado el lugar, lo unico el estacionamiento hay gente que se viene a estacionar alli y se van a comer al restaurant al otro lado y siempre que llego hay poco estacionamiento libre xque esta lleno de los que van a comer al restaurant que esta en el otro sitio y no en el sitio de la lavanderia.< /review>

I had ordered a square cut pizza for my nephew, who for whatever reason loves square cut pizza. Didn’t get that, got regular. However, they offered to fix the problem but hands me back double sliced regular. Where is the square? Then on top of that they were using their hands to sprinkle the cheese. If you ran out of gloves, close the shop until you get more especially during covid. Won’t be ordering from here anymore.</text>

I have heard mixed Customer Service reviews about this location from members of my Firm, along with some from family and friends, so I decided to investigate for myself. Today I ordered an online Special that included Cheese Sticks. I specifically requested that the Garlic Sauce come with the sticks, instead of the default pizza sauce. When I received the order there was pizza sauce in the box, although my receipt and the order sticker attached to the box clearly stated Garlic Sauce. When I showed the "large, heavy-set" elderly fellow--clearly one of the pizza makers, based on his attire--the box label and pizza sauce he replied "Oh, you want something else?!" I told him I just wanted what I ordered. So the now clearly disturbed pizza maker grabs a garlic sauce container from under the counter, and without making eye contact chucks the container in my direction. When I thank him, he ignores me and walks away. So I say "it's 'You're welcome', Sir.", he tells me "You're done. Goodbye". I guess the Garlic Sauce was coming out of his check or something! To add insult to injury, the "All the Meats" pizza I ordered had not one sliver of pepperoni or bacon on it--just sausage, ham and cheese! In any event, it would seem the rumors were true. My firm will be cutting off any continued donations to any Papa John's programs and this location will be recognized via letter sent Papa's Corporate Leadership. The 'customer' only asked for what was ordered, guys. It's only a sauce container, yet the 'employee' made it into an issue. Missing toppings is unacceptable, especially when there is a chart regarding which toppings go on Specialties posted above your pizza prep station.</review>

Whenever  I want to go to a good lunchon, this restaurant comes instantly to my head. superb and diverse  food and a large menu.well mannered crew, and agreeable vibes. And very important, the pay is honest. I sent my friends to this restaurant with great pleasure.</Text>

< review>
We called in and ordered under the name Thomas, Hannah. When we reached the store; there was no order in that name. The items we ordered was under the name Thomas, Brittney. Had to wait for a few minutes!! Why to call and order, if we have to wait. Because of the COVID situation, I waited outside the store where they could see me. They should have called me or waved at me when the order was ready. They did not. I went in and inquired. They handed over the box which was ready for full five minutes. I asked them for extra pepper. They said they would charge 81 cents. A dollar for one single Jalapeno Pepper !! That is too much after I paid 25 dollars for a Pizza....
The Pizza tastes good but, the attitude of the Pizza girl left a sour aftertaste!!</review>

The young lady that took my order of a bbq chicken Papadia, she was amazing. She even brought it to my car to keep the store empty. She didn't give me a recept, so don't know her name, but she was great. Thank you.<//text>

It's best if you pick up, delivery is a option but both times I got it delivered I was last to receive my food and had to reheat it. Doesn't make me very happy since I usually have a 4:50 delivery fee from Papa John's and then I also usually give the driver's about 4 bucks so that's 850 to be last in line I wasn't happy< /text>

<review>Apparently there was some confusion when ordering over the phone as to the deals. When I arrived, there was confusion about that as well as some computer issues. The staff though busy was polite and helped to work through it. Bottom line Rudy made it right.</review>< Pics>

Phenomenal Food... Horrible Service... The Manager on duty tonight informed me he's new to this location. Barely transferred here 6 months ago. This explains my whole experience. Well it looks like they lost a longtime local customer. He didn't wanna give any names or numbers to his superiors so it's fine. I'll take my business elsewhere... Grade D+<//text>

food & service: very poor, they sent my business the WRONG ORDER and the Manager of Store#1993, BRENDA was rude and did not even seem in the slightest to care about making my order correct.  WHAT HAS BECOME OF PAPA JOHNS!!!!???? I HAVE LIVED IN RANCHO CUCAMONGA DAMN NEAR MY WHOLE LIFE and never been treated this badly!!!!!!  she didnt remake the items they didn't send ranch for (i payed extra for this rancho 2, which wasnt there)    ALSO they sent me some girl named megan's pizza (which was pretty gross btw megan ur not missin out on much, but i was so hungry i still ate half)

i wasted an hour and a half of my peaceful life stressin about papa johns pizza.

LONG STUPID STORY LATER ->  just goto a different papa johns not the one on foothill blvd very fkn horrible experience with the Manager BRENDA   !

after all that they sent me the ranch i originally ordered, an hour late.  and also they sent me the pizza i originally ordered, an hour late.  but i have a stomach ache from BRENDA and the first crap the should have shipped to megan!

<name>Daniel Montespierre<//name><Time>1608446119401< /Time><rating>5< /rating><review>Product variety is super diverse from books to home security, and customer experience is really good. It’s odd at first, because my first impulse was “I could’ve clicked and had it shipped” but - there’s SO MUCH stuff that I soon got over it. And it’s neat to actually see paper books so well represented.
The prices are printed super tiny. Older folk like my parents would have trouble reading these. Jeff, please have these enlarged for better ergonomics.

There was a line outside the Amazon store today on Saturday, but it moved reasonably quickly, and the employee at the entrance was friendly (see the guy in my photo) answering all our questions as we waited to enter. He explained the store concept, and how products were ordered within the store.
When we entered, another employee greeted us and that if we had any questions to let her know. A third employee was helping another customer about HDMI, bandwidth, etc and he appeared knowledgeable to me, I work in tech.

We took two trips around the store, filled up a basket, and the pleasant guy at the checkout line was super courteous and helpful. No name on the receipt, just a number 108. Thank you 108. Jeff - how about listing employee names on receipts? People aren’t numbers.< /review>< Pics>

<text>The store is pretty good and stuff but it depends on the day you come. Sometimes I find stuff that I want or didn’t know I needed but on other days most of the stuff is things that I couldn’t care less about. My favorite part is the alexas and I like talking with them and stuff. (PS I already have an Amazon fire tablet with Alexa on it so I don’t need another one)</text>< pictures>

They need to work out a lot of kinks. I waited in line to return an online item, then was given a coupon. But told that I had to start at the back of the large line to enter the store... I was motivated to buy, but this was a waste of time. They lost a sale and I won’t be returning there again.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>The customer service was excellent. It was well stocked. My favorite department was the kids section. They had a good book selection. It was crowded on Sunday afternoon but the line moved quickly. It was a little difficult to move thru the store with my stroller because the setups and aisles were really  close together. They do not validate parking. Other than that I had a pleasant experience shopping there.<//review>< pictures>

I bought a few things and when I went to pay, I found out as a Prime member I got about $12 more off the price! I had to use my card that’s linked to my Amazon account which was fine. I would have preferred to use my debit card but whatever, not a huge deal.

The glass store front faces the sun so it gets very warm in there. I didn’t see anyone working there asking anyone if they needed help finding things which is why it’s not a 5 star review for this Amazon 4 star.</Review><gmapID>0x80c2c1b68d36d4b1:0x5211787674f3d6c1<//gmapID><Rate>4<//Rate>< name>

Very disappointed with the experience I had on a return at this Amazon 4 star location, definitely  not return friendly experience considering it’s Amazon and I’ve never had any bad experience with them always 4+ star experience with them. I tried doing an exchange on a gift I received for Christmas, the guy assisting me Josue could have just made it clear that I needed the physical card with me instead of having me waste my time trying to get the card number the person used over the phone. All I wanted to do was an exchange and I understand that every retailer has its policies but am already showing you the card number that was used and am trying to do an exchange which I was gonna end up paying more out of pocket than what the gift originally cost. This is Amazon not sure why they couldn’t just take care of the customer. Very disappointing!!!<//review>

<Time>1576652344532< /Time><rating>3</rating><text>I was rang up for the incorrect price for a couple items. When I addressed the issue (after the transaction was complete), I was told that it would take 1-2 hours before a refund could be processed. It took 15 or so minutes to get the difference in cost back because they said that the system wouldn't allow a return on an item that was just purchased. It was a little ridiculous that there isn't a system in place to account for a error that was not my fault. The sales associates were initially unhelpful, but ultimately friendly and helped me to get the price adjustment. I feel like there should be a way for the manager to issue a gift card with the price difference on the spot so that I didn't have to wait.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>This is the most oxymoronic concept. Amazon's whole schtick was it did not have brick and mortar stores, and after going to one you will realize that was to their benefit.  It's like being in a secondhand shop: a whole lot of junk and way too much of what everyone already has because they only sell things that are popular here. Meaning, Amazon's brilliant approach to a store where you can touch things is to sell those products that people already buy or might own. 4 stars solely for the name. For the quality it should be one star.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

As the name, 4 stars. Honestly, I purchased nothing because it didn't have anything exciting and it had mostly Amazon products.<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Good local concept. Certain successful sales products are sold on the web. You can find electronics, books, speakers, toys, kitchen stuff, suitcase appliances, stuffed animals. In short, a great variety of things. There is no way to pay in cash only by credit card.

(Original)
Buen concepto de local. Se venden ciertos productos de ventas exitosas en la web. Se puede encontrar electronica, libros, parlantes, juguetes, cosas de cocina, electrodomésticos maletas, peluches. En fin una gran variedad de cosas. No hay como pagar en efectivo solo con tarjeta de crédito.<//text>< user_id>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) There's nothing there . only children's play products and books and the occasional front door camera. They do not have anything related to motorcycles, lights, patio, decoration or varied electronics. that place is rather just to return an online order

(Original)
Allí no hay nada . sólo productos para jugar de niños y libros y una que otra cámara de puerta de entrada . no cuentan con nada relacionado con motos luces ni patio ni decoracion ni electrónica variada . ese lugar más bien es sólo para devolver algun pedido en línea< /Review>

<Text>I've visited twice to take the notary public exam, so I can only comment on that. It was run by some very fine and friendly seniors and was well organized. Everything planned, laid out, and communicated accordingly. Everyone was very nice and when I needed a pencil sharpened someone in the bar showed me to their office to sharpen it. Very kind.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I like coming to play bingo here. The volunteers are friendly and they have a nice spot to grab something to eat while you're playing. If it couldn't get any better..... they have a bar onsite to get a drink with pool table and jukebox! All in one!!!</Text>< Gmap_id>

The best place for camaraderie, friendship, networking and staying in touch. It's a relaxing atmosphere with a touch of music. Play a game of pool, or soft tip darts. Saturday nights there is karaoke.</Review>

Pretty good food for what it is. Quality here is better than other pizza huts for sure. Pretty fast workers too, one especially (curly hair) is very nice. Came late to get my pizza and he heated it right up for me. 10/10 Pizza Hut</Review>

<text>Pizza and pasta was good but the breadsticks were pretty nasty and tasted way too thick and doughy. Usually Pizza Hut gets these breadsticks on point and looks just like it does on the website if not a little bit crispier. Maybe they changed the recipe or something but it looks like they just used leftover pizza dough and sprinkled garlic and Parmesan on it. Then they skimp out on marinara sauce and only fill the container like 1/4 of the way when they used to fill it up like 7/8 or all the way. Really disappointed.. Pizza was good as always, at least better than Dominos and pasta was decent. Lately though it seems like they’ve been going downhill with cutting corners here and there and it feels like maybe I gotta get used to a new pizza spot.< /text>< Name>

Ordered at 720, delivery said 20-30 mins. The tracker never changed from your order is being made. We had an issue before regarding missing items, but wanted to give them another shot. Tried calling the restaurant and the phone number is no longer valid.<//review>

<Review>The order I received yesterday was not very good. The onions were mainly on one side of the pizza, same with the pineapples only on a few slices of the pizza. I also requested but seasoning on my crust and did not get that. There was barely enough sauce for the wings. The quality of the pizza is not consistent which is very unfortunate because we order from our location pretty often.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp><user_name>Stephanie Yang</user_name><user>110275502490931338822< /user>< gmapID>

I decided to try the Detroit Style Pizza on this visit and it was an unedible mess.  Not sure if it was the fault of the restaurant or just the recipe for this style of pizza but much of the cheese, some of the dough, and some topping just came out barely warmed and not cooked.< /text>

I ordered a pizza yesterday, and I felt that my pizza was undercooked. It tasted doughy and the cheese was not melted properly. My crust still had raw dough.< /Text>

HORRIBLE. I cant believe people choose this place over any other! I asked for double everything extra everything and it's like I asked them to give me less of everything and over charge me! How is it possible that I have a slice with only one mushroom and one pineapple when I asked for so much more than that. Some spots are missing cheese and it doesn't even have a good amount of cheese either. DOMINOS has NEVER been this shameful. I would give a 0 stars and upload pictures of my order but I'm just never NEVER going back NOT EVEN IF ITS 50% OFF. Your better off buying hot pockets</Review>

I downloaded the app, made my order through the the app, picked up my pizza at the time posted. Pizza tasted good. Easy peasy. Minus 1 star for service fee and no free condiments.

I order pizza from Papa John's through the app also, but there are no service fee and condiments are free.<//review>

Always fresh and delicious. We pick up our orders and they're always on time. Prices are fair. Staff is indifferent for the most part but we don't have much interaction with them anyway. Parking is kind of awful, small cramped lot that doesn't work well for trucks. Overall a great place for pizza.<//Text>

This place charges service charge approx. 5% of the cost of pizza. They say cost of doing business to California.  They also gave me the wrong order.  Ordered Veggie and was given Meat lover.< /review>

He took a bite straight away and devoured it. I told him this was combo not pepperoni pineapple. Now we couldn't return it. Plus, when I came. I saw no one at the counter. I had to call him twice and answered. He came did the usual and stayed quiet. I took the pizza and quickly walked back to the kitchen. Disappointed in PizzaHut. Im switching to Dominos which is farther, but hey why not?<//text>< pics>

Just received a pie from here, I literally pulled over to throw up a slice because it tasted like it contain house hold cleaning products. Continued mission and tasted another slice of similar taste which has me believe it was intentional in the first place< /review>

<review>Always messing up orders. This is the second time that they gave us the wrong order. Horrible customer service and the manager there named Teresa said that it was our fault plus to add onto this horrible experience, the pizza was 20 minutes late. Think twice before you come to this place.<//review>< Pics>

Others in the area did not even return a phone call, the places were dirty and not even paved or the prices were crazy. Nice paved, clean facility with easy in and out access to inside units. Easy to get a moving van in and out! Great location too. Secure!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>All I can say is Patty from Missouri Flat Storage in Placerville, CA is an amazing employee. She went above and beyond my standards of customer service. I needed to get into my storage without the key and she went out of her way (the day before Christmas, mind you) to make sure I can get my stuff in the time frame needed. I can honestly say this has been the best and easiest experience I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Missouri Flat storage is a great place to keep your stuff stored! 100% would recommend!< /text></record></dataset><record>

The storage units are fine. However, it has been a real pleasure to work with Kierstin in the office. I believe I also was served very well by another woman but I don’t recall her name.
Your customer service is your strongest point!!!

The only problem I had was not being able to enter the storage space until the manager opened up.  If I would have had direct payment rather than paid by check I could have gotten in earlier.  Should have been told that up front.  Otherwise every thing was great.</review>

Top notch customer service, couldn’t have been happier with the on site staff. I arrived with ten minutes left of the day and (insert name of the awesome lady that helped me better I’m brain dead) although it was the end of her day she proceeded to get me all set up without a grimace our a grow even though she left half hour after her normal time. (INOTALTHM) was quick, thorough and efficient getting me up and running. Facility is nice, clean, well lit, Easy to access.

The reason I gave out four stars instead of five has to do with pricing issues. First, if you want expanded hours to get to your stuff you need to out in to auto-pay. Lame. The lock type that’s mandatory is decent but it kind of seems like it’s also a really great way to add 20 dollars onto the  upfront cost, same with the $25 administration fee. I mean the place is there to rent storage units, it’s not like I showed up and asked them to schedule the oil change, tooth cleaning and chiropractic visit I’ve been needing- that would justify an extra fee in my eyes. None This should reflect on the staff I encountered, I suspect it’s corporate decisions.

TLDR: nice place, great staff, pricy but if your nice maybe you’ll get a little surprise for your first month.<//review>

Had to find storage during a move and called several places in the area. Kirsten's follow up and professionalism gave me the confidence to choose the Depot. She's really friendly and great to work with and really runs a tight ship which is what we wanted since we're storing our household with her. The place is spotless and even our movers made a point of saying it was a great place - and they've seen them all!</text>

I rate this storage facility a 12 out of 10. It is by far the best storage facility around, or that I’ve ever used.  I have rented several units here over the past several years and always have been pleased.  The staff is top notch, they go out of their way to accommodate your needs.  They are friendly and know their business, especially the manager.  She is great.  The facility is always clean and units are in great condition, brightly lit and secure. Its wonderful to know your belongings are safe and secure.   Plus there is a bathroom and running water on site as well as a moving truck for use.  It is worth every penny you spend for a unit here. Thank you to the staff at Missouri Flat Storage!< /Review>

This company was great. I want to say special kudos to Rob for going always the extra mile to answer any questions I had. Very professional and detailed businessman . I would return to do business with him if I were to ever return to California. Keep up the good work guy. I felt my music equipment was very safe and secure while I had it in this very clean facility.
Thankyou and happy trails.

<Review>I have never needed a storage unit before and I did not know what to expect. Having this place available while moving from one place to another sure made for a smoother transition.
The staff was simply amazing. I interacted with both Kirsten and Rob on different occasions. Both were friendly, nice and very helpful.
I was very pleased to see how clean everything was. Relieved at the number of cameras they had too. Security seemed not to be an issue.
Access was simple with our own unique gate code.
Use of a moving truck for a day...for FREE... blew me away.
I only needed the huge 10x30 unit short term. Closing out the unit was easy and painless.
I highly recommend Missouri Flat Storage. There was nothing I would have changed. The unit and the staff exceeded my expectations by far.

<user>100090285827563147855</user><Text>What a terrific experience - from the first call with many questions, to our arriving this past weekend, after a multi-state move, with most of our belongings, which fit very neatly into the very clean storage unit.  Totally impressed all the way, answered all of our questions, gave us some great local information, even helped with finding a place to store our truck overnight (too big to get into our son's driveway!).  We were able to borrow their small truck to transport part of our belongings to our son's home, and Ralph even provided some minor first aid when my husband cut his hand while moving things.  If you want a GREAT experience with storing your things, we HIGHLY recommend Missouri Flat Storage Depot -- really great people, clean & well-kept storage facility and awesome customer service.

Chawn had originally been who spoke with my boyfriend, and he also attempted to help me. He wasn't very personable, and forgot my name even though he had my DL right in front of him. Every time I asked a question, he would say, "Uh, probably." Which made me very uneasy. I almost walked out when Kirsten came in- she was SO friendly, communicative, and was able to answer all my questions. She took the lead, and saw how frustrated I was. She apologized, showed me around, and made me change my mind about leaving. (It's hard to change my mind- she has done if the best customer service out there!) I highly suggest talking to her, and coming here for storage needs. The facility is one of the cleanest I've seen, and very obviously well maintained and secure.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1563556299544, 'text': "Hello, we're happy you found our staff to be so supportive during your experience here at Missouri Flat Storage Depot-Placerville.

<Review>As storage companies go I was pleased doing business with Missouri Flat Storage Depot. I found the facility on Missouri Flat to be very clean, safe and secure. The staff taking care of the storage depot are very friendly and very helpful. What I liked the most were the reminders through a courtesy call and emails that another rent payment was due so I never missed a payment. I would suggest them to anybody that needed storage, you won't go wrong renting storage through Missouri Flat Storage Depot.</Review>< Name>

<Review>Clean and convenient.  Great location and the unit I received was  clean and in great shape. Helpful and professional employee. A bit more expensive than other places I looked at , but this place is under surveillance,  very secure and close to my home so it is well worth it.< /Review>< pics>

The lady there Kristen I believe is her name has been awesome she was able to show me the actual sizes of the storage units I was interested in and even able to hold one for me until I know for sure. The place is always clean, I feel it is well protected and they always answer my questions along with taking my payment over the phone. I feel my stuff is in good hands and their prices are quite comparable. and I would recommend them to others!< /review>

All storage facilities should be like this! Chawn, the young man in training (you'd never know) that took care of setting up our lease, was very helpful and kind. A gentleman-give that guy a raise as soon as possible! And Robert closef the deal. Professional, his explanations were very clear and concise. And even had a sense of (appropriate) humor, sorely lacking nowadays, but appeciated by this Camp Fire survivor and evacuee from Paradise,  CA. Thanks guys!<//Text>

Wish I could give them 6 stars and beyond. Wasn't really thinking that a Storage facility could have friendly staff, a spotless facility with free water and candy during business hours. They were patrolling the property and came back with cold water and always have free pallets to use and a state of the art facility.  Next time I'm in the need for a unit. I'll look no further as they take care of you here. I was only there for a few months and trusted our stuff there the whole time.  Glad to do business with them.< /Review>

When I move my business from Southern California to Northern California in Placerville I couldn’t find a storage unit open on Sunday or Monday except for Missouri flat storage I was very surprised on how clean and nice the people were to me & the rates are very reasonable. I would highly recommend this storage facility to anyone looking for a great storage facility & a lot of security.  Thanks again Missouri flat storage< /text>

<Text>Happy to recommend this storage facility.  Staff member Ralph was an immense help, clearly explaining everything to me, on what was an emotional and tense moving day.  But he relieved me of any stress I might have felt in this process and walked me thru all the policies and protocols, checking out the space before I signed the final agreement, going above and beyond in all details.  Stephen was there too, and he was friendly and helpful also.  Great staff, clean facility, easy process.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

This storage facility is no facility, its more like storing things at your parents house. They are always welcoming and willing to help in any way possible. They always have ice cold bottled water and candy for their customers (my son always take the orange jolly ranchers). If I ever needed to store things again it would be with them! Thank you!</Text>

<text>Seriously, I'm so happy right now! We've rented a unit here last year and it was awesome! I came in yesterday looking for packing peanuts for a very delicate and large package I was going to ship.  I had already been to UPS and the USPS for quotes so getting it prepared for the long cross country trek was my goal. RalphTheirs not only greeted me at the door, but carried the package in for me. It was 25 pounds and awkward to carry so that meant a lot.  Kirsten Prince showed me all the different packing products that might help, and even helped me reorganize the box! I was shipping a spinning wheel that was partially assembled... with very delicate moving parts.  Kirsten and Ralph made sure that every piece was protected and safe, even reinforcing the box with extra tape and Fragile tape to insure it was handled carefully on it's journey.  The best part is that they inquired about my shipping quotes, which were $90 UPS, and $75 USPS. They mentioned that they shipped UPS, and would like to see if they could beat my quotes. I laughed thinking that I already had a UPS quote, what was the point? They measured and weighed the box, added the appropriate insurance on it, and beat not only my UPS quote, but also the USPS one too! $63 bucks!!!!!! That was a huge drop, and I was extremely thankful for it! It's customer service like this that I wish was everywhere. The sad thing is that it's really rare to be treated like a valued customer with important business. The UPS store and my local USPS didn't give me confidence that my package was important and delicate, or that it would arrive in one piece. Missouri Flat Storage did.  Ralph must have put a pound of tape on the outside of the box (which was already used once and had some dings in it) to reinforce cardboard and it's rigidity.  Neither of them tried to up sell me on packing products... even went looking for some that might have been left over from others! I swear I will never taking my moving, storing, and now shipping business anywhere else.

We are second time storage users with Missouri Flat Storage Depot and we have been treated like family each time. They are clean units with outside cleanliness as well. We are impressed with the staff and storage or we wouldn't have come back!</text>

<text>Great business!  Facility is great but Kirsten & Ralph keep everything "ship-shape" in the most pleasant way.  Always professional, helpful; care about you, your family, and your experience. Supplies/boxes I've needed always available, they bring right to my unit if I can't carry them. Love the fact that they are constantly checking the entire area--I'm always by myself and they bring water, check to see if I'm safe, important to a grandmother. They've been excellent problem solvers with my 2 units, having to switch back and forth in a short time, preparing for move out of state in a month, and having the box truck available was wonderful, also.  I'm especially impressed that the bathroom is so clean, always!

Kirsten is the best. I had a tight situation where I had to move my things before I'd found a new place to live, and she was a great help. She even gave me a discount off the first month. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a storage place.<//review>

I rented a 10x25 unit on Saturday and when the movers got there at 5:30 we realized the unit was too small.  I saw that Ralph was still in the office so I went to see him.   He had shut down his system but when I told him That I needed a bigger unit he came out of the office to show me a 12 by 30 unit. The Mover told me yes that will work. So Ralph went ahead and opened up his computer and gave me a new contract for the new unit.  Such great service!   Thank you!< /review>

Excellent facility with kind, courteous and caring staff.

Pricing is a bit high; but you know that old saying....’you get what you pay for’!!!  That applies here.

Kirsten & Robert have gone out of their way make our move in / out seemless.

This is our 4th unit in three years at MSFS. Thank you again Kirsten & Robert!!!  You make this place what it is!!!!

IT WAS 104 DEGREES OUTSIDE AND WORSE ON THE BLACKTOP,AND THEY GAVE US ALL WAETER SEVERAL TIMES. THEY HAD RECOMENDED THE EXACT SIZE UNIT BASED ONLY ON MY DESCRIBING WHAT WOULD GO IN.  0N MY SECOND RUN I DIDN'T MAKE ATURN INTO A PARKING LOT WIDE ENOUGH, HIT THE EDGE OF A CARPORT AND PUT A HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THIER TRUCK. THEY DIDN'T FREAK OR GET MAD, JUST SAID STUFF HAPPENS AND THAT'S WHAT INSURANCE IS FOR!! THEY ALL HAVE BEEN VERY POLITE AND THIER RECOMENDATIONS RIGHT.</review>

We are fortunate having B &B so close to our home. Our golf group enjoys seating outside during the pandemic where we can enjoy a variety of breakfast choices. My favorites are the Sunrise sandwich or lox and cream cheese with an onion on a sesame seed bagel.< /review>

While they may not have gluten free bagels, they DO have gluten free toast and made my omelet to order (they normally use butter so they made mine with oil due to my milk allergy and omitted the cheese).

Hot and delicious and at amazing prices with super helpful staff! And despite the crowd, didn't have to wait long for my food.<//text>

I met a friend at B & B this morning.  My sunrise sandwich was delicious, but what happened afterwards is what really impressed me and I am so grateful for.  When I got to my car, I realized that I didn't have my keys.  I searched my car, the area where we sat, inquired inside if keys had been turned in.  I gave up looking, and on my way home ( my husband brought me a key)remembered taking the keys out of my purse.  I then thought that maybe I had accidentally thrown them away.with my trash.My husband and I. returned and the manager/ owner? went to the dumpsters out back and SHE and we looked through 6 trash bags and FOUND the keys!!  She was so very nice and helpful and we
so appreciated it!!</text>

Went into B&B for the first time, as they don't have these back home in Idaho. The staff was very nice and friendly. I ordered the Hot Sicilian on toasted Sourdough, and I must say, the sandwich was very delicious and I ate every bite!  If I see this restaurant on my travels again, I will definitely stop and try another sandwich. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick lunch!< /Text>

< Review>
I have been a regular customer of Bagels & Brew for many years.  I was saddened by the closure of the Aliso Viejo location.  The closure led me to the next closest location in Mission Viejo.  I was served by the rudest person today.  I ordered a dozen bagels and proceeded to the cold case to get a specialty cream cheese.  I selected a container in the second row and the disrespectful employee told me I was required to take a container from the front.  The employee told me the owner requires customers to select front containers, otherwise they would never be sold.  I told the employee his attitude and behavior was poor customer service and as expected, he didn't care.  I put the cream cheese back and realized the customer service at this location is not worthy of my purchases.  I have been in customer service my entire professional career and if I was his boss, he would be a former employee.  During difficult times from the current pandemic, customer service is an absolute must if you want to keep your doors open.  The owner should be ashamed to have such a person at the front counter.  Hmmm....maybe the Mission Viejo location will be the next Bagels & Brew location to close due to terrible customer service.  I won't go back and look forward to giving my daily business to BAGEL ME!, BRUEGGER'S BAGELS, and I LOVE BAGELS.</Review>

<Text>Ordered the French dip sandwich described as "piled high with meat and grilled mushroom and onions". I opted for no mushrooms, and was given three slices of meat folded over with a slice of cheese and raw Bermuda onions. Not what I was expecting. Certainly not "piled high" with meat. Busy place. Clean, with courteous service. Tasted ok, just didn't fit the description of the item.< /Text>< pics>

I was extremely disappointed at the quality of service and how our food was made.  If we weren't visiting with family,  we would have left.   We ordered a omelet  and a Nova salmon sandwich.   The cooked omelet came in 5 minutes but the lox sandwich came after 40 minutes and was not complete as ordered.  We asked for it to be scooped and toasted.  This was not done. Just really disappointed and probably will find another place to go and enjoy w/ family.</text>

< Review>
The food here is good and it's nice to eat at a family owned restaurant. Location is nice, small and casual. Nice drink and food selection. Great sides as well as quality bagels and other breads. It is great that they employ teenagers as well. The only downfall is I have been here when it wasn't busy and the workers gossip loudly even when serving customers. My mom and I shared a plate which included an omelette and a bagel, we asked for the bagel on a different plate so that it didn't get soggy from being in contact with the hot omelette. They did not listen and out came a soggy bagel on top of our omelette. My mom had also asked for the omelette to be cooked "easy" so that there was no brown visible though it came well done covered in brown spots. They also throw cheese slices onto their omelettes at the last minute so it is never truly melted but instead almost still cold. I really like supporting family owned businesses but this was a bummer.<//Review>

I've been a frequent visitor of Bagels & Brew since they opened and I keep coming back every chance I can. Though everything I've ordered at B&B has been exceptional, I am especially fond of their honey chicken sandwich on squaw bread. Delectable! The atmosphere is surprisingly quaint for a strip center local, the energy is always up, the parking ample, the staff is friendly, service is fast, prices are right on, and they provide outdoor seating as well. I think I am going to go tomorrow!<//text>

<text>It was sooo busy when we went, which is to be expected on a Sunday morning.  The couple of things that made our experience less than 5 star were...The cashier called the next person in line which was my sister-in-law, she turned to ask a clarifying question to our group, when she turned back to the cashier he said "I am sorry ma'am I cant help you now." He apparently needed to help someone on the phone.  Probably not the best way to handle that situation.  Lastly, there were 3 orders in our group and they were all placed back to back.  The first 2 orders came out and were completely eaten before the last order came out.  At one point I went back in and ask the last person in our group if they had taken up residency in restaurant... that's how long it took for the last order.  Coffee was good, food was ok.< /text>< user_id>

<Text>Sooooo much more than a bagel place! I first took my daughter there a couple of months ago for a simple bagel and cream cheese after school. I wasn't expecting to get anything myself because I cannot eat bagels. We walked in and.... whoa! They have a full breakfast and lunch menu, including totally non-bagel-related foods! Fantastic quality and service, check this place out. You will not be disappointed!</Text>< UserId.>

I have been coming here for 10+ years. I've since moved away but still make time to always have breakfast here. Bagels are awesome (you cant go wrong with anything on the menu) and service is great. Highly recommended.</Text>

Specifically, i used to order the Flat Iron Steak sandwich religiously, on a weekly basis, and they have stopped offering this menu item, and apparently do not offer steak on the menu altogether.

They used to send out coupons regularly as well, but it looks like they haven't done that in awhile...</text>< Pics>

Very nice combo of family owned but clearly a professional operation. These guys can handle big crowds so don’t walk away from a big line. Love their breakfast plates...Baja scramble & downtown scramble are both delish. Try PESTO FLORENTINE SUNRISE sandwich spinach, tomato,  scrambled eggs, jack cheese, mushrooms & pesto aioli. Great lunch sandwiches too!< /Text>

<text>Gave me the wrong order, took a short while, to find the correct order.
No apology of any kind!

I ordered 2 omelettes.
1) tomato, spinach, green peppers.
2) spinach, mushrooms, and bacon.
The order was repeated twice and confirmed twice.

What we got.
1) Tomato, spinach, green peppers, mushroom.
2) Spinach,  mushrooms, bacon and green peppers.
The final insult was the spinach.
" Canned spinach"  Really???

Never again.</text>< Time>

I've come here quite a few times and that's why I'm giving it a 3. But during this occasion they messed up two out of two of my orders. The service is friendly but at times not accurate. The food is pretty standard, good at most.</review>

<review>Decent coffee and an array of bagel choices. Must of their food is very much based on cheese, egg and bagel. Just okay, nothing noteworthy. Service is lackluster. Usually crowded.<//review>< Time>

Really crowded even on a Thursday morning, staff was very friendly and quick to serve but the quality is just not where it should be. Asked for toasted and it just tasted stale.<//Text>

One of my favorite places to dine! The authentic Colombian cuisine reminds me of my own abuelita's cooking. The food is fresh and always tasty. Service can be a little slow when it's busy, but they are always kind and helpful. The food in itself earns this place 5 stars for me. Would recommend time and time again.<//review>

Came here on a Friday night with my guy and we we're seated right away.  Quiet little spot tucked away in a shopping center. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive. The sangria messed me up-very tasty and the food was FANTASTIC. 100% authentic Columbian fare-best I've had since leaving my hometown in NYC.  If I could just find a good slice of pizza around here I'd be all set.< /text>

The food here is delicious and the atmosphere is fun. It can get a little loud with the live music and service can be slow, especially if you come with a big group. The food is worth the wait though!<//Text>

I know NOTHING about Columbian food. I was forced to go here by my wife and two other couples. I don't know what I ate but it was great! The service was top notch. The coffee was superb. I will definitely eat here again. That's saying a lot because I am VERY picky.</Text>

<Review>FOODV It's absolutely DELICIOUS, but a bit XPENSIVE. It could or should be less xpensive for the amount of food you get, even though it's delicious and very typically oriented. Right on. People are very nice and friendly. LIVE Music is FANTASTIC!!!...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT😄<//Review>< date>

<text>Authentic Colombian food. Plates are really big and delicious and it's a very good value. Service is good as well. Bandeja paisa is a must but they also serve a wide variety of their local comfort food, typical dishes as well as arepas. The vibe is a normal casual restaurant. They sometimes have live music on weekends!
Definitely worth trying!<//text>< name>

He treats you like family. The food was delicious, we had empanadas, caldo de marina (fish stew) ... arroz con pollo ... it was all very good and served in a timely fashion.< /review>< user_name>

<name>EDGAR DIAZ</name><text>Great Colombian food, some of rhe best I have tasted in the US.  "Arepas de chocolo" and the "cazuela" were great choices.  Dessert was very difficult to pick (to many great options) but both the "postre de natas" and "brevas con arequipe" let us thinking in the next time we will come back.</text><Date>1455770559412< /Date></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I love this place, it is far from home but I stick the trip to be able to enjoy good Colombian food with good seasoning. My favorite is the seafood casserole, the fried mojarra, the rice with chicken, in short everything I have tried is delicious!

(Original)
Me encanta este lugar, me queda lejisimos de casa pero me pego el viaje para poder disfrutar de buena comida Colombiana con buen sazón. Mi favorito la cazuela de mariscos, la mojarra frita, el arroz con pollo, en fin todo lo que he probado es delicioso!< /text>

< review>
This is a very good fast casual Mexican place for breakfast lunch dinner in Mountain View.  The Mountain View special burrito is my favorite its tasty fresh juicy rich and decent price. They have good tacos and a breakfast menu. Plus good Mexican refreshment drinks like Horchata and Rose drink. You will pay few bucks more on average than Taco Bell but you will get consistently better Mexican food. In the COVID time they are operating solid take out service with quick order completion. It's been a Best of Mountain View award winner for many years! Its kind of a hidden gem in a small strip mall.< /review>

The fastest burrito place ever. Faster then McDonald’s and Taco Bell combined. I turned around and my burrito was ready. Less than 60 seconds</Review>

We went here to celebrate an occasion, and were in the mood for Mexican. The food was quite average, especially for the prices charged. Everything was ok. Service was good, drinks were good. For reference we had the tacos, the jalapeno potatoes (very bland, no kick) and the seafood crepe(?) dish (it was ok).< /text>

<review>Had a burrito for lunch receny at this place and enjoyed it. The flavors were great, enjoyed the quality and freshness of everything, especially the salsas. The carne asada could have been a bit more tender, unfortunately it was a bit chewy. Good prices, fast and friendly service.</review>< username>

My favorite place for burritos. The atmosphere in the store isn't much, but the burritos are the best around, and at a good price. They are certainly better than any of the big chains. Part of what makes them so good, is the choice of size (chico, regular, and super), beans (refried, pinto, and black), rice (spanish, brown, and white),  and salsa (mild, medium, and hot).< /text>

I have looked far and wide for the best burrito in my area and I found it- in my own backyard of all places.  My favorite burrito here is the Carnitas Chiconcoac.  There is a special flavor to this carnitas meat that hits the spot for me.  I went 2 days in a row ordering this.  I just missed the cutoff for ordering tonight so I'll grab another one tomorrow.<//review>

The burrito range goes from regular to huge and everything in between. They will customize your order and offer daily specials. This is my go to burrito place. Lots of choices and has been at the same location for years. They have lots of dishes on the menu but I'm hooked on their fresh, juicy and delicious burritos< /review>

In short, extremely good authentic mex for the price.  Used to be even cheaper before the pandemic, but it's still a far better value than garbage like Chipotle.<//Review>

<Text>The best burritos in the South Bay. Huge variety of traditional meats, salsas, and sauces. You can go mild or spicy and the burrito flavors still shine through. It may look small on the outside but this is a local hot spot and very popular with many folks in the area. Definitely worth a stop if you love a great burrito!< /Text></record>

I'm lucky to have moved in right around the corner from the area's best burrito place! I recommend the Pollo en mole. They stew it fresh every day. One day I arrived right when they opened, and they had to ask back to the guy stirring this huge pot if it was ready yet. You may have to wait until it's properly lunch time for this treat!

La Costeña has been a great resource when we invite a number of friends over for a game day. We can all walk down there and everyone can have a nice custom made meal.

A lot of people get takeout here, and they keep the line moving quickly. If you want to sit (indoors, outdoors, or at their large community table), there is always plenty of room.

They are generous with their portions. They are precise with making everything as ordered.

They have vegetarian and vegan options. Ask them to customize any way you need. Since they make everything fresh they are knowledgeable about all the ingredients. It may not be a good pick, though, for those with highly sensitive allergies, as they can't guarantee there won't be cross-contamination from the assembly-line style of preparation.< /Text>

<username>Rita Morgin<//username><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Review>It is okay. Their food is very mild and they have no signs of Salsas or condiments. To me the sign of a great Mexican Taqueria is a kind of like a condiment and salsa bar that you can put the proper amount of heat on. This one doesn't have that. The food is very simple and Mild. It is still good. But you really have to ask for the hot stuff because they do not put it on and they do not even ask you how hot you want it< /Review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Over the years, my daughter and I have taken out many a burrito from La Costena.  They are so delicious!  No wonder this plain-looking place win "Best of Mountain View" year after year.  Wait is usually short, although we do not really go there at peak hour.  Dining area is limited, and furniture is very minimal.  But I give five stars for the price/cost ratio: they are also very inexpensive.</Review>

I have been going to La Costeña for years. When it was in the back of a Mexican market.  The burritos are excellent.  I highly recommend the mole.  It is not a typical, heavy chocolate mole.  It is more o a lighter brown color.  The taste is phenomenal. Their carne azada is on point too!  Their nachos, tacos and quesadillas are also great!  Staff is very friendly too.  I highly recommend this place!< /Review>

The food here was not bad but a bit on the mild side. I did not try the meat options (pescatarian) but the vegetable options left me quite disappointed.</Text>

The last time I've been here was when I was living in Mountain View. The service was good, and the food was, okay, a bit more salty than  usual.. But still good.. I think next time I'll just get a burrito instead of a plate. Overall, I give this a four star because of the food being a bit salty. Service was satisfactory.< /review>

<text>Very accessible place for burritos, also close to Sunnyvale if you are working there. Unfortunately I did not take any pictures. Useful if you want a tasty burrito to go. You can certainly sit down and there is space yet it is not formal at all so be aware of that. Score is mostly for the surroundings, food is good.</text>< Pictures>

<review>This place is just a pale facsimile of it's former self when it was located on Middlefield Rd. I ordered the vegetarian burrito and the wife had chicken enchiladas. Both were pricey compared to other places we've been to and the guy behind the counter seemed completely indifferent to helping us. It took @ 10 minutes for the food to arrive and it was look warm. Had the food warmed, but it was fairly mediocre at best. Don't know why these guy's keep winning these best of Mountain View awards. There's nothing anymore about them that they deserve to win, and there's much better places locally.< /review>< Pictures>

Good variety of chicken options, but overly dry tacos and meh quesadilla 😒 It didn't help that there was no salsa provided, despite assurances that it was included in the plates.</text>

I don't eat Mexican often but I've been here twice and had an excellent burrito each time:  first was chicken and the second was carne asada.  Quick service.  Can see how some people can think it is less than friendly but I thought the service was quick and efficient. Just don't expect conversation they are trying to get good food out quickly... good enough for me.  👍</review>

Super quick! Very carb-tastic! Wonderful chicken. I got my food in about 2 minutes and had more than I could eat at once from the "super burrito." Calories per dollar? Optimized. If you want beans, rice, and tortillas :)<//text>

This was the first e-commerce site, when Sun engineers set up a fax+ xwindows tool(xburrito) to order from your desktop in the early 1980s. It was a grocery store then where you could order your custom burrito by pointing to what you wanted. Then Run by an old husband and wife team. Now the store has moved to a new location, and the ordering process has changed. The burrito is still good, but you can no longer ask for exactly what you want. The large one can still feed a family of four. Still one of the better burrito in town< /Text>

Favorite taqueria in Mountain View. It's still not as good as the old location was (and I really miss the Subway-style ordering process, as they do mess up orders regularly), but the Pollo en molo with fire salsa is still my favorite burrito.< /review>

<review>Great handmade burritos made to order. It felt more customizable when they were at the old location but the place is still good. Same cashier guy as the old place so this appears to be a family business.  They have daily specials which is 4.99 for a regular burrito (any meat) which includes a can soda.  People mostly go for the mt.view special ( your choice of meat) burrito and it is always made well and fast. This is my go to place for burritos in the area.<//review>< username>

The best burritos in Mountain View. They have a big menu — eight or nine different kinds of meat, plus lots of other fillings. It's no longer a burrito bar, where you walk down the line and pick out the ingredients you want — you have to pick them all from the menu. But it still tastes just as good.<//Review>

i find it quite telling that every bad review I've seen for them is full of poor grammar and atrocious spelling. this place is still as great as it was when it was back on old middlefield. i'm only sad that people can't have the same pick what you want as you walk along the ingredients experience. you can get their burritos however you want them, so if you don't like them, it's definitely on you! just wish it was in a more convenient location so i don't keep forgetting it's there!< /Review>

Loved this place. I got the chicken mole 🌮 and the carne asada 🌮 and it was delicious. Their guac and salsa were SO great too. The rest of my party each got different things like the veggie 🌮 and the super burrito and everything was really good. I can't wait to go back there!</text>

Many options of meat, salsa, beans to choose from.

You can choose between three different sizes, which is great because some other stores *coughChipotlecough* have such big burritos you feel kind of sick after eating it.</text>< Pics>

one of the best burritos in the South Bay. it's tied with another taqueria for my #1 spot. highly recommended.

just be aware of what you're ordering. I think their "super" burrito relates to the size of the burrito rather than the ingredients.<//text>

Fantastic authentic Mexican in fast food style. So much better than any chain in the area. Gets super crowded for lunch on weekdays, but dinner/weekends is much less packed. Recommend garlic beef (de ajo)!< /review>

<Review>This has been one of my favorite burrito places since I moved to the Bay area and loves in mountain view. I used to go to it's old location on rengsdorf I believe but stopped after moving to San Francisco. I was really happy to learn that they moved to the same shopping center as my dentist who I continue to go to for toothwork. It's great, I get do enjoy a burrito with a numb mouth every once in a while.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808fb73df5dbdad3:0x977decc5fec0afad<//gmap_id></record>

Still one of the best burrito places in the South Bay. They have a great selection of meat fillings and all the toppings that you might want. For breakfast, I heartily recommend the chorizo and egg breakfast burrito.< /Review>

One of the best burrito places I have been to. They use high quality ingredients and have a variety of choices for what to put in the burritos. However, I enjoyed the restaurant more when it was chipotle style you choose as you go.< /text>

<GmapID>0x808fb73df5dbdad3:0x977decc5fec0afad</GmapID><Text>After all these years and a location change, La Costena still boasts the best burrito in the South Bay and one of the best in the Bay Area. When it comes to burritos, the attention to detail, the quality of each ingredient, and importantly, the balance between ingredients, are second to none. La Costena offers an exquisite variety of tasty meat options and plenty of fresh ingredients. Don't be afraid to customize your burrito and order exactly what you want! My go-to is a regular carne asada burrito with refried beans, Spanish rice, "both kinds of cheeses," sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, and hot salsa roja. Yum! Diced jalapeños or their "hot pico" option are fine additions if you want something spicy! Note that "regular" and "super" refer to the size of the burrito, not the ingredients.< /Text></record>

this is probably the best burritos outside of nacho mamas in garberville. the burrito bar has about 40 topics to pick from. this burrito place got into the guiness book for largest burrito. i don't think the other google reviewers shared this useful information in their scope. do they? i like this burrito place a lot<//review>

It's a nice hole in the wall. Menu on the chalkboard, burritos in chico (big), regular (huge), and super (could feed two, possibly three), everything fresh, with good seating. Parking is ample, service is fast.< /review>

Had their tiny burito for $4. Delicious and just the perfect size for a 5' 2" woman like me. I hate wasting food and money, so this place is perfect for a filling dinner.< /review>

La Costena is a small place dedicated to burritos. They have a large selection of proteins and other ingredients like veggies and cheeses. You choose all your ingredients as you go and watch them make it right in front of you.

They offer different sizes of burritos. Be careful when ordering the super burrito. It is actually a gigantic burrito made from two tortillas. They also offer a special every that includes a free canned drink.

They do have seating outside, which isn't bad on most evenings in Mountain View.<//text>< userid>

I loved this place, in their old location. It seems as through they refuse to listen to order preferences at their new location...I only ask that they cut up the steak well and pit lots of rice. I'll pay for extra rice or I'll cut the steak more but alas I go elsewhere now, sadly.</Text>

The best burrito in Silicon Valley!  It used to be a custom burrito counter in the back of a market,  but now they have moved to a new location and are a full restaurant.

Everything is good,  but I especially like the Pollo Baracho burrito "Mountain View Special".<//Text>

<Text>Delicious burritos at this authentic taqueria in Mountain View. Lots of variety, so you can design your own perfect burrito.

< Review>
SUPER BURRITO????? I have been to many different places where they have a "super burrito" and from what I've notice is that it's called "super" because they add more "prime" ingredients not just for the size. I order a so called " super burrito" and for the $13 I paid I was expecting much more then what I got. And what I got is not even worth $5. My "super burrito" had beans, rice, salsa Verde, and just SOME carne asada, and I said some because it was only like a soup spoon of meat in the middle. Very disappointed. Not worth the money I spent.<//Review>

<Text>I had the Mountain View special with pollo barracho. It was decent. Easily better than Qdoba and chipotle  but overall it left me wanting a good old fashion SF burrito. Unfortunately the trek is still necessary.<//Text>< gmapID>

<Review>[From August 2008]

I ordered an enchilada platter today and was pretty darn pleased.

PORTION: Large, but not humongous.  That's fine :)
BEANS (whole): Cooked nicely, decent scoop, a bit watery, though (lady was too impatient to let it drain).
SALSA (mild): Don't really taste it in the mix.  To their credit, they have a selection of salsas.
GUAC: Really tasty!  Seems decently fresh.
MEAT (chicken mole):  Cooked perfectly (tender, not dry).  Nicely seasoned, but nothing amazing.
ENCHILADA:  Grilled with cheese on it, not microwaved!  This may seem like a no-duh idea, but I've been bummed at how many Mexican places just nuke their enchiladas!
CHIPS:  None offered.  Hey, that sucks :-(
COST:  Not too bad, but charging for everything extra is annoying.
DRINK:  Maybe I missed it, but no horchata and such?  WTH?
SERVICE:  Okay.  Woman wasn't particularly friendly.
PARKING:  Yeah, it generally sucks, but there were two open spaces on this Sunday afternoon.

People rave about La Bamba compared to this?!  You can see my review of that place, but in a nutshell, why?!?  La Bamba offered practically no customization (not even choices of salsa?!?), and their burrito tasted more like a quesadilla to me... way too much cheese.  Yuck.< /Review><Response>None<//Response>< pictures>
