< Review>
I ordered this for my wife and her friends and coworkers loved it!

It’s. It for everyone; but when you’ve given someone just about anything they could want; this stands out as a creative, cost effective alternative to the traditional flower arrangement. I’m not sure why others complained but for me; it’s a great thing from time to time.< /Review>

<Review>Great interior! Perfectly fit for a flower shop place. All of the flowers that I was looking for were all intact to this place. I am deeply impressed by how they handled their flowers correctly with no flaws at all. Everything went very well with this flower shop. Trust me! You will never be disappointed for sure! They deserve great ratings.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>I went to this place to buy some flowers for my mom.  I got fascinated by the flowers that they had. They were all beautiful and stunning.  I feel like I’m in a flower garden when I went there shop. The florist of this shop gave me some idea about what kind of flowers I would give to my mom. I love how she arranged the flowers. It was so beautiful and classy. I will surely visit this shop again.</text>< user_id>

mira and mike made my special same day delivery possible! i am from toronto canada and was able to coordinate an order all the way in california with an anniversary edible arrangement and a small gift. i am very happy and appreciative of their help and urge anyone to call in and keep in touch with the process of their order if they want to make an arrangement.

i will be more than happy to order from them again. mira was very helpful and mike was kind and able to call me and keep in touch for a surprise delivery.

many of the other edible arrangement locations in the area did not offer or provide the same level of customer service so i highly recommend using this location.

great staff!

thanks again< /review>

This has to be the worst location! I ordered some chocolate covered strawberries on V-day. They were never delivered. 2/15 I get a call that the delivery person is there ,(9am)and my fiance and I were both at work. I told the driver to come back anytime after 4pm. Its 6:42, they close at 7. I have been calling this store since Thursday and have yet to speak to anyone. I paid an extra $20 to have it delivered, and it's looking like it won't even arrive until tomorrow (2/16).  it's pretty ridiculous! I'll be charging this back and reporting this location to corporate. I get that it's a franchise but this is just bad business!! They do not answer their phone!!<//Text>

Same nightmare experience as everyone else, my bf placed an order that was never delivered, never received a call, called the next day to only be lied to again saying they were on their way on the 15th as the spoke roughly around 11am never got delivered either. This place is a scam and will better yet report to the BBB as everyone else should be doing.< /Review>

<Review>Not an order for me, but I do work in reception for a company this location was delivering to today.  The recipient was out of the office and the driver told me that I could not refuse delivery if I didn't tell her to come pick it up at the store.  I have never had that told to me before and I have refused deliveries often due to them coming after an employee has left for the day. Not our fault you delivered to someone who is not in the office and he tried to insist on leaving the order until after I called him on the fact that I have refused deliveries on multiple occasions in the past, with no hassle at all.  I understand this is not the closest location to our office, but it's not our fault, nor the recipients fault, that your company accepted an order for delivery if it's out of your delivery zone.< /Review><resp>None<//resp><Rate>1</Rate><pics>None<//pics><Name>Heather< /Name></record>

Absolutely the worst - completely missed my delivery, and they don't answer their phone. Had to call my credit card to initiate a dispute and make this up to the recipient. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. (Sort by newest to see 5 other people who didn't get their deliveries, either!)<//review>

My husband placed a $106 Valentine order to be delivered to my work & it never got delivered! No phone call was ever made to notify my husband! He tried calling & no answer! He went to the store before they closed & they really didn't care!!! Never again placing another order from this place! Way to go in making business!< /Review>

<text>Unfortunately there is no lower grade than one star to give this store. I order from edible arrangements on a regular basis and this is by far the worst service I have ever received. I placed an order two days ago for Valentines day and the order still has not been delivered. The customer service is so bad that I had to call back 18 times and they had either left it off the hook for a busy signal or put me on hold in hopes that I would hang up. When I did reach someone, he said he will try his best to deliver my order even though I had paid extra. I recommend people read the reviews before they decide the store they place their order with.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

We will definitely never go here again. The guy who took our order, Aaron, was either drunk or high and it took two hours just to place an order for a birthday bouquet. When i picked out the one I wanted I was told it would take too long to make it and I had to pick another one. I asked for one that was about the size of a vase of flowers. He suggested one that came in a martini glass. I said no that wouldn't work and picked out a different one. It was supposed to be delivered at 5:00 pm but when I called at 6 it wasn't even done yet. When it was finally delivered it was the one in the martini glass that I didn't want! Not only that but it didn't even look good. Thanks for letting me down on my moms birthday bouquet. I hope everyone reads these reviews before they order and go somewhere else!</text>

<Review>Same situation as many other people on here.... did not receive my order on the day requested. After being on the phone with the driver (which was way overworked, felt bad for him as I took out my frustration at him surely wasn’t his fault, sorry again) seems like the fault here is the store manager. I have yet to receive a refund and it’s been 2 weeks. I ordered a gift for Valentine’s Day even paid extra for that day delivery, did receive it the next day, but still no use as it’s supposed to be a Vdays gift not next day Vday gift. On Valentine’s Day was calling and calling no one answered, called corporate, left a message, submitted emails and still no response besides a reference ticket being submitted. I’ve had edible arrangements delivery and products for many years now and have never experienced such delays and unresponsiveness from a company. I highly believe it is this store in particular.... my conclusion is either close this store or hire a new store manager.....

update: just found out they are issuing my refund after calling today (first time they answered) the original store manager quit in Vday. Leaving everyone like chickens whit their heads off.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Valentines Day failure...
How does it take 7hrs to deliver 12 chocolate covered strawberries 5mi away from your location?
My g/f never got a call, I get a call. "The receptionist rejected the order," yes because my g/f went home for the day!

I tried called ALL DAMN DAY to make sure they knew she leaves at 4pm. Guess there way to not deal w/ calls is take the phone off the hook. I called 16 times everytime a busy signal! Seriously???

i should've listen to the reviews. ordered chocolate dipped strawberry bouquet for valentines day in advanced, yup.. they never got delivered! so of course they ruined a special day for us. If you call it sounds busy or disconnected. so trying to talk to someone about it is useless. please read reviews!! DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE..<//Review>

<Review>So let me start off with I normally never leave bad reviews bc I hate to call someone out especially since we all make mistakes. But if you make a mistake you should just man up and fix it right. Well not with this location.

My fiancé was in town for work and it was her birthday and instead of buying her a cake or flowers I decided let me just order the confetti arrangement which was super cool bc it was a fake cake with a nice fruit mix.
Well come her birthday it wasn’t delivered so I was mad and called up the store and pleaded to “Daniel” the store manager to make sure to resend it. They did right away and she got. Too bad she didn’t get the arrangement I ordered. She actually got a completely different one. She called me up wondering why I sent that arrangement and why would it be a get well soon arrangement.
I was wondering what she was talking about till she sent me a picture. I immediately called up the store and told them they sent the wrong arrangement and they said they knew they said the wrong one didn’t have the confetti arrangement no more. So I asked them why would they send one that had get well soon when it was her birthday and I paid a lot more for the confetti arrangement then the little pitiful arrangement that they send. So they assured me they would give me a refund I told him that I would be in town the following week for work myself and that I could pick up the refund in person so I go for three days in a row and every time I go they made a different excuse why they couldn’t refund me the money and now almost a month later I finally got a hold of Daniel on the phone and he said that they can’t do the refund. So I talk to the corporate office and they assured me that they have a guarantee for customer satisfaction and that they’re sending me a check and just deducting it from the store location so if you ever have A problem and you can’t solve it with the store manager don’t worry just call of customer service and they have a customer satisfaction guarantee. I have literally ordered over 100 times with edible arrangements never one time have I had a problem until I ordered it with this store. Edible arrangements in my opinion is a five star and it hurts me to give the store a one star but if I could I would give them no stars.<//Review>< rating>

Horrible experience. Ordered two weeks in advance for my wife's birthday and it wasn't delivered by 4 PM. At which point we were leaving for the evening. Called them and cancelled the order. Raphael, who said he was the manager, was no help at all. He just said that they are only responsible to deliver it before 7 PM on the day of the order. DO NOT order anything from them. Terrible and awful customer service.</text>

<Review>So I decided to go against my better judgement and the bad reviews and ordered an arrangement for vday it was never delivered. They called informing me so and asked if I would like it delivered the next day I said "sure " giving them the benefit of the doubt after all, it is a pretty busy day for them. The next day however, shouldn't have been to hectic and still left the order unfulfilled. they called me again this time inquiring if the order had been met, which again was answered with a no we're now on day three, 3pm and they still haven't delivered at this point I just want them to keep trying to see if they can actually fulfill an order<//Review>< pictures>

We will never order from this location ever again!😠<//text><Gmap_id>0x80dcdc9aa024629f:0x5f5016319db9c069< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The products is fine, but the people in the front is just 'bad'. They are actually very friendly, but they had no idea how to make a smoothee according to the recipe. An order promised in 30min was not done for 2 hours. It also came out different from what they described.<//review>

< Review>
If I could leave zero stars I would. My husband bought a Valentine's day arrangement for me today and it was never delivered. My work is literally a block away from the shop in Irvine and When my husband called to find out the status they said it was en route. It never made it and when he called to let them know the girl he spoke to on the phone said it would be delivered TODAY!!!! She told him they would call me to arrange delivery and it is now 10:30 PM, I never received a call and I never got the delivery. The worst part is that my husband called and told them he wanted it canceled and they refused! Because it was supposedly still going to be delivered today. This is the worst edible arrangements store I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I will be calling the store manager tomorrow, filing a complaint and I will be calling my bank to reverse the charges because of the refusal to cancel an order that never had any intention of arriving.<//Review>

I don't recommend going to this place. Their chocolate covered strawberries are ugly. They leave the leaves on the strawberries and they are all shriveled and brown. The chocolate coat is a hard shell so when you bite into it, the chocolate crumbles off the fruit. I rather just make chocolate covered fruit myself.</review>

I ordered an arrangement 2 days in advance for my mother .  the day it was supposed to be delivered  I called at 11:30am they lie and say it was on it's way , I called back at 2:00pm and said the same thing !! So Gave another call at 4:30 and now the manager said that the order was still there at the store and it should be delivered by 5:30 or so !!! Passed 5:30 and nothing . Horrible horrible service !!! Nothing but liars . I will never ever order something from here ..< /Review>

My first impression of this Dermatology office was beautiful, clean and professional. The front desk staff are professional and friendly. I was seen by Nurse Danielle, who made me feel comfortable and relaxed. I’ve had some skin issues for a while now and she has helped clear up most of my adult acne, I love my results so far! She explains everything as she goes and answers all of my questions. Oh, and a little Botox never hurt anyone 😉<//review>

I am so glad to have found this Amazing Dermatologist through Google. They took me in for a same-day appointment, offered me great service, and their office was truly beautiful. If you're looking for an amazing dermatologist, you've come to the right place. Thank you Dr. Newman and Staff!<//text>

Dr.  Newman, Danielle and the rest of the team in the office are amazing and super friendly!   They have a vast knowledge and experience treating patients of all races. I’ve been a patient for almost 3 months, initially sought treatment for a severe breakout from mask that wouldn’t go away.  I’m seeing great improvements and definitely recommend their services!<//review>

<review>First impression coming into this office it was clean, love the decor and the staff was extremely friendly and attentive as soon as you walk in the door. Not like a regular snooty dermatologist office where they don't pay any attention to you and make you a bit intimidated for even going. That set the tone for the entire visit.

After getting a consultation and a plan from Dr. Newman; who is highly knowledgeable in everything dermatology and more. He immediately made me feel comfortable and listened to what I wanted.

Nurse Danielle gave me my first treatment today and although I felt a bit embarrassed of my skin; I've never actually been one to go to a dermatologist or even get a facial and I'm 35! She made me throw my worries way and made the appointment a breeze. She was professional, friendly and well versed in all of the treatments that they recommended. She was able to answer all of my questions, refreshing how knowledgeable she was. The lasers and peels targeted my skin issues... I scar or get brown spots easily and I had a few pimple like cysts that she was able to take care of. I can't wait to continue going there (even though the drive is 1.5 hrs for me coming from OC - it shows that it's worth it!).

Thank you Dr. Newman, Nurse Danielle and the team for making my first visit an amazing one. Can't wait to see the results and feel more confident in my skin.<//review>< user_id>

I went to four other doctors for my inflammations and not one took the time to help me they would each give me a little tube of antibiotic 0.01% which is nothing and one doctor came in the room with one bandage said this should take care of it????  So when Dr Newman came in and throughly checked all of my sores and infections I was thrilled to see that he relieved my pain right away ,and each time they got better and better so thank you wonderful Doctor and all of your very nice staff i am forever grateful.</Review>

I've known Dr. Newman since his early starts. Not only is he the hardest working doctor, but he and his staff are the most courteous, caring, and professional people you could ever meet. The office itself is beautiful. My skin has never felt and looked better since I've been under his treatment. I travel 30 miles one way just to be treated by him. Dr. Newman is definitely the best Dermatologist in Los Angeles. If you want your skin to look the best, you must visit his office.<//text>

<Review>Appt. date March 23, 2021: I really don’t know how this doctor has any patients. He was so rude and uninterested in giving me a proper consultation. I actually called him out on it, I said hey come on, I’ve taken time out of my day and paid $125 for a consultation,  do your job... I have questions! I normally would have requested a refund but I was too busy to argue with the front desk over 100 bucks. Let’s just say I definitely will not be returning. He didn’t even bother to properly look into what type of insurance I have. He’s out of network for me but he said I have HMO insurance by glancing at my card but that’s not true,  I have PPO, which is irrelevant regardless cause most the doctors I go to don’t even accept insurance no matter what type you have but this guy is def not worth paying for out of pocket. It also seems as if his practice is a little outdated as they do not offer a lot of modern procedures like PRP facials and their lasers looked outdated.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bbfe41dd8145:0xd11f89e17b1c0432< /gmap_id><Rating>1< /Rating><name>Kaveh Espili<//name>< date>

I'm so glad my sister found this doctor, he is a great dermatologist he takes the time to not only check what you are there for but he listens to you and doesn't judge or cuts you off as many other doctors do when you go in for a consult, he explains what he needs to do, or to see what procedure or treatment he needs to do for you. When I came back with my mom to get the results of the biopsy of the skin spots on her cheek and ear he took the time to explain to us what the results were, he explained to both of us in the exam room, then he took me to another waiting room to explain to me in detail what the results were and the procedure he was going to do for her. He was carrying and understandin enough to see that my mom was so nervous so he did that out of respect and I so appreciated that gesture on his behalf. That same day Carlos started the first session of treatment (scraping off) it's how I can explain it, since then she's been going every four weeks to do laser treatments BRITTANY (I hope I wrote it correctly) has been doing them and all I can say is that we couldn't have gotten a better nurse to tend to her needs, she is amazing she's gentle and patient with my mom as she is a nervous wreck when ever she goes to any medical office. The entire staff is very nice and professional in every aspect, they make you feel welcomed and relaxed when you go in the office, even the valet gentleman and the lady security guard at the entrance are so nice and attentive with everyone. Also as for cleanliness during this Civic 19 pandemic they have sanitation stations from the time you come out your car to inside the entire building, the staff and all patients are required to wear a face covering and needles to say the office is spotless.
I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT EVERYONE GOES TO THIS DERMATOLOGIST DR. ARMAND NEWMAN IS THE BEST</text>

Dr. Newman and his team are the absolute best. I've been going for over a year and even after moving out of LA, I still make the drive because of the quality of work. I could tell a huge difference in my skin, even after the first visit.  The front desk staff is so warm and welcoming. The RN, Danielle, makes it easy to look forward to my next visit. She is very professional and always makes me feel comfortable.</Review>

I've been seeing Dr Newman for a couple years now for tattoo removal. I have multiple tattoos that needed to be removed and he explained that it will be a process to remove but explained it will be a realistic goal to have. A year later my tattoos are completely gone and I'm so happy that I don't have to live with them for the rest of my life. His lasers are top of the line & I would highly recommend him for tattoo removal</text>

Dr. Newman is the finest dermatologist I've ever known, and I've met a number of them in my 67 years. I've suffered from acne, basal cell carcinomas, and cysts all my life. He tackled all my problems brilliantly. He's intelligent and kind. We discuss literature, philosophy, and history sometimes. He's wonderful. Moreover, his staff is friendly and smart. I've been going to him for ten years. I highly recommend this team.<//review>

March 4, 2020. Do not waste your time, or your money. Originally agreed on $250 for the removal of a skin condition. The nurses steered me towards a less intrusive method, which did not work. Subsequently charging me more and more for each visit. Meanwhile, $1300 later, I still have the skin condition. I don’t believe the dermatologist is board-certified. Do your homework! Completely unprofessional, and predatory.< /Text>

pon finding a painful lump that needed immediate care I my sheer luck with my research of the best skin doctors in Los Angeles was seen the same day after I had already made another appointment for the next day. The reception was so positive from the lovely staff and the doctor was so experienced that my stress of the painful lump was resolved. Then being 40 years in Asia in the sun they immediately assisted me by checking my whole body. The doctor and staff did above and beyond all the doctors I've experienced in my 70 years and especially in Los Angeles where I have been treated so shabbily from the doctors just trying to made money on useless tests and procedures. I fully know everyone needs a skin doctor for their family,s needs and I hope they find Dr Newman and his nurse Danielle< /review>

<text>Wow so amazing, I have to thank DR Newman and his staff for helping my sons Skin Condition and helping us understand what not to do and how to heal my sons skin. They took the time to explain to my 5 year old son and my self how to take care of his skin condition and how to use the products as well and made sure we were comfortable with our instructions.

His products works like miracles! The cleanser for face and body and cream for severe dry skin has erased my sons dry skin and eczema.

Remember he is located in Beverly Hills, you get what you pay for and Dr Newman is the BEST!
I took my son else where prior to finding Dr Newman, for his skin condition and they prescribed a few creams and ointments but made it worse, if anything. So no more going around for price cuts here.
Dr Newman's visit was a reasonable price for Beverly Hills and he cured my sons skin.

Thank you DR Newman.</text><date>1567984274813<//date>< user>

<Text>This was a terrible experience! He was the worst doctor I have ever been to. So rude and demeaning! He way overcharged me based on my insurance copay. It was a total scam. Only pushed his own lasers that were not covered by insurance instead of treatments that are. It was such a terrible experience to go through after waiting in the lobby for over 2 hours! I have no idea how he is in business and has return patients. I would Never reccommend this doctor. If felt as if I was in a country where a patients couldn't ask a question without being repromanded. I don't know if this man has a problem with female patients, but he was so rude and degrading I couldn't even believe it!< /Text>< Gmap_id>

I have been calling the business all night. I am a gay man and waited in line like everyone else. I was with two women. The man at the front let my two friends in and told me to wait. He let over 5 people go in ahead of me while I was waiting on the side. I questioned him and that pissed him off and he made me wait longer. I did cause a scene because I was angry and I felt belittled. I had an ID AND I AM over 21 just like everyone else. So whoever was working 11/10/18 at the gate needs some freshening up on equality because it was unfair and WRONG !!!!<//text>

Service 0.... ordered a double apple hookah no flavor what so ever, the holes in the foil are minimal and the air flow is horrible.. the place looks nice but the hookah quality fails giving this place a 1 star... and that's being generous.. u guys need to train the hookah chef waaaaybbetter<//Review>

A friend invited me here for the first time it was very chill.  till certain employees began walking in around 7 pm all the employees cuss while engaging in interaction with each other.   spitting profanity in front of me and whoever was there they we're all just swearing all loud around the place they show no professionalism.  Some female employee there was  playing around saying she'd stab her fellow co worker   in the eye .  Also it  seems like these employees sex play eachother from what i saw that night .  they show no professionalism  at all .<//text>

What happened was unfortunate, but that gentleman was caught hitting a girl and then wanting to fight her male friend. He was escorted out then tried to fight back in. What that video that the public seen was the guard protecting himself and all the others around. See what you didn’t see as well as  others was him threatening the guards and him reaching for his pants. So when u say the guards rough people up and management doesn’t care, well I’m sorry you feel that way because that statement is absolutely false! For anyone else that may read this please keep in mind there is always more than one side to a story! SAFETY IS ALWAYS A PRIORITY'}<//Response>< Gmap_id>

It's fine - meh. Good part of town. Feels like a super judgy unwelcoming atmosphere. Its always dead. Ordered hookah, took a long time to get it so I walked to the back to see what was going on as there was no employee on the floor. Peeked my head around the corner and there was my hookah, coals ready, they just hadn't brought it out because the oy dude working there on the clock was making out and groping with what looked like a stripper. To each his own, but just don't hold up my order for it ya know?<//Review>

So from your response your alternative is to lock yourself in your house, oh wait people get hurt there too...\nPlease understand this is not the fault of the business it's the actions of people that have bad judgment and it's not fair to point the finger at the business! Especially since it was in the parking lot.  I am very sorry that this happened and we all wish that these kind of things don't happen but unfortunately that's not the world we live in. We can not live in fear! Please remember that our community needs to stick together and not divide, thank you!"}<//Resp>

I'm a 64 y/o Harley rider. My wife was shopping around town. I went in to an empty bar, walked in waved to the young man on  the outdoor smoking patio. He turned out to be the bartender. I made some small talk and joined he and friends outside (smokers). They all were very welcoming. Asked if there was anywhere in the shade,  they said hey park right here next to the glass block wall. I drank up said I may see you at the live music later. I went back got the good parking place and danced from 7:30 till 1:30. Thanks all you young people. Had a great night. Highly recommended!<//Review>

< review>
Peri's Silver Dollar bar is a bar and entertainment venue in Fairfax. One of the two main music venues in town and both are institutions. Fairfax has a long history of good musicians and local bands. Just tonight two 'guest performers' dropped in and played and /or sang with the scheduled band on the 'patio' which is an outdoor room without windows. Uniquely Fairfax. The 'patio' band starts around 5.00pm and plays till around 8:00pm. No food served here and it is on a cash only basis. There is an outside area in back where locals relax and play ping-pong until the main band starts up at 9:00pm.
The music is good and you don't get shorted on the drinks. If you enjoy music, Peri's is good.<//review>

Sound was not great but you don't expect that in a venue like this, it's a bar basically. There are a few separate rooms where they have pool in one, and a smoking area in the other.<//Text>< pics>

Iconic Peri's.   I am not a bar person so take my review with a grain of salt.    (It smells like vomit from the street).  Other than that it is an amazing hip busy fun place where people play great music and meet up for drinks.  .... a Fairfax must.< /review>

<text>Fun bar with a solid beer selection. The bartenders are friendly but busy. On a Tuesday I saw an aireal, fire, hula hoop, and vaudeville show. You never know what you you are going to get. Something for everyone, my mom really appreciated the entertainment! 👍🍻🎶</text>< Pics>

Good drinks, good beers, good prices, good music. For non-smokers the patio can get pretty smoky: unfortunate when the band you want to listen to is out there.</Review>

There's always a different crowd everynight. Live music. Pool tables. Out for seating. It's a great place to grab a drink and chill out. There's room to dance.  Its a cool local bar people of all ages (over 21) go to relax have fun and catch up.</Review>

Our goto spot for years. Not a place for giant rolls, but for simply and deliciously done sushi. The Chef’s Choice dinner is very reasonably priced for what you get.</review>

Went around 5pm on a Monday and got in with no wait (little line grew behind us after we sat), but the staff and chef do an amazing job of getting the food out quickly and the customers moving! I love the variety selection options, my boyfriend and I split the 6 rolls and 2 extra salmon rolls! Super filling and incredibly tasty! Highly recommend</review>< Pictures>

I have been dining here for sixteen years and the quality of food has always been outstanding. So this review is not about food it is about the price. I love the food here so much that if I am in the area between 11 and 2:00 pm I will place a takeout order and grab it on my way back to Ventura. Yesterday, I checked the online menu and walked in to place a takeout order. I ordered a blue crab hand roll the price was six dollars and the Anaconda roll for thirteen dollars. When the bill came I was charged twenty eight dollars. I thought wow tax has really gone up in Los Angeles county! After walking back to my car I rechecked the online menu again and called the restaurant regarding being overcharged by nine dollars. I as told they had increased prices three months ago and that the hand roll was eight dollars and the Anaconda roll was not thirteen it was eighteen dollars. I stated the online price which had not been corrected and she said she didn't know anything about it. So, sadly after all of these years and referring countless friends and family to dine here I will have to put this on my maybe once a year experience instead of multiple times and will not be referring anyone else. The cost of doing business is dictating how they treat customers and their customers are clearly not important to keep.< /Text>

Sat at sushi bar and immediately told there was a minimim if we sat at bar. Then were told how we were supposed to eat our sushi. "No Wasabi!". Whatever. Dining experience terrible due to unwelcoming and unfriendly, snobby woman sushi chef. Spend over $100 for 2 people left hungry and totally unsatisfied.</text></record></dataset><record>

Asked for a menu at the bar and was denied although there was a menu sitting on every (emtpy) table in the place.  I came for a quick bite to eat with my boyfriend and was pressured to order a certain amount of items from the bar.  No cell phone usage allowed.  Extremely pricey.  No prices on the bill, only a total of $80+.  Would not recommend.  Go to the other Sushi Spot on Ventura Blvd because they have much friendlier/laid back service.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>1< /Rating>< username>

<Text>Fantastic fish, highest quality sushi prepared by a true master chef.  Not sure why these people give it low ratings, most likely they are used to mayonnaise roll style bars that chop up and mince inferior quality fish, or prefer non-traditional style sushi that is nothing but rolls rolls rolls with crunchy tidbits on top, because this place is the bomb. The owner takes great care to serve the best fish, in correct order, in correct portions.  He will guide you as to what to use soy sauce on, what not too.  This place is as good as any omakase resaurant on the Westside, and a hidden gem.  Those of you that know good sushi will love this place.  If you would like to learn what real sushi is all about, and eat some very interesting and different fish that is delicious then go here.  The others - well, go back to sushi by numbers at Sugar Fish or Sushi Planet!  One other thing, for omakase this place is VERY reasonably priced.</Text>< date>

Amazing sushi - sushi chefs come here to eat. Lunch time has great deals, especially if you like hamachi kama. Dinner time, the omakase is amazing. Amazing fresh fish for a reasonable price. This was my go to sushi spot in the valley. Definitely give this place a try.<//Review>

We are the only two cars in the lot parked right outside the window in plane view. Just sayin. ..brand new porsche and new 650i BMW. . We walk in and lady says "party of 2". We say yes... she precedes to put us in the back right corner not at sushi bar. We tell them that we want to be at the bar. She then sys "you know you have to order 4 order minimum sir". I look at her puzzled and say that's okay. She does not pull out chairs or menu, then says "minimum 4 order" again. What a freak... like people can't afford their food. They will never get a penny out of me or anyone I know. But, guess they don't care since they don't think I have one.</review>< date>

phenomenal... i never write reviews for anything but just scrolling thru random places i like, i noticed idiots giving this place 1/2 stars. the story of it's existence is worth 5 stars, the master chefs are worth 5 stars, the quality of the food is worth 5 stars. it's top quality, it's literally the place Los Angeles best sushi chefs go to get their fix in. do not pay attention to the california roll dorks embarrassing themselves talking this place down. it's fantastic.....if you do enjoy the cali rolls and tempura have a seat at a table. cuzz dem the rules.</review>

Small Latin supermarket, kind of pricy, if you compare US dollar with any Latin American pesos.
You find product from more of the central an South American countries.</review>

<Text>I was able to get so many Colombian products at this store that I wasn't able to get in any other latino store such as arepas de choclo, arepas con queso, papas criollas, chocoramos, jugos hit, etc. I also got yuca, ñame and green plantains. They have a wide variety of latin american cheeses, tropical fruits' pulps and Colombian liquor! They also have guaraná and other Brazilian products.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) It has many things but everything very about the price and they do not have much hygiene. They sell hot tamales on a tray next to the checkout. The regular if it is hot it needs to remain in something hot and if it is cold it needs to be on ice. I told them and they were offended. They believe that everything they do is right and it is not. Their food is not good. Very bad quality

(Original)
Tiene muchas cosas pero todo muy sobre el precio y no tienen mucha higiene. Venden tamales calientes sobre una charola al lado de la caja. Lo regular si esta caliente necesita seguir en algo caliente y si esta frío necesita estar en hielo. Les dije y se ofendieron. Creen que todo lo que ellos hacen esta bien y no es así. Su comida no es buena. Muy mala calidad< /text>

<text>Lots of old world funky charm at this sandwich shop. Really nice staff puts a lot of attention into each sandwich... In our case, two fat breakfast burritos with turkey sausage and cheddar. Pretty good coffee.</text>< Pictures>

Unreal egg and cheese on a bagel. Dense, flavorful, but soft asiago bagel. Egg, cheese, and turkey cooked to perfection.< /Text>

<Review>A lovely casual café with a old authentic feel and very friendly staff, who served us an awesome large mug of coffee Mocha and delicious rapidly served hot sandwich. Secure WiFi, easily accessible for those who physically need it and very comfy seating with a bit of window view if you fancy. My only complaint, very warm inside and a little pricy, but otherwise recommended 😸</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<rate>1</rate><review>Called in orders for sandwiches multiple times and they are never ready for pickup.

The second time we waited until 10 minutes after they were supposed to be ready to pick them up and they started making them after we arrived at the counter.

The third time we gave them an extra 20 minutes,still they werent ready when we arrived.

The service is terrible and slow. They are always out of a good portion of the menu.

Do yourself a favor and skip this location.</review>< Pics>

Easily the worst subway I've ever been to. Slow service, argumentative employees (shift lead is the epitome of someone who hates his job). I was stoked when they put in a Subway near Wildwood but this one is trash. Doesn't even deserve one star.</review>

<text>Went to try PV subway for the first time last night at 6:56pm. The young girl said I can't make you food. I have bread to put away and stuff. Hours posted  are open until 8pm. She said she won't get paid after 8pm and had to finish closing routine. If you don't serve food before 7pm your sign should not say open until 8pm. Won't be back.</text><username>Cindy Clark</username>< date>

Always out of half of their meat and bread no matter if you come first thing or in the afternoon have been twice and they had no pepperoni or turkey or white bread.... for a place not frequently trafficked it’s pretty bad for them to always be out of stuff.</text>

They messed up my order and asked me to return to the store and they would make me another sandwich, so I started to drive back and about half way in they call me back and ask me to bring the original sandwich back and to pay for the replacement sandwich... after saying this the employee quickly says no I'll pay for the sandwich since it was my fault. So I continue driving there and when I get there they hand me a bag of cold bacon and a tub of sauce. Thats it, no new sandwich no sorry for the inconvenience just cold bacon. Honestly I laughed for a couple minutes in the parking lot because I thought it was a joke and a camera crew would run out laughing but nope just let down by subway once again, but its the last time since I'm never returning.</review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>Terrible service, extremely unprofessional. The 3 girls that were working were talking bad on there coworkers the whole time and one had her shirt tied above her belly button so her whole stomach and back was showing, she removed and put her ask back on multiple times while making the sandwiches, also very rude and disrespectful to the customer's. Not to mention, waited 20 minutes for 3 sandwiches because they were to busy talking to eachother about the other workers that were supposed to come in.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>It's a normal subway, however they are often understaffed and the staff that is there is fairly slow, which leads to a bit of a wait. Do yourself a favor and order online.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Subway has really cut down on toppings for sandwiches! Kind of disappointing when you have more bread then toppings. Service is really lacking.<//Text>

I was rear ended earlier this month and Dr. Mitchell’s office was the only place that accepted me as a patient using my own auto insurance coverage.  This meaning nothing out of pocket for me.  When I called his office staff was very professional and informative.  I spoke with Veronica and she put my worries at ease explaining they could help me.  Dr. Mitchell is greatly recommended, down to earth and knowledgeable.  It’s only been 2 weeks but their office has been a God’s sent, literally.  If you need a good experienced doctor with friendly staff, Tulare Chiropractic Clinic is where to go!!!
Thanks! Veronica Venegas-<//text>

The staff is very welcoming. They greet you like family as soon as you step in the door. The doc is awsome. His techniques have helped both my daughter and me. Im a disabled veteran with a long history of back problems. I haven't felt this much relief in a long time.  Couldn't be happier with the service.< /Text>

Never in my life did I think of going to chiropractic doctor until I got into a car accident. I got a whiplash that led into multiple aches around my body. At one point I could not even move my neck sideways because of severe pain on my shoulder. But after my first adjustment session I felt like a different person. I could move my back, shoulder and neck without pain. It was truly an amazing experience. Dr. Mitchell and his staffs are doing a miracle work here. I’m so thankful for their excellent service and care. Everyone is super friendly here. Highly recommend!!< /review>

What can I say but, if it wasn't for Dr.Mitchell and his staff I would of had a really bad work week. I travel quite a bit for work and I happened to have gotten hurt a day before my trip. Found Dr.Mitchell and he was able to help with my lower back pain due to a herniated lower disk. Thank you for making my work week a bit less painful.< /Text>

<text>Dr. Mitchell and his staff are always professional and welcoming.
Dr. Mitchell has changed the quality of my life through his consistent care. Consistent being the key word!  His work is a reflection of his medical approach, sound and researched experience. I had another physician tell me what my neck issues were and I said, “that’s exactly what my chiropractor told me.” His response, “then just keep doing what you’re doing.”
I no longer experience hand numbness or chronic hip pain. What a relief!< /text>< rate>

I’ve been to a lot of chiropractors and Dr Mitchell is the literally the best! I’ve struggled with pain for years. Since being under Dr Mitchell’s care I have found relief from my pain. I haven’t felt this good in years! I highly recommend Dr Mitchell.< /Review>

I've been having back pain for 4 years, and have tired regular doctors and meds . Nothing was working. I have just recently started seeing Dr. Mitchell  and have already improved  significantly. Dr. Mitchell is great at explaining thing things, and his natural approach to healing is working.  His decompression  machine is amazing and is giving the desired results.
As an added bonus,  I happened to be in the office when the staff were discussing needing to add another employee.  I mentioned that I would be interested in working in the office and got the job.  The office is incredible from the doctor, the treatment, the staff and the care given.<//text>

I first saw Dr. Mitchell after a car accident. He got me back on my feet right away. I went on to join the Rub Club so that I stay in great condition by getting routine adjustments and massages. I have always been very happy with Dr. Mitchell and his staff!!</review>

Dr. Mitchell is the man!

Best in the business!!

I have had several injuries over the last 10 yrs and I have used Dr. Mitchell's talents to get me back on my feet.
He is a very high skilled doctor who actually cares about his patients and listens to their needs.
If you are having trouble with your back and neck go see this doctor, he will help you!!!!

Thank You Dr. Mitchell</text>

Entire staff is  amazing. Always offering  hospitality and sensitivity to my pain. Always quick to get me into office in a pinch.  And never a wait when scheduled. I was told my two doctors I needed surgery, but Dr Mitchell treated me and my pain is gone. Now I managed very well and go in monthly for maintenance o oh. I feel Great!<//text>

Dr. Mitchell always fixes what ails me! In the first few weeks of treatments I had so much relief from chronic neck pain and fatigue. Easy to schedule, and convenient to have an appointment with a massage therapist and chiropractor in the same time frame at the same office. Thanks Doc!</review>

I want to express my honest appreciation for the excellent care and the genuine concern Dr. Steven Mitchell has shown to me over the past 15 years or so at the Tulare Chiropractic Clinic. A friend referred me to Dr. Mitchell after a car accident left me with considerable soreness and pain in my back.  He worked with me treating the cause of my injuries, taking his time and never hurrying me through any appointment.  The positive effects of his chiropractic care are unquestionable and always make me feel that I am "in good hands."  About twice a year, I will suffer a recurring muscle spasm associated with pain and mobility problems.  Dr. Mitchell has always made time to see me immediately, and provide the proper treatment to bring instant relief.  He is extremely knowledgeable, professional, kind and courteous and always available to address my concerns and questions about my symptoms, post care, and exercise.  Dr. Mitchell has always gotten to the heart of the problem effectively and efficiently, and he is a Doctor who cares more about YOU and your well being than money.  Many thanks to Dr. Mitchell and I give my highest recommendation to you and the Tulare Chiropractic Clinic.<//text>

<review>Fabulous! The visit here was exceptional! I ordered the waffle and chicken benedict with diced potatoes on the side. The presentation of the plate was superb and the flavors were incredible! I would highly recommend giving this family owned baker/cafe a try! The pastries are also fantastic and go well with the delicious coffee. The dinning area was well maintained, the staff was very friendly professional and welcoming! The parking was a breeze and the wait time for the food to arrive after order was reasonable 😊< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqhb-KN-H4k6UAOtIpvFdXUpHMzWCMuWIc_tu1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<text>This bakery is family owned and operated. With staff that is always friendly and doing their best to allow you and your loved ones to feel comfortable and enjoy yourselves. This place is a staple of the community with food that is ALWAYS top notch, bakery items that are above and beyond always, and care given to every customer. If you see a line, it's worth the wait. I can NOT tell you how much this little bakery means to my little family. They know our faces, they've learned our names, they've earned our trust. This. Place. Cant. Be. Beat.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNjGoYJtpQNdcL09o-o8bv9GkptNDxQ3jAQGNN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Response>

I had an iced vanilla latte, and a pecan twist. Both were delicious. I got my daughter the Avocado Toast. She said it tasted good. This item seemed a bit pricey for the serving amount.<//text>

This may be one of the best bakeries I've eaten at. I really do mean that. I've eaten at bakeries around the world. From New Zealand to Japan and from England to Vietnam and this one really pulls it off.

I think the key part of a good Bakery is being able to pull off a delicious crusty crust while keeping a soft chewy mid. This Bakery Aces that task and all the pastries I've tried there have so far surprised the heck out of me.

Also, they have a great breakfast menu!</Text>

Hands down, the best bakery in Socal! We come here every time we visit Oceanside, CA. Highly recommend the California benedict or the chicken and waffles benedict. Their cheesecakes are perfection!!! NY or Chocolate turtle, you can't go wrong.<//Review>

My favorite breakfast place ever, for almost 10 years I've been going. Best service and best food! Today, one of the staff members recognized me by name after coming back a year later! Oceanside is nothing without this place ❤️❤️< /Review>

<Text>We bought a variety of items from here today and all I can say is the pastries are amazing. My only complaint is that they use too much almond extract in their icing, but for their items that use little or no icing, you can't go wrong.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

This place is absolutely delicious 😋Lots of options when it comes to food and desserts! The only thing I didn’t like was the wait time to get our breakfast. There was only about three tables before us and we ended up waiting over 30 minutes. But other than that detail everything was great!</Text>

Since arriving in Oceanside, CA 4 days ago, I have eaten five meals at Petite Madeline. Today it is cold and rainy, so I have spent the whole day here working, eating breakfast and lunch, savoring delicious Mexican Mocha and enjoying the gracious staff, as well as, the company of other enthusiastic patrons. Highly recommend this cafe/bakery/restaurant/coffee bar.< /Review>

The only bad thing about this place is they are closed 2 days out of the week. One other thing too is they use whipped cream for the eclairs not the custard :/
But otherwise great.< /Review>

<text>Got to be the closest thing to a French bakery I’ve had in the US. The pastries are flaky but moist and have just the right amount of sweetness without being overpoweringly sweet. Plus, the bakery is locally owned and the staff are extremely professional and kind.

Pro-tip: Try the chocolate croissants 🔥</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHbpp1U4cV_HXU_it-0Gdrtr9POibjwBMcRsXa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK7klcb_keVUC8hz-95mbLdZs0OP7xpeAdmmKk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

We get pasteries here every Thursday.  They're fantastic!   Before Covid19, we often are breakfast or lunch.  They're wonderful too.  Everyone there is polite and helpful.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

The staff and owner is the best, they were so helpful when we encountered a situation that was  unexpected.  It was my birthday and  decided to search for the best bakery in Oceanside, the first name that popped up was Petite Madeline Bakery, not only were the staff and owner caring the desserts are  delicious.</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Petite Madeline has become a mainstay of authentic local cuisine. An eclectic menu caters to an ethnically diverse local population hungry for everything from beef brisket, to salmon, prosciutto and freshly prepared mozzarella, French Nicoise salad, omletts, and bakery treats... to name just a few. The ambiance is coastal casual, while the prices are far less than you'd expect for a restaurant 5 minutes walking distance from the beach!<//Review>< pics>

<text>This was an awesome place to go to. Next time I'm in Oceanside I'm definitely going to take the extra trip to go over there. The pastries were always fresh and definitely one of kind flavor. Madeleine's bakery is definitely one of those Oceanside treats that you have to stop by and taste for yourself 😉<//text>< Date>

Such a fabulous breakfast experience for two adults and two small children. There were so many choices but we each ordered something different and our plates were clean, our stomachs full, and it was fun to talk about what we just ate. Everyone was nice and we had several conversations with the waitress and hostess. We will return for dessert sometime, again, so much to choose from.< /Text>

Just stopped in to get coffee and hot chocolate. Normal cafe experience, though if you are just getting coffee or hot chocolate. There are cheaper options offering the same or better quality.</Review>

After eating lunch near the Oceanside pier, we went looking for ice cream. Instead of ice cream we found this bakery, and are we glad we did. We were traveling for the weekend so we stocked up on goodies. The peach pastry had crust that was light and flaky. The peanut butter cookie is a cross between a light sugar cookie and a peanut butter cookie. Best of all is the Meltaway, a shortbread cookie that is light and it melts in your mouth. The bakery clearly uses top quality ingredients. We highly recommend this bakery.</text>

<text>Truly fantastic experience! Insanely nice staff. True food service professionals. The espresso was well prepared, milk foamed to perfection(they use a lighter flavor profile of espresso). The California Benedict is fabulous! The hollandaise is obviously fresh made from scratch, rich and delicate. The english muffin was chewy and crunchy in all the best ways! This is a spot that knows food and puts love into what they're doing,  can't reccomend them strongly enough!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Awesome food but expect a wait and under par service. I mean the staff look like good people but are running around too busy to help anyone coming thru the door. Seems like business is good regardless so I suggest hiring out more staff or consulting someone to help with operations and customer service. Definitely cool spot but I felt as though I was more of a nuisance for choosing this place instead of a welcomed customer where staff are ready to serve and fulfill customer needs.

There was a point to my visit when I was denied being sold a cup of coffee. It was just going to be simple, I mean I drink it black, nothing special. **Sadness<//Review><UserId.>116124442725122675448<//UserId.><response>None<//response>< pictures>

This sit-down/takeout Café Bakery is the place to go in downtown Oceanside for delicious food and drinks! Part-coffee shop, part-bakery, Petite Madeline delivers in both delicious coffee and other beverages, as well as treats and food. I highly suggest their chocolate pyramid cake<//text>

<text>Excellent cafe with a semi-new age menu. House specialty and regular menu items are uniformly good. Don't sit near the pastry display or your diet will suffer from frustration. Try to avoid great beach weather days as the foot traffic goes sky high and with some restrictions still in place, lines may form outside  (indoor dining is now possible). Then again,  if you get a table by the windows the people watching is also great.<//text>< gmapID>

Full breakfast menu and lunch. Smiles everywhere, even when they first open and coffee hasn't kicked in yet, they're smiling.  Ownership here does it right.   Great place.< /review>< pics>

<review>I wandered in one beautiful day shortly before closing to eye the bakery and assess whether my husband and I should stop in for breakfast. We will...definitely! The single serving cheesecakes were works of art and staff was most helpful.  Leaving with an additional coconut macaroon (GF!) I enjoyed relaxing by the Oceanside library fountain just across Coast Hwy 1 from the entrance.  Our cheesecake made a lovely dessert for two. Reasonably priced; really does taste ‘from scratch’.< /review><user_name>Lauren Brimmer<//user_name>< resp>

The dishes and pastries here are well thought out, artfully constructed and most importantly, absolutely delicious. The staff are wonderful. The prices are ridiculously affordable. High quality food that doesn't come at a high price. Everything here from the facilities to the coffee is spot on. Love this place!<//Review>

<Review>I really like the pastries here they are quite delicious, but I feel like they kind of jack the prices just because they're downtown. there's a place on Mission Avenue next to the police station that is just as delicious but a tad more reasonable. They have my business now.< /Review><userid>106998513331305135094</userid></record>

<Review>Just on corner of main Street, a busy and quality little bakery and restaurant. The staff was most helpful and family loved the delicacies we're enjoyed in our beach front rental. Walking distance to the Pier. Small town feel! Never had a bad time in Oceanside!</Review>< rate>

<Review>This is a really good place to eat. It's a little on the expensive side when you compare it to the other breakfast places but it's worth it. Seating fills up very quickly on the weekend. I have eaten here before and loved this time decided to branch out from my normal and try one of there breakfast corsintini and crepes loved them.<//Review>< Pics>

They set up a long table for our group of 11.  We ordered at the counter and the beautiful delicious food came quickly.  They give you a real mug for coffee.  Sadly you pay for refills.   Not too noisy for conversation.  I will be back soon. Thanks<//Review>

<date>1549852987356</date><text>I don’t often order an omelette. For me, that’s usually only the safe choice when I can’t find anything truly appealing. 99% of omelets are scrambled eggs with mediocre ingredients. But for some reason, I was intrigued by the offering at Petite Madeline.

First off, to set the stage, I was ravenous after just completing a long run. Sunday morning post-run breakfast for me is more like an attack by a wild animal than typical human dining. So apologies to the staff if I left a mess ;)

The omelette arrived and immediately it appeared different than what I’m used to. The egg was delicately folded - more like the dough of a croissant than the typical globular mess of most omelettes. There was a generous portion of the ingredients atop the whole thing and more within. The sausage was absolutely perfect. Full flavored and moist but not the typical acrid assault on the taste buds from cheap breakfast sausage. The goat cheese was perfectly tart and prolifically distributed. Add in spinach and onions, and this was one delightfully flavorful (and filling) meal.

The coffee was also excellent. My girlfriend had a delicious oatmeal bowl that I envied in silence.

Why 4 and not 5 stars? I reserve 5 stars for mind blowing experiences. This was very good and highly recommended. But it’s not in my top three favorite breakfast places, and I have to draw the line somewhere.</text><Response>None</Response>< pics>

Petite Madeline is perfect for so many reason, and as an Oceanside native it has been nice to see this place bring charm to downtown. Whether you need a fresh baguette for dinner, pastries for the office meeting, or a place to delight out of town visitors, they have you covered! If that is not enough of a draw, their wedding cakes are divine, and make the testing and ordering process so easy for a bride! My husband and I are still talking about the cake and we got married in February. Top noch!<//Text>

When someone orders almond milk most of the time it's because of allergy or food aversion. If somebody orders and almond milk in anything make sure you do not put cow's milk!!! Totally made me sick on my last morning in Oceanside. They seem to have gotten flustered bye two of us and a group of four that walked in moments apart that was when the mistake was made. It seemed to me that they should be very clear on these kinds of things when speaking to each other. This was a huge deal and totally ruined my entire day.<//text>

<Review>Don't get their strange specials because they are designed to be strange rather than delicious. The food isn't very exciting. Besides the weird specialty of the day, it's generally only expected breakfast items. They don't have Madeleines to order. I was hoping for a more French experience. The location is good, but there's a crepe place across the street that delivers French cuisine and attitude way better than this place.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Petit Madeline is super comfy, never too loud, and has always had excellent service. Their coffee and tea are tasty and reasonably priced. They also have a huge array of creative pastries and mini cheesecakes, and a light lunch selection. There's lots of seating so it's a great place to meet family, have a study group, or just relax with a book.</Text>

The pastries are bland and not authentic, if that's what you're searching for. I was on the hunt for some decent crepes, croissants and pastries and did not find that here. Rather disappointed in the food, not sure what the hype is about here. Not too bad of sandwiches, but for a place that advertises itself as 'French' I was hoping for a bit more of a selection and authenticity.< /text>

I've been there before and gave 5 stars.
The breakfast sandwich today was a little skimpy and greasy. It's out of the way for me to go there, but my friends and I make a point to go there when we're near there.<//text>

Best Coffee and Breakfast with a Bakery to die for in Oceanside CA. Mayra & Ali are so good. As you enter you receive a big smile and a good morning. This is a normal greeting for most coffee shops and restaurants, but you will see that huge smile and know the greeting is real and meaningful. Be ready for your mouth to water and your taste buds to go to the moon with fantastic quality products.<//text>

wow,  I am European and always seek places with great pastries.  I have traveled all over the US and this is by far the best pastry shop I have ever visited.  does not look great inside,  the decor needs tweaking,  but the cheese Danish,  the pecan twist and ham and cheese are spectacular.  wow!< /text>

I've been here for breakfast about 6 times. Keep trying because I really want to love this place, but food and service is very inconsistent.  Every time it's a different issue.  Yesterday, my crepe order sat on the counter about 5 minutes waiting to be brought over.  Meanwhile, my friend had her meal way ahead of me.  The specialty coffees are served just lukewarm,  so must ask to have them served hot.  The regular menu items are generally very good, but the board special item just wasn't good for either person in our group who ordered it.  The best deal is if you're just going to buy counter bakery items, or if you're lucky in the dining room.< /text>

My family and I went there June 18 for Father's Day breakfast, the manager shows up with my food with ice cold hash browns, she took it back and came back with another cold hash browns, the second time I let it go, then she brought my wife's plate but unfortunately she didn't like the food and asked the manager if she can order something else, the manager takes the food away, which was untouched, and brings her a different dish but still hands me an additional bill for it. I said you can't have it both ways, you can't take the plate away and still charge me for, in that case I told her to bring it back and I'll take it home for the kids. The so called manager calls my wife cheap and walks away. All decent restaurants will gladly accommodate you if you're not happy with the meal, not this place. For a lousy plate of food they not only lost our long time patronage but our friends as well. I hope the owner Chef Christina would realize what kind of a person is managing her place.< /Text>

<Review>My favorite place to eat in Oceanside. The dessert counter has little fancy pieces of heaven. Hands down the chocolate pyramid is my favorite. The unexpected treat is their bagels. I've never had a bagel that was similar, they almost remind me of a croissant. Please check this place out if you haven't already!<//Review>< Pics>

This is a cozy little spot in the downtown area of Oceanside. We came here because the place across the street was super busy. For a small little bakery, they were able to accommodate 10 of us in under 10 minutes. Grant it, we were a little tight and really close to our neighboring table, but we were starving so we didn't mind.

The staff here is super friendly and served us very quickly. I ordered a "Mocha de Mexico w/peanuts" which tasted like a hot chocolate with a hint of a peanut flavor. It was decent, but I wish it would have came served a little hotter. The temperature wasn't very hot. I also ordered their two egg breakfast, with wheat toast and homefried potatoes. Their potatoes were delicious! The rest of the breakfast was good too, but the crepes were the hit at the table.

I'm glad we diverted from the place across the street and came here. We were very satisfied with the service and tasty food made from scratch!

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Surprisingly, despite being downtown and across the street from the theater and city hall, there aren't many people that go in. The place is quaint, the food is great-- not just the taste but the presentation. They have a selection of desserts and serve both breakfast and lunch (until 3 pm). They make everything from scratch so if you don't mind waiting you won't be disappointed.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Creating great cuisine from scratch using Traditional Techniques and fresh ingredients is the goal of many Chefs.

Achieving it though takes more than dedication, it takes skill, knowledge, and an unwavering commitment to the philosophy of “the right way, every time”.  Throw in the fact that you then want to apply it to producing both savory cuisine as well as baked goods and pastry and things get a whole lot harder. Very few can pull that off, Chef Christine Loyola is a Chef who can.

Great food made from scratch with a great staff and Chef.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Surprisingly, despite being downtown and across the street from the theater and city hall, there aren't many people that go in. The place is quaint, the food is great-- not just the taste but the presentation. They have a selection of desserts and serve both breakfast and lunch (until 3 pm). They make everything from scratch so if you don't mind waiting you won't be disappointed.<//Review>

Man, the food here is great, but they were understaffed or something because the place was a madhouse and the 3 people working there were running around like crazy trying to serve people<//text>

< review>
This is a cozy little spot in the downtown area of Oceanside. We came here because the place across the street was super busy. For a small little bakery, they were able to accommodate 10 of us in under 10 minutes. Grant it, we were a little tight and really close to our neighboring table, but we were starving so we didn't mind.

The staff here is super friendly and served us very quickly. I ordered a "Mocha de Mexico w/peanuts" which tasted like a hot chocolate with a hint of a peanut flavor. It was decent, but I wish it would have came served a little hotter. The temperature wasn't very hot. I also ordered their two egg breakfast, with wheat toast and homefried potatoes. Their potatoes were delicious! The rest of the breakfast was good too, but the crepes were the hit at the table.

I'm glad we diverted from the place across the street and came here. We were very satisfied with the service and tasty food made from scratch!

(Breakfast served from 7am-3pm)<//review>

Wow, terrific pasteries. $$. Good coffees. I'd have given them 5 stars, except their half & half creamer really needed cleaning in the afternoon & and the barrista seemed uninterested. Perhaps he's a purist -- dairy in coffee -- ugh. My sons would agree with him.< /Text>

Outstanding bakery. Coffee could be a tad stronger but I like it thick. This is a destination for us every time we are in Oceanside & will go out of our way to drop in.< /text>

I have come here several times for coffee and a pastry to go. Their coffee is good, they have lots of variety of baked goods and their prices are reasonable. For mother's day, all I wanted to do was finally go here for breakfast and it was such a disappointment. We had to pay for our food and tip before we got any food or service which was different but I tipped 18% assuming their service would be as good as their coffee. Food came relatively fast but they didn't make my husband's pancakes so we had to wait close to 10 minutes for those and my omlette had ham instead of sausage. Not to mention, my entire plate had a THICK layer of oil. My home fries weren't great and I choked through half my omlette that was literally dripping with oil because I had already paid $65 for our food and didn't want to waste it. My husband just got pancakes, hashbrowns and bacon and his was somehow covered in oil too. We are now home and both have stomach aches and regret. Service was dumpy to say the least. I never got a refill on my coffee and had to flag down people for our forgotten food. We were checked on once as we were about to leave but didn't have a set server, it was kinda whoever was around I guess. So sad because I loved this place as a nice coffee stop but I'm never going back.</text>

< Review>
Fantastic French cafe with crafty desserts. Greeted with fantastic service from Dan and the register. I ordered 2 delectible bacon egg and cheese croisants. Amazing buttery croissant with flakey outside and buttery soft inside. Bacon was crispy and cheese was just sharp enough to taste without being over bearing. Eggs were fresh and fluffy.</Review>

Food was simply delicious, tea was freshly made, view of the street was nice, however, I expected much more of a selection of pastries.</Review>

delicious food & excellent service that truly qualifies as hospitality in an environment that somehow manages to be cute/cozy & hip at the same time- I'd consider making a special trip down from out of town to drop by for their Malloricas or brioche of the day.< /Review>

<Text>I came here yesterday with 4 of my besties for our monthly GF lunch/ catch up date.  What a delicious experience.  The salmon eggs benedict was  a gourmet treat! Heaven on a plate.  Fresh made 1'thick toast,smoked salmon,egg and perfectly home made bernaise!  A few bites in, i had to stop and declare to the ladies how perfect this  dish was in its entirety!  My lady friends also loved the chicken greek salad, chicken nicious salad, and brisket baquette sandwich combo.
Passion fruit Ice Tea was on point.
It is a must return visit to this Gem spot in downtown Oceanside.<//Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) Spinach cheese croissants, alligators, etc... It's really good. Unconditionally recommended if you eat bread at Oceanside.

(Original)
시금치 치즈 크로와상, 엘리게이터 등... 정말 괜찮습니다. 오션사이드에서 빵을 먹는다면 무조건 추천.</review>
