My mom, myself and my service dog had a great first visit with Dr. Mofid. I like how Dr. Mofid wanted to get involved with my other doctors to try and find out what I have been living with that has made me so disabling ill. She also gave my mom some medicine to see if it can help her. Dr. Mofid had a great visit with Chloe my service dog . Her staff super kind and her office is so calming and relaxing. #TheSecretLifeofHiddenDisabilities #TheHaylieghProject</Review>

<date>1605896092944< /date><Rate>5</Rate><Text>My husband went into the office and saw her NP Juan R.Kojima  I would just like to say he is awesome.  We both found him to be very, very thorough he was able to find a spot on my husband's back that he felt was concerning to him that neither one of us was aware of.  He ordered a biopsy on a few areas and yes the spot was cancerous unfortunately.  We set up a appointment went back in and yes he was able to get it all out. Juan,  showed much compassion and was able to check on my husband every other day to see how he was healing.  We commend him for his good effort and caring enough for his patients. I would definitely recommend this doctor's office and the doctors here  they are very caring very nice people even the staff is great  always offering you water or coffee to make sure your visit is comfortable.  I was also amazed with how lovely the office is that alone is exciting.  My husband and I both are glad we chose this office and will  definitely recommend it to our friends and anyone one else that is looking for dermatologist. I again would just like to say Thanks 😊

She was great and recommend me to schedule another visit to remove a cyst on my stomach area that I thought was an ingrown hair. I was really nervous about it, until I met Juan Kojima PA-C, if I could give him 10 stars for this review, I would. Juan was AMAZING!! Very knowledgeable and made the whole procedure easy and pain free, that's right, I didn't feel anything, even when he was stitching my belly! He also was very careful in giving me the perfect instructions how to take care about it.  Also I would like to thank the gals at the front desk, helping me communicate with Dr. Mofid regarding a cream that was prescribed to me by the other physician that end up giving me a bad allergy reaction. They were very efficient calling the Dr. and my pharmacy to get the right medication for my face. Another thing to mention, great office decoration too!! All the crystals around definitely make this place very welcoming!!!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Dr. Mona is by far the best dermatologist I have ever seen. I have seen many great and qualified Doctors; however, none of whom come close to Dr. Mona.  Not only has she gone out of her way to see me, but she has never once made me feel rushed (even when squeezing me in between patients on a busy day).

My visits to the office are top-notch from start to finish.  When meeting with Dr. Mona, I do not feel like I am at a Doctor's office.  Instead, I feel comfortable and at ease, as if I am meeting with a long time friend.  She listens to my concerns and treats them.  She is always willing to give alternative remedies rather than prescription drugs if I am hesitant.

Dr. Mona is not just brilliant and qualified, but a kindhearted, caring, and beautiful person inside and out.  I think so highly of her that I recommend my own family to come to her (even as an out-of-network doctor!).<//review>

I have been a patient of Mona Mofid's for 7 years. Her staff is excellent, very professional and kind. Dr. Mona is nothing short of exceptional. She is by far the best dermatologist I have ever been to,  and I have been to several. Her knowledge and ability make her probably the best in California and I am confident she would rank really high out of all the Dermatologists in America.<//text>

Dr. Mona is impressive; and I'm not only speaking of her expertise, but of her spirit as well. She is the most genuinely caring, humble and compassionate physician I have ever met (and I’ve seen a variety of doctors).  If you’re looking for the best Dermatologist, you’ve found her.  Dr. Mona’s staff also makes you feel welcomed immediately upon your arrival.  To me, it demonstrates how much Dr. Mona cares about her patients that she wants to ensure an overall pleasing experience.  Trust me, you’ll be doing yourself a favor by bringing your concerns to Dr. Mona!< /review>

Dr Mona Mofid is by far my favorite dermatologist, and I have seen so many over the years. She's not pushy for expensive treatments (other dermatologists have been). She has a kind, cheerful manner as a doctor, and works closely with her patients. She has always ran on time. Her office is immaculately clean.

Be prepared to arrive early to find parking, as parking is often limited.< /Text>

Dr. Mona, her support staff and office are incredible. You immediately feel comfortable walking in her office, it’s not only beautiful, but it has a sense of calm. Her staff clearly explains everything you need to know before your appointment, but in a way that is less clinical and more caring. Dr. Mona is incredibly through, and genuinely caring, and maybe most of all equal parts knowledgeable and capable, in other words an expert in her field. Besides a great experience at your appointment, she will also make sure you know exactly what to do to care for your skin or personal condition.

As an athlete, runner, cyclist, avid motorcycle rider out in the California sun all the time, I left my appointment feeling like I knew what I had been lacking in caring for my skin as I age, and how to actively prevent further damage (or accelerating the damage). If you need to see a dermatologist, Dr. Mona should be your first choice, there is a reason she has all these amazing reviews, she deserves them and is just that good.</Text>

Dr. Mona Mofid (Dr. Mona as she is affectionately referred to) is a doctor among all doctors. And I am not joking. As somebody who has lived with countless auto-immune diseases over the past 20 years, I have lost count of the number of doctors I have gone to. Visiting Dr. Mona transcends the “doctor” experience. To start with, her office feels like you have walked into a spa. So calm. So peaceful. So tastefully decorated. No matter the level of pain a patient is feeling (and I could barely walk when I first visited her), the environment instills a sense of inner tranquility and ease. As for human contact, her staff is exceptional. The receptionists don’t just “check you in”. They engage you with warm smiles and friendly, informative conversation in preparation for your visit with the doctor. Then there is Dr. Mona Mofid. I have never encountered a smarter, more compassionate, more creative, more ‘human’ doctor in my entire life. Dr Mona is the embodiment of the medical trifecta: heart, soul, and smarts. I had been living with an excruciating condition for more than 15 years as a result of cancer related treatment. Over that period of time, I had seen more than a dozen doctors in a desperate attempt to find some relief. Doctor after doctor came up empty handed. In less than 15 minutes, Dr. Mona came up with a creative gameplan that has literally changed my life. I cried tears of gratitude on my follow up visit. Is she a miracle worker??? From my experience, I’d say absolutely! Although I am not alone. If you do some research, you will find out that Dr. Mona has been voted “best of” year after year after year. And for good reason. Some people in life are fortunate enough to have embraced their true calling. In Dr. Mona’s case, her patients are the lucky beneficiaries of her God-given gifts.<//Text>

This is a review of their phone system and callback service. I could not get through to a live person, the automated phone system kept sending me in a loop. Left a voicemail. They called back the next day only one time and did not even leave a message? I was busy at the time and couldn't take the call.

Hands down the sweetest, smartest, most elegant and eloquent physician I've ever met! Clearly her credentials speak for themselves as do her awards for compassion and being voted Best Dermatologist in San Diego! I'm s nurse and all the nurses go to see her... That's usually how you know who the best docs in town are! Who the nurses go to!< /Review>

Best dermatologist EVER.  She has an awesome "chairside" manner.  The office staff is friendly, and the office itself provides such a peaceful feeling.  Dr. Mona is so warm and always has a minute for a chat.  I've been going to her for a while and she always takes excellent care of me.  When she has to "fry" something on my skin she always distracts from the pain by telling an interesting story or just getting me to talk.  She's great!< /text>

Dr. Mona Mofid has has a rare quality few people have. Dr. Mofid is kind, compassionate, has a loving personally and is truly a beautiful person. She is professional, extremely knowledgable, answers all your questions, she really listens to your concerns and cares for your well being. You will not be just a number here. From the moment you step into Dr. Mofid's office you will feel peace and tranquility with the beautiful surroundings and peaceful music. You will be greeted warmly by her staff who are always smiling, helpful, and kind . The fact that Dr. Mona Mofid went to John Hopkins Medical School is equally impressive. If a problem arises go see Dr. Mona Mofid. You will be glad you did!< /Review>

Wow! The minute I walked in the office I was impressed! The office is beautiful. A very friendly receptionist greeted me and signed me in. I was sent to exam room. Right when Dr. Mona Mofid walked in she was smiling and upbeat. She introduced herself. She asked me about myself and was truly interested. She did a  skin checkup head to toe. The best doctor I've been to. I highly recommend Dr. Mona Mofid!<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Growing up on the beaches of San Diego, I regularly tanned with cocoa butter and never even thought of wearing sunscreen.  The many years of "skin abuse" caught up to me.  Fortunately Dr. Mona identified several precancerous lesions on my skin and froze them away.  Who knows how badly they might have become.

I now know the importance of sunscreen and get my "aging spots" checked regularly  -especially as I get older.  I also discovered that skin cancer is actually the number one cancer.  These annual visits are cheap insurance and Dr. Mona is the best.<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>So happy I was referred to Dr. Mofid by my primary physician. Dr. Mofid has really made a difference in my skin since I started going to her. I can't remember the last time my skin was this clear or the last time I was happy with how my skin appeared. I am still in the process of treatment with her, so I can't even imagine how my skin will look further down the road. To add to this, she is extremely caring and professional. You can tell she really cares about her patients. No wonder she is the best in San Diego!! Definitely recommend Dr. Mona Mofid if you are looking for a reliable dermatologist.<//text><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc072bd2b438eb:0x633b9de30ef2f565</Gmap_id><Date>1470778337335<//Date>< pictures>

<Review>Dr. Mofid ( Mona ) was one of the best dermatologists that I have yet to see ; she was an awesome conversationalist  and by the time that my appointment was completed, I was not only treated for my dermatology problems - I left her office with a much better knowledge of my issues with melanoma ( skin cancer ).
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and it is on the rise because of the effects of global warming ; it is partially caused by the large amount of uncontrolled tons of CO2
that is relased into our atmosphere every day by the very products of our own existence - including noxious factory gas   emissions and chloroflorohydrocarbons (aerosol
cans) ,etc.- which are destroying "our protective  ozone layer" that protect us from our Sun's harmful UVA and UVB rays.
The rates of skin cancer - melanoma - and other environmentally acquired illnesses are rapidly rising in regions worldwide; the UV index has surpassed 11 in many areas - even in the southwestern USA -  and it is now necessary to check yourself for signs of keratoses if you spend a lot of time outdoors; even in the mountains where the air is thinner and exposure is easier.
Melanoma is one of the deadliest forms of cancer: The signs to watch for are a change in the colour, size, or shape of a mole or a darker skin area that feels scaly or rough to the touch; an area that seems painful or may itch or bleed when rubbed.
It is more common in light skinned people however,people with skin of colour are susceptible too, as it can be found on the palms of the hands, under nails or under the feet; even in the mouth.
It was easily treatable with a small device that my dermatologist used to "freeze it off" - the temperature is below 300°F and it hurts like a bee sting for about a few minutes; then it falls off within a couple of weeks.
I highly recommend that those of you who spend a great amount of you time outdoors, do a "self-examination" every month or so and wear a broad spectrum sunscreen that is water resistant, which has an SPF - Sun Protection Factor - of at least 30 or greater.
Make an appointment to see Dr. Mofid, if you think that you may have found any signs of what you may think is an unusual growth on your skin and don't forget that cloudy days have little effect on the Sun's power.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dc072bd2b438eb:0x633b9de30ef2f565< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>I met Mona Mofid, MD when I was 37 about 8 years ago.  My primary care physician with Sharp Medical Group referred me to her to treat an area on my nose.  This area on my nose made me feel so ugly.  Not to mention, my skin was (leather like) that of a typical 37 year old in SoCal that had too much sun exposure and not enough hats and sunscreen.  Not only did Mona treat the area on my nose she provided me with advice, products and treatments (over an 8 year period and still today) that reversed the aging clock for me by years.  Some of my friends would say decades.  For me, I don’t feel the need to wear makeup... just a little sunscreen.  Also, I use to cover parts of my face with hair (bangs etc.).  Now I pull my hair back as I am very proud of how my face looks.  I owe all of this to Mona.  She is so knowledgeable and truly cares about you.  Just last month, I saw Mona for a few areas on my arm (that’s it).  Next thing I know I am in a robe and she is checking my entire body.  This is just one example of how thorough she is.  I must not forget Mona’s office staffs, Sarah and Aby, who are very helpful and welcoming.  Lastly, her office has to be the most beautiful office I have ever seen.  I would highly recommend seeing Mona Mofid, MD for any skin issue.  She changed my life.

Dr. Mona Mofid is amazing! I have a rare and hard to treat skin condition, Granuloma annulare. It had become very aggressive and visible. I was becoming panicked about it.  Her staff was very understanding and got me an emergency appointment right away. I have been treated by many dermatologists for Granuloma annulare over the years and it rarely ever worked, the treatments that did work had many other health risks. Dr. Mofid is the first Doctor to get my skin condition under control without the really dangerous medicines. She always spent plenty of time with me, even in my initial appointment that was "squeezed" in. I would highly recommend her. She knows what she's doing, very caring, and really wants to help her patients. She was almost as happy as I was to see that my treatments were working. I love Dr. Mofid!</text>

Quick height with a beautiful view. Closer to the top there are rocky paths where it's easy to slip and fall. This is not a good hike for small children under 6, people with health conditions or very senior.<//text>

Eagle Rock Trail is a short hike with beautiful view of the Lake Tahoe. The trail is easy to hike just be careful. There are multiple points to see the lake and take pictures.< /Review>

A short, dusty, steep hike to a great view. Little kids (and mother-in-laws) can totally handle this, but it is steep, so keep that in mind. Gorgeous views of the lake. Rocks are sharp, so be careful. Go in the morning when it's cool. Back your car in if you can; pulling out onto the road can be tricky. Parking area can fill up quick, too, so get there early. Overall a decent family hike. Go in matching outfits and take your holiday card picture!< /Text>

Eagle Rock is my absolute favorite place in all of the west shore. Such a wonderful view.  We like to pack a lunch and just hang out up here for a few hours eating and chatting in the breeze.< /review>

Short hike for great views. Family and pet friendly but look out for a few slippery spots. Once at the top the views are amazing. There isn’t any shelter so if it’s windy be careful.</Text>

< Review>
Super easy hike up to a full West shore panoramic view of the lake. From car to view it can't be more than 15 minutes. Saw people in their 80s and a bride in her wedding dress. If you want the hike view without the hike, this is for you.< /Review>

<text>I've searched far and wide for the best cobb salad. This one is the gold standard of cobbs, a delicious monster. Paired with a neat Templeton Rye which came in a generous pour. The bar staff was attentive and courteous.  Barstools are wonky in a good way.  Cell reception was dismal, and the guest wifi was full / unable to connect the whole time. Forces you to converse with people around you rather than having your head in your phone, but I had to walk up the hill a bit to order an uber (Verizon).</text>< userid>

<review>Cool theme in my opinion for a bar/pub experience, however if you don’t like the cluttered accessory theme-type of venues, it may not be for you.  And they’ve got more tv’s than God, I imagine, so come zone out if you’re by yourself some time.
The food was decent however the menu is relatively difficult/annoying to read (aesthetically) because of the colored-paper and dull design (font) and a newspaper style menu.  A little design-psychology would help that problem, pretty easy fix, but who knows, maybe the chaos-menu is a thing now.

Host was nice and helpful, and the first bartender was great however the second bartender was a downer.  Our waitress left us abandon, the food was late and incorrect, and management never came by.  Thankfully a busboy eventually made it within yelling distance or we would have had a parking ticket.

Parking is a bit of a long winded process because of the parking lot (paid parking in a huge lot garage) so be prepared to stay a while, especially with this lousy service from staff and non-existent management.

No thanks Beanery!<//review></record></dataset><record>

Had a great time here with some of the locals for the 49ers vs Green Bay game. The 1920 gin drink was awesome as recommended by the lovely bartender Allie. The chicken club sandwich was huge and hit the spot. Very unique place in Redondo Beach Pier. The barstools were like trucker seats on springs, never seen that before. Definitely will be back.<//review>

<text>It's a good spot to watch football on Sunday's or any sport for that matter Tv's everywhere. It also has pretty cool views of the Pier from wherever you sit.
The Mamas Nachos weren't bad, their are actually better than the last we've had in a couple of places recently to be honest. Good amount of cheese, the meat wasn't dry, so we liked them.
I wouldn't mind coming back here to check out more things of the menu.< /text>< name>

This place has the biggest selection of hot dogs I've ever seen. It was very reasonably priced, especially considering how much came with the actual hot dog.

The decor was nothing special-definitely felt a little lackluster. But you don't come here for atmosphere. This place is perfect hangover food.</Review></record>

I had a couple meals here. The view of the beach is amazing. The menu is pretty extensive though so I recommend looking it up before you go to save yourself some hassle. But the food was great and they serve breakfast all day! Bar was cute and had pretty good happy hour deals on margaritas. Would go again.<//Review>

Grabbed a 🍺 at the bar. Draft menu was extensive... Especially the IPA 🍺.

Unfortunately, they ran out of my top 4. But overall, good place to grab a 🍺 and watch sports on their big screens.</review>

I enjoy the queso and chili appetizer--could eat that by the bucket! My favorite time to come is in the winter--way smaller crowds, and you can always get one of the good seats overlooking the ocean. Order a cocktail and post up with some munchies--what's not to like? Sometimes in my experience they have some service-related issues, but nothing severe. I've also noticed a lot of the time they are out of items on their cocktail/beer menus. Being better about denoting what's currently in stock would be beneficial.< /text>< response>

Interesting theme all throughout the restaurant that you don't realize the time going by as you're waiting for your food because you're pulled in by all of your surroundings and table top.

Hostesses are welcoming.

Large selection of food to choose from (Breakfast - Lunch - Dinner - Desert) that is made to look like it was printed on a newspaper format.

Food came out fast & was delicious.

Overall, I like the design, food, staff, tv's, beer ^_^. If it were up to only those categories, It would have been a 5 star rating.

So, why did I give a 2 -star rating?

The only reason I gave this place such a low rating, even though I found most of it to be satisfying, I looked up above our table after we got done eating and I noticed that they don't clean as often as they should.

The back of their TVs had a thick layer of dust and you can see some of the dust getting blown by the breeze coming in the patio doors and that breeze comes straight from the ocean so it comes with some good pressure. You follow the wooden structure of the building and dust dust dust dust dust dust dust. No doubt in my mind that everyone who eats here eats with dust sprinkling down on their plate the entire time. Water with dust, nice.

In my opinion, get your employees to start cleaning the damn place or management....do it yourself cause it's clear that nobody really cares about the cleanliness and it doesn't fall back on anybody else but management.

Get it together because that filth will only become more and more noticeable.</Review>

<Review>Quirky combo beach/sports/Americana/dive bar rolled into one. The bar forgos the usual bar stools for car captains chairs on big coil springs. Made for a comfortable, laid back (literally,) bar experience.

Great beer list of mostly local or near local beers, mostly favoring the IPA stole which suited me but the selection was good so don't let that dissuade you if you don't like IPAs. Burger was a solid bar burger and good side selections. Menu was pretty extensive so most should be able to find something to their liking.

Great place and I'll be back!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Horrible do not go to this location
Food is Horrible and the manager doesnt even acknowledge the multiple food mistakes. Brings out raw pizza and chili to have them sent back the be supposively remade to come back out even worse and still cold. And wait staff can only smile
Go to Burger King will be better</Text>

<text>It took over an hour to get our food and it wasn't even very busy. After receiving our food several of us got burgers, don't order their Barney's burger the burger patties are tiny like they belong on a slider not a full sized burger. Another one of us got the DBL and the patties were 3x the size of the Barney's burger. They assured us that was correct and the way the burgers were ment to be both double Patty's but completely different sized meat Patty's.<//text>< pics>

I don't know how they top the view, but the fantastic beer selection, friendly service and funky decor make it a great place to have a few beers and relax.  Outside deck.  Food was very good as well.  Tacos al Pastor were great.  They also have a pool table and a few large screen tvs for catching the games.  Really great bar.</Text>

<Review>I cannot believe I haven't been here before - such a cool place! The music sets the mood of having a laid-back, alternative vibe. I love the bar stools being on springs so that you can lean all the way back if you wanted to. And for being right on the beach, it's especially impressive how they keep the place clean. The workers and people who go there are cool and it's just a nice place to be. They have a pool table, Pacman machine, and a shuffleboard area. Can't wait to go back there!</Review><pics>None< /pics></record>

<Review>The last couple visits have been very disappointing. Although the location is amazing, the service and the food have a lot of room for improvement. We recently stopped in for lunch - ordered the kids pizza and the nachos with carne asada- Both dishes were really bad, tasted horrible and we couldn’t eat. It’s too bad because we used to love going there, but things have changed and I don’t think we will go back.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

There was a pretty long wait for the dinner rush. It was worth it in the end. Their appetizers were really impressive. They have a really wide selection of food. I can't wait til next time!</Review>

<text>Never knew it was such a great sports bar and eatery! Breakfast is served all day, which really helps, and there's something on the menu for everyone. Multiple Tv's to watch no matter where you sit! Great views onto ocean, which you never get in sports bar settings, and that really helps for non-sports fans with you...< /text>< date>

< review>
So they get 2 stars because the food was good, and they have a good bar selection. However, it took 15 minutes for the waitress to come by, only after we asked the hostess to get her. Our food came out, they forgot the extra cheese my wife asked for her burger (and we had to ask 3 times from 2 separate people to get it). I asked for a chili sourdough bread bowl, and was brought a cup of chili, I also never received my salad that came with it. Our food arrived before my beer, and my wife's cocktail never showed up, until we asked the food runner, who explained they missed it, and then our waitress, after another 10 minutes. My wife finally got her drink 45 minutes after originally ordered, and we had already finished our food. It seems like a good place, and maybe we just had a bad experience. Really bad.</review>

< Review>
I love the views here. We came in pre fathers day sat but called 1st to see if there was a wait for brunch, per employee no just walk in ,no wait for patio. The entire section on patio was reserved except for 2 tables. We brought our dogs knowing there is no issue for the patio and were told by the server that they were understaffed and they would not seat us although there was 6 people in the main restaurant... I spoke to manager who said he would seat us an one of the reserved tables immediately. I was't trying to cause trouble just looking for affordable food with dogs and a baby to sit outside. Aside from that little snag, the rest of our experience was great. I've been going her since they opened. Ocean views and cocktails with a large menu what more could you ask for. WE love the chili, burgers, pizza and the hoagies. Huge selection of draft beer that is ice. The decor in the place is fun to look at. After 11 on sat not sure about sunday they have a great local musician that play the ukulele, it is a nice way to spend kick off your weekend. if you are a redondo beach local don't forget to ask for the 10% local discount! cheers<//Review>

I think there is A LOT of work to be done here.  I yelped a long review on it and have to say almost all the reviews are like mine.  I think it would be a good idea for the management to read the Yelp reviews or this restaurant will go south.  I really like the vibe and decor but the staff and food will NOT keep this restaurant in business.  Just my opinion.< /Text>

The view, the vibe and newspaper menu is the most well rounded on the pier. Great for all ages. Awesome during football season.< /review>

Great place to sit and relax after a long walk on the beach. Also great service I never have to wait. But the only thing that bothers me is when dishes are dropped in the bucket. Love this place otherwise</Text>

Came here for brunch with some friends. Good food selection although the chilaquiles were soggy and there was something off about the flavor. I give this place 4 stars because of the view and the full bar.<//review>

I realize it's the day after Christmas, but if I'm paying you to serve me, please in the very least, fake a smile. My very first time at this establishment and I surely will not be back. The server literally rolled her eyes when I asked for salsa and napkins. The napkins never came, the salsa came after I'd finished eating. Thankfully, we had cash to pay the bill because after she threw our bill on the table, we never saw her again.(We waited 10 minutes because we were originally going to pay with a card.)<//Text>

Service here is the worst.

Night started with the hostess telling us we're 4th in line. We were waiting nearly 20 minutes. Then suddenly my fiancee noticed the hostess beginning to pack up the hostess stand.  If my fiancee didn't notice and ask me what is going on i would have not even asked.  we would have been standing there, ignored.   She told us the place is turning to open seating and to go find ourselves a seat, I asked her why she didnt tell us, she told us its not her job, her shift ended.   Have some common courtesy, we were your customers before your shift ended.

Then we found ourself a seat.  The waitress seemed nice at first.  Then our beers took 15 minutes to come out,  our appetizers were literally served WITH our dinner.  As if we ordered pretzel sticks with our meal as a side or something?  Finally,  we were completely ignored. most of the night.  Waitress never brought us salad dressing. Then she also let us sit there for an hour longer, never cleaning our table once.  we even ordered another beer AFTER her asking us if we wanted boxes. Instead, never cleaned our table.  The manager even was sitting on the other side in a booth, folding silverware. Never said a word.   I dont think i'll be eating here again. Left my fiancee with a bad stomach ache too.  I bet their kitchen is taken car of just as bad.

Oh and the food quality. NOT WORTH IT.  simple. not special.  not much flavor.  waste. its bar food.</Review>

Location is amazing, right on the beach. Food was hit or miss, some was good, others just ok. The sampler appetizer was pretty ok, other than the fried chicken planks, those were tasteless. The breakfast was really good though, pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage were all lovely. Others at the table had normal dinners. All agreed the macaroni and cheese was lousy.<//Review>

I like this place and their menu! Food is hit or miss. Sometimes it’s great and others it’s just average.< /review>

Came in during brunch. We walked in to sit ourselfs. There was several groups on many tables as well as the bar. After 10 minutes or more of waiting we decide to walk up to the bar to ask for menus since he had not yet been attended. The server who was near the bar that we asked for menus was rude saying she will take us menus soon. Few minutes passed by and she finally came to our table and just threw the menus at us and kept on walking not even greeting us or asking what do we want to drink or anything. Another 10 minutes passed and she still had not come by.

We got up and left and unfortunately from this experience we do not plan to come again.<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Dead dead stranded here after the flight. Great beer and good atmosphere. The served appetizer platter was oléolé. We completely failed the pub quiz ... didn't know that the German alphabet had 30 letters ... just: "Äääääh, öööööh, üüüüüh, ..."

Haven't been here in years since there are so many pho place to go to.  The decor certainly is a big improvement from many years ago, bright, open, pleasant!  The staff, though, needed to smile a bit to match the decor.  The soup base was reasonably good, tasty and flavorful.  The meats and noodles were average.  They sell drinks also which I didn't try.< /review>

Ordered online and didn't get the 10% off.  They ran out the black grass jelly topping and couldn't refund the money.  Had to pick something else.</text>

A good alternative to other Taiwanese tea places. Jazen has unique flavors, and the add real bits of fruit like lychee on top of your other toppings. Our favourites are lychee green tea with aloe Vera and taro milk tea with honey Bob's (yum!). The popcorn chicken is also delicious. There is an attached pho place, a bonus if you are hungry.</Text>

<Review>Made an order through UberEats. There was a B1G1 offer, so I ordered two steak pho. But I only receive one steak pho. And the package is broken, so the soup is spilled out.

This was my first time to try the pho from here and this was the last time. If I want to try pho, I'll come to another store instead of this one.< /Review><time>1614665824483<//time><Gmap_id>0x808fb504a0cf0ce9:0xcf7f017410961b5e<//Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< username>

<review>This is not the usual pleasant Jazen tea chain store you’d expect. It’s within a pho restaurant. The saleswoman hardly spoke any English.

I ordered original milk tea with 25% sugar and no ice - got lots of ice, the drink couldn’t be sweeter, the boba tasted super old and starchy, the milk tea tasted nothing like normal milk tea, but like a weird combination of rice/cinnamon. Couldn’t put myself together to take a second sip, so threw the entire cup away.

Usually I’m not so picky on milk tea, but this one blew my mind how bad milk tea can taste like. Avoid at all cost.< /review>< Pictures>

Less oily, more flavor, and clean tasting. I have tasted some better and "more" authentic vietnamese pho, but this one is pretty good and is near my home.</text>< Pictures>

<text>I placed a To-Go Order over the phone, and where I do understand that there might be a language barrier in some cases, I would expect that there be a general understanding of the menu. Anyway, the employee had to get a manager to speak to me as she couldn't understand my placing an order of spring rolls and egg rolls. Then I walk into the establishment, where I see an employee a few steps back from the cashier, entirely engulfed in her phone and doesn't look up to acknowledge me whatsoever. I stand at the cash register staring at her, and looking around to see if maybe someone else is supposed to man the register, but no one comes around. I give this employee 4 whole minutes of time on her phone while I'm standing at the register in front of her until I gently clear my throat to see if that gets her attention. It doesn't, another minute passes and for some reason she decides to look up, and in a delayed manner says, "Oh". She walks up to the register, I tell her that the to go order wrapped up to the side should be mine, she attempts to ring me up but then goes in the back with my credit card several times. It is clear she has no clue how to ring me up, she finally calls another co-worker to help her, and he messes with the register for another 5 minutes without success. Then someone that I assume is the manager or at least a competent employee walks in the door, and is able to ring up my order. I believe I was in the restaurant for about 20 minutes to pick up a phoned in order from 40 minutes ago.

The upside is, the food was pretty decent.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fb504a0cf0ce9:0xcf7f017410961b5e< /gmapID></record>

I have only been here twice and have had bad experiences both times. The first time I came, none of the tables were cleaned even though it was nearly empty during the weekend, and so I had to wait while the tables were cleaned. Both times, the rolls and pho we ordered did not taste authentic, and so I will be going to other places more frequently.< /Review>

They seemed short staffed.  Easily overwheled when more customers showed up.  Not enough staff to bus the tables and take orders.  Pho soup base is saltier.  Popcorn Checked Bowl is good, but served in fast food grade plastic bowl.</Text>

The soup was neither particularly good nor bad, but the 'regular' portion would barely have been considered a 'small' in Seattle. It's okay in a pinch but it's not going to get you off and the value-for-dollar might leave you a little cold.

Pretty much zero chance I'll return considering there are family-run options close enough at hand.<//Review>

<Review>Probably the largest portion and healthiest boba drinks you can find, what with the real fruit bits. One of my favorite places to go to for boba drinks! That being said, sometimes the wait is a bit long and customer service can be improved, and you cannot customize anything like ice level, or sugar level, etc... I do like how it’s a part of a pho place!</Review>< user_id>

I have tried a lot of different Pho places, and this is by far the best Pho that I’ve ever tried in my life! I’m hooked on it! The broth is soooo flavorful, the meat and tendon and everything is so delicious. Also they serve milk tea and boba drinks here also. This is a really great place for Pho soup, I would recommend it to anyone. So flavorful, I can’t get over how good it is. When I crave Pho, I always come here for their un comparable  flavor 😍< /Text>

Simple Viet food. Vermicelli dishes are good, as well as the soups. Just make sure you check the ingredients of the soup before ordering. Some of the items are not for everyone (tripe, tendon, etc.).<//Review>

The original milk tea is not good at all. Tastes like rice milk and has hardly any sweetness, very odd flavor. I got original with regular sweetness and with honey boba and black tea. The 2nd star is because the customer service was nice, but the tea was so bad I had to give a review. Only tried the tea tho, no food.< /text>

Excellent service, good prices, and great Pho. There are many other dishes on the menu but frankly the pho is the signature item here and it is really the prime reason to come here. They also sell bubble teas. The place is normally busy but it's large so getting a seat is always quick. Service is always fast.<//review>

It's a nice stop when you have no where else to eat at 11pm.  The food quality isn't as bad as what people think but it definitely doesn't feel too sanitary there, eating out of the Pho Hoa bowl

I recently stopped by and found their prices were raised up to around $10+.  For pho?!

Service is horrible.  The worker look so irritated that we walked in.

Unless it's late and you can't find anywhere else to eat, go to other pho places.</Text>

Also known as Pho Hoa, this place has good Pho.  This place gets really busy at lunch time so it's hard to find a seat sometimes.  I recommend this place anytime anytime after 2 or whenever their happy hour is.< /review>

<text>Doesn't get more San Jose and drinking coffee in DUMBO. It's a little bit off the beaten path, but it's worth it if you want a specialty drink, to buy beans, or just to hang out at their many tables. The decor itself is worth the trip. Pro-tip: West Elm on Main has a San Jose Roasting inside of it if that's more convenient for you.<//text><pics>None</pics><username>Violet Robertson</username>< user>

I would give negative reviews to this place if I could. Their customer service is horrible––the manager especially (as of January 2019) is *extremely* incompetent.

So, here goes: The restaurant messed up on an order that I made through Uber Eats. Maybe an honest mistake––it happens. I ordered the Mango Mojito drink with boba (an extra topping), but upon receiving the order from the Uber delivery guy, I found that the boba was missing. Unhappy with my order––as any customer would be––I called the restaurant to ask what happened. The lady that answered the phone was considerate; she offered a discount or free drink I could redeem upon coming there in person. I wanted some sort of written guarantee for my purposes, maybe an email or something, so I inquired. She routed me to the manager, which completely flipped the script.

First, he claimed that the Mango Mojito did not come with extra toppings. He suggested this as an explanation for why I did not receive boba with the drink. This was peculiar since the form presented on the Uber Eats website *by the restaurant* presented a myriad of extra toppings, including boba. Further, I was charged for the boba, too, so minimally I should get a refund. Completely ignoring what I said, he blamed Uber for messing up the order to the restaurant. I could maybe understand that logic in some situations, but definitely not in this one. Here's why. The restaurant fulfilled my footnote requests for less ice and sugar in a second drink that I ordered, so surely they would have seen that I asked for boba in the first drink. I probed the manager again––I asked him, "if I came to the restaurant right now and asked for boba with the Mango Mojito, then you give it to me?" He said, "Yes, but it would cost extra."

YES! And this is exactly what I did through Uber Eats, so please explain to me how you *can't see* that I ordered boba for the first drink, but *can* see my footnotes for the second drink? On top of that, he started going off on how 60 cents isn't that much, Uber Eats sucks, Doordash is better, and the kicker––how the Uber Eats delivery driver is in charge of making sure my order is correct. Oh ok, let me get this straight. Now the Uber delivery driver––someone who merely transports food/drinks from point A to point B––is in charge of making sure everything that was supposed to be in my order was there? Yeah, it makes perfect sense for the delivery driver to start inspecting my drinks for boba, less ice, and less sugar. Because of the inconvenience, I asked for a discount or free drink, which was reasonable since that is something even his colleague had offered me before. He said he had no jurisdiction and I should take it up with Uber. What is Uber supposed to do? The restaurant messed up my order, not Uber. The manager even conceded that it was partly their fault, but he still refused to compensate me for the inconvenience.

I thanked him for his time because there was no point in arguing with someone so incredibly out-of-sync with business ethics. What happened to "the customer is always right"? Point being, don't go to this place. Cupertino has a ton of other better pho and boba places.<//text>

<text>This place has fantastic tees. And since it's part of Pho Hoa, you're able to load up on some pho, rolls and milk tea. You can't go wrong. My favorite tea is The Islander. Reminds me of Hawaii with every sip. Pair that with some fresh rolls and  Pho Tai and you have yourself a great meal.</text>< Response>

Decent, basic pho.  The Just Enough size (aka small) is just not enough, especially the meat.  The regular size has better portions of meat.  There's also a boba tea place, Jazen Tea, colocated here.  The regular Thai tea was a little too watered down.  There's some kind of happy hour from around 4-6 pm for their teas.<//Review>

It took over 20 minutes for my popcorn chicken to come out. I saw another server givr a table their popcorn chicken much earlier than my order. On top of that, their box was two times bigger than mine when there is only one option for popcorn chicken on the menu. Horrible service and discriminating portions sums up this restaurant.

< Review>
Any pho place that has the balls, tendon, tripod, and other goodies deserves a minimum of three stars. I like this place because it's clean, quick, and the soup is good. The soup kind of misses a bit of umami for me, but I'm happy I came here.<//Review>

It's fairly consistent in taste and quality, sometimes they don't give enough noodles. It's mediocre but it'll do if you're craving pho.</text>

Came here with a friend on opening night to try it out. It's located inside Pho Hoa.

Opted for the original milk tea with pearls, which was disappointing. Milk tea was okay, but the pearls were chewy and too tough. Drank about half and threw the rest out.

We asked two other people how their Tutti Frutti and Lychee Explosion drinks were. The girl said the Tutti Frutti was pretty good, but the guy suggested not ordering the Lychee.<//Text>

After speaking with the team at Cupertino, we can assure you that no one else has reported getting sick, and all of our fresh ingredients for the seafood pho were inspected carefully. So we sincerely believe that it wasn't directly from us, and unfortunately could be attributed to the flu that's been affecting so many. We're so sorry and we hope you feel better very soon.

I love a relaxing full body massage about every other Friday evening, Michael is my masseur of choice...he is amazing at releasing all of the built up stress and tension from my weekly activities, this is my favorite spot so far...I have visited multiple massage joints in the past, highly recommend.😁<//review>

Use the $5 saved as tip for the workers.  Me and the wife go here at least once a month.  Open area so if you're shy, get over it. ;-p<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<user_name>John Bott< /user_name><text>Everyone loves a good story especially if there is a happy ending. Our story is probably no different from other stories that begin with a challenge that had to be overcome and the path to overcoming that challenge. The challenge for my husband was his eyes were turning inward resulting in double vision, squinting to see things and his need to work exceptionally hard to watch programs on TV, play golf and do everyday things we take for granted.  Due to these problems his “quality of life” was greatly affected.  At age 72, a decrease in quality of life has an overall dramatic effect on all the things we do each day.

Our path led us to Dr. Shira Robbins, Ophthalmologist, with several specialties, including eye re-alignment disorders, to seek help for my husband’s double vision, squinting to see and the related fatigue.  After an extensive evaluation, she thoroughly explained my husband’s problems were related to his eye muscles not correctly aligning the position of each eye.   She provided treatment options, one of which was to have surgery, to correct the problem. He decided to have the surgery because of his feeling of confidence in Dr. Robbins and her team.

Our “happy ending” after the surgery my husband no longer has double vision, no need to squint to see things and the fatigue has been replaced with increased energy to enjoy life.

Thank you, Dr. Robbins for giving my husband a happier and better quality of life!

My husband and I encourage older adults to seek out help versus thinking nothing can be done to help your vision or blaming it on “getting older.” Your vision problems maybe similar or different from my husband’s vision problems. Let Dr. Robbins hear your story and hopefully you will learn more about your vision problems and find a path.

We wish everyone a Happy Ending to their story

<text>As an introduction to the Shiley experience, we waited there 40 minutes past the appointment time without any update.  Due to Covid-19 protocol, there were few places to sit.  As people were called, they placed a note on the chair indicating it had to be sprayed/sanitized prior to using.  No one sanitized the chairs, so they sat with notes on them while elderly people stood waiting.   it was obvious the "system" wasn't working albeit plenty of staff to fix the problem.  We grew tired of waiting in that environment and cancelled the appointment.  They need their "Dedicated Experience Specialists" to be PROactive rather than REactive.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1617652461548, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us, D Mor.

<Text>The good - Dr. Savino's admin assistant was incredibly helpful in getting me an appointment to coordinate with my travel from Texas to California. She was also very helpful in explaining the letter I received from Dr. Savino after my appointment.
The bad - The majority of my appointment was attended by Dr. Lin. I explained my problems, history, etc. I saw Dr Savino by telemedicine at the end of my appointment. I received a letter from Dr. Savino 10 days later that completely misstates the issues I described to Dr. Lin. At no time did I describe my issues as the one stated in the letter. The letter also states that it was dictated in my presence which is completely false. If that had happened, I would have corrected and questioned the content of the letter.
To add insult to injury, I was told today there is no way to contact these doctors to ask for an explanation. They are not on the Epic system.
My doctor in Texas was copied on this letter and since it describes issues that are unknown to her (and me), the communication is worthless.
I need accurate information to continue pursuing an answer to my vision problems. I have none at this point.
The appointment was a complete waste of time and energy.</Text><rate>1< /rate><user>108034427694692943363< /user>< gmapID>

<review>The worst!!
My daughter needed glasses at 1 yo and we had Kaiser- had to change insurances and since there are only a handful of pediatric ophthalmologist Shiley  was one that we Research that had reputable doctors. Well first it took forever to get through the maze of numbers and receptionist, that were not helpful at all to even get an appointment and confirm insurance coverage.  Both doctors we researched that were pediatric were unavailable but we were told that the other doc could help and were pediatric as well. We went for the first appointment and they didn’t have us with the right doctor but again assured us that they could see our daughter. We were seen by 1 nurse 2 fellows another nurse and finally the doctor, who was in and out in 5 min, and suggested another appointment and another RX for her glasses. They also suggested that she might need surgery and that we should prepare for that just to be done.  We got the new prescription for my daughter and made another appointment 2 months later. At the 2 month appointment they double dilated her eyes, told us she needed a new rx  (and kids glasses are not cheap and most of the time need to be custom) and that we should look at surgery schedules since it is muscular and that can only be changed with surgery. We also needed to make another appointment in 2 months. We show up now for the 3rd appointment after 2 month and they tell us she needs surgery, a new RX and that we needed (like we knew we should have been and this was the first time it was mentioned)  to be patching her eye. We asked for a second opinion and they were annoyed that we asked. We reached out to her previous ophthalmologist for recommendations and a second opinion and she gave us the name and was surprised that Shiley saw us considering both of their pediatricians were out. Once we saw a new doctor for a second opinion he said that our daughter did not need surgery, did not need eyepatching, and that the prescription that she was given was completely wrong and was making her eyes worse. Luckily my daughter is doing much better now and is able to see with her corrected prescription. But then the nightmare wasn’t over, we were sent bills of over $1000 for the multiple appointments for out of network coverage since the doctors that did see her are not part of our plan, Even though the two pediatric ophthalmologists were. The whole thing left us upset, but it was the fact that the first thing suggested was surgery when my daughter did not need it. Would rather pay for better care out of network than return there.</review><rating>1<//rating>< Pics>

<text>Had an emergency on a Friday evening. I went to the emergency room and was transferred to UC San Diego. Two doctors came and did a through examination came up with a plan and set me up for 8:00 am on Saturday. Dr. Knight was there ready for me. He took his time, made sure I was comfortable the entire time. I am very thankful for everyone and the care I received. Dr. Knight is amazing and very smart. Thank you to Dr.Chan and I didn’t catch her name but the doctor that worked with her was also excellent thank you all.

Update
Well my tear actually required surgery with Dr. Freeman and Dr. Knight. I have trouble with twighlight anesthesia so they put me to sleep for the procedure. The anesthesiologist was very professional and waited for the doctor in case I had any questions. The procedure went fast and was painless and I had a follow up appointment yesterday and again I have to give them 5 stars. I think Dr. Knight is going to be a top notch retinal specialist after his fellowship with Dr. Freeman is through. Dr. Freeman is an excellent doctor. I have also been seeing another specialist at UC San Diego for my bladder Dr. Parsons and he too is in my opinion at the top of his field.</text>< pics>

Go see anyone else

I came in for a 3rd opinion ophthalmologist visit on an eye issue I've been having. They rushed me into a bandage surgery, downplaying both how much it would affect me and how much it would cost. I thought I was just getting a contact in my eye - turns out I was bed ridden in pain for days, unable to look at any screens or brightness. I spent the first several days in excruciating pain which they said wouldn't happen, when I called to tell them about it they literally told me to "just stop using that eye". Oh thanks. We went from "you'll be able to work" to "just stop using that eye." When I saw the doctor a week later he was surprised by my reaction and downplayed it. Thanks buddy.

Anyway I just got charged 5k for a procedure I wasn't at all prepared for and would have never accepted. Lost over 1k in wages due to lost work. Staff needs to work on their communication. I've seen several ophthalmologists in the area and not all of them were good but they were all much better than this.

Oh hey they were taking great covid safety procedures though I'll give them 1 star for that!

***update*** any other san diego ophthalmologist would have charged me 300-500 dollars for what this place charged me 5k for.</review>

< Review>
Dr. Weinreb saved my husbands eyesight.  The majroity of the frustrations in these comments around wait times and bedside manner honestly feel quite irrelevant when you are talking about the ridiculious technology, experience and amazing advancements at Shiely Eye with Weinreb leading the charge.  I can only imagine the time and sacrifice that has gone into making Shiley what it is today.

We travel from far northern California in order  to see Weinreb and after my husbands most recent surgery he  was  experiencing  post op pain.  He worked us  into the  clinic and saw him 6 times in one day until we could get the cause of his pain under control.

So next time you are having to wait, maybe remeber that there are patients who he is fighting to make space for when they are in crisis.

Bring a  book.

Lastly, we  have experienced nothing but kindness and attentivness by Dr. Weinreb and his staff.

Again, he literally saved his sight with our local doctor gave  us  no hope.  I don't care if we have to wait a bit or if he is only in the room a couple of minutes.  We are forever profoundly grateful for him and his team.<//Review>

< Review>
I’ve always had a great experience here with my eye exams in the past. I recently scheduled my yearly eye exam and I needed it ASAP so I took the earliest appointment I could get. My appointment was with Dr. Maria Laura Gomez Freeman. She checks my vision with my contacts in, then asks me to take them out. I ask “where can I put my contacts?” And she says “you didn’t bring your case?” Sounding annoyed as she opens the cabinets getting the contact case and solution. After this I didn’t try to engage in any conversation with her unless it was related to that appointment. We get to the phoropter for my eyeglasses prescription. Because of covid we are required to wear masks and if you wear glasses, you know it gets foggy. Well I fogged up the phoropter and Dr. Freeman got mad at me for fogging up the equipment and told me not to do it again as if I was doing it on purpose. She did engage in some small talk towards the end of my exam, but my impressions on her were already set. She just wasn’t very personable and came off a bit rude. Well definitely ask for my usual optometrist next time.< /Review>

If they tell you they will call you when it's time for your next appointment, don't believe it.  I waited for their call and finally called to schedule my the appointment myself.  My vision has gotten much worse in the last year and the soonest appointment I can get is over 3 months away.  They said they don't keep a waiting list in case of a cancellation either. If I didn't have such a great doctor there, I wouldn't return.< /review>

<Review>Dr. Natalie Afshari provided me the most efficient and professional service. I have been to several ophthalmologist, but none like Dr. Afshari. I was looking for the best ophthalmologist in San Diego because I had not been able to find why my eyes were always irritated. In a question of minutes, Dr. Afshari was able to provide me with the appropriate diagnosis. I recommend Dr. Ashari over any other ophthalmologist in San Diego.< /Review>< pics>

I am patient of Shiley Eye Institute at UC San Diego Health the past 15 years with multiple eye surgeries and visit to all the departments.
Shiley Eye Institute has gotten worse over the years and it makes me sad to have to accept that.

In the past I filled out many surveys but don’t see any improvements to the way that some doctors treat the patients. Having the Interns to cover the most of the doctors job, doesn’t provide quality visit, Doctors see you only 5 minutes and don’t write any notes, At least if they enter their notes to the Epic portal I can read it.
What is the purpose of that system if is not used properly?

My latest visit experience was pathetic. I saw the doctor only for 2 minutes and i had to come back to take pictures. Any other place they take picture the same day and time. I find it amazing all these years. And I don’t see any notes in the portal or any callback to tell me how was the pictures.
To be fair, some of the departments doing a good job and the doctors care about the patients.
I plan not to use them again or on limited basis with some doctors< /Review>

I purchased a new pair of glasses at the optical shop. I had also ordered sunglasses which attach to the frames. When the sunglass attachment arrived, they were extremely disappointing. Very cheap looking and difficult to attach. The staff were very professional and allowed me to return them for a refund. Hated the "clip-ons", loved the service!< /Review>

I've been to Shiley many times this year.  No problem getting appointments, and my wait time has never been over 15-20 minutes.  The staff has always been very nice and professional.  I only had to show my insurance cards once, when I checked in for the first time.  They always verify my identification, but I have no problem with the process.  I appreciate that kind of security check.<//Text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>After two days of processing my experiences recently at Shiley Eye Institute and my total experience at UCSD Medical facilities, I have come to a hard but freeing decision, I will no longer seek care with them. I am a Black, unmarried woman in my mid 40’s,  with five children and currently unemployed. If you were to place all of those titles in a box, I would be the classic black stereotype, a stereotype that would not be applied to my female white counterpart, but I am forced to bear. I am a stereotype that UCSD Medical Center could not see passed. In the last several months I have had to come to terms with the outright bigotry of the doctors I was subjected to and in their defense they were exposed to the anger I carried for a lifetime of being treated poorly for nothing deeper than the shade of my skin. I can’t say my despair began at UCSD, but I can say the reality of who I am did. I truly believed that my quality of life and their ability to help me would overcome any system mired in bigotry, I was wrong. You all may think this is a letter of injustice and frustration and maybe even a week ago it would have been, but now it isn’t. UCSD made me see my blackness, I proclaimed myself as a “True American” because I carried the blood of immigrant, native, and slave; but UCSD made me understand that what I am is Black and for that I am grateful to them. I know longer feel the need to straightened my hair or give credit to my Irish immigrant grandmother for the length there of. Now I walk in as a Black woman expecting nothing and no longer disappointed when that is exactly what I get. UCSD, you have shown me that I am self-created, and my dignity is not worth a cure I am truly grateful and glad in this lesson. I have never mentally felt stronger, despite my physical limitations. I looked in the mirror and saw me, it was my moment that you provided via doctors like your esteemed neurological ophthalmologist who spoke to his recorder (about me so was unable to speak to me). I listened as he made comments on my obvious health, though he did not know that I spent two days sitting to avoid exhaustion during his appointment or that I spent another day resting after. He rolled his eyes several times when I could not recall names and commented on my not wanting to have a disease that I seem to believe I had or in his mind, I wanted to have. I smiled when he turned his back on me with a final comment not even showing the common courtesy to hear my response. This time I did not walk out angry but exhilarated because I had decided what they saw was unimportant but what they allowed me to see was priceless. I think it will take several days to wash my blackness from him and I pray that he is able to do that, not because of forgiveness, I have none; not because of mercy, at this time, it is not in me. I wish it so that he will never know what is to be with someone who is strong and dignified even when people would cast you as otherwise. I will offer no names because in the end it is not the number of racist doctors I experience at UCSD but the very system that nourishes this bigotry that they are unequipped to handle, because despite numerous complaints from my people and action from the State they still do not believe it to be an issue. So I have decided to end my relationship with UCSD and accept that I will probably never run in hills with my son again, but even that is okay because I can sit and talk to him of my discovery of self  and UCSD's help in that. I must, however, acknowledge the Doctors , nurses, operators, and staff who despite this toxic environment treated me with nothing but dignity, consideration, and to the best of their abilities answers, and where no answers existed, they were humane enough to let me walk out with hope and those I will name. Dr. Deluba, Dr. Jewbleski, all the nurses that I have encountered, all the reception I have encountered, the phone attendants who had to process my anger when I could not and even the bigots because you taught something a textbook never could and in that I am glad.</Text>< pictures>

I had a 1:45pm appt I don't even know why I bothered to be there on time I wasn't seen for over an hour for a scheduled appointment then over 2 hours later I'm still waiting to be seen by the attending. Does anyone understand basic management of a practice? Get it together people. I now get to drive home in 5pm traffic because a simple 15 minute appointment couldn't be managed in a reasonable amount of time. Totally unacceptable for a business to run this inefficiently. Plenty of other busy medical offices manage to see patients in an appropriate amount of time. Only good thing about them is UCSD has good doctors. ONLY good thing.<//Text>

Yesterday I took my 3 year old daughter (Toddler!) for her Annual check up. Firts, The Intern that checked my daughter’s eyes was not interactive at all with my daughter, it was like she was talking to an Adult, “look at me”, “no! Turn this way”.. not at all friendly, like she had never interacted with a child. Second, we waited 3 hours to FINALLY see the REAL DOCTOR, Dr. R. and by that time my Toddler was exhausted, it was 4:45pm and we had arrived at 1:45pm. Those of you who are parents understand the feeling. This wait time for a 3 year old patient is NOT OK. By that time my daughter did not want to get her yes touched anymore she was tired and hungry, so the Real Doctor did not get to check her eyes. Lastly, when we finally got to see the real Doctor she said ,”everything is ok , I’ll see you in a year”. So we waited 3 hours to get my daughters eyes dialated, checked by an INTERN, who is not a Real doctor yet, and the Doctor revealed the news that everything is ok.  It is very frustrating to see that professional doctors don’t take children and families into consideration. Definitely changing doctors. P.S. I should have read the reviews before going.< /review>

<name>Timothy Kipling</name><review>I have been trying for several days to schedule an appointment with Dr. Heichel, I am a patient at Balboa Naval Hospital and have been referred to UCSD Ophthalmology since they needed a specialist to take care of and perform the needed surgery on my eye.  This referral was set-up by my insurance Tricare.  I have called several times over the past ten days.  I have left several voice mails with his assistant Bonnie.  Her voicemail directs me to call the Shiley Eye Institute. When I call them, I get put on hold, disconnected, told to call back, etc.  No one is willing to help me.  Again, my referral was for Dr. Christopher Heichel at UCSD Medical in Hillcrest.   I have had to call my insurance provider and explain that I cannot get in contact with anyone to make an appointment.  Therefore, I have to start the process over and have Tricare get me a new provider, two weeks lost because someone cannot answer a phone or help in scheduling an appointment.  Tricare has requested that I fill out formal statement and will investigate if this provider should be removed as a Tricare Provider.  I believe all the reviews on here about their customer service.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dc06d84e455f87:0xfb6543aa5e8aa6c4< /Gmap_id><response>{'time': 1566945224859, 'text': "Hi Timothy,\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

The one star is only for the doctors, which are great albeit curt. The wait here is unbelievably long. I often have to take the whole day off work to come. Last time, I got there at 7AM and left near 2PM. Today, my appointment was at 2PM. It is almost 4PM now and I'm yet to be seen by the doctor. After almost 2 years coming here, I have yet to figure out how they organize the order in which they call patients, because it is not by appointment or arrival time.</Review>

<review>If you have serious eye issues and want to be able to see do not go here. I thought I was coming to the best surgeon around ( Dr. Grante) but he is not.  He will manage to do your surgery but he will never be around for you afterwards to complete it or to make sure things turn out right which they did not.</review>< pics>

Dr.Afshari is fantastic!
I had cataract surgery on both eyes and they turned out better than expected.
One day after surgery I had 20/20 vision
I had no idea that it was even possible.
Thank you Dr.Afshari I really could not be more thrilled.< /text>

Bad from start to finish

I don’t have insurance. For my first visit I asked for pricing up front. It was expensive but I agreed to pay in person right then. A week later, I receive a bill in the mail, asking for more money. I bring it up to them for my follow up visit. First they tell me I should call UCSD billing because Shiley can’t do anything about it. I persist, and won’t you know, turns out they can fix it right there. They fix it, so whatever.

After my second visit the doctor suggests to me I get some testing done at the Perlman Labs. I ask for a price. Again they tell me they can’t help me - call Perlman. So I do. They tell me I need to talk to billing. I call Billing; they tell me I need to talk to Shiley, because Shiley didn’t send them the correct codes. Shiley tells me they did. Well, I go around in circles each blaming the other. I am sick of it and after over 2 hours on the phone I lose it. They agree to figure it out internally. Well that doesn’t happen. I never get a price, not even a ball park. I don’t know if it’s gonna cost $100 or $10,000. My insurance kicks in in August, but I’d prefer to have it done now if possible. But not if it’s prohibitively expensive.

So I bring this up at my third visit. She tells me verbatim, “Perlman Labs is just up the street. Why don’t you walk over there your self?” I mean I really can’t believe it. Three UCSD departments that can’t figure out a process, so they put the burden on the patients to figure this out. It is insane to me. I don’t know if the staff is incompetent, the process is broken, or what. But it’s down right pathetic. I came to UCSD so I wouldn’t risk going to some fly by night operation. Well, I’m not going back. How can I trust these people to handle my records?

I’ve maybe filed 1 official complaint ever in my life. I’m filing another.< /Review>

Watch out for the scam with parking. A thorough eye exam, was followed by the shock that I had a yellow slip on my car. I read the slip and found out that I was being shaken down for 65 USD for parking without a "permit". When I checked in for the  appointment, the receptionist did not mention that I would need a parking permit. Years ago when I came, the permits were provided automatically. How was I to know that I was expected to go to a machine and purchase a 1 USD permit per hour? When I complained about this, I was told the signs are everywhere. If they were everywhere, I would have purchased the permit.  I then had to call a number only to be told that I must appeal the fine.   I asked to speak to the General Manager of the hospital.  I was told she would tell me the same thing.  How would you like to come to a clinic and then find out that you are being fined 65 USD simply because of the negligence of the reception staff, and the whole check in process?  Why was I not told that I needed a permit? Why are there no signs on the check-in desk?  Needless to say I will not be paying any such fines, but this is going to take up my time unnecessarily. Shiley - you can do a lot better than this.   Put up signs and ensure they are visible for all to see. Ensure your less than caring receptionists provide information about the parking situation upon check-in.< /Review>

I've been a patient at Shiley for over 3 years.  I've had positive and negative experiences.  The staff is professional and polite.

Many reports by other patients indicate rude and unprofessional treatment from Dr. Weinrib.  Other doctors at Shiley  are much better at their craft and are considerate of their patients.
As  a learning institution, a patient can expect  excessively long waits to see a variety of medical personnel before seen by the specialist.  I continue as a patient because  in my opinion, the positives outweigh the negatives.< /Review>

If I could give a minus star I would for this doctor. We waited months to see the doctor. I filled out the form and wrote down what was rong with my child and gave it to them when we arrived. When we got in, 4 different people came in to the room before we finally saw the doctor. ALL of the people that came in the room asked the same question: Whay are you here? We were referred by Rady's Children. They should have had the notes. (since they would not give me an appointment without the notes, I knew they did) Well, they could not find the notes so they asked me to find the phone number for the Rady's Children. Really??? In the mean while we waited 2.5 hour to see him answering the same question, why we are there. They did not dilalete  my sons eyes. Just took 1 picture of the cornea! That was it! When we finally saw the doctor, he spent 5 minutes with us. When I asked why he was not dialated he says: "I do not look at the back of the eye you need to see someone else for it" !!! What a horrible experience!! What a waste of my time. Please go somewhere else.<//review>

If you go for any appointment, bring a tent.  The wait time is terrible, partly due to the fact that you have to talk to interns, residents, medical students, etc. before you ever see a doctor.  They all ask the same questions, and it is absolutely laborious.  The actual doctor comes in and barely has enough time to talk to you.  It is a terrible system.  I like the doctor I saw, Dr. Andrew Camp, but be prepared to 2.5 - 3 hours for an initial appt.<//Review>

First cataract surgery went really well, great results.    Second cataract surgery I could see really well the  week after, though I had no more close-up vision    Then within a week later I had really bad vision and some Blurry  watery spots, and was told that it would settle down and I requested a visit anyway.   And sure enough  I had inflammation and fluid  in the eye which can happen with surgery but is very rare (macular Edema) and It took a couple of months of drops of two different types for it to subside somewhat.   When I returned I found out that I could have perfect distance vision with glasses which is what I had before surgery and I still didn't have my close-up vision and I still have blurry spots to go through my eye but I was told that I no longer have the fluid  and if I was really unhappy to come back in six months.    The doctor also told me that the insurance didn't cover it that getting a toric lens which cost me $1000 more would help my vision, and clearly it did not.  Then I got a letter that my new insurance is not covered by Shirley  and to find another provider so overall I'm very disappointed and yes on this last one I had to wait two and more than three hours for some of my appointments.  Having said this do I believe Dr Weinreb  is A great surgeon, absolutely.    Do I also believe and was told that complications can happen with any top surgeon in any top facility, absolutely.< /review>

<review>We went for 2nd opinion re immediate surgery by other place following catarac surgery. Professional, polite, and thourough services. Not only was surgery not called for, but given swelling to corneal it could have caused permanent damage and liss of vision. Did research, which confirms what Dr Freeman at Shiley diagnosed. Saved my 83 year old father' vision.</review><Rating>5<//Rating>< Date>

I tried to make an appointment with them they took me to registration office checking my insurance, my referral doctor and etc for 43 minutes.  finally they told me I am already registered with them. then send me back to scheduling department, Manni was there She was acting like I have to big her to talk to me let alone to make an appointment with them,  if they were trained well they must know we ( all patients )  have lots of choices to pick, in realty they have to big us to go there.

Nobody get back to my mom until I will be looking for medical expert that specializes in Phthisis Bulbi which was I have surgical  failure to treat Macular Hole by Dr. Shakin since April 5, 2006 the last operation.  Once again, we regret that we're looking for medical expert in the New York area that specializes in Phthisis Bulbi and medical biology research in Glaucoma to lower my eye pressure with Focal Laser Cyclophotocoagulation (FLCP) to treat advanced glaucoma while my eye pressure is 26 mm Hg since Dr. Ritch and Dr. Tello.  This will go by new technology with medical expert.for Glaucoma & Phthisis Bulbi.< /review>

I have been a patient for many years, but I fired them this morning. After driving 45 minutes, and waiting 45 minutes, I decided to find another provider. I have a 45 minute rule and will not wait more than 45 minutes for ANYONE. It tells me that the provider has no respect for my time.</review>

But when trying to call today (for over ½ hour) I kept getting the phone picked up & immediately hung up, very frustrating & unprofessional on this instance. Only wanted to know how long the lobby was open to be able to collect my box mail. Here is for anyone else curious (it wasn't always open 24 hrs - in the past, I missed the cutoff time & was closed in the PAST).

<review>Received a note at my door that my package was ready for pickup at this location, stood in line for ~15 minutes, and then the clerk informs me that my package is still on the truck. Other than that one personal experience, the clerks are rushed, difficult  to understand, and it is dirty. Also, the entrance to the postal office can be easily missed. On a positive note, there is plenty of parking!< /review>< Pictures>

I filed a claim with them after not receiving my package even though it had been “out for delivery” for a week. I had a missed call from them yesterday, regarding my package. I called back within 20 minutes of the missed call and no one answered. I called multiple times throughout the day and not once did anyone answer. I’ve been calling today and the first few times it wouldn’t even ring. The last time I called it started ringing and STILL got no answer.< /Review>

If I could give this postal branch 5 negative stars, that still would not be enough. So back in May 2020 I purchased an item on ebay and I received an alert when the package delivered I immediately went to my mailbox and the package was not there, because in the past I've received packages that belonged to a neighbor from the street behind me with my same street #"s I walked over there and my neighbor checked there were letters she had received in her mailbox but no package. I contacted my local postal branch customer service which is a total joke, they told me they would research it and when I talked to them I was told by Julieta that she could see it was delivered to an address across the street from my house (already acknowledging that they screwed up). I was told they would still have to reach out to the letter carrier. Well today 6/4/20 I spoke to another customer service rep Nancy, and I was told that since it was not insured and I could not file a claim even though they admitted to misdelivering it totally there fault, "there was nothing I could do". I have seen the horrible reviews for this postal branch and I can only think that  maybe they have some dishonest letter carriers that know when there is no insurance on a package that its a free for all. Again this is my personal opinion pretty sad we can't trust our postal service to do a decent job.</Text>

The worst post office I've seen yet. 3rd time where they mark my packages as delivery attempted when I've been home all day for 3 different occasions. Today they did that early morning and later on the postal worker came to deliver a different package. Time to open a 3rd claim and get no response as usual. UPS is the way to go!< /text>

<Review>Terrible. Passport services hours posted do not reflect that they are now by appointment only. Only the hours that services are rendered. Checked the times. Got what we needed came back... was told, even though the lobby was pretty empty, that an appointment was required after you first came into the post office at 830 am and stood in line. Two trips for one thing that could have been easily rendered. The man behind the counter gave me a full on story about how people broughtg I  a ton of kids and were waiting everyday. How the kids ran around and cried and the people applying had other places to be.... which had no bearing on our situation as we were two adults... no kids and the place was empty. He made some type of excuse about only being able to do 17 passports a day.... don't waste your time.</Review>< Pictures>

The service is good and friendly. This post office have more parking than others. The post office is not very clean. The floor and the counters are not very clean and they have stuff all over the place. Great location to find the post office. You don't have to wait too long at the post office. Good place to visit .📮 👍< /review>

The staff or employees customer service is horrible, at this postal location. Very rude. Even so much to say disrespectful. I don't understand why. Please please please talk to these employees. Have meetings with them about having pride for the neighborhood, better work ethic, customer service can be improved drastically and so easily.< /Text>

I have received the best service from this post  office than others.    They treat their  customers fairly  more than they deserve especially when  the hostile customers are behaving in a rude manner towards the employees....</Review>

<Review>Worst customer service from Cindy. She treats customer in a terrible way.  If you are a foreigner, please AVOID CINDY because the way she speaks to you is like she feels superior to you while she doesn't know about her job and customer service. Other staffs are nice.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80c3345d889b0823:0xbad812b2798d1e9f< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wish other post office follow this one as a good lead example to the rest.  However, there's no self service machine here.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Text>The front office is excellence. The back office for business drop off is terrible, they starts the new practice to limit the drop off, so all the clerks can be lazy and not loading any mails. All they want is to going home earlier and not take care of customers. Especially,  one of the big, heavy lady, she always boss customers and clerks in front of people.
They should go back to the basic, serve the customers, and provide some more friends drop off services.< /Text><date>1436483777075</date>< Name>

By mistake i left a UPS package here at this location.  After not receiving updates on The tracking number i went back to the location. My understanding is when packages that can not be scanned they hold at their location and notify fedEx or UPS to pick up their packages. What should have happend was UPS would have been contacted to pick up my item.  I was told UPS had already picked up several items. Once UPS came in contact with my pckage i would have started receiving updates.  Thats not what happen.  My item is lost or stolen at this moment. I have been given different stories from several different emoloyees here.  I spoke to the gentlemen i originally handed my package to.  He stated its not their job to verify the correct lables.  He stated my package was sent to city of industry.   Another employee stated its not possible the item got sent to City of Industy because they would have needed to scan it. And because the item was UPS lable not possible for it to leave the Ontario Location. She also stated UPS would have gotten it by now since they have been their already. The only thing that makes since is my package is lost in the Ontario location and no one can find it. Or it was stolen.   Over all the expierence here  has shown me that these employees dont care about ther job and dont take pride. They all have sent me away.  But On my third visit one gentlemen that worked there did the right thing bu taking down my contact info. Im thankful that he at least tried to help.< /Text>

<Review>I was biting my lip anticipating the horrible service I read so much about, but was rather surprised. I got to the line at the office not even for five minutes and they had clerks asking if anyone was there for pickup. I got my package in minutes, no hassle no mumbo jumbo. Friendly service.< /Review>< time>

Horrible customer service!! I showed up @ 1:15 to receive my passport & the man who worked there who was of Asian descent refused to help me. Their cutoff time for passports is 3 pm & so I asked him why he would not help & he said it was because there were 2 people in front of me (who just so happened to be Asian as well). I went to another post office & it took 10-15 tops to receive my passport. I believe the man was racist.. never going to this post office again.</Review>

<Text>Flora has to be the worst customer service agent I have ever interacted with. She tried speaking as if I were subordinate to her.

I have a long term problem with my mail delivery.  The mail man always send our mail to a exact address as ours; our address says North Carlos with the same house number and zip code.   And some other family's have the same address instead of North carlos they live in south carlos.  I do not know why the post office pay more attention with their delivery.  I AM MISSING A LOT OF MAIL DUE TO THEIR LACK OF ATTENTION.  this is not good because some one else receives all my confidential mail.< /Text>

<Text>The service used to be okay here. It became a totally unpleasant place to visit ever since the Asian lady who looks like a customer service supervisor started to appear. She's extremely rude unless you speak Chinese. Also the way she manages things seems inefficient.  The wait line is long especially if you want to pick up a parcel. The delivery status is no longer accurately recorded. It's a total mess. Avoid this branch.< /Text>< userid>

It doesn't even deserve one star ! I call and no one answers ! And on top of that they are full of mess ! I literally sat on my balcony to see if they were going to bring my package that I had to sign for and they didn't even come near my door . I called after them and they just smirked and left (people in charge of the Waverly Apartments mail in Ontario CA) I kept a look out . And before that I even went and asked to see if they would give me my package !!! But noo instead I have to give a bad review because people can't do their job !! I'm pissed !! Beyond it for that matter !!! This is the second time !!!! They are such liars !</Text>

<text>Amazing tailor. They have always done terrific work for my daughter. They allow women with curves to wear beautifully fitting clothes, instead boxy sacks. They are honest when they feel they can’t make something work or they feel it will not be worth the money. komey has always been wonderful with us. Actual going today to pick up clothes. The assistants have also been extremely helpful as i had a bunch of questions to ask beforehand and they were not annoyed at the least.</text><Rate>5</Rate><Name>Torsten Reuter<//Name>< Response>

Customer service is beyond the norm, simply put: customer service is GREAT! We were in town for a funeral and our clothes were cleaned and delivered to the nearby hotel. Thank you again for the wonderful service. May your business be blessed beyond measure in 2020!</Text>

The work was professional quality. The owners were very accommodating, promising that the work would be complete days before I requested, and the dress was ready a day earlier than promised.

<Review>Fantastic job altering my oversized fully sequined birthday suit. I bought it 2-3 sizes too big because it was the only one left and prayed it could be altered. It had to be taken in everywhere. Shoulders, cuffs, hem, back pleating. An even bigger challenge because the suit is partially sequined. komie worked magic and it came out just as I had pictured in my head. I received so many compliments on my suit. Great work and wonderful staff too!</Review></record>

The experience here has been pleasant to say the least. I've brought my wedding dress to get altered and so far so good. The young man here has been extremely helpful has I couldn't get my zipper up from my backside. He measured side to side to explain how these areas looked crooked and helped fix them to give me balance. I would be happy to give more stars if I could. I also had my shoulders taken in and they also got the stain removed from when I was at the bridal shop earlier today. Overall, I am happy to know these people are wonderful and appreciative of my concerns.< /Review>

These folks are fantastic! Komie does excellent work and they are professional and quick. For those complaining about the price? Great quality work take time and skill. I have everything tailored here and even the folks up the street will recommend you go to divisadero height cleaners. They've been doing this for years. Don't even think - just GO!<//review>

<text>Love this place! I usually don't write reviews but after discovering this nearby tailor online and receiving phenomenal service, I definitely wanted to share what happened. I had a skirt that was very design-specific and wasn't sure if it would be able to be tailored without messing up the design but dhc did a great job! It was a little pricier for the job but I was so excited when I picked it up that I wore it out the door to my brunch that evening because it fit so perfectly. Would definitely come again to get any of my other pieces fixed up.</text>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Not a whole lot that I can say that hasn't already been said. Various friends and I have used their dry cleaning service. This isn't 1 of those crazy fast same day types of cleaners, but I've always had good luck w/ them regarding time. I always get my clothes back the day of or earlier than when they say it should be ready.
Their quality of work has always been good. No mess ups. I and friends have brought all sorts of garments there (uniforms, suits, very large heavy body length coats to small light, fur, suede, leather, silk, polyester, cotton, etc.) always w/ excellent results.
Customer service has always been top notch and very helpful. Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable.
Pricing really runs the gamut, but it never seems overpriced. This isn't the $1 dry cleaner, but it's hardly expensive either, and anyway, the quality, punctuality, professionalism is worth paying slightly more than the super bargain basement bottom of the barrel places (I've had some bad experiences w/ the uber cheap places before). Simple things like uniforms, small items, regular shirts, pants, etc. are competitively priced. I've definitely paid much larger chunks of $ ($30+, $40+) for a single item there, but it's definitely warranted. That's for very large heavy items, heavily soiled items (like baby puke on my suit), and/or high end items requiring special care like fur, fancy sequins & embroidery, super high thread count wool, silk. They take credit cards as payment.
Hours seem pretty reasonable. They aren't open super late or crazy early, but it's understandable considering they're a small business.< /review>< pictures>

This lady is always on point and so friendly! No matter what mine or my family needs are, they get it done. Expedited service is available too!! Prices are modest and I appreciate that they are honest when something will take longer than I’m hoping for as other providers lie to just gain your business.</Text>

I'm only 5'6", so practically everything I buy has to be hemmed. I've been trusting Komie for years with my alterations from simple hems to changing necklines and taking in jackets! She's never disappointed me! Excellent quality work and amazing customer service! I recommend her to everyone!!</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>I have brought two bridesmaid dresses altered here along with my daughters and both were done perfectly! Just dress hems and the back waist needed adjustment and yet the young man here helped with everything my daughters needed. he was super kind and professional but above all, he explained throughly how the work would be approached and gave me an estimate as well as the final cost later on before work was to begin. Both dresses had to be done in less than a week and the staff in DHC never had a problem with getting the dresses done in that time frame. Definitely come here if you’re looking for a friendly professional place to get the dress altered! Not only that, the staff here are patient with their customers.< /text>< Pictures>

On saturday, She decided to try it on again and it did not fit due to a BIG STOMACH! I also needed my jacket altered too. They said they could replace the zipper with with a new one. The dress however for my granddaughter had to take in the back of the dress.. I informed them the flight was Wednesday morning. They said that would be no problem and they could also do the lining for the jacket. I was told I would receive a call the next few days when the alterations were ready. They called me early on Tuesday as promised. The dress and jacket fit perfect on my granddaughter and me. Everyone at the wedding thought i looked amazing. I looked and felt awesome, thanks to divisadero height cleaners. If ratings were 1 to 10, I would give them 100. Their customer service is outstanding! I highly recommend them. Thanks for making this SENIOR HAPPY.!< /text>< Pics>

<Review>I have been coming here for quite some time, and I can say that they have been my tailor of choice in SF. I have tried many tailors throughout California, and divisadero height cleaners are the best. Service is excellent, owners are polite, and they always treat you fairly amongst all their customers. (hard to find in this town)

I have been reluctant to take my suits to just any tailor in fear that they might mess it up. However, based on some of the prior work I had done with them, they have done four shirts for me, which I am very pleased with. They understand the fit so the fitting is effortless.

Price is fair compared to the market for tailoring. However, when you factor in how good the garment comes out, you really feel like it is a bargain. I have bought quite a few suits from norstrom (sale) that I have taken there which now fit better than the one I have bought at Suit Supply.

Highly Recommend on all fronts.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Did a great job with hemming my wifes dress and in a timely matter. Komie worked with her as I came a little under a month before the wedding to get altered. Was okay on the price. Did however later notice one of the buttons on my dress had fallen off when she returned my gown but it was in a place you really couldn't notice and I was too busy to go back and see if she had found it. She also bustled to the dress and that was good as well.< /Review>

Divisadero Height Cleaners provided me great customer service! I needed to get my jeans altered and found dhc. I read great reviews and thought I would stop by check to them out. They did a wonderful job and it only took them 2 days to finish. Also, a compliment to their front desk worker who I had a pleasure in having great conversations about history. Such a nice and passionate guy!
The seamstress takes extreme care in seeing what alterations overall would be nice and caters to whatever needs and fit you may want. She also takes time to think about what you can afford and what alterations are a priority over others and works to accomodate your needs. So friendly every time I come in, and will most likely recommend to any friend who needs a tailor. Thank you!< /text>

<text>"Phenomenal work. Appropriately priced. Timely manner. Very communicative. Great attention to detail. Komie & her staff are super sweet, kind all on top how busy they seemingly are... If this is all you read, it is all you need to know!

I was looking to create a custom piece for my daughters dresses, particularly a skirt hem and reduction in the bust area from excess fabric. I failed to order enough material, but between the sample pattern I had and their work - they brought my daughters eyes to life! Not to mention, this is not something they normally do. Thanks so much DHC for the wonderful Tailoring & Alterations!"<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Komie is very patient, friendly, and takes the time to understand your personal style, which makes me feel very comfortable coming here. This is in contrast to other tailor shops I've been to where owners are often older, stuck in their ways, and rude. I highly recommend divisadeo height cleaners. After using a couple bad tailors in SF (misaligned seams / crooked stitching / not ready on time) it's a relief to have a great tailoring experience. Prices are reasonable and paid up front. Shirt and pants were ready on time and looked fantastic. Service was great and staff was kind.<//Review><rating>5< /rating>< Pictures>

<Review>I was a little hesitant after reading a review that the guy working there was creepy, but I wish I had just listened. He kept asking questions about whether or not I needed to wear a bra with my outfits even though I was just hemming the length of a dress and jumpsuit. He suggested taking unnecessary measurements and made a poor attempt at explaining why he needed them so I left.<//Review>< Pictures>

I called and came by with the damage to their store and they told me to leave the jumpsuit with them!!! The job was done within an hour!! The best place ever if you happen to have an accident. Only one open on a saturday night as well . Very affordable and the lady was really nice to me ! Will definitely come again if need be.</review><user_id>113987904563635493164<//user_id>< Date>

<review>"First time here. I will definitely go back. I can't say how happy I am with DHC. The work the did (full romper set tailoring) was fantastic. I needed it fast and they turned it around fast. Swung by on thursday, was measured and picked it up on next Saturday morning.
I also feel obligated to talk about the people. When I called the first time, I was actually shocked at how nice and friendly they were even though i spoke with thme for over one hour. Typically when you call a place like this, the person on the phone is annoyed that they had to stop what they were doing to talk to you. Not Komie. Happy, friendly, and super helpful. The same can be said when you go to the location. They are fast, direct, get you in and out quickly. This is only because they are so good.

<username>Melissa Xzavier<//username><Review>Komie @ Divisadero height cleaners is a gem. She keeps things honest in terms of what should be taken in and what would not be worth the $$$. My work event was postponed due to COVID-19 and I took a blazer that is simple for a small ceremony in to be tailored. She did a wonderful job and was really patient with my nerves surrounding the whole thing. The item was tailored to fit amd came out great and fits perfectly. I cannot wait to wear it next week. Komie also altered my spouses stuff and even took out some weird stains. The staff here made sure we were comfortable and were patient enough to explain what was and was not possible. They are a dream, and the seamstress is skilled. They don’t cost an arm and a leg, like some other fitters. Bravo!< /Review>< rating>

<review>Great experience with DHC! I needed alterations to 3 jackets, and chose them based off reviews. The jackets now look brand new (two had a few tears and one had broken zipper). You will pay a price for the service, but to have my jackets restored to such beauty (I had a different jacket repaired before somewhere else, and I might even take it to DHC because its all crumply by the shoulder where the repair was). If you have goods you adore and want them repaired right, go to DHC!< /review><pics>None<//pics><Time>1626613804909< /Time>< userid>

I’ve been a customer with Divisadero Height Cleaners for the past 4 years and their service is always perfect. I have pick up and drop off once a week, and they are always on time. On the occasion when I forget to put my bag out, They have been able to call me and let me know early if i am still in town. The dry cleaning is always impeccably cleaned and pressed. Highly recommend!</Text>

This place is great, they open up later than others so I can come out after work and get my stuff cleaned. I brought a few coats to get cleaned and I saw that they do them in-house. My dog's hair came out along with the drool that came with it. Great service!<//Review>

The clothes I have brought here for cleaning have been great 4+ years ago till now. The people who work here always spend more time than you think checking for stains and mending clothes ever since I dropped by for a question. They will do as best as they can to answer any questions i have had and did not hesitate to do things last minute. Even though I had to move away a few blocks, I still come back here despite two other dry cleaners closer to me. They cleaned my 10 year old rug and some weird uniform I had years ago when I was still working at a boutique store. Not once were they condescending to me when I asked even the stupidest questions about how they would clean certain items. I hope they don't retire anytime soon.< /review>

<review>Short story:
Was busy day!

Had my hair done, my nails done, and my wedding dress put in for alterations at a place that valued my time.

What i wasn't done with are  customers with superiority complexes!

Long story:

I finally got my hair and nails done by myself after not doing them for over 10 years!

I have a wedding coming up in 3 days and brought my wedding dress to this place because of a recommendation from a friend.

As I was standing outside in the cold for God knows how long, this lady was inside arguing that she needed a zipper fixed on a wedding dress/jumpsuit. She shown the problem to both the seamstress and the assistant and expected them to get it done in less than 5 hours..... All tailor shops are closed and wouldn't even bother to respond let alone do a quick job for pennies on the dollar. She tried it on to show how severe the problem was and yet couldn't even fit in the leggings then told the staff that it wasn't even hers. The seamstress questioned the lady and the customer said she owns a rental bridal company and the bride can't wear it so was hoping the seamstress could fix the ladys mistake so the bride wouldn't know. All this is happening as my face underneath my mask dropped and the lady demanded it to be done by the end of the day. This is what I call a MODERN KAREN in their natural habitat. The seamstress then said politely that they do not do subcontracting work at all and has stopped for over 20 years doing that kind of work. The lady huffed and puffed out the door while snatching the jumpsuit back and the box it came in with out the door with crocodile tears.

I thought after the outbreak of covid - 19, people would try to be more patient and sympathetic to small businesses who are struggling yet I find people like this taking advantage of people the second a disaster like this happens to the world.

My own experience was the complete opposite as i got it fitted and didn't have any issues despite my weight gain and small gown. I'm happy with the measurements they made.

No loss for the people working in this business.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< UserId.>

<Review>I just moved in this neighborhood a few weeks ago and needed some jackets altered plus a costume cleaned. The seamstress behind the counter had the patience of a saint while she listened to my demands. I'm a very picky person especially when my tuxedo suit jacket costs over 500$. She had my try it on along with other blazers to adjust the shoulders and sleeves. Got them correct the first time and charged a reasonable price since I'm new. The costume was due to me drunk and she found stains I never knew I had along with torn seams from a blacked out night of fun. I'd wish I knew what I did because that costume REEKED of booze and some "questionable" stains. She wrote a ticket for them and told me to come back a week later. I did as I was asked and came back to clothes that looked far superior than before. She handed me my order and did it with a smile so at the very least I left the business with a good feeling. Places like this need to stick around longer as they provide a necessity in the surrounding neighborhood.<//Review>< Name>

As someone who couldn't find a drycleaner willing to open late in the afternoon, this one manages to fit my criteria! The outbreak definitely caused nearly all others to either cutback on their work hours or outright close. I found them just by chance and dropped off my work suits plus shirts off to clean. Picked them up a week later and so far so good. At the very least, they did a good job with the shirt collars, can;t say the same for my last drycleaner that's for sure.<//review>

<Review>Avoid at all costs. I went in to get a zipper fixed on the back of a jumpsuit and he repeatedly told me I needed to try on the piece, to which I explained it wasn’t mine to try on and wasn’t in my size. He then asked 3x for me to take off my bra and that it was “required” to fix the zipper that I not have a bra on. Even after I said no, he continued that I needed to remove my bra until I took my piece and left. Extremely creepy. I left crying.< /Review>< Pictures>

After I came back, not only did my year old stains came off the suit but also the shirts came back new and custom fitted! The back was taken in and the shirts had their collars adjusted. Best part is the everything was pressed within time constrains!

Glad I found a place close by right after I moved here so I guess I got lucky.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>This is the best place I could find. The last time I came in here, I had a suit that needs alteration and the lady just by looking said my back was too big.

I tried it on and sure enough it was. She altered it and the prices were reasonable.

The time it took was a week and it turned out PERFECT! Im definitely coming back.

I give 1 star to this place because I can’t give 0 or -5...my first time here and I’m not coming back. Very bad experience. I brought a pant for a simple alteration and they gave me an estimate from $15 to max $25. However, when I came back to pick up the pants I got an unexpected surprise of $40. I asked them why the price went up and they said this is the price for the alteration if you don’t pay the $40 we keep the pants..I tried to explain that if you say a price and then the price changes for any reason you should at least call your client and let her/him make their own decision. I wouldn’t pay $40 for an alteration when I can buy new pants for the same price. I feel completely deceived. Not professional - Not decent people: no values at all</Review>

We called Sky for pedicures and they squeezed us in within an hour.  Douglas was AMAZING! I can never make up my mind and Douglas was very patient and kind.  He also did a few different designs on my big toe to see what I liked!  He goes that extra mile, draws the best flowers and takes pride in his work!!  I live an hour away and will definitely make this drive just for Doug!!  ✌️</review>

I called and made an appt for my daughter and I. They started her pedicure about 30 min before they started my nails,  she had to wait almost an hour until I was done. I was not happy with my nails they were all different shapes and they were not how I asked. They didn't even offer a discount. I wont be returning.<//Review>

<review>I've been going to Sky Nails for many years.  Trisha has been my nail Technician for the last few years now and I absolutely love her! Always does a fantabulous job! When she's not there I can go to Danny, Susan, Leo, and others and know that they will be just as good.  It is best that you make an appointment if you go during their busiest times and now with the addition of Andrew, he will do his best to fit you in.  But walk ins are welcome too and they always make every effort to get you in. Always a satisfied customer.  Thank you.<//review>< name>

<Text>I have been coming here for years. My favorite part is the people who work here. They are so friendly and personable I feel like I'm visiting a friend's house. They also do a very nice job with my manicures and pedicures. I typically get gel pedicures which will last me at least a month. And I get dip powder manicures which last almost as long as the pedicures! They have a large variety of colors to choose from and my nails look great for weeks.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<review>I absolutely love love love my nails!! I had gone in to another nail place earlier in the day with two friends and was told my request wasn't doable there. Bummer. I had some specific things I really wanted to do for NYE!! So called around looking for a place that could do 3D art, with little luck. Until Sky Nails rose to the occasion with perfection and sparkle!! The staff was friendly, professional and just the right amount of silliness! I had a great time, and I sm obsessed with my Unicorn Nails!!</review>< Date>

<review>Very kind, clean, and professional. Saturdays are a zoo. Tina did a careful, painless job on my eyebrows. They only accept cash, but apparently there is some sort of discount program when one's services accumulate. I love it there!< /review>< pictures>

They have done some great improvements.   Be was my pedicurist and Susan did my nails. Both were professional and fun. I will only go to Sky nails. They sterilize tools and are conscientious of cleanliness. I don't like it that I can't leave a tip if I use my card.</review>

<review>Went in today for a pedicure and manicure with acrylics. The pedicure was great, but the manicure is awful. My nails look worse than cheap press ons and he didn't even touch my cuticles. I wanted to love this place, but I can't with these nails. I'm a student and I do better nails on my friends for practice and this is supposed to be professional.</review><response>None</response>< Rate>

I was frequenting this salon for a good 2 years then discontinued due to funds. But I came back because the old staff was always so great and treated me so well.  I called to see if anyone was avaliable for a full set of acrylics and the gentleman on the phone had a great response and personality and made me laugh. I walked in and was seated right away . I told the guy doing my nails what I wanted and sadly it was not what I got. He was very addiment about leaving early and got up in the middle of my set twice to eat food. He didnt wear a mask and blew sighs into my face which reeked. He Didnt say much but the nails were crooked, very lumpy and a terrible shape. Not almond, more like points. He didnt ask me once if they were ok but I'm also not a person to cause problems, I just shut up and let him finish due to frustration. On top of it all before one of the senior staff came back they were cussing up a storm. F this, F that with a shop full of ladies. Very unprofessional. Im not one to complain and want nothing out of my review im just very dissapointed in my nails. Also very dirty salon. Sad, I really loved this place. Had to go to another salon on the verge of tears and ask them to fix my nails.
If he had just take the time and effort to be more accurate and cared about his work they would have been fine. I will not be back. Sorry. I gave two stars for selection and reception service.<//text>

I'm obsessed with this salon! I got a powder color manicure on my natural nails and I'm in love with the color and durability. They literally have 300+ colors to choose from so you'll never get bored coming back :) I'll be back again for sure!< /text>

I was hesitant to go to a new place as I'm very picky about nails. ( wasn't able to go to my normal place due to medical emergency of the owner). I'm very pleased and happy with the way my nails were done. I will continue to go to Sky nails until my regular place opens back up. Would recommend 💅<//Review>

< review>
I had an appt at 11 for 2 manicures and didn’t get seated until 1145 and then the gal who did my nails rushed through the manicure in about 10 minutes and got very snippy and raised her voice when I told her the wrong polish number. I brought my mother for mother’s day and my moms nails didn’t get started until 12! We had plans after our nail appt and I’m very upset that I was treated poorly, had a rushed through manicure and had to wait so long. I understand you are a very busy establishment but for what I’m paying I expect better treatment and to take your time. Possibly don’t book so heavily so you have time for your clients. I’m very very disappointed and don’t think I’ll be returning.< /review>

Service was horrible. The lady doing my pedicure didn’t even ask what type of pedicure i wanted. She was acting like she didn’t want to do it. She cut my toe nails completely uneven and half polished my toes. I’ll never go back! The guy doing my nails shaped them uneven and did a design completely different from what i showed him. After i let him know it wasn’t what i want they both caught attitudes.</Text>

This was my first time getting my nails done, EVER. And the guy who did my nails was really rude and super short. They look nice enough, but they are definitely not exactly what I wanted. After he was done, he said to leave them in front of the fan(not telling me for how long) and then got up and walked away<//Text>

<Review>I am a regular customer at SkyNails. I tried many salons before choosing to stay at this salon.
I love these guys and have gotten to know them. As with most people,  be nice and friendly and the SkyNails group responds in kind.
Danny the owner runs a very good , clean salon with the newest pedicure chairs and equipment. They stock the newest colors in gels and polish. These are the best manicures and pedicures in town. The staff have always  been very kind and work hard to take good care of everyone. Wonderful acrylics, gels, mani'cures and pedicures.
The best times  to go are during the week and often in the daytime. Weekends are very busy and often booked  . Even though the spa is very busy they try to accommodate everyone.

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>To everyone who got a shoddy job done by a male here, request Tiffany. I'm super OCD about my nails, and she makes sure to get them perfect! I dont go to anywhere else. Not a fan of getting pedis there, but at least they're very good natured about how ticklish my feet are!</review>< Pics>

Nick is the best! He was super kind and helpful. He explained what was going on and how they were fixing things every step of the way; he really kept us in the loop. Nick really showed that he cared about our situation and looked for the best solution possible. We will definitely be asking for his help from now on if we have any plumbing issues or when we need to install any new items! 100/10 service!! Definitely use their services if you need!<//review>

Nicholas and his team were excellent.  My wife and I run a home business and operational restrooms are important.  They showed up earlier than expected and went the extra mile to stay late to resolve the issue same day.   Professional,  clean,  and timely!< /text>

<Review>Niko was training under Nicholas at the time of received service. They were both respectful and explained things in a way that I was able to understand. They provided feedback on how to avoid the issue as well as referrals for additional services to prevent the issue from happening again.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Had two clogged outdoor area drains.  Tech came out and worked to try to clear but was unsuccessful on both - did not have the proper tools - needed a hydrojet rig to clear the roots.  Still charged full price and said he would speak to his supervisor about scheduling a jet (at additional cost) but never heard back.  Complete waste of $554.  Tech was on time and courteous though.  If you have a clogged outdoor area drain, you will have better luck calling a local contractor - they will be cheaper, bring the right tools and have better success getting the line cleared; plus will run cameras down the line to let you know if there are any other issues.<//Review>

My husband and I appreciate the outstanding service work done by Steven & Art & are very appreciative to have them come out so quickly in the middle of the night to fix our plumbing issues. We had some trouble with Darwin at first and we’re a pretty upset, but this company definitely did what they had to do to make the situation better. We are very thankful and will definitely be using them again in request of the two gentleman Art and Steven. Very friendly, quick and know what they are doing.< /Review>

<Text>Our technician, Wesley, did an AMAZING job of fixing our plumbing issue!  He was on time, they called before they came, he was super friendly, and he knew his stuff.  He worked quickly and was super clean.  Our dishwasher was having problems where water was pouring into the sink from the air gap each time we ran the dishwasher.  He had to clean out the smelly disposal line, and he did a great job with it!  After he finished, he even ran a cycle to make sure it was not having water flowing out.  He cleaned up everything when he was done, and under my sink looks better than ever!  Super happy with my plumbing experience and Wesley.  I would definitely recommend him and Roto-Rooter.<//Text>< time>

He showed up much earlier that originally estimated.  When he was done he explained everything to me that was done and stuck a camera down the pipe for me to see that the drain was cleared.< /text>

Josh came out this time, arrived within an hour of calling on a Sunday, and cleared the back up quickly. Highly recommend calling these guys.

Tim was awesome. He explained all potential scenarios/costs clearly before he did anything. He could have easily told me it was going to take more, which would have cost more, but he was able to do the job at the lower quoted rate.

Second time I’ve called rotorooter, and I’m happy with service each time.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1583609676771, 'text': 'Thanks so much for calling us again to be of service, Matthew.

The plumber missed the window, but only by 20 minutes or so. Isaiah was excellent and professional, very personable. My only complaint would be that Roto-Rooter is almost twice as expensive as local plumbers and I would hesitate to use them in the future. That being said, if you need a good plumber to show up at your door same-day and handle the situation, they'll get it done.</Review>

Shane was able to fix a leaky pipe buried in a wall at the cement floor level without breaking any marble tiles.
I’m sure that he saved me a lot of money.
Great Job!<//text>< Pics>

Darwin Perez came to fix our drain. We are extremely pleased with his exceptional service. He fixed our drain quickly, explained to us why the clog problem developed, and showed us what we can do to prevent this in the future. We will request him again, specifically, should any other Roto-Rooter service be needed in our home. He did a fantastic job!<//text>

This was the second time this individual (didn’t catch his name) has helped us. He was out a year ago to fix an emergency pipe leak in bathroom #1 and did a fantastic job fixing it at 5am. We noticed a similar issues starting to happen in our bathroom #2, so instead of waiting for the emergency leak to happen, we called Roto Rooter to fix it before it got worse. The same man came out and fixed the probably in less than 30 minutes. He was very kind, professional, and followed social distancing procedures.< /text>

<review>When we called  Roto-Rooter the customer service rep was very nice and helpful and kept us up to date as to when the tech would arrive. John R was the technician that showed up. He was very helpful and informative the whole time. There were no hidden fees and he walked us through the process of what he was doing. Very clean, very nice, very knowledgeable.

Billy was awesome - 5 Stars.  Very professional, courteous and explained everything he was doing.  Roto-Rooter (the company) was good  - 3.5 stars.  I called around 1PM and got a service window of 4PM - 8PM.  Billy got here around 9:30PM.  Roto-Rooter did call twice to keep me in the loop and explain the delay.<//review>

We have been experiencing consistent plumbing issues after moving into our new home and Ezequiel R. has been our technician two of the three times we have had to call for plumbing services and he is AWESOME!  He is extremely professional, he is honest and goes out of his way to help to make sure your plumbing issues are resolved.  He is very courteous of being in your personal space and he has an extensive knowledge of plumbing.  He is the ONLY reason we will continue to use Roto Rooter for any plumbing issues moving forward.  The other technician we had out from Roto Rooter was extremely unprofessional and provided some of the worst service and customer service we have ever experienced.  Now we know that we can request specific technicians and moving forward we ill ALWAYS request to have Ezequiel R. help us with any plumbing issues.  He is awesome and we highly recommend him for any of your plumbing needs.<//Review>

Roto Rooter saves the day and our house. We had a clogged backyard drain and our yard was filling up with water fast. Roto Rooter came out that same day to resolve the issue. Mario and Art were great, trusting and very knowledgeable.</Text>

The technician Don Shipley was super thorough and explained everything to me before he did it. The faucet I had was going to be over $600 to replace, which was out of my price range, but Don found me a comparable replacement for half the price.

<rating>5<//rating><text>I had went to smile direct club back in February. I met with the sweetest person ever her name is Adrianna. We connected on a deep level. She was super generous, very accommodating and understanding. I met with other staff, but Adrianna blew me away with her generosity and character. She made me feel like I was making the right choice especially when I'm very insecure about my smile. I have to give Adrianna 5 stars! I wanted to do this review back in February, but I just kept pushing it sorry Adriana! Thank you for the best experience!

Whether you choose smile direct club, I do say you should check that out with your primary dentist first and have ur own personal X-rays because smile direct club don't actually do a deep x-ray they only get a good visual of your smile and not your jaw and beyond that which can be dangerous if  your smile needs a major fix. If its a minor fix like myself however, still get it checked out with your primary dentist check for cavities and see if smile direct club is for you.< /text>< Pics>

Adrianna was my smile guide at the San Diego location and she made it such a fun experience! She was very professional, knowledgeable & high spirited which was a super bonus for me! She made it easy to talk to her and open up about what I was looking for. Her vibes were high & she didn’t make me feel embarrassed about my teeth. She’s very down to earth and she created a whole experience that turned my bad day upside down and I left with a smile on my face! Thank you Adrianna for being such an amazing soul! Definitely go see her! Oh the lady in the office was really fun to talk to too! Great place!</review>

I really enjoyed this appointment. Honestly, Adrianna made it really easy. She explained the process very thoroughly and made sure she asked if I had any questions a couple times throughout the appointment. I particularly appreciate her joyful attitude and how easy it was for her to make me smile and laugh. She just made the whole thing enjoyable. The appointment took about 30 minutes and during that time, the whole program was explained and the scan/pictures of my teeth were taken. Very good experience!</Review>

From the text giving details on location & check-in...to Alison at the check-in desk...to Angelica as the tech providing great details on the program, executing their assessment protocols & ending with both Alison & Angelica ensuring all questions & comments are understood...whew! It was a blast! hahaha! That was better than an orthodontist or dentist exam!! Yes! I'm a believer!!< /Review>

<Text>Great experience overall. The staff was incredibly welcoming and accommodating upon entering the building. Nastasja Conducted my consultation and she was very kind, friendly, and thorough throughout the appointment. Payment options are flexible and I would say reasonable compared to competitors. The overall turnaround to get your entire package in the mail is only 2-3 weeks! I’m excited and I know a lot has to do from the incredible and knowledgeable team at the Point Loma location.</Text><time>1618523539122</time>< user_id>

While i entered the office, i was greeted by the front desk and directed me to the check-in location. Mr. Norman was nice helped me with the check in as he told me the wait to get in with the smile guide was going to be about 20 minutes which i was ok with He reach me back as soon as there were openings.

The Smile Guide Nastasja was really nice and told me everything i needed to know.

THANK YOU ALL FOR A GREAT EXPERIENCE!!</text>

The staff were super nice and took the time to answer all of my questions. I genuinely felt like they were excited for my son which made it hard for him not to be excited. Traditional braces...why? My daughter's traditional braces cost more than 3 times as much and had so many downsides in comparison to what Smile Direct Club offers. Traditional braces are a thing of the past, this is the future, no doubt. I just wish this was available when both of my daughters got braces!< /Text>

Anngelina was so great. This was my second visit and she was very professional and helpful just as I remembered. I'm lazy with writing reviews and rating but she definitely deserves the 5 star🌟
During my first visits they had a lot of appointments and 2 people called out but she was running the show and still made sure to explain all the steps and let me know what to expect.
Second time around she remembered me and asked about my day and made sure to go the extra mile and make me feel confident about the plan again. She is a true asset to your company.
Dealing with customer service over the phone I was a bit disappointed but of course she changed my mind.
Great experience there I will definitely put them back on my referrals list again.< /Text>

<Review>Great experience. My Smile Guide Nastasja was knowledgeable and friendly. I recommend going to a SmileShop for a free 3D scan of your teeth rather than doing your own teeth impression because there is no chance of making a mistake with the 3D scan. Setup your appointment on the website so you can take advantage of specials. My appointment came with a free teeth whitening pen and a bright on light.</Review>< pictures>

NEGATIVE 5 star! I’ve been waiting for my refund for 5 months now. They keep telling me to wait 5-10days and they will get back to you but never did. 5-10days could last years of waiting. Be warn Don’t ever think about going to smile direct club to fix you teeth.<//Review>

They make orthodontics simpler and less expensive!! A fixed rate of $1950 that includes everything you need. Really great option!

You can either get the materials sent to your house or set an appointment online. If you go for the second one, you go to their offices and get a mold of your teeth done and then a doctor sees you to decide which materiales you'll need, and the company ships everything to your house.  You don't need to go back to their offices, maybe just email pictures of your progress when they ask you to.< /text>

<Review>GO TO AN ACTUAL ORTHODONTIST! Yes, it is more expensive, but after reading dozens and dozens of complaints about SDC causing problems with people's mouths and NBC even investigated them, hard pass. Invest in your health, invest in your smile. It is not worth the risk. I will say that this office is super clean and the staff is super friendly. I am sorry y'all wasted your time with me. I do like SDC's whitening kit and their tooth brush is nice.<//Review>< pics>

I was helped by Luisiana and she was awesome! Very friendly, answered all my questions and made me feel very comfortable. I used to have braces but my teeth have moved over the years and Luisiana showed me using a 3D scan how my teeth look currently then explained the process step-by-step.  I’m very excited about getting that perfect smile! The appointment set up was fast and easy. Very responsive. Highly recommend to anyone who is thinking about braces.< /text>

So quick and easy to have my 3D scan! Lucy was so amazing at explaining the process and extremely knowledgeable about everything I asked. (I had some concerns as I spent 5 years in braces with some big orthodontic problems as a teen)The orthodontist only took one day to approve my aligners!  I’m so excited to get rid of the crowding and gapping that has happened sense the loss of my retainers 10 years ago.<//review>

Today we came in for a consultation appointment for my 16 year old daughter.  Super clean office, everyone were professional from checking in to sitting down with the consultant to 3D scanning.   In and out within 30 minutes, so much easier, more efficient, than when I was getting my Invisalign  a few years ago.< /review>

Smile direct is a scam. Customer service is not good at all. Hidden fees at every turn. Don’t try to save money by going this route. You’ll regret it. All of the work you put in to fix your teeth with be for nothing. Thanks for nothing, Smile Direct! 0/10 will be absolutely telling all of my friends to avoid this place!< /Text>

Amazing experience!  If you’re worried about covid this facility does an amazing job as far as cleanliness and proper protocols go.  Lucy was very professional and did an amazing job at explaining the process and doing the 3D scans of my teeth.  Would recommend smile direct and this location in particular to everyone!<//Text>

<review>Everyone there is really nice and explained everything! No pressure took my 3D pictures simple fast and painless. Even during these time still very nice and friendly. I watched them constantly wipe and santize stuff down with customers and after. They even wipe and santize after each use of there own stuff that they are assigned too. Facemasks and shilds were worn whole time with the staff. They also wore gloves when handling everything and changed them out between customers.</review>< Pictures>

I came in for a scan and was greeted as soon as I stepped in. A lady checked me in with a grand smile and walked me through what I should expect then had me sit in the waiting room. I waited for less than 5 minutes when Lucy came in and started giving me a more in depth explanation of how the treatment works, what the box includes, and just a general overview of everything. She also conversed with me for a bit in a natural way that made me feel very at ease. Overall it was a great experience and I would recommend anyone to check it out.</Text>

I want to thank Lucy for being so kind and providing all the knowledge I need to get ready for my new smile. I originally ordered the at home kit but felt as if I wanted to go into the office to make sure everything was done correctly. Lucy did a great job at this and made me feel so comfortable. She answered all my questions and made sure I left feeling excited for my new smile. I can't wait to receive my aligners in the mail soon and start the process to a brand new smile. Thank you Lucy and SmileDirectClub team!</Review>

From the moment I walked in with my daughter, I knew we had made the correct choice.  The welcome we received made us feel very comfortable.  The office had a very nice vibe, calm and professional.  Our rep Norman was great!  He made the process so easy and was very knowledgeable and understanding of our questions.  My daughter can't wait to get started with her new smile!  This is so exciting !  I can't wait to get mine also !<//text>

My Smile Direct technician & manager were wearing a face shield, mask & gloves and sanitized everything. Lucy was very friendly and professional. She explained each step and took her time.  She answered my questions.  She was skilled in conducting the 3D scan in a proficient manner. Overall, l was impressed by the customer service l received.</review>

Experience was good except for the receptionist or girl who greeted us. Had an attitude, we had an appointment and she said "well it's still an hour wait" with a rude tone. Luckily we wont have to deal with her again. Did not feel comfortable or appreciated.< /Text>

Employees are knowledgeable about aligners. Marla helped me out by getting me started. If you know anyone who has gotten aligners from smile direct definitely ask them for a referral code to save you $100 and give them $100.<//Review>

This has been the most frustrating experience I've had in a long time. I chose Smile Direct because I travel extensively and needed something that was easy and didn't require a ton of dentist visits. Big mistake. Long story short, I had to get four (4) different sets of trays because the system wasn't straightening my teeth correctly. Each time required a new scan (twice) or impressions (twice due to COVID). Each submission took at least 2 months to process. That's 8 wasted months. Their customer service is completely unhelpful. I am now a year into this and still no end in sight. This is a terrible service and I regret using them. If I could get a refund I would switch immediately to Invisilign or someother service. Even braces would have been better than this!!</Text>

I really can’t say enough about my experiences with my direct club and especially this location.  I have been to this location twice the first time for my free 3-D smile scan, after which I started my smile direct treatment and my teeth look excellent, smile direct club has always answered all my questions and the change in my smile was quick and drastic.  The shipping box which you receive when you start your treatment is really cool, it comes with all your aligners and the best whitening system I’ve ever used.  Smile direct club payment plan has no credit check and it’s such an easy process.

All of the staff at the smile direct club B St. location in San Diego are amazing.  Allison the store manager is extremely professional, genuine, courteous, and thorough.  Norman who did my 3-D smile scan is also extremely professional, knowledgeable, genuine, and answered all my questions and it shows that he and Allison both have a passion for helping people make their smiles better.  When I was in the shop yesterday Norman even reminded me that it was Valentine’s Day today LOL as I had forgotten.

The 3-D smile scan process is quick, easy, and painless, within a few days you get the projected outcome after your treatment is done with cool 3-D graphics, they always have great deals and the whole process is A++++.  Don’t hesitate and book an appointment at the B St. location San Diego and you won’t regret it.< /text>

I had a really nice experience with my 3D scan.  The staff was super friendly - all of them. The appointment took about 45 minutes total.  My teeth were scanned with a little handheld machine and the image appeared on the monitor. Next step - wait for my aligners to arrive!  Some may want the in-person experience but I love that this should be my only in-office appointment.< /Text>

Smile Direct Club has good marketing. The text based reminder system is impressively well polished. The iPad application they use to collect information was good except for two issues. One part had a date picker that didn’t let you change the month unless you change the year first which was non-intuitive. I’m a software engineer who makes user interfaces like these for a living and I couldn’t figure out how to make it work without assistance. The other issue was that in several places, you were expected to enter date information with the touch pad, which was very clunky. I’ve never seen any software attempt to collect date information this way.

A blond woman who I assume was the general manager seemed slightly disgruntled, which seemed out of place with the customer focused image the company is trying to project, but I didn’t have to interact with her much.

The biggest issue I have to report about my experience was the demeanor of the technician who did my scan. I’m not the sort of person who requires or even likes a sappy contrived customer service persona, but I can safely say that her demeanor isn’t appropriate for a public facing role. She’d ask if I had questions, and then seemed impatient about answering them.  From the very beginning of the process, she made me feel like she didn’t like me and felt contempt towards me. I didn’t take it personally because I knew I hadn’t done anything to elicit this kind of response, but it still felt weird.</Text>

<Text>Their website explains it all, and I figured there was more that I’d learn at the appointment. The only surprise I got was that I could straighten both my top and bottom teeth for the same price!  Plus, right now they have a $100 coupon on their site. The visit took longer than 30 minutes, but Nataja took the time to answer all my questions and didn’t make me feel rushed, even though I was the last appointment of the day. Laughing and being silly with Nataja was a great end to my work week!  FIVE stars for the first part of the process.  I’ll post another review when I get my aligners. So far I’m very impressed!< /Text>< user_name>

<review>Lucy was very nice, not pushy at all and extremely clean (even for post Covid-19 standards). I went in knowing I wanted aligners so I made it easy but she was available to answer any further questions I had.< /review>< Rating>

Smile Direct Club has good marketing. The text based reminder system is impressively well polished. The iPad application they use to collect information was good except for two issues. One part had a date picker that didn’t let you change the month unless you change the year first which was non-intuitive. I’m a software engineer who makes user interfaces like these for a living and I couldn’t figure out how to make it work without assistance. The other issue was that in several places, you were expected to enter date information with the touch pad, which was very clunky. I’ve never seen any software attempt to collect date information this way.

A blond woman who I assume was the general manager seemed slightly disgruntled, which seemed out of place with the customer focused image the company is trying to project, but I didn’t have to interact with her much.

The biggest issue I have to report about my experience was the demeanor of the technician who did my scan. I’m not the sort of person who requires or even likes a sappy contrived customer service persona, but I can safely say that her demeanor isn’t appropriate for a public facing role. She’d ask if I had questions, and then seemed impatient about answering them.  From the very beginning of the process, she made me feel like she didn’t like me and felt contempt towards me. I didn’t take it personally because I knew I hadn’t done anything to elicit this kind of response, but it still felt weird.</Text>

I came into the office not knowing what to expect besides what I've read on the website, which was pretty helpful and informative on it's own, and I was extremely pleased with how kind and helpful the receptionist and my smile guide, Jordan, were throughout the entire experience. Jordan was very knowledgeable and respectful the entire time. She even taught me some stuff regarding my own teeth that I didn't know about. I will be recommending Smile Direct Club to all my friends and family.<//review>

<Review>Had a great experience with my visit! From start to finish the staff made it very simple and comfortable to start my smile journey. They send you a comprehensive text that reiterates your appointment time and how to get to the storefront with pictures and all (as it resides in a building with a multitude of other places), they also have a private parking garage which doesn't cost anything once your ticket is validated.  Upon arrival they check you in and immediately make you feel welcome. I had Bianca as my smile guide and she was great at explaining their process every step of the way. She was very pleasant to work with as she was in a joyful mood and made me feel very secure about my smile concerns. Can't wait to get my aligners in a few weeks!</Review>< pics>

<text>Had such a great experience at this location! Nastasja was amazing, she was friendly and professional! She explained every step of the way and made it look easy. I wouldn’t say my teeth were bad to begin with but I have a front gap that I never really had a problem with nor did it bother me until I got engaged. Then thinking of our big day and all of the pictures and videos, it became known to me that I wanted to fix it. Going in for my appointment  i was unsure if I’d go through with it or not. Nastasja was very helpful and understanding that I went for it! I don’t regret my decision! I would recommend friends, family and anyone to this location!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><GmapID>0x80d954a6fee55555:0x57d720b19c1efcf3< /GmapID><time>1582115511056< /time><username>Nayeli Davila</username></record></dataset><record>

Before coming in I did a bunch of research on this company, looked up so many reviews, and I saw a lot of positive things. So I followed through with signing up for an appointment. Jordan helped me out! She’s very easy to talk to, friendly, and very helpful! It was nice to see that she also uses their products. The appointment experience was very quick and easy! In the 30 mins Jordan thoroughly went over the whole process, did the scan (which the scan was also very cool to watch and see how your teeth look like close up), and went over any questions and concerns I had. If you’re iffy, I recommend setting up an appointment and checking out the smile shop first! They are very helpful and are there to answer any questions you have!< /Text>

Was thinking of adjusting the positioning and spacing of my teeth for a while now so I went to see SmileDirect Club. As soon as I got to their, facilities they were very welcoming. Getting checked in was simple and fast. The process of scanning my teeth was so quick. I was in and out. Did not feel pressure to act immediately for signing up. Lucy was the dental professional I worked with and she was great! Very gentle with the whole process. I definitely recommend these guys if you are thinking about doing the braces thing.<//review>

<Review>The process is simple and relatively quick.  Everyone there was very friendly and welcoming.  I didn't have to wait more than about 2 minutes in the waiting room which is unheard of for an doctor/dentist/etc office.

Karen was my "smile guide"  -  she was fantastic and did a great job of explaining everything about the appointment and what to expect next.  She and Jordan ensured that when I was walking out of there that I had all the information that I needed and all of my questions had been adequately answered.  Thank you!</Review>< pictures>

I went and got a scan. I was greeted by Nataly who was very nice. My smile guide Bianca was great! Lucy did a good job checking my scan and making sure everything was great before sending it to the Dr. Everyone in the shop was very welcoming. I can't wait to start my treatment and have a new smile.<//Review>

Lucy was amazing! Such a kind lady that made the entire 3D scan process an enjoyable process. It was a little awkward finding the Smile Direct office as it's within a WeWork compound but the inside of the Smile Direct office was very welcoming. Check-in was a breeze and I was meeting with Lucy in less than 3-4 minutes. She was very nice and asked me a ton of questions to get a good idea of who I was and why I was there. She answered all of my questions and addressed any of my concerns with easy. The 3D Scan of my teeth was AMAZING. I have only ever seen my teeth in photos and mirrors so to actually see a 3D rendering was very cool. I didn't end up signing up for Smile Direct but am seriously considering it. It is definitely cheaper than traditional braces but it's still a decent chunk of money for something that I personally consider to be a WANT vs a NEED. Even though I didn't sign up for the Smile Direct program, Lucy continued to be very kind and professional. I may change my mind in the coming weeks but that is TBD.< /Text>

< review>
Finding the location was a bit tricky for me since I am literally the worst at following directions. But once inside, the process was pretty streamlined. I was greeted by someone at the entrance who got me setup. I waited for maybe less than 10 minutes, and even while i waited, they checked on me and told me how much longer it would be til i was ready to be seen. I met with Karen, who was literally the nicest person. And i was full of questions and she answered them all without hesitation. They double checked their work when my consult with Karen was done and they even explained how they could use my care credit (saved some money!). I overall enjoyed my experience and i was COMFORTABLE,  which is what i feel is most importance when you're dealing with something that is as sensitive as your smile.  GOOD JOB KAREN :)< /review>

<review>Our visit to Smile Direct Club was a very relaxed and friendly experience! From the moment we walked in the door, we were greeted with smiles and courtesy. I never had to ask any questions because everything was explained to me very clearly and with detail. Jordan was especially nice and helpful during our exactly 30-minute visit! She performed the 3D scan without any delays and explained what she was doing the whole time. We never felt rushed or confused at any time. It was an overall 5-star experience!< /review>< Pictures>

I usually hate doing anything involving my teeth, but Jordan and the amazing team there helped me feel as comfortable as possible. Conversations felt like ones you had with long lost friends. And at every moment of the quick process they would help explain what and why they were doing what they were doing so you are never in the dark.Thanks for the amazing service and I can’t wait to see my smile !</Text>

Had a great visit with the Smile Direct Club today in downtown! I believe the wonderful lady helping me was Karen! Made me feel very welcomed and made sure I wasn’t left out in the blue about anything! Can’t wait to get my box of goodies to start getting my smile together<//Review>

Absolutely impressed! That's all I kept thinking from the time I walked in. The Smile Direct location in San Diego is great! They really did a great job with the atmosphere! Everyone was very welcoming and very professional. Megan helped me with my 3-D scan and answered all my questions. She was very friendly and helpful from the second I arrived. If anyone is considering Smile Direct I would highly recommend stopping by the San Diego location for your free consultation.<//Text>

This place was so awesome! I got lost, and called and was helped step by step to get here. Even though I was late, I was taken right away and greeted so happily by everyone I met. I was helped by Alexis, and she is the sweetest girl ever! So helpful and really made everything clear and easy. The store is so clean and modern and has a fantastic vibe. This is the coolest thing I’ve ever done for my teeth! I highly highly recommend coming in, it was such an amazing experience!</Text>

What an amazing experience. From the moment I walked into the office I was greeted by Jimmy and after I was checked in i was brought to the office. He made me feel comfortable and was well versed in the product and made the process that much easier. He was able to answer all my questions without any hesitation. I would recommend Smile Direct to all my friends and family. Thanks to Jimmy I’ll have a better smile!</Review>

This place was super cool! I'm going to be a honest, it was a little hard to find and get to but once you're there it's awesome. The staff is super friendly; you can tell they really like their jobs. Four stars only because it took them a few minutes to come out and get me from the waiting area. However, the process itself was fast. The worker, Marla, who scanned my teeth was ultra friendly and made me feel at ease! I want to go back just to see the cool office building again (you'll see what I mean when you get there).<//review>

<Text>Although I had braces as a teenager, I noticed that my teeth had shifted a bit since (probably because I hadn’t worn my retainer). A friend of mine recommended I try Smile Direct Club. It was easy to make an appointment online for a 3-D scan. When I walked in I was greeted by a friendly representative, promptly checked in, and taken in to meet my smile representative, Alexis. She was very upbeat and welcoming. The entire process took 20 minutes...no waiting, painless, and affordable. Awesome experience!</Text>< Pics>

So impressed!!  I was a walk in, only had to wait 10 min.  Marla was very professional and personable.  I felt very comfortable to understand the expected process.  It's affordable and so efficient!  The 3D smile scan is pretty awesome.  Hope this works!

Fyi, wish I knew it beforehand, but they'll validate parking under the building.</review>

<review>Although I had braces as a teenager, I noticed that my teeth had shifted a bit since (probably because I hadn’t worn my retainer). A friend of mine recommended I try Smile Direct Club. It was easy to make an appointment online for a 3-D scan. When I walked in I was greeted by a friendly representative, promptly checked in, and taken in to meet my smile representative, Alexis. She was very upbeat and welcoming. The entire process took 20 minutes...no waiting, painless, and affordable. Awesome experience!<//review>< Pics>

I was hesitant at first to make an appointment because of questions about the procedure. I have a cross bite (tooth behind my other teeth) and the appointment experience was great. The scan was very easy and Marla made me feel very comfortable and was able to answer all of my questions I had about losing a tray and time it would be to receive them in the mail. I hope I get approved and be able to start my journey to straighter teeth. Thank you!<//review>

<review>Came down from NorCal to visit family and decided to get a scan booked to see if I am a good candidate for invisible aligners.Upon booking my free scan online, I instantly got an email with my confirmation and right after I got an email with specific direction on how to park and access the building and offices. It was really easy to get there and upon arrival they checked me in right away and within minutes I was with one of their reps. I met with Alexis who was very professional and sweet. I didn’t know what to expect and she clarified everything for me. I had questions about insurance and about having to return to do any kind of follow-ups. Once she answers all my questions she went over everything that was going to be coming in the mail and how it all works. Then we started the scan. First she took pictures of my teeth and then after began the scan process. Everything took about 25 min and then I was on my way. It was so fast and interesting at the same time. I got to see my teeth in 3D, it was an awesome experience and I recommend everyone go do the scan instead of the trays. I am glad I decided to do my scan there. If you have a chance do it I hope you get staff as knowledgeable and thorough as Alexis! Thanks again Alexis, you were sweet and amazing and I appreciate you being so patient and thorough! Can’t wait to start my path to my new smile! :)</review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1532032410470, 'text': "Wow! We're honored that you took the time to share this with us.

My visit with jordan was very informational and didn’t take very long. She was very interactive with me as far as explaining how the process goes and how the appointment would go. Jordan made sure I had all the information I needed for me to be able to do the at home kit myself with no questions. She’s great and definitely lived up to that 5 star rating.< /review>

Awesome customer service and no waiting time! I had an issue with the tray to my impressions kit not capturing my back molars so I decided to make an appointment to get my scan done in person. I made the appointment an hour before the appointment time and was accommodated flawlessly. The parking was validated and the service staff was incredibly welcoming and attentive. I can’t think of a better first experience and am very excited to start treatment. Thank you Nataly and Megan for taking such great care of me. Would 100% recommend going to a club if you have the option to. Such an great way to get alternative treatment to traditional braces or more expansive name brand aligners.

Today I went to smiledirect club and had the best experience with Jordan! She was so easy to talk to and made me feel at ease immediately! She answered every single one of my questions. And the process seems very simple. There were two forms of photographing your teeth. One was a 3D scanner as well as photos for my “before” shots. I was sent home with a whitening kit too! Overall great experience I would definitely recommend giving this a shot. Thank you Jordan!<//text>

From the ease of onsite parking, to the polite staff, the whole process was pleasant and streamlined.
Jordan was very helpful in explaining how we would get through the scan and what steps to follow at home.
It’s amazing what technological advances have done to dentistry.</review>

Took my son to SmileDirect and it was an amazing experience. The manager Allison and staff assistant Lucy were very welcoming, helpful, and professional. The vibe that SmileDirect has created is very comforting and open. The information about the product and the program exceeded my expectations. And you really can’t beat the price or the people that work at SmileDirect. I highly recommend giving SmileDirect a chance instead of a regular orthodontist. We’re excited to see the end results!!<//Review>

< review>
Not my first rodeo. I have had braces from 12yo to 15yo for a severe overbite. Headgear as well. Kids are cruel, having been called all the names in the book.

Smile Direct Club Simply... total WOW!!!
Quick in and out; 30 min.

Traditional Dentist (TD) vs. Smile Direct Club (SDC)
TD: 40 min wait, over booking.    |      SDC: 4 min wait.
TD: Chair Time 30/45 min.          |      SDC: 15 max.
TD: Repeat Apt many.                   |      SDC: Zero.
TD: Dental Dam & Pain.                |      SDC: Zero.
TD: Protocol Scam.                       |      SDC: Zero.
TD: Cost $$$$.                               |      SDC: 1/3 of TD.

Keep in mind that it’s none evasive realignment of your teeth. It’s Cosmetic and may not be covered by most insurances, out of pocket WITH a payment plan.
Or save up for one lump sum payment, less than the payment plan.

You have nothing to loose for the FREE 3-D scan and dentist evaluation, other than 30 min of your time. I was told directly... 95% Customer Satisfaction Rating.

Total WoW!!!</review>

<Text>Lucy at the DT San Diego office was absolutely amazing. The way she explained the process and details was professional and accurate. We were concerned with a few things in regards to possible problems and Lucy was so great at answering the concern or getting the answer before we left.

<review>My appointment here was wonderful from start to finish! Jordan was my smile guide and she did a fantastic job explaining everything and overall made me feel 100% confident with the process. The 3D scan was incredible and made me excited about the level of technology they are using for the aligners. Nataly did my quality check and insured everything was perfect before we where done. Everyone in the shop was very professional and greeted me with a handshake and a smile, overall would highly recommend choosing SmileDirectClub to straighten your teeth.</review><Rate>5</Rate><pictures>None<//pictures>< Time>

<rate>5</rate><Review>San Diego location.Friendly Staff and impressive work space. I have been thinking about fixing my smile for awhile. I had invisalign when I was younger and did not keep up with my retainer over the years. So I have an idea of how this works. I dont feel that I need an orthodontist appointment every 2 weeks, and thought I would try "Smile Direct". I made the appointment online late the night before and was a little worried the office receiving my request for 9:30am the next morning. That was put at ease when i received a text msg a few minutes later confirming my appt time and even got a follow up text in the morning giving me the address and a link for detailed instructions for parking. (not hard and very thorough ). The office is in WeWorks building which is a trendy shared work space.  Check in was easy and simple. I was taken to meet with Alexis who went over the process of the 3D scan and how SmileDirect works. The cost is very clear, its even on their website. No hidden fees (yet).  I was disappointed to learn that it will take 5-6 weeks to receive my trays but other then that I was not disappointed and  had a great first impression of Smile Direct and hope everything goes as planned.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMqCm7873waYVXagmvtaKsstKdupoOYuOjBLyLJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

The whole process was easy!  Jordan thoroughly explained everything, and even though we were her last appointment of the day she was patient and kind to us.  I’ll update this as we’ll see if the aligners work.  The only issue we had was the whitener thing they gave us didn’t work (just wouldn’t turn on), not sure if it was broken.  We’ll call on Monday to see if we can get a replacement.</review>

<text>Nataly was excellent, she saw me immediately and helped to get me checked in. The scan of my teeth was very quick and efficient, I was even given a teeth whitening kit at the end.

Also, the office is on the 3rd floor. Take a left after you get off of the elevator then take a right and go down the hall.<//text>< response>

Lucy was very friendly and answered all my questions, the 4 stars is because my teeth are not that jacked up, I had braces before but didn’t wear my retainers and have noticed a shift and want to correct it, however it’s 1 price for everyone no matter if it takes 3 months to correct or 6. Which if I do the math correctly that 3 months of materials they wouldn’t have to provide so I feel there should be some sort of price differential.<//Review>< rating>

Meeting Alexis and the rest of the Smile Direct club team was honestly the best dental experience I have ever had. I am a little bummed that I will only have to go there once because everyone on their staff was so fun, sweet, and accommodating. The experience beats having to get a mold of your teeth, this was super high tech, and easy. The price is a lot better than what I expected and I would definitely recommend them to everyone I know :) Thank you Smile Direct Club of San Diego <3</review>

Today I went into smile direct club with my friend for his consult. We were helped by Maria. I love how the office was set up and the process is so easy (and affordable) I am actually considering getting myself a set of straighteners. Maria was very friendly and knowledgeable.<//text>

They where diligent in answering my calls and changing my original scheduled time at no charge and no hassle. When I walked in it was a quick and painless introduction and filled out some info on an iPad that was less than 2 minutes. I was offered waters for me and my son and waited in the lobby for maybe 5 minutes before seeing a dental assistant. They went over all of the info and answered any questions I had. They took the 3D photos of my mouth which took about 10 minutes. I signed up for a treatment plan(had a choice of two) and was on my way to a new smile! Jimmy was my Dental assistant and was super helpful and very professional and knowledgeable on treatments and couldn’t have done a better job.<//Review>

Great experience, fast and professional service.

Hint: Park under the building in the garage, they will validate your parking during your appointment.

Bianca walked me through everything and answered any questions my wife and I had. Entire appt took us less than an hour and I walked out with an entire plan for treatment.

My appointment was April 3rd and my entire treatment box (all aligners)  arrived yesterday (April 15th)

6 months and I’ll be all done!

Thank you Bianca for a great experience!</text>

This place was great. I actually had an appointment a week later, but they were very accommodating and did my scanning right then. Everyone was super friendly and made me very comfortable. Alexis, my Smile Guide (dental assistant), was super stellar with a smile to match. Looking forward to the results.</review>

I haven’t even yet received my box and I’m already sold. They team treated me so kindly and made the whole experience (which is really intimidating) very comfortable. Marla (who helped me) was so sweet to me and explained everything to a tee. I am excited for the email and to begin my journey. Also, props to the marketing team on the comp tote bag and  whitening treat to get started. Ps. The offices are so cute!< /Review>

The visit was very professional, polite and not too pushy.   There were a couple direct "sales nudges".  I am impressed that they helped with my insurance coverage questions.  We were able to do it in the moment, and without any hesitation of the SDC agent.  With this I needed a CPT code.  The SDC agent was right on it.  She got me the information.  I found out that my insurance will cover most all!  Terrific news.  Hat's off to the SDC agent.  Well done.</Text>

i came into the place and they greeted me right away and then i sat for only a few minutes (i was early) to wait for my appointment and then Jordan introduced herself to me and we immediately got to talking about what i want to fix with my teeth and she broke down the whole process of the entire treatment and then she scanned my teeth and took pictures. it was so simple and so easy and so much less expensive and time consuming as regular dentist appointments!< /Review>

I was in today getting a 3D scan and also ready to sign up to do something about my teeth! Alexis was genuinely kind, charismatic, and I felt more than comfortable with all the staff I had met or interacted with. My appt was at 1030a and it really made a difference in how the rest of my day was going to be- fantastic! Thanks for the help, guys! Was great to meet and chat with all of you, too.< /Review>

I signed up for Smile Direct Club (SDC) in June, which was financed through HFD. SDC sent my aligners ONLY for my top teeth stating that they were unable to make aligners for my bottom teeth. If they told me that, I would have simply cancelled then and there. But I was under the impression that I would get a FULL smile makeover because after all, my 3D photo images showed me the before and after of BOTH. NOT JUST THE TOP. Oh any by the way, I was gonna pay the same as someone else who got a top and bottom. I cancelled the account, sent back the aligners and received a refund of $250 from SDC. They said that they would cancel my account with HFD. I sent emails to HFD with attachments of my correspondence with SDC asking them to ensure my account with them was cancelled too. They emailed me back saying that my "account would be placed on hold until they could confirm my cancellation within a couple of weeks".  Needlesstosay that HFD drafted my account and I had to file a dispute with my bank. Now more than a month after my cancellation, I got a NOTICE OF PAYMENT DUE in the mail! Is this a joke?!? I have all the correspondence and evidence I need if HFD wants to take a legal route. I've never had such poor customer service in my life! I will never do business with HFD.  This is the most unprofessional, inefficient, and incompetent company I've ever had to deal with! EVER! SDC should do better for their customers! I would never recommend them either!< /Text>

{'time': 1565276170870, 'text': "Thanks for leaving us a review, Lani. All customers are sent their SmilePlan prior to treatment, which will show the projected movement and results. Whether the treatment is for one or two arches, the same amount of care and effort goes into creating the plan, having it approved, creating and shipping the aligners, and providing the same quality care to all customers. Once an order is cancelled, it's up to HFD to make the cancellation on their end, but we're more than happy to assist with this. Please email us at grinners@smiledirectclub.com so that we can look into this further. Best, Madison"}<//response>

<user_id>113350310993722887388<//user_id><user_name>Trevor Zelinski<//user_name><text>Worst customer service. Emails from them have no information, just links to refer people and requests to write "glowing" reviews. When you log into your dashboard after completing treatment, it's almost as if you've never been a customer. Everything gets wiped out and they treat you like a potential new customer again. It's bizarre.

Adding to original review following response:
Your only response of directing me to your customer service to solve a multitude of issues , one of which is the fact that you have horrible customer service, shows not only that do you not care to actually fix anything but that you're also clueless.

UPDATE:
Here I am...4 weeks after ordering my replacement retainers and they still have not arrived! The email confirmation clearly states, "You should expect to receive them in 2-3 weeks." Incredibly frustrating. Can't wait to see how their customer service handles this.<//text><Rate>1<//Rate><GmapID>0x80d954a6fee55555:0x57d720b19c1efcf3< /GmapID>< pictures>

I went in for a scan and was told I wouldn’t be charged anything... that they just wanted to put my card on file for when I approved the treatment plan. Well, not two days later I was sent an email saying that I’d been charged and my order is on the way. Either I got scammed at the scan place ( Thanks Alexis :( ) or this company just likes to submit fraudulent charges without customer approval.</review>

I called to speak with a manager to wait on the phone for 30 minutes. The manager was Diego and did not give me his full names as he obviously had something to hide. I went through the Invisalign’s they provided and it did not work. My teeth moved slittly after 5 months, but they promised it would fix my gaps as they fell very short of doing so. To make matters worse aside from the costumer service and my teeth not being as they said they would, the Invisalign’s broke multiple times from me trying to put them on my teeth. I’m writing this review to help others from this terrible company and product.<//Review>

I am looking forward to receive it at home and start seeing the amazing results!!! Very happy to have found you! it's the perfect product for those who want, like me, align their smile but travel a lot and have no time for dentist's appointments, as monthly appointments are not required with Smile Direct and everything can be monitored and personalized thru the app with your doctor.

SmileDirect is actually the worst thing ever!!!! I ordered mine in the end of May and didn’t get it till a month almost 2 months later.

They only sent me the top arch for my order and said they can’t fix the bottom one but still charged me 2k for it with out saying anything I called to ask about it and they said there’s nothing they can do so I requested to cancel the services. After I requested a cancellation they offer to take $200 off to fix the top arch after saying there’s nothing they can do.
So ask to cancel it, they never call me back and charge me for another’s payment I called them 3 more times to only get a adress to ship my stuff back end up paying $35 for shipping also.
After 2 weeks shipping it back they never call me if after they received the item so I again have to call them.

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER !

I suggest get regular braces< /Review>

<Review>I booked my appointment for July 13, 2018 and got an e-mail and sms confirmation in an instant. The representative named Allison greeted us right outside smiledirectclub’s shop and took care of our parking validation ticket. I confirmed my email address and I was brought to a waiting area where Marla  the super nice and friendly dental assistant met me and led me to the 3D scanning area. She was so helpful and was so informative every time I asked her any questions about the treatment. The process was so quick and easy everything went well after another worker named Natalie checked all my dental 3D scans and photos. She was also helpful when she texted me about parking underground the building so you don’t have to worry about looking for a parking at all! And it’s for free! Marla gave me a package of LED accelerator light + whitening pen to brighten my smile 😀...I can’t wait to use it! It’s compatible with my iPhone or iPad...or my husband’s Android...Anyway, shoutout to the staff at smiledirectclub San Diego especially to Marla for making me feel at ease and welcome at their smile shop! 👍🏼 I give this place a 5 star ⭐️ for all of the reasons above. P.S. I love business establishments that offers beverages especially in this summer heat...they offered and I politely declined 😸...</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Buyer beware!  This is a risky approach to straightening your teeth!  I now need gum surgery and mayloose teeth if the gum specialist cant help me. I didnt know thwy dont use an orthodontist to know if there are problema before the teethmove. My bite is now all off and i need gum surgery...what a nightmare!
