Friendly and pleasant staff. I'd recommend reservations, online. Indoor and outdoor seating are available, beautiful atmosphere.
They have a nice wine and cocktail selection but no blender drinks.
The menu has a nice selection and our meals (Steak and Lobster) were prepared by Chef Lacy,
the medium rare fillet was perfect through out. Risotto was so flavorful and the mushrooms perfectly.
Chef Lacy was very cordial and enhanced my meal experience with a personal visit at the table.
Enjoyable live music was relaxing.  The overal ambiance was family friendly, quiet and private.< /Review>

<Review>Friendly welcoming staff. Reservations recommended online. Indoor outdoor seating. Lovely wine and cocktail selection. Not so busy visit was during happy hour. Perfect timing to get in and out for dinner and discount.  Menu is pricey but worth it. Our dishes were so delicious cooked to perfection. Very nice winery vibe. Beautiful dining furniture and setup. Covid-19 friendly. Parking lot available. Wouldn't have known this place existed because of location.<//Review><username>just fee< /username><gmap_id>0x80900dc08cf3eb61:0x85379e7db32aabd0</gmap_id></record>

<text>A very lovely resturant however, even with a reservation had to wait an inordinate time to be seated. We waited...to have our orders taken and waited....and waited.....until I finally asked for my soup before any food showed up. I believe the server failed to put in the order. Everyone was served separately, food not served as ordered, items missing and specific directions not followed. It had been an hour before we all got our food. The server compt our meal 20% but would rather have had prompt good service. Great soup, sandwich was ok.<//text>< pics>

Good upscale restaurant. Food and service was very good. They do have a table in the kitchen for larger groups. Ambiance was a little bright in the dining room (especially if you are looking for a romantic setting), but outside patio sitting would be the place if you were looking for a romantic setting. I will return to try other menu items.<//text>

< Review>
First visit to this restaurant. I was with my husband and my parents.  Aesthetically, it looks nice. There was a maitre'd at the door. He was welcoming, but I didn't understand the point of the tuxedo when there weren't tablecloths on the tables. Is this supposed to be a "fine dining" establishment? There wasn't even a wine list. The room had 3 4-tops, 1 table was set up for a party of 6, and there was already a group of 9 seated, waiting for their dinner. There was also a bar-type table along the walk that seated 4.  The menu had something for everyone. The wait for our entrees was VERY long. It was a good thing we got a small plate of focaccia, 1 piece for each of us, but it took about 45 minutes before we were served. I had the short ribs. Though tender, the meat was stringy and dry. The risotto was okay. My dad ordered a burger but we had to send it back because it was undercooked.  When it came the second time, it still had a part that was undercooked, but we didn't want to bother with it anymore. My dad stated that In & Out had a better burger that what he had.  I really wanted to like this place, but I don't think I'll be returning.</Review>

First time going to this restaurant. My salmon benedict was very good. Service could have been better. Young lady was nice pleasant. It was early she may have been only server there. I gave 3stars because I've only tried one item on the menu. I will go back and will recommend it to anyone looking for a place to go in Stockton.<//Text>

The sauce was tangy and smooth,  mixed wonderfully with my fettuccine noodles.  Another selection at the table was the Stonebrierburger.

Where to start. Forgotten food, so so service, room temp food, forgotten drink, but it made its way on the bill. We understand that things happen. We've had really nice visits before. So tonite will be chalked up to "one of those nights" Next time will be better.</Text>

<text>Had another great experience at The Kitchen today. Even with all the covid precautions, they managed to make it an excellent brunch experience. The unlimited mimosas helped take the edge off and we were never rushed so we got to stay till it was safe to drive. How thoughtful of them! The food was as always beyond fabulous.

Food was excellent. I had the rib eye, meduum-rare. It was cooked to perfection, one of the best I've ever had. Others at my table also enjoyed their dinners and appetizers. Service was good, not exceptional. Ambiance is nothing special at all. Overall, it was very expensive with excellent food. Good service but lousy location. Hoping it will survive being off the main path. Too bad it's not in a main-stream shopping center.</Text>

The dinner service was fantastic! The braised short ribs melt in your mouth. The chocolate tart was delicious! Will definitely come back.< /Text>

It must be the best kept secret in Stockton as it was not crowded at all.   It’s a classy place with fresh food and definitely our newest favorite place to eat in the area.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Seriously amazing!! Not to many restaurants pay attention to the details but The Kitchen @ Stonebrier is truly an exception! Who makes homemade fries? They do! Who makes their own croutons? They do! Who makes soup from scratch? They do! Who has fresh cut roses in the bathroom? Well they do of course! This is rare find in Stockton but worth your time. Don't forget to order the cheesecake. As my southern husband says its "Slap your momma good"!<//review>< pics>

The food was good. I had the exact same thing as a previous visit, down to the bread pudding. Truthfully, it was good but not as amazing as the first meal. It seemed that the same 'recipe' was used by a less experienced chef. The service was wonderful. Yes, I recommend and will return.<//Review>

<text>This place is absolutely amazing. The atmosphere and the staff here are also amazing. The restaurant is beautiful. Chef Jeff and his wife are all stars. We were able to get the Chefs table in the kitchen for lunch top of the line service and the food was to die for. I would recommend anyone in the area come here and give this awesome place a chance you wont be disappointed.<//text>< response>

< Review>
You haven't had a real sandwich until you eat here.

I am so cautious about eating tuna salad anywhere.  Their tuna has chopped onions and celery and it's perfectly seasoned.  So good!

Their tomato soup tasted so fresh and yummy. Perfect for dipping your sandwich.

The ambiance and furniture are so amazing. They have a patio with a fire pit and water features.  If you're in the waiting area, they even have heated fans on the ceiling.

Best soup, salad and sandwich spot in town.</Review>

<Text>I came to this restaurant not dressed for the environment it is meant to be and I was still treated well and given great service.  That was hugely important to me and I loved the pasta special, it was delicious! The environment is very nice and classy.

I have nothing negative to say.

This is truly a 5 star restaurant and I will be returning again in the near future.

Definitely a place I would love to bring that special someone to and have some fine wine and eat some great food.

The prices are great, they offer a selection of dishes from $10 - 50.  So it is friendly for middle class and above<//Text>< Rate>

My girlfriend and I recently dined here. Upon arrival, the door was immediately opened for us by Mark, who was our waiter. Mark's attitude, as well as his mannerisms, were exceptional. We were quickly seated at our table. My girlfriend ordered the Salmon, which was very well cooked and delicious. I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was cooked to perfection and served medium rare, which is exactly how I requested. We also had the pleasure of listening to a live jazz pianist, who seemed to have mastered the appropriate music for the setting. The food was delicious, the service was exceptional, the atmosphere was calm, friendly, and relaxing. I will most definitely recommend this fine establishment to my peers.</text>

This spot is tucked away a bit but has so much to offer! I love their outdoor seating area with the fire pit and water installation. In the colder months it creates the perfect combination of cozy and relaxing. There is also plenty of seating in their indoor area and this spot would be great for breakfast, lunch/lunch meetings or a nice date spot.

The food that I've  had has all been delicious and the staff is very attentive and friendly.<//Text>

This is a fairly new place.  I had lunch today.  The food is very good the wait staff attentive and the atmosphere very nice.  They gave outdoor and indoor dining.  The out side are has protection from the colder weather and celling fans for warmer weather.  That are open for breakfast and dinner also.  Breakfast is M-F from 6:00am to 10:00am.  Call about the dinner days and times.  I will go back.  Prices are moderate and the food is very flavorful and fresh.</text>

Had the calamari tonight.  Probably wouldn't get it again.  My husband said the duck was delicious.  Our friends both had the cod special and both liked it.</review>

Best food I have had in Stockton, chef came to our table to find out if we wanted one plate  made special because one of our party ordered a different plate with no greens or onuons. The food was amazing and the whole staff was great. There was a musician playing who was actually very good. Dining here was a true pleasure. Try it, the specials were all great and very affordable.< /text>

Had several things.... Openface roast beef... The gravy needs help, but the roast beef is great. I'm going for a french dip next time. The corned beef looks good. It's a fancy sandwich shop. Meat is hand cut.< /text>

< review>
I am writing the review on my recent visit to your restaurant. It was very disturbing to visit your restaurant for the first time since the new make over. My friend took me to lunch, and had great things to say about your restaurant. We sat and waited, and waited for water, we waited for silver wear, we waited for our order to be placed, we waited for our food to arrive once the food came my friends food was cold her turkey. I mean we waited just for her to have cold turkey who wants to eat cold turkey with mash potatoes.. No one. We didn't even get a curtsey this is the soup for today, this is the salad, this is the lunch for the day I mean no customer service at all. No feeling into this is why it's taking so long. Then my friend told them to take her food back, the manager never came over and said I apologize for the service, but sent the sorry waiter back over offering us a damn desert are you serious you foolish people. This was a disaster. My friend was so disappointed she wanted us to have a nice time. Your service was 💩💩💩💩ie.
Thank you for a pleasant experience at your restaurant. It totally sucked😵😱<//review>

The atmosphere was welcoming and calm with live pianist very nice the staff was having a birthday party and completely ignored our table including cutting a birthday cake and never offering it to any guests when we were the only ones in the restaurant. Disappointed<//Review>

<text>Unfortunately this restaurant was a big disappointment. The ambiance was nice when we first walked in and it seemed promising. The best part of the night was the live musician that was singing. However, it was downhill from there. Servers didn’t smile and seemed very unfriendly. Didn’t ever seem to acknowledge us. We were seated, ordered our drinks, and were given water. We waited for a very long time and our drinks never came. The couple seated next to us came long after we did and were being doted on by several servers, pouring their wine etc. I had to flag someone down who then asked our server to bring our drinks, she apologized but  never came back once to refill our water or to bring us any other drinks. Had to ask again after a server poured water for several other guests and then walked right by. Our server again pouring wine and doting on couple next to us, didn’t so much as glance our way. Never brought us more bread and appetizers took a good hour. Food took an uncomfortably  long time. We were there estimating two hours.  Didn’t care for the calamari, deviled eggs, or the scampi. Short ribs, salmon, and lamb chops were good. Spent about $200 for three adults and a child (we ordered lots of extras) for a mediocre experience. Not sure if this is the normal experience or if we didn’t look the part $$ but seemed like we were overlooked. Honestly, service was the downfall of our experience. We had a much better experience at Ernie’s in Manteca where the servers were on point anticipating our every need. Wandered in one day and had the best service ever. Wouldn’t rush back here.</text>< Resp>

I am giving two and a half stars because the service was excellent, and ambiance was nice. The food portions for the prime rib were good. But, it was over salted, so were the french fries. A better baked potato could have been had using a microwave. The duck breast and lamb chops were extremely small and had no flavor. The sauce for the lamb was not to my liking, and overpowered the flavor of the lamb. The panna cota, and cheesecake were large portions, but very disappointing from a flavor standpoint. I will Not be back. At this price point, I would rather spend my money wisely at Papapavlos.<//review>

I've had much better, and it was so highly spoken, not worth the time and money Food is Okay.
This was my first time at The Kitchen @ Stonebrie and I have mixed feelings.
I was disappointed in the service. For the price point I didn't feel the service measured up. From the moment I sat down I felt rushed and she was curt and dismissive.
I'm really sorry that this was my experience because I really wanted to like this place.</Text>

Bad neighborhood beautiful building and interior. Seating is very limited and music is a little invasive.
Food was average at best. We ordered different dishes to compare. We left not wanting to come back
Because the area and atmosphere isn't what we are comfortable with.<//text>

< review>
Amazing customer service and Cesar was so kind and patient.  He explained everything so well and answered all the questions I had with such a great attitude.  The store was clean and welcoming and I didn’t feel rushed or pushed into anything, like I have before at the other store by Target in Escondido.  This location was a breath of fresh air!  Hopefully I never have to go to that store (by target) again and this location can help me with everything I ever need!  I’d give 10 stars if I could!  Keep up your great work guys!  You are appreciated!</review>

<Review>Lydia was working by herself at the store on valley parkway and was able to help me right as the stores closing time. She demonstrated very professional and friendly customer service and made sure my iPhone 11pro max was ready to go. I was very anxious and was afraid she wouldn’t have enough time. But with ultimate satisfaction in mind she did her job with excellence! AtNt is lucky to have someone as dependable and knowledgeable as Lydia !<//Review><GmapID>0x80dbf3688c39b9dd:0x3ebf58cecb7183be</GmapID>< Resp>

May 6th 2020, 4:45. Christian gave amazing service.

I called on behalf of my mom who has been having issues with atnt's customer service for about 6 months, she's had a hard time with the outsourced customer service understanding her problem and helping her, Christian answered the phone today, may 6th at 4:30 and finally helped my mom get somewhere with figuring out what is going on. He was incredibly professional and super patient and understanding while she detailed the very long saga. Thank you so much Christian!< /text>

This is the best At&t location period. I wish I lived locally 'cause this would be my store. Being out of town and needing some emergency service the small female manager, with the long blonde hair, I'm pretty sure her name was Vanessa? Any way, the store manager was super helpful and fast. I wasn't in the best mood and she was still a delight. I wanted to write a review to say thank you to her. If and when I am ever in Escondido, my business will go there. Thank you!</review>

<Review>I don't often write reviews but when the service is this good I have to take the time. Though the store was busy (typical for a Saturday I'm sure) the manager, Vanessa was amazing about communicating my place in line and addressing my needs as soon as possible. Once it was my turn she had me in and out of there! I love my new iPhone and am so glad I chose this at and t store, I haven't heard great things about other cell phone stores like this in the area and was a little nervous but thanks to Vanessa and her team I had a fantastic experience! Will def be back when I'm ready to upgrade.<//Review>< resp>

Very upset with this location. Everything felt like it went well, but turned out I was lied to about the contract, and a lot that I was getting. Turned out the $5 Next installment plan addition does not pay off the phone sooner, but is a $5 fee to upgrade early. I was told that would be applied to the phone and have it paid off sooner. I was told about a $600 credit I would get for purchasing and opening a new line, turned out I didn't get it. Ohh and the free wireless charger I would get for purchasing a case and screen protector, turned out to be $15.99 that I was billed for. So it wasn't free! On top of it, I returned my iPhone 11 Pro Max on January 9th and it still reflects as an active installment plan on my account (as of 02/12/2020). So I'm being charged, and no where in the notes on my account does it state I returned the device. The 1(800) numbers for AT&T have all told me the same thing, no where do they see I returned the iPhone, and it looks like I still own it. Which I clearly did return it, and thank God for my refund receipt!! I've had to spend hours of my time on the phone, hung up on, repeated my story like 100 times, and transfered to all these different departments, and then told to contact the store. I'd contact the store and they would tell me over and over and over that there's no manager and to call the 1(800) number, or wait another week or two. I am just very very very unhappy with my experience here and really hope the issue is resolved quickly. Ohh and the person I purchased the phone from, and was lied to from was Ivan Q. Once the problem has been resolved, I will update my review.< /Review>

<review>Stopped in here yesterday to get a phone and was helped by Vanessa, the manager.  From the moment I entered her store to the moment I left she had a smile that would knock anyone off their feet. The location I usually go to has ok service but doesn’t hold a candle to Vanessa’s customer service.  I was impressed by her knowledge, speed of service, and professionalism. These are the type of people we need more of in this world.  Thank you, Vanessa. You created a repeat customer.</review>< pics>

I gave this place 2 stars because the young lady was nice but you can tell she was rather new. I wanted 2 iPhones and the ones I wanted we're not even in stock. I was told I could wait a week for it to be ordered. Really? There are to many locations for me to wait a week.  Located in very crowded shopping center.</text>

<Review>Mispresentation of services and fees by store. Promise of 45 a month devise fee and 35 dollar a month service fee. Did not explain administrative fees, taxes and surgarges, which pay as you go companies such as cricket and boost mobile do not charge. Total actual cost per month 192.00. Was told by ATT customer support over the phone on June 15, 2019 that phone could be returned and cancelled the next day for a refund. Arrived at this store on June 16, 2019 and was told cannot cancel or return since it has been 15 days and not 14. Reporting store for unfair trade practices and misrepesentation to the Federal Communications Commision and BBB They post a 5 star google review printout in their store yet have a 4 star rating.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

If I can rate it zero stars I would. They have horrible customer service. I went in a month ago to pay my bill. No one greeted me, no one asked if I needed any help, they were just there on their phones. I approached a girl employee & asked if I can pay my bill & she was very rude. Yesterday I went in to pay my bill once again, there were two male employees, on their devices. It was the same attitude I got from one of the employees( the bald one)!  So I ask my self how these people got the job???
I highly recommend going to the AT&T on auto parkway, they do know the true meaning of good customer service.</Text>

We went to the store today with two bad phones, the manager Erich went to great lengths to help us.  He knew just what to do to solve our problems quickly.  We are very pleased with the quality of service we received from him.< /text>

<review>We went in to the at&t store in Escondido on valley pkwy. There was 1 person working. We went to inquiry about my mom upgrading her phone. The only rep in the store said "I suggest you don't buy a phone from us, go to walmart". He was the rudest rep i have ever come across. He was very sarcastic, and i have never been so pissed off in my life. Trust me, we are switching my moms service, and will NEVER refer anyone to get s phone through them.< /review>< user_name>

<username>Erick Lopez< /username><Date>1349840260581</Date><Rating>2</Rating><Text>This might have been quite different experience for me being at a AT&T store. I've been to different stores like San Marcos and Carmel Mountain and received immediate help and with kind employees. At this store I was attended immediately as well, but didn't receive the answer I wasn't expecting. When I want to ask about the warranty about my flip cover for my Samsung Galaxy S 3, I was told to call Samsung about the problem because it wasn't AT&T problem. And even though I tried to tell her to if she could look it up in my account, she told me it wasn't AT&T problem. I went to a different AT&T store and they kindly changed my cover. I don't quite remember who it was, but I think I was attended by the same person that told one of the reviewers that she or he can Google the number for the other store. That being said, I will not be returning to this store.< /Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Last night I was there. I was attended by Lidia and Cesar. Buy two iPhones. I added two more lines to my business. It was a very good experience. They were quite friendly and answered my doubts. No doubt be satisfied and clear that I will return to this office. Thank you AT & T team.😉 Polo Locksmith is a really satisfied customer. 😊

Erase past experience. I could not do a new review. 🙆🏼♀️😬 ***

<Text>Four stars because it is more expensive than other storage places. Also, they don’t have any small units available right now. Excellent service though. Someone always answers the phone and has the knowledge to help you. I wish the hours were extended. Sometimes you need to get to your stuff before 7am or after 7pm.< /Text>< time>

So far this has been a smooth experience. It’s easy to set up an account online and submit your information. I saw the unit and it looked clean and well kept. Will update in a few months.< /review>

My family was taken care of swiftly and everyone we dealt with was very kind. The units and grounds were immaculate and we will be enjoying our unit for a long while. Very clean and very nice people! Recommend it for anyone that cares about cleanliness security and nice landscape.  Thank you Bill and Sandy Aug 2019. Great rates also!<//Text>

< Review>
What a great experience even tho moving is anything but enjoyable. I reserved a unit on line at a greatly reduced savings. When I went into sign the papers and show ID, I met the office manager, Candace. Was an absolute delight to work with. Showed us our unit and then swept it out and made sure no cobwebs were in the unit even tho it was really clean. Bent over backwards to make us feel like more than a customer. Happy demeanor with a big smile each time we went there.</Review>

SCAMMERS! BEWARE! Went in to discuss POSSIBLY renting storage gave credit information and stopped midway as we didn't feel comfortable at the storage site, the lady said no problem if we decided we wanted the storage to just come back and she has our information ready. We didn't come back to agree and use the storage.Next morning FULLY CHARGED for the storage! Owner SHEILA is so RUDE, yelled and said " I wasn't here but you gave the credit card information." I said "yes, but we didn't finish the process, agree or put our things in storage why are we being charged?"  She continued to yell and defend and then just hung up. Horrible company, stole from us for absolutely no reason.<//review>

Dr. Driver and staff are professional and responsive to patient needs. They were able to provide a comfortable alternative to standard X-rays, which can be quite painful for me. Past work that was done by Dr. driver has been praised by other dental professionals I’ve seen. Highly recommend this office.</review>

Dr Driver is the kindest doctor I know, and very thorough and gentle. He explains everything before he does it, and it is obvious how much he cares for his patients! Also, his assistants are awesome and are so sweet to rub your shoulder when he is doing the work 😊<//text>

I've had several procedures done at Periodontics of the Desert and I've had a very good experience. They answered all my questions and made me feel comfortable doing procedures that were scary to me. Dr. W. is great and everyone there is very capable and made me feel I was in good hands.<//Review>

Dr Driver is very good. He tells you the step by step process. He is very customer oriented. The staff ( Rebecca, Kora, Samantha, and others) make you feel comfortable knowing most of us do not want to be there. Thank you everyone for helping all patience with a smile.</Text>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Very honestly I was very disappointed.    The nurse was snippy and not very nice.  The doctor said “how are we doing today ‘carol”.  Well my name is not “carol”. Then he said ‘well I know you want to get out of here to go to Michigan. I said excuse me. My name is.  And I don’t live in Michigan.  Oh he says no problem. I hate when people say no problem. Yes there might be a very big problem.   Like the wrong tooth!   So needless to say I would not recommend this dentist     They really only want your money.<//text>< pictures>

I was referred to Dr. Peter Warshawsky for a consult and the entire experience from start to finish was excellent. My dentist believes there is no one better and thus the referral. I appreciate the office employing the latest on-line techniques that allowed me to complete the usual health history documents on-line. The office was easy to find, the staff welcoming and professional and Dr. Peter was great! Providing I have not other reason to visit, I’d stop by just to meditate on the lovely salt water fish tank.<//Text>

<review>This office Was referred to me by our Orthodontist who has bee caring for our family for 20+ yrs
Never on my 82 years have I had my teeth cleaned so effortlessly😊. Our oral care( my wife added herself 5+ yrs. later) has been sterling.
The front office staff runs effortlessly. If there are delays or scheduling issues we are notified.
Billing is handled again w/o effort.
I even found neighbors who use the practice.
I recommend them w/o hesitation.< /review>< username>

Dr. Affrunti was very clear in her explanation of my issue and the recommended  procedure .  She and her assistant were excellent in putting me at ease during the procedure.  Highly recommend this dental practice.<//text>< pictures>

Dr. Driver is fabulous.  He's thorough and professional.
He has the patient's well being foremost in mind.

The "nurse" who  was in the room while we waited was very odd.  She asked me if I have cancer.  The question out of the blue made me very uneasy.  It was totally inappropriate.  Her comments in general were strange.
That being said, I would still visit Dr. Driver because of his expertise and hope that the same person was not there.< /Text>

<text>Cierra the dental hygienist was magnificent. The Dentist seemed caring and careful as well. The only thing I would improve would be the front office personnel; the young employee was laughing and goofing off while checking people in. The front office was the only part of the experience that was unprofessional. I would recommend this dental office.< /text>< username>

<text>The office is a bit hard to find. However when I entered the door the office was so friendly and quickly gave me confidence that I found the best place to begin an implant! Meeting Dr. Eric Driver and his assistant really convinced me that I had found a dentist I could trust.< /text>< response>

I have used Perio of the Desert for many years and have to say they are a quality operation.  Dr. Pete is the most knowledgeable and kind individual and so is his team, it shows true leadership to have a professional team who genuinely cares.  Kudos to Christie!  Lorie Mead, Blythe, CA< /Review>

It was good experienced. And it is not big deal, but I just wanted let you guys to know about person was wearing with Dental Surgical Binocular Optical Glass Loupe with LED Head Light Lamp. That is a little bit annoying during I got lie down on the seat. Every time moving , that light hit my eyes . So I don't know should I reporting or not. But don't get me wrong, that idea is good for Dentist or Hygienist. I 'm just saying sometime bother that LED light hit my eyes. Thanks.</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Hint: (Don't go to just anyone, especially deciding by costs. Having an awful first experience with another dentist caused so much pain,  financial and emotional stress and resulted in a failing implant.)  Then I was sent to P.o.t.D., Dr. Warshanski literally saved my tooth and me! Pulled out the former implant, and redid it all CORRECTLY! What a huge difference it made. I had to keep questioning things because it was such a different, stress free experience and the Dr. and his staff were so patient, understanding, professional and helpful!  I just had my last check up and ALL IS PERFECT!  These tears are pure joy and excitement. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!<//text>< Pics>

It’s always the same, the gals in the front office are rude, unhappy and very unwelcoming to everyone that enters. My husband and I both wish we could come in through a different door so that we wouldn’t have to see or speak to these women.

Dental work is good and professional.< /Review>

It would be difficult to give an unbiased review because i am in love with the the treatment that i have received from Warshawski"s staff, and my hygienist (Sarai is amazing). A #1 5☆ Quality treatment. Beautiful staff! Great team. Thank you,  Alfredo Bazua and Family</Review>

It's not every business that you remember their names and they remember yours. Dr. Driver was great. I had to have a tooth extracted and Dr. Driver took the time to explain the process and why I needed to do a bone graft after. The procedure went well, relatively painless, and back to work the next day. Dr. Driver definitely took care of me.

His staff took care of me as well. Whether it was Cierra for my initial exam, Korah for the pre-op explanation, Sabrina to help with the procedure, or Rhiannon with post-op instructions - the entire staff was super helpful and I felt valued as a customer. Thank you Dr. Driver and team!</review>

I'm a big chicken when it comes to the dentist!  When Dr Driver told me I needed to extract a tooth, I wanted to run! However he put me at ease and his staff was informative, which calmed me down. I swear he only took minutes to do the extraction and it was painless! I love him and I'm sending him more patients!<//Text>

I have been coming here for 11 years. Our relationship began when I cut my gums by my frontb teeth and Dr.Warshovsky did a bone graft.

My gums are healthy because I use him for all of my teeth cleaning.<//text>

Dr Warshawski, I really want to thank you and your staff.  I realize how hard it was to fit me in on such short notice allowing me to be able to make my travel dates.  I feel a 100% better now.  You always seem to surpass my last visit with an even higher level of impeccably quality of service. Thanks again  Doc!<//Review>

I’m so glad I’ve found Dr. Warshawsky....., He just saved two of my teeth so I won’t loose them. He  also has done an amazing job on my two implants. The stay is exceptional.......... so professional and make the horrible experience so much more tolerable............ Thank you 😊<//Review>

I couldn't have been more comfortable even though having 2 teeth extracted.   Dr. Driver answered all my questions and did not proceed until he was sure I knew what was happening.<//text>

What a truly amazing experience I had at Periodontics of the Desert.  Thank you to the entire staff and especially Dr. Warshawsky.  After a failed root canal by different practitioner, due to an unidentified underlying condition I found myself at risk of losing my tooth.  I was referred to Periodontics of the Desert to address the underlying condition and attempt to save the tooth.  I was seen immediately due to the time sensitivity surrounding the probability of a successful outcome (saving my tooth!)  After a consultation visit in which a detailed path forward was laid out for me we set a procedure date for that same week.  Talk about terrified. This was going to be the most significant procedure I had ever experienced.  Dr. Warshawsky took the time to address each and everyone of my fears.  He was very clear in setting my expectation level.  We were 50/50 at best to save my tooth.

On the day of the procedure the staff did an amazing job at keeping me calm and making me comfortable.  Not only was the procedure a complete success (I woke up with my tooth still in my mouth!!) it was truly a piece of cake.  No pain or soreness immediately following the surgery and the recovery was equally easy.  I was given a very clear set of guidelines for healing success that proved to be perfect.

Thanks again to everyone at Periodontics of the Desert for getting me through this challenging experience as best possible.  I would strongly recommend Dr. Warshawsky and his team if you find yourself in the unfortunate need of periodontal work.< /Text>

<time>1524927707892</time><resp>None</resp><text>I went to Dr Warshawski for two implants. He only completed one of them because he said there was a problem with the bone in the other so he would do it at another time. He finished the one implant and I did not see him again until a year and a half later when the implant broke off and fell out of my mouth. He replaced the screw and although I told his assistant I felt it was a tiny bit loose she denied there was anything wrong! I left but some months later the whole crown broke off and this time they realised that the pin in my jaw had been cracked, it wasn't just the screw that was the problem. So now he had to sedate me again break open my jaw bone to remove the cracked pin, close it back up, wait for it to heal and then start all over again from the beginning!!!!!
Keep in mind except for $600 discount off many thousands of dollars I had paid and that I would have to pay again to do that one implant again this was overwhelming! About 2 weeks after surgery I started to feel this pain unlike anything I ever felt while I was healing. I called the office and went in. Dr Warshawski didn't see me. His assistant, Marisa did. She decided there was nothing wrong!!! The pain was getting worse! I called and went into the office 4 times (for 4 weeks) and the Dr did not come in Marisa relayed messages to him in his office. I told her I knew I must have an infection due to the unbearable pain! Finally after a month of this she looked and found pus coming from the inner side of my gums! I still did not see the Dr but Marisa came back to give me a Rx for an antibiotic.  How did he know how much I needed if he didn't even see me! Is she playing Dr?
The antibiotic was not strong enough and the pain became unbearable. I was referred to Dr Peter Scheer who opened his office on a Saturday morning when he heard about what I had been through!!!!
I couldn't even get Dr Warshawski to come into the next room to see me!!!!!!! Dr Scheer has been treating me since September 2017. I've had two surgeries and have lost all but 4 teeth on my bottom jaw due to   an infection that occurred while under Dr Warshawski's care.  I had to take high doses of antibiotics orally as well as I.V. antibiotics 3 times a week at Dr Scheer's office (weekends included)! The infection was so bad since it had been neglected for about 6+ weeks by the time I found a competent Dr that didn't let his assistant step in and practice medicine for him. After 7 months I was able to stop antibiotics. I can barely eat and I've never experienced pain like that in my life. I still have no teeth. This is almost the end of April 2018!!
During this whole ordeal Warshawsky has been notified by phone and reports and records from Dr Scheer concerning everything that I have gone through! Not once has he returned a single phone call to Dr Scheer (not even out of courtesy for cleaning up his mess)  And he also was notified from another dentist I go to that I was very upset and would at least appreciate an apology!  But no I guess he doesn't agree! I never right reviews but I didn't know what else to do. I was so shocked by this experience. I thought I was going to a very good dds and the office staff is very nice! Except that MARISA she smiles but she lies thru her teeth and I suspect she may not have been giving him all the proper info but then he shouldn't have given her so much power!
We're working on getting some kind of teeth made which will make it one whole year of my life gone! And this man, this supposedly, top notch dentist won't pick up a phone, send a card, return my dentists courtesy call? What kind of a person does that??? What kind of a human being? Wow, Man up, dude!!!!!!!!😥</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< GmapID>

<Text>Dr. Driver always exceeds my expectations.  He explains what he is doing very clearly and his work is gentle.  My teeth are quite sensitive and Dr. Driver always makes sure that I'm not in pain which I totally appreciate.
He is the best!!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< user_id>

<review>Booked a class for my wife. She said he kept touching her and left his hand on her thigh during the class.

He didn't let me go with him during the class citing insurance issues.

Would not recommend if you're a lady wanting to take the class.

Plus, Hindi is the only language he can properly communicate in.</review><resp>None< /resp>< Rate>

Excellent teaching by Navjot sir. He taught about the smallest of details and showed me exactly how to approach driving in general. I passed my driver's test the first time thanks to him.

Would highly recommend.<//Review>

<text>I passed my driving test today. All thanks to Navjot Sir. He is very patient and well versed with the drive test process. I had no driving experience prior to joining the class. I passed on my first go. The instructor is very flexible with class timings and very detail oriented. He will guide you not only with your test preparedness but will also prepare you for effective and safe driving. I completely recommend taking driving lessons from Navjot sir.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>Mr. Navjot is a good and professional instructor. He teaches everything that is required on the test and helps you all the way till your actual test time.

I followed all his tips and tricks and passed the test pretty easily. I would recommend these classes to anyone who want to start learning to drive, or who just wants to get some hands-on before the test.<//Review>< pics>

<text>I started taking classes from Mr Navjot, a month back. I could only take classes during the weekend and he has been considerate of my timings and made time for my classes in his packed schedule. He has been clear and composed in his directions and teaching. I cleared my driving test in the first attempt and I am thankful to Mr Navjot for the same. I would definitely recommend taking driving classes from him.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Navjot Sir was my driving teacher and I passed on my first attempt. I had no prior driving experience and it was an uphill task for me as I was very nervous about driving .  I am so happy today that I was able to pass my test in my first attempt and all credit goes to Navjot Sir and his teaching style. I was very uncomfortable trying to drive before and now I am a lot more confident and also enjoy driving.  He is always on time , willing to help you with the adjustment of time slots and was very patient while teaching . I did use to train with a different teacher and it felt like lot of work every time . But with Navjot Sir it was delightful and very relaxing and comfortable. I highly recommend this driving school .<//text>

<review>I just passed my driving test 30 minutes ago. The instructor is so patient, gives clear instructions, and teaches even the small details that the drivers need to know for the driving test and for driving in general. I actually didn’t expect this good quality learning with this really affordable price.

I took driving sessions and the drive test with Navjot sir.

Navjot sir is punctual and provides a flexible schedule.

The session time is usually confirmed a day prior to the practice, since he has to consider the availability of multiple students and give priority to those whose drive tests are approaching.

What I particularly liked about the sessions:

1) Does not prompt a lot, mostly to provide directions. Allows the student to make small mistakes and points them out, so that we can learn from it. This practice instills an awareness of the road conditions in the student and an understanding of the corrective actions to be taken.

2) The routes taken during the practice sessions present different scenarios that reinforce the driving guidelines given in the DMV handbook.

I am glad to share that I passed the driving test with very few errors.

Would highly recommend driving sessions with Navjot sir / A One Driving Center< /Review>

I passed my DL test in the first attempt all thanks to Mr. Navjot! He was extremely patient and provided every single detail and instruction I would need to know to pass my test and also become a good driver. The price that he offers is the best in this area for the kind of expertise you will be under.< /Review>

I had the driving lesson with Mr. Navjot and it was so smooth and helpful, can't even describe it. If you are new to bay area or someone who is struggling to get the license, I will definitely recommend Mr. Navjot and his training for it. It will surely ease up your life.
Things to note:
1) Super Punctual.
2) Necessary knowledge right beside you.
3) Flexibility of scheduling.
4) Very reasonable and best pricing.

And a very friendly face, not to forget. Super Happy :)< /Review>

Very good instructor. I started from scratch and learned it well in few classes. Prices are best in industry in this area. Instructor is very professional, knowledgable and an honest person. He will make sure you learn everything properly that is necessary to pass the test. It will be definitely a good value for your money. I would strongly recommend.</Review>

Being a new driver and procrastinating getting a DL for over three years, I finally decided to give it a shot. I'm glad that I had Mr. Navjyot as my driving instructor. I passed my driving test on the very first attempt.
Mr. Navjyot is flexible with scheduling, responsive and on time. He is friendly, patient and has a well maintained car.
Highly recommend him as a driving instructor.</text>

I'm 42-years old, and had had below zero driving experience before I started taking driving classes with Mr. Navjot. He was super patient and polite with me, always punctual: never late for classes and the DMV appointment. He guided me along the whole way: showing the dashboard of his Toyota from day one up to my passed behind-the-wheel test this morning. Thank you very much indeed, Sir! I'm the happiest person on Earth today: never thought I would pass the test and get my driver's license :).< /review>

During all three of my lessons he took a 5 minute break and returned me back home 20 minutes early. This is probably because he books his appointments back to back so he needs to take time from your appointment to drive to another appointment.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The instructor for A One Driving School was excellent.  Mr. Navjot was very helpful and showed me what I would need to pass the behind the wheel test. I  will be recommending this service for anyone who needs six hours of practice behind the wheel. Because of these lessons, I passed my behind the wheel test on my first try.</text>

Navjot sir was a great teacher for me. He was always calm and cool in pointing out my mistakes without loosing his patience or being aggressive . Sharp in timing and dates. His pricing is also reasonable.  He was also flexible in taking extra hours at very less price. I would recommend him for anyone who is willing to take driving class in San Jose and nearby locations.< /Review>

I had very limited time at San Jose, around 6 weeks in which I wanted to get a License. I had around 15 years of driving experience in India and thought I can do it easily here, however Novjot Sir made me to realize how much experience we have in India, that much difficulty I will have here with all driving rules, whole new mindset of driving style, thinking process etc., I soon realized we need to change all our mindset, thinking process to drive here. Contribution from Novjot Sir was incredible. He was very helpful, patient and also knowledgeable person. I recommend him whole heartedly for all the people irrespective of age, experience, etc., He was my Driving Guru in USA.<//text>

Mr. Navjot was an EXCELLENT driving instructor! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND him. He tells you what you did wrong and how to improve for next time. He makes talk, so you aren’t nervous, and so the car ride isn’t just quiet. He tells you good job constantly so you know you did good. He’s very polite and patient with you. I’m glad I picked him as my driving instructor. I will be recommending him to people that need 6 hours behind the wheel. I felt very comfortable driving with him, as I said I HIGHLY RECOMMEND him! Thank you Mr. Navjot!</text>

Strongly recommended, I have been driving in India for 8 years but its really important to learn all the rules before you start driving in the US. Navjoyt sir is great in teaching. He is very skilled at his work I can vouch for sure. All the best..! I passed the behind the wheel test in first attempt.< /Text>

<review>I was extremely nervous to start driving and his patience was very comforting to me and allowed me to gain confidence in myself behind the wheel. He's a great instructor and I would highly recommend him to any one. 5 stars for sure.
UPDATE: Just passed my driving test today and I just have to thank Navjot for everything. I had so much anxiety and nerves going into my driving test and he helped me remain calm and confident in myself and in my driving. I recommend him for anyone especially those that get easily anxious.< /review>< date>

Have driven in India, but the rules are quite different here in the US. Took a few classes from Navjotji and he patiently helped me with all the rules and took me on all the different types of intersections. Highly recommended him to all my friends. Extremely patient and really soft, makes you very comfortable. He is especially good for new drivers, puts them at ease and removes all your fears.<//Review>

<Text>It was good experience. Navi was very patient with me and made the class not boring. The class is specifically targeted on passing the behind-the-wheel test. He gave me some small tips but I think the second and third classes could be more heavy on practicing skills like parking rather than just simple straight down the road driving. The pace should be adjusted to every student depending on his/her level. The reasonable pricing and the instructor's patience makes me give it 5 stars.<//Text>< pictures>

He is a very patient driving instructor. He corrects you immediately and teaches how to do it the right way. He will have you repeat turning and changing lanes, whatever you are weak at, until you get it right every time. He tells you everything you need to know not only to pass the exam, but to be a good and safe driver. My driving has severely improved with 2 lessons. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Navjot Singh and A One Driving School!<//Text>

Learning to drive from A1 has been a great experience for me and I will recommend them to anyone who wants to learn driving.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<text>Navjot is a really horrible teacher. He barely taught me anything to pass the driving test. He only cares about taking your money and just teaches you the bare minimum for the basic lessons and doesn't try to elaborate on the lessons at all. His English is pretty bad too but it's understandable since English is not his first language. I had to switch to a different driving instructor in order to pass my driving test. I would NOT recommend this driving school.< /text>< pictures>

He is not only good instructor but also makes you comfortable. I was having problem with left turns and he made sure that I practice enough to get good idea about it.
Really good experience for my first ride 😄😄< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Very friendly and professional.
Got my license today. The previous attempt was not so successful. Coach, Navjot was caring, helpful and took the right amount of time to make things proper in the subsequent attempt.
I'd strongly recommend A One driving school.
Keep up the great work!</Text>< Rate>

Navjot Sir is a very good instructor for driving. He is very patient and has an amazing ability to nudge you towards doing the right thing. Since it is difficult for first time drivers to keep all things in mind while driving, he helps by repeating the same basic things that one has to keep in mind. He is also very particular about following​ rules and safe driving. I recommend him highly to anybody who wants to learn driving as a beginner.<//review>

I am currently taking classes from Mr Navjot Singh and I couldn't wait to give out a shout out to him! This is the first time I have put my hands on the wheel and Navjot sir makes it so easy! His every lesson is a new learning and I can't believe how good I have become in just 4 hours of class. I highly recommend taking lessons from him. He sure is a blessing for all those looking for driving lessons!</review>

<Text>I've 8 yr of driving experience in India but I wanted to have a hands on experience and guidance on the USA roads. A friend referred Navjot Singh and I took the service. It was a very practical and useful experience. He gave lot of tips which are specific to the USA driving. I strongly recommend his service.
Cheers!!!

I  had my 5 day training class with him each class was over 2 hours almost .  He used nice graphics to help explaining those rules. Finally, the price was much lower than the other schools I checked. My confidence driving has improved greatly with his guidance I will be taking My behind the wheel Test Next week . I Highly recommended because the lessons were spaced out to give new drivers time and also scheduling was easy with the driving school.< /Text>< pictures>

Mr. Navjot Singh is very professional. I rented a car from him to take my driving exam. I was worried about renting it from someone and relying on them to be on time but Navjot came to pick me up an hour early. He explained the car features and drove me to the DMV and back home. He was very nice and helpful. I strongly recommend him.< /Text>

Mr. Navjot sir is a very polite, patient and down to earth person. He is a very skilled and hardworking instructor and explains driving instructions very patiently and clearly. I took couple of lessons from him and it really helped me pass my behind the wheel test at Santa Clara dmv today! I would like to mention that due to lack of practice and fear of the  road I failed the test earlier, but then I contacted Navjot sir and revised my driving skills with him. He made it very comfortable for me and I really like to thank him after God for this major success in my life. I really appreciate Navjot sir’s excellent instruction and would like to recommend him to others too. Two of my teenagers are getting ready to sit behind the wheel, so I will definitely ask Navjot sir for their drivers training.</Review>

<Review>Mr .Navjyot is one of the best instructor one can get especially to students who haven't tried their hand on a car . He is very patient to his students and guides the students not only to clear the driving test but also guides to drive safely . He is very punctual and always be sharp on time .Most important he books appointment based on the students convenience and is very understanding with your time .I would definitely recommend him to any of my friends and relatives . I was able to clear my DMV test because of his guidance .</Review><rate>5</rate><response>None< /response>< Pictures>

I recently moved to Bay area from India. Based on my friend suggestion went to Navjot Singh for driving class and within 3 classes he made me drive car without any issues. He teaches very well and point out mistakes correctly. He is the best in bay area. Now, I recommend him for all my friends ..:-)

P.S: I never drived car in India ;-)</Text>

I am a new driver and Navjot sir has been very patient in teaching me the basics. He teaches in the right way to ensure that you follow all the rules from the first day. The class is really helpful for beginners as I got to learn the rules along with parking, changing lanes and everything that is needed to be a good driver. I highly recommend Navjot sir to anyone who wishes to learn driving or even improving their existing driving skills.

Update: I passed my test and thanks to Navjot sir for all the guidance !< /review>

Hello Navtej, Ssa. Congratulations and lot of THANKS. With the Blessings of Almighty God, I could Qualify the Driving Test on 18th June. Could not reply due to some technical issues.

Navjot is very friendly and makes sure to remind the rules every time until you become comfortable.
I was able to clear my driving test(with no previous driving experience) in just 3 classes.</Review>

Instructor Navjot Singh were really encouraging and motivating and I was able to get my behind the wheel easily because of his guidance and support. The practice that Navjot sir gave me were really helpful during my test. Because of him I was confident at the day of my test. He even encouraged me to drive over the freeway with him, all the way to the DMV, and that boosted my morale even more. He helped me hone my driving skills which were the key factor why I was able to get my license. The test was difficult but I was prepared, thanks to Navjot Sir.< /Review>

Navjot was my driving instructor. Navjot was very patient and supportive with my driving classes and even the DMV driving test. I have recommended many of my friends to reach him and learn driving from him. Though I failed twice, I passed the third time. With respect to price, learning with him is lot cheap than others. With respect to teaching, Navjot is very patient even if we make mistakes and makes sure that we learn every piece of driving. If you are new to driving and looking for a driving school instructor, i would always recommend Navjot.</Text>

He made driving for the first time much less stressful than what I had thought it would be and gave me clear instructions as to what to do and how to pass the exam, I would highly recommend him to be a person's driving instructor any day.<//review>

<Text>San Leandro Little League loves Burrell for its baseball !!  Good People !  Concession stand ! Grounds are always kept nice !  Wheelchair accessible !  The city should consider a bathroom next to the concession stand but the 1's they have are nice & clean !  2 full sized diamonds w/bleachers on both fields.  Small play area for your littlest athletes too !
Very family friendly & big parking lot.  Visible from the 880 freeway, right behind Marina Square Shopping Center.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Great store. Very impressed :) I loved how big it is and how organized it is. Very large inventory of clean and high quality items. Huge collection of dvds and cds that we’re in great shape. I spent some time looking at clothes which were well organized and in good condition. One of the downsides was that items as a whole were overpriced. For used goods, things should be priced more progressively imho :)< /Text>

<Text>I'd like to First say that I was very impressed with the management, he went over the top in customer care. I wish i knew his name, the entire time i was there i heard him walking around telling his employees how great they were and what wonderful work they were doing. The woman in front of me in line had mentioned she was homeless, the manager heard this as he walked by the register, stopped and told the woman she didn't have to pay for the items of clothing, he then proceeded to walk back towards the store and invited her to gather some more clothes. I had tears in my eyes,  it was so nice to see such a kind hearted person doing the right thing.  I donate a lot of items to the goodwill and i sometimes get a bit upset that they charged so much, but this store has reasonable prices and to see that donations are distributed to the people in need at no cost changed my thought process on thrift stores. No more goodwill for me...Deseret Industries is where ill be donating and shopping from now on.
All of the staff is very friendly, overall this is a wonderful thrift store, its very clean and organized and might i add... it's huge!<//Text>< pics>

They have some pretty good stuff. It is very clean and organized. Prices are a bit high. I purchased some books and some clothing. The clerk who’s name appeared as Lupe on my receipt was saying that the prices on some of my clothing were not correct. Why label them with that price then? Total waste of time looking for bargains and ended up paying more due to the clerk. I was tempted to leave all my items.< /review>

The prices have gone up a lot since I started shopping at Deseret Industries. Had a couple horrible experiences with a cashier Veronica. She always makes it seem like if the prices for my items have been changed. Since then I have decided not to shop there. She makes me very uncomfortable and prefer not to shop at a place where employees treat costumers that’s way. The lady at the door is always super nice though.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Use to love this place but prices have definitely gone way up. Will never return because of a horrible employee Lupe/ Veronica. She picks at everyone’s things and makes it seem like people change prices. I have seen it happen to others and she did it to me. I have never felt more embarrassed  in my life!! She did it to the people in front of me as well. She needs to go ASAP.  All the other employees are always so nice and welcoming except that lady . In the receipt her name appears as Lupe but her tag says Veronica. Read some other reviews saying the same thing about the prices and im 100% sure it was her. Sometimes you find things with store tags and they sell it more expensive than the actual store. Remember it is donated stuff they are getting way to greedy.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>One of my favorite thrift stores. Everything is nice, neat and well organized. The store is always clean and the selection of clothes is huge. All the clothing is color coordinated and organized very well! The closing is in good condition and they have a lot of top quality items for sale. I have never seen another thrift store this well organized. I love seeing what hidden treasures I can find!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Horrible costumer service. Veronica the cashier is horrible. I grabbed a couple of dresses for my daughter and she started picking at the prices as if they were not the correct ones. She said these are not the correct price. I asked her if they all had a standard price that they go by and she said no. so i asked her what the problem was that if they were labeled that way then that was a problem with the people labeling them not mine. to make story short, she upset and frustrated me to the the point i just left everything. Like i am still shopping to support and I am I am being treated that way. NO THANKS!!!! WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN!!!< /Review><user>102266028172029171366< /user><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< rating>

<review>Went in today and found a blazer for my husband and the price said $10 but then a lady that was the cashier -Veronica- told me it cost $25. I asked to speak to a manager because it clearly had a price but this cashier was insinuating that I changed the price. This made me so mad that I just left my blazer and left the store. This cashier has the worst costumer service skills. She is rude and because of that I will never return to this store. I’ll shop at Goodwill.</review><UserId.>101129001620520315787</UserId.>< Date>

Poor customer service. Came in went straight to helmets as my son needed one picked 2 helmets went to register the clerk started looking at me like a tattoo freek then said oh! Something wrong here and started picking at price tag as if it were relabeled and then had me stand there while she convinced someone that it was not right then set it on the floor as if I would run out with it. The helmet was a 5 dollar helmet in my opinion. I payed for other one then asked to see manager. Was told no one available for you sir.
I called and after some time Dave the assistant manager got on with attitude.
By better security! Do something to fix your problem. Not humiliate your customers by interogating them at register in front of others obviously DI needs training before they train others.
Very disappointed.< /review>< Pics>

SoCal does not have good thrift stores compared to other parts of the country but this one is a gem. Like any thrift store you have to be prepared to wade through a lot of junk to find the treasures, but this store is very well organized, clean, and has a lot to offer.</Review>

Unimpressed. Purchased a few books but even they were so randomly priced I almost didn’t purchase them. 7 book series of children books prices range .50, .75, 1.00. Why? Why is busicut makes a friend more expensive than busicut loves his white shoes?!?</Review>

<Review>I recently came to shop at this store and I love how the clothes are organized here as well as the prices. It is definitely cheaper than Goodwill and they give you 15% off of your next purchase if you do their survey after you bought something. Some stuff here such as furniture and some non-clothes items are a pricer if not a bit pricer. Overall, the store is clean and organized.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>This store was pretty clean and decent. All of the merchandise was organized very well. I didn't see very much product that was loose or lying on the floor. The quality of the merchandise was good. However, for a thrift store their prices are a bit high. They do sell some brand new and name brand merchandise. Unfortunately, while I was in one of the aisles, I noticed a few employees who seemed to be more interested gossiping instead of workinog. Otherwise, I had a fairly pleasant shopping experience.<//Text>< GmapID>

Though i haven't shopped here, i have donated clothes and shoes. Every time i go to donate, there is someone different at the drop off, but always the same grateful sincerety that makes me want to give to them more.<//text>

Great place to find collectables and rare books. The store is used to give people jobs skills that don't have any. They also have a few new furniture items available.<//review>

I am a common customer at this thrift store as well as a few others directly near by. This store has a huge selection of whatever it is you may be looking for plus a ton of other stuff that will catch your eye and interest. The prices are reasonable, staff is friendly and the store is always clean and organized. As for the dude that gave them a 1 star rating because they were mormons, I do appreciate your honesty and also appreciate you not having anything to do with them because that means one less dude to compete with in finding hidden gems in there! I am not sure exactly what religion the church is, but amen to these bargains! And as for the dude that left that bad review with the goofy hat that is affraid of girls, coodies and mormons.... .  .   .    . Burn in hell!<//review>

<Review>When I saw that it was a LDS(mormon) ran thrift store, I put my stuff down and walked out. I dont support organized religion of any sect. They did have a ton of great stuff though. Worth checking out if your ok helping fund the LDS.<//Review></record>

They are alright, but if you are seeking employment they will take forever to get back to you and if you call they give you excuses and the run about.</Text>

The food and drinks were tasty, but the atmosphere is what makes this place special. It is a very welcoming  area and they do a good job making you forget you're in a shopping center. Will definitely make this spot part of our regular routine.< /Review>

< review>
I was looking for a coffee shop to go to right before work and it was this one or the Starbucks down the street. If you go to Corona for work, you’ll know how miserable the traffic is in the AM! So instead of going to Starbucks, I go to this one and wait for the traffic to die down since I only work a few streets away.

Location Landmark: it’s right next to Ralph’s!
Customer Service: 100% ❤️❤️❤️
Drinks: 100%
Interior/Look/Ambiance: if you like Bob Marley you’ll like this shop. It’s quiet in the mornings, they have big tables if you have big groups and smaller ones too.
Internet: not recommended for uploading big files, like photos. But if you’re only browsing, you should be fine :)<//review>

My wife had a chai latte, which was way too sweet. That's why 4 stars only. The triple shot Latte I had was definitely five stars. Very smooth and had strong coffee flavors, but wasn't acidic at all.</Text>

<review>I went in here to grab a banh mi and Vietnamese coffee. The coffee is a bit strong for my taste. However, the banh mi is where it's at. Highly recommend getting it here. It takes a bit for the sandwich to be made, but it's worth the wait... Thinking about that banh mi makes me want to go back for another one! Mmm.. If you're a fan of Lee's Sandwiches, Xpresso Urban Cafe's will make it better! Pretty good for the one around the area.</review>< Pics>

Coffee taste great. Coffee and food are at an affordable price. Food is decent, tried the Skinny bagel. They have a breakfast and lunch menu. Very unique and chill atmosphere -- Bob Marley portraits and paintings on the walls; they sell a few Bob Marley/Jamaican-themed items. The owners and staff are very nice, and the service is quick. I like that this a small business, not a coffee chain. Located in the Ralph's center.</text>

<Review>I came here to work while my kids were in summer camp down the street. I made the mistake of going to Starbucks one of the days. Xpresso is cleaner, tastier, more affordable, and has faster service than Starbucks in the neighborhood. The food was delicious! And the staff were great. I will come here again and again.</Review>< pics>

Excellent sandwich and coffee. Good price and excellent service. I give the place and the people 2 thumbs up. Definitely stop again when I take that route?<//Review><response>None<//response>< Rating>

This place has a great view to the lakes. It is very clean and the staff are exceptionally nice. You can see the kitchen from your table and that is so cool to me. It's like watching the food network.< /review>

This use to be my favorite shop until they changed ownership. Prices increased and quality went down. They fired all the old staff and completely ran it into the ground. My favorite drink was the Pumpkin Spice, it was made with real pumpkin spice filling! I went in right before halloween and not only did they admit they changed the formula it was a crappy syrup. It tasted like dirty dish water. They gave me at least 3 wrong orders and were just downright rude! I use to go every week, but lately, I haven't gone at all. Why waste my money. I give this place until March of 2017 - then it will be gone for good. No one is going to put up with overpriced coffee and sandwiches with crappy service.< /text>

It's a bummer this place is under new ownership. The old staff that worked here we're a much friendlier group of folks, and were a good fit for this atmosphere. I wonder if these are the same owners that ran the previous coffee location to the ground before Urban Xpresso. 👎🏼<//text>

I work at the Domino's across the center and just had the Sonoma salad(with no bacon) from there. Was absolutely amazing! I'll try it with the bacon next time as it was missing that bit of saltyness but that was my bad. I've been there before and had their Mediterranean chicken sandwich and that is the bomb. That pesto on the sandwich is amazing. I totally recommend going!</review>

<Review>Randy at security self storage has been so helpful with all of my storage needs over the past few years! I have always felt like my belongings are safe and well looked after and he is always very friendly and eager to help! Making my payment is always very easy as they have many options but any needs I have are only a phone call away, he always answers the phone! Thank you Randy!</Review>< Pics>

I rented two different units and rented a Uhaul truck twice. The manager is the best here, he always was so helpful and courteous to my wife and I. The manager was available to offer suggestions and was very helpful. I would recommend this business to everyone.< /review>

<review>I can rest easy knowing my items are safely stored at Security Self Storage. The Staff are very kind and treat me with respect. This place is by far the best and safest place I've ever stored my belongings. The rates are very reasonable, too!

Annoying! There is only room for one car to enter the gate code at a time (who does this!?!🤷‍♂️) So if someone is already there you get to wait on the side of a busy highway where people drive 50+MPH until the person in front of you drives in.

Also, the unit next to mine smells strongly like gasoline, so naturally so does mine, I was getting high on gas fumes just looking around in my unit!... Isn't it illegal to store flammable liquid? Not here I guess...</review>

<review>The on-site manager, Randy is extremely diligent about keeping his customers storages and their contents safe from all hazards, both human, and environmental. I find that a comfort, in these changing times.  He is readily available both on the phone and in person even after hours when there is a need.  He is honest, and helpful, easy to talk to, yet never intrusive.
I highly recommend Security Self Storage to anyone who is in need of temporary, or long term storage needs.  Their prices are reasonable and competitive with many of the smaller storage facilities, yet they have top of the line security, which has given me peace of mind knowing that  my things are safely stored there.</review>< GmapID>

We stopped by just as Randy was closing up to see what was available.  He showed us what was available and initially didn't have what we wanted, but on the way to a storage unit that he was going to show us, he saw one that had just finished moving out.  We got that unit as it was the size we wanted.  Randy was tops in customer service and we found the facility well secured and clean!  I highly recommend Security Self Storage.  Thank you, Randy, for going above and beyond!

I would not recommend this place to anyone I used their services the manager Randy was very unprofessional and disrespectful. He was unhelpful he tried to tell me that I was attempting to scam him when all I wanted to do was close my account. He misspelled my name and when I attempted to correct him he was disrespectful and ignored me. He has no phone ettiquet he abruptly hung up on me on numerous times when I was trying to explain to him that he had my information wrong and was asking him questions. I had never had to deal with such a rude and disrespectful person. I will never again rent a unit here.< /text>

For being a transfer station, and not a landfill, the pricing wasn't horrible. The smell in the dump area was a little strong, but not unbearable. Biggest improvement would be to have the workers help.< /review>

Given its a recycling and trash dump, it's not soo bad. When it's hot it can smell a bit but not too over powering, although I hate the bee's and fly's. Driving inside the place can get scary and you can get blocked in by big trucks if you go right before closing (there's a massive line that goes thruout parking lot which is smaller and they are parked pretty much.). It could be a lot worse overall but also could be better. I think they pay a little more than the 3rd party centers at the grocery stores so I keep coming back here and just follow a few rules of mine and it works out fine for me. Suggestions: wear a pair of old tennis shoes (no flip flops gross), bring disposable gloves to wear, hand sanitizer and some kind of wipe sanitizer disposable type thing, if can avoid the heat do it (go earlier in the AM or if I can wait till weather cools I do), have stuff separated before you go there, and take at least a big trash bag full of smashed cans and one of plastics which is all I recycle here otherwise I feel it's not worth the whole trip if I'm not cashing in at least $30. Sunscreen for those fair skinned like I am. Oh and on hot days when the bees and bugs are flying all around, a face mask to protect your mouth and you don't have to worry about one flying in.< /text>

AMAZING! Everyone here is truly caring and dedicated to meeting your needs. Came in for my first cleaning post Covid with Brooke and couldn’t be more grateful for such a memorable experience! From the front of the office to the back everyone makes you feel right at home. It’s the only place I’ll go now. It can be scary getting back into the groove of things so if you are wondering where to go, it should be here. (:< /review>

The Camarillo Smiles team provides an excellent experience. From the customer service to the dentistry - they are professional and friendly. My hygienist, Lauren, is amazing! She’s knowledgeable and thorough. Her passion for exquisite dentistry work (and your health) is very evident. The team here truly cares. Highly recommend!</review>

A few months ago they created a partial for me. It fit perfectly as soon as it was complete. Never had to get an adjustment and it’s very comfortable to wear. If you’re looking for a an outstanding, caring dental practice this is the place‼️</Review>< userid>

<Text>Camarillo Smiles is the best dental practice I’ve ever gone to. I had some traumatizing experiences with mean dentists when I was young and so I didn’t go for years. I was so self-conscious when I came in for the first time but all of the hygienists are so nice and I have never felt judged for having taken poor care of my teeth in the past. After a series of deep cleanings, my teeth and gums feel so healthy and I feel I have a lot more knowledge about the best way to take care of my oral hygiene going forward. I highly recommend them, especially if you are afraid of going to the dentist.</Text>< Pics>

Qualified people providing expert level care . Always friendly, always knowledgeable. They actually care and have for many years . Top of the line new equipment and offices. Services you can get are best described by them as the machinery is new and complex. Imaging of soft tissue to understand whatever may arise . Full service . If you ever had a great dentist and you miss that , you should check them out. They’ve thought it through.< /Review>

Had a horrible toothache! Looked up closest dentists and found Camarillo Smiles. From getting seem so fast on a weekend, to being able to text my doctor, to getting my appointment moved closer due to continuing pain and having a root canal done with virtually no pain, i am beyond happy to find a new dentist here in Camarillo! The staff is amazing, kind and professional. The office is clean, the procedure rooms are maintained very clean as well. I felt safe and in good hands. The doctors are very nice and down to earth, definitely make you feel welcome and that you’re in good hands. Bringing the rest of my family here for their dental needs from now on. Thank you!</Text>

I will recommend everybody to Camarillo Smiles! I came in, I’m so much pain, with a broken tooth in need to a root canal. My appointment was kind of far off due to my schedule & when my pain got worse I called and they got me in the next day. When I came in I was so anxious and Dr. Egelske calmed me does immediately. I’m not sure how much I was showing it at first but I was honest about how he was feeling and his staff turned the fan on, gave me water and he numbed me a lot so I would have piece of mind that I wouldn’t feel anything. Throughout the procedure he was careful, quick, and dialed in. All while his assistant knew what moves he was going to make before he made them. They worked very well together and the cat videos ON THE CEILING was the cherry on top. If I knew dentists offices were this nice I would have come a lot sooner! Don’t worry if you come here, they take care of you!< /review>

My kids love this place! They are so kind and treat my little ones like they are important and big kids. They take time for each patient. The staff and doctor are good at educating them on dental hygiene and they are conservative with dental treatments (ie they don’t encourage anesthesia for children like other pediatric dentists do). Plus, the treasure box is a hit. I guess they are going to be giving out dye-free toothpaste in the take-home toothbrush kits next time too, way to go! I always thought it was weird that dental offices gave kids that blue dye toothpaste from Colg8. I’m sure it is free from the company, but it is horrible for a kid to brush with dye coloring!< /Review>

Been coming for years ! From the time you walk in you are greeted with good energy and happy faces. You immediately feel safe because they do tempatutre checks and are provided a sanitized pen.

My cleanings are the best!!! It's literally equivalent to a spa day. Although I had other hygienist that do am amazing job. I got used to Jenny. Leaving out I smile with confidence and know this is the place to be for thoroughness and professionalism.

My entire family goes here. Great pricing and good with kids and braces.

Give them a try you won't regret it.

Smiling 😃 more thanks to Camarillo Smiles.</review>

I have been going to the same dentist office for about 20 years, so when my insurance changed I was really hesitant on finding a new place. This place is really great. I love how informed they are on the latest research and our really up to date on their medical devices. The hygienist Miretta was so amazing, she was very kind and was able to make my transition to a different dental office a lot easier. I definitely recommend coming here!< /review>

Everybody at Camarillo Smiles is friendly and helpful.  Dr Czubiak has an amazing team of dentist, hygienists and support staff.  Kat (my hygienist) is clearly passionate and thorough regarding my oral health.  She really takes extra time going over my exams, daily cleaning routine and the results/ changes in my oral health.  She’s awesome.< /Text>

<review>Camarillo Smiles is seriously the best! From the front desk staff, to the awesome dental hygienist (MARIETTA!) and of course, the dentist himself. They’re always so sweet, make you feel comfortable and explain everything in detail. I’ve never really been a fan of dentists but that has changed ever since I started coming here!<//review>< Pictures>

When I received my cleaning I did not expect to receive so much information about my gum health, teeth, and things to do to make them better. Jennifer was great and so was the dentist that came in to give an exam. Thank you 🙏🏼< /Review>

< Review>
Hands down best experience at a dental office... & I’ve been to a fair amount of them. Maretta was extremely skilled & made me feel very comfortable throughout the whole process of x-rays, & cleaning. Dr. Brett was also very knowledgeable on all of the new techniques & made me feel at ease during his part. They have some of the coolest new technology that made everything so much easier. I highly recommend checking out Camarillo Smiles if you haven’t been to the dentist because of a bad experience. They will change your perspective & show you what a skilled professional staff looks like. Will definitely be back.< /Review>

My experiences at Camarillo Smiles are always enjoyable. People don't usually describe the dentist's office as being enjoyable, but from the friendly office staff to the caring hygentist to the knowledgeable doctors, everyone is always so pleasant to interact with. They do everything they can to make sure you are comfortable the entire time. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for their 'right dentist.' I have found mine! 😁< /Review>

<Review>I was hesitant to go to the dentist because of the current COVID-19 situation, but I didn’t want to put off routine cleaning any longer because I was already overdue. Routine cleaning is very good for your health overall so I decided to go. I felt the whole office was doing all they had to and beyond to minimize the threat of spread. I was impressed with the measures they are taking to ensure safety for all. I felt very confident and comfortable going to them and wanted to share my very positive experience.

Never thought I would say it was a pleasure going to a dentist office but this place makes you say “It’s a pleasure going to the dentist office!”  Always a professional but super friendly staff greeting you when you walk in the door!  I would happily recommend Camarillo Smiles to my friends and family!< /review>

Camarillo Smiles is my go to when my teeth need help.  They are kind, gentle, polite, and do a beautiful job.  I can’t say enough about how wonderful they all are.  Thank you Camarillo Smiles.

I needed help during the lock down.  There was a quick reply to my call for help.  All precautions were in place to keep safe free me the virus during my visit.

Later a scheduled teeth cleaning was done gently with even more precautions put in place. Cass did a great job.  Thank you Camarillo Smiles.  Number one Dentist office and staff in my book.  Thank you.< /text>

<text>I always have a great experience here. All of the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. During my visit today, my oral hygienist explained a lot of causes/effects regarding oral health that I didn’t realize, particularly restricted airways and the importance of tooth alignment beyond cosmetic benefits.

They have recently installed a machine that scans your head in less than a minute, and it provides a detailed 3D model of your mouth. The model is able to accurately show you different areas of your mouth, such as cavities, sinuses, resting tongue position, etc. It greatly enhanced my understanding of oral health, and areas to focus on beyond brushing and flossing my teeth.

I love Camarillo Smiles and will keep coming back as long as they’re around!< /text>< Pictures>

Cass (hygienist) is great! She listens and takes a patients input to provide the highest quality service. I’m not a fan of Novocain and when I told her this, she Used a different method to numb me and I feel terrific! No more droopy lip or incoherent sentences. I highly recommend this practice!<//review>

Camarillo Smiles are friendly staff overall. My cleaning was a painless experience, and my treatment was honest! The front office is clear on charges and insurance coverage which is very important for anyone’s budget. I would highly recommend!< /review>< Pics>

I came here today after not having been to the dentist in a while. Everyone was very friendly and so informative! You can tell they really care about you and your health. They did everything they could to make sure I was comfortable and the office was very clean. A very pleasant dentist experience.</Review>

<Text>I can’t speak highly enough about Camarillo Smiles. From the moment I walked in, I was made to feel welcomed and at ease. My hygienist is thorough and gentle. There are several dentists in this office and while I can decide who I want to see, I have never been disappointed. If I was to select an overall quality, I would say dentistry with compassion.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1571152359688, 'text': 'Thank you so much, Sunny!

<text>Took two years off from any cleanings or dental work because I had a horrific GI infection causing severe nausea and acid reflux. I had been going here for around 5 years (or more I can’t remember) before I stopped coming completely but was very diligent with my cleaning appointments and getting any work that would need to be done before it got worse.

With all of the acid reflux in my mouth (especially at night while I slept and often didn’t wash my mouth out afterwards), no flossing and sometimes not brushing for weeks because of the nausea my doctors told me if I ever came out of this (and multiples times I was told I wouldn’t) I would need extensive dental work. They never looked at my mouth, I was just going through so much it was assumed.

Last week I came back for my first cleaning in a long time and I only had ONE cavity because the amazing work Camarillo Smiles has done. I feel thats the best endorsement I could ever give a dental office. Keep up the good work. If you haven’t gone to this dental office before make an appointment here instead of your regular dentist even if they are so booked it will have to be months out, this place is absolutely worth the wait.

Oh yah and they have this new dentist that I absolutely LOVE! I can’t remember his name but he works FAST and is very quick witted cracking well timed jokes throughout the appointment and always has something nice to say. I think his name was Egelske?</text>< pics>

<user_name>Mary Valdivieso</user_name><text>This was my second visit as after the first, I figured that I would give it another  try but both visits made me feel like it was a constant up sell.  There is a questionnaire as a new patient that asks how you feel about the appearance of your teeth and I noted that I’m happy yet I was suggested braces, retainer and or whitening by every single person who’d seen me.  It felt too sales-y.<//text><gmap_id>0x80e83618e7d470dd:0xc9168dc6f80d7e22< /gmap_id><response>None< /response>< Rating>

If you are looking for a really great dentist that not only takes care of you but answers all of your questions throughly you found the right place. Dr. Ehde is amazing. She went above and beyond for my son today. I am so grateful that I came in. She is such a caring human being. I am forever sending everybody I know to go see her. I am really happy.</review>

First time going to the dentist in a long time. I had a very bad toothache. Camarillo Smiles was recommended to me by a friend. Dr. Holiday performed the work and was very nice. She was gentle and did a great job along with the nurse. I had two teeth filled and will have two more done in a couple weeks. They did a great job explaining what they were going to do and why they were suggesting it. The office staff was very nice and helpful. Addy the dental hygienist was nice as well. Everyone did a great job and I am very pleased. Their office was nice and comforting as well. Would recommend them to friends and family for sure. I have multiple appointments set up with them to get my teeth in better shape as my teeth had some issues.<//Text>

My son can be anxious in new places, and with new people. It was his first time at Camarillo Smiles. They were wonderful with him and worked extra hard to make the experience as fun and pleasant as possible.<//Text>

<Text>The moment I walked into the office everyone was SO sweet. Before I could introduce myself, the front desk receptionist greeted me. The hygienist that cleaned my teeth was adorable and so nice. I usually don’t do well with cleanings as I’ve found them to be painful, but she did an amazing job at keeping me comfortable while still thoroughly cleaning my teeth and gums. By far the most hospitable office I have ever walked into and I will definitely keep going back.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Maretta is the best hygienist I’ve ever had! I actually look forward to going when I used to dread it in the past. Super friendly staff and doctors and they accommodated me really well since I’m in a wheelchair. They also had checked my insurance ahead of time so I knew what was covered and what would be out of pocket. Highly recommend going to Camarillo Smiles!< /Review>

<Text>7 AM is pretty early, but that is a good time for me.  Everything went smoothly.  The hygienist was pleasant and professional as was the dentist.  Thanks.
A later appointment this time--7:45.  Same results, though.  Pleasant , professional hygienist--dentist also.  Thanks.
7:30 this time, but no real difference.  The hygienist was very professional, polite, and efficient.  The dentist came it at the first because of needing to go for a surgery, but if there are problems, he will call.  Highly recommended for professionalism, safety protocols, and efficiency.<//Text><name>David Gibson< /name><Time>1615398860587< /Time></record></dataset><record>

I always have a great experience at Camarillo Smiles. From the ladies at the front desk to the techs and dentists working on my teeth, everybody is pleasant and helpful. The staff at Camarillo Smiles make a typically zero-fun experience much less terrible with their kindness and positive chair-side manner.</Review>

Wonderful place to go to get your regular cleaning. Everyone is just so friendly and they do a great job! Quick story to show you how cool this place is... Wife couldn't find a sitter to watch the baby during one of her scheduled appointments and called to move the appointment. They told her to come in anyways and one of the sweet ladys up front watched our baby and even got him to take a nap. Seriously... this team is the BEST!< /Review>

I just moved down from Utah and broke a crown. The office got me in the same day. I loved the texting option to set an appointment and the online patient information form. Sarah was awesome and so was Dr. Holliday. Such great service—start to finish. I’m glad I was referred to them. Thanks Camarillo Smiles!< /Review>

State of the art equipment, cutting edge treatments (Vivos), and best of all knowledgeable staff with upbeat, friendly atmosphere!  I enjoy my visits to the dentist (no joke) and I have learned so much about anatomy, etc.  They take the time to educate which I really appreciate.  They are great with my kids, too!!</review>

<Review>Awesome experience at Camarillo Smiles today.  They are always very exceptional, but today was the best!  I had my first implant ever and was very apprehensive and nervous.  However, Dr. Daniel and the staff were awesome!!  No pain during the procedure and I was out in a short amount of time.  Hopefully this is my only implant for the duration of my life, but if I have to have another one, I will definitely ask for Dr. Daniel.

Thank you very much Camarillo Smiles for a wonderful experience!!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

They always take their time with me and I never feel rushed and my questions always are answered! Eddie is the best dental assistant. I also have seen several hygienists and they all were great! I have never had any billing issues,all the costs are given up front so there are no surprises!I definitely reccomend this office!<//text></record>

I love coming to Camarillo Smiles the staff at the front desk is always super friendly and helpful.

<text>WOW!!!!!! I can't say enough good things about this practice!!!
- AMAZING with kids
- On the forefront of dentistry (use specialty products like flourish ions, CTX mouthwash and toothpaste - I am very cavity prone and have not had one cavity since starting with this combination)
- No local injection for kids cavities they use a LASER!!!!! (for small cavities only but so awesome!)
- very friendly / accommodating hygienists and front office staff
- most appointments are free or fairly cheap with our Delta Dental insurance
- They are very cost conscious and ask before they do anything
- they are very slow to treat and monitor patients especially for larger procedures like root canals
- Dr. Edhe is SO nice my 5 year old had her first loose tooth and she didn't force her to take it out and did not use any injections just topical numbing and let her wait in the office for over 2 hours! She just kept checking on her in between patients
- I was so impressed with them I even switched and we live in Ventura but SO worth the drive!!<//text>< rating>

Camarillo Smiles is the best! The service there is all around excellent from the moment you are greeted at the door to the moment you leave. I started going there after the great deal they gave me on invisalign. I used to go to a different dentist, but I was so impressed with Camarillo Smiles that I switched over to them for my cleanings as well. Thank you to all of the Camarillo Smiles staff for always making my trips to the dentist a pleasant experience.<//Text>

They do great work, can always work to fit you promptly in case of emergency, and are very honest and professional.  I saw a dentist in LA after an ill-advised caramel popped my crown off and he really raved about the quality and durability of the crown Camarillo Smiles made and put in for me.

Everyone here who has worked on my teeth has been informative, thorough, friendly, and meticulous.  The office is really pleasant and clean with a lot of little amenities.  The office staff is also very courteous and efficient.

I really appreciate how they don’t give you a hard sell but think through the possibilities and explain the options.  They also don’t perform services and surprise you with charges later.

On my most recent trip after I had another dentist quote me $1200 for a chipped tooth that was deteriorating around an old filling, Camarillo Smiles cane up with the option of replacing the filling instead of resorting to a more expensive crown, saving me something like $850!!!  They could just as easily have recommended the crown and I would have had no idea.  I think that is definitely worth the drive!

The dentist and dental assistant worked together and were very meticulous and exacting about fit, appearance, and comfort.  My dentist was totally great and I don’t know if I’ve ever previously encountered an assistant so knowledgeable about the job, which was very impressive!

Finally, they are sensitive and flexible when it comes to finances and work to fit their services around what you need and can afford, while still making you feel like a valued client.

Definitely bring your teeth here!  A good dental place is hard to find!<//text><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Not a terrible way to spend a Saturday morning. Kristen is an excellent hygienist and explains every step of cleaning. She's thorough, friendly and comforting. Dr. Daniel is also very friendly, humorous and easy going. He gave me a clean bill (no cavities) so that's a plus! Highly recommend this facility!</Review>

Cass is great, always encouraging me to find ways to take care of my teeth and gums.
Communication from the office is bad. No one reminded me the whitening trays were ready when I was there. In fact, no one called me when they were ready. I called to ask after a long time passed.< /Text>

<text>The best dentist I have been to in my life! The staff are smart, kind, and thorough. I always feel like they are giving me their full attention and are never rushing out the door to get to their next appointment. Dr. Czubiak is full of knowledge and goes beyond his responsibilities as a dentist to make recommendations that he believes will improve my quality of life (for example, having a sleep study done). Highly recommend!<//text>< Pictures>

So professional, friendly and thorough.  Front desk staff was warm and welcoming.  And I especially liked that the receptionist asked me if I minded if she put whomever was calling on hold (so that she and I could finish scheduling my next appt).  Instead of putting me who was right in front of her on hold while she answered and took the call.  Definitely made me feel important and everyone like to feel that!  I cant recommend this place enough! Thanks Camarillo Smiles<//review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1570146356795, 'text': 'Steve, we are so happy our office met all of your expectations!

I went to his office today to get my teeth clean and the staff from the front desk to the dental hygienists that worked on my mouth were very nice and professional.
The hygienist explained to me what she was doing and also how to take better care of my teeth.
I’ve always been a satisfied customer and that’s why I would recommend anyone whose is looking for a dentist, to try Dr. Czubiak and his team, and I know you won’t have any regrets.< /review>< pictures>

Always love coming here for my dental visits. Love the dentists, and staff. This particular visit I was in incredible pain. I was seen by Dr. Ebde not sure of spelling and she was absolutely wonderful. I needed a complex root canal, she referred me to a specialist and went above and beyond to make an appointment for me and inquire if they take my insurance. She’s wonderful, a class act, caring.< /Text>

He never pushes unnecessary procedures and he takes the time to explain things simply!  He has such a kind heart and he makes "going to the dentist," not a drudgery!

Cass cleans my teeth!  She also is very personable and does a great job cleaning my teeth!  She is thorough and professional!  She encourages me to keep up with my own dental hygiene as well!

I have to say that my experience with Camarillo Smiles has been awesome!  Lisa always greets me with a warm smile and has always been helpful when it comes to scheduling and the insurance "stuff!"

As I sit here with a mouth full of Novacaine - Dr Czubiak is quite simply the greatest Dentist on the face of the Earth!  When he says “this isn’t going to hurt at all,” he is exactly right.  Golden touch.  And the nicest person ever.  25 years with him.< /Review>

Never before in my life have I looked forward to a dentist visit, but everything is right at Camarillo Smiles—everyone is friendly and helpful; Dr. Ehde is so careful, conscientious, and knowledgeable. I’m so glad to have landed here, especially after having had some nightmare dental care experiences.<//Text>

<Text>Oh man this place SAVED MY TEETH! I came into this place traumatized from previous dentists and extreme anxiety. Lainee walked me through the whole process of coming in for a review. I was so not ready for what I got. Lauren allowed me to Express my fears and anxieties but also help me get through them. She stood her ground when I got overly anxious and kept me calm. Dr Edhe so graciously went above and beyond to help ease my transition into proper dental care. Its worth every mile for Camarillo Smiles! Thanks for giving me confidence back!! 1. Brush 2. Floss 3.

I had a wonderful experience at Camarillo Smiles. The office itself was so cute and welcoming (also very clean). I had Maretta as my dental hygienist (cleaning and xrays) and she was fantastic! She made me feel comfortable and walked me through everything we were doing. I also found it so helpful that they look at your overall oral health, including a look at your tongue/airway/breathing. Dr. Ehde (dentist) was great as well, she was too the point and explained everything thoroughly, which I appreciated!< /Text>

I really love Camarillo Smiles! The staff is all SO friendly and helpful, it makes a huge difference to have a happy and capable staff. I moved to Sherman Oaks and I continue to go to Camarillo Smiles for my appointments because I am so happy with the service they give.

Mona is my hygienist and a large reason as to why I continue to go there. Mona always takes care of me, is on time, and genuinely cares for my wellbeing.

I would recommend Camarillo Smiles to anyone!< /text>

<review>I have the great fortune to consider myself more than a patient. I am a Camarillo Smiles family member. What’s special about Dr. Czubiak and his entire staff is that I became a family member that first day in 1989.  I feel this way not only because of how I was, and continue to be treated, but also because I know I will always be treated with the most cutting edge technically sound methods available.

Oh, it’s also because I have never ever met a more gentle, light handed dentist in all my years. Even the most fearful patient will leave the office amazed. Honest!< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1535646421726, 'text': "You are so sweet, Tom!! We thank you so much for this amazing review.

There is always a smile when I visit Camarillo Smiles. I had a problem with a crown found during a cleaning. A new crown was arranged that day. When it came in, there was another problem but that was fixed. All is good now.<//Review>

Love Dr. Ehde and staff. I have had some extensive dental work, Dr. Ehde’s touch is gentle. The staff is friendly and very helpful.  I have a “long term” temporary crown that has come loose a couple of times. The desk staff has worked me in the same day, Eddy has taken the time to replace the temporary and it matches my teeth. I can’t say enough about Camarillo Smiles.<//review>

I’ve avoided dentists for years. Dr Edhe put me at ease and I’m slowly getting over my fear. She’s patient with me, breaks things down for me in simple terms. When we are sitting in the room, I feel like I’m the only patient on her mind. Not to mention a great staff and personalable ladies at the front desk. All around wonderful experience.<//review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Just got my teeth cleaned again with Lauren. She’s been taking care of my cleanings for the last 5 years. I like her progressive approach to oral health. No heavy-handed painful scraping (I have very sensitive roots on my teeth!). They use lasers and ultrasonic scalers and my gums have never been healthier. Lauren does an awesome job of making her patients feel comfortable and cared for. Dr. Czubiak, Dr. Ehde,  and the crew at Camarillo Smiles are very friendly and professional. As a dentist myself, I know most of the dentists in the area, and there are only a handful of really good ones. I love these guys!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>I really love Camarillo Smiles. So much, that I fly to California periodically from the midwest for my cleanings, among other things!  They bring up possible causes for my dental ailments that I would have never thought of, and offer great therapies to alleviate those ailments! They are not surgery happy and are affordable if you do not have insurance.<//Review><username>Tara Jones</username>< Rate>

Office staff very professional.

Mona is also professional, experienced, efficient and quick!

One minor annoying Delta insurance issue will hopefully be resolved by my wife's June cleaning.</text>

I've never had an experience at a dentist like I did at Camarillo Smiles. Everyone, from the front office staff to the dental assistants and head dentists are so pleasant to speak with. I never felt like they were trying to sell me on unneeded procedures or products.

Rebekah Ehde is like no other dentist I've seen before. I never thought it would be a pleasure to go to the dentist. She has shut down any previous hang ups I've ever had.

Mona was a joy to talk to. She made me feel comfortable and she informed me of every procedure she was doing. She has such a wonderful disposition and is so endearing.

Lisa was my first encounter there, as she is at the front desk. What a lovely person she is. I know it's cliché to say, but first impressions are so important. I knew immediately that I was in the right place because she put all worries at ease.

Lainey was the last one I saw as I went out. She was so on top of her game. There's nothing worse than coming out of a dental appointment and seeing some huge bill with unknowable codes and so forth. She took care of everything so efficiently and with such attentiveness.

In summary, the staff is outstanding. Almost oddly outstanding. I was referred to Camarillo Smiles by a friend. She's been going there her whole life. Now I know why.< /review><Name>Jesse James<//Name><date>1496793424062<//date><userid>102586081316107597793<//userid>< pictures>

Went in today after having tooth extraction a week ago. All Dr.'s there knew I had a bad week and were very supportive.  The hygienist was especially gentle and I greatly appreciated her caring touch.  Dr. Czubiak assured me the extraction site was healing well, whatever pain I was having should continue to decrease.  It's always nice to see familiar, caring faces.  Thank you!  Couldn't ask for better care.</review>

I was very impressed with service this visit, my hygienist who goes by the name of Lauren was very pleasant, very friendly and extreamly professional at her job, she created a comfort factor with no discomfort whatsoever therefore I was very pleased with this visit.
I will request  Lauren again :)<//Review>

It was thorough and extremely beneficial for all of us.  The office staff were all friendly and efficient like always. Mona, the hygienist was fabulous again.  Dr. Ehde, the dentist was so knowledgeable and gave us detailed typed information about all five children's dental needs.  This check up was an extremely helpful and postive expenerience.  This is the ideal dental clinic for children and adults!  The Camarillo Smiles staff all work together like a second family and as a caring team.< /review>< user>

< Review>
Do you hate going to the dentist?  Have you had some bad experiences or lousy work done in the past?  Those days are over for you when you experience the caring and professional people at Camarillo Smiles.

Those smiles are going to be on your face from now on.  Am I exaggerating?  Please.  I rarely recommend anything or anyone.  When it comes to Camarillo Smiles and the way they have changed my entire attitude about dentistry, I heartily say you will join a very satisfied and ex-terrified group of people who have found and rely on Camarillo Smiles for all their dental work. No kidding.</Review>

Just started Invisalign at Camarillo Smiles, My first time coming here the staff at the front desk were extremely polite and friendly.  More friendly then other offices I had visited recently.  Mrs. Pezeshki was extremely helpful at explaining the process of Invisalign. I highly recommend Camarillo Smiles.< /Text>

I'm not a person who had gone to a Dentist unless it was necessary. After having moved from Ojai to Camarillo, I found myself with a cracked tooth and in need of immediate assistance. The office staff are friendly, and Dr. Pez is wonderful. She put me at ease, and even tailored the dosage of the numbing medication to help me cope with it better (I typically get anxious and nearly pass out).

I've been back many times since then, and each time has been just as good as the last.  I was fitted for a night guard to help me with my aggressive (VERY aggressive) grinding, and after I chewed through the first guard, Dr. Pez and crew were kind enough to get me set up with a new one that was stronger.

With their help, my tooth sensitivity has drastically declined, and my teeth are in better shape than they've been in in years. The office is also fairly modern in how it keeps contact with you, and I enjoy getting the emails and text reminders for appointments.

I would recommend this office to anyone, and especially someone with a bit of Dental anxiety. Everyone there has been just great.< /Review>

Went to Czubiak for 13 years. Everything is great as far as friendliness, and I love Dr. Czubiak personally, but I am going to write an honest review. Nice man, not so good at doing dental work. For example, I have a front tooth that is chipped, and since 1981 the repairs have always lasted at least 10 or more years. The material eventually wears down, or falls off. Czubiak fixed this chip 4 times in 13 years, and when smoothing with the drill he hits my other front tooth constantly. In a magnifying mirror the material is jagged, and I expect it to fall off soon again. The fix is always a huge disappointment, and I don't know why I was so lazy that I didn't look for another dentist to do this repair years ago. Another example, I had 3 inlays done, and the drilling is hard and aggressive, and 2 years later I still have some pain in those teeth. Michael doesn't encourage you to do work you don't need, but he doesn't stop you either, and explain things like - the life of a tooth, why you don't want to drill it more than necessary, because you will need a root canal. The kind of information a patient needs to make an informed decision for their mouth health. The cleanings and scaling were just ok also. Last but not least, after 13 years of devoted business, I needed a special prescription that after years of knowing a patient's individual health concerns, should not have been a problem for Dr. Czubiak to prescribe. He flat out refused, saying he felt "uncomfortable", which left me high and dry, and with ultra-sensitive tooth pain. My physician who I have only seen less than 3 times, had no problem writing me a prescription for this "substance" once I explained why I needed it. I was deeply hurt that I couldn't rely on my own dentist for help I needed when he has known me long enough to feel "comfortable" with supporting what I need. That is the entire reason you try and stay with one dentist for so long! So they get to know your individual needs. I can't write what this "substance" is, or he will know who I am. Being friendly is wonderful, but you have to be able to provide excellent dentistry too, and honestly Michael just doesn't do this, and he may let you down when you really need his help. If you need things like root canals, he refers out for this too. Suffice it to say, there are a lot of great dentists out there that are not only just as funny and friendly, but do excellent dentistry work, including things like root canals. Look elsewhere.

P.S. Lisa at the front, who also left a review here, is part of what makes people want to come back. She is so calming. Also tried the female dentist here once, and she hit a nerve when she injected me. Her fault? No, but still an unpleasant experience of pain. Never tried Shapiro, but I am finally done with this office, and off to one with an exceptionally talented hand at dentistry. Good luck Michael.< /Review>
