<Review>Sunshine house has been the most rewarding experience for my son. He joined when he was 3 and over the last 2 years he has been able to learn in a structured environment while still having fun. We were forced to find a new preschool for him at such a young age and I was so worried he would not adjust to the change. From day 1 the teachers worked with him and really brought him out of his shell. He started understanding “school” and would amaze us with his stories of school that day. Every teacher rotates wit. The different classes and I think it helps so much for the kids to learn other teaching styles and get to know all the teachers. On the verge of entering kindergarten and I know without a doubt he is ready and has been prepared for the changes ahead. My son has a bond with every teacher and I feel that’s important. The weekly themes, monthly events and family activities make being a part of this school so rewarding. I am going to miss dropping him off every day. I have been so happy won’t his school I really wish I could just keep him here forever. I would recommend this school to any parents looking for an amazing school for their kids<//Review>< Pictures>

We love Sunshine House in Oakley! My daughter has been going there for 1 year now. When she started she had a hard time separating from us but the teachers were so kind and understanding. They really helped her with the transition and now when I drop her off she is so happy to be there. Since attending Sunshine House, her speech and social skills have blossomed. She now knows all her colors, shapes, number, letters and more! She is always coming home with new songs and art work. Sunshine house is also great about communicating with parents and maintaining a clean and healthy environment. We couldn’t be happier that we chose Sunshine House.< /Text>

We have been at Sunshine House for 4 short months...but already we are in love with this school and can't recommend it enough. From the monthly, weekly, and daily activities calendar; we know what our children are doing, the books they are reading and the topics they are covering. It is a great way for us to interact with their daily learning. The teachers are so loving and kind and speak to the children with such respect. Our children are blooming at Sunshine House and we can't begin to thank them enough for allowing us to leave them there with no worries as we head to work each day.</text>

<Review>My son has been attending Sunshine House for 5 months- During this time, he has learned so much and developed friendships. He comes home in a good mood, and with tons of excitement/singing from his day.

The teachers are very friendly, and keep me updated with pictures, and text messages- which is important to have as a full-time working parent. They do a great job of developing the social skills of their kids,  and I am very happy with the experience we have had here so far.<//Review><Date>1565224312091<//Date>< Pictures>

<Review>Sunshine House Oakley is awesome! Both my daughter and son have attended this pre-school. I believe the best way to tell how your child is doing in his or her school is to pay attention to his/her mood when you pick them up at the end of the day. Our 2yr old is always in high spirits and when I ask him how his day was, it's always a thumbs up!

Their communication with parents is also excellent. I always appreciate knowing what was happening and their constant care and updates regarding the children. I recommend them wholeheartedly and I encourage anyone looking for quality childcare for your little one to check them out.< /Review><Date>1556827506599<//Date><Response>None< /Response>< Rating>

Our son started at Sunshine House when he was 2 and a half. He is now getting ready to start Kindergarten and we couldn’t recommend this preschool enough. There are so many opportunities for him learn and play and he frequently comes home with the arts and crafts he has been working on, or telling us about science experiments, taste tests or exciting visits from different members of the community he has enjoyed that day. Our son particularly enjoys playing outside in the sandbox and exploring the many activities offered outdoors.  He really thrives in the atmosphere at Sunshine House which allows him the freedom to choose the activities he wishes to participate in, but also includes more structured learning times with his peers. His teachers are kind and nurturing and are wonderful about communicating with us as parents. We have always felt our son is in very competent and safe hands when drop him off at preschool and his happy face every day speaks volumes about his experience at Sunshine House. We would highly recommend this preschool to anyone in the Oakley or surrounding areas.< /text>

My husband and I were looking to get my daughter in a preschool or daycare for socialization and heard from a neighbor that Sunshine House was the way to go. My neighbor was right! My daughter took to Sunshine House as soon as she stepped inside the door. All of the teachers and staff are extremely nice, caring, and understanding. The facility is safe and is kept clean and orderly. They make the curriculum fun for the kids and I can tell that my daughter is learning so much. Overall, I am glad that I went with my neighbor’s recommendation!< /Text>

Our son has been with Sunshine House since he was 2 and he will continue until he's ready for kindergarten.  We LOVE this preschool for so many reasons.  We love how much they communicate with us about upcoming events and our son's progress.  We LOVE that they even text us pictures of him in action during the day.  Our son is happy here and so are we.  We trust the staff completely and would recommend them to anyone!</review>

He was already fairly advanced in his skill levels, but since starting at Sunshine House, his vocabulary has increased exponentially, he now can stay focused for longer periods of time, and his comfort levels in social situations has become more apparent. We recently made the decision to move him to a 4 day full schedule to continue advancing him in all aspects of his learning. Thanks to all the dedicated staff who provide a safe and nurturing place filled with fun and creativity! Highly recommend Sunshine House in Oakley!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

We have been with Sunshine House for about 5 years now and are very thankful for them!! All three of our children have attended preschool here. The Teachers are so amazing with the kids. They are always welcoming, personable and caring to each child. Each of our kids have learned so much from Sunshine house. The academic Skills they have learned have completely set them up to start Kindergarten and school in general.  They also keep the parents very informed.  We love when we receive a picture text showing us our child participating in an activity. We love being a part of sunshine house. They have become part of our family. Thank you so much Sunshine house for everything you all have done and been a part of for our family!!!!!<//review>

My 4 year old son started going to this school a few months ago. We love it. We can't rave about it enough. The staff is fantastic with a true passion for teaching. My son comes home every day with a smile on his face telling me about how much fun he had at school. The school grounds are clean and organized and the school building is big and wide open, perfect for the children to learn and grow. I would recommend this school to everyone!<//review>

<Review>Sunshine house is amazing. Both of my kids started here at 2 years old. They have done nothing but blossom in social skills and educational milestones. From day 1, they didn’t even want to come home when I picked them up and look forward to starting everyday there. The teachers are impeccably organized, down to ear pieces to communicate with each other. Immediately upon entering the building, I felt my kids would be safe and cared for here, and they are. The teachers are smart, professional, caring and attentive. The facility is spotless! I still can’t figure out how they keep it so clean. Choose sunshine house!</Review>< pics>

We instantly got a good vibe off of Sunshine House, and have been totally pleased with them since then.

They keep parents super involved, they're great with the kids, they do all kinds of events and activities focusing on all kinds of different things (holidays, animals, colors, etc) and do lots of creative things.

Since he's been there my kids been even more a sponge and is obviously benefiting both from their teaching, and the structure and interaction with all the kids there.

Love, love, love Sunshine house.</review></record>

<review>We absolutely love Sunshine House. We feel that our kids are safe, well cared for, making great friends, and LEARNING a lot. The teachers are also amazing and have longevity at the school. This was our first day care experience for our 2yo and she loves going. She now sings full songs and knows her ABCs. She is already asking what letters and numbers are and she is not even 3 yet. Our almost 5 yr old is 100% ready for kindergarten not just from what he learned at Sunshine House, but because of the way the school taught him to sit in group, listen to the teachers, etc. We will be sad that he is leaving Sunshine but happy we get two more years with your youngest at this school.<//review>< GmapID>

I absolutely Love Love The Sunshine house in Oakley Ca.

Key things I respect at this preschool is the teachers all communicate together and with you as a parent
They send texts and pictures on updates about your child
My daughter has truly blossomed Communicating, Math, Spelling & Reading they really work one on one with your child and report to you improvements
Since being there she can engage in an adult conversation and gives her opinion at the same time😊

I love the ouch reports they give if your child had a inccedent, one of the treatments they use and circle on the report with a heart❤ is TLC which I feel is comforting due I'm not there to comfort my daughter they tend to her as I would.

I also love that they fallow nutrition and only allow 100% fruit juice,  no sweets and have alternative meals

This place is so clean and friendly environment

I'm a helicopter mom so if you are the same type of mom trust my word
This place Rocks
I can go to work knowing my daughter is in good hands< /Review>

<text>Our family loves Sunshine House.  Our son attended 20 years ago so it was the only choice for our grandson to attend as well.  The teachers are so caring and give hugs when kids need the extra attention.  My grandson is only 4 and is already reading everything he gets his hands on! I can't say enough about Sunshine House Oakley!  Good choice for any family who wants a loving, stable, caring, place for their child to learn and grow.

<Text>We love Sunshine House. Our son has been there two years and our daughter could not wait for her second birthday to join - they enjoy school, and that says it all. The staff is very friendly and the turnover is low. The Director, Assistant Director and most of the teachers have been there longer than we have. Their lesson plans are well structured and communicated through their website, Facebook, emails and monthly calendar. They even text updates and/or pictures to let us know how the kids are doing. They have a nice play yard and daily we are sent home with their work and art and crafts to see their progress. They have special events around the holidays and creative theme days throughout the year. It is clean, safe and well supervised. Every time I drop my kids off I have peace of mind they are in great care and an enriching learning environment. These 5 stars are well deserved.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The first thing we did when moving to Oakley was find a new preschool for our daughter, and after a year and half she is now graduating. We couldn't be happier with Sunshine House. My daughter was nervous at first. She missed her friends and old home, but starting her here made the transition much easier. She's made some wonderful friends too!
The teachers are amazing! Even when we see them outside of school like at community events, it's exciting for her and they're all so friendly.
The things I was looking for her was a comfortable environment, caring and knowledgeable teachers, and a good balance of fun and learning. I think we've gotten that, and she is ready for kindergarten! Thanks Sunshine House!< /text>

Our daughter has been with Sunshine House for over a year now and she has greatly grown in skills.

She has friends she plays with and talks about all the time,  Her social, reasoning, and problem solving skills have been well developed since she has been in Sunshine House.  They do circle time activities like reading or a variety of exercises. She can better understand letters, shapes, numbers, and more day to day routines like clean up after play time and sharing or waiting for a toy. We are appreciative of the level of attention each staff have given to our daughter and they give us progress reports every 6 month which also helps us as parents to focus on those areas our daughter struggles with,</text>

<Text>Our son recently started Sunshine House and all we have to say is THANK YOU SUNSHINE HOUSE!!! Our son LOVES going and enjoys learning a variety of things.  We are so pleased how clean, organized and very active the staff at Sunshine House are and it is nice to know that our son is learning and feels comfortable going each time.  As parents (especially my wife), it is always hard to trust anyone with your most precious treasure and at Sunshine House we were glad to know that they take great pride in what they do and teach the children.  We highly recommend enrolling your child here, you will not be disappointed!<//Text>< Response>

<review>What can I say about Sunshine house? Well to Start I have had 4 generations of Kids and Grand kids go to Sunshine House! There is NO place I would ever think of taking my kids other the Sunshine House! The teachers are amazing. They are all very loving, caring and knowledgeable with the Children. My Grand daughter LOVES to be at "School" as she calls it at 3 years old. I am trusting Sunshine House with my most Prized possession and they do an AMAZING job! Thank you Sunshine House for all you do Loving and Teaching our Children! You will always have a huge place in my Heart!<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Sunshine House has been head and shoulders above the rest as far as preschools go.  Our son has special medical needs being a type 1 diabetic and their staff has literally saved his life on more than one occasion.  Their attention to detail and special care has made all of the difference for our son.  The teachers at Sunshine House are dedicated and loving and treat each child as a loved and valuable member of the Sunshine House family.  I couldn't be happier with our choice of preschool for our son.</Text>< rate>

<review>My son has been going to Sunshine house in Oakley for almost a year now, and they are WONDERFUL! I am a stay at home mom and it was a though decision for me to send him at all, but we quickly realized that it was a great decision. He absolutely loves it there. He has learned so much, has a great time playing with all his friends and really loves all the teachers. Most days I can't even get a goodbye hug from him because he runs off to do something exciting! They have a lot of great activities for them all the time and I love that the parents are welcome to them as well. It's obvious the staff really care about all the kids, and I feel my son is very safe there. When my daughter is old enough she will be going there too. I highly recommend Sunshine house for your little.</review><resp>None< /resp><userid>114741806682543968806</userid></record>

<Text>Being a first time parent, I was feeling lost about what my daughter "should" know and when.  I know we are told that every kid develops at their own pace, but let's be real- parents are always worried and compare regardless!  My two and a half year old daughter doesn't talk much, so it has been hard for me to figure out where she really stands.  But since starting at Sunshine House, I no longer worry.  Although she's still not talking much, what she DOES say has me over the moon.  She loves puzzles, and when doing them, now says the shape, color, or letter sound.  She comes home singing songs, saying "thank you," and is always happy.  When I leave her in the mornings, I never spend a second worrying about her.  The teachers are amazing and are very open with communication, and patiently worked with us through my daughter's hitting phase when I was at my wits end.  The children are always entertained with themes, lunches, learning, and play.  One of my concerns of sending my daughter to preschool was the potential for bringing home behavioral issues learned from other kids.  In the 7 months she has been there, I have not once had her come home acting out, nor have I seen any kids at the school acting out of line.  They are all respectful and taught how to resolve conflicts between them, which is a huge blessing.  I could go on and on about all the great things!  Go tour for yourself and see- you won't be disappointed!<//Text>< Pics>

<text>Sunshine House is a great preschool, our daughter Olivia loves going. There is always so much excitement when we just mention school, in fact there is no stopping her from getting her backpack and shoes and standing by the door if it is mentioned that today is a school day. The teachers are really great, they are all very friendly and welcoming. It usually takes Olivia a while to warm up to people, but she has had no problems feeling at home as soon as she walks in the door to Sunshine House since her first day there.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

My Son who just started Kindergarten this year and has been at Sunshine House since he turned two and my daughter who is now 3 has also been at Sunshine House since the day she turned two. We recently tried a NON Sunshine House preschool for my daughter, that was next to my Son's Kindergarten, for a more convenient commute in the Morning. We QUICKLY took her out and realized quickly how LUCKY and SPOILED we were at Sunshine House. She is now back at Sunshine house and I now have a longer commute BUT it is well worth it!! We will never go anywhere else but SUNSHINE HOUSE!<//text><Time>1377275488143</Time><gmap_id>0x808555f786500d05:0x1f8565f94c1a5853<//gmap_id><Rating>5< /Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

He was part of the last "graduating class" and is in Kindergarten now, but every time we drive near Cypress, he still makes it a point to say, "That's where Sunshine House is!".  We can honestly say, he loved going there and he misses his teachers and classmates very much.  The staff is an amazing group of ladies that we absolutely fell in love with.  We knew that our child was safe and secure and was either learning something new, or getting his exercise on the huge playground with his friends.  Thank you, Sunshine House, for such a wonderful Pre-K experience.  You can be assured that when anybody asks if we know of a good preschool, we'll point them in your direction.</review><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

My son loves going there and has learned so much.  He has been in the pre-kinder program and I feel that he is prepared to enter Kindergarten next year. I give the teachers at Sunshine House most of the create for his preparedness.  I would strongly recommend sending your child to Sunshine House for Preschool.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Especially my little guy who has separation anxiety when I leave in the morning. The teachers are always there to give lots of hugs. And I love the hands on experiences they get trying different foods, learning about planting plants, and so on. The songs they learn and the sign language they are taught is an added bonus and my children are constantly singing/signing them.

<Text>Sunshine House has been an integral part of my families’ life since my oldest daughter began attending at the age of 2.  That was almost 5 years ago!  As my youngest daughter gets ready to graduate and move on to Kindergarten, I find myself thinking how glad I selected this preschool from the beginning.  The relationships that both of my girls have had with the teachers is priceless.  As a working mom, the texts, notes home and hugs given, have meant the world to me. I always knew how much the teachers cared about my girls and knew they were in the best care possible.  We will miss Sunshine House greatly and would recommend them to any family looking for a preschool.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
We love Sunshine House Oakley! My son has been going to SH for for over two and has a hard time being ready to leave most days.  He has made many friends which was a bit of a struggle prior to preschool. Socially he has developed significantly. All the teachers are amazing and loving.  I have zero worries leaving my son in their hands. The school and education program is extremely organized with many fun activities for the kids like special lunches and celebration days depending on that months holiday or occasion. These days I drop my son off and my not quite 2 yr old doesn't want to leave either. But she gets to attend the monthly pizza nights (aka parents date night). I cannot reccomend this school enough!!
P.s. my favorite part is the notes we get about our sons day on occasion.  I save them for him when he's older :)< /Review>

My son has been going to Sunshine House for about 3 years now. He graduates tomorrow night. I asked him if he is excited and he said "No! I don't want to leave there."  We love Sunshine House! It was definitely money well spent.  I would have to say it is hands down the best pre-school around.  We will miss all the teachers. (Especially his girlfriend Ms.Leila). <3 :)< /Review>

After the first visit, I knew this was the place for my little girl! We were welcomed by the teachers/staff with genuine kindness and it was evident that these kids were well taken care of & loved. I had a hard time getting my daughter to leave that day, she actually cried when we left! (never happens!) It is now her second week and I am 100% sure we made the right choice! She talks about her "Sunshine House" all the time and is making lots of new friends! A happy little girl make a happy Mama! Thanks Sunshine House!</text>< Pictures>

My grandson has been attending Sunshine house since Nov. 2014.  He will be graduating in June and starting kindergarten. We are all going to miss Sunshine House as it  is such a great place for kids.  The kids have so many places to learn and play inside and out.  They really do make learning fun!  Jeremiah loves circle time and he loves his teachers.  He has learned so much over the last 18 months, we just wish that we would have found them sooner and that he could stay longer!  He is doing so well with his phonics, and counting!  He has something new to share everyday about what he has learned.  Thank you so much Sunshine House, you really are awesome!< /Text>

Hands
down the best care for the kids! I have tried every daycare in the area- yes,that's the kind of mom I am☺And this is where we stopped 2 years ago. Alyssa was going full time and every day she would wake up at the crack of dawn begging us to take her to school for breakfast☺you can't put the price on a peace of mind knowing that you child is well taken care of,provided with FRESH seasonal fruits and vegetables for a snack (did not see it at even more expensive daycares!), and grows and learns so much every single day! The thought they put in their curriculum is amazing! I was recently asked how old Alyssa was ,and the person was surprised she is only 5! He said:"by the way she talks,and how she builds her sentences,she sounds like she is at least 9!" The best compliment to preschool provided Alyssa had a slight speech delay when she started! Today was our last day. But we will sure come back for pizza nights and to visit! You are such a warm and caring place,sunshine house!!!<//Review>

<review>My kids all went to Sunshine House for a couple of years. They are wild boys and Sunshine House was good for them. They liked their teachers a lot and had fun there. They played, learned and made good friends that they still play with even though they are now too old for Sunshine House. I would recommend them to anyone. The teachers are very nice and take care of the kids just like we want them to be taken care of.

Thanks Sunshine House!

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>It took me awhile to find a preschool for my son, but when i toured sunshine house, I felt very good about registering him for the year before Kindergarten.  I can see so much positive change in Aris' social, cognitive & developmental skills - he's talking a lot more than he used to before enrolling at Sunshine :).  My husband and I like receiving the periodic photos & letters from his teachers, and the 2 evaulations conducted throughout the year are really good to measure where kiddo is with his learnings.  Overall, the communicaiton is very good!  From the weekly schedules posted every Sunday night to the charts & boards upon arrival on-site.  We couldn't be happier with our decision.<//review></record></dataset><record>

My son has been attending Sunshine House for 3 months now. He started 1 month after he turned 2 years old in December 2015. As a fellow educator, currently teaching 2nd grade and previously taught preschool, I was very specific in what I was looking for. I began looking into preschools in May 2015. Many people recommended Sunshine House for their academic program as well as emotional commitment to the children. I choose Sunshine House because I was drawn to their mixed age school and curriculum as well as cleanliness. I found the mixed age school very important because I want my son to have the option to work with kids his age as well as those older with more advance skills. Children learn best through watching, playing, and teaching other children. I was very pleased that Sunshine House allows children the opportunity to choose where they want to play during the free play while also providing structured educational activities. Sunshine House exposes him to various things from letters to critical thinking activities. Since enrolling I have already noticed an increase in his academics as well as language. I also appreciate that Sunshine House uses ASL and music as well as other mediums to teach subjects. I found them to be one of the most developmentally appropriate programs for the preschool age (2-5). I also found them to be the cleanliest facility. The staff is very thorough in cleaning rooms as well as toys. I anticipated that my son would get sick within the first few weeks, however after 3 months he has not been sick once. I also liked that they kept low teacher to student ratios and promoted healthy eating habits by providing healthy snacks and encouraging parents to pack healthy lunches. All of these reasons lead to my decision to enroll my son with them, but what is my number one reason now is their attention to my son. He had a great first 2 days then he started to have a difficult time transitioning. Every day the teachers took great care in comforting him when he was dropped off (either by me or my mother in law) and always gave updates during pick up. Since the children are able to play in different areas throughout the day they come into contact with various teachers and I have always been impressed with how informed each teacher has been about my son's day. When I came to pick up I always made an effort to watch my son before going to get him and I have seen how they comfort him when he's upset. Prior to enrollment I was very impressed with their program and philosophy but now I am more pleased with how they have helped my son adjust to preschool. He always says he loves preschool and now has transitioned beautifully. I highly recommend Sunshine House to any parent looking for a well-rounded, developmentally appropriate preschool. Their staff and program is exceptional!< /review>

Overall, it was good. I dropped in because I was in the area. I was assessed with different areas of concerns and adjustment techniques were different. I will more than likely stick to my original location.<//Text>

I really enjoy my visits because I feel so much relief after I go. I love that I can use my membership nationwide since I travel to California regularly. Dr. Harris at the metrocenter location in Phoenix, AZ is wonderful. I was also seen in Rancho Cucamonga and the Dr there was also wonderful and a very nice guy. I wish I caught his name. Definitely recommend the joint as it’s affordable and accessible!< /review>

<Review>Even though I have my regular chiropractor, I’ve here several times on a Saturday when my neck is really bad. For me its worth the extra cost because I feel so much better thru the weekend.
The chiropractor always does a great job. The front desk person is always very nice.<//Review>< pictures>

I stopped going there after a month because did not see any difference. I just realize since than they have been charging monthly fee for membership. I paid 4 months fee without any service. When I contacted them. They said no refund because I signed automatically membership. I supposed to sign cancellation. No other solution or asking why I would not want to continue? Just telling me make sure you come and sign cancellation .They do not even follow patients if they feel better or happy with service just charging bills.</text></record>

<Review>You guys have mediocre chiropractors who just listen for the crack and don’t actually adjust you where you need it. You take money from people during a pandemic and then say there was nothing that could’ve been done. I am high risk and stopped coming after the shut down (which apparently didn’t matter) and that was the time our visits ended. We’re out $200 because you guys could care less about the safety of your “clients” and would rather take their hard earned money during a hard time. This place sucks.

I love The Joint! For less than the cost of my insurance co-pay per visit, I can get weekly adjustments. The doctors and staff are friendly and cheerful. I get in and out quickly and the doctor on that day, listens to which area of my body is acting up and tailors the adjustment accordingly.<//text>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>Easy place to go for a quick adjustment.  Usually there is no wait.  To get the best deal you must purchase a 10 visit or more package.  It works out if you go once a month.  You need to make sure you are telling bugging you.  If you do not speak up they will just do a general adjustment</Review>< pictures>

The doctor is rude, started yelling and cursing at me. Then told me to leave. He still charged my card, even though I never got any services.  Called corporate and they did nothing.  That's stealing and very unprofessional.  Will never go back to this location.<//text>

<review>Was traveling in the area and needed a good adjustment to get rid of a nagging headache and tightness.  I happened to be close by so stopped in.  The doctor provided a fantastic adjustment and did a great job explaining what was causing my discomfort.  This doc is good.  I will stop back again next time I am in the area.<//review>< Pictures>

I started going to The Joint about a year ago. I get tension headaches really bad at the base of my skull and NOTHING helps but chiropractic. Most techniques don’t work so Dr. Smith has to use a special technique that no other Chiro has used on me but it is immediate relief as soon as he does it.< /review></record>

Dr Rosie is the best chiropractor I have had the pleasure of being adjusted by. She is not rough or forceful but every place she adjusts me seems to sooth not only my joints but my nerves and muscles as well. She clearly puts a lot of thought in her approach of each individuals treatment. I love watching her adjust my mom because I sense her compassion and genuine care in how she takes care of my mom. Tara the receptionist always greets us enthusiasticly is quick to inform us of the most cost effective offers they have available. The facilities are always clean and have a good atmosphere. I look forward to going here and always come away feeling encouraged emotionally and physically.< /text>

The Joint is one of the best offices I’ve ever been too! Such a friendly staff and the Doctors are miracle workers. Dr. Tolbert is my personal favorite doctor at The Joint because he takes the time to remember what is ailing you, and really helps to make sure it is fixed before you leave. If you are considering going to a chiropractor, come here !</text>

I went to this place with the intentions of getting some relief. Filled out the paperwork rated my severity and where on my body the pain was. The doctor and this place was a joke. He would not even attempt to adjust me. Future reference: do not put a pain level of 10 they will not touch you.< /Review>

<text>The experience was great, I like that de Garcia took his time to talk to me about my lower back issues and I think her name was Tara she was the lady at the front she was nice all though people (customers) have ZERO patience she dealt with it very well, I think customers need to be nicer. The joint did wonders for my back I would recommend</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Walked in to recieve more information about their package options as we were referred to by a friend. We walked in and were not greeted. I asked the receptionist what the packages consisted of, her first words to my colleague and I were "it's cash only". When my colleague said, "OK? What are the services you offer?" She said in an annoyed tone, "it's basic chiropractic services. They like jump on your back. And like crack your neck." I then asked her what the services meant and she looked annoyed and pointed to the service menu.  My colleague looked at me and asked that we leave.  Please coach your front office staff on how to properly sell your services and most importantly how to engage properly with potential paying customers.  Also, we find it very offensive when the first words that come out of your paid staff is not a greeting, instead a demand of preferred payment. By the way, they only take cash. According to the help.</Review>< Pictures>

{'time': 1548866038318, 'text': 'Crystal,\n\nThank you for providing us with feedback on your recent experience. We are so sorry to hear that our efforts to help you find a more permanent solution to your health care needs was received negatively. We never want our patients to feel that they are being “sold” on our membership packages and patients frequently comment that they like how we go the extra mile to help them.\n\nProviding relief is rarely accomplished in one visit just like one visit to the gym never makes a person physically fit. Our membership plans and packages are built to eliminate the need for insurance, and our no-appointment policy, convenient and extended hours and locations make care more accessible.\n\nThat being said, we appreciate your feedback, and hope you give us the opportunity in the future to demonstrate the benefits of a more complete approach to your health and wellness!\n\nBest in Health,\nThe Joint Chiropractic \u200b'}<//Response>

Once the doctor determined I wouldn’t be picking up a multi-visit contract, he told me I was wasting my time and dismissed me, untreated and still in pain. I have had substantial, long-term relief from one treatment before, but apparently that didn’t suit him. I went through a lot of discomfort to get here, all for nothing. I can’t believe anyone in his field would do this.< /Text>

<Review>Location on Day creek in Rancho Cucamonga.  I went there twice in one day and got put off the first time and the second time.  first time I went there I was told to come back at 2:30 because im a new patient and they need more time than 20 minutes.  We go to lunch from 2 to 230.  I come back at 3:05 and I'm told sorry come back at four because we need a coordinator here with you.  this is not professional.  Waste of time and mileage.</Review>< Pictures>

Excellent customer service and great staff they are very communicative they do let you know that when you are a new patient it's best to come in 20 minutes before closing time to be correctly examined I've been going for two years now I pretty much know how they run it if an individual was truly in pain they would come in immediately not wait until they can have the perfect schedule only to come in late when it's already past closing time<//text>

Loved visiting Newsong. Love their mission, “Love God, love people.”  And their work with the community speaks to their mission. They are living it out. The pews and stain glass gives it a special touch to the worship experience. This is a great balance of modern with traditional. The band is great and the Dave Gibbons, the lead pastor is amazing! They have a coffee bar with baristas actually prepping pour overs for their attendees as part of their hospitality team. Overall a great place to worship, hear and be challenged by great bible messages and to build community.< /review>

Newsong is unlike any other church I have attended. Newsong recently moved from Irvine to Santa Ana to engage the city in a more impactful way. When coming to Newsong you can expect to encounter God through powerful worship music, an inspirational sermon, and be encouraged to take action on what you learn. Newsong has one of the most diverse congregations you will encounter in a church. People from different ethnic backgrounds, young adults,  couples, and families.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

< review>
Hey Nathan Brown, the church you went to is not affiliated with ours at all. We are in Santa Ana. There's a lot of churches called Newsong/New Song.

This Newsong is my home. Newsong accepts the fact that none of us are perfect while still creating an environment that gives everyone an opportunity to experience God's love and joy. Newsong is the most culturally diverse and adaptable church I've ever attended. We are a progressive young church that meets in a beautiful, old baptist church. Super unique. If you're looking for a church that is out of the box, check us out! Hope to see you there.</review>

Love this place. It's so welcoming and full of life and energy. All people are embraced here, regardless of what kind of walk of life they're in, and the community here goes out of their way to make people feel at home, especially people who might feel like they don't belong. And, they're doing so much awesome stuff outside of the Sunday gatherings, giving everything they can to help make life better for the people of Santa Ana and to make a real difference in the city. This is a great church, a great family!<//Review>

Great mission, great teaching, great people. Highly recommended for pretty much anyone -- longtime Christians, people who aren't sure they believe, even homeless folks.  All are welcomed and embraced.

Newsong's one word mission is "Reconciliation."  Their vision is "to zealously love God and his people, even in the midst of pain and discomfort."<//text>

There's such empowerment in the sermons and deep relationships with the people. I love the culture and the diversity. Looking back, I don't think I would be who I am today if I was not a part of the Newsong for the past few years.< /Review>< GmapID>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I'm still getting to know this place, but it is the perfect place to be confused and to be uncertain where you are in your faith and in your life. These people know exactly what it means to serve and love people beyond the surface. I have not made any efforts to find a home church since I started college. Early this year, my mother joined me here in Southern California. We've both been wanting to find a church since our faith means a lot to our family. Going to church together was something we really longed for since our home church was back in Northern California along with my sister. I finally brought her to a service a few weeks ago.  Right after service, she said, "This is it. This is the place." And if my mom can feel it, then surely, Newsong Church is something really special.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Immediately upon walking into Newsong, I felt at home.  People are so loving, welcoming, and open.  After church, the whole church eats together like family on the lawn... it's really beautiful!<//Review>

<Review>I love Newsong Church! I was living in Huntington Beach for a few months, and began going to this church after they helped with the Circuit Rider outreach. They have amazing worship (very relevant and genuine songs), honest and clear teachings, an amazing teen and children's programs and are very family friendly. They also run great seminars on the weekend.

It is a bit big, so you have to really work to get plugged in, but that would be the only partial downside. But with a large congregation, it just goes to prove that God's Truth is being preached and hungry souls are drawn to where the food is. They are also on the internet, so you can check out the services virtually if you are planning on visiting later physically! :-)</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcd84d331b81bf:0x59a94d0fd9cb2d61<//Gmap_id>< Resp>

< Review>
Church was a lonely place for me growing up, so there was a period where I stopped going and had no desire to go back. I went to Newsong in 2005 (reluctantly) and never stopped. My perception of church, worship, and community was flipped upside down and Newsong has been home ever since.<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Everyone is going to hell if they don't receive their salvation!! You must be born again like John 3:3 says Truly Truly I say to you unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. I love this church its great i have been going!!! But they don't really talk about the people that haven't receive their salvation!!! They preach the word for a little bit and they put their own thought!! Basically they care is  doing good deeds helping the poor and they think their going to heaven for just doing that. When the 2nd coming of Jesus comes and see's these people in the bible it says Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. 22 Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ 23 And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’</Text>< pics>

<Review>Great pews, great news, great food, Papa Johns! Err I mean Newsong Church!

I started coming to Newsong 6-7 months ago and it feels like a study abroad program from all the different cultures and backgrounds melted into one campus. Coming from white megachurch all my life I have never experienced such a congregation that is here. 60% or so of the congregation at the campus is Asian which is a culture shock even from one Asian brother to another. I honestly had an adjustment period in the beginning of coming here that opened my eyes to what it truly looks like to do life with a multicultural, multigenerational diversely socioeconomic group of people that stretched me in a good way.

There are some pretty sweet fringe benefits from being a part of such a diverse group of people. Exhibit A: the post Sunday service lunch. Newsong has a crew of professional chefs in the congregation that donate their time and money to make huge soul food type of meals that make 4th Street Market look like a copycat. As a foodie I have to plug this, I mean if you don't enjoy pho, carne asada tacos with cilantro rice, or authentic bimbimbop with the poached egg on top you may be at the wrong church. Oh and not to mention there is an elote/shaved ice cart lady that they let also be a part of the action too. 5/5 stars for community lunches!

I could write an op-ed about all the rad community initiatives that Newsong does in Santa Ana for the homeless community, the youth and the immediate community surrounding the church. They intentionally moved their church from megachurch capital of the world in Irvine area to the Samaria of the OC and it wasn't a popular decision from what I've heard. I like that. That type of risk taking in the name of love for the poor and outcasts is what really keeps me coming back.< /Review><rating>5< /rating><user_id>106601526988621773220<//user_id></record>

This people were supposed to come marry both our faiths and believes, but when they came joined our church, they Took over and kicked out the Hispanic congregation. They said they're here to help the Santa Ana youth, yet their youth aren't very friendly towards me or Hispanics,. Also their teachings come from the bible? Yet there's never a bible around then.....< /Text>

If you are looking for a GREAT dance workout!  You must come the Hubble Studio .  This place used to be Your Neighborhood Dance Studio and before that it was DADA.  The staff is amazing and so sweet.  I took the Dance it Out with Tor.  Fun class and the Plyojam was a workout.<//Text>

I really wouldn't want to shoot anywhere else in Los Angeles. Stage 1 is really large and has a great space for production, fancy hair and makeup area, and nice VIP/talent/ client holding.  Thanks for a great shoot!  Can't wait to come back- Richard/ Viacom<//review></record>

<review>Great place to shoot photography as well as small commercial productions just limited on ceiling grid & solid  points to rig off of but that may have been updated by now. Stage manager is really professional & knows how to accommodate well quickly.<//review>< pictures>

Far more professional and attentive than the other studios I've worked with.  The staff was super friendly and accommodating. My not so easily impressed clients absolutely loved the dressing rooms! Will be booking again for sure.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Hubble Studio is the best production studio I've been to so far- they are always on top of it and really seem to care about each project I bring in there. It's like they know that if I create successful work there, they in return are successful. Love Hubble.</Text>

< review>
Hubble is an amazing little gem not on everyone's radar. The space is huge, and has high ceilings (2 stories high). Great for events and shooting. Huge makeup/ hair/ wardrobe room.</review>

<text>Dr. Szeto is always very thorough and clearly explains any issues or concerns in detail.  Equipment and techniques are up to date and I personally appreciate that the network for any referrals needed/made have always been on point as well.  Samples for red eyes, dry eyes or even foggy lenses are at the ready for your individual needs with clear directions given on how you should use the product for best results.  Warning: The eyewear selection makes it hard not to want to update!  Appreciate that they work with the community to give back as well.

The office is modern and the equipment is always clean and sanitized.  Her staff goes beyond to assure your comfort as well and everyone is friendly, informative, knowledgeable and easy to work with.  My family members (four generations) and two friends referred have all felt the same!  They care that your glasses and/or contacts actually fit properly and work for you and your needs.  Real user, truthfully reviewed.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Dr Szeto is friendly; listens to my questions and concern with patience, and answers them with helpful details.  She cares about her patient’s eye health and well-being.  I have had other optometrists before, but I stayed with only Dr Szeto for the last fifteen plus years.  She is great!<//review>

<review>Not only the best eye doctor in the world, but also one of the best, most caring doctors I've ever met. I"ve been a patient of Dr. Szeto's and her awesome and loyal team's for over 10 years now (15 even?), and the quality and continuity of care are unbeatable. Plus, a really beautiful selection of frames.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I’ve been going to Dr. Veda for 15+ years and she is so gentle and fast, which I appreciate greatly.  She discovered a retina issue that saved me from a much worse situation.   Dr. Veda is also so warm and caring.  I also adore her office staff - Bill is the best; Elizabeth is also wonderful.<//text>

<review>Long time patient of Dr Veda SZETO. She and her staff are great. And, I always get compliments on my glasses. Office is kept super clean, selection is always kept updated. Bill Hurt is master on selecting frames, making adjustments. All are pleasant, helpful and have become friends over the years. Love them... which is why I continue to come over from Eastbay since I no longer work in SF.< /review>< user>

I have been going to Dr. Szeto for almost 20 years, and wouldn't go to anyone else. She and her staff are wonderful. From day one, she made the effort to get to know me personally and always treats me with respect. She patiently explains any questions I may have. They also have a great selection of frames and are great at helping me pick out the right frame and the right kind of prescription for my needs. I highly recommend Dr. Szeto to anyone who has eyes!<//Review>

Proficient, honest, efficient, and takes the time and care to accurately check and diagnose problem(s) and will refer to other expertise in other fields if needed.

The highest level of professionalism and service. Always friendly from the front counter to the examination room and beyond.

If you need an optometry exam or eyeglasses/contacts go see Dr Szeto Veda! Dr Szeto Veda is very professional and personable and runs an excellent optometry practice with a terrific front desk team (be sure to meet Bill, he is awesome). In addition to the medical side, this office offers a wide variety of stylish and fashionable RX eyeglass options. I have been been coming here for 13 years, always look forward to my visits, and I will continue to come here for all of my annual optometry exams and eyeglass/contact needs.< /text>

This experience was incredible I’ve never felt so comfortable in this specialty eye office and store. Felt so cared for, the staff is a A plus ! Was greeted with such warmth and sincerity. It was a Pleasure to meet Dr Veda she professional warm, kind and makes you feel so comfortable. My exam was so detailed she explained everything to me.  Before I came here I went to another office it felt rushed and short. Plus he gave me the wrong prescription for my lenses. I highly encourage anybody looking for an Eye Doctor to see  Dr Veda She Is Wonderful and so knowledgeable.
Thank you Billy & Elizabeth 😘😘😘< /text>

If you want to have a Doctor who takes your well-being at the utmost, it's Dr. Veda! I sustained an injury (fell off treadmill and banged left side of face/cheek/head) on a Saturday, sent Dr. Veda an email re: seeing floaters that evening. She immediately wrote back for an appointment on Sunday morning for dilation to assess the situation. When I arrived Sunday morning, she had her support team there to help as well. She performed a thorough exam and provided instructions and advice. I couldn't have asked for more. She's the BEST!< /review>

< Review>
My first annual exam at Dr Sveto's was the most positive experience I've ever had with in optometrist!

During the exam the optometrist took the time to explain what she was seeing in my eyes, how it was changing my vision, and what she recommended I get based on her findings. She patiently answered all my questions and didn't rush through any part of my appointment.

The office is also going to great lengths to ensure client safety during COVID-19 pandemic by thoroughly sanitizing surfaces between appointments and only seeing in one person at a time.<//Review>

Dr. Szeto has been taking care of my eyes for 15 plus years, and she is far and away the most caring and appreciated health care provider I've ever had.  I couldn't recommend her more highly.< /text>

<review>interesting and fashionable frames, fair prices, great staff, Dr. Szeto is a very good optometrist (recommended to me by my now retired former optometrist), extremely knowledgeable, very nice and personable, and I trust her completely with my eye health. Be sure to ask Bill for frame recommendations--he knows how to fit glasses perfectly, and he's got great taste! I get compliments all the time on the frames he suggested for me.< /review></record></dataset><record>

It is hard to imagine a better ophthalmologist/optometrist experience. Dr. Szeto, Bill, and Elizabeth are the best: expert, efficient, and friendly. Their advice is excellent and prices are reasonable for quality care and stylish eyewear.<//review>

< Review>
I had an amazing experience working with Billy who helped me find a staple replacement sunglass that I needed for myself. I had the tragedy of losing a pair of Saint Laurent’s in a taxi cab, but I went in to Dr. Veda’s office and found all the luxury brands I could find and I am about to move my eye-care prescription over to this office as well. Definitely a vibrant team and in a cool niche area of downtown San Francisco. I highly recommend this practitioner and the team Veda has. Thank you so much to everyone there for keeping me luxury and can’t wait to take care of my eyes there!</Review>

I’ve been coming her for +5 years and have loved it. The location is easy to get to and the service is great from the eye exam to purchasing glasses. I also like their trunk show they occasionally have with designer glasses. They offer a variety of glasses that are stylish and unique.</Review>

What can I add to this review that would make anyone trust In-N-Out Burger anymore than they already do? The answer is nothing.

This burger restaurant in Riverside has the same consistent quality that I have grown accustomed to here in Southern California.

Despite what seems like a long line, the cars move quickly and you are served quicker than expected.< /text>

Johnny took our order and was very nice & welcoming, we took a while to order but he didn’t mind! He has a very positive attitude!  It didn’t take long for our food, everything was fresh and clean. Loved loved loved this in n out, more then the one on Madison. Especially because you’re able to sit inside.<//text>

<Name>Rose Rainbow<//Name><date>1627778508710< /date><Rating>4< /Rating><review>We went around 4:30 on a Saturday and the wait time was about half an hour. It was expected of an In-and-out, but make sure to not be SUPER hungry when you get there with you family haha.
The burger was quite salty but very delicious, and I didn't put any salt on my fries so it worked out in the end 👍
I didn't know that you could ask for no salt, so I recommend to ask for no salt on your burger!
The workers seemed eager to help, even though they must've been very stressed by the long line.
Very delicious, did not disappoint</review>< Pics>

This is new location,, of course new employees so the girl didn't hear my "two double double" order of burger so 13 minutes after when my order came it was just one,, she got the new order, I ask her to make it faster so se can eat together with my spouse.. 7 minutes after I was called to receive it..
As always the same great fresh quality food.</review>

Jacob was the most amazing crew member there ever was. The food was fresh and tasted how it should. Emily says it was actually better than the other Riverside locations. We asked for two pepperoncinos and got four, amazing!

Thank you everybody</Review>

< Review>
2020,11-19/1630: I can tell the food was delicious - it looked incredible. The restaurant smelled amazing but it was a combination of the bakery next door when I had asked.

The food came out beautiful as expected. They still have it in them after all these years. Sadly, I have a tomato allergy and asked for my turkey sub without tomatoes but it was covered in tomatoes. A huge bummer so that's why I gave them three stars. Maybe next time, I'll be able to have a turkey sub or anything else, if they get my order right. It looked so good. Just like an East Coast grinder-good look. Believe me, I was so sad.

The Chef's Salad looked great. It was a huge portion. I couldn't try it but I was told it was fantastic and so was the ranch dressing.

Looking at their portions to pricing, it's great and you won't be disappointed. Next time, if we ever come back, I'd like to try the Philly Cheese Steak.< /Review>

Great food! 90% of the menu are dishes where you clearly see that the kitchen has made an truly effort in creating signature dishes. Great service from Raoul. We dined outside and it was a super spot in the middle of the Valley Village "chaos" :-)</Review>

<review>I've ordered from them twice and have been blown away both times. AMAZING value for the money, the food arrives hot and delicious, the people are incredibly nice! One of the few restaurants I know of who deliver directly where you don't need to use an app. I'll probably be ordering far too often from now on.</review><username>Michelle Glittermum<//username><Pictures>None</Pictures><Rating>5< /Rating><Date>1585866107551< /Date>< response>

So... our favorite pizza place closed and I thought I'd give this place a try. Oh... My... God! Never Will I Ever judge a book by its cover again! The eggplant parmesan was to die for, melt in your mouth, generous portions, absolutely delicious! The fettuccine Alfredo was a miracle in my mouth, and the spaghetti marinara perfect! The Italian salad was generous with plenty of veggies and finally a place that doesn't skimp on the salad dressing they send you! We also ordered the vegetarian pizza and to be honest, it was just ok. It needed more sauce, cheese, and perhaps more herbs in the sauce or somewhere. They were generous with the toppings! We don't eat meat, so I can't vouch for any other pizza, but from the other reviews on a popular food app, people love this place. They have a full menu which gives you plenty of choices. You could eat something different for a month if you came daily. Their prices are good and the service is friendly! This is our new go-to Italian/pizza place!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Everything was cooked properly, and everything stayed hot in the midst of being in an air conditioned place. And everything came with a few slices of warm, garlic bread! Honestly, can't complain about anything, totally recommend this place to anyone wanting cheap, great quality pasta!</Review>< username>

I've had 90% of this stores menu in my dining room, and up to now I have zero complaints.. Everything is on point from pastas to pizza to their subs.. The Alfredo sauce is the best and their pizza is on fleek, not too thick not too thin, just perfect. Keep up the good food guys.. BIG FAN< /Review>

Been going here over a year now, always an excellent slice of pizza. Authentic preparation and quality ingredients.   And $10 large pizzas Monday-Thursday you can't beat it.< /Text>

< review>
!!!!!!!!!!!!WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!
the Fettuccine Alfredo w/ Chicken has zero alfredo sauce!!! it is a spicy chicken pasta. I'm Italian and I thought Alfredo fettuccine would be nice and creamy not something I desperately needed water for. Also it was $13.00. A little pricy especially when your order is messed up. I will not come here again< /review>

The branch on Burbank blvd. In Noho is super skimpy with toppings
I paid $1.79 for extra pepperoni and they still put 3 pepperoni's per slice wth!
What do i have to order triple pepperoni?< /text>

<Text>Very friendly morning staff! They have one of those manually operated espresso machines where they pull the espresso shots themselves and I absolutely love it. Good sandwiches. Nice atmosphere. Overall it’s a great place for morning coffee and a quick lunch.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Lovely place with great coffee.... don't go in the morning or if you're in a hurry. It is SLOW! Takes forever to get served here. I remember Cafe Trieste across the street. They were great too, but also so slow.... they're not there anymore. I like the place,  but only when i have all the time in the world...</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Delicious Almond Croissants, Fresh yummy Bear Claws, and one of the best Fruit and Yogurt cups I have tasted. I slipped in after 3PM, and I did not have a clue they were technically closed. The (pretty) lady who assisted me was very nice, personable, and super helpful. That was my first visit and I am going back again now.</Review>

<Review>Ordered a mug of coffee and slice of carrot cake to eat inside. The coffee was horrible, tasted like it had been heating in the pot for a long time, tasted burned and unpleasant. I had to ask the barista if he was planning on making fresh coffee soon, which he did. No paying customer should ever be given coffee that is as old as I was given. The barista should keep track of that. Also, when I asked for a fork for the cake, I was given a small plastic fork- really? All in all, not a pleasant indoor experience.< /Review>< gmapID>

I stopped in while on the way to Carrizo National Monument. I spoke with Tina the owner for a while, really nice salt of the earth. She's from not far from where my Mother comes from, we talked about family and the times. The food was really good and too much to finish (I got the Hamburger). The decor is something out of time, with some quirkiness to it. I strongly without reservation recommend going here. To me its a slice of Americana that should be experienced.</review>< pictures>

This place is a must try . If you are ever in the area of Maricopa stop into Tina's Diner. We are working in Bakersfield and took the 45 minute drive to enjoy a taste of Heaven in the best meal I've had in a long time.  Tina takes pride in the food she puts out. If you leave her restaurant hungry you will never fill up. A bowl of soup ,then a salad plate(tossed salad,carrot salad, potato salad, and macaroni salad) then came a chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and a cup of peaches. Can't forget the garlic bread.
The price was very affordable.  6 of us not one dissatisfied person.  Every thing made homemade and with love. My hat off to the great taste of Heaven.  When ever I'm near Tina you won my buisness.</review>

Very nice lady, great home style food. I really didn't know what to think when I walked in but the experience could be summed up as "Lunch at grandma's house". There is no hurry, but with that sort of atmosphere, who wants to hurry?</Text>

Tina's is literally overflowing with character. Not only is the building thoroughly decorated, but Tina herself is an amazingly charismatic woman with tremendous stories of her life. Make sure to ask about how she survived as the 11th kid in a poor family in the Philippines!

The food is homemade and very delicious, with filling portions.

Depending on the season, Tina might just offer you a fresh, hand-picked guava. Take it!

Tina's is the full-spectrum antidote to the excess of chain restaurants and sanitized consumerism that plague our country. In many ways, I felt like I was back in 1910, grabbing a bite after a hard day in the oil fields and chatting with the owner.<//review>

Don't miss out on Tina's extra-special home-made hand-made sausage. Breakfast anytime make Tina's a favorite. I had an omelet. Old Dad had eggs and sausage. Fresh hash browns were crisp and delicious. A great place to eat in Maricopa. It could be the best place in town.< /Text>

<Review>This is a gem.  Quaint like yesteryear, food like your Grannie made.  Huge portions, all handmade right down to the fries and dressings.  Not sure she even owns a can opener.  Locals come by for a bite and conversation.  Like being at a hometown BBQ.  No strangers here.

<text>Wonderfully cozy, very friendly!  Fantastic food; like it was your mom or grandma cooking.  Tina will make it better than you ordered or expected.  If you leave hungry, that is your fault! Excellent value; you will definitely get your money's worth.  Tina will welcome you in and make you feel like family.  This is not a fluke; I have been several times now, and she has always treated me like family.  She will make your food to order, but it will never seem like you have to wait.

<review>This woman is one of the most wonderful people on this planet, no exaggeration. What little time you are able to spend with her during your visit will impress you but I have had the fortune of knowing her my whole life. Excellent doesn't do her justice, as far as her cooking prowess or her personality. Much Love.<//review>< pictures>

My brother and I went to this diner on our way from California to Texas. The owner was incredibly friendly and warm, and the food was amazing. I had one of the best burgers I have had in a while, and it was dirt cheap in price for what I got (Less than ten bucks for a three-patty-and-cheese burger, with all the fixings).
I would absolutely recommend this place to everyone; the food and service was amazing.<//review>

Met Tina and she really was a pleasure to be around. The food was greatly portioned and was all home cooked.  Even the mashed potatoes were freshly made. I left with plety of leftovers. If you are in the area you HAVE TO try this hidden gem. To see for yourself.  You will not be disappointed.<//review>

Nicest lady in the California valley! Worth stopping for even a cup of coffee. Good for a story or just someone to talk to. More than fair pricing and big portions.< /Review>

<text>I hope all who stop by are able to leave their troubles at the door and if they can't, no worries. Tina will help. Great food - the tuna melt I had today was delicious - and comforting conversation. It is my Maricopa oasis.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I was just a walk in customer because the drive to nearest town is approx. 10 min away!  As I enter Tinas Diner located in Maricopa,Ca. Was in dismay thinking I was in the wrong place!  No one viable or greeting you! The owner was actually sitting at a corner table and it took me a moment to realize she was not a customer herself!  They did not have anything that was on the menu and she overcharged me for what I received! Too personal too quick! Not good  social bussiness skilled at all! I will not return to diner at any time!  Nice family otherwise!</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80ea32db93e85745:0xf022cf06618090e2<//gmap_id></record>

Always a "just like home" experience.  Mama T's restaurant offers an experience that will make you feel like you're home for the holidays.  The food is always delicious and the fruit always fresh, and coffe for breakfast is hot and fresh.  What more can I say?  I love good customer service, and Mama T's offers the best in that department, that the food is so good is a plus.  I love Tina's Diner and would not mind sharing Maricopa's best kept secret with those whol love food and good treatment in a relaxed atmosphere.< /text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><username>Tom Ross</username><Date>1467747929300<//Date><text>Some years ago my wife and I were riding vintage motorcycles from Los Gatos to our home in Riverside.  Her bike was limited to 50 mph, so we rode back roads all the way, and it was really hot on Hwy 33.  We were ready to drop in the heat when we stopped at Tina's.  Now, this place is the very last biz open in this tiny old town, and we were looking at another 3 or 4 hours to get home.  I took a pic of our two bikes on a totally empty main street.

I am not exaggerating when I say that Tina saved our lives.  We are forever grateful, and my riding buddy and I will stop there this weekend on our way to and from the WSBK races in Monterey.< /text></record>

<review>The workers are extremely nice and fast. All I had was $30 and I was in desperate need of a used tire. They said no problem and took care of it. Thank you so much for your kindness and fast work.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

<Text>These guys hot my wheel lock off after proving it was my car of course...putting the extra work into the job and didn't charge for this. I did have some price fluctuations from different guys on different days...double the previously quoted price for a couple options for a used tire. But it was straightened out sorta and I got the better price. Thanks to they guy who helped me ...Issac was his name. Go see Issac at la truck and tires.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>The trips tacos were delicious but the asada tacos had no taste in the meat 😕 just disappointed in the asada tacos they really need to get good quality of meat for Carne asada and  the meat needs to be well prepared with good seasoning because it had no taste at all just disgusting.<//Text>< rating>

<text>Hola, one of the few places (maybe the only place available for a late night snackl) to eat a hot meal meaning it's served hot , not spicy unless you requested that way.  Although the location can be a little intimidating it's worth the stop. The food is fresh and ample. The service is attentive and pleasant.Try the nachos there's plenty for two people and well priced, too. Do keep in mind, not all La Villa restaurants are the same in terms of service and quality. Enjoy the food; it's filling.< /text><Name>Roman Gutierrez<//Name>< Date>

An Older Lady who was working at 11 o'clook pm yesterday had no experience in customers services or any manners while me and my wife placed our Orders...Her poor attitude made us feel uncomfterable .. We over heard her Insults/ trash talking about us while we were waiting for our food, as if we did not Speak Spanish... But of course I spoke up defending our Honor and Respect because im a Paying Costomer.. Now i know I  Rather eat at a taco truck down the street from them them because the simple fact that we were not Discriminated....Thank you an God Bless</text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Went here past 230am and was so worth it! Totally recommend as you won't be disapointed with La Villa being your only late night Taco option.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I do not know where to start. Ok I know the smell! It was horrible I could barley withstand waiting in line. It smelled like dead rodents. Also I saw the food coming out to the customers and it looked disgusting and bland. I opted for just a Jaimaica instead. The cashier stared at me said ok. And instead of just ringing me out and getting the water to get me on my way, she starts pulling orders out and packing them up with no sense of urgency. Slowest I've ever seen. I'm still waiting to get rung out maybe 5 minutes. A gentlemen comes up thinking I already ordered and asked her for a drink. She quickly rings him out. I had to just walked away. The smell and rude service was too much to bear. CALLING A HEALTH  INSPECTOR.< /review>

(Translated by Google) What a disappointment to have come to this place! Your employees lack information on how to take health and hygiene MEASURES ... the minutes that I wait for my order, I see that the cook touched his face twice, one of the cashiers washed his hands incorrectly. this crisis.

(Translated by Google) The gut tacos were cold and there was no more than a customer, there are no excuses that they were very busy, they have a good place, it was clean but they do NOT really want to and sincerely do not return, apart my 11 year old daughter ate roast tacos with
Hotcheetos and nacho cheese were good but sadly sick of the stomach.

(Original)
Los tacos de tripa estaban fríos y no avía más que un cliente , no hay excusas de que estaban muy ocupados, tienen un buen lugar ,estaba limpio pero NO le echan ganas y sinceramente no regreso,  aparte mi hija de 11años comió tacos de asada con
hotcheetos y queso de nacho estaban buenos pero se enfermo del estomago lamentablemente.😔</review>
