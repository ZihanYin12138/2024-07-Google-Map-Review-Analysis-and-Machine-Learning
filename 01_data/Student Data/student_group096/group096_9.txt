I really liked the food, it has a good price for the amount of food, the service was excellent.  I asked a few questions about the food and I was told everything that was necessary.  in all the places the attendance is essential.  everything in this restaurant was positive 👍🏽< /text>

Do not let the placement of this place throw you off from quality. Set in a mall food court, this place tops Gaby's and other Mediterranean restaurants near by.

You can order a whole grilled mackerel.

Their salmon falls apart as you bite into it. My mouth was in shock as I am used to tough salmon from kebab houses.

Got the Greek salad, delicious if you like tang and zest as their dressing is has a. delightful light balsamic taste with added blended olives.

Prepare to wait about 15 minutes for your food. Each dish is prepared with each order. The meat is grilled fresh where you can see it.

Take home spices and hot sauces available.< /text>

Was not worth the money! Asked for the Garlic spread and they said they had it. What they gave me was Chimmichurri in a a small dipping cup. Chicken n Tabouleh only was not worth $15.00....won't be back. Chicken was tasteless.<//text>

This food was ok, but I expect more flavor. There was nothing to put on the meat so it made the meal a little dry. Some hummus would have made this meal better. I only saw the hummus after i ordered. Also the hot sauce was franks, i would have rather some kind of authentic hot sauce. Over it was ok.<//Review>

Two things I love... tangy and spicy. One other that I’ve recently added: healthy. Ive been doing my best to avoid the typical junk that I put in my body so I tried something a little different. This place is pretty good. The menu pictures will make your mouth water. A lot to choose from. The salad bar looked so so but the tomato and cucumber salad was delicious! One bite and I was in love. I would’ve bought a whole container of it! Very light and refreshing taste. The chicken kabob that I ordered was tasty. Nothing to die for. The taste of charbroiled chicken with a bit of lemony flavor. The rice also had a bit of a tangy zest to it. The roasted tomato that it was paired with in addition to the pita slices was a good offset and/or balance. Overall I recommend trying it. Only minus one star because while I was waiting, one of the servers had a disagreement with a customer and started back and forth. The customer said she preferred salad instead of rice and the server insisted that she should have asked before hand. The customer said she shops here all the time and always does ask before hand but that it must not have been communicated. Even though the customer was a bit snappy in my opinion, being a customer service rep myself, I would never go back and forth with a customer. Wrong or not, you ave to hold your composure and diffuse the situation in the most cordial manner possible, particularly when other customers are watching. The server definitely popped an attitude and gave some smart remarks when she could have smiled, said “I’ll take care of you”, and asked that the customer could just make sure the order taker heard her clearly so that they could make sure to have her order perfect next time and “thank you”.<//text>

I have been to the many Mediterranean far and near me, Massis is one of the tops. Two extra long sewer of beef Kaboudeh is less than $9 & it comes with delicious basmati rice, cucumber tomato salad + large broiled tomato & pita bread & boneless chicken kabob for less than $10 and it's delicious!< /text>

I came in on Friday and decided to go with the chicken salad with a side of hummus.  I would say that for what I got, the cost is moderately priced.  Not overly expensive but not economical either.
The lettuce was pretty bland, definitely not enough dressing to really flavor the dish. The chicken was good though.  Hummus was ok.  The pita was pretty stiff. If anything I would suggest heating up the pita or making it fresh for the guests and adding additional items to the salad to make it interesting. There were some tomatoes, olives etc but the salad seem to be just thrown together with out any sort of real interest.
Service was unfriendly and the order took a long time.
On a plus side they give you a order device that vibrates when your order is ready.  It took about 20 minutes for a chicken salad with one person in front of me and they didnt seem too busy but thats an outsider prospective.<//review>

<review>The fish I ordered was tasty. But it was such a small piece, and all broken up. (I will try to attach a picture.) I noticed 'others' plates had a nice piece of fish laying on a bed of fries or rice. I ordered number 17D and expected the beets to come with the dish, well I told the young lady I wanted the beets, she said, "what I gave you taste best". I looked at her on the cell and walked away. I don't think I will spend my money there again. For the record, I'm black and they were all Mexicans.( If you see my first statement, they did not list my full review.)</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<date>1621038120420< /date><Rate>4</Rate><Text>Was super busy when we came to hit balls the other night. Quality problem to have I suppose. Would love to have some real turf options in the future but otherwise a decent place to hit balls. They don’t stay on the islands much which is why the 4 stars. Perfect hits onto the islands bounce into the water😩. Kinda takes the fun out of hitting onto the island. But fun nonetheless.</Text>< Pics>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Wide-open, lake front driving range with bays along the Southside of the lake. Good at l setup for covid-19. The bays seen further apart than most driving ranges. It a good place to see how far you can hour a ball with our the roll. There's a mix of stationary and floating (boats) islands as target practice. Lots of fun. I drive 25 minutes to get here.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOin9s2CC_oFsj360y2UpYOdSCjJPxR9f_PiQqj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyz8IjowY-nuGiRzGni7vuPBwijXvkJj0Rz3Lo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd70f2a0bd111:0x96c67c3d1db9e584< /Gmap_id></record>

Decent prices on balls. Renovation in process should look nice when completed. Covered mats in sections, with plenty of seating areas when compared to other ranges. Water targets help to improve your short iron shots. Range balls made for water do not have proper flight as a regular golf ball when driving.</Review>

From talking to the staff, it's under new management and they've improved the place and will continue to keep it cleaner than what it used to be. I will come by again to hit some golf balls here and bring some friends too.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Heard there’s a new owner just before covid. They’re making the place look really nice. New targets, some new mats, heaters, benches, bag stands, club rentals, new landscape, etc. Will definitely come back.< /text>

Great little driving range to practice your swings! A scenic lake with small floating islands, hence the name. Balls can be a little bit on the expensive side, but the cool breeze and atmosphere are worth the price! A perfect medium ground between something new and exciting yet not too pricey. Definitely worth checking out</Review>

Its a fun place to hit some balls. Don't feel bad if your not hitting the distance marks though, because they are not accurate! I like trying to land in the boats that are floating around.< /Review>

< Review>
Very unique driving range, where you hit balls into a large body of water like a small lake. Your targets are object in the lake ie island, carrier, boats, mount...and each has its own yardage. Personally i think its much better than typical ranges. Costs of practice balls are about the same as every other place out there. I would be a regular if it can be a bit closer. Would recommend and would come back whenever i have a chance.< /Review>

If you like hitting off mats great place. Putting green is too quick but still good for practice (if you play courses with a 15 on the Stimp Meter). A plus is the free chipping area which it seems not many people know about, great for short game practice. Kind of like a par 3 6 hole course, would be better if you were able to hit off grass instead of mats in the tee boxes though.< /text>

Must wear a mask, 6' distancing, must pay by credit/debit card (no cash) for pre-filled bucket of balls. Pro-shop not open. Restrooms are open.< /review>

This is a great place to practice your golf swing and understand the distance of your club. With your target is an island floating in the water, it really give you the narrow view of the fairway. At least for me it works that way. The chipping area works your swing as well, very private. Their membership price, pays for itself. And if you are golf fanatics like I am it's worth it.< /text>

Good place to "swing them sticks". Lots of floating targets to gauge distance. Mats only,but clean facility with a golf shop,putting green & seperate chipping area. Price is good $8 for medium bucket(80 balls) & 10 large=110 balls. Barry is 'da man!

If you're not aiming for the islands than maybe you can hit the boat, either the anchored one or the boat with the guy scooping the balls from the water... about $10 for a large bucket.

<Text>Not a bad place. Pond setting is nice. Large bucket is $10. Free coffee but I wouldn't drink it unless I make it. Nice outdoors. Could be fun on rain but only half have tents.
The place is a bit signed down but still looks ok overall. Nice scenery even if it's right next to freeway exit.
Came here twice already and will come here again. Place also has putting area to practice your short game.<//Text><GmapID>0x80dcd70f2a0bd111:0x96c67c3d1db9e584</GmapID><resp>None< /resp><user>111062893256942179806< /user><pics>None</pics>< Date>

So much FUN!!!!
Its great to be able to see where your balls land as they splash in the water. Of course that isnt the objective. If your accurate enough you will land them on the islands.
Im not so i enjoy the splash.
Will absolutely visit here again.</text>

You can visually experience the actual distance you hit your balls, like how far it goes comparing the slices, pulls, hooks, pushes, thin shots,  and whatever. Actually I think I like JUST watching it SPLASH.<//review>

Nice place. Well maintained. Fun to try and hit the islands and boats in the water. We visited from out of town and they had clubs both in adult and child sizes to use free of charge.<//text>

<review>Love this place...... i go and take my youngest with me in a stroller and he enjoys the shade and looking at the water and all the birds in it. Free coffee and an awesome chipping area.....the only draw back is the balls don't fly the true distance of your clubs because there floater balls......even with that it's one of my favorite ranges...</review><UserId.>116443184308678762291< /UserId.><Response>None<//Response>< Pictures>

Pretty horrible for the price. You feel like you’re in Los Angeles. Not OC. Go to Oak Creek. It’s a beautiful club for basically the same price for a bucket of balls.< /text>

Open late. Water splash helps to see where your golf ball lands. Easily accessible/Right by the 57 freeway. Great place to practice your swing while your vehicle is being serviced at the dealerships across the street.<//text>

(Translated by Google) Very special driving range. Several small islands on the water allow you to practice with accuracy. The batting area is a bit rude. Not every compartment has a partition, the rest are not bad.

(Original)
很特別的練習場，水上的幾個小島讓你練習準度，擊球區有些簡陋，不是每個區隔間有區隔，其餘都還不錯。< /Review>

< Review>
I have given Marian hospital five stars based only on the visual appeal of the hospitals grounds.  Luckily I have not had an  opportunity to receive care for myself since the new facility came online a few years ago.  Sadly, many of my friends and loved ones
have needed care here.  During those times when I am visiting people who are receiving care I often take the time to wander around the beautiful grounds and find that the well maintained trees and plants along with the sculpture of St. Francis and others brings peace and comfort in times of sadness or concern.  Thanks to those who work to keep all of us all healthy and to those who maintain the hospital grounds.  May you and your families  enjoy good health and a long prosperous life.< /Review>

Had a bad experience... unfortunately the staff seemed like nothing is happening! I took my mother cause a horrible pain and we got there at 1145pm and 140am still no chance to be taken inside... it was not as busy... staff seemed cold towards all incoming patients!! For I don't expect them to be in tears but at least be more compassionate!! Good attitude goes long ways!!<//Review>

My Physical Therapist, Mary is the Best! She listens and made me feel very comfortable. I’ve had some issues with Doctors that just go through the motions but didn’t really help so I was leery at first but Mary quickly proved she wasn’t like that at all.I would recommend Her to anyone! Everyone there was very nice and genuinely care.<//review>

Horrible service this day, it was full house. if could give no stars I would but the app won't let me. Waited minimum two hours if not more to get them to see my mom took her there for stroke symptoms, there excuse was no rooms with monitors available. Back in the 80s they saved my life there, god bless them those were other times.<//Text>

<Text>Was very please how organize the whole process of getting vaccination on January 23, 2021 at 1 p.m. It took 1 hour and 17 minutes from the start of line to end after vaccination waiting for 15-20 minutes at the very last tent making sure there was no reaction. My only regret was I wasn’t able to be on a wheelchair when I hardly couldn’t walk, it wasn’t till a nice staff helper saw me almost falling down that she helped me and luckily grabbed a wheelchair nearby to put me on it. I only wished that I could have had my husband with me when I started on the line because my husband is my caretaker, but the lineman said I’m using a cane my husband can wait for me when done. So my husband went back to our Van till I was done. My thanks to the fireman who helped me push the wheelchair to my waiting van and all of a sudden surprised heavy down of rain came down on us! Thankful my husband was able to move the van closer to the last tent and both the guard and my husband helped put me back in the van! My husband John Michael Gagarin is 70 years old and I wished he could had been with me the whole time. I beg you please to let him have his vaccine, I’ve called multiple times and left messages but still never ever got a call back. Thank you for listening and thank you for a very well organize vaccine process. 👍👏👏👏👏👏< /Text>< Pictures>

Marian had the most organized event I have ever been to.  Efficient, smooth, no noticeable glitches.  It obviously was ran by a nurse!
I was there 2 days with 2 different people.  But both days it ran smooth as silk.
Your set up plans should be shared all over the nation .< /review>

Wanted to give two stars because Dr. Paluay deserves better, but I am unfortunately forced to seek medical care elsewhere & I don't want anyone else financially burned the way I have been by this low class hospital. It is morally reprehensible, not to mention unprofessional, to intentionally obfuscate where billing is concerned & then site "privacy" as if a courtesy service is being provided. We live in a capitalist society, grow up people..  I am entitled to receipts prior to payment, medical or not. In this country an exchange of money is a transaction of services & nothing more - you cannot proclaim to care for your patients & yet inconvenience them at the same time - you do not exist in both worlds in this country & we are not ignorant of this fact.

Their billing department doesn't even send notice of whether or not they've made a claim, but even worse, we should not be required to request itemized receipts. If you're going to play that game where you pretend I'm getting SUCH a deal by paying "early" (you know, prior to you even attempting to collect with my insurance), there is no reason I should have to jump through hoops to receive the confirmations I deserve. You aren't protecting me, you're scamming me. Protecting me would be caring about my best interest, you are a business that just charged me 3 times what a normal lab would & then tried to get the money from me first without even mentioning or attempting an insurance claim! Lesson learned a guess though; all companies that do everything, "in-house" always seem to charge more & yet have poor quality staff, don't they? Thanks for the lesson though.

Update: They didn't even attempt to submit a claim for my husband's bill & when I received word from our insurance about MY claim, I only owed the co-pay because Well Woman's visits are covered almost entirely under my insurance (obviously, considering it's preventative).

I don't care if I'm dying, I will NOT use this medical center & I will avoid all other Dignity Health facilities as best as I possibly can (shouldn't be too hard when we move back to LA County in a few months). You people are the absolute worst & I'm not giving you anymore of my energy.< /text><date>1618941172204<//date></record>

I was able to receive my covid vaccination at their tent clinic on Church St. The organization of the process, the kindness and knowledge of all the staff, and the speed at which we went through the process, 20 minutes, was remarkable.  Yes, 20 minutes from pulling into our reserved parking space, to returning to our car. Thank you so very much Dignity Health/Marian staff, in this crazy year you showed your true professionalism.< /Text>

I recieved my first vaccination at Marian Regional Medical Center.  The process was so smooth that although I was excited to get the vaccine the experience was uneventful.  Staff was friendly and helpful and the whole process including 15 minutes of sit time after my injection took 30 minutes or less.</Text>

<review>My experience at Merian Hospital has always been great till 2020 when they joined DIGNITY HEALTH.  Merian Hospital is a Preferred Provider with Blue Shield insurance BUT DIGNITY HEALTH IS NOT.   I’m a senior, Dignity Health bill Medicare But not Blue Shield.  After 6 phone calls to Blue Shield and to Dignity Health finally got the bill paid.   Warning; if you have Blue Shield as your 2nd insurance, DIGNITY HEALTH WILL NOT bill Blue Shield Insurance so the charges above Medicare becomes out of network.   So now I need to find a blood drawing lab that IS  NOT part of DIGNITY HEALTH.   Nita W<//review>< Pictures>

Well Marian has showed there true colors again... They had a ECMO device bought by
one of the affluent family trusts that have been
gracious enough to donate iPads for families to keep in contact during COVID.
With all the billboards up and down Highway 101 and patting themselves on the back for having specialty services while being on hold and in the local papers of supposed advanced care, Marian obviously wasn’t interested in buying ECMO devices to save the  lives of the local community citizens, but as soon as someone else was willing to pay for the device they decided it would except the free offer and then publicize like they were all interested in the device use. So when you see the fancy billboards up and doen the highway that they spend thousands upon thousands of dollars per month and paying rent on the old Valley hospital that is not  in use ( the rent is appox. $100,000.00 per month ) .
Possibly so no other hospitals can easily come into the area. Thank goodness Santa Barbara Cottage hospital has opened an Urgent Care on North Broadway and soon to open in Orcutt on Clark Ave. near the 101 highway.
There is quite a large number of people that believe the big donors should donate elsewhere as Marian is just a corporate so-called nonprofit establishment and if you look at the salaries paid you’d have to wonder if there right.
If donating helps purchase equipment to save lives because Marian isn’t willing too then its a good thing that theres some rich uneducated
families.
But remember how many local residents have
passed away and per the newspaper article the ECMO device will save lives then why was Marian unwilling to spend the money ? The ECMO device reimbursement rate will be very high and corporate will love the revenue that the device brings in ( probably will get bonuses )
So when you see the religious statues and tower please remember the lives that was lost and the Sisters that started the hospital would be furious as to how the funds are misappropriated.
If you see hospitals indicating they are award
winners from companies like Leapfrog and Healthgrades, if you look into how they come about receiving awards they are basically bought as they don’t go into the facilities.
One staff member shared that they go on and give high reviews just to up the ratings.
If you ask around you’ll see most residents of the area will go to Santa Barbara for their procedures as the quality is far superior. Luckily
for Marian the staff have to use the hospital for
procedures.</Review>

<Review>We tried calling ahead to the ER to let them know I was bringing my fiancée in with 103.3 temperature with chills and cough and several underlying conditions including heart disease and lung issues from chemotherapy and radiation. For more than 20 minutes no one answered. Really? We arrived and ER waiting room was not busy, and several nurses and employees were behind the desk. No reason someone could not answer. Then while waiting, when someone did arrive, they would sign an electronic pad with attached peb and put hands on the counter and not one employee attempted to sanitize anything. Is this normal policy or lazy employees? Just want to warn everyone to be careful.</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I had a miscarriage in June 2020 & went to the hospital at the advise of my doctor. I was repeatedly promised my baby was fine & healthy, that my pregnancy would proceed normally & I would get to hold my baby at the end, despite the ultrasound clearly showing a blighted ovum (gestational sac but no baby), heavy bleeding, painful cramps, & generally the miscarriage exactly mimicking the first miscarriage I had a few months prior. I had my symptoms brushed off, told I couldn't receive help for the miscarriage since I was definitely not having one. I was told I was confused about when I had conceived, despite keeping track of it very closely & I actually conceived 2 weeks later than I thought, despite not having intercourse anywhere near that time. I was promised I would only pay my copay & then was asked to pay more than that in order to be allowed to leave - with the promise I would be reimbursed for any amount over the copay. In the last 7 months, I've received many bills far above my copay & no reimbursement. I never received an itemized bill as requested. I cannot get a call back. I have been in the process of disputing the bills for 7 months. After asking for a dispute form repeatedly & told that things would be on hold for a month & then we can reassess & nothing would go to a collection agency, they sent everything off to a collection agency. The form clearly shows they sent everything to the collection agency within 24 hours of this promise to not send to the collection agency & to finally send me the form to formally dispute. I hadn't even received the form to fill out when they sent everything to a collection agency. I've continued to be lied to, my health disregarded, my symptoms not listened to or taken seriously & I received no actual care when I sought care. I find this to be the most unprofessional of any hospital I have ever worked with on a professional level or visited for personal reasons. I would recommend not seeking help or driving over an hour to a different hospital over ever going to this ER for anything. They are not doing the public any type of good service & they are definitely doing the public a huge disservice. (Jan.)

Edit: I see they have responded, same response I have gotten for over 7 months. (Feb.)

Edit 2: Luckily I took a photo scan of the dispute form before I sent it in so I sent that form to the collection agency, same day as original review. The collection agency promised to take it up with the hospital because they said they never never had this type of issue before - I finally got someone's attention. They called me. They told me that 2 other people would need to call me about this issue - all 3 of them would need me to go over every detail (which is not easy to do but I said I would be willing to do so). I had 1 other person call me, not 2. I had to go over every detail & answer many questions for each person. I was promised that they would take the bill back from the collection agency, combine the many different bills & that the hospital would cover it all....FINALLY. They said they cannot provide any type of confirmation but said I would get a letter in 4-6 weeks letting me know I didn't owe anything to anyone anymore & I would likely continue to receive things between now & then saying I did owe & to ignore those. (February)

Edit 3: I have still not received anything from Marian in the mail. I did receive a refund of my payment from when I was in the ER that I had to pay in order to be allowed to leave. BUT I also received a notice that 3 bills were once again set off to a collection agency. I called the collection agency & they are once again setting up an investigation. I called Marian yesterday & they promised me someone would call me back. No one has called me back. (March)

Edit 4: I've been leaving messages & getting the run around for the past month. It has now been 10 months since I went to the ER and still I'm dealing with this. No letter confirmation, no one calling me back, 3 bills still on hold at collections. Wish I could give negative stars.

The experience was very good. Well organized. One problem, no one was very definite about when I would be able to receive the 2nd shot.  This business about being able to wait up to 6 months is not reasuring. It does not coinside with all the info put out there by the medical experts. I'm afraid it will be too long in between shots and I'll have to start all over again. I called the hospital but their explanation was certainly not helpful. I hope I get some answers soon.
Thank You< /Text>

<gmapID>0x80ec6c8cb133b971:0x28883595b2c44a23</gmapID><Date>1609554511898<//Date><Review>Most of the staff has been excellent. (Only reason I gave two stars.) However, maintenance and security ARE issues. Wife had a baby during Covid. They won't let the spouse back in after they leave. So sleeping at the hospital, they provided a junk pull out chair couch. Completely tweaked my back because it is absolute junk, not flat, not put together correctly and missing screws. After several days of complaining they brought in another hospital bed.

Another issue is they have no where to store personal items, except in an open hallway, while your baby is born. The thermostat in the room after delivery was going hot/cold/hot/cold. It was falling off the wall. After 3 days of them promising to have someone fix it, I had enough. I pulled it, rewired it correctly and then left it hanging as it was, as it is broken. I can't believe that those types of temperature changes are conducive for patient healing, or the health of a new born.

I have food allergies, they did make an attempt to accommodate that. Only problem was they would only bring me about 600 calories of food each supposed meal. All they could offer above that was cheese sticks. Or to have someone deliver food.

I know it is Covid but seriously... This hospital is very lacking in personal security, can't seem to maintenance their rooms, or provide sleeping arrangements that are acceptable for the spouses. If you have food allergies, do not count on them being able to adequately feed you.

Definitely never coming back! French hospital is far superior to this facility.

EDIT: Seems they do monitor the Google ratings. Not 30 minutes after I posted this, they at least sent someone to fix the thermostat. It is now on the wall correctly, but still not working correctly.</Review></record>

I would reccomend going ANYWHERE but here if you can. I went in with left side pain. And was sent out with the very simple diagnosis of back pain and a scrip for ibuprofen. The doctor talked to me as if all I wanted was pain meds. I was,  and still am a week later in pretty major pain. He suggested I might have kidney stones and I had a CT scan. He popped his head in the room and Said the CT was clear we will send you home with a prescription of naproxin (ibuprofen). I said I'm in a lot of pain...thats the only thing you think it could be? He seemed frustrated that I would challenge his diagnosis...he says ok we will try something else and walks out of the room. He had ordered an ultrasound. I'm not really sure why but a nurse came in after the ultrasound and said he was standing in for the doctor to give me the results from the ultrasound...he said something to the nature of... since you aren't in agreement with the doctor, he sent me. I was told ultrasound was clear and this time given exit paperwork stating I had a lumbar sprain. I've continued to be in pain since I left. Just yesterday I logged into my account to look for myself at the imaging reports. I HAVE DIVERTICULITIS!! It's clearly stated on the CT report in the conclusion section. After a quick Google because I obviously have no idea what that means...all my complaints/symptoms match, which makes perfect sense...oh and it clearly states DO NOT take naproxin/ibuprofen which is the med he offered for my pain. If the doctor would have spent a little more time...I could have been on my way to feeling better already. If untreated this could have turned into a need for surgery. Please I urge you don't go here! And if you must...please advocate for yourself and double check your doctors work.  I can't imagine how many patients like me, left in pain with no answers... to only get worse after leaving and needing to spend more money and time with another doctor to get answers.<//Text>

My personal experience at Marian Regional emergency room has not always been Pleasant. I suffer from a very damaged cervical region of my back and I had not gotten any kind of pain relief can any doctor anywhere due to pre-existing conditions. So, that means if I go to the emergency room I am really really hurting! Take all that and couple it with the trauma of losing my mother and having PTSD from it all and flashbacks of the emergency room, it takes an act of God for me even want to go there. This last time I was at Marion I was in tears entertain and my blood pressure was through the roof and I was stop. At the kindness of the doctor that treated me that that day, he treated me like a human being. This is not always been the case at Marion so I want to give kudos to dr. Schwartz for helping me< /review>

We were very impressed with how well organized the Vaccination was. It began with help getting parked. It was raining and parking personnel used a large umbrella to get us to the Registration table. The Helpers there answered all questions and assisted with the paperwork. We were then moved on to the Vaccination tent. The shots were painless and quick ... the PAs, RNs, INterns, and Doctors were so caring and helpful in explaining every step in the vaccination process. We were the moved on to the Waiting area to ensure we had no reactions. There was coffee, watesnacks small snacks. The entire process took about about 35 minutes. Looking forward to receiving our 2nd vaccine next week.. THANK YOU DIGNITY ... JOB WELL DONE!!!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Was not going to rate this place but after my last visit I was shocked with the treatment my mother and I received. Went in around midnight because my mother was experiencing symptoms of a heart attack. First off the nurses at the ER are extremely rude. As we were waiting they were just on their phones and chitchatting with the security guards, which leads me to my second point. I witness a security guard tackling down a  harmless teenager with extreme and excessive force while the nurses just watchEd and one even smiled. That is not acceptable and I wouldn’t be surprised if a law suit happens against the maltreatment from the workers to the patients. Lastly I over heard nurses talk about “ looking up” on the internet the symptoms of a patient. If you are a nurse at an ER you must know your job and how to do it. I don’t trust this place with non of my family member’s health. If other people are considering to go to this hospital save your self the maltreatment and attitude from the staff and go somewhere else.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1607359248019, 'text': 'Good day, Esther.

I was hesitant about being admitted because of the current Covid situation, but the doctors highly recommended I stayed so I could get further tests done the following day. If I left, those important tests would not be available to me at the hospital as an outpatient.
I was moved into the okd section of the hospital.
My room was quite,. I was very surprised that the Covid patients were throughout the hospital, thinking they probably had been isolated to one area of the  hospital.
Because of that information, I tried to keep my door to my room closed as much as possible.
The care I received was wonderful.
The day nurses were exceptional and I observed very generous act of kindness by the nurses fir a dementia patient in the next room that was distraught. She went and watched a tv show with him, talked with him, and gave him some personal time to help settle his anxiety. It was so kind and it did not go unnoticed.
The evening nurse , Taylor, was also gentle and kind as she entered the room in the middle of the night to do the needed vital checks.
I have no hesitation about recommending or if needed  to return to the hospital in the future.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1611356587030, 'text': 'Thank you, Rocky!

I came in thru the ER on 10/26/20 , I was horrified and thought I was having a heart attack . Scared, anxious and in pain , the compassion and quick care I was given was excellent! Sam. Rosa, Ken, Peter , Dahlia I believe were the names of my ER nurses. I came in at about 6:50 am right as shift change was about to happen. These nurses worked amazingly as a team to see that I was taken care of ! ( I think Ken, nightshift started my IV before be left , very nice and gentle technique! Dr. Novan?? Was my admitted Dr, over the next couple days she was working to find out what
was going . Excellent Care, Dr Mcloskey took over and eventually there was a diagnosis! She is amazing as well!! Here are names I scribbled down to thank at a laltet date . Julissa, Aman, Marianna.

She was given excellent attention from the 4th floor staff including Alexa, Matthew, Lori and Vanessa. I want to thank everyone who assisted her with bathroom habits, nutrition and general comfort. It matters. Good on you, Marian Regional Center!!< /review>< pictures>

I was in Emergency Saturday night to take my son to get a narcotic drug prescription. The doctor couldn't believe all the issues he had gone through because of a hospital negligence he had experienced in another state. Well Monday morning he was on his way back to ND and he had blood in his urine, he called his doctor in ND and told him to have emergency check him out before he leaves. Well after the doctor cleared him to go ahead and travel back my wife told me she upset with a male nurse. What my wife did was dropped off my son at the door while she went to find a parking space. As she walked in she found my son walking to the room where he he gets his blood pressure checked and as she passed the male nurse she overheard him complain to another nurse that my son was a drug abuser that was there the night before getting a fix and back again getting more drugs. I asked my wife why didn't she say anything to me before and she said she knew I would confront them on it, which would of been true. I have had bad experiences here and don't like making bad reviews but this finally warranted a bad review. This hospital needs to talk with their people. If they have issues with customers or feel they want to denigrate customers then they need to go into a closed room where no one is able to listen. Marian hospital has good people, but for one or 2 people to ruin a batch of good personal, well is it worth it.< /review>

<text>I was in the E.R. On July 5th. I went in for vomiting nausea. The nurse that I had did not wear gloves or a mask and Physically assaulted me. I have wounds from her nails digging into my skin. I'm a diabetic and hope I don't get an infection. The young short chubby security guard I think his name was Matthew also assaulted me by Grabbing my beard and slamming my head repeatedly and broke one of my teeth. I tried calling to report them to a director and left a message. The discharge Pharmacist called me back. I started to go off on him then realized he wasn't who I needed to talk to. Still waiting to hear back. I'm wanting to press charges for the assault. I will never return to this hospital and do not recommend anyone to go here unless you want to be hurt more than when you went in . I give MINUS 5 Stars... UPDATE I was told nothing and promised the medical report so I could have said nurses name along with the security guard that were involved with the assault. Still waiting for an email or phone call but nothing going to the D.A. office Monday morning also seeking a lawyer< /text>< user>

I informed the hospital I wanted to be seen in ER room and want to confirm medi-cal from Kern county would be sufficient. I had medi-cal card number and rep on phone was saying I can't be seen without card and go to Kern county where its issued to receive new card (which is mailed out). What if my visit was life threatening. Last time I went to this hospital I was told "we don't help your kind." That was approx a year ago.</Review>< pictures>

Still trying to get the billing to send the billing with proper coding to correct insurance.  The E.R. visit was in June 2019 & now February 2020.  The billing office was zero help!  The Doctors & lab all billed correctly, only the hospital can't seem to get it right.</Review>

I am thrilled that Marian hospital brought Dr.Brent Gidney on board as an expert in the field of heart ablation. Dr.Gidney was able to perform an ablation on my heart which was successful in restoring my heart to a regular heartbeat. I thank God , Marian hospital, Dr.Gidney, and his team for bringing healing to my heart. Praise God  ! If your heart is in afib(irregular heartbeat), I would encourage you to come to Marian hospital and make an appointment with Dr.Gidney and hopefully you will experience what I did. Again thanks so much for your medical excellence.<//review>

Marian has sure gone down hill since the sisters quit running the place, now its just big business, but you
wealthy community members that like to show off
how much money you have ( trust fund fools ) keep
attending the fund raisers, the 30g concert tickets
really helped out ( bonus' for the big wigs ) but it
sure made some people look like fools, its an ongoing joke around the facility.
Radiology doctors have left,  the best OR director
is now gone, she'll be better off. The caring CEO was
replaced a couple years ago, shame cause she liked
the staff concerns on patient safety and welcomed
staff input.
Infectious disease is a major issue and there are
some serious issues going on at Marian. Keep an
eye out on social media as the law firms are
checking into the issues.
Will post more issues as they are getting reported
by staff, thank you caring staff for your concerns.

When you see an ad or freeway billboard just
laugh cause there a joke.

If possible head South to Santa Barbara to Cottage
hospital if you want great care and a focus on patient safety. They take staff concerns serious.

Oh and check out your favorite social media sites
for upcoming updates.

Take care and stay safe my friends,

<text>Absolutely gorgeous facilities.  Archetechture superb.  Very well secured for safety of patients and staff.  A walking path.  Beautiful fountains and sculptures.  Very quiet and quaint like home.  Like a living room.  Not to mention the easily accessible electronic car charger ports.  Wonderful place. Can feel the love and spirituality.< /text>< gmap_id>

I wish that the induction process was smoother. You’re “on-call” once you’re placed on the list and your date can change based on priority. I went into labor on my own waiting for an induction...which I guess is a good thing however I waited in the list for several days before then. Triage in labor is slow. Mother baby rooms are great once you have the baby... nurses keep checking on you every 5 minutes. Was more tired there than at home bc Everytime I Close my eyes someone was showing up in the room. Wish that the state was more relaxing for moms. Labor is Tiring and sometimes we just want to sleep.< /review>

My wife Kathy came into the ER Saturday night with chest pain.  Determination was made bypass surgery was needed.  Surgery was completed and now she is in recovery; we hope she can go home Monday.  EVERYONE ..... EVERYONE; from housekeeping too nurses, technicians and surgeons have been “GREAT”. Our experience has been WONDERFUL, yes there were a few small problems; but with the number of people receiving services; you have to expect some. But, staff consistently are asking how they can improve services.  Staff made sure my family and I were informed on my wife’s progress and convertible. “Thank You”< /Text>

This hospital is the worst! There are a few nice people but for the most part, they all suck. The people in the ER especially the doctors, don’t seem to care or want to help anyone. Just in it for money. They tell you to go see your regular doctors but then you can’t even get into to see your regular doctors. Our medical system needs a huge overhaul! They aren’t helping patients, they just want money and insurance money. They don’t actually want to do any kind of real work or help. It’s so sad. Every time I go there I get the run around. The staff when you first come in are pretty nice and helpful, but the doctors? Wow how pathetic. Inside the hospital, most of the areas aren’t that bad. Lab and other areas have been really nice. Honestly it’s just the Emergency room. I’ve heard so many terrible things about this place and it’s so true. I also know a lot of people who refuse to go to MARIAN. I am also one of those. Only the emergency room. I will drive to another hospital.< /text>

It was cold and awful they ask me what I did and didn’t want but couldn’t get that right no matter what . They really need better food avail .

Absolutely shocking and terrifying place. The staff is actively cruel to pretty much everyone. It’s a kafkaesque scene in the ER. Building is falling apart, security guards are dressed like they’re at a military base and nurses and clerks snicker at suffering patients openly. Waited 3 hours in the ER for a serious condition. Do not under any circumstances come here. This is the kind of place where people without empathy find jobs.< /review>

Okay. So we went in to get my dear friends shots and we were being forced to answering questions such as “ does your child play with guns” “ have your child some drugs such as cocaine “ we don’t find those needed and they were FORCING us to fill out this sheet of questions. They began to be rude to us and tell me what I can and cannot do! This is not professional and disrespectful. After refusing to do the things they wanted me to do, they treated me terribly without respect. I was in here for 2 hours just for my friends shots? Unbelieveable. And they have told me “ nicely “ to stop recording, when I was never recording. never will I come back. 1 star rating!< /Text>

Wish I could give ZERO stars. Spent 4 hours in the er tonight. I waited 3 hours in the waiting room, while everyone else got called, only to find out they forgot about me. Then when I asked if they forgot me, I was told there was a room ready as they frantically dug to the bottom of the stack to find my lost paperwork. Then they put me in the supply closet with no bed, where I waited 45 more minutes to be seen. Finally they sent a physician's assistant, not even a real doctor, to diagnose me. She informed me she would put in my orders for treatment immediately since I'd been waiting so long, and was in a lot of pain. Then proceeded to the next three patients before ever turning in my orders. This place is a JOKE. Next time I'm just going to make the hour drive to Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital where they don't neglect and mistreat their patients.</text>

<Text>I waited 3 hours to be treated like garbage by the doctor. Who told me that basically it wasn’t an emergency that my arm was going numb once a day. She talked to me like I was dumb and I had no right to be here. Super not thrilled with any of the experience. To add.... currently going on 17 minutes waiting on discharge papers. There’s like .. 3 people in here. Not understanding why any of this is taking so long. I would appreciate a “hey it’ll be a few more mins” etc. it’s 9 pm, I haven’t eaten because they instructed me not to, and I’m tired.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>You guys want to talk about jokes for hospitals come on down to arkansas if u think marians bad just wait till you get a load of the docs out here, I was born and raised in santa maria EVERY TIME I went to Marian they found the problem and did their best to fix it they took my pain seriously and did their best to accomadate me especially doctors like diomidica and Teaford i moved to arkansas and my health started to rapidly decline and the docs here misdiagnosed VISIBLE cysts in the scar tissue in my uterus and it took them six (count them SIX) c.t scans to find my inflamed duodenum even one of their own doctors couldnt believe the radiologist missed it six times, they also misdiagnosed my sisters broken back said she pulled muscles after a car accident and a VISIBLE HERNIA in my step mother i think doctors that cant make it anywhere else come here and don't get me started on the nurses there are only a few exceptions to that statement, appreciate the access you have to quality medical care and knowledgeable doctors cuz as I said I lived there and i give it a 10 to arkansas 1< /Review>< Date>

I will start by saying my next baby will born elsewhere! Went in after my water broke they sent me home saying I must have peed I knew that was not the case they wouldn’t listen wouldn’t give me an ultrasound to check my fluid levels. Went home contractions kicked in. Went back my Dr met me there and she made them admit me. After having mixed experiences with the nurses some were great some not so much. I eventually developed an infection .... why you ask from my water being broken too long..... (insert eye roll) so if they would have listened to me this could have been avoided?!? Cool! My sons heart rate shot up, which led to an emergency c-section. Thank god my son was perfectly healthy! I had to have an unnecessary surgery because they didn’t listen. My Dr’s were Dr Yin & Dr. Crisp Dr. Crisp performed my c-section he was amazing the whole time as well as my night nurse Ashley! We had her every night of our stay and because of them two and one other nurse who’s name I didn’t catch... I’m giving at least two stars. I reached out to the head of labor and delivery more than once and have not heard back. My son is now 5 months old haha so I repeat never returning to Marian. Save yourself the trouble and drive to Santa Barbara or San Luis ladies.</text>

<Review>I've had multiple visits to loved ones (maternity, telemetry, CCU, ICU) at this hospital as I grew up in Santa Maria and it's the only game in town. The facility has undergone a major renovation and looks absolutely beautiful, they have a decent cafeteria, family waiting rooms are comfortable, all equipment is new and cutting edge. The staff and volunteers are overwhelming kind and professional though there are a few bad seeds and your experience will likely vary depending on who takes care of you during your stay. The best advice I can give you is to keep on top of your loved ones medications, needs, and plans for discharge/transfer. This is the most challenging part of being in a hospital and while they are supposed to coordinate all the different care being provided on your behalf I found a daily need to advocate for my loved one. Don't assume it is being taken care of, ask lots of questions and make sure you are getting the best care possible.<//Review>< pics>

Housekeepers at the E.R do a horrible job on cleaning. Floors are very sticky it's obviously that no one is mopping the floors. It's just gross one star thanks to the cleaning crew 😒..but the service here is great doct. N nurses are awesome. 👏😊👨‍⚕️👩‍⚕️ I'd give only them a 5 star.<//review>

This place needs to take a tour of Stanford Hospital. Efficiency, customer care and treatment is not a priority at Marian Hospital. I guess since you are the only hospital in town allows you to provide the minimal amount of care to your patients. I have been sitting here for over 2 hours with someone battling cancer and nobody is even checking in. The single star rating is for the lobby chairs. I would be embarrassed if this was where I worked.</Review>

I received a survey for a time I was never seen by a doctor, lab, etc. When I tried calling to get it sorted out, no one answered then when I finally got Deanna Buelow on the phone, she said they would look into it. Now it's been over 6 months without any contact even though I've tried multiple times.... very unprofessional!<//Review>

<Text>I could not be happier with my care yesterday for an outpatient surgical procedure for a cardiac ablation. The ablation team, Dr. Brett Gidney cardiologist, Dr. Chan, anesthesiologist, Dana, RN, and Edwin, were outstanding. Jennifer RN in Pre-op and Delores Rn is recovery were exceptional. Each went out of their way to put into practice Human Kindness. Well done.</Text>< Resp>

<review>Marian charged my daughter $400 for a TB test for college. I called to ask why so high and see if there was anything they could, even a cash discount or anything. I was told a supervisor would return my call in 24-48 hours. A week later, still NO call. I called them and went back through the verification of who I am process, finally got a Supervisor after a long hold and was finally told "there is NOTHING we can do for you. You can make payments though". $400 for a TB test, come on...<//review>< Resp>

This is my home town, and I am almost 80 years old now. My experiences at Marian stretch back to childhood tonsillectomy and other ills of youth through a hysterectomy/appendectomy, and a triple coronary bypass. My mother in her last years was hospitalized for blood clots in her lungs twice. In all cases we were cared for perfectly and with concern for our general well-being. I can't, in all good conscience. give Marian Hospital, in all its incarnations, less than five stars.</review>

Has made recent strides forward toward from just Okay to Very Good and moving toward excellence for a regional facility. Of course, it lacks the specialists that UCLA or Stanford would be expected to have. But it has some very excellent people, and they are a caring staff, in my experience.</Text>

I sat in the billing office for 40 min waiting to be helped. Apparently their billing system was down. They knew why I was there since you need to sign in and circle the reason. There were staff members walking around behind the glass and sitting at their desks, not helping anyone, conversating etc. Not once did anyone come and say, "I'm sorry our billing system is down, would you like to wait, or would you like to return at another time?" I could've easily sat there for over an hour, and no one would have said anything. Very unprofessional. Very low customer service, and courtesy. The only reason I knew their system was down was because as I was leaving, I heard them say, "Our system is now back up and running." And the much more courteous staff member at the front desk let me know as well, as I was exiting the hospital, as she apologized for my experience. This is not my first experience in this same department with the same type of issue/treatment/lack of courtesy/ease of taking their time.<//Review>

My daughter has been having cotractions every 2-5 minutes for 48 hrs. She was at 1.5 cm two days ago. She's at 2cm today with contractions but yet, they sent her home 3 times in 48 hrs. Even after her mucus plug out yesterday, they will not induce labor due to their polices. What purpose? All my kids were born in Fresno, and never have I seen this! Her suffering is heart breaking. Avoid by all means.<//Text>

Excellent care!!!   From the E.R. to the 4th floor, every single person that attended us, treated us with dignity and respect.  We were never ignored or spoken illy to.  From R.N. Michael in the E.R., to Dr. Herrick, Dr.Reid, R.N.'s Katherine and Elda on the 4th floor, they all made sure my daughter was comfortable throughout her surgery.  I was even able to stay with her at the hospital throughout everything (Mon-Fri). Thank you Marian Hospital for providing the best health care ever!!😀</Text>

If you're not dying the doctor will lecture you about how you're wasting their precious time. Marian ER has a long standing reputation for pot service. If you can, your batter off following their advice and see your primary care physician. Also, watch out for Dr. DeMacio<//Review>

Nurses were friendly. But i arrived with a foot broken in three places.  I was given a splint and told to follow up with a podiatrist which will take two weeks. A hospital that cant even do Casts? Hmm.</review>

<text>I am trying to register my son for an EKG. We had signed in at the registration desk at 305 pm with 2 employees working and 2 people waiting ahead of us. 30 minutes later,  I am still waiting to register.

Very cozy and nice place to meet and have a drink. My wife and daughter meet up with my best friend since before high school ended up there and had a great time. We will do it again.<//review>

Authentic Third Generation family bar, great cocktails, good whiskey selection,   Oldest bar in Petaluma, but you'd never know from the clean, well maintained interior.</text>

I went there on Saint Patrick's Day with some friends. I had my first White Russian there, and the old lady behind the bar was an awesome bartender. The decor of the place is very old-timey. Lots of animal heads mounted on the walls, vintage firearms and bayonets and old WWI propaganda recruiting posters and old signs. Overall cozy place, but very small little nook in the street.</Review>

<review>Andresen's Bar is a old western bar that's been around forever.
You'll find the old time Petaluma locals at Andresen's when all the other clubs in town are packed with out of town people on weekend nights
It's a small place and can get crowded at times but if your looking for old time Petaluma this is the place.<//review><userid>104458400379332950656< /userid><Time>1508522587535</Time><pictures>None<//pictures>< GmapID>

Good burrito, similar style to chipotle/ 'mission style' but honestly a little better! I like the cilantro rice. Very fresh ingredients, this is one of my go-to meals in the area.< /text>

<Review>Cilantro - Stopped by this place randomly and was not disappointed! I ordered the vegetarian burrito which is vegan and it tastes better than chipotle. I love their red hot sauce it delish! Staff was very friendly, 5 Stars!</Review>< Pics>

First time here and there was no line! I got a chicken burrito bowl with guacamole and they gave me chips and I got a fountain drink. Great spot, food is awesome!</text>

<rate>1<//rate><text>There were only three customers in the store but an arrogant airline employee dominated the clerk for 30 minutes. So I had to wait quite a long time to get the food that eventually made me sick as a dog.

The chicken tasted as though it was anything but fresh and the three employees didn't seem to care that to customers had to wait so long to order what appears to be rancid and poisoned food.

But that is just my opinion.< /text>< pics>

<Review>Cilantro is a lunchtime staple in my area. When people ask me what it is, I call it a "Bootleg Chipotle", but it's really much better than that. I've been coming here for years, and I've never been disappointed. They have a much larger selection of fillings than Chipotle and in my opinion, has its own unique, distinct flavor. My only gripe is the Carnitas, which can use a more.conventional recipe, but other than that, it's great. Would definitely recommend!<//Review><userid>111783810282488208731</userid>< Gmap_id>

This place is my favorite spot for lunch when I'm at work. The meat is BOMB they cook it right in front of you. It's fast and the staffs are all super nice. Been coming here for over a year and Ive never had a bad experience. I recommend everyone to try this place. FYI the marinated chicken is off the chain!</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><UserId.>115234630155606935349< /UserId.><Review>It was just the ingredients I wanted. The salsa was yummy. You get to pick. It's all laid out for you. It would be nice to have the ambience a little more Mexican and some music, and for the staff to engage a little more. They were focused on themselves, and the work, and didn't seem to care about your enjoyment. The service, as it would be in a sit down, was clearly lacking. Also, how can I keep my burrito hot all the way through? I'll go back for more anyway. Oh, and only $10.50 with a drink.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I received an offer for a free dish at this restaurant. Mexican food is my favorite, as I love El Pollo Loco since they use such freshly and wonderfully made Chicken, which is better for us. I think I will have an awesome time.< /Text>

The burrito was good but cost $14.50 just for the burrito without any drink, That’s insane. Plus they only have one restroom that’s for employees only, why not let the customer use it since it’s in the common area of the restaurant.< /Review>

4 stars the Chicken bowI. 1 star for the RIP OFF HELP! LOVE the Chicken Bowl w Cilantro sauce and green rice .  However the assistant front cashier charged EVERYONE 12.99 NO MATTER WHAT!!! Even tho' the sign CLEARLY says 8.99 special. Its FALSE ADVERTISING. They NEVER mention every item is an extra 1.99. I introduced new people to this place based on promotion and one was a  tourist. That cashier CREEP charged EVERYONE 13.00 even tho' they didn't tell them about the extra fee!! Great way to lose your following
Get rid of these greedy food service nerds
Dont they know 50.00 x 9.99 is better than 2 customers at the RIP off charge.  Please  CHIPOTLE charges 9.00 w EVERY THING.< /Text>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>Really delicious food! Can't deny the food is great here... but if any staff member ever mistreats and kicks out an ACTUAL customer that literally just bought the restaurant's food and it's SOLEY based on that customer's physical appearance again, I hope I won't be present.
I'm a nobody and even if I stop coming it's just one less customer out of maybe hundreds BUT I'm good at embarrassing others and calling them out when they do wrong to others.
To anyone reading this review, I want to point out that this male staff member was not only is it disrespectful because he is judging someone on their looks that maybe don't look as neat as others, but his actions was also unreasonable because this customer was literally SITTING and being to themselves wearing well-kept clothes, had normal materials, CLEAN NEW shoes, and actual GOOD hygiene. There was no good reason to kick them out. This customer was literally waiting for someone to pick them up. It was cold outside and they were just hungry. They weren't being disrespectful, noisy, or disruptful.< /Review>< Name>

I just found out about this place. It's the same concept as chipotle except it's better. The steak taste better and the toppings are good. I just hope they have more options on salsa.< /text>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>Generally it seems like a good choice with healthy food and I really want to like this place but there's a few things that are really poor practices.  When they make their sauce they don't bother discarding the stems off of the peppers.  They just chop them up and toss 'em in.  Today I had part of an avocado stem in my food and when I showed it to the people working there, they really didn't care all that much.

The main two people working here during lunch hours are not happy to be there and  barely recognize you when you order.  I think it would be painful for those folks to crack a smile.<//Review>< pictures>

The prices are regular, they have parking. You can find burritos, tacos, quesadillas, toasts and salads. They have an inn in the establishment.

Honestly, I wish I could give this place  3 stars but I just wasn't really impressed. Perhaps it was because my expectations were SKY high that I didn't find this overwhelmingly awesome. But I really wanted to, I promise!!<//Text>

Went at 11:30 pm and still had to wait an hour for it but it was totally worth it! It's two dollars for cob or bowl and you can get either to go. If you don't want to wait I would recommend going around 1 but even then the line was still long. Also would recommend getting it on the cob; it's more fun to eat and less salty; the bowl had corn water in it and made it too cream. But either was still bomb af!< /review>

I come here for work lunches all of the time. I really enjoy the rotation of food trucks, always something new and different to find here. Try to get there early since it gets packed / has longer lines around lunchtime!< /Text>

A bit pricey for food carts but a very good selection of fusion - whether that's a Korean taco, or good Indian food. Always appreciate the ability to escape the restaurant atmosphere to grab something here. However, note that the lines are quite long during lunch hours - usually at least 10 people ahead of you. They do their best to get the food to you quickly, though. Also, there's a website where you can see which food carts are there, and their hours.<//Text>

There are usually three trucks parked in the alley so you can most likely find something you like. Also, the seating in the back is a nice bonus.< /Text>< pictures>

Food is usually pretty tasty here. Most of time there are at least 2 trucks here, so you’ll almost always be able to find something you love here.

The only downside is sometimes it gets super crowded. The worst one I experienced was when the wait time was so long that my colleagues had already finished their lunch in the park and headed back when my order was ready 😂<//text>

Nice to walk to. Can be crowded and they don't update their Twitter frequently with what trucks are available so it's a guessing game. Between 1-3 trucks usually</text>

Yay for the Truck Stop! It's close by to work so I can always drop by during lunch. The only downside is that there is only room for three trucks in the little alley and the lunch rush can garner long lines. The Truck Stops has rotating trucks and it's convenient as they post a schedule on their site. I'm a fan of The Chairman and the Little Green Cylco. Their foods never fail to disappoint and always taste fresh and delicious.  Also, it's in a nice little location as you can buy your lunch from the trucks and eat in the areas of seats and tables nearby.</Review>

<Text>Usually a good selection of food here, but often only for 90 minutes or so, then things sell out or the trucks leave. Get here by 13:30 if you want anything.

The line for each truck is long, usually running to the side of the next food truck along.< /Text>< pics>

They are actually made without any eggs, are a spinach base, and are friggin delicious! The brussel sprouts are good especially with the sauce. I usually get the idea green tea with the meal as well and it compliments the veggie dish and the brussel sprouts quite well. They offer free WiFi and take out but the meal is so large I would recommend having a seat and staying a while if you can.

The service is amazing, after two trips Sergei (I hope I'm spelling that right) not only learned my name but knew my exact order exactly how I liked it. And it's not just me, I see him treat the other guests with the same level of courtesy and respect. Great service and food.

This little Ramen shop has become a bit of my happy place since moving to LA so my review might be a little biased. Nonetheless you should try it and see for yourself!< /text><Date>1568615156860< /Date><gmapID>0x80c2b94f606214c1:0x3f8326b461d668ce</gmapID>< UserId.>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Like Osteria La Buca down the street, Shyo is a neighborhood restaurant worth traveling to. One of our friends wants it every time they come by.

The chef spent years crafting the broth here and it speaks for itself. The garlic broth is my favorite, and he makes a really good vegetarian broth too :) I love that I can call and ask for any adjustments whether it's spice or substitutions. Nothing beats that local and personal touch.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Right on! Broth was hot. Egg cooked perfectly. Super fair price. As a Japanese person who normally sticks to eating at Japanese run restaurants, this is a place to remember. Fast and friendly staff. The Black Garlic broth was delicious. Wasn’t overpowering as “intense” would suggest. Honestly didn’t expect it to be this good.

< Review>
I ordered the Dar Ramen and it was killer! The portions are huge and there was a large slice of pork belly and a soft boiled egg under the sprouts. I paid $10 and got a meal that I could’ve split woth someone!

I will say the noodles lacked a bit of salt but were still full of flavor. They would’ve been so much better with just a bit more salt.

Service was great! Very kind and quick employees!<//Review>

Worth double what they charge

I decided to amend this review. This is the restaurant which I am evangelizing. This restaurant deserves to succeed.  This food deserves to be eaten. It is immaculately prepared ramen paired with perfecly fun and simple sides. Cheap and delicious options like curry fries, crispy rice, and shishito peppers. You can't go wrong.</Review><username>Sam Richard</username><Gmap_id>0x80c2b94f606214c1:0x3f8326b461d668ce<//Gmap_id><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp>< user_id>

BETTER THAN SILVER LAKE RAMEN!!!
Great service, great noodles, great price.
Friendly waiter was fast to help explain the menu to me and offer recommendations,l. once ordered it took less than five minutes for the bowl to land in front of  me! The aroma made my mouth water and my first spoonful of broth was like a big burst of flavor! Generous portions of perfectly marinated pork belly and a soft-boiled egg decorated the noodles beautifully and were incredibly delicious.
I live a hop skip and a jump away from this place and am so happy I finally got the time to try it. In the three years I’ve lived in Los Angeles I’ve seen so many promising places move in and out of my little strip of Melrose but I am hoping this one is here to stay, I can’t wait to try their vegetation options. I definitely recommend this to anyone in the area looking for a quick place to grab lunch, or any noodle lovers in need of a new favorite! (I’m impatient and ate too quickly so I forgot to take a photo but you’ll just have to believe me about how beautiful the bowl of ramen was. 😂)< /review>

<Text>Wow, where to start with this place, they make their own broth and sauces, they have a very comprehensive menu when you first walk in, the owner is amazing and super friendly, and the food, oh the food, its soooo good, literally everything, if you havent tried this place you are missing out on one of the best ramen spots in Los Angeles< /Text><resp>None< /resp><name>Sean Bourgeois< /name>< Time>

Small local which i hope will progress and open more places throughout CA. Drove 2 hrs because of the reviews, NO REGRETS ! Very friendly and kind staff. They provided excellent warming customer service. Ingredients are fresh, non msg. I recommend the brussel sprouts, i wanted the recipe myself. For any hispanic around, try the birriamen you will not regret it !<//text>

Fire tonkatsu was just. Great! From the first sip of the broth. To the first taste of the noodle. Then to the meat and everything else (threw in some gyoza!) in between. From beginning to end, I loved every bite! 😃 My only regret was having to have to eat so fast, out of worry for my car being towed away. 😑 Filling, fulfilling, and all around tasty. Fill this place's chairs up! You won't regret it.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The best ramen I've had !! The garlic ramen spectacular tasty, the amounts of each bowl could be for two people. The day before I tried the Tuna Bowl, the tuna and rice mix was very good. We have also tried the potatoes with curry, the curry they make has a special flavor. The unbeatable quality-price. If you are in Los Angeles, do not hesitate to visit them.

Excellent staff. Manager regularly touched our table. Judy was fabulous! Food was great. Wife had Camerones al Portal and I the burrito with ground beef. Loved it! Easy, fun and a local favorite.</review>

This gem in the desert is all about great service and amazing food.  The barbacoa is by far one of the best I've had in any restaurant around here, the Cadillac Margaritas are extremely tasty and totally customizable, and you have to try the skinny margaritas they are legit.  Pretty much every aspect of the food is on point and their tortillas are fresh made in house the waitresses there are so nice and so accommodating big and small groups all get treated well.  By far one of my favorite places to eat ever.</text>

The real winner though is their homemade flan.  Flipping FANTASTIC!  Food was good but a little cool.  We did not get our exact order. I suspect it was just an off day.  My daughter preferred it to other restaurants in the area.  I do recommend this place but do speak up if your order is not right. We did not which could have changed the whole experience. The margarita was perfect.<//review>< Resp>

Great service. Food was delicious. Drinks were great too. It feels like your in a restaurant from Mexico. Cool ceramics cups for the drinks. Michelada we ordered was super cold and good. The food was really good and they seem to have a variety of food to choose from, from meat lovers to seafood lovers.<//review>

<review>Was recommended by friends, we called to have a table ready before getting there. We arrived and everything was set up and were given 5 star service. The girls waiting on us were so sweet and offered so much information on food items we asked about. The stuffed yellow peppers with shrimp were awesome, the cucumber margarita was delicious and all our meals were top notch.  Would definitely return!!! Thank you so much for a wonderful evening!!!<//review><Time>1549775841180<//Time>< Pics>

While getting groceries at a store we asked the cashier if she could recommend authentic Mexican food. She said that she worked at one and said to come and try. Well we did and she wasn't lying it was amazing.  Everything we ordered had great flavors. I definitely recommend.< /text>

The food is exceptional and the service is even better.  The baked chorizo and cheese appetizer may be one of the greatest dishes on the planet.  Every dish we ordered came out piping hot and was presented beautifully.  The price was excellent for our party of 8. We would recommend El Portal any day.  Thank you for the hospitality and great meal. We will return.</review>

Discovered this restaurant. Nice place to eat. The food was delicious, the staff friendly. They apologized for the temperature inside as the a/c had shut down due to a power failure earlier. Overall, it was a nice place to eat.< /Review>

You are not going to believe that this food is as good as I say until you try it for your self. I get carnitas plate and you would think there was grandma hiding in the back room making it, the best I’ve had anywhere.</review>

My first time and I was totally impressed...! The space is big, but the parking lot is small.

The food is great..! Nice big chili in the relleno, great tamales - just like homemade. Beans and rice are.. well, beans and rice.

Great food..! And most dinners are between 10 and 15 bucks. Great value...!</text>< name>

Very good Mexican food with comfortable surroundings and attentive service. Affordable with a pretty comprehensive menu. The parking, however, is awful. And if you want spicy, ask for the hot salsa. And a fire extinguisher.<//Text>

<text>Love my menudo, and it better be good. No one, no one has ever earned a 10 as best. 8 1/2 is tops except mi familia, 9.  The challenge is always for someone, someplace to best 9.
Here 7. In my book that is a number of pride.

There was a misunderstanding with my order which caused it to come out about 5 min after everyone else's.  The staff were very apologetic and even discounted our meal without me even suggesting. Everyone there was very eager to please and the food was delicious!!</Text>

< review>
For me, this restaurant did not live up to the Google Rating some others have given it. Let's start with its physical presence: It is located in a minor strip mall, it has inadequate parking, it has generic interior appointments, and is quite small. Next, the food: The Enchiladas del Chili Colorado used shredded beef instead of chunks, had no Colorado Sauce inside, very little outside, and were served in quite skimpy portions. Also, the rice (plain and uninspiring) came five minutes after the meal was served. (How could a Mexican Restaurant run out of rice in the middle of the afternoon?) Next, the service: Over the course of our meal, we were served by three different waitresses, none of whom knew what the others had done. The waitress who took our order had an almost incomprehensible Spanish accent. And we had to ask three times to get our check delivered. Next, the drinks: My two Arnold Palmers had inconsistent portions of tea & lemonade and my companion said his Margarita had very little actual tequila in it. Finally, the cost: The food and service were mediocre but the prices were high -- out of line for what we got. I will not return to this restaurant and I recommend others avoid it, as well.<//review>

I have friends and family that go here often and like this place that's why they're getting two stars not one. I have been at El Portal a total of four times. First time the food was okay and I forget what I ordered. Second time several of us ordered the same dish and the portions were so small I just couldn't believe it. It almost seem they were out of the dish we ordered and split one serving between three of us. Third time I went with friends and family and that's the only reason I went back. I thought I would order the same dish I ordered on my last visit (pork ribs with nopales). Same thing, three very small pork riblets, you could have pick each one up inside a spoon, with very little nopales. The fourth and maybe my last time, I ordered two tacos a la carte. My tacos were okay but sorry to say all I heard from the rest of the party was how bland the food was. Some ordered dishes they ordered before and were delicious then but failed this time around. No consistancy with the food preparation and if they're out of a certain dish they should let you know instead of serving you a very small portion.<//Review>

<Text>Been going here for several years, and always great!!
Last night however was a totally different experience. Took a friend,(of course when you take someone new), and ordered our dinners, there were 3 of us. Dinners were served, but never got our tortillias, asked for them 3 different times. Then finally 2 different people brought them to the table, only to find our dinners already eaten, they both took them back to the kitchen. One wait person offered one person only,(in the party of 3), flan as an apology, not all of the party of which none of the three got their complete dinner. less that a positive experience.

< Review>
This place is sensational! We were greeted very warmly and seated right away. Decent pricing to start off with. Our waitress was nice and accommodating. My friend had never tried horchata before, and theirs was phenomenal. They brought out chips and salsa, and it was excellent, both very fresh and pleasing. I had a burrito enchilada style with green sauce. It was very succulent and moist, and stuffed just right. My friend had the carne asada, which was awesome too (I tried a bite!). His came with a side of refried beans and some tortillas that were obviously homemade. The best part was everything was not smothered in cheese. A lot of Mexican restaurants compensate their bland offerings by loading on the cheese and sauces. This place does not. We will definitely be back here. In a sea of so-so Mexican food, this place rises above.</Review>

Worst service ever! We were the fourth people into the restaurant and never got our food after an hour of waiting. People after us ate and left and still we didn't have food. Finally just left after the second waitresses asked if we needed anything else. OMG! We never even got food. Worst place EVER!< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very good attention from the waitresses, I asked for a meatloaf soup I had never tried and if it was very tasty, the gruecesitas handmade corn tortillas and the fresh tamarind in a clay cup were delicious.

(Translated by Google) I went to breakfast today and they only had two tables to attend to, but I don't know what was going on with the lady, I looked at me twice that she was waiting but I didn't say hello and when I went inside it took a long time and it's not that I'm impatient, it lasts 15 minutes and nothing.

(Original)
Fui hoy a desayunar y so solo tenian dos mesas que atender pero no se que tava pasando con la señorita me miro dos veces que tava esperando pero no saludo y cuando entraba adentro se tardava mucho y no es que sea impaciente dure 15 minutos y nada<//text>

This place is awesome! $10 for 2 hours of free play. The owners pride themselves, and should, on the wholesome environment they have created. This is our go to for burning kid energy.< /Review>

There is four jumpers and a few arcade games. Definitely enough stuff for young children to do without getting bored. The staff was really nice<//Text>

What a fun morning! We met up with some friends and or kids bounced for a couple hours. Relaxed causal atmosphere. Easy to find right off the freeway. A nice way to spend a Sunday!< /text>

It was a decent place with a lot of bouncy fun. Only problem was they don't have air conditioning and it's in a warehouse. It must have been close to 100 degrees in that place the day we went. The swamp coolers they brought out just couldn't make a dent in that heat, and even opening the doors didn't help.

Nice spot but won't be back, at least not during the summer.</Review>

<Text>A cute little place with friendly staff, who keep things clean and tidy. Awesome custom coffee drinks served at the little food counter by the friendly staff..... the negative part is it is a bit out of the way and they have fewer operating hours, compared to similar places.</Text><username>leah neal</username><rating>3< /rating>< user>

Grass is green there's senior citizen gatherings Filipino most of them but they all are wonderful and have much to teach say and dance. No gang activity plenty of parking. Good for jogging baseball picnicking. Plenty space for tents canopies. The interstate 125 skip and jump. Stores close by ATMs gas stations. Dogs are allowed. Clean park. Wheel chair ramps to rest room area. Clean rest room I've only seen the Men's  facility. I assume the Ladies facility is also clean. Nice Park check it out if your in the area.</Review>

This park is a good park. Nice big field.
But it definitely needs to be cleaned. It has been very dirty lately. The playground is super nasty.</review>

Mrs. Maggie is the rudest person there. She yelled across the room at my kid without realizing I was there. Even though she's hispanic she's very rude to the hispanic community. That lady needs to go ASAP. Once she barged in the exercise room yelling how she knew who was taking extra stuff I found that very weird but dismissed it because she seems to be a grouch. Second she refused to give a lunch to an elderly woman claiming it was for kids Only and a nice guy told the lady to take it there's plenty of left overs all the time.< /text>

Plenty of stores having all sorts of stuff, nice people greeting you willing to negotiate with you,  live music and different food places, parking alright,  they give you the VIP option, don't know how much they charge. Very nice experience,  planning to visit it soon again.< /Review>

Place was really dirty from the swap meet early in the day. Not sure if this is normal but the parking lot was full trash! I'm addition they started the movie before it was fully dark making the film hard to see at the begining.</review>

(Translated by Google) I like this swapmet and there is a lot of variety although right now there are not many people selling because of the pandemic but if it is a good place to buy and a good price, we hope that this pandemic will pass soon and we will return to how we were before, God first

<Text>(Translated by Google) EVERYTHING IS WELL CHINGON
BUT I BELIEVE YOU WILL EXAVE WITH THE PRICE OF BEER, IT IS TOO MUCH
$ 18dls, X a 32 oz beer. - & NO AND PLACE BETTER TO GO DANCING, AND GO A GOOD CHINGON RATE.
ANOTHER OF THINGS IS THAT WHEN A GOOD BAND IS PRESENTED, THEN THEN, PEOPLE STACK UP THERE
TO TAKE VIDEO TO THE GROUPING ... FOR THAT THAT IS ALREADY A PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE, THE VIDEOS CAN DOWNLOAD, OR LOOK ON YOU2 .. THE LITTLE SPACE KE AY IS TO DANCE, NOM WHAT THE RACE, DOESN'T MISS IT, ARE. LIKE THE
BORREGOS, NOMAS LOOK
THE FIRST WHAT IS ARIMED
WITH HIS CELLULITIVE PIG HERE THROUGHOUT THE BALL, FOR KE THAT.
THE HONDA WILL MAKE THE LITTLE SPACE KE AY, IT IS FOR DANCING, DON'T DANCE OR LET THEY DANCE, THEY DO NOT STACK AS
TICKETS, IN THE EARS OF THE COW ...

(Original)
TODO ESTA BIEN CHINGÓN
PERO CREO QUE EXAJERAN CON EL PRECIO DE LA CERVEZA, ES DEMACIADO
$18dls, X una cerveza de 32 Oz. -& NO AY LUGAR MEJOR PARA IR A BAILAR , Y PASAR UN BUEN RATO CHINGÓN.
OTRA DE LAS COSAS ES QUE CUANDO SE PRESENTA UNA BUENA BANDA , LUEGO LUEGO, LA GENTE SE AMONTONA AHI ENFRENTÉ
PARA TOMAR VIDEO ALA AGRUPACIÓN... PARA KE ESO SÍ YA AY GENTE PROFESIONAL, LOS VIDEOS LOS PUEDEN BAJAR, O MIRAR EN YOU2.. EL POCO ESPACIO KE AY ES PARA BAILAR, NOMÁS QUÉ LA RAZA,NO LA MALICIA, SON. COMO LOS
BORREGOS, NOMAS  MIRAN
AL PRIMERO QUÉ SE ARIMA
CON SU COCHINO CELULITIVO AHÍ BA TODA LA BOLA, PARA KE ESO.
HAGARREN LA  HONDA EL POCO ESPACIO KE AY , ES PARA BAILAR,  NO BAILAN NI DEJAN BAILAR, NOMÁS SE  AMONTONAN COMO
GARRAPATAS, EN LAS OREJAS DE LA VACA...</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) The place is good but the sellers do not like to bargain they do not give guarantees they want to sell new questions for the things they give you a price they look at you then they change the price that is not the other and others that want to sell and do not want to reduce $ 10 dlls that's bad for them and that's why you do not sell the products for greedy

(Original)
El lugar esta bueno pero los vendedores no les gusta regatear no dan garantias quieren vender cono nuevo preguntas por las cosas te dan un precio te miran luego luego cambian los precio que ese no es el el otro y otros qye quieren vender y no quieren ni  rebajarte $10 dlls eso abla mal de ellos y por eso no seles vende los productos por avariciosos<//Text>
