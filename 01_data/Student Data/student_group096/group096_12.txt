I have insurance that is somewhat limited.  The staff helped guide me where it was comfortable and affordable for me. I even picked out a Michael Kors frame. I'm happy about coming in after 3 years. I would recommend.< /text>

I just want to say probably one of the most impressive optometrist I've been to. Staff is friendly and very helpful when you have questions they have a great honest answer for you. I want to thank Nicole and Gio for helping me on my new frames and being so friendly. Clean and professional places like this don't get enough recognition so I just want to thank the whole staff here at Eye Care Optometry. 😊</Review>

Pleasant walk-in ordering experience as used my own frames needing lenses changed to new prescription.  The order was ready in two weeks and  their lab had no problems with inserting the lenses considering you have to sign a waiver for any damage.  The cost was nearly the same that I paid for my glasses using insurance--since this last order was not covered with insurance, I had to pay full price with saving on the frames.  To be honest did not see much of a cost difference with my original glasses, other than for the frames, covered by insurance. Lenses are working great with my old frames that I prefer to the new frames I purchased in my original order from Eye Care Optometry Associates.</text>

Update: I’m changing my review. My experience in the beginning was great. The experience I had when my glasses arrived was horrible! I get a phone call at 5:30 and spoke to a woman on the phone who said my glasses were ready. I arrived shortly after 6 PM and there was a girl sitting inside. I knocked on the door and she ignored me. I knocked a few more times and then she turned to me and rudely yelled we are closed. The lack of customer service after I had spent the money on the glasses was upsetting. Had I known this would be the outcome I would used services elsewhere. It’s unfortunate because I only get one visit a year from my insurance. Next year I will be using a different office for my eye care needs.< /review><Rate>3< /Rate></record>

I made online appointment and registration as a new patient (completed).  I called their office this morning and spoke to one of their staff, she said, she can't find me on their data system and the registration number can't guarantee that I successfully completed. Therefore,  it pointless and can not guarantee my essential information will be protected from their website.<//Text>

Coco, take some advice and learn how to respect patients concerns and have some class.  Stop acting like you are something special, you are arrogant and inconsiderate about others, you lack professionalism which is extremely important considering whoever made you manager. Maybe it’s time you find a job you like or your job might ask you to leave due to many complaints. Take those fake contacts off, and we all know ur not a natural blonde and grow up- you aren’t working for hello kitty honey.<//text>

I have mixed feelings about coming here. I been using them for several years now and the doctor's are really professional, i can't complaint about them. However, the customer service can use a little help. When i got my pair of glasses i didn't have an issue. However, when we went for my husband's appointments we didn't get the same service. I mean we spent $600 on two pair of glasses. So when i have questions about the pricing i expect you to have some patience and not act like im waisting your time. It's our hard earned money that we are spending and it feels like we are talking about a $2.00 purchase. We like the selection but, im not sure if I'll be coming back to this particular location.<//text>

<review>I have been going to lens crafter for years and do to the pandemic I decided to look around for a new place to get my glasses and I saw this place while walking around plaza next to any Jollibee.
I called this place and made an appointment, I showed up to this place and this lady I think she is the manager name Coco think she’s all that, she is not pleasant I don’t know if she likes her job. I still went on with the pre screening and waited till the eye doctor called me she is very pleasant, then I chose the glasses that I wanted, they offered me all this options for my glasses but all I wanted is just what I needed so I bought into their sales and paid extra for my glasses out of my pocket. I waited 2weeks for my glasses to arrive (lens crafter only takes an hour if they have the lens and a day or two if they don’t have the lens) after a week of using the glasses that I got from this place it’s been giving me headaches and it slowed me down on my work. I took it back yesterday and told them that I just need a single vision the doctor is fine with it, but the manager seem upset as to why I need to return it. I have ask her if she will refund me the extra payment I paid since the suggestion and advise the made didn’t work for me, she said it is not in their policy to do a refund and if I change my lens to single vision whatever extra payment I paid is forfeited and cannot be refunded. So pretty much i paid for a Lexus when they gave me Kia.
They still have my glasses till now and I don’t know when will I get a call that it’s ready for puck up. I will call my insurance and tell my insurance that this place is over charging them.<//review><time>1596991593961</time>< pictures>

I cannot stress this more - if you only need reading glasses, just go to Costco. This place is a total rip off. Paying $360 a year for Vision insurance, you only get one eye exam, will charge you for a copay of $10, and if you don’t need a new reading glass, you can take sunglasses instead. However, their sunglasses are overpriced. When i didn’t find any that i like i was told to look online like sunglasshut.comband they will get it for me. So i did, found a Ray Ban costing $190 online. I went back to them and requesting to order it for me. They were charging me $260 for the exact model. I asked them why, they replied that’s the price they have to charge. $70 more! I would understand if they charge $10 or even $20 more but $70? No way. They were underestimating their client’s intelligence. Do the math, if i have to pay $360 a year for insurance and don’t need a new reading glasses, i might as well go to Costco, $35 for eye exam, get a new reading glasses which Costco has an excellent return policy, and buy new sunglasses online with free delivery too. No stars for this practice! Don’t be scammed.<//text>

<review>My family and I have been coming to this company for more than 20 years. I have seen it move a couple times around the same area which is awesome. The people don’t change either, meaning they have great customer service. They listen, know what they are doing and don’t try to upsale you. I extremely appreciate the fact that they ALL have a positive attitude. Thank you!

Update:
At another visit I can say the same thing! They were helpful, patient and welcoming. Thank you please stay the same!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Thank you so much for making this area a wildlife reserve. Without this reserve, the Long-Toed Salamander would be extinct right now.

Went here a few days ago in search of a fender to use as a front grille.
I got the perfect fender for a real good price.
Nice folks.<//review>

This place has History and is Original, they have a little bit of of everything, new and used parts for your Bike, good old mechanics, and plenty of time to get you rolling.
My lady and I visited during the holidays, there was live entertainment and a toy drive for the less fortunate. All in all, respect and the spirit of love was present.👍<//review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Name>Kevin Conley<//Name><review>Seems as they dont want to sell. Went looking for a few items for my bike which they had in sock. But was tryin to talk me out of buying. I left without buying anything. He was a nice guy. Not a motivated seller. Parts I wanted he told me, oh those are expensive. I went to spend money knowing harley parts arent cheap. I guess ill spend my money else where. Would not recommend that place to my friends.</review><UserId.>112243432548810495212<//UserId.><gmapID>0x80dcb1f93de0ea13:0x95d7cd29e8f2967e< /gmapID><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

New barber with ponytail and big body is constantly talking and using his phone when cutting hair. Completely unprofessional and holding up the wait. Even messed up on the guy in front of me hair<//text>

Terribly disappointing. First parking is an issue. You walk in and no greeting whatsoever just a look that you're bothering their time. The wait wasn't long but I had to sit in a dirty chair full of hair with a barber with no mask and refusing to wear one. Then to get a bad haircut and tell me that I don't know what I'm talking about as far as my own head. I tell him to blend it and he said it is Blended it's just your hair. I worked behind the chair as a stylist for 25 years I definitely know the difference being Blended or not he did not fix it and give me attitude about it. I would never recommend this place to anyone.<//Text>

<review>I have been waiting for so long , but when one of their friends enters to the barbershop they are taken care immediately and barbers don’t care  that the others are waiting, I don’t not know if the owner realizes  this is bad for business , people  start leaving and they walk away when they seen some one that  hasn’t been waiting like the others for his turn , is not fair that they just walk in straight to the chair
this is the second time that happens already , very unprofessional<//review><rating>1< /rating>< Resp>

Was my first time there, seemed chill and friendly, the  fades are fresh, my cut came out professionally. The price is average, its a small mom and pop baber shop, would recommend, I am going again. Parking is a pain tho</Review>

Takes too long to get a haircut. It used to be 12 dollars for the haircut and now it's 20. Also the barbers aren't even good.</text>

We love brunch and this was the best brunch we’ve ever had! From the set menu, we did the smoked salmon salad and shrimp as appetizers + hanger steak and halibut as entrees + chocolate cake and coconut baked Alaska as dessert. We also added a half a dozen oysters and two espressos. Absolutely delicious, calm and beautiful ambiance, and excellent service.< /Review>

This was our first trip to Palm Springs and Le Vallauris, and this did not disappoint! We attended their brunch service on Sunday and were seated in the patio. The patio was energetic, fun and very romantic. They offered a set menu with a choice of an app and entree paired with complementary champagne and desert. The appetizers, entree and dessert were all amazing and the services was outstanding. We said it was possibly our favorite brunch we have ever attended. We wish they had a location closer to us as were just visiting. We highly recommend Le Vallauris for Sunday brunch!< /text>

Always an exquisite dining experience for newly 40 years.  Probably the best fine dining experience in the desert.   Amazing seafood and delicious soups.  And I always enjoy their perfectly prepared French 75 cocktail.  If you’re looking for authentic French, fine dining cuisine, this is the place to go!<//review>

Love the cozy outdoor seating. Tables were well spaced out. Waiters were very attentive. Food was the best we had in Palms Springs - Lobster Bisque was DELICIOUS! Escargots was amazing. Duck was cooked so well with crispy skin and moist meat. Great wine list.</review>

<Review>If you are looking for an authentic French restaurant Le Vallauris is THE place to go. First the outdoor seating is perfect, it looks like you are in Provence with the larges trees. Then the team speaks French and is friendly. Finally and the most important the food, I’m French so trust me this is the real French food, delicate, elegant and full of flavors. The « île flottante «  is the same my grandma used to do for me when I was young!
This restaurant is one of my favorites in Palm Springs !</Review><userid>118368759969302089208</userid><time>1614116011662</time><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnsgmUUnIBjIBwMxINswP8GPCVtgMscxkx7MIX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7y8yLvzriVPumEMg3S4ba9SS6vyXC-zgk6Als=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I cannot say how amazing this place is. Roasted tomato avocado soup, escargot, the bread shaped like wheat sheaves, the V stamped butter, amazing steak, lamb, shrimp. Wow! The vichyssoise was to die for! Our service was impeccable by even Michelin standards! Comprehensive wine list! You can order in French if you wish! The owners are charming and the maitre d' is a prince among men. The bartender mad one mean Manhattan and Bloody Mary! I was beyond impressed.<//Review>< resp>

You have a choice of six or eight salads, main courses, and desserts, they keep the champagne flowing. Everything was excellent. Our waitresses was from Paris and had a lovely French accent.

<resp>None< /resp><Review>Spectacular dinner, nice staff, beautiful location with both indoor and outdoor seating.  They have amazing ficus trees on the patio which were planted years ago by the owner.  I was there for a birthday party for a close friend.  We had around 40 people in the private dining room.  I had the salmon and my wife had the filet.  Both were spot on!  The wines were perfectly paired for the dinner.  Overall a great place for dinner in Palm Springs.< /Review><Name>Steven Mindel<//Name><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

<Review>When you go to Le Vallauris, you immediately encounter a very welcoming  and helpful staff.  The service and atmosphere is always superb.  They have an extensive wine list and the food is always fantastic.  A great venue for that “special night” or just a night out on the town.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKxpbjaB1K4YKWD_mOGewMM1qViHk5JkefB8pz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPgOlFe3pxTpClK0urx1wZfo2iAkRuhfp7lqbv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqq3T6HXNMnKjHy05eA8ltV4Pd1nFyP9Q2WaP8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7U2jrnUAKYGpbPxe_O8HmqZCbsbxG5arkJwTc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAfE0_-0jolbP9sj0-lonwlUlOWxuWOle9MbiC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqLn0Kpq6-pPWc_ZTCX8M7g3XUl1LjYpKgoshf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXzMLw8R2DvC3cWzhFF8qgG8PTvfI1XBo-pBDq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>Beautiful setting, decent service and some hits and misses when it comes to the food.

It's obvious why so many rave about the gorgeous setting, especially at night with the outdoor lights. Thai night did not disappoint, except maybe the crowd. It was the 15th of February, so there may have been some carry over from Valentines which typically makes great restaurants ordinary due to the kitchen being overwhelmed. Same goes with service. At times I felt rushed and out of place and other times treated as expected in a high end restaurant. I guess only another visit during a typical dinner service will tell.

As for the food, the Rack of lamb was delish but why call it a rack when it was just chops? The braised beef cheeks were not our fave, but ok. Same for the Red beet salad. We were very disappointed in the Spanish octopus cocktail. It was like a bad version of a typical octopus cocktail at a mariscos restaurant. I only wish i had tapatio to add some extra flavor. The real winner and highlight of the night was the Grand Marnier Soufflé. That did not disappoint, neither did the "show"<//Review>< Pics>

Beautiful, delicious food! We enjoyed the fixed Christmas menu, reminding us of France, with appetizer, main, and dessert.  If you enjoy excellent service with French flair, an extensive wine list, and cozy white linen tablecloth ambiance, this is for you. Worth the price, especially for special occasions. Outside seating is inviting and perfect for the desert. Looking forward to our next visit.</Review>

Great experience for Christmas dinner! They had a Christmas dinner menu that was so good with a nice variety of food. The lobster Ravioli was amazing for the entree! Would highly suggest ordering that! The Pear appeared to be one of the most popular ordered as we saw many going around all night. The pecan pie was the best out of the three we tried. Would go back again for dinner. Thanks for a great night. Wonderful staff too!!!</Review>

We went here due to other peoples recommendations. The ambience was very old school chic. Service was friendly and formal. Food was good.

Overall, we found it pricey for what you received. Enjoyed our time but most likely would not return again.

Enjoyed many other restaurants in Palm Springs more.</Review>

Wonderful venue. Went there for Thanksgiving dinner. Expensive for the quality of the meal. Tuna tartare was below average. Their beef filet with truffel sauce was amazing.<//Text>

<Text>I have been to enough elegant dining restaurants and most have an area or two that elevate them above their competitors.  For some, the food is great but the service is lackluster or the food shines more because the restaurant atmosphere somehow makes one believe it to be true...  However this restaurant is astonishing on every level. The service is unprecedented. The atmosphere and the layout are truly special. And when you combine those 2 elements with the food, you have created le vallauris..  I cannot_in us what a fantastic evening You will have after taking this recommendation. Top 3 restaurants in Palm Desert or Palm Springs.</Text>< pictures>

Had the wonderful experience of Xmas dinner at Le Vallauris. The food was delicious and elegantly presented. I enjoyed a dinner of rack of lamb with smoked duck as my appetizer. Both were exceptional and perfectly prepared.  The service was flawless.
I would love to return and check out the entire menu.</Review>

<Text>Stunning!!! Many places want to be French restaurant but this is it! Good food comes in small portions and costs more. Yet, after leaving this place you will not be hungry but you will want to come back. I went twice, a private dinner and a group gathering of 30+people. In both cases it was perfect. Excellent food and incredible wine list. Considering many California places offer mostly domestic wine these guys go all the way back to France, whatever you desire. Even had a chance to practice my very weak French with most of the personnel. Service, food and wine all 5 Star level.< /Text>< user>

<review>Impeccable restaurant, in all aspects, from reservation, to service, to food.

Tony Bruggemans, the manager, was a pleasure to work with. I had a fairly large group with me, and he was very accommodating and made sure we had the best experience possible. Raymond and all members of the staff (sorry I didn't get all their names to be able to mention each one individually as they deserve) provided the best restaurant service I've had in a long time.

And the food is out of this world. Special mention to the Grand Marnier soufflé for dessert. Impressive and delicious.

I received many compliments for organizing the event, but Tony and the restaurant staff are the ones who deserve all credit.<//review>< Date>

I absolutely adore this restaurant!! Air conditioning, outside, can you believe it?! This place is truly something magical. They have indoor and outdoor seating but we sat outside, in the air conditioning, under the lighted trees. They have a pre fixe menu and a hand written a la carte menu that is brought to your table via white board. Our servers were fabulous and the entire staff were so friendly and attentive. This is a great place to spend a special occasion. I had the poached pear as a starter, lobster for my entree, and panna cotta for dessert; everything was divine. I will definitely be returning.< /Text>

Lunched yesterday and was not surprised.  We wanted a quiet, relaxed meal to begin our new year.  We were not disappointed.  The service is attentive, the menu selections varied and the quality cannot be matched in the valley.  Its not just a place for special events--its a haven for escape from crazy Palm Springs during "the season".<//review>

Very underwhelming experience for Palm Springs Restaurant Week. The menu was a poor value compared to many of the other places I’ve gotten to try this week, and I was pretty shocked at the lack of flavor in the food.

All three courses were bland as can be, unexciting, and lacking any texture - everything was a different form of mush. In all fairness their demographic was very old... we were definitely the only people below 50 in the restaurant, so that probably suits their target market. Most of the food was not remotely French either, which was a pretty big letdown.

Maybe their regular menu is decent, but based on this experience I cannot recommend this establishment. Impeccable service, as our server was pleasant and attentive - but that did not make up for the subpar dining experience.</Text>

Exceptional French fine dining! Expensive but well worth it. The owner walks around the restaurant and will converse in French with you. Sit on the patio set around trees wrapped in strands of white lights. Service is amazingly good - very attentive staff.<//Text>

Wonderful meal, excellent service, great atmosphere. My wife and I went for our anniversary. We sat on the patio and it was a lovely evening, the lights, the vibe, the warm spring evening. Highly recommend.</review>

This is always been a five-star restaurant there's been nothing like the Le Vallauris in Palm for many many years. It's one of The last Resorts that offers a Continental Cuisine fine dining experience.< /review>

<text>First bad experience at restaurant. We tried to order items from dinner menu at lunch. Thought we were ok but not so much.
The miscommunication I can deal with but when the steamed lobster tail came out as a deconstructed chilled salad and I sent back the problem started.

First another waiter came and explained that was how they served lobster at lunch....

Next head waiter came by I explained the issue and he threw his waiter under the bus,   being new and incompetent.

Thinking when you spend $350 w/tip for lunch resolution rather than trashing the help would be a better approach.

I will still go back as this was the first bad experience over a number of good but trashing help rather than resolving issue needs to be addressed.< /text>< Pictures>

I am long time winter resident of the desert I have not been to the restaurant for over a year.  I was very disappointed by the food. I had a lobster bisque which had no lobster and was equivalent to Campbell's tomato soup.
As usual the service was impeccable but I didn't enjoy my meal. Very surprising!< /Text>

It's a beautiful restaurant run by an excellent staff serving delicious food.  The menu is classically French, but some things are classic for a reason.

We've dined here three times and next week will be our fourth.  We love the atmosphere, the service and special attention from the owner who stops by the table for a little chit chat and has done so on every visit.  We never expect him to remember us, and that's okay!  It shows he takes an interest and makes you feel a little special.  The menu is pretty interesting, some innovative and some standards, but always high quality, always delicious. Great for quiet, romantic evenings.<//text>

The host Patrice is a gem and our waiter Olivier truly fantastic. We had a prix fixe in our group which is a wonderful value and quite delicious, fresh full oysters, amazing duck, and out of this world lobster ravioli. Don't miss cocktails, wine or dessert. Do it all. Outstanding all around.< /Review>

The service was great and the location was pretty nice as well. But the food was not worth the price, by far. It was decent but when you spend so much on it it should be fantastic. And it should all be at the proper temperature (not lukewarm sausage and octopus) and look great on the plate as well.<//text>

< Review>
Last night we were taken to Le Vallauris in Palm Springs. From the moment I walked into the restaurant with the piano player playing a favorite song it was a night to remember. We ate outside under the beautiful trees and white bulbs popping through the trees. Our dinner was awesome. I started with Lobster Bisque-to die for and then had the duck cooked to perfection. The others had lobster, a special plate with lots of goodies and the filet. We topped it off with an ice cream toasting and creme brûlée. The service was exceptional and an experience we won’t forget.< /Review>

One year ago next month I had the most enchanting special birthday party for my mother.  We had 32 people on the patio at tables of 8 each.  The food and service were just amazing. I planned it for the Sunday brunch. They have a lovely Sunday brunch every week in season so planning it for that day made my process so smooth.  The price per person was already established and guests got to choose and be served by attentive and kind staff, it's not a buffet.  Everyone loved it and I'm planning a much smaller repeat this year for her.  It's become a family tradition destination; a truly special patio under their lovely and very old trees. Thank you Le Vallauris.</review>

Spent my 1 year anniversary dinner here with the love of my life last night and it was definitely a great decision. I had flowers delivered to the restaurant which were at the table as promised. The maitre d along with the rest of service was excellent and complimented the ambiance of the restaurant perfectly. Although expensive, the food was delicious and an excellent value if you choose one of the previously fixed menus. Definitely recommend.</Text>

I am in love with this place. I love the outdoor dinning area because you are surrounded by lights and beautiful trees.
The service is excellent and the food, my gosh, is incredible.
I save this place for when I'm celebrating or feeling romantic.<//review>

A magical place here in the desert for one of the most pleasurable, fine dining experiences you will ever have. The staff is trained far better than any other restaurant and the food . No words! Just sigh.  The Grand Marnier​ Souffle is unequalled anywhere.</Review>

Excellent country French restaurant in Palm Springs.  Excellent, knowledgeable and attentive wait staff.  We truly enjoyed the 5 course chef's menu, but plan to go back to try some of the a la carte entrees.  $$$ , but not outrageous for the quality of the food and service.  This is going to be one of our stops each trip to Palm Springs. Good variety, esp Bordeauxs, of French wines including 1st and 2nd growths.</text>

<Review>We have enjoyed dinning at Le Vallauris numerous times.  When we decided to get married this was the obvious choice for the venue.  As always the food was absolutely delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  The service was impeccable.  The management, bartenders and wait staff did everything possible to provide the highest level of service - they surpassed our expectations.  The atmosphere is truly stunning.  Due to the food, staff and restaurant, this was a remarkable experience – it could not have been any better.   We look forward to returning often.<//Review>< pictures>

Very disappointed in our treatment by the maitre d'. We called a month ahead and switched a previous reservation to Sat night during Christmas weekend. When we called they said they could only seat us at 5:45 which is earlier than we preferred, but we agreed. When we arrived, they did not have our reservation. We were among the first patrons but they said they had no room to seat us the garden and put us in an empty room that never filled up, nor did the garden. The food was good, service was slow. Owner offered to move us out to the garden after 2 hours but too little, too late. $500 meal for condescending treatment - shame on them .</Text>

I suspected a real foodie might even call it mediocre. I'd probably give it about a 7 out of 10.

The location is great with street parking and the restaurant interior is very cozy and comfy with earthy tones and good light fixtures, very modern. We ordered the sweet soy sauce fried chicken KFC which was really good. We also ordered the bulgogi fried rice and beef burrito k. The bulgogi fried rice was okay but I felt it was soy sauce rice with frozen vegetables and then the beef being added on top and not seasoned too well. The burrito k was good with fries but a little strong with the raw onions. Service was impeccable and attentive and quick.</review><Rate>3<//Rate><GmapID>0x80db1baf83485a69:0x3d96a368d844e9da</GmapID><user>117619389516422928086<//user></record></dataset><record>

Our 7:45 pm reservation turned into an 8:15 seating at the table next to the servers' door to the kitchen.  But staff & the maitre de made up for it with solid attention to our meal &
requests & a closing glass of champagne.  A classy, high cuisine restaurant it continues to be.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Excellent food and well worth it! My husband and I came here last night and this place has the most enchanting atmosphere! Service was very good as well but I give it a 4 star though since we had several people come and ask how everything was but not one of them looked at me and asked. I found it to be rude even though it didn't seem intentional but everyone should be recognized at the table, not just the men and since I am the one who also will decide if we will go again.</Review>

<text>I'm still scratching my head and trying to understand how they received a 4.6 rating????  Ambiance="A" We sat out back in a patio setting filled with interesting trees. Appetizers="D" The mushroom tarte must have been frozen and then microwaved to order. The octopus came with a chorizo "leather" that was not very appealing. Entrees="D" & "B" The lobster ravioli pasta was about as thick as the chorizo leather. The lobster ravioli sauce was lacking flavor and any depth. I had the sea bass and it was good. Properly cooked piece of fish with a decent sauce. For entertainment value, you must engage with the "somelier" Bruce, it will be self explanatory. Hands down, one of the most leading reviews I've seen on Google. We would not return to Le Vallauris if the meal was free.</text>< Rate>

From the warm welcome Patrice gives you, to Paul's meandering welcome to everyone dining, on top of fantastic food (lobster ravioli, veal and steak tartare being among my favourites) and great service from the attentive and charming staff ... this is definitely a favourite.</Text>

<Date>1386050687145< /Date><text>We lunched there the Monday after Thanksgiving, so it was sparsely populated, and we got to sit anywhere we liked in their gorgeous courtyard. The service was wonderfully friendly and unpretentious, especially since we were dressed in hiking gear.

I tried the boar pâté, which was decent, and the hangar steak which was fantastic. Would probably eat here again.< /text><user>108671711900632443325</user><Rating>4< /Rating><name>Aaron D'Souza</name><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Where to begin? I had heard nothing but great things about this French restaurant. I was really excited to enjoy amazing food with 4 of my best friends on the last day of the year. We were lucky to get a reservation (we thought) and our taste buds would be exploding with amazing flavors.
From the moment we walked in, we were met with an overcrowded entrance/lobby which was surprising to me. I thought we had a reservation to start enjoying dinner at 845. Instead, we were moved into the bar area where a band was setting up and a dance floor, which was overcrowded with others waiting to be seated as well.
We had to seek someone out from the restaurant in order to get a table after waiting almost an hour. That is not what you expect from an upscale locale. Once seated, we were surprised to discover that there was a pre-fixe menu with a cost of $160 per person. Having prior fine dining experience I wasn’t thrown off by the price, as long as the food was up to par.
After placing our orders we each enjoyed our appetizers and the excitement was increasing for me, a great meal was about to be enjoyed.
That’s where it went all wrong. Our waitress and her assistant started putting spoons out as cutlery for our next dish. We thought perhaps a pleasant surprise was in store, perhaps a nice French bisque soup or something exciting.
Instead, our deserts were brought out. We all stopped the waitress and let her know we had yet to receive our main dishes. I had ordered the Branzino however when it came, I smelled it and immediately knew it had sat too long or was not fresh. We asked if we could exchange it for another item. We were able to exchange it for the lobster.
Sadly, the lobster (3 of which where ordered by our table) was cold. That is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber. I took one or two bites and just left it, I was not about to go down that slippery slope of suffering through a bad dish. My other friend ordered chateaubriand and she was also surprised at the coldness of the temperature. Now I was upset that the restaurant we had been looking forward to all weekend was underdelivering on expectations.
The meal ended with a subpar dessert, in which the main waitress had to correct the direction of the placement of the dessert.
Before leaving I requested to speak with the manager, which never happened. Instead, we were given the on lobster off at market price ($48). I did make a call the following day and spoke with the manager, who let the owner know and he would be calling me back.
The result of the call was as follows: nobody else complained about the evening and the pre-fixe price included entertainment (band), dancing and party favors. They don’t like to rush people so if we were expecting to be in and out they apologize for that experience. However, they have been having this event for the past 45 years. I guess we should know their history, despite this being our very first visit to the restaurant. He was unwilling to credit or offer a discount for our experience (nearly a $900 meal) but rather offer a complimentary bottle of champagne upon our next visit.
No thank you, this place is dated and the way things are dealt with in a service industry that relies on reputation lets me know that we are not the caliber of diners they host. I sure wish I had a different experience. I will let any person who asks about this restaurant to steer way clear.
Not impressed, extremely underwhelmed and absolutely offended.</Text>

Visited this restaurant after reading positive reviews, however our experience was negative. Greeted by a maitre d' with a sense of humour bypass. Shown to a table crammed in between other diners when most of the restaurant was empty, then moved to another table after we declined the cramming. Were served a bottle of water and some bread and were then forgotten despite there being more waiters than clientele. We weren't even shown a menu. After waiting 15 minutes, we paid for our water, explained why we were leaving to shrugs 'who cares' from the miserable maitre d' and left.< /Text>

<review>Le Vallauris Restaurant, has a vigerious and detrimend staff. Starting with the Valet, which are owned and operated by a woman but extends her twin sister and her father as her main employees. They are there every day except in July and August when the season is closed due to hot temperatures. The hoast when you come in are very nice, welcoming, and make sure you are seated right away along with your guest. The waiter and buss boys were great. The only thing that was not right, was when we received our drinks.we waited for up to 10 minutes to get an ice tea. This was up setting, due to the fact that we cheer our hoast whom is picking up the bill and to our veterans. Overall, the food was very delicious , well proportion you , and had a great ambience.<//review>< pics>

I have been introduced to the restaurant and to Paul and Omar in 2005. Whenever in Palm Springs I make it a destination at least to eat there once. Two years ago my fiancé went with me for the first time and for both of us traveling to many place in Europe, Le Vallarius has the most exquisite food, superb service, a wine selection out of this world, the most romantic ambiance and Paul and Omar are the hosts with most gentlemanly manners.
Looking very much forward to start the New Year there with a fabulous dinner again and to celebrate it with our friends.

Note, onsite parking is very limited, with "valet" service available, we opted for street parking and walked the few steps to the front door.

Our host must've been tired - his less than enthusiastic greeting, coupled with a mechanical "follow me", made us think back to a crabby greeter at a Denny's  (apologies to Denny's). With no eye contact, he mumbled something unintelligible, weaving his way towards the back patio seating area.

Plenty of seating for two was available, but despite being well-dressed we felt like our back wall seating missed the mark (see photos).

A magic marker style menu on an easel was plopped down with scribbled specials (no notes re accompaniments or sides), followed by a fixed price, two choice menu. Passed on that.

Our waitress was cheerful and attentive but somehow a couple that showed up after us received their appetizers first.

We shared the escargot, my wife had a delicious and well-prepared filet mignon $43.00, I had the passable .5lb (after shelling) sautéed lobster $48.00. A half-ish glass of red or white wine will set you back $14 - $18 each. Various meh greens on a bed of doughy something finished the plating.

Sadly, Le Vallauris has probably seen better days - indicated by the faded TripAdvisor and other gradings posted at the front entrance.

Tucked away in a vintage residential area, the eateries on Palm Canyon, a couple of blocks away, might provide more for a gift certificate.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

(Translated by Google) It's good to eat at the terrace seat at night
Escargot and lamb chops are recommended

(Original)
夜はテラス席でお食事がいいですね
エスカルゴやラムチョップがオススメです<//review>

I was referred to CPR by another business that didn't have the tools necessary to replace the cracked screen. I found Bruce to be professional and patient in identifying the problem and finding the part for replacement. The price was fair and he had the tools and skill to replace the touchscreen. I now have my son's laptop back in like-new condition! I will definitely be back for any other electronic repair needs. I live in Rancho Cordova but it is definitely worth the drive to Roseville.

Amazing tech wizards at an affordable price.
A couple of days ago, I completely shattered my galaxy S20 under my chair. There was no screen left to speak of and no touch response. I had a microSD card inside with all my precious photos which was encrypted by the now crushed phone. The broken phone was the only phone that could decrypt it. I was able to replace the phone from the insurance, but I lost the priceless photos. As a last ditch effort, I called CPR Phone Repair and asked them for help. They were able to swap out the motherboard from the broken phone into a fresh body, which allowed me to access my phone and decrypt the card. I was also able to use smart switch to copy everything from my broken phone to the new phone, which literally saved me hours of work. Then after factory reset, they swapped the motherboard back into the original broken phone body so I can return it to the insurance company. All that for just $100. They were very professional and upfront about everything. I would highly recommend them.<//text>

<Text>Took my surface pro there today. I told Bruce it wouldn't come on after auto update. Bruce was so helpful. He checked out the device to see what might be wrong and was able to restart the device. Then he looked at battery life for me and setup settings. He showed me how to restart in the future and how to remove unwanted items  safely so i can free up space. Cost? Very reasonable!!  Up and running for $20 as it did not have to go into the  rear of shop to fix. The other shops were going to charge me a $89 to $100 diagnostic fee and quoted approximately $400 to fix.  As a senior who is used to being overcharged, this was a refreshing change. HIGHLY RECOMMEND CPR REPAIR IN ROSEVILLE.

This proprietors arrogance knows no bounds.  I was quoted $130for a replacement screen for my motto g7  , you can buy a new one for $119. I also got a quote on a ps4 with a bad hard drive,  this he said would be no less than $175 because he wouldn't know what other issues he might run in to once he started working on it.  Sony will replace my hard drive for $106 postage and packaging with limited warranty.  This guy is a crook.</text>

<response>{'time': 1596310296003, 'text': 'We are sorry you have a water damaged phone which is one of the most difficult things to deal with in electronics work.  Part of your response we agree with, part of it is totally inaccurate.  You were given lots of useful information when you were here that you could have discussed with you insurance company to reach a decision on how to proceed.\nYou were correct there is no option to just look at the inside of a water damaged phone and render an accurate opinion on if it is fixable or not and what the cost is going to be which we indicated to you.  You are correct we told you the phone might not work after water damage repair work which is one potential outcome due to the nature of the corrosion process that gets started on components inside electronic devices that have had any liquid in them that contains water.  This is why we spend time at the front counter providing this information so customers understand it before any work is performed.\nIt would be unethical for us to give you a hard dollar cost estimate of the repair work at the front counter on this type of repair without us knowing if the repair has any chance of being successful  without performing  water damage treatment work first for which there is an upfront fee which we indicated to you.\nUnfortunately, there is a lot of miss-information regarding this type of work.  We have fixed a lot of water damaged devices for customers who are very grateful we were able to save their device or at least get it back to a working state to save their information.  We have also seen a lot of water damaged devices never function again after many labor hours of work due to the nature of what corrosion can do to electronic components inside the devices.\nIf you had a cracked screen or a physically damaged charge port on the phone we would have gladly provided a written repair cost estimate.  Why you did not discuss the information we gave you regarding the nature of this type of work with your insurance company to determine how to proceed is beyond us.  They might have said ok we will reimburse the Water Damage treatment upfront fee to find out if it is repairable and what the cost is and if it shuts down we will reimburse for another phone up to a certain dollar amount after a deductible is paid or they might have said ok just ask them to put in writing what they discussed with you and we will considered calling the claim Beyond Economic Repair based on the unknown upper end cost factor, or they might have indicated a different direction.\nWe do work for insurance companies nationwide and due to the unpredictable nature of water damaged electronic device work we will not be prompted to do something unethical or misleading in a dollar cost repair estimate based on a negative review.'}<//response><time>1596246462751< /time>< pictures>

<Text>First I tried to obtain a quote online, then I called and left a message, no response. Having a high rating I figured they were busy so I went in store. I needed some sort of estimate for my insurance. For a business that advertises they fix water damage in phones I was given no useful information. No option to have the phone looked at, no base estimate or high end estimate, nothing. I was told the phone might not even work after repair... which they never offered to repair so how does that work? Never again.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Husband took his phone here to have a non screen related repair done, and he called for a quote and was told $45 for the work. When he got instore the gentleman helping him said it would be $95 and denied that he or anyone there said $45. Thenthe tech asked for the phone passcode. DO NOT GIVE THIS EVER! If you’re getting a screen replaced test it when you pick it up. If someone has your passcode they have access to all your info. Such a scammy thing to be asking for. Go somewhere reputable for your cell phone repair.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The CPR Cell-Phone is absolutely great my iPhone XS brook the screen and I was looking for places to fix it and I found CPR close by my work and I decided to go there and Bruce was such helpful, it’s took them only 2 hours to fixed my iPhone and the price was great, they did such great job and  my iPhone look brand new,
I am really happy and I highly recommend my friends and family to go to CPR.
Thank you very much Bruce.<//Review>

< Review>
Their website does not actually gives quotes, it's just a landing page made to bring you in to the store.  They do not check emails generated by website or direct emails.  Impossible to reach by phone either.  The store has one person working, who does not process customers, but repairs one device at a time while the people in line wait to be seen.  The overall experience is worse than DMV.  After about 45 minutes in line behind 3 customers, with no movement at all I left the store.  I was finally able to reach someone after about 50 phonecalls over 4 days, and asked them to reply to my email with the information about the repair I needed.  They have said that the repair will cost more than a new device...  Why list it on your website then???  Would definitely not recommend this place.  Sadly, there's not any alternatives in the area either...<//Review>

CPR Staff was patient and kind on the phone.  They had a stock screen for my LG G6 and they fixed it in an hour.  As a note I visited every kiosk in the Galleria and no one stocked my screen.  The service experience and timely repair were worth the extra $$.  Thank you CPR!</text>

<Review>Had some water damage and it was recommended to have the phone cleaned for $95. Received a call a few days later recommending a new screen and battery for another $250. I relayed it wasn't worth it. Picked up the phone and noticed the phone wouldn't even turn on and the screen was glued together sloppy. Disappointed.<//Review>< Pics>

Quoted me 120$ for the fan when it’s 27$ to be replaced. This isn’t right because I had already paid upfront for the labor.

Service was great, very clean in relation to the current pandemic by wiping down devices prior to and after fixing devices. Very quick turn around to get the phone repaired, and very reasonably priced for repair service. Staff was very professional when speaking to them on the phone and in person.< /review>

I would give a 5 star rating after service is completed (to no fault of CPR). Besides that, the technician was nice, helpful, very informative. I would recommend CPR to anyone in need of cell phone repairs.</text>

The service was immediate and my issues were listened  to carefully.  I just had a battery changed but it was completed in the time stated.  I thought the price a little high, hense the 4 stars.  Being a first time Iphone user I don't know the going price so It could be "my bad".< /review>

< Review>
I brought my phone in because it was having problems charging- other than that, i had a really great phone that was perfect for me and I had excellent service through Verizon.
I paid this man I think his name was Glenn, who said he would have it fixed the next day- the next day I picked up my phone which yes would now charge properly, but these people went through my personal messages, changed things under my settings, downloaded GAMES (i dont play games on my phone)  they had changed the DATE AND TIME SETTINGS- i don't understand why they did this to me?  Anyways BEWARE.  These people are weird and RUDE.< /Review>

Iphone charger wouldn't connect.  CPR determined the port was jammed and repaired
without needing to replace parts.  Also quickly fixed a cracked screen saver.  Very timely
service and open as advertised.  Thank you CPR.<//text>

<Text>Found CPR on Google Search. Battery failed and I needed  a new one for my Note 8. I decided to wait for the repair to be completed. It took about 1 hour 30 minutes. My phone is working like new. I was very happy to have the phone repaired quickly since my cell phone is the only phone I  own.  Suggest you give GPR a try.  I was very pleased with there service. I will use CPR again in the future.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Couldn’t have been a smoother experience. Great team to work with, really nice people and super fast. Thanks so much for fixing my iPad screen! You’d never know I busted it. :)

Also—please give these guys a break if your device is not totally repairable or if it’s toast. It’s not their fault your device is busted. They can fix a ton of stuff but don’t have a magic wand to repair the entire world. It’s sort of like if your car has some minor damage and can go to the body shop or if it’s totaled and is headed for the scrap metal yard. Sometimes accidents happen and we deal with it and move on. We’re lucky that folks like CPR are around to even fix stuff.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

They told me they could fix my play station Vita so i paid their $35 bench fee. Two weeks goes by and i get told twice they're " trying to find parts" I dont think they know how to fix games, maybe phones. The techs i spoke to sounded incompetent and making excuses. I picked it up without it being fixed to bring it to a real repair shop. I will never go back here for any serviced!< /text>

I took my Android II into the shop and had the battery replaced.  Simple job but when I picked up the phone I was told that there was a line on the screen.  Other than the battery needing replacement there was nothing wrong with the phone and especially NO Line through the screen.  I was told that nothing could be done other than purchase a new phone or take the battery out.  I am extremely disappointed with the lack of professionalism and unwillingness to stand by their work and correct the issue.</review>

<text>I came here to replace the battery on my aging phone. The process seemed quite difficult for me to do myself with the phone's water-tight casing. CPR Phone Repair did a good job replacing it.

After the replacement, I didn't see any noticeable scratches or problems with the casing afterwards, and the sealing was good. When I initially received the phone back, part of the screen lost touch capability, but they were able to fix that on the second try within an hour. The price and speed of repair were excellent. The initial delivery of the battery part took a bit long at about 2 weeks (which got me a little worried), but the replacement itself was only 1-2 hours.

So far, the new battery life seems quite good and lasts many hours (compared to 30 minutes for my old, dying battery). I'm hoping it'll last another 6-12 months before I need to replace the aging phone for good.

My only issue with the repair was that it was sometimes difficult to contact the store by phone/email. It would sometimes take a full day before I would receive email responses, and I couldn't always reach them by phone. In my experience, leaving a voicemail was the only consistently reliable form of communication.< /text><Gmap_id>0x809b1ff6d306913b:0xcafaa850edcb36a1</Gmap_id>< UserId.>

<user_name>Vitaliy Morozov<//user_name><review>I wouldn't recommend to come to this place. I brought my phone because I wanted to replace a bad battery. In order to do that, you have to remove the screen. And I didn't want to mess with it. After I picked it up, later during that day I noticed that my screen started to pop up.  I brought it back and they promised to fix it. I came back after my work and checked the phone. Glue was all over the phone screen. I could see it on almost every edge (see pictures). This is Moto Z which has Moto mods like extra battery and they dropped a glue on it as well. Now it looks so ugly. So, it is up to you. I don't know why they have such a high rating. If you want to replace screen protector then you could come there. For anything else, use it on your own risk. You might end up with buying a new phone after their service.</review>< Pics>

Went here to get my charging port replaced, took about a week to get the part ordered and get the piece replaced. It worked for about a week and then stopped charging again. I ended up having to just buy a new cell phone. The customer service was good, prices were a little high but they did the job, the phone had more damage than originally thought.</review>

I have a moto z play droid and dropped it when the screen went black but it was still working but the screen wasn't turning on. I could hear it turning on and off when pressing the power button. It had some internal damage. The screen didn't crack (I had a screen protector). Mailed it to CPR repair and they fixed it no problem. I was scared that my contacts, pictures, and notes would disappear in the process but everything was still on it when I got it back. Paid around 150 and they did a wonderful job.</text>

Great store! I needed help reviving an old phone that wouldn't charge in order to extract important data. Bruce was able to help me work out a plan to get the phone running long enough to transfer my files into my new phone. He did it with no problem and in under an hour! He was extremely helpful, and now all my photos, contacts, and apps are now accessible on my current phone.
Thanks Bruce!!<//Review>

I just chattered my iphone screen.  Walked in and the staff was polite and helpful.  The gentleman at the front desk said they could fix the phone and to come back in 1.5 hours.  I came in about 15 minutes early and it was fixed.  I recommend going to this store for all electronics needs.  They prices are reasonable as well.</text>

He even did a  better job than the staff at Verizon who installed the original screen protector with bubbles left behind. This time, no bubbles. If you have the warranty on the screen protector it costs $10 for replacement and install at CPR. It's a lot better to take your phone here than having the replacement screen protector shipped to you (which costs $10 for shipping & processing) and having to install it yourself.  This is my second time taking my phones here and so far I've had great experiences. I'll definitely continue to take my phones here for any repairs.

<rate>1< /rate><review>Update!

I will not be using this service now or in the future.

I reached out to this location's owner and left my information for a return call that never happened. Corporate could not help me because each location is individually owned and it is preferred that I handle my situation with the location directly; which obviously failed.

I decided to call the CPR location in Rancho Cordova and was very satisfied with the assistance the representative there provided. I forgot his name but he was able to reach out to a Bruce at the Roseville location and came back with a better explanation than what was provided to my wife or what I got over the phone.

The Rancho rep told me that Bruce stated Bruce misquoted me when I used the CPR estimate off their website; so, the Roseville location will not honor the quote. Supposedly, the quote I received was for a camera lens replacement only; even though, the email clearly stated screen and lcd replacement.

I am very disappointed in this service. The quote should have been honored, in my case, and then corrected for future cases.
-----
I received a quote for a screen and lcd replacement from the CPR website. CPR emailed me a confirmation email with the quote and scheduled me an appointment with this location.

On the morning of the appointment, the employee at this location was shown the email quote and expressly stated he would not honor the quote as he believed it was a mis-quote. The employee, then, stated that he would charge almost 4 times what CPR originally quoted. He took a picture of the CPR email and stated that he would contact corporate.

The on the spot quote was not acceptable and this service was not used. A complaint has been filed with CPR corporate and a message was left on their social media website.

I will update when I receive a response.< /review>< Pictures>

<username>Emily Rabasto<//username><text>My puppy got to my phone yesterday morning and chewed the corner of my screen on my Samsung Galaxy S5 to the point where the screen was black and the touch sensitivity was broken. I was recommended CPR Roseville after going to the AT&T store where they told me that, even though I have insurance, the cost to fix the screen would be less than my deductible and they could not guarantee that it would be able to be fixed after sending it in for a couple of days.
I went down to CPR of Douglas at 11 a.m., was given a clear estimate of $250 including labor and had my phone back in perfect working condition by 1:30 p.m. the same day.
Bruce was the man at the counter who helped me, and he was efficient, polite and quick. Thank you so much for saving my phone!< /text>< gmapID>

<Review>Stopped in to have my Droid phone battery replaced, was told it would have to be ordered in.  I was worried it would take a long time, but got a call in just 3 days!  I brought my phone back and they replaced it while I waited.  Knowledgeable, friendly supportive staff!  I will bring other tech business here and recommend that you do also!</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I recommend this place to everyone! I wish I had brought in previous phones that I thought were dead forever! My iPhone 6 crapped out and I thought I'd lost photos and videos that I didn't back-up. Turns out it was a burnt out capacitor on the whatcha-ma-call-it board. I can't believe they fixed my phone!!! I am so happy! These guys are life savers and their prices didn't break my bank (which I was afraid of). Couldn't be happier!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I had a Nexus 4 screen repaired there and was very satisfied with the result.  I called ahead and Bruce said they had the part in stock.  I dropped it off at about 11am and had it back by 2pm the same day.  The service was professional and the quality seemed great (replacement screen looks like the original).  I wouldn't call it cheap, but CPR was $25 less than Yakey Yak, so it was less expensive, which is always a bonus.  Highly recommended.</Text>< Pictures>

Wet cell phone repaired with new screen and one soldered connection for the camera.
Expensive but much less than a new phone and the data saved was priceless.
Back up your phone regularly and if you do you wouldn't lose as much if the phone can't be repaired.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Not impressed to say the least with their customer service. I droped off a phone for repair around noon and was told they would keep me updated of the status. About an hour before closing time I tried calling the store multiple times with no answer. I called the next day after they opened, again no answer so I left a message. The entire day went by and I called again around 5pm, and finally got to speak with an employee who stated it would take an additional 2 days to diagnose the problem. Two days later I finally recived a call saying my phone was ready to pick up, now in worse condition than when I droped it off. Then phone won't work at all now, so I have a paper weight and im out $35 "diagnostic fee"  This place lacks any sort of communication. Also be ready to wait at least 15-20 minutes per customer for anyone in line ahead of you.< /Review><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Outstanding customer service!!  My I-pad was fixed in 4 hours; a far cry from another company, who made me wait a week  before telling me the I-pad was still unfixed.  It had been promised in 2-3 days.  CPR is my choice for any repairs I have in the future.< /Review>

You want a no-nonsense, straightforward phone repair? Here it is. No upsale, no fluff. And a ridiculously long receipt.< /text>

Their prices were more than fair, great customer service and product knowledge. They fix phones, iPads, iPods etc. They fixed in within 5 days of us dropping it off. A great little find for us. They are now our "go to" people when issues come up. Check them out - you won't be disappointed!<//review><gmapID>0x809b1ff6d306913b:0xcafaa850edcb36a1<//gmapID>< Rating>

<Text>Instead of having to deal with Asurion's terrible service I decided to give this shop a try. Bruce changed my battery for under $100 in my Moto Z Droid. It took 2  hours but it was worth the wait. 2 hour battery life is now at 20 hours. Awesome, friendly, and efficient.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>SO. My phone had somehow bricked itself after not being charged and the screen coming off and it not being used. I took it into these guys and they fixed it!! AND THEN it bricked itself AGAIN. I took it back to them to see what had happened, and they worked on it for two days, and very polite when I periodically called to check in. They don't see problems like this very often so they tried EVERYTHING. New screens, new batteries, new charging ports. They ended up not being able to fix the problem and said this is something that happens very randomly and very, very rarely. They were able to give me a few options like a partial refund or putting my money towards a phone from them. I ended up going with the partial refund but they were so helpful, and I could tell they cared so even though my phone never worked again, I appreciate their help and the fact that they gave me no trouble about a refund. 100% reccommended.<//review><resp>None< /resp><date>1515182208957<//date>< pictures>

My father went in because his charger cable would not plug into his phone.. They told him the contacts were broke and could fix for $90.  He brought it to my house and it took a needle and 2 minutes to remove a piece of lint in the port.  They are either incompetent or saw a senior citizen as an easy target.< /Review>

<text>I went in to get my playstation repaired, luckily enough the job was accepted. It required a minor component replacement, which I expected to take no longer than about 4-5 business days. The job was finished within a week and a half with mediocre customer service. I feel like I was overpaid quite a bit for the part and labor.  Nevertheless, the problem was solved and I am greatful.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>Iphone Repair / IPhone 6s Plus -  I found this company by searching online and I’ve also been driving by it for many years I went in there and found them to be very kind and helpful their prices are very fair in fact it’s cheaper to go here than anywhere in the mall so I’d recommend going here for your iPhone repairs they can pretty much do anything with any iPad iPhone or any electronics including X boxes which reminds me I need to take my Xbox there to get the disk Drive fixed !

<Review>I dropped my phone and cracked the screen. I had it fixed here for $90. After a few weeks the new screen started to pop out along with having some dead spots, and I took it back to have it fixed. The guy was very rude and acknowledged that it was his fault, but tried to offer me a "discount" of $85. I told him that was just $5 less than I had it done for the first time, and he said "yeah." So now I have $90 less in my wallet and a still broken phone. I basically got robbed.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Went to the store twice, first time after standing in line for 20 mins, I was told too busy come back any other day. Tried to go back today stood in line for another 20 mins only to be told sorry too close to closing time come back some other time. All I want is a screen protector!!!
Poor service, long lines, business hours meaningless.< /Review>

I called sec
I called several big name places that do computer and phone repairs to see about geting my Acer Tablet shattered screen repaired. Other places had one excuse after another from too old to parts no longer available. I called this place and Bruce was friendly reasonable and after researching to see if he could get parts , called me back to tell me I could bring my tablet in. After going over options, device cost to replace verses cost  to repair. I wanted to keep my device. I had to put half down of the price Quoted,
Which was $70.00, ($35.00 down) amd he would give it a try. It took a minute to get the parts, but I couldn't be happier. Bruce also is extremely knowledgeable about mechanics and is more than happy to take the time to explain in laymen terms how things operate to his customers. This was a great experience for me and I feel like I got more than a fair price for the work. That's hard to do these days. Thank so much CPR.< /review>

I took my phone there spent 250 to get screen fixed got it back and it was glitching and I barley could use it then the screen popped out and the gentleman proceeded to tell me I needed another screen! but so generously gave me a "discount" after getting it fixed for a second time it was still glitching I asked what is wrong and they said it was nothing they could fix. Well my phone completely stopped working the screen was unresponsive! My dad ended up calling the one in  Rancho and they said they get that problem all the time and it was an easy fix and that this place should of never charged me for a second screen! So my advice avoid this place at all cost! Make a trip and go to rancho they know what they are doing!!!! And I went in with the durable screen protector I purchased from Apple and somehow I came out with the cheap screen protector......

<Review>First time using CPR and was very happy with the price I was quoted for glass and digitizer replacement. Repairs where done same day and Bruce was very friendly. However, My Samsung Galaxy Mega did not operate correctly. The screen was just really wonky. So I went back and Bruce said it was a bad digitizer and he would replace it. Well after the second repair the screen is still wonky just not as wonky as the first time. Great service means nothing if the phone dose not work.<//Review><gmap_id>0x809b1ff6d306913b:0xcafaa850edcb36a1<//gmap_id></record>

I am only giving this an 3 star rating because of a girl named Brianna and  the tech who fixed my phone they we're great!  Have four puppies who discovered my phone in my sleep and used it as a chew toy. I have broken my screen a grand total of 4 times now. After paying $250 the first time I learned how to do it myself. Screen cost around $150. Unfortunately I was only able to find CPR who had my screen in stock and it is against their policy she just sell the screen. Brianna told me on the phone it could take up to 2 hours.being that I have put on my own screen I know it shouldn't. I assumed that time frame was because people we're ahead of me. Again... no biggie. I rush there. No line. And as told techs didn't have much ahead of me. I explain that I can't wait 2hrs to this old man that assisted me. Never got his name. He was so rude he made me cry. I had an appointment at 1pm and couldn't miss it. I needed my phone for this appointment. It had filed and photos I had to show. He then continued to ask me if I still need to do this, as if it we're a waist of his time. And explain the process that is so difficult with my phone. Once again I would like to say I have done it myself two parts of the screen has the prest on and then you press the screen down on the adhesive and bam. I come back in about 25-30 minutes and Brianna tells me that they're working on my phone and shouldn't be more then 30 minutes. She did her best she's my frustration and worry and had me out of there as fast as she could. Even took down my number to call me the second it was ready so that way I wasn't waiting for it. She was fantastic and very friendly. A big smile at all times I would have given this place 5 stars being that I got it done as fast as possible did a great job and her customer service was at 100%. I give it 3 stars because the gentleman who was older and signed me in was by far the rudest person I've ever met in customer service. When I told him how important it was that the phone not be ready after 1. And it was an emergency he said everybody's in a hurry and everybody has an emergency do you want me to finish this or not. I will not go back there solely because of the price, and that man. But everything else was fantastic had a nice variety of phone cases phone chargers and headphones. They used a generic screen which I don't like. But there is a warranty on it.<//Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>This place is a joke went in there with a broken screen on the back camera they told me like $55 and I was fine with that. They took off the screen and proceeded to tell me my camera was scratched all over and that they could replace the camera for $150 they then proceeded to show me all the scratches. I ended up just replacing the screen.. After a day or two the "scratches" we're getting to me so I went to another place they took off the screen and ended up just being fabric pieces and dirt. So long story short they never even wiped the camera off and tried to sell me $150 camera which I didn't need. But who knows they might not even been going to replace my camera just wipe it off and say they did. These people I believe are scam artist, please do the smart thing and take your business elsewhere. THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST STRAIGHT INCOMPETENT!!!</Review><userid>116392318429759051141< /userid><Rating>1< /Rating>< Date>

<text>Smacked the display on a galaxy s4 and display stopped working. Took it into CPR and even having told them that the screen had been cracked, they looked at it for 5 minutes and sent me out the door with a diagnosis of dead battery... They don't listen and do not not know what they're doing.</text>< pictures>

Bastards left some sort of cleaning solution on my BRAND NEW cell phone sleeve-not even 1 day old!!  When I called them about it, they told me to come back.  As I was giving them my info, the call got dropped.  Immediately called back and they denied my call JUST A MINUTE AGO and said that was stain that I could've caused!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I'm only giving them ONE STAR b/c I want people to know these folks are robbers and you could get your phone fixed for hellava lots cheaper elsewhere!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Review>

Friendly, professional staff; they don't have my part in stock and need to order it, but the price is better than comparable shops in the surrounding area and worth the wait. :)< /Review>

My 6p desperately needed a new battery and had a cracked screen. We called CPR to see if they could put a new battery in and we were surprised when they said that they could do it. Repair shops closer to home either said they never heard of my phone or that they would need to keep it for up to two weeks. CPR replaced the battery and informed us that the crack was only on the screen protector which they replaced - all in about an hour.<//text>

The staff at Eaves are second to none. The complex and halls are constantly being attended to and cleaned. Shawne Perez (Community Coordinator) and Ioana Alonso (Sales and Service Supervisor) and Nick (front desk?) are particular standouts. Even after I moved out they were helpful. They didn’t hit me with the “goodbye we’re keeping your deposit and charging you more for other stuff too” either. That’s a horror story I was happy to avoid. I can’t stress enough how amazing the staff are, they can actually turn your day around. The cops in Seal Beach are also awesome and worth a follow on social media.<//Review>

I have lived at the Eaves Seal Beach complex for a total of five years now. I can’t think of any other complex I would want to live in the area.

The leasing staff are also very accommodating to needs any suggestions. Ioana and Richard keep the place running top notch! I feel very fortunate to be able to live here.< /text>

<Review>Edit- eaves started a run club - so fun!

tl;dr - there's probably no such thing as a perfect apartment complex, but we plan on staying here for the helpful staff, well-maintained grounds, and amenities.

The amenities at eaves SB are really nice and the grounds are very well-maintained. Even though we don't use the pool/hot tub often, they are always sparkling clean. Maintenance staff is super quick to respond and helpful. They really go above and beyond. Everyone in the leasing office is helpful and friendly, especially Nicole and Nick!

The units are recently remodeled and are very nice - though the windows and slider doors could probably be replaced, as they are single-pane and offer very little for soundproofing or temperature control. Some of the finishes on the apartments are a little off - the floors have some bubbling issues, some of the paint has flaked off in spots, and I wish there were a few more outlets in the living room and bedroom so we wouldn't have to use surge protectors. One other issue that we've had is that smoking is allowed in units, and since the buildings are a little older, the ventilation isn't always great and smoke is sometimes noticable inside the apartment - this is especially true when the windows are open, but even when they're closed the smell sometimes wafts around. We don't smoke, so it's just a bit annoying (not to mention, problematic for people with respiratory issues.)

Though the price of the units may seem a little high, we've done a lot of research and for the location (0.5 mi to the beach), the amenities, washer/dryer in-unit, parking, quality of maintenance, and convenience of being part of a larger apartment community, we think it's worth the price.</Review></record>

< review>
Eaves Seal Beach has the best staff. Everyone is kind and helpful. It's almost unreal, never had a bad experience. I recently submitted a maintenance request for a slowly dripping pipe under my sink (far from an emergency) and only a couple hours later someone was at my door to fix it.

My apartment is nice. Stainless steel appliances, sleek looking countertops, a large bathroom, patio, good looking flooring that is durable and easy to clean.

There are many amenities. A pool, volleyball court, indoor gym, outdoor workout area, bike storage locker, there's an Amazon hub onsite which makes it really easy and secure to receive packages (never had one stolen here).

I'm happy with the location. Close to PCH, about 5 minute drive from the 22, 405, and 605 freeways. There are 4 grocery stores and 2 pharmacies, and countless restaurants within walking distance. It takes me 8 minutes to walk to the beach from my apartment door.

Eaves is dog-friendly. I love dogs. Just be aware that it is not uncommon to hear them barking at night.

My only complaint really has nothing to do with Eaves and more to do with one of my neighbors, who can be loud at times. In general though, the other residents I've encountered here are friendly and respectful.<//review>

I agree with the review of other residents, such as Eaves Seal Beach, a lovely place close to the beach, well-maintained ground, great amenities, excellent office staff especially Ioana, she is a very professional and friendly person, and the maintenance department provides excellent resident service requests. We had a problem with our bathroom clogged sink Friday night (7/16/21); the water rose to cause overflow. I called the emergency line to report the situation because I’m worried about the flood that will cause damage to the floor. A technician came, used a plunger and plumbing snake but it didn’t work. There was a challenge about the sink being clogged that night. However, the following morning, here comes technician Cesar to the rescue. Cesar is the man; very knowledgeable and professional technician, he finished the job well done.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1627652765562, 'text': "Thank you, Cres!

I love eaves/Seal Beach. No complaints. I love the speed of service calls, communication, and cooperation of all staff. Proximity to the beach, bike path and wonderful shopping is the icing on the cake!

In particular, I want to commend Rafael in helping me to deal with the flooding in my laundry room. He was fast, friendly and efficient on 2 calls.

Thank you Rafael!

David came today to respond to my maintenance request. On a Sunday just a few hours from when I entered it! He was efficient, fixed every little thing on my list, and communicated all the steps as we went. I hardly have to put in maintenance requests for my newly renovated apartment, but it’s great to have this knowledgeable staff on hand!  Thanks so much David and team :)</text>

<Review>My only complaint is the allowance of smoking in units. I understand this is the policy right now, but it should be changed for three reasons. Firstly, in-unit smoking permeates not just the smoker's unit; it also invades surrounding units via walls, which is extremely unpleasant. Secondly, it's a health hazard via SECONDHAND SMOKE INHALATION. Thirdly, allowing in-unit smoking is a FIRE HAZARD and therefore ENDANGERMENT. Hopefully, Avalon might consider that and change their policy on allowing smoking in and around the buildings.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>I have been a resident here at Eaves Seal Beach for five years now. Absolutely loved it when I moved in, and I can say with no hesitation I love it just as much now if not a little more.  So I am going to do some thing that I very rarely do. Post a review.

I had lived in Seal Beach once before. I have also lived in Huntington Beach, and Long Beach. Rest assured, there is no comparison. Seal Beach is a small town. If you’re going down PCH and you blink you could easily miss it.  But I think that’s what makes it so special! It feels kind of exclusive to live here. I can almost 100% guarantee you that if somebody tells you they live in Seal Beach that they will have a smile on their face when they do it.

When I first came here I was shown several apartments in several different buildings. I selected  a ground floor apartment with a nice view of a beautiful courtyard right outside my sliding glass door.  There are 2 barbecues, always well-maintained, about 50 feet away from my patio.  More scattered throughout the complex including several by the pool. And the people here are wonderful. It must be a product of the environment because I can honestly say I cannot remember anybody that didn’t smile and say hello back when I said hello to them.  And you see plenty of people! This complex is pet friendly. There are people going back-and-forth by my apartment almost constantly walking their pets.  I even have one neighbor who’s cat must think it’s a dog! She walks it on a leash and I have watched that cat walk up to dogs that could easily swallow it whole with no fear!  Good entertainment at no charge!

The people working here are amazing. I want to thank the office staff.  Ioana, Nicole, Richard, Valerie, and Chris. Each and every one of them is awesome. And the maintenance staff here. Absolutely top notch! The simple fact is that I have not often needed them.  But when I did they were prompt, and attentive, and rarely did I have the same problem twice. I understand that the buildings are 20 years old. You would never know that to look at them. My own apartment was renovated just a few years ago.  New appliances, fresh paint, and the laundry facilities that were right down the hall when I moved in? Not needed anymore! I now have a washer and dryer in my apartment. What was good to start with only got better!

If you’re fortunate enough to have a chance to move to this area I cannot recommend Eaves by Avalon in Seal Beach enough. The people, the amenities, the occasional treat like lunch trucks serving dinner by the pool!  I have absolutely no intention or desire to move any time in the near future! I hope this review will convince you to check this place out. And if you do I will look forward to crossing your path and saying hello when you move in!

Best Regards-

I had a potential flood issue with my laundry this morning and immediately called the front office and spoke with Nicholas who is always so kind and helpful. He had Cesar from maintenance come to my unit right away to solve the issue. Cesar did a fantastic job and worked quickly. We talked about our love for animals while he worked. Very good stress free experience.</text>

<review>So I moved in August 2020. Unfortunately because of Covid the amenities have been closed and I have not had the full experience. Even with Covid all the people in the leasing office have been wonderful and responsive! Nicole was amazing during the lease process and continues to be responsive and amazing. The grounds and facilities are keep! They so such an amazing job considering the number of people who live here. The maintenance people are AMAZING! It is so great that you can put a work order in at 8am and by the time you get home from work the issue is fixed,   Had a little trouble with my oven holding the temperature and they tried at first to troubleshoot but when it came down to it they replaced my oven!!!no hassle. So responsive! Huge shout out to Fernando and Rafa!!! They are amazing!
Definitely the best place in Seal Beach to live!!! Super happy with the Eaves Seal Beach<//review>< Pictures>

Sharing my motivation for my rating, upon request.

Overall the community is great, safe, clean and the management works well. There are nice amenities and the apartments have a practical layout and ample storage capacity. The appliances are not refined, but work well.

What I do not like in the apartment is some of the finishing. You can clearly see spots where it was painted or repainted. On more than one spot you see a difference in how reflective the surface is. The ceilings in both the seating/dining area and the main bedroom show that.  The kitchen cupboard doors are painted in a different white than the cupboards themselves. the paint on some shelves is peeling off and the doors are curving.
The shower units in the bathrooms are entirely of plastic and I am not a fan of the shower heads.  The floors throughout the flat are hard to clean either with vacuum or wet cleaning, dirt just seems to cling to it. The windows have single sheet glass and don't block much sound.
These are all things that just come with the apartment, and we accept that, but that does not give me a 5-star feeling.

Another element is the recent handling around Covid19 where a lot of the amenities were closed down.  We of course welcome the initiatives to keep us and everyone else safe, and Eaves did a great job there.  With the outdoor gym specifically however, several people have made all kinds of different requests and argumentation and they fell on deaf ears.  Eaves uses a (semi?) legal argument where all amenities are perks and tenants don't pay for them specifically. This likely to avoid giving a discount/rebate/waiver on the rent as compensation.  Whether that holds in legal terms, I don't know, but in general terms we select Eaves for what it offers as a whole: an apartment, safe location, parking space, swimming pool, outdoor gym, indoor gym, dog park, grills, study room, etc... etc... (there is a whole lot actually, very cool!) Since March, a lot of that was closed down for understandable reasons, and a lot is still not reopened.  I think it is reasonable to ask the outside gym to be opened, even if without equipment.  I also think it is reasonable to ask for some kind of financial compensation for not having the bulk of the amenities available since March.  Eaves thinks differently.  It gives me the feeling that we are not heard, and lose in any way we argue. That went into my evaluation as well.</Text>

<Text>I'm a little torn about these apartments. We loved the amenities. The gym and cross fit field are amazing. The hot tub is awesome. They just started a running club, which is also awesome.

But we were a little disappointed to find out that this was a smoking community when we moved in. Some units are smoking units by lease. We were stuck between heavy smokers. Which puts a damper on the nice SoCal evenings when you would like to open a window. This actually ends up being a huge quality of life issue. Who wants to be shut up indoors all the time?<//Text>< pictures>

So far, I'm loving this place. Obviously, with COVID-19 these are strange times, and the awesome amenities are temporarily closed, but overall this community is great. The apartment and common areas are nice, updated, and clean. Not to mention that the location is killer!

One really nice thing has been the staff here. Nicholas and Nicole were both incredibly helpful, professional, and pleasant with the processes to select an apartment, and to move-in. I was probably much more needy than most, and they were amazing.<//Text>

<Text>I would give negative stars if I could!!  This place is ONLY for people with small screaming kids and barking dogs!  We moved here because we had stayed here quite often for extended periods of time when it was Oakwood so we decided to sign a 10-month lease while relocating to So Cal. BIG MISTAKE!!  We have reported screaming kids and barking dogs to management on several occasions including one of the staff member's (Anne-Marie) constant barking dog.  Nothing was ever done about it after 10 months.  Regarding screaming kids, they told us there is nothing they can do about the out of control kids and that housing law forbids them to single them out.

Regarding barking dogs, management actually gave our downstairs neighbor permission to crate-train her new puppy, which yelps and barks the entire time it’s in the crate. . . several times a day!  Why would Management sacrifice our comfort and others for one dog is beyond me. We can hardly wait till our lease is up!!  In the meantime we will just have to turn our TV and music very loud everyday and wear ear plugs when we want some peace and quiet.

Only move here is you love constant screaming kids and barking dogs!!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80dd2fe13d66ea7d:0x693413149f39d1f7< /Gmap_id>< Resp>

I'm editing this comment because Google won't let me submit multiple reviews for one business.

We opened a service request today to unclog our dishwasher's air gap. Cesar came only about an hour after that. He not only unclogged the air gap, he found and fixed a leak we didn't know we had. My four stars to The Eaves still stands because of the parking but Cesar gets five stars.
==========
They could use more guest parking but that's my only criticism.  Our apartment is bright and sunny.  The grounds are well kept and a pleasure to view.

An apartment complex is only as good as its staff and that's the eaves Seal Beach's strong point.  The staffers are friendly.  The office staffers go out of their way to help whenever we ask for something.  Maintenance does its jobs quickly and well.</text><date>1627237792915</date>< Name>

<Review>I have an endless list of great experiences since living at EAVES SEAL BCH.  The maintenance team is top notch professionals & friendly.  I emailed service request & within an hour, Cesar arrived.  He was spot on with everything we needed.   Not only that, but the grounds here are immaculate & I’m quite certain staff is operating ABOVE CoVid guidelines.  (I’ve lived in dozens of apartments in my life & EAVES SEAL BCH property & staff  is far superior; and the rent is respectable.  Whatever I’m seeing on previous negative reviews must have been corrected because I’ve had only a positive experience.  Leasing & maintenance staff are doing a fantastic job in challenging times.<//Review>< pics>

Now tonight at 11:22 pm.  The room upstairs is walking very loud. And it's so late. I can't sleep. I already called the office twice, and still no solution. Before I moved into this unit. I used to live in C223. I've never had this kind of issue before. No problem at all. But now I'm living in room A211 the people upstairs stomp on the foot I heard three days in a roll.</review>

<review>The staff at Eaves Seal Beach is amazing! Everyone is super nice and they’re always going out of their way to help if you need it.

They’ve remodeled a lot of the buildings, apartments, pool area, etc. and it’s awesome! They’re still doing some construction, but it should be done soon. The new dog park is great for your pooch and the new outdoor gym by the tennis courts in incredible and has so many things you can do for your workout!

The whole complex is kept very well cleaned and you can’t beat the location - literally down the street from the beach AND Ballast Point Brewery. Can’t say anything bad about this place.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>Eaves is an an excellent apartment complex. Eaves is a beautiful place. I would rate this place a 10 with excellent customer service at the front desk to excellent handyman service. This week I had Richard and another handyman come and fix my studio. Their work was a 10 and they did their work fast. Both the Richard and the other handyman were professional and courteous.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

I've been living at this community for almost a year now. I want to express my gratitude to all the people who are working at this place. The management and the staff were always friendly and welcoming whenever I had a request or an issue to report. They were also fast to solve/fix the problem. All the facilities are in a perfect condition and are kept in this way by the staff of the community. The renovated apartments are high quality compared to the Californian standards in the same price range. I've been very happy with my neighbors too. I was expecting to hear some noise from my neighbors when I was moving in but my neighbors have been great, I didn't have a single noise complain during the whole year. Thank you so much for making the living at the community seamless and enjoyable!</review>

You won’t be happy after month two or three. Keep looking. This is not the place. It’s so many reasons to type so I won’t. Just don’t say you weren’t warned. However the issues I had with the place were inconveniences that I put rather highly. The staff was always great. Request were always filled on time. So if that’s important to you more than anything then you’re great.<//text>

Eaves really has a great staff. All have been attentive, friendly, and helpful. I adore my second floor corner apartment. The balcony overlooks a courtyard with beautiful plants below. It's quiet and clean. I feel safe and secure since it is a gated community. The only drawback is that I can't buzz visitors or delivery through the gate. I have to walk down to the gate to let them in. Small issue in an otherwise really lovely apartment community.<//Review>< Rating>

Eaves Seal Beach is one of the best apartment complexes I have lived in. The location can’t be beat.
The leasing office staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. Always there for you.
Complex grounds are always neat and tidy, grass is cut, trees trimmed, and flowers/plantings always in good shape.
It is like living in a vacation resort.
The maintenance staff is incredible.
They answer all my maintenance issues pretty much within one day. They are friendly, courteous, and do a good job. One time I sent in a request on Saturday and they came on Sunday and fixed the issue, fantastic.
About the only thing I would like to see is assigned parking. There is plenty of parking and I always find a place near my building, but having an assigned space would be easier when it comes to shopping or coming home late.
I would highly recommend living here, our experience has been wonderful.< /Text>

I am absolutely loving Eaves by Avalon in Seal Beach, CA. The process from start to finish was super easy and mainstream. There is an online application, and then an online move in checklist including where to get cable, renter insurance,  energy, etc. The facilities are very nice, and I have enjoyed the amenities immensely! A huge thank you and shout out to, Richard, who works in the office. He covered everything completely, and was very easy to work with!<//Review>

My wife and I lived there for a year in 2019. We complained multiple times about noise and nothing was done. After moving out, we were charged $1200 for "accelerated rent" and carpet replacement even though we opted to pay the $195 clean sweeping fee and paid our rent in full the day we moved out. The carpet was far from new when we moved in and our move in checklist even states that the carpet was not new. The office continues to try to charge us for brand new carpet on top of keeping our $650 dollar deposit. 0 stars if it would let me. DO NOT LIVE HERE.<//review>

After submitting the initial review of this location on my concerns regarding the construction, the management team immediately reached out and has worked with us on how to better our stay at this location. Huge thank you to Anne Marie who has consistently helped us be heard and receive customer service. With this recent customer service we are hoping the renovations can now be more bearable.

Thanks Eaves! Keep up the consistent communication.< /review><GmapID>0x80dd2fe13d66ea7d:0x693413149f39d1f7< /GmapID>< user_name>

Sticky door be gone! After some contractors had redone the apartment, the entry door would not open or close easily. Henry, from eaves Maintenance dropped by - shaved the door down on the sides and top; then repositioned the striker plate for the deadlock and now - I have to check to see the door is closed because the lock works to smoothly! Nice work. He also put in a new safety chain and painted where he had sanded, finally, used his vacuum to clean up the chips. Amazing.< /Review>

<text>Do not move here. It is utterly crime-infested. Every package that gets delivered also gets stolen. I started having things delivered to the front desk, but they were stolen there too. Cars are broken into, bike locks are cut, and the management does nothing. There is not a security camera to be found. The website looks nice, but do not be fooled like I was. Eaves Seal Beach?

< Review>
eaves Seal Beach is simply an awesome place to live.  The location is central to Irvine, OC beaches, Long Beach, LA county beach towns, downtown LA and area attractions.

The amenities are terrific.  Full gym, large pool, hot tubs, huge tennis area (complete with pro shop and attending pro), sand volleyball courts ... even a dry cleaner.

Equally as important, the staff here are tremendous.  Management, front desk, sales and maintenance staff are courteous, responsive, friendly and knowledgeable.  On a consistent basis, fellow residents comment to same amongst each other.

I highly recommend eaves Seal Beach.  No plans of moving any time soon.

<Review>Fantastic Place to Live!
My family and I love this place. The residents professionals are friendly, attentive and dedicated here at the Eaves. Seal Beach is a great place to live and your pets are also welcome. When I have a problem the staff is attentive to my needs. If there is a problem with my apartment I send in a request to get it fixed and it gets fixed sometimes within the same hour and/or at the latest the same day! The staff around the property make you feel safe and are attentive to the Eaves residents as well. The amenities are great! The Tennis Pro is wonderful and has great individual and group lessons for everyone. My kids love the group lessons he conducts in the summer. It is nice to have a Professional Tennis Pro on property. Eaves Management is always looking for new ways to make Eaves Residents happy. Oh how can I forget!! Eaves has a Taco Cart come every Friday (yummy) and a variety of Food Trucks every Tuesday throughout the year! We are spoiled and most definitely live in a Resort!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

From the moment I stepped in the doors looking to apply for an apartment the staff was so helpful and accommodating. They made sure to give me the best bang for my buck and I felt like I was being treated like family. Since moving in I have had no problems with my apartment but if anything small has come up it has been fixed within 15 minutes. They work hard to make the complex feel like a community and I appreciate all the extra amenities the complex offers.< /Text>

David responded immediately at 8am. I had to request  the repair be done at 2pm  because I  did not know no one was going to be home to put the dogs in the bedroom until after I made the service request. He accommodated the time request and fixed the drawer right at 2pm very quickly.< /text>

The words: “We are going to begin the remodel of your apartment,” struck terror in our hearts!

Fortunately for us, Erika Sandoval, Eaves Resident Service Coordinator, made herself available along with the notice.

She met with us in our home prior to the event and patiently answered all of our questions and concerns.

With Erika's experience and expertise, she provided helpful suggestions and solutions for our particular needs regarding the remodel.

During the process, she continued to make herself available, likened to a “Life Coach”.

Erika made challenging circumstances much more tolerable.  We are very grateful for her help!

Most definitely make sure parking pass doesn't fall off your rear view mirror,  they  will tow your faster than you can say " I should have stayed at a Holiday Inn Express". Now I'm out $212.00, how about a warning first being I was clearly driving a rental car. Then a property manager yelled at My kid for bouncing a basketball in the play ground. Not ever staying here again. Oakwood sucks!</Text>

<text>When I moved in 4 months ago, I thought this place was great. I wish they told me the would be major construction in my building before I signed the lease. There are many days in a row that we have no water for 8 hours. We weren't able to come in and out of the apartment for a whole day, plus more days coming soon. They will be doing construction in our kitchen and bathroom for 2 weeks or more. Management doesn't want to compensate anyone for these inconveniences. Why should I pay full rent if I don't have access to basic amenities? Also, how much will my rent increase with these upgrades I don't need?< /text><Date>1530551496232</Date><Name>Ricky Wood< /Name>< GmapID>

I interacted with MARIA SALAZAR yesterday as she came to clean my wndows (dirty from power washing) She was very professional and pleasant.  She was properly attired and had a big smile.  She volunteered how much she apprecited her job and how pleasant it is to work at EAVES
The wndows are sparkling and I am happy to see through them again.
ROBERTO came to repair my drawers in the kitchen.  He was very bussiness like ,  arrived with proper equipment and replacements,  careful with my possessions and asked if there was anything else he could assist me with.  A very good employee</Review>

My husband and I looked at a lot of different options when we needed to move and chose Eaves.  We have two dogs so it can be difficult to find a place that will take them. Eaves does and actually caters to the four legged friends.  Just about everyone in here has a dog and it is cool.  Yes, there is some barking but not during the night.  It is actually a quiet place.  The staff make you really feel at home and show a genuine interest.  Take a look at Eaves; it is worth it.</Review>

If you enjoy the constant screaming of children then this place is for you! Not possible to even use the pool for loud, splashing children. And the hot tub is treated like a kiddie pool for babies and toddlers. The apartments are extremely out of date and have a rather strange lay-out. Also, they rent some apartments by the night like a motel 8, which leads to a lack of respect for the actual lease holders.< /text>

Nice buildings, great amenities. Could use a little updating (like double pane windows). They do not offer recycling! Also, beware of your deposit. After I left, they kept my deposit, the pet deposit and said I owe them more money. The apartment had no damage when I left, my dog stayed mainly on the balcony. Now I have a collection agency calling me and I'm still waiting for my money back.<//text>

Dogs barking all night. Poop and pee in the pool. Cars stolen. 2 burned cars in the parking lot for weeks. Place is run like a hotel. Tow truck scam with security guard. Identity theft from the trash can. Some parts of the facility are filthy.  Noisy, noisy, noisy. Don't leave valuables in your car. Street people live in the bushes like animals.  My friend had a rat in his ceiling. And a black widow in his heater. Termite droppings in his  food storage areas. Dust everyday from the oilfields on and in everything.
I didn't want to visit, I felt sorry for him.  I would not live there. Police are there all the time. They even come into your apartment. looking.  For what?  Drugs?  Not a happy place.<//review>

This place ruined my life. If I could give it negative 5 Stars I would.

On Nov. 9th, they flooded the apartment above me, which damaged the ceiling and sent water into my apartment. I knew there was asbestos in the popcorn ceiling and the pipes, and they spent five days telling me that  "Everything was fine," as they brought in blowers and blew asbestos all over my children and everything we own.

They then refused to contain it and clean it up correctly, and when AQMD got involved, they refused to offer me another place to stay after AQMD sealed off my apartment for entrance and inhabitability, even though they have Oakwood furnished units right on the premises.

My three children and I have now been homeless for over a month, with my items held hostage by eaves.

Jason Meneses, the manager, has refused to offer me anywhere else to stay since November 12th, or pay for alternative accommodations for us, which is the LAW, and doesn't care that I'm living in my car with my three children for the holidays.

I'm considering legal action against Eaves Seal Beach.

They do not care about their residents, the water has been shut off at least twice a month, every month that I've been here since April, everything is broken and worn down, there's constant construction, and now the long-term health of my children has been put in jeopardy by eaves blatant negligence.

Do not be another victim. Stay away from this dump.<//review>

<text>The FIRST buffet in over a year and all I can say is every bite lead my senses in another wonderful direction that I wished would never end. Only at a buffet can you tease your taste buds and the New China Restaurant will do just that. Enjoy.< /text>< Pics>

The ToGo plates aren't the best. You cant serve yourself and they only allow a certain amount of items per container so you cant get a little bit of everything. Food is good though.</text>

We love going to New China for the crab legs and shrimp buffet. The food is consistently fresh and hot. The selection is typical of Chinese buffets but they offer a variety of seafood options. They have a nice seating area that is small but not cluttered.< /Review>

i went there with my family  for lunch  the lady gave me dirty looks and demanded to know my children ages we had to clean our own table and dump our own food.not to mention the $72 for 2 parents😡  2kids .will never eat here again< /review>
<Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1601179430518, 'text': "Sorry you had a bad experience. I would like to clarify a few of your issues. We have children's price and adult price for Buffet so we do have to ask children's ages. 10 year olds are considered full price. We ask that you place your plates in the bucket only if you will be coming back inside for more food. We do not ask you to clean your  own table. If your ticket came out to $72 it was because your 2kids were over 10yrs old and you had refills at $1 each on your 32oz drinks which is posted along with the price of the Buffet when you come in."}<//Response><gmapID>0x80eab869939cb943:0x9d24d52fd62c8fdd<//gmapID></record>

All the food I have chose to eat has always been well prepared, well flavored, and I didn't have to wait for a refil of any dish. The waitresses are kind, and respectful. Not overbearing but not too distant either. They kept my table clear, and drinks full. The atmosphere is calm, and welcoming. I definitely refer this location to friends and family.< /review>< Date>

The amount of food is very low considering the fact that it’s a buffet, and the food isn’t even good, like at all. Pretty good service though, very nice people.< /text>

<review>I like to come here every now and then.
Been coming here since I was in high school and oh boy is that a long time.
The staff is  nice and friendly.
They have a big selection of different items to choose from.
They also have different fruits and items for salads.
Place is easy to notice from the street right on the corner.
Parking lot is large and they have several handicap spots right out front.
I do not think that the ratings on this place are fair or accurate.

The Manager didn't seem to know the meaning of making the customer happy. I don't eat at buffets anymore since having surgery, but went to spend time with family. She didn't allow me to order a combo and eat with them 🤷🏻‍♂️</text>

< review>
Food is good for such a small restaurant. But the staff not friendly at all, my kid was walking towards our table and one of the ladies that works there tried to grab him and made him feel down (She didn't try to pick him up). When she turn around to see if I was looking. She made us look like if it was our fault what had just happened.
First and last time going there👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻</review>

Went with my mother about 3pm, the food was all dried looking and not the best.  At check out I asked the cashier why she was charging dinner fee she states dinner starts at 330 pm. I mentioned the food being dried and how it had been sitting out too long. That is wasn't fresh. She replied rudely "you still at the food right?" I stated if price was changing at a certain time they should also change the food and make it fresh.  Never going back.<//Text>

I asked for strawberry lemonade and when I tasted it , it tasted nothing like it and tasted like soda. Food tasted good until I got sick. Plates do not look well washed , they look dirty. Ended up going to ER because of I kept throwing up after I ate this food. Never going back.<//Text>

<text>Hello and thank you for looking us up. I have worked for this restaurant 18yrs and I feel I should clarify some of these reviews. 1st,in responds to Jenifer H Flores her review is nothing but hate,rumors and racism! Another review that I would like to clear up is about us enforcing you finish ALL your food or we will charge extra. We seldom ever do that and that only applies to excessive amounts of food left over. Our service is always friendly and if you ever feel a food item isn't fresh let us know and WE WILL CHANGE IT RIGHT AWAY! Please understand it gets slow sometimes and the vegetables wilt faster when customers aren't stirring the food.</text></record>

<text>This place is GARBAGE. besides the fact that I know how dirty their work conditions are from the spoiled meat to the cockroaches in the drink dispenser. The owner is very rude and believe me the food isnt good and definitely not worth it.</text><user_name>Savannah Fuller</user_name>< gmapID>

<Text>Walked in, was greeted with nothing but rude, disgusted, unappreciated faces. I stood by the door with my mates for quite a while waiting to be offered a seat, eventually I was acknowledged by a waitress, I spoke to her but she didn't seem to understand, so we took our seats without guidance. The food was decent, several different variations of chicken, rice, chicken and more chicken. After feasting on the somewhat delicious meal we asked our waiter for the bill, she seemed confused and replied "I don't understand " , it was then I realized her confusion as I remembered I'm a raccoon.<//Text>< pics>

Its one of the only few buffets here in Porterville. But they really enforce the rule of finish everything on the plate. So if it doesnt taste to your liking and you dont finish it theyll get on to your case like you are a child. They will be sure to let you know that there prices will go up because of you not finishing your plate and not because their prices are prepared for a buffet style restaurant.< /review>

<Review>The dishes are always dirty. I find either food or gum at the bottom of the plates. It is gross. The boss lady is always rude. Most times I hear her either rude to customers or yelling at employees.< /Review>< pictures>

< Review>
Staff is not friendly, food is dried, first thing I smelled while walking in was wet cats. I wonder if this is the restaurant that Health Dept found those frozen dead cats in freezers... never coming again. Went in for lunch ,walked out paying dinner prices at 3:40. I asked the the girl behind register why the dinner prices if we came in for lunch. She said, " Afta tree tirty dinah pices"... would not recommend it.< /Review>

This place too old!!!  Dishes, bathroom, decor, and building looked very old and outdated. As we began to eat their dishes looked like they weren't being scrubbed correctly. The food also looked as if they had used it from the day before, to be used for the next day. Not good. Since we were in the city doing other errands we decised to give it a try. Sorry we will not be cisiting again.
Also the food was very bland , potatoes tasted like they were made from powder.< /Review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>I love eating crab legs. For this you need "crab crakers" to open some of the legs. They did not have any. Tried eating them with out this tool but they were still frozen. Explained this to the waitress and she stated, "Everybody ate them like this."  Some of the food was warm not HOT. The Orange chicken was chewy and not crunchy like other places. Salted crab was cold and tasted funny. In conclusion, I belive they let the food "sit" for too long. We were there for over one hour, nobody steped out to check the temperature on the food. P. S. We mentioned to one of the waitreses that the food was warm and not hot. I requested to speak to the manager, not available.

Bad service and I give it a thumbs down cause if you are waiting to get served they will go to the customer behind you and before I left I told the lady that this is the last time I will go there so they get a big thumbs down< /review>

(Translated by Google) In terms of cleanliness I give it 3 stars it looks clean in terms of food 2 stars it lacks variety, some very salty meats very dry desserts since several days ago it was not much to my liking I think I will not return

< Review>
Place to find several tools for baking including food colours, essences, cake bases, moulds, spatulas for cake decoration, and moulds to make cookies and candies. There can be more cake toppers for ceremonies other than birthday. I would say this is a customer friendly place with great staff and good collection on baking and decorating tools.< /Review>

<Review>Its a good place to have if you suddenly realize you dont have a certain item and need it asap but its SO overpriced. La Bodega in San Ysidro is my go-to place for supplies but its nice to have standless a little closer to home for emergencies.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I was looking for supplies to make my daughter's unicorn birthday cake and was shown multiple options and helped to make decisions that fit my budget. They have everything from cake pans to chocolate molds to premade, colored buttercream. Highly recommended!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

It's a great place to buy your baking supplies! I have been coming to Standlees for years and I never go any where else unless they don't have what I need but that's hardly ever. Thank you guys for making me feel like family when I shop there and for always having the best quality baking supplies!!!</review>

<text>This place was awesome! I was making last minute cookies for a gathering I had and I was trying to find Decorating gel to decorate my cookies; they had what I wanted and more~! I would recommend this shop to a lot of people, especially to the more savvy baker. This place has a ton of stuff that I would love to buy once I get some cash.< /text><resp>None</resp>< pictures>

Nice store with a good amount of stuff. I used to be a regular at Do it with Icing and miss that place. This place is easily twice as expensive. Got the chocolate Bavarian cream for cake filling..BIG mistake! It's gross! Won't be coming to this place as often seeing as they closely match amazon prices. Oh and btw you have to pay for parking.<//review>

Great variety of baking/bakery items, but the prices are a little high.  Standlee's has a huge choice of chocolate molds, cake/cupcake toppers, cookie cutters, as well as pre-made fondant, edible glitter and sprinkles, cake/cupcake packaging including bakery boxes.  If you own a food business, you may qualify for a business discount.  Mention it.  They have been in business for many years, but their staff are not as sugary sweet as you'd expect.  They mean business and want to help.  This is a great place to shop for last-minute items, but know that you'll pay boutique prices.< /text>

I had to take my wife there to buy some chocolate molds. She's been going there for awhile. I cook and bake as well and I was absolutely overwhelmed by their inventory.  And they have EVERYTHING one could need for any confections or cakes.  I ended up buying things that I didn't know I needed.  And the staff was not only very knowledgeable, but very nice.  Excellent customer service.  Thank you.<//review>

Very poor management. They gave me an assignment for Pick n Pull in Rancho Cordova and it was horrible because I had a co worker who bullies and discriminated me because Of my gender but Randstad didn’t do anything about and they just told me they’ll take care of it when they bullying and discrimination still continued. I understand the staffing agency thing and directly employed but we are still employees which we should be be protected from these type of things. I will never recommend this company and Pick and Pull.</review>

Moved to the city needed a job on short notice   , walked in and signed up with the agency went on with my day next thing I know my recruiter calls 2 days later with a job. Turns out a spot opened up and she recalled my situation and offered me the position. The staff is nice, attentive, and are looking to put you to work. They operate like a professional sport team, constant communication between agents, the head of the office is present and keeping things moving.

If your looking for work, I recommend this branch.  Go see what they can do for you.<//Review>

<review>I was referred to this agency. During the interview process I really believed that I had found an agency that would find me a assignment that could be long term, one that would offer consistency and job security.
Ultimately, it was smoke and mirrors. I was given an assignment on the spot. Worked for a month then the assignment ended. Begun another assignment only for that job to end within two weeks.< /review>< pics>

They mainly only have warehouse jobs available for work, which is okay because a job is a job in my opinion. But after you're hired you are on your own. They find you a temporary job very quickly after being hired & once that initial job ends you will never speak to anyone in the office again unless you physically go to the main office. If u think I'm kidding try to call right now, you can call 20 times in a row, noo answer. You can get hurt at work, go to the wrong work site address or simply really need to speak with a manager you will be ON YOUR OWN. no hours. They suck. 😢</review><time>1547246223934</time><Name>Gypsy Missy< /Name><GmapID>0x809ad12c7d5599c9:0x6bbfa15368782bee</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Reason for my 2 stars. I got hired on with the company through Ranstad. Quit due to illness. Looking for work with Ranstad after the illness and they said they will not work with me because I quit the previous one.
Seriously they hired me on and how quitting that company have to do with not working with me. Frustrated they have this. They was the one blowing up my cell phone because I was the only one came close with experiences to match their client need. Call them BS.<//text>

this is a review from my very pleasant and helpful experience at randstad.
This the 20th day of march 2019, I had the pleasure to meet Diane  at the Downtown Sacramento office. I was given a very warm welcome when I enterred the front door whichput me at ease to say the least.
she walked me throught the steps and assisted me in completing all i needed to do.< /review>

<Review>Been going here for years for breakfast. Finally went for lunch and it was delicious. The Lobster BLT was SO good—it came with good chunks of sweet claw and the bacon was so good with it. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was super good as well. Can’t wait to try dinner next! The service here is always great, staff are super sweet.<//Review>< Pictures>

Food was excellent! Fresh ingredients and nice presentation.. Service was very good. Right on the edge of the beach so the view of the ocean was great. Validation for parking next door was a good thing since there was little to no street parking within a reasonable distance. Will definitely be back.</text>

The food was honestly the best. I asked for water and never got it. We checked in in swim suits because it is right on the beach as we went for our table that is when they informed us that the swim suits were not good in the restaurant. I just didn't care for the way we were informed as she asked my companion if I had a shirt vs asking me.< /text>

Always a great place for food at the beach. Great food, fun atmosphere, and perfect for meeting up for a meal and drink anytime of day. And if you are a people watcher, perfect views of the beach and boardwalk.</text>

Fantastic as always...Given the current state of things the spacing was more than adequate...all tables more than 6ft from the next table.  As usual for the Seafood lover that I am, the selection was phenomenal from all sections of the menu. The clams in white wine & butter sauce was beyond savory and to die for. There is lighter faire in the Casual Pates section.  Drinks were spot on and paired well with my food. This is a great spot to sip a libation and watch the sunset.< /Text>

We had a great dinner and had the nicest server Chris. He loves his job and it shows. He couldn’t have been nicer. I also had the opportunity to meet Nick the manger, and he was so personable. Thank you Chris and Nick for making our trip to San Diego even nicer. I wish everyone loved their job as much as you seem to.< /Review>

This place does great food. We came during coronavirus, so there was no seating, but we were staying close by at the Catamaran resort. I got the Fish and chips, Mrs P got the seafood taco trio. Winners for both of us. I think it would have been even better if they were seating, as my fish was soggy on the bottom, but still amazing. I had a bite of the tacos too. Amazing food, really amazing. I highly recommend this place.<//Review>

< Review>
We did not have a good experience here. We were served moldy fruit with our breakfast. The waitress offered a replacement food item but we did not want to eat anything else from this restaurant. Coffee was served cold and the food we did eat was expensive and not good tasting. I do not recommend eating here. Spend your money elsewhere.</Review>

<review>The food was great! Their famous burger live up to the hype the beef patty was juicy and flavorful, the buns was rly good, I would also  recommend trying  the burrito carne asada! Gave it a 4 star coz the jumbo shrimp wasnt so jumbo more of like a medium size!  only give you 4pcs!< /review><gmapID>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe< /gmapID>< Rate>

As usual for the Seafood lover that I am, the selection was phenomenal from all sections of the menu. The clams in white wine & butter sauce was beyond savory and to die for. There is lighter faire in the Casual Pates section.  Drinks were spot on and paired well with my food. This is a great spot to sip a libation and watch the sunset.< /Review><response>None<//response>< rate>

Always a great place for food at the beach. Great food, fun atmosphere, and perfect for meeting up for a meal and drink anytime of day. And if you are a people watcher, perfect views of the beach and boardwalk.< /review>

Always delicious. I had the clam chowder with large bites of clams and the lobster salad. I am not a fan of dressing so i opted for oil and balsamic vinegar, was it AMAZING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</Text>

<username>Dave Kitchens</username><rate>5</rate><text>This was the best breakfast I've had in some time.

I had the Steak and Lobster Benedict, both were cooked perfectly and on top of a lightly toasted focaccia.

The potatoes and asparagus were also done well and it was a great meal altogether.

Service was outstanding and the views were just over the top.

Highly recommend<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGO3MQddkli8yRKex-Q4C4ggfihNeoWwQ6oB6E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< user_id>

<Review>The best service directly on Pacific Beach! We spent many evenings here overlooking the beach and relaxing with great food and drinks. A big shout out to Dominic and Chris and the entire staff for taking care of us over a very relaxing week! Highly recommend.< /Review>< gmapID>

<text>I used to frequent this business regularly and the food isn't bad. My issue with this business is the lack of employee diversity. I've seen a couple of African American men clearing tables regularly, but rarely any servers or hostesses.  Hire more people of all nationalities! Your staff should reflect the community.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

The patio dining offers great views of the boardwalk, the beach, and the ocean.  I had a delightful cocktail while we waited for lunch, The Drunken Mermaid - just the right amount of zip.  We had the Poke Tacos as an appetizer, they were very good, nice flavors.  However, our lunch entrees were just mediocre.  I had the fish and chips, the fish portion tasted fresh from the freezer, yet the French fries were tasty.  My husband ordered the fish tacos and described them as "very average."

I would, however, re-visit World Famous to enjoy the views, the Drunken Mermaid, and the Poke Tacos!<//text>

<Date>1536177898762</Date><rate>3< /rate><Review>On my recent trip to San Diego, we ate at this location 3 different times. Not because we actually liked it because it was convenient to the party of people we were traveling with. The food was good but not great. Heavy on the butter, salt and/or oil. Anything that had sauce in it was over sauced. Prices were a little higher than I would have normally liked to pay for the quality of food.

What really make this place worthwhile is the view. Definitely check the sunset times and time your dinner accordingly. You can definitely get an awesome sunset from just about anywhere you sit. They do have a covered and heated patio, the music isn't overly loud making conversation easy.

For large parties of 5 or more, I definitely recommend making reservations for holidays and weekends.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFXd-x6GTwu6d3qO_r91t4b_bfPHvOjpeYCQqK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHLenAHzyRHjwIfSIRi1Zw3f0J33tYLhJ4MIF_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhmlhGlper8gqiSW-F4HvyZuT1sYN276m1o9j-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSBb-6RvdgyHy1-hGMJ4oXTrXw-sSmczM9-p_n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

I’ve been coming to this restaurant with my family since I was a child and the food and service has always been great but I’m writing this review based on a unsatisfactory experience I had dining at World Famous over the weekend. My husband, our daughters, and my parents came in for dinner and we split the bill. When the server came to bring our card back, my husband’s debit card was missing from the folder. The card had been ran but only the receipts were in there. We told our server who claimed she put the debit card back in there. We stayed around for a while hoping the card would be recovered but it was not. Someone came to our table (maybe the manager?) to get my husband’s information saying she would flip the tables and look for the card after closing. We never even got a call back that night to follow up on this situation. Since we were staying in a neighboring hotel, the next morning we stopped in to see if there were any updates. We were basically just brushed off saying “oh yeah, you know the server said she put it in the folder and it must have fallen out.” This situation has been very inconvenient. We were leaving town the next day and were planning to use that card to buy gas for the trip home. Someone obviously picked up the card because there was a charge in California sending money to someone over Facebook pay, that was not us. I think it was very unprofessional and disappointing that no one ever followed up with us about this situation and the way it was handled.<//text>

<Review>The food is wonderful. We had the Khalua Hash and the Seafood Omelet both were delicious.  Seating is outside on their patio with an ocean view. It is our new stop for breakfast when we visit San Diego.< /Review>< time>

The food here is always amazing. Lobster BLT is incredible. Sat at the bar. Service from the bartender could of been better. He didn't once check back on us after our food came out, but the rest of the staff made up for it.<//text>

The name of this place is a hint to it's amazing food and staff  - World Famous! To any visitors stopping in San Diego,  you've got to trek on over to Pacific Beach and give them a try.  Fresh lobster tacos,  salad,  fish and more  - we didn't want to leave.  Those lobster tacos I could eat plenty.  They will validate your parking so don't let that deter you.  Just park in the garage adjacent to restaurant. Tell them @eyesofthepeople sent you.<//review>

2nd Honeymoon after 22 years of marriage, we wanted a dinner on the beach, and weren't disappointed!  We went around 6pm, and only had to wait 30 minutes, and got a table right next to the window. Service was great, views were spectacular and it was a great experience and memory for us!  Husband ordered a shrimp dish, and I ordered a chicken/pasta/spinach dish, and they were both very good tasting! Overall, very pleased!</Review>

Drinks are good and there are a wide variety of cocktails. Best part is the fact that its on the beach and there are a lot of people watching opportunities. The lobster bisque was amazing and same with the tuna dish. Only negative was that the coconut shrimp and vegetables were a little too soggy with oil.< /review>

< Review>
Ate there twice, one dinner, one breakfast. Both were very good. Building old, and at this time, all food is outside. We had tables overlooking the ocean both times. Menu semi-limited, but a good variety. Will definitely eat there again.</Review>

<review>The food and the view was amazing but the service wasn't the best. I can't actually say that about the service as a whole, it was just our server. She took our order and then she blew past us the rest of the time. We had to track her down to even get our bill. Everyone else in the restaurant was great, it was just unfortunate that our server had to be like that...</review>< Response>

This was the best breakfast I've had in some time.

I had the Steak and Lobster Benedict, both were cooked perfectly and on top of a lightly toasted focaccia.

The potatoes and asparagus were also done well and it was a great meal altogether.

Service was outstanding and the views were just over the top.

Highly recommend<//Text>

<text>As a professional cook I am very critical about where the wife and I eat, often resulting in delivery pizza or drive thru options. I had the sea bass, very good. She had the scallops, they were decent. Scallops were cooked well, just not the best flavor profile in my humblest of opinions. Niece had the filet with lobster add on, all great. Server was awesome and attentive and made sure to take extra caution with my niece's treenut allergy. Would most definitely return if ever in the area again.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOigx1_PRZRlpP-1G2xR2JW4jNL_9H6xEUuNgim=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGKsSUp2ndt7Y8kYPGNpEjBv4UQhhyXKj4WWUG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe< /gmapID></record>

<review>I'm so sorry to say poor World Famous has definitely declined over the years. It used to be quite a quote-unquote fancy restaurant with excellent meals and manners.  The breakfast I had about noon was poorly made very poorly presented with the deadest left of lettuce I've ever been served. The waitress was okay. And the Kahlua Coffee was very good. I guess at least they can still make decent drinks. The location however is A #1 plus!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Good food. Good view. Service was great. Tap beers were warm. And the menu is limited due to covid 19. But other than that we enjoyed ourselves. Graham was our server and he did the best he could even though he was new. I would go again.<//text>

<text>The food, service, and view are great! Had the prime rib omelette and the lobster omelette and both were great! We ate there twice while there and weren’t disappointed either time! Staff was super friendly and helpful as to food ideas. Try the spicy bloody Mary’s, you won’t be disappointed!< /text><response>None< /response>< UserId.>

<Review>Lobster bisque. My sister-in-law once chose the lobster bisque as her last meal, should she ever end up on death row. I can't argue her choice. It's thick, robust, and full of bites of tasty lobster meat. Order it as a side to your entree, or snack light elsewhere and enjoy the bisque on its own.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

There was was some wait on a Wednesday night but it was worth it. I went on a company outing and boy did I enjoy my meal and the brews. Starting with the mussels and the calamari, everything tasted great.  My friends and I decided to order a little of everything and we had no complaints. From the salads , to the lobster bisque, to the filets with scallops, to the lobster tacos, to the lobster tails, this place is great and not overpriced. It’s was about 140 for 4 and we ate like kings.<//Text>

And for me there Lobster Bisque is great, lobster salad rocks,  as does fresh fish entrees.
Turkey Brie Sandwich a total let down sucked the Turkey needs to be fresh roasted..
Always amazing service.  Come chill enjoy your stay..</text>< Pictures>

I ordered the crab cakes without the curly hair and got the hair any way. The view is great . Also I ordered potato wrapped

It might be world famous, but the question is for what? I spent over 15 minutes waiting for a table which is fine it shows this place must be good  or people are sunset starved. . I’ll never know. We were seated  at a filthy table that had not been wiped down. I Asked loudly to five waitress walking by, hey could you wipe down our table? We were obviously ignored. After another 15 minutes of not acknowledged we just went to the hostess who was chatting with four waitresses and said we are receiving zero and horrible service. We are out of here. She didn’t blink and eye or care. Makes me think this is the standard for this place. Don’t go! Go to any other oceanfront restaurant. I promise you I’ve saved you an hour of your time. You’re welcome.</Text>

<review>Great breakfast overlooking the beach! A little too windy for the patio, but still great views. The food was slow, but understandable as a very large party had ordered just before us. It was worth the wait however.</review>< pictures>

<Review>We stopped in for lunch, as a group we ordered beer battered fish and chips, lobster BLT, calamari and the clam chowder. All of it was so good! The lobster BLT is a cold sandwich with huge chunks of lobster and 4 slices of bacon on top of "the fixings". The fish and chips were cooked to perfection and served with a dill tartar sauce that was amazing. The clam chowder was also perfect!

Second Time here. First time about 1.5 years ago.  We arrived Mon Jan 30 about 2pm.  It wasn't too busy. They gave us an inside beach side table right away. A beautiful sunny clear day. probably about 70 degrees outside with no wind.

The five of us ordered 6 main dishes, 1 soup and and appetizer.  All were very very tasty.  The lobster bisque was hot, full body and tasty.  A good choice, not watery or thin.

Favorite appetizer (starter), hands down is Nut Crusted Brie
with mango chipotle glaze.  The Mango chipotle glaze was a big hit. Just enough spice to give you a pleasing pop for your taste buds, and you actually enjoyed the sweet taste of mango to contrast the Chipotle spice.  Could have just eaten the brie as a main meal.

We ordered the Crabcake Sliders as additional appetizer for our table… It was three dungeness crab cakes(each crab cake about the size of a swedish meat ball)  served in fresh baked brioche mini buns, sliced tomato, green leaf lettuce, thin red onion and house made caper tartar sauce with a side of crisp seasoned fries

The seasoned French fries came with 3 of our dishes.....really good fries, we think they were coated with a panko bread crumbs,  made them crispy, crunchy and irresistibly good.

I ordered the Sierra Mar Grilled Sea Bass prepared char grilled cold water seabass served over fresh avocado, roma tomato, bermuda onion, timbale drizzled with white balsamic dijon chive vinaigrette.  I was looking  for a non land meat dish, and this hit the spot.  If you like fish, you'll like this.

Fish and Chips, nice golden brown breading, and hit the spot with my friend.  They are Beer Batter Fish And Chips...cold water white icelandic cod fried in World Famous' micro brew beer batter served
with crispy fries and homemade tartar sauce

Poke tacos, a bit of a twist from how Hawaiian poke is served. It's made with fresh ahi tuna marinated hawaiian poke style, served in three crispy wonton taco skins over guacamole, ginger wasabi drizzle & sesame seeds.

If you like angel hair pasta and clam sauce, try World Famous' version: Capellini California, it's angel hair pasta tossed in a light clam garlic olive oil sauce with roma and sun dried tomato, fresh basil, spinach, asparagus, greek olives & grated parmesan cheese.

Lastly, Prime Rib Baguette thinly carved prime rib served in a french baguette with balsamic dressing, horseradish sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions and jack cheese.

Everything was delish, served quickly, hot and tasty.  Having our lunch at beach side on a sunny day is a plus plus.

This is a place we will definitely return to when we can.  We like the food and service a couple years ago, and we liked it this time.  Consistent it is!!.< /Text>

Nice restaurant on the beach with ocean views from almost every seat. Great food and friendly staff.

The breakfast options are everything from omelets to eggs and bacon to breakfast burritos and pancakes. Breakfast here is solid.

Lunch offers everything from sandwiches to burgers to lobster to soup and everything in between. I love the Baja Chicken Sandwich.

There are definitely more delicious places in San Diego to eat but if you want a nice meal with ocean views, it doesn’t get better than World Famous.< /Review>

It wasn't that busy for a Friday night. We waited a bit for service. Our waiter was excellent! He was very helpful and guided us through the menu very well. The food was expensive, and just not that great. It was good, but not $50 for a 2 course good. All in all, friendly service, pretty food, fancy stuff, average taste.<//review>

Excited for our evening even though we didn't know what to expect, we couldn't have found a better place. Our seafood was outstanding and the atmosphere could not have been more perfect. Trust me. Call and make a reservation and then enjoy the best night you could imagine in San Diego.< /review><userid>114008068640493570584</userid>< Pics>

<Time>1554182818540</Time><Review>We have walked past the World Famous dozens of times but haven't eaten there in years.  We made a reservation for about an hour before sunset for a table against the glass.  The view of the sunset was wonderful and the entertainment provided by the Boardwalk passerby's was also a treat.  The service was very good very good and when I asked about where the tuna was from in the seared ahi tuna salad, she said she could check, but thought I would enjoy one of the other salads more.
I ordered the shrimp salad and it was delicious.  I ran into a friend that had eaten the seared ahi tuna the next night, and he confirmed I'd made a good choice.</Review>< Response>

<review>Went to World Famous for breakfast on a weekday and it was a great time to go, the likelihood of finding nearby parking is much greater. It is located right by the beach so we took advantage and got a table in their terrace which was nice and toasty thanks to their heaters,  it's an enclosed area yet still outside. The service was very good with many servers checking our coffee and often just seeing if we needed anything.  Our main server was delightful,  she had a very positive and outgoing attitude. The food came fast once we ordered and I was happy to find vegetarian options.  I had the veggie hash which was very tasty. It was overall a great experience,  food, service and location were great!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

We waited over 15 minutes to get service, we asked the waitress more than 4 times for certain things and never received anything, I had to walk to the back and get my own box, own straws, and condiments that we asked for. The man handing out the food was awesome and actually helped us out. We also asked to get the heater on several times and finally the man handing out the food did it so we tipped him. Our waitress was just socializing with her co workers the entire time. The service use to be amazing but it has gone completely downhill. Save your time and go somewhere else!</Text>

Happy hour has changed but one would ever know. The snippy waitress told us but there were no happy hour menus and the website has not been changed. This was 3 weeks ago, so I called them and asked about happy hour and they said it was changed but no one has changed their website STILL! Why change the happy hour after it has been the same all of this time and not even mention the changes on the website.< /Text>

Delicious food and wonderful vibes. The customer service was amazing to us as well. The views of the ocean are incredible from here. My girlfriend always talks about the ahi tacos and has tried finding ahi tacos as good as this place and she can’t find them anywhere as good< /Text>

<Review>So visiting San Diego for the first time and this place came highly recommended for the fish tacos. Unfortunately they were no longer serving the tacos when we arrived (I think it's a happy hour thing). However, we ended up ordering these bacon and puff pastry wrapped asparagus things for appetizers which were fantastic. Then I ordered the cioppino for my meal.... OMG. Literally mind blown. Best dish of my entire trip and I would move to San Diego just to eat it regularly. The broth was flavorful and rich and there was a ton of delicious seafood. Plus some tasty bread to soak up some of the broth.  Do recommend!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcWie8vTCjSlEG9E4j-98EaYUhgLQ2Pf2qIMY0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlPegdu-Dmn4LMgILAAvAjGrJXFA70VfCOZ_qL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

5 of us had breakfast there today & it was EXCELLENT. It was pretty busy in there but service was still reasonably quick & the food was better than any other restaurants we had on this trip. The potato’s are so tasty & crispy, eggs were made to order perfectly, & pancakes were good also. Bloody Mary’s were just basic though.< /Review>

Stopped in post-sunset for a Ruby Red and $3 Taco Tuesday seafood tacos. I always love the Ruby Red cocktail - delicious, fresh, big glass, only need one. First time having seafood tacos there - WORTH the $3/each! We had shrimp, fish and lobster. I could do without the lobster but highly recommend the fish. I'm not a battered fish girl for fish tacos but the batter was light and perfect and the piece of fish VERY generous! Had a bowl of clam chowder as well. Good but a tad pricey for the small portion (about a cup). Head out to see sunset if you get there early, or stop in for a post-sunset drink.<//Text>

Great bloody mary and really enjoyed the breakfast burrito. We were staying next door so didn't have to deal with parking. Nice place right on the beach, awesome people watching. A little pricey but it's the waterfront.<//Text>

<Text>45 wasted dollars . Tried to get a table was told it was a wait I then just ask for take out and 3 separate groups of people were seated. Fish and chips ok at best . Cocktail sauce tasted like ketchup and very little horse radish. Your host specially said the calamari was fresh and the best . I recieved long chewy white square shaped strips.  Breaded and smoothered in I  dont know kind if sweet sauce. Needless to say not authentic calamari and nothing fresh . No better than long John's silver style fast seafood but way overpriced.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>The fried shrimp tacos were very delicious. The service however was a little slow to start and throughout. We were also trying to get a seat on the covered patio area but the hostess said there was a waiting list for the 5 empty tables available. I'd rather go to Oscars next time.<//Review>< pictures>

The food was great, my mai tai rocked. Wait staff in general was very nice, but our waitress seemed rushed and our overall service was very slow, and had to wait too long for the bill. Would have been 5 stars otherwise.< /Review>

We were in a hurry to eat and lucked at with a seat at the bar.  Our waitress was friendly and provided great service.  My wife and I both had the lobster bisque which was top notch.  I had the lobster tacos and my wife had grilled fish tacos.  It was all so good.  Thanks for the great quick meal.</text>

It is located right by the beach so we took advantage and got a table in their terrace which was nice and toasty thanks to their heaters,  it's an enclosed area yet still outside. The service was very good with many servers checking our coffee and often just seeing if we needed anything.  Our main server was delightful,  she had a very positive and outgoing attitude. The food came fast once we ordered and I was happy to find vegetarian options.  I had the veggie hash which was very tasty. It was overall a great experience,  food, service and location were great!<//Text><Date>1575685143430</Date>< rate>

<Text>Stopped in post-sunset for a Ruby Red and $3 Taco Tuesday seafood tacos. I always love the Ruby Red cocktail - delicious, fresh, big glass, only need one. First time having seafood tacos there - WORTH the $3/each! We had shrimp, fish and lobster. I could do without the lobster but highly recommend the fish. I'm not a battered fish girl for fish tacos but the batter was light and perfect and the piece of fish VERY generous! Had a bowl of clam chowder as well. Good but a tad pricey for the small portion (about a cup). Head out to see sunset if you get there early, or stop in for a post-sunset drink.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>Sue C.<//user_name><Response>None<//Response></record>

She had the scallops, they were decent. Scallops were cooked well, just not the best flavor profile in my humblest of opinions. Niece had the filet with lobster add on, all great. Server was awesome and attentive and made sure to take extra caution with my niece's treenut allergy. Would most definitely return if ever in the area again.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOigx1_PRZRlpP-1G2xR2JW4jNL_9H6xEUuNgim=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGKsSUp2ndt7Y8kYPGNpEjBv4UQhhyXKj4WWUG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

This place is unforgettable.  Right on the ocean, beautiful views.  Here's a trick:  eat at the bar and order a drink, (even a soft drink) and then you can order phenomenal specials for incredible prices!!  Unforgettable lobster tacos for $2.50 each.  Really.     Don't miss this place.< /text>

We went twice this trip because the first experience was not good. Food was less than mediocre and the service was horrible. Our second experience was even worse. It took over an hour for us to receive our food. We spoke with the manager who NEVER CAME BACK TO THE TABLE. He did not want to even try and make it right. In fact, he wanted to argue with us about our experience on the way out the door. Well never go back.</Review><user_name>Craig Vellar</user_name></record>

Great time, very family friendly and good drinks. Food was good too and very sizeable portions. Ended up ordering more than we could eat.
We sat at the bar area because the hostess said there were no tables available. By the time we left there were still a number of tables of all sizes open. Didn't end up being an issue, perhaps there are issues with reservation no shows.< /text>

< Review>
Terrible service. Took 15 minutes for someone to get our drink order. Took them even longer to get us a straw. We asked 3 waiters to fix the outside heater all of whom acknowledged the request but did not fix it. On the 4th try one employee was able to get us the straw we asked for and had the heater up and running within seconds. After finishing our meals, we asked for the check and a to-go box twice but did not get a response from our waitress, we then asked (whom I assumed to be the manager) if he could go get them, which was followed with a "yes" and then proceeded with him telling our waitress to go do it. The waitress took another 15 minutes before returning with just the check claiming to be coming right back with the to-go box. She then proceeded to have a very long conversation with the table next to us before taking their order for another 10 minutes. In which time we went to the bar for a box, payed the check, and were on our way out by the time she finally decided to get to it. I would not recommend this restaurant.< /Review>

Chef was excellent! Food was delicious. Our waitress was extremely slow (full story below). Scenery was beautiful. Maybe will try again and give more positive review.

Full story:
We're not impatient people, however, when you're practically choking and need a drink but the waitress takes 5 minutes to come out from the back, it's ridiculous. We weren't the only table she inconvenienced either because her other tables were complaining aloud about her service.< /Review>

<Text>Not worth the wait time or the price. at $25-$30 a plate you would hope at least one bite was good from the soup to the entre nothing to write home about. our waitress was horrible. We do have to give credit to who I believe was the manager, he is the only one to check on us and let my husband order 2 orders of oysters after our waitress informed us that was only allowed to be ordered in the bar, and wasn't willing to check for us when my husband asked......</Text>< Rate>

Potatoes were amazing. Poached eggs were a little runny. I got the hollandaise sauce on the side and I am glad I did because it would have been too much. Bloody mary was delish! Views were spectacular! Definitely come here to enjoy some yummy breakfast by the water.<//Review>

Have had good brunch here before but dinner is FANTASTIC. Enclosed patio for watching activity on the boardwalk, beachgoers, and sunset at the ocean. Perfect for groups, colleagues, or romantic date night. Valet parking option takes away the stress of finding a spot in this popular area.

We always love the crabcakes, lobster bisque (absolutely delicious!!), and fresh seafood entrees. Not to mention some very tasty cocktails. Highly recommend.</Text>

The reason I gave a 4 star rather than a 5 star is because of our server. He seemed like he didn't want to be there, forgot some drinks, and never refilled our water. Another server made sure we got what we needed though. My food came out 6 minutes after my family's food. I would go back to give it another try with a different server.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Was a twenty minute wait for a table but we were told there were some available seats in the bar area which there were. We sat there with our three year old daughter and received no service and nor did the family of four next to us so we all left.
0ne star for service. Two stars for location on the beach and three stars because the food that was served to people around us looked good.
Therefore a three Star review which I feel was more than generous.< /Review><username>Simon Howarth< /username>< Gmap_id>

Extremely popular breakfast place.  Be prepared to wait awhile for breakfast.  Lunch is much less of a wait and not so busy especially during regular week day. Many tables have good views of the ocean side, even some of the tables that are in the "indoor" (non patio) area.  Quiet, good service, good food, reasonable prices.  Overall a great place to eat.</Review>

<Review>Not sure how this place even has 3.5 stars. Service was atrocious. We were sat right away and then we're not greeted (as several wait staff walked by) for over ten minutes. Took another 30 for a glass of wine to come out, which came out after the appetizer we ordered.

We were sat at a table with an awful slant to it and as such, my water glass fell over, spilling all over me. I then proceeded to wipe up the mess myself, as our server walked by THREE times without saying a word. She then came over and acted surprised that my water had spilled.

Food was mediocre at best. But the service was just about the worst I've ever seen in a restaurant.

For a place called "World Famous" it didn't even CLOSE to live up to that. Will never return.< /Review>< UserId.>

First trip to Pacific Beach and looked online for a great place to eat lunch on the ocean. WOW!This place delivers and the food was delicious!  Every view was just like we were eating on Pacific Beach (without the sand).  Service was great and the Maine Lobster BLT was to live for!  Soups were great and the drinks!  We ate from the brunch menu on Sunday and the lunch menu.  Highly recommended and priced just right! Don't look anywhere else just go here!< /review>

Asked for ocean window seat. Told to wait????? We had to ask for manager to seat my handicapped dining companion.   Waitress was good. Food took a long time but it was delicious.  Used the delay to use the restroom. It was filthy, obviously had not been cleaned from day before.
Will never go to that location again.<//Text>< pics>

Im not sure" world" applys here, but good enough for many tourist with kids that are hungry. The bar menu is lacking for me the meat eater, fish folks will find it satisfing. The bathrooms are smelly. I was recommended this place from a local, but just didn't get it. Nice ocean view. I'll probably pass next time.< /Text>

<text>My boyfriend’s sister suggested this place for our entire group and I was a little weary because of the location but the food was decent. Honestly what you come for here is the view, it’s right up against the ocean with nothing obstructing you but people on the beach and the boardwalk. I didn’t love my food, but the family did! Maybe it was what I ordered which was the veggie hash. It was all bell peppers and little potatoes, I got more potatoes from my boyfriend and his father because their meals gave them 5x more than my hash. I got the macadamia nut strawberry mango banana (lol) pancake and it was delicious but the batter was spilling out everywhere the bananas were “cooked” in. I had to cut those out because I’m pregnant and uncooked food is dangerous, maybe they should just slice the bananas and put them on top with all the other fruit and it would be perfect.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

The food tastes awesome and the staff is nice. It was quite slow at times (even though not a lot of people were there) little warning if you order over medium eggs they will be served over easy.<//review>

<review>Came, saw, decided to try somewhere else. Very nice place right there on the Ocean front however I found the menu lacking. I'm sure they serve great food just not much selection in the steak department  Draws a young crowd for sure. Party on peeps🤗<//review><user_id>104189435257426603983< /user_id>< gmap_id>

<rate>4<//rate><Review>My friend and I met for breakfast, which we ate in the oceanfront terrace to enjoy the view of the high surf. My California omelette was quite tasty and the coffee free-flowing. This is a classic PB institution with reliable and good but not outstanding food. You go there to enjoy the view but discover surprisingly decent food and drink which is often absent from tourist hot spots on the boardwalk. Definitely among the better choices along the boardwalk.<//Review>< pictures>

My wife and I had been here before a few years back; for breakfast and for dinner. The food was great as well as the views. Having had this experience, we headed over for breakfast this morning. The place was mostly empty with maybe a half dozen 2 tops and one larger party of 10ish over in the corner; what one would expect for a Monday morning. We walked in and were seated right away by a pleasant young lady. We were waiting about 5 minutes without being acknowledged. I took a look around and counted 3 servers on the floor, all tending to the large party in the corner. Deciding to cut them some slack, we continued to wait. 5 more minutes. And wait some more. After about 15 minutes of not one server touching base with us, we left. (thinking back to our previous experience, I recall having a lack of service previously as well.) NO food, no matter how good it is, was worth the impatience of this level of service. Additionally, the dining room had a more than subtle scent of a urinal. NEVER again, World Famous. You are officially off my list. 2 stars taking into consideration my previous food experience; otherwise it would have been 1 star. We did end up getting breakfast at Woody's (which is directly next door) for about half the cost.< /review>

<text>You can't beat the view!  It is literally on the boardwalk across from the sand.  It is always a fun atmosphere and the staff are always a joy.  The food is great, whether you want seafood or something from land you can't go wrong with World Famous.</text>< pictures>

Hands down best restaurant in the area. I have never had a meal here that was less than perfect. The service is friendly and timely even at the busiest of times. The food is absolutely delicious, the scallops are a favorite! I get to visit San Diego once every couple of years and this place will always be the one I look forward to eating at most.< /text>

Best lobster bisque ever!! The service is pretty great. The parking can be difficult right out front but for $7 ~$10 w/tip you can get valet. The other option is a parking garage just east of the restaurant. It says $10 an hour with $40 max but they give you a 3 hour validation!<//review>

<Review>At first there was 4 of us and the next day there was 6, but both night and day the service was awesome, the view was great and we had a lot of fun. For single girls, the eye candy is great. A shout out to Julianne for Thursday night 4 person chillin' table and to Zach on Friday morning for putting up with our 6 person day drinking table. He's got some thick skin.
A big shout out to 6'4" as he put up with us and made us feel welcome at the restaurant even though we were obnoxious (well, I was anyway). 4'10" says hi!!!<//Review>< user>

I LOVE this place so much that I had my rehearsal dinner here in 2009. They were extremely accommodating and everything was perfect!
We eat here one monday a month now to catch their half off the bar menu. I even take my kids (4 and 6) who love their lobster bisque and fish tacos.< /text>

As a side, it shines beyond the feature dish.  Service sucked at the hostess stand, but once seated (either at bar or dining room) was pretty good, friendly,  and not too slow for a beach front restaurant.  Would go back....but for the slaw.< /Text>< Pictures>

Good food and convenient location and valet parking. I've been here many times because the valet is so easy. The atmosphere changes for dinner and gets quite a bit fancier. I enjoy the dinners, but personally I really like the tacos for lunch and beer while I sit in my beach get up. There's fixed Windows to the ocean so you don't get the breeze like other places, but really good for blocking the crowd noise or the cold.<//Review>

Cold food microwaved to reheat. Husband was finished before I got my food again. $30 meal should not have any issues. Waitress was great. The issues was all from the kitchen.<//Text>

We had dinner twice while on vacation. Its a nice layout. Adequate bar area, glassed in beach view tables and a dining room inside too. Food was decent. Service seemed a little out of sync. Tv's for football and a great 1/2 price happy hour...(crowded).< /Review>

Not enough seats for happy hour menu. The regular dining room was nearly empty, while the HH side was packed with a 45 minute wait. Why not open it up a bit more? Good food and drinks though, and wonderful view.</text>

Very good food but service was a bit slow. Took a while to get a forgotten side after the ffood was served. Food quality was good, food was hot, drinks were excellent. The view is amazing.(2016)
AMENDMENT: Had great service this time, nothing forgotten, amazing foid & coctails. (2019)<//review>

<review>Not a great experience. The food was overpriced and just ok. However, the biggest reason for just one star was that it took forever. We sat down around 7pm (after waiting for almost 30 minutes to be seated) and didn’t get our check until just before 9pm. Most of that 2 hrs was waiting for the food. They were “out” of multiple things including carbonated drinks.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>Good food, table service was pretty good as well, however in the evening the hostesses, wait staff, etc were all standing around seemingly ignoring a short line of folks waiting to be seated while they flirted and played with their phones. A manager finally addressed the issue but service was poor this time. Seems to depend on what staff is working. Great beach views! I'd recommend going for breakfast, great service during that time.< /text><Date>1539873419556<//Date>< Resp>

Can't really beat the location. Breakfast was pretty good and the portions were good size. Word of warning: Parking is almost non-existent, so give yourself plenty of time to look for parking and be prepared to walk.< /Review>

Absolutely love all the fresh seafood and the homie feel. Fancy but not too fancy. Always Pleasant servers. Always a great view. The clam chowder is amazing. Tuna tartare. Shrimp tempura. Even the prime rib is great. I could eat here three times a day if I could when I visit San Diego<//Text>

<Text>Had to bring it down a star during this visit because $10 for the ruby red cocktail seems pretty spendy during happy hour. That being said if you can get there on a Monday for the half price appetizers-that is a good deal! They are prettydelicious, but they did run out of the sourdough bread bowl for the lobster bisque.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>The lobster tacos rocked... however they do get soggy if you can't eat them fast enough. The guacamole was very tasty as well. It was fresh and made in the kitchen. Two dolphins were playing with some Surfers while we were eating. Fun to watch and eat while dining. I would go back.< /Review></record>

< Review>
I had high hopes for this place, especially given the name. After we were seated, it took at least 15 minutes for our waitress to even greet us. We had enough time to decide what we wanted for our entire meal before we even received water or our drinks. The waitress that did eventually come was not friendly and made it seem like we were a burden when we were asking questions about their wine selection. We ordered our entire meal right then, and our wine didn’t even come out until after we had finished our appetizer. My boyfriend’s water spilled all over him due to the table being broken and slanted, and when he was scrambling to wipe up the mess, not a single waiter or waitress offered to help or get us a rag. Our waitress even SAW him cleaning it up, walked by and ignored it, and then acted shocked when we told her we needed another one and some rags because of what happened. The food was very overpriced for the quality, but the service is what warranted the 2 star review. Awful service, and subpar food.</Review>

<Review>Has to be the worst food I've had since I've been in cali, To be a known seafood restaurant worst salmon I've ever eaten no taste at all pure fishy taste. Then the ribs was cold, mashed potatoes was cold. All of this World Famous food for 108.00 dollars wasn't worth 50.00 dollars sorry, I'm from Indy and they actually know how to make salmon and serve you warm mashed potatoes for a lot less money as well. Then dont even get me started on my dinner the chicken was dry as hell. Told them no mushrooms it was loaded with them I mean come on it wasn't even that busy it was Sunday night. OVERALL THE PLACE SUCKED.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>This spot never disappoints. Brought my mom for the first time for her birthday and she loved it so 5 stars for that. Servers are great, food is just enough to get you full but not so much you take the left overs..or maybe it's just me that I eat a lot haha

Got the wipe out dish and it was so much good food. Left one pancake. They were so fluffy I was crying...the bacon was perfectly grilled, and thick. Fresh squeeze orange juice, was that...fresh.

<Review>Beautiful Beachfront haunt attracts locals and visitors, great drink selection, menu heavy on seafood but all is very good. A little pricey. But, expected for the area. Imagine a sports bar that's bustling and casual with lots of energy...just add beach and fine dining.<//Review>< Pictures>

<text>Extremely disappointed. The atmosphere was cool with a great view, but my friend and I got food poisoning!!! Then I remembered they were closed for a minute after an employee had Hep A during the San Diego outbreak. I’m  completely disgusted now. The food wasn’t very good and service was slow, so won’t be missing anything by not going back.< /text>< Date>

The cocktails were well mixed and well balanced (not to much bar syrup, not too much alcohol). Scallops were cooked perfectly, and so was the cod. Service is slower but how could it not be as good food takes time to prepare. Worth the wait . So - order up some cocktails and watch the sunset on the perfect view of the Pacific you'll have if you sit on the patio. Was a great experience. We also had a 6 and 7 year old - totally family friendly !<//Text>< Pics>

The only reason I’m giving it 2 stars, is because the calamari was good and the wait wasn’t long, other then that there are better restaurants out there.
I don’t know if I’m just really high end, or expect to much but I personally wouldn’t come back.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Insult upon injury: ruined birthday dinner for wife and daughter. Server brought a complimentary cake for another table and shift manager then promised (2) complimentary cakes to go in 5 minutes after paid and left a big tip for overdone steak. Twenty minutes later he ignores question about where cakes are -- then when I asked another server about the cakes, manager got in my face and asked if I was asking about my 'FREE' cakes. Very insulted, I left and went to my family empty handed. Go stick 'em 'world famous.'< /Review>

We were visiting our nephew and his wife to meet your new grand niece when we came across this restaurant. They were booked, but there was only a 20 minute wait around 6pm. What a treat it was. Excellent food, friendly and lively atmosphere. Attentive staff. We sat right by the window and were able to enjoy a sliver of a sunset. I had the Brussel Sprouts, then the Surfside Shrimp Bowl with the Garden Salad with their creamy balsamic dressing. It's a party in your mouth! I will be referring this joint to everyone I know.</text>

< Review>
Inconsistent!  Brought my business here twice and the first experience was good, I particularly enjoyed a scallop appetizer.  Next visit ordered a trio plate, including the scallop.  This time my first bite of scallop also included about a half teaspoon of what I hope was just sand.  I say I hope because I can't be certain what this course and flavorless substance was.  But it literally ground against my teeth as I chewed the one time, and couldn't be broken down with my teeth.  It obviously was not meant to be injested.  It took about a minute to work all of these little stones from my mouth, from between my teeth, and around my gums.  Horrible!  Then what truly made the experience unpleasant was the host, and this was on Mother's day evening, insisting there was some issue with the server, when the lone concern I made him aware of was this foreign substance in my food.  I'd never go back here.  There's an unacceptable level of ineptness.<//Review>

Then walked in again at 3 to reconfirm a booth and that we're having an anniversary celebration.  7;40 we we're quickly walked to a table.  Nope we requested a booth for our Anniversary. Drinks came then salad came and before salad was done entree came
The scallops were runny and tasted like they were stored next to chemicals now cold. Dinner was removed and refunded. Husband was sad. I ate fillet and scallops.  I got very sick to my stomach and it took 6 days to feel a little better. Jen brought a box for leftovers and our check and left.  We weren't even asked if we wanted coffee.  Honestly ever one was rushing around like mice and rushing customers too.  Jen received no tip.  We always give at least a 30% tip but no one deserved anything. Last year we had a wonderful dinner there and even given cake on the house.  Obviously new management.  We won't be going there any longer.

I hosted a group of 9 friends there recently for a New Year's Brunch and when we asked in ADVANCE for separate checks, WF said that they offer only 4 checks no matter how large the group but the when they would only evenly split the checks for each two people, even if, i.e., one has only coffee and the other has a large meal and multiple drinks, cocktails, it takes the patrons experience into NO FUN fairly quickly, likewise they couldn't let us add the tips on our cards on the checks we were splitting!  SERIOUSLY will reconsider where we have our large get togethers so BOOKKEEPING DOESN'T TAKE OVER NOR BECOME THE FOCUS WHEN ADULTS WISH TO PAY THEIR OWN WAYS EASILY WHEN WE CHOOSE TO DONE OUT ESPECIALLY AS HERE YOU MUST BRING BOTH CASH IF YOU 0AY WITH CREDIT...</text>

Date of Visit: 5/23/17
View was great, which is what we ended up paying for.

The service was acceptable but our server was very quiet. 3 adults, 1 toddler, and our bill was well over $100. It's a bit ridiculous that the toddler’s pancakes were better than anything else we got and that they would charge $10.00 for plain pancakes. I ordered the Sausage, Mushroom Basil & Spinach omelet which was over-cooked (rubbery) and the only flavor I could taste was spinach. The sausage was cut up links (SUPER greasy) and I found no mushrooms at all. The side potatoes seemed to be par boiled, then tossed in oil with some parsley in it. There was no flavor to them at all. Overall, a major disappointment.

The orange juice was quite good, though.</Review>

<Review>Terrible service, disappointing food. Our server was completely untrained and unaware of how to do his job. I had to ask for everything I needed that should have been obvious or at least offered (i.e. spoon to mix the sugar in my tea, sharp knife with my entree, basket of bread while we wait for the appetizer). Our entrees took around 45 min to an hour to be ready. Lobster tail was good but asparagus was bland and potato scallops were dry. Not sure this was worth $46 a plate. Crab cakes were tasty but very small about the size of a silver dollar. Pretty disappointed in place that has great reviews and was recommended to us.<//Review><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe< /Gmap_id>< rating>

Another one of our favored spots at Pacific Beach for lunch... food is consistently good, decent prices ( $$), they have great happy hour appetizers at the bar ($) 3p...floor Staff needs to deliver a more genuine, parsonable guest hospitality approach, after all, San Diego is full of Tourists who's first impression of our city is through its people & food.  Restrooms definitely needs improvement!  Reflects how much the establishment cares about it's customers comfort & convenience. Hopefully, they give it some serious thought. Other than that...great location right on the beach...overlooking the beautiful Pacific Ocean!☀🌊🏖<//Text>

<review>This place has been around forever (although not in this location - use to be north 3-4 blocks) and has great views of the ocean. The food is very good and some say they have the best lobster bisque in America (? I haven’t had the easy coast version so I can’t compare). This place is almost always busy so reservations are a good idea or plant yourself in the bar area - you can order food from the menu and eat in the bar instead of waiting for a table. The menu changes daily depending on the seafood in season and from breakfast to lunch to dinner. They have more than just seafood, great pastas, steak and of course a full bar. Highly recommend but during the summer a reservation is almost a must< /review>< username>

I hosted a group of 9 friends there recently for a New Year's Brunch and when we asked in ADVANCE for separate checks, WF said that they offer only 4 checks no matter how large the group but the when they would only evenly split the checks for each two people, even if, i.e., one has only coffee and the other has a large meal and multiple drinks, cocktails, it takes the patrons experience into NO FUN fairly quickly, likewise they couldn't let us add the tips on our cards on the checks we were splitting!  SERIOUSLY will reconsider where we have our large get togethers so BOOKKEEPING DOESN'T TAKE OVER NOR BECOME THE FOCUS WHEN ADULTS WISH TO PAY THEIR OWN WAYS EASILY WHEN WE CHOOSE TO DONE OUT ESPECIALLY AS HERE YOU MUST BRING BOTH CASH IF YOU 0AY WITH CREDIT...< /Text>

<Review>The price. I cannot in good conscience believe that anything at this restaurant is worth wasting or ordering at the prices they charge. Maybe the kids menu but that's as close to reasonable that they get here. Artistically, World Famous deserves its title. The dishes that are placed before are worthy of prolonged appreciation and it's a shame you eventually have to eat them. The taste though, it is well below par. The ingredients sure are there but nothing was accentuated, featured, or made delicious. Especially for the price you had to pay for them. Some dishes were outright cold and undercooked, the rest were just blasé. It was a shame we had to eventually eat them. Will proudly never be going back.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Dont waste your time!! I was really excited to try this spot, reviews were great and it was right next to the hotel I was staying at. The entire experience was awful, I should have left when we were greeted by a rude hostess. We were sat and the server walked by multiple times before the manager took our drink order.   The food took forever (there was only 12 tables sat in the entire place) and when it came to the table it was definitely not worth the wait. The "omelet" was more like a thin egg wrapped burrito, it was nasty! The pancake was rock hard and everything else was edible. Dont waste your time or money, there is much better options on the boardwalk.</Review>

We ate at the bar next to one of the windows. Gorgeous view. The drinks were pretty strong which I appreciate. We had the clam chowder, lobster bisque, lobster taco, crab cake sliders, chocolate horchata for dessert drink.

The clam chowder was decent the lobster bisque was good and the crab sliders lacked flavor for myself and my partner so we sent it back. The chocolate horchata drink was really good :)</Review>

Went to dinner two times here on our vacation.  The clam pasta was very good. So good, I ordered it both times. The first night, the two hostesses working didnt even acknowledge us for quite some time. The second night, the same two girls were working and they just stared at us and told us they were full and didnt mention the open seating in the almost empty bar.  The first night we didn't get bread with our dinner like we did the second night.  We ordered an appetizer and it came out with our dinner which wasnt ideal. The service was good though.< /Review>

Very good food. Reasonably priced. Happy hour offers half off lobster tacos ($2.50). Requires you sit in the bar section and need to order a beverage. They are not street tacos but regular size.<//text>

Very good food, very nice service. The only thing you have to be aware of, though, is that it's going to be full and loud. If you don't mind that, then go there and enjoy the food.< /Review>

The price. I cannot in good conscience believe that anything at this restaurant is worth wasting or ordering at the prices they charge. Maybe the kids menu but that's as close to reasonable that they get here. Artistically, World Famous deserves its title. The dishes that are placed before are worthy of prolonged appreciation and it's a shame you eventually have to eat them. The taste though, it is well below par. The ingredients sure are there but nothing was accentuated, featured, or made delicious. Especially for the price you had to pay for them. Some dishes were outright cold and undercooked, the rest were just blasé. It was a shame we had to eventually eat them. Will proudly never be going back.<//text>

Places fantastic food is excellent service is great really enjoyed the visit. You coming to San Diego you got to visit this place not sure which is better the service of the food. Waiting for a table with a view is worth the wait can't go wrong grateful we were here.<//Text>

<text>Great view of the ocean and the food's pretty good but if you order the Benedict make sure you let them know that you like your eggs running as Benedict's should be. My wife had to return her eggs benedict 2 times before they finally got it right and got her the runny yolks. Parking is a real b**** and expect to drive around or Park far away. This is the price you pay for eating at a restaurant with an ocean view</text>< response>

This is just a nice place to go and relax with a great view of the ocean and the beach activities.  Good food, drinks, and service.  Sits right on the beach, and it can get busy, butbits worth a boost for sure.  We go every time we are in San Diego.</review>

First time visiting. It hit the spot after walking 1.6 miles down the beach from Mission park. Got immediate seating in the bar and had the Surf and Turf Eggs Benedict. The lobster was great and the eggs perfectly cooked. Overall, pretty nice experience and we will be back!<//text>

We had a late-night dinner here and the food was delicious. I ordered the potato-wrapped halibut and it was fresh and delicious.

The service was good, everyone was friendly and helpful.

Unfortunately, the cleanliness is typical of a restaurant on the beach in this area... Not great, but not awful, either. I was seated next to a window and the trim looked like it had been eaten/dissolved by termites or something else, and there was sawdust/dirt nearby. My chair was also wet when we arrived and our server had to wipe it off for me. The tables and linens were clean, however.

Also, the wait times for this place are pretty bad. Since it's a venue with a sunset view, anytime around dinner you should expect to wait for up to (and sometimes over) an hour. Even when we ate well past sunset (at about 8:30), we had to wait for 45 minutes for a table. The good news is that their restaurant system will send you a text message when your table is ready, so you can put your name in and then leave again.

Overall, it's a decent restaurant with great food and a great view... if you can manage to get a table!<//Text>

Great views and terrible service. Although we did not have a reservation we showed up to have something light and be on our way. Even the most of the place was empty we were told there was no seating and we may find a place at the bar. After hesitation we sat at the bar for maybe 10 minutes before getting greeted and offered a beverage I ordered a coffee and baileys to warm up a bit and even that was a tad disappointing. We ordered an appetizer and a soup. We waited for over 20 minutes with no refills, no food, no service. When we did finally get served the food, it was mediocre. After our week in San Diego, it’s without hesitation that I say this was our worst experience. There’s better food with better service elsewhere!<//Review>

Never had less than a really good meal here at world famous. From really good prime rib to a prime rib bits appetizer they also offer fresh seafood and the lobster tacos are very popular in addition to a great happy hour daily not to mention they are Oceanfront at the foot of Pacific Beach Drive. Pretty cool<//Review>

<text>First time visiting and we were not disappointed. Great atmosphere, great customer service. But most importantly the food was amazing! We had chips and guacamole to start and then ordered shrimp and lobster tacos. So good. Exactly what we were looking for when visiting the beach. We will be back very soon.</text>< Time>

<Review>Nothing else to say but this is the place for breakfast and bloodies in PB.  So good, great service, food is fresh and well prepared as well as unique.  Portions are ridiculous.  Bloody Mary's are tops, I never go to PB without hitting World Famous at least once.  Sentiments shared by many.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>A return trip to World Famous in Pacific Beach, San Diego and I was not disappointed!  We went on Monday afternoon for their half price bar food offerings and tried all of our favorites - the wonderful lobster bisque, the melty nut crusted Brie and their various shrimp appetizers!  My mouth is watering just remembering the great meal we had.  And half price on Monday afternoons. When in PB, World Famous is a MUST!</Text>< Pics>

<Review>It was a great time at World Famous. Their food was delicious. I hate their pork with scalloped potatoes and it was a winner. The sauce on the pork tasted a little weird though. Their desert was also good. I had the Strawberry Mango Trifle and it was heavenly. The restaurant is right next to the beach and the decor was nice. It looked nice inside. The service was good and quick. They were helpful. The worse part was the parking. It's hard to park there and it gets really popular at around 5:30 PM. We had valet parking though.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

My sever was great! But the hostess staff was not, we came here for our anniversary, and asked to be seated outside and by the window, and they said he tables were reserved but people were allowed to move their own tables to the ones by the windows. Why did I make a reservation if I was going to sit somewhere NOT by the window.</Review>

View of the ocean is fabulous. The shrimp tacos were very tasty, and the fish and chips were perfect. They do beer batter fish and chips, which as a fish and chips snob, is the only way too make them. The service was excellent! We had a great overall experience. We will return.< /review>

Food was ok at best and the main dishes were quite poor quality. It felt like more of a loud pub atmosphere not a great place for families or a nice dinner. Way over priced for what you get.

<text>I think World Famous could be a hit or miss depending on what you're looking for. It has potential, being right up close to shore with ocean views... but kinda needs a remodel, in my opinion. Locals love the menu for its shrimp and lobster tacos, but all the tacos are good. Great menu options. Also a widely known secret by now, the drink people know as a 'Two Straw'...is not on the actual menu... very good, very potent. Be careful with those babies....<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Everything we've had there has been top notch, and portions are large, so sharing makes it even more economical.
All seafood is fresh, so helps with the taste, plus the seasonings added and the preparation.
There are so many restaurants close by, yet this one always has customers coming in (good sign for those visiting to try a restaurant with steady customers). They don't take reservations, so in the evening you'll need to sign up and wait or come back within the time limit. For our group, it was a 2 hour wait. They'll text and call you when the table is ready.
Lobster bisque is very good! We order it every time we're there. Our son ordered the chicken strips kids dinner every time and it's satisfied his voracious appetite.</Text>

<Review>Like most food in tourist zones, nothing special. We all got fish and chips, ahi salad and the burger. The burger was good, the fish and chips were a bit overdone, and the ahi salad came without the dressing and was otherwise bland.</Review><gmapID>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe</gmapID>< username>

<Review>Good food and even better view! The food and drink offering, along with the staff, is above average but I typically only eat at World Famous if I am taking a friend or family member that is visiting SD to experience a meal with an awesome view.
Free public parking can be a pain to come by but World Famous does offer valet parking if you're not bothered by the $5+ valet fee.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

A bowl of clam chowder is actually a cup and has only a few small clam pieces and flavorless. Also had a pasta dish that came with a dried slice of bread and no butter. That dish also had very little flavor. Years ago World Famous had the best chowder and food on the beach. The prices are those of fine dining but neither the food or service warrant the cost.</text>

<Review>The entire menu is great and the staff are always friendly! From start to finish, World Famous has plenty to choose from that shows why they are so famous. If you want just tacos, ask for the bar menu. I personally always make sure to get at least 1 shrimp and 1 fish taco! On top of excellent food that has drawn people from around the world (this last visit, we ran into someone from Cuba that had been told it was a must), the view is also nice. Right by the beach, sunset is a beautiful accompaniment to an overall great experience.<//Review><Rate>5</Rate><user>113693651631677874864</user><Name>Alexis Vasquez<//Name>< pics>

Great view of the ocean and the food's pretty good but if you order the Benedict make sure you let them know that you like your eggs running as Benedict's should be. My wife had to return her eggs benedict 2 times before they finally got it right and got her the runny yolks. Parking is a real b**** and expect to drive around or Park far away. This is the price you pay for eating at a restaurant with an ocean view</review>

We had an amazing meal at world famous. The view from basically anywhere in the restaurant is amazing. Food was great! We had fried calamari, tiger shrimp, crab cake sliders and prime rib sandwich. The best meal we have had so far in San Diego!</text>

Great view from the outside seating. There are windows all around so birds and bugs can not come pestering you during a meal. The food on the other hand was alright, nothing amazing as I had their Beach Burger. Had the Mai Tai which was delicious though! Service here was great, constantly refilling water before I could finish mines.</text>

Terrible service, it was busy but still very poor service. Food was ok at best and the main dishes were quite poor quality. It felt like more of a loud pub atmosphere not a great place for families or a nice dinner. Way over priced for what you get. Quite run down facility. A disappointing experience. Stay away unless you want to be let down.< /Text>

Ordered a shrimp taco, a lobster taco, and a beer. The place was busy, but the food came relatively fast. I received a shrimp taco and a calamari taco. Both were ok. The toppings were overpowering the fried seafood. It was an ok experience, nothing to complain about, but I won't be suggesting this place to anyone< /Review>

Service was slow for the amount of empty tables at the time. The lobster tacos were good but the beans were bland and had some that weren't fully cooked. Probably wouldn't go here again for the food but would for the spirited cold brews. Those were 👌.<//Text>

Have been coming here for 10 years plus! Tonight's dinner was absolutely disappointing! The service was bad, food was bad! I had potato crusted sea bass.  The sea bass was microscopic & was covered with hash browns! My husband and two friends had the prime rib.  It was tough and chewy! It used to melt in your mouth! The bathrooms looked like the homeless had been living in them! How sad! Why do great places have to go down hill? Will never go there again!!! What a bummer!😢<//text>

<Review>Excellent boardwalk based location.  Drinks were quick, bloody Mary was different tasting, but in a good way. Carnitas chilaquiles were plentiful, but just the right amount of food to fill me up plus it was delicious.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

We had an amazing meal at world famous. The view from basically anywhere in the restaurant is amazing. Food was great! We had fried calamari, tiger shrimp, crab cake sliders and prime rib sandwich. The best meal we have had so far in San Diego!< /text>

<text>This place has been great for 20 years.  Prices for Sunday brunch we're unexpectedly low $14-17 for most Benedict's, omlettes, etc including those with lobster served with a view of the ocean and boardwalk.  The preparations were excellent with generous portions and excellent flavor.< /text>< pictures>

The Lobster Bisque and Brie were delicious! My Drunken Mermaid was good not very strong. The major downfall was the eggplant fries. They were so breaded and deep fried you couldn't find or taste any eggplant.  The service was so so.<//Text>

They don't have a huge range of seafood dishes from what I could see, but their fish tacos and basic chips and salsa more than made up for that!</Review>< Pics>

The perfect place to have cocktails a delicious breakfast or a nice dinner.

Your meal is created from scratch with fresh ingredients. Takes a little more time but enjoy the view of the surf and sip on your drink. If you cant wait hit jack-in-the-box.

Being a chef I really appreciate a creative but simple approach to there menu.

Bravo!< /Review>

< Review>
Great service. And the food was excellent. Nice experience along the shore and beach. The indoor atmosphere could use a little clean up and freshening since its a little smelly and dining furniture is very patio like for the fine dining prices and food. However,  one bite of those crabcakes and you know you are in the right place. I will choose this one over del Coronado any day.<//Review>

This place has a great location right on the boardwalk. The prices are good for being that close to the beach. They have valet parking which helps in that area.</Review>

<text>Friendly and fast service.  They gave us a seat by the windows, overlooking the beach, so we could keep an eye on our bikes.
The fish and chips were good, not greasy and much more fish than batter.
The lobster bisque was OK,  it needed more cream, more lobster and less thickener (cornstarch?)
The iced tea was exceptionally weak that day.
The pricing was fair, especially for a place right on the beach.</text>< pictures>

<review>Great place. Looking for a place with good fish & found this place on the beach. Reasonably priced & food was amazing.  The creamy balsamic they make on site is sooooo good!! We got fish tacos which were great. But the shrimp tacos were the best.  My one son got the burger which was great!< /review>< Time>

<text>The individual that greeted us was a guy who was at best brisk and at worst moderately rude. He did seat us quickly and the seating was quite nice. His manner was horrible.

Food was good not great clam chowder was exceptionally disappointing few clams lot of Chile lot of vegetables but again not very many clams. Our server was excellent Katrina I think was her name. She did well. A great job.

That's my personal opinion my wife also.<//text><Date>1516826339906</Date>< Response>

Went there Saturday evening for a relaxing sunset dinner with my wife. We waited 15 minutes and were seated. Then the hostess returned and told us this was another party's table. We were told to wait again. When we were seated for dinner, we tried to have a nice conversation and relax. It was so noisy in there I couldn't hear my wife talking. My wife enjoyed her food and tried to make the best of the evening. This was about as relaxing as eating in auto repair shop.</review>

<review>I really like this place, it's right by the beach. Food isn't amazing but it's good. They have good drinks and they have a parking lot you can get validated with.

I like the atmosphere here and that's right next to the beach in PB. Parking also helps because sometimes it's impossible to find anything here.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Awesome breakfast spot right on the beach in PB (Pacific Beach). They do serve other meals there as well and based off of the breakfast I’m sure they are great. The food is really good, the staff is always friendly and courteous, and the people watching and view is great. Ask for a table on the patio and you might even catch a glimpse of Slo-mo blading by! The only drawback is parking can be tough. You can valet for a nominal fee or park in the garage which they will validate for 3 hours! I alway park a block or two away, because I always take a walk down the boardwalk after eating anyways. Certainly worth the trip, you will not be disappointed. Prime rib hash, or Lobster Benedict come highly recommended.< /text>

By far the most beautiful and wonderful places to eat and see the ocean. Been living in San Diego off and on since 1989 due to being in the U.S. Navy, and is still my favorite place to over every other place to eat. Oh, and if you are single, great eye candy from the staff to passer bys. Lol<//text>

<Text>I had the Jalapeno Rib Eye, and the jalapeno butter was delicious.  I loved that it came out on a skillet, and teh vegetables were excellent.  The potatoes left something to be desired, but there was enough food on my plate.  I think I would have preferred a twice baked potato or something similar (it would have paired better).  The location is fun, they did make us wait for a really long time even though there were visibly open tables.  I felt like they were pushing for us to eat at the bar (to increase bar sales?).  Regardless the food was decent, but it's not somewhere I would go again.  The steak cut itself was not Prime, and for the cost it should have been; it was likely choice grade would be my guess.  Also I am not sure it was truly a rib eye based on the lack of marbling and very little fat.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>3<//Rating><review>Outstanding location for a restaurant - right on the beach. Ordered the prime rib and asked for an end cut. Let down on the taste - not very flavorful for what should have a lot of spice. Scalloped potatoes were excellent. Spinach was left out of seasoning.

We walked up without reservations and were told it would be 35 minutes and they would text us. Understandable for a Friday night except there were many open tables (reservations?). The hostess did suggest sitting at the bar which we did not.

After almost an hour we came back from a beach walk and they "allowed" us the next table that was being cleared. Not really sure if they forgot about us or just need a better process.

The service could use an adjustment and food could be higher end for the prices they charge. Probably won't go back.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<Text>I've been to this restaurant a few times & I usually like it.  My last visit wasn't so good.  Our meal was cold & both fish & meat were overcooked.   The lobster bisque however is amazing.  Great place for people watching.   I would probably stick to drinks & appetizers next time.  Long wait so make reservations.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Let me start by saying the food was outstanding. Best on my vacation. Although, the staff and service was poor. Our server, Charlotte, was awful. And the prices were high, compared to other close by restaurants. That will keep me from returning in the future.</text></record>

< Review>
We went for lobster tacos. They were awesome. I ordered a bloody Mary that wasn't very good. Their bloody Mary drinks used to be excellent. Not this time. My girlfriend ordered a mojito that was so bland that she was going to send it back, but our server didn't check on us for 15 min so she drank it.

Basically the food was awesome, the drinks were mediocre, and the service was pathetic.< /Review>

The food is fantastic and the views are incredible. Some of the best seafood I've had. Avoid the valet service, it's cheap and convenient but the guys who run it are rude. One of them followed us and asked my girlfriend for a larger tip.<//text>

Mondays are half off bar appetizers from 6 to 11pm. Oysters were lousy. Mushroom crabs were oily. Tiger prawns is good and lobster tails are great.

The prices were too high for the quality of the food! The scallops were gritty! The service was slow and had to wait with and empty water glass for too long!<//review>

Been here multiple times and it never fails that they are always super packed. The days were I plan ahead and get there super early for breakfast or on those lazy afternoon brunch moments world famous has crowds of people waiting to be seated from thirty to an hour and fifteen minutes. Luckily in this visit we arrived at 12:50pm, we're told it would be an hour and a half but were seated in 25 minutes. Good thing we were patient. We each had the lobster Benedict and it was yummy. Hollandase with asparagus and lemon mix with potatoes was just what we were craving. The portion seemed decent but once you get closer to devouring half you realize wait I'm getting pretty full already. On top of our tasty meal, the service was great. Our waitress was very attentive - no sugar she brings more; coffee half full she brings more; and was updating us on the status of our meal while it was being cooked ensuing us "I didn't forget you." always a nice brunch here. Oh and of course request to sit in the patio to take in the awesome view of the beach.<//text>

Do not come here!

Came here with a group of girls yesterday for brunch.  I ordered an Irish coffee with baileys (which is standard for an Irish coffee to already have) and was charged for 2 drinks. The waitress called over the manager when I inquired about the charge, who was ready to go into fight mode - so unprofessional, not how you treat paying customers.

Take your money somewhere else where they treat you like a customer<//review>

Great food, beautiful views! Located right on the beach boardwalk in Mission Beach, about a mile walk from the Roller Coaster. Gets busy and has long wait for table at mealtimes during busy season, but great food, drinks and service make it worthwhile. Families welcome.< /text>

<Text>Great food and service. The only problem with this place is that they have no consideration or respect for their neighboring guests. They perform loud maintenance on the equipment on their roof at 2am.  Next time consider your neighbors.</Text></record></dataset><record>

The prices went up and the quality went down a whole lot from what I ever remembered. The reason I have it two stars was the location. But my friend ordered the chicken Cesar salad and even that was disappointing. On both plates the meats were chewy and bland.

Order was messed up. Service was slow. Manager said an item would be removed from the bill since they messed it up and it was marked down to 50% instead of being removed. Took forever to get our waitress to take our order, an hour to get food, and 45 minutes to get the bill. What should have been an hour and a half experience turned into a 4-hour disaster. A large party, just like mine, was seated afrer us, got their food before us, their bill and were gone before us. Then another large party after they left were seated, food given and they were almost finished by the time we got our bill -after asking for it not once but twice! Food was cold or luke warm at best when we finaaly got our plates. Tasty but cold. Overall, I would not recommend this establishment< /Text>

I have been to this restaurant many times, always a great time! From the food, ambiance, staff and location right on the water you can't go wrong.

My last experience was worth writing a yelp review of. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was decently packed so we opted to seat ourselves in the bar section. We were greeted right away with water and menus by a very friendly waitress who also had some great suggestions of food. We ended up getting pollo asada tacos (which are on special every Thursday for only a dollar) which was one of the best tacos I've ever had. We also ordered the Nut encrusted Brie cheese that came with cheesy bread which was orgasmic. The only downside about the meal was ordering the jumbo Thai shrimp, it was over priced and the sauce it was served with was cold.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.</Review>

We got a simple bacon and eggs plate. The bacon was burnt to the point of it being inedible, the waitress was rude, and she forgot part of our order even though she wrote it down. Probably the worst restaurant experience Ive had<//text>

<Text>waitress was very pleasant and accommodating when we added one person to our already party of 4.  sat on the boardwalk with views of ocean and passerbys.  it was a Sat morning and kitchen was swamped.  our dishes showed evidence of rushed preparedness.  would go back.  plan on parking in the neighborhood across the street or pay for valet.<//Text>< userid>

<Text>Came for the lobster taco special and I was not impressed. The prices went up and the quality went down a whole lot from what I ever remembered. The reason I have it two stars was the location. But my friend ordered the chicken Cesar salad and even that was disappointing. On both plates the meats were chewy and bland. I was embarrassed because I had talked this place up and it did not meet my old expectations.</Text><Response>None< /Response></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I have been to this restaurant many times, always a great time! From the food, ambiance, staff and location right on the water you can't go wrong.

My last experience was worth writing a yelp review of. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was decently packed so we opted to seat ourselves in the bar section. We were greeted right away with water and menus by a very friendly waitress who also had some great suggestions of food. We ended up getting pollo asada tacos (which are on special every Thursday for only a dollar) which was one of the best tacos I've ever had. We also ordered the Nut encrusted Brie cheese that came with cheesy bread which was orgasmic. The only downside about the meal was ordering the jumbo Thai shrimp, it was over priced and the sauce it was served with was cold.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe<//Gmap_id></record>

Food was great.  View was spectacular.  I was disappointed that i ordered steak and scallops but only got two scallops.  For advertising as a sea food place it did not have much sea food.</review>

Terrible, expensive food, great view.  I ordered red snapper (not fresh) which tasted fishy and spongy. The waitress recommended it claiming it to be her "favorite". The side dishes were just as bad. This is my 2nd visit, and both times the food was horrible. The tables and chairs were in poor condition and not what you would expect for the prices.<//text>

<Review>Order was messed up. Service was slow. Manager said an item would be removed from the bill since they messed it up and it was marked down to 50% instead of being removed. Took forever to get our waitress to take our order, an hour to get food, and 45 minutes to get the bill. What should have been an hour and a half experience turned into a 4-hour disaster. A large party, just like mine, was seated afrer us, got their food before us, their bill and were gone before us. Then another large party after they left were seated, food given and they were almost finished by the time we got our bill -after asking for it not once but twice! Food was cold or luke warm at best when we finaaly got our plates. Tasty but cold. Overall, I would not recommend this establishment< /Review><Rate>1</Rate><username>Carla Van Wagoner< /username>< gmap_id>

<text>We sat at the bar an ordered a bunch of appys. Good food and the rib happy hour deal was quite a value. On the other hand, my old fashioned coat more here than at the hotel bar! Our server was great but it was very busy and she was a little overwhelmed so we didn't get things quickly. Not her fault but maybe they should reevaluate their staffing needs. We really enjoyed the calamari. It came out in nice big sticks that weren't overcooked as a lot of places tend to do. Of course the location and accompanying sunset were sweet!<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I've always had great experiences here when I come into town. The lobster bisque is my favorite item on the menu. As for meals, I've always enjoyed the cajan pasta and the potato wrapped sea bass. If you're not a fish fan, the spicy filet mignon is amazing as well. On a side note, if you're enjoy people watching, this is also a fun place as you can see all kinds of different personalities of people passing by on the beachfront.< /review>

The food was amazing .
We had breakfest there. I had eggs Benedict that were near perfect .

<review>waitress was very pleasant and accommodating when we added one person to our already party of 4.  sat on the boardwalk with views of ocean and passerbys.  it was a Sat morning and kitchen was swamped.  our dishes showed evidence of rushed preparedness.  would go back.  plan on parking in the neighborhood across the street or pay for valet.<//review><Time>1455666590544</Time>< pictures>

The service was friendly and prompt. We started with seared scallops and potato pancakes with lemon emulsion. Very good!

We had red snapper and salmon/shrimp/scallop/harpoon combo. The harpoon combo was very good. However, the Vera Cruz Red Snapper had too many hot peppers which made it a bit too spicy and almost ruined the dish. I had to pick out the hot peppers to enjoy it. Less hot peppers and a bit more salt instead was needed. Next time, I will pass on the Vera Cruz.

We also had dessert. Key lime cheese cake and creame brûlée. Both were awesome! Overall, we had a very nice dinner.< /Review>

Decent steak. Portions too small and selection was pretty limited. Didn't like the sauce on everything. A bit overpriced as well.</Review>

My adult son & I ended up here on a Sunday, because there was a huge line at Woody's. We were not disappointed. Brunch is huge, Mimosas yummy, view was amazing and Servers are above & beyond Nice & efficient!💜

Take Bus 8 from Old Town Transit, to Pacific Beach Drive, go thru parking strip to Ocean. U R there.

Catamaran Hotel is across the street (Mission Blvd). If you walk thru this hotel, you will come out on the beautiful BAY!😎< /review>< pictures>

First time. Location. Location. Location. Menu choices and execution very adequate with commenserate pricing. Service fast and friend ly. Take out as expected, but not exceptional. Table setting and atmosphere would not rate "word famous". Parking inadequate; especially for handicap.< /Text>

Nothing special. Decent food, sub-par beer choices for San Diego, kind of over priced. Loud, always busy.< /Text>

<text>I ordered 3 tacos, but I ended up being pretty full and only ate one. I didn't even touch the other two, so I asked for a togo box. I was told that I couldn't get a togo box because my food was bought during happy hour with a discount. I ended up having to leave two whole, untouched tacos, which were most likely thrown away by the waitress. What a waste of both food and money. Combined with other people's uneaten food, we threw away 5 whole tacos, which could have been someone's meal.
When we asked for our checks, we were told that it couldn't  be split, which would have been fine, except that the only reason was because happy hour checks couldn't be split.
The food was just average and their policies were illogical. I already paid for my food. If i need to pay an extra dollar for a togo box, I can pay for the box if it means not throwing away a wasted meal.< /text>< Pics>

From appetizer to dessert, World Famous was truly the most sensational dining experience of my entire life. The service was incredibly exceptional, and the flavor in each morsel of food to bless my tastebuds was phenomenal. The craftsmanship behind every bite was clearly evident, and I applaud the passion of the seemingly miraculous chefs in the kitchen. I live in the Midwest, and I am already planning a return visit to San Diego to specifically enjoy another meal at this utterly spectacular restaurant. I have recently had the opportunity to dine at one of the most highly regarded restaurants in Chicago, and after the first bite of my entree, my thoughts were, "This is nowhere near as good as World Famous". World Famous: if I ever become rich and famous, you can count on a shoutout from me in my Oscar acceptance speech. I hope one day in my future a dining experience can coexist beside you, but for now, you take the lead.<//Review>

Eric, the manager on duty was excellent!  I wasn't even there because I couldn't be.  It is my Dads 60th birthday and happens to bet there for a conference on his birthday!   I called Eric explained my brother and I couldn't be there on our Dads special day...... I wrote a quick birthday rendition and Eric had his dream team pull it off!  How personal and what a memory!  Couldn't have done it without Eric and his team!  Thank you so much for making my Dad's 60th one to remember!   My parents text me with a photo of the cake!  They loved it!  Priceless!  Thanks Eric and his wonderful team!</review>

This is the worst seafood I have had.  The presentation and freshness was on par with what I'd expect from Dennys.  Tasted microwaved.  Even the rice was crunchy.</Review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Bloody Mary's were amazing! Although, i wouldn't recommend bringing children.  The staff made it obvious we were not welcome. Also, there was a female waitress with brown hair and big glasses that was extremely rude to my husband and our 5 month old baby girl. Think angry 16 year old, snooty ex-girlfriend mentality, that made him feel like a jack ass for helping himself to a table, with our infant, after standing there for 10 minutes, looking at 15 empty tables, while she was on her ass nowhere to be found to seat us. #1 rule of customer service: help your customers! And sure as hell don't talk down to them when they did your job for you.  By the way, we were here at 3 pm... normal time to bring kids to a reataurant.

Here's a gold star World-Famous, for your amazing bloody Mary's. And heres a cookie for you, angry honey-boo boo 😘</Review>< pictures>

Great food and location. The service can be a little spotty if it's busy. Be sure to ask for the bar menu when dining as there are many dishes that aren't on the dinner menu.</Text>

<text>From appetizer to dessert, World Famous was truly the most sensational dining experience of my entire life. The service was incredibly exceptional, and the flavor in each morsel of food to bless my tastebuds was phenomenal. The craftsmanship behind every bite was clearly evident, and I applaud the passion of the seemingly miraculous chefs in the kitchen. I live in the Midwest, and I am already planning a return visit to San Diego to specifically enjoy another meal at this utterly spectacular restaurant. I have recently had the opportunity to dine at one of the most highly regarded restaurants in Chicago, and after the first bite of my entree, my thoughts were, "This is nowhere near as good as World Famous". World Famous: if I ever become rich and famous, you can count on a shoutout from me in my Oscar acceptance speech. I hope one day in my future a dining experience can coexist beside you, but for now, you take the lead.<//text>< Pics>

Always make it here for breakfast/brunch when we are in San Diego, or even anywhere close... will drive down from 30-40 miles up the coast in Carlsbad. Their lobster benedict is my favorite. Hollandaise sauce is bright and citrusy, not heavy like many others. And they have a pomegranate mimosa that is unique and delicious. Highly recommend!!!< /review>< pictures>

<rate>4< /rate><review>I have always had such great food/service here but my most recent visit was a pretty big let down.  We had a girls brunch (6 of us) and made reservations at 11 am.  Everyone was seated by 11:05 and it took at least 30 minutes for them to bring out waters and our first round of drinks.   They also only gave us breakfast menus which I though was strange since the table right next to us had the brunch menu.  The food was just ok, I  had the lobster benny and the sauce was pretty flavorless.  I will for sure be back, I'm just hoping this was a off day.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<time>1555873946307< /time><text>I ordered 3 tacos, but I ended up being pretty full and only ate one. I didn't even touch the other two, so I asked for a togo box. I was told that I couldn't get a togo box because my food was bought during happy hour with a discount. I ended up having to leave two whole, untouched tacos, which were most likely thrown away by the waitress. What a waste of both food and money. Combined with other people's uneaten food, we threw away 5 whole tacos, which could have been someone's meal.
When we asked for our checks, we were told that it couldn't  be split, which would have been fine, except that the only reason was because happy hour checks couldn't be split.
The food was just average and their policies were illogical. I already paid for my food. If i need to pay an extra dollar for a togo box, I can pay for the box if it means not throwing away a wasted meal.< /text><user_name>JJ Tran< /user_name>< gmapID>

Beach front property that doesn't even make Pina coladas. Wow. Plain Jane menu. Left after the appetizer. Didn't even give the food a chance. Service was a whatever attitude.  Would not recommend</review>

<Review>Went for breakfast. The pancakes were good, but there were these guys there putting tables together the whole time. This involved a very loud drill and guys carrying tables behind me as I ate. Also when they out the tables back in place no one wiped down or cleaned the tables. It was a little disturbing.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80dc01ee17bdf3f9:0x545f58eab788a2fe</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Visited for breakfast with my kids...the place was busy with a mix of tourists and locals.  We were seated comfortably and quickly.  Service was very attentive and outstanding.  Sadly, no one enjoyed their food.  The fruit served with pancakes was without flavor, and the pancakes weren't much better...the huevos rancheros was dreadful...lots of a red sauce smothering eggs and a soggy flour or corn tortilla, with refried beans on the side.  Wonderful location and delightful staff, but we won't be back.  Much better food options nearby.< /review>

<Review>Last year when we came here it was awesome, this year however was not so good 3 out of 4 dinners had no flavor, salt didn't help either, i guess they decided using any spices was too much trouble. Also we sat out in the enclosed area and the seats were so hard it was uncomfortable to sit thete too long.</Review>< pictures>

Best Breakfast place on the beach in San Diego! Awesome staff! Ask if you can sit by the window.< /Review>

This place came highly recommended by a friend.
We were a party of 4 plus a baby about a year old. We were seated right away. Our waitress Kristen took 10 mins before introducing herself and we waited another 10 minutes before bringing us the bread and our drinks. I ordered an appetizer right away which was the panko shrimp. We go our drink then the shrimp came out. The plate had 3 pieces of shrimp, some lettuce, and a type of dressing that soaked the bottom of the plate. 11$ for 3 pieces of shrimp that we're smothered in a sweet Italian dressing.
Then we called for our waitress that had gone MIA and she continued to take the order of a couple that had been seated a half an hour after us and then continued to check on a table that had already received their checks for "tip talk". Then after she passed our table once again and did not acknowledge us until the other tables looked satisfied. We were there for an hour before we were able to place our order.
My mom ordered a beach burger. It was a huge disappointment!!!!!! The patty was one of those frozen ones that comes prepackaged. She didn't eat half of it.
My daughters cappenelli didn't have clams in it like we ordered so we waited another 30 minutes before they brought her out a bowl of clams to add to her dish. All the while she fed off of my plate. The whole experience was terrible!!! From the waitress to the food! Yes the view was nice but there were plenty of other restaurants that we could have enjoyed descent food at. The food is not good. I don't mind paying the high prices if we get palatable food. I had high hopes but we will not be returning to this place.</Text>

Great view, bland, no taste food, except for the ribs.  Not recommended.  Very limited menu.  Just like all other beach restaurants.  $75.00 later we went to another restaurant to find a real lunch.< /review>

Went for a late dinner, arrived at 10:57 and was told the kitchen closed at 11 and I could order drinks until 12. Woman was kind, but be aware that if you want food the kitchen closes at 11 pm<//text>

sat us down immediately but took a very long time (over 20 minutes) to come back and ask for our drinks.

waitress didnt come by to check on us because it was busy and our drinks (just tea & water) were empty the whole night.

the other people near us were very rude and cussing and the employees didnt really tell them anything.

the food was really really tasty though.< /text>

Make a reservation, otherwise you'll need to wait a long time or wait a little less and sit in the bar where the drinks were great and we were told we'd get the full menu. But we only were given the bar menu and the bar food was disappointing especially for the price.</review>

This is my favorite breakfast spot in San Diego!!! I went in to labor here and watched my husband's ship sail away for deployment on their patio... two of the most painful days of my life and yet all I can think about is the soothing and wonderful taste of the eggs benedict!  ;)<//Text>

I had the dorado san jose and it was exquisite.  They were busy but we were seated quickly without reservations. I'd recommend getting them for dinner.  Staff was quick, courteous, & knowledgeable on the menu, but who cares...  Go for the food!<//Review>

As a professional reviewer, this place needs help. A run down decor and wait staff that looks like it spent all night playing beer bong.<//review>< name>

Had I hopes, dinned there on 7th july. Apps are great the red snapper was ruberry, replacement was same. Not fresh is not acceptable right on the beach. Place is packed. Will stick with bar food from now on. They forget to bring side back after replacing red snapper. Two different t orders neither were good. Prices are for fresh fish, and what was served was not fresh.<//review>

If it wasn't for the beach front view this place would have no chance.

<Text>I just love this place. I come to PB specifically to stay at Surfer Beach Hotel and have lunch and breakfast here. If there are one or two people, just sit in bar area if you don't want to wait for table. Great ocean view, lobster or carne asada benedict, and killer posole! Casual attire and prices are very reasonable.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>We started our meal with the crab cakes, which were wonderful but definitely on the small side (3 golf ball sized). Great tasting though and would absolutely order again. The caesar salad dressing was wonderful and home made. Tomatoes in the salad threw off the taste a bit but still a great salad. Lobster bisque was creamy but a bit bland but still better than many places.

The meal fell apart at the entree. We both got the filet and shrimp scampi. While shrimp was good, the filet was atrocious and covered with what could best be described as what one would put on a salisbury steak. If your filet needs any kind of gravy, your doing it wrong. The brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes also were just meh. Definitely not worth anywhere close to the almost $30 cost. I'll happily pay a mint for a great steak but this wasn't even close to mediocre.

If I were to come back, I would be much more cautious of entree or just stick with salad and appetizer.<//text>< pics>

I had the dorado san jose and it was exquisite.  They were busy but we were seated quickly without reservations. I'd recommend getting them for dinner.  Staff was quick, courteous, & knowledgeable on the menu, but who cares...  Go for the food!< /Text>

I had the lobster BLT, which had basically no lobster on it at all. Also, the beer here is very watered down. Even a basic Pacifico beer is watered down by half - so gross.</Text>

World Famous Restaurant and Bar will have you coming back again and again (expect a wait for your table in the restaurant). It is one of Pacific Beach's most popular spots. World Famous is the most popular restaurant I have written about in the last 7 months (Nov2016 to July 2017).

Interesting stylish interior! The whole front area facing the ocean has large windows for great views.. they have decorated the interior with graphics, wood and steel as well as interesting lighting in main dining area. The food is good (could improve on this though) and the service is top notch. The bar is very, very popular with locals and tourists, always a busy place, but if you love crowds visit during the summer; wow!, Pacific Beach is noted for crowds and World Famous gets a high percentage of the traffic.

You dine right next to the famous PB Boardwalk (most tables have the ocean view but the patio is the best) with streams of people passing by and just beyond the Boardwalk is the gorgeous sand of PB and of course the blue, blue Pacific Ocean. This is a  great place for camera buffs because the sunsets are gorgeous from here. Just a few blocks to the north is the famous Crystal Pier which makes a great silhouette for your special photo. Note: If you are putting people in your photo remember to bump flash as you will get a much better photo for your album.

World Famous has had a very friendly atmosphere every time I have visited so you can expect to have a nice time.

Some additional info on area.

I This is a great location near other cool places that you may be interested in:

The Surfer Hotel.. Beachfront rooms and moderate pricing (same location)

The Promenade.. an eclectic mini-mall (1/2 block east)

The Catamaran.. Stylish Hotel on Mission Bay (2 blocks west)

La Haina Beach Club.. Restaurant/Bar on the sand (1/2 block north)

PB Shore Club.. Very Popular Bar/Restaurant (3 blocks north)

Pangaea Outpost.. San Diego's best artist mall (on Garnet Ave)

Crystal Pier Hotel Cottages.. San Diego's most popular pier.. complete with fishing and it's own shops. Only "Sleep Over the Ocean" Hotel in San Diego. (5 blocks north)

Garnet Ave.. Most popular street in Pacific Beach. Packed with popular bars, restaurants (all types), boutiques, thrift shops, pool room (Society Billiard Cafe), night clubs, markets and much more. (5 blocks north)

And of course there is the very popular Pacific Beach Boardwalk.. this great boardwalk extends north and south for great walks or bicycle rides. 1 mile to north is very attractive and takes you to overlook La Jolla and the beach from atop PB's north-end cliffs and beautiful Palisade Park (almost 1 mile north)...  to the south you have 2 miles of popular boardwalk that takes you through Mission Beach and finally to the jetty which has view of ocean and Ocean Beach across the channel. Also, you can cross over to the Mission Bay Boardwalk which is only 3 blocks to the east and there you can enjoy miles and miles of gorgeous bay front homes and parks that wrap around the whole man-made bay (largest in SoCal).

Hope this helps!<//Text>

<text>On the boardwalk, touristy, n pricey.. I've been here on three occasions and like the location but the food is just ok.. Our waitress was not very attentive  and only really came around to take our order n give us the check, aside from that she was who knows where. we had to ask for water two separate times from the busboy...I'd go back n probably sit at the bar n pass on the table area..<//text>< rate>

<Review>I did my first official taco tuesday a few months back with a group of friends. I thought this meant authentic mexican tacos for some reason.. but it was not the case. There was a ridiculous line and wait for taco tuesday and when we finally sat down, the service was in a disarray and we couldn't get the attention of the server for a while. Once we finally did, I ordered shrimp tacos but it came with shredded american cheese on top and I was surprised by the combo.

However, it was good. I definitely had different expectations but perhaps it was just this joint that had it american style. My friend had the chicken taco but he said it was dry. I enjoy the view of the beach while eating tacos but the ambiance is different from sitting in an ocean-view restaurant. This seemed more like a casual sit down eatery.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

This place was a disappointment.  The service was poor.  My food was heavily salted and had to be returned to the kitchen.  I rarely think food has too much salt so this was ridiculous!  I assume it was the manager who appeared at our table to take reorders.  She was somewhat rude and very short with us, so I declined ordering a replacement meal.  This was the most negative experience during our vacation in San Diego.< /Text>

<Name>Kimberly Jordan Dabney< /Name><date>1480862266393</date><rate>1</rate><review>This place was a disappointment.  The service was poor.  My food was heavily salted and had to be returned to the kitchen.  I rarely think food has too much salt so this was ridiculous!  I assume it was the manager who appeared at our table to take reorders.  She was somewhat rude and very short with us, so I declined ordering a replacement meal.  This was the most negative experience during our vacation in San Diego.<//review>< Pictures>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Located directly on the beach - you can sit inside or outside very well - very pleasant location (no beach bar) you can eat more quietly here as there are glass walls facing the beach. The food is very good and also plentiful. We had salad - prices are ok.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Good quality. Terrace in front of the sea, enough space between the tables. The staff very nice.
The menu is not very extensive and does not have a great variety as is the case in Europe.
