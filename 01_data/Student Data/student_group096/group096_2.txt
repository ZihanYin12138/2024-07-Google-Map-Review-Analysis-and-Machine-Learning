<rate>1<//rate><Review>I ordered some skates but before I did I measured my foot and I reached out to customer service to confirm the best size for me to get.. well my calculations and customer services calculations about what size I should get were the same so I made my purchase I received the skates. Unfortunately they are too big.  They approved me for a return but say I would pay for shipping and they pay to ship back.. WHY am I paying double shipping for skates that are too big? I went off of their size charts and the advisement of a customer service rep when I selected my size so it does not make sense that I would have to pay to get the correct size.. I saw a bunch of bad reviews about this shop after the fact and I truly wish that I had looked before I leaped. The bad reviews stand out more than the good reviews and that is sad. I should not have to pay to exchange my skates unless I am upgrading which I was willing to do and pay the difference.. I emailed customer service about the issue of me paying to reship and no response back yet. If you order from here I suggest you try to sale the skates you ordered and shop somewhere else. I'm very dissatisfied.</Review><user>107278519989929478620< /user><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

Took way too long for a pair of "in stock" skates to be shipped. Customer service communications definitely did not make me feel like a valued customer. I regret apologizing for feeling like I was bothering them and somehow being annoyed for their terrible email response time. Then it took them forever to ship my order. I will not be shopping from them again in the future.

Furthermore, I ordered the Moxie Panthers, and the leopard toe caps didn't come with them. They did put in a crab tool, but it didn't fit any of my skate wheel or truck nuts, so I ordered another crab tool along with my Luminous wheels, from Eastern Skating Supply.

If you want fast shipping and more in stock choices go to Eastern Skating Supply online or RollerSkateNation.com. Both have excellent service and faster shipping.</text>

Used to love them, but they offer zero help when a package goes missing so order online at your own peril. Also I bought a pair of Moonlight Roller's safety dance skates online from here a few months back and they were already opened (not even put back in the plastic baggies correctly) when I got them, which was shady and I shouldn't have let slide since I paid brand-new pricing for them.< /text>

<review>We originally went in for skates wheels and laces but the sales lady had bad energy which made me and my friends a bit anxious once in the store (Two hour wait to get in once on the list)

The Black Moxi Skates Are great unfortunately the tool or stickers did not come In the box which is a bit frustrating for the price you are paying you would expect everything to be included. I asked the sales lady to check to see if they had a pair in stock with everything included she walked to the back didn’t look at anything turned and walked back to me and said no. Like I did not see her walk 10 feet turn around and come straight back.

The lady who cashed us out and fixed the internet was great and the young Lady who took our name when we first arrive was extremely friendly. We really just had the wrong person help us which really did not make us feel good about spending money there.</review></record>

<Text>Bought a pair of Beach Bunny Moxi skates from their online website. I am a new skater and had recently been using some cheap skates and decided to get these higher quality skates. They are AMAZING! My feet feel super supported while also not being so stiff that I can’t do tricks. This place is the only spot I could find Moxi’s, and with a great price for such a high quality shoe! (Even their own website was totally sold out!)

Super satisfied with my order. Because of covid it did take a bit longer to receive but still came a lot faster than I expected. Would love to check out the actual shop if I ever visit the area.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

I ordered skates May 15, 2020. I had picked a different style than what I REALLY wanted because it said the others were on back order.  After about a month, I hadn’t received correspondence as to when I would be receiving them, so I emailed asking what kind of time frame I should expect. They said due to COVID-19 the manufacturer they get them from had delays since they had to shut down. Understandable. Another two weeks go by, I hadn’t received them, so I emailed July 5, 2020 asking if I could update the address for my order since I’d be moving. It was updated no problem the following day. Fast forward two months to September 7, 2020 still no skates, so I email asking for a refund because at this point I’ve waited almost four months for $314 skates. I don’t have a lot of money and they were something to gift myself for the hard work I do. I got an email back saying they were sorry *I* was having problems with getting my skates? I’m not having trouble with getting them, you’re having trouble with processing, shipping, and delivering. I wanted to support a small business, but it seems that they’re ill equipped to handle the volume of orders they’ve got. It was also stated that refunds take 3-5 business days to process, but to allow up to 10 before I should see my money back in my account. Okay, cool. I’m just happy to get my money back after not receiving what I paid for. No harm no foul, however, I get an email the next day saying the skates have been shipped. I’m confused. I email asking why they’re being sent if I said to cancel it and refund me. I’m told they didn’t receive the cancellation in time, so their supplier went ahead and shipped it. It’s odd to me that after waiting four months, suddenly my skates are being shipped when I ask to cancel the order and for my money back? I get another email a few days later saying the skates have arrived, I check, they’re not there. I email saying I haven’t actually received the skates. I’m told sometimes they say they’ve been delivered when they haven’t actually got there yet or that the carriers put them on the wrong doorsteps and to check my neighbors house. I live in the suburbs and have received packages easily every other time I get them. I’m also told to wait to see if they show up before they move forward to put out a claim. I’ve waited an additional week at this point, we’re also coming up to the five month mark. At this point it seems like I’m getting the run around and they don’t actually want to give me my money back. It’s also disheartening to see that there are others who were able to get refunds with no issue.<//text>

<text>I ordered skates online the day after black Friday I believe. I really wanted to support this small business. I know some reviews said the shipping was taking forever but it seems they have caught up. My package shipped in a day or two and I received it a couple of days after that. Thank you guys for continuing to work hard during this time!</text>< Pictures>

<text>Made two separate orders less than 5 minutes apart from each other, then emailed to ask if they could combine shipments. I got a prompt “no”, and had to pay twice for shipping. Okay, that’s fair. It was my mistake, but I feel that it’s easy to just put the items into one box and print one shipping label... anyway. Received both orders, one of which is missing two of the items I ordered. I did receive an email back and am being shipped my missing item.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Text>Excellent customer service! I ordered a pair of skates, six pack of pads and toe caps. Everything but the skates were at my house in a week. I emailed customer support because I found a pair of skates that would be at my home sooner than January. I got a prompt and friendly response from Millie and there was no issue with the refund. The website is very easy to use on a desktop or phone and I'll for sure come back for my future roller skating needs 😊<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

< review>
Ordered a few things while, like so many folks now, I wait for some new skates. I have been rocking some old derby skates at the skate park and wanted some new wheels to see if they make a difference. Shipment came as expected, and everything was included in my order, but my wheels that I ordered were the wrong size. Knowing how busy skate shops are, I emailed them to see what could be done. I got a email back right away with a prepaid return label. I was so shocked! I was really expecting to wait at least a week before I even got an email. I dropped off the wheels at the post office and 2 days later got another email thanking me for returning them and that they would send out the correct size right away.
Folks, this is how you do it. Kindness goes so long. I was ready for a wait. I would have been JUST as happy and appreciative if I didn’t get an email back right away because we are in a Pandemic right now. I’m so happy to have been contacted this fast but more impressed with how kind the customer service is.
I would like to say THANK YOU for working so hard during this unprecedented time to get folks little slices of joy into their lives.< /review>

Multiple people have reported that they don’t receive response to their questions. They give people the run around when trying to get a refund. Also have people waiting for months to get their orders (some never receive them) and then blame it on covid. As expensive as the skates are and the fact that people are trying to support a small business and y’all just scam them is sad. I hope they all get in contact with one another and sue this company.<//Review>

<Review>I ordered online and was originally told the wait was 6/8 weeks. My skates finally showed up 17 weeks later. About 4 weeks into having my skates ordered I unexpectedly moved and had to change my address. They told me they changed the shipping address. After 16 weeks I finally get a notification saying they shipped my skates, but I notice it says it’s going to ship to my old address still. I emailed them again and they said that they “checked” the system and it was going to the right address. Well, guess where my skates ended up? 45 minutes away in a town/house I no longer live at 🙃 After paying $300 dollars for skates, I expected better customer service. They have yet to respond to my email concerning this issue. I’ll never waste my time or money with this company again.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
19 WEEKS WASTED. Very disappointed. I ordered skates in May and was told that there would be a 9-12 week waiting period. After two weeks, I got an email saying the skates I ordered are unavailable and I had to pick different ones which at least the offered a discount. 15 weeks later I get an email saying that I have at least 2-3 more weeks to wait. At this point I had already moved and just wanted my skates. Since they had no idea when they could be ready I requested a refund which they said would normally take 3-5 business days, but due to covid it was upped to 10. 15 business days later, I still do not have my money back. I was looking forward to supporting a small business, and I tried to be as patient as possible (and I have lots of patience). I have never been so disappointed by  a store. Please give me my money back.< /Review>

Order was received with the wrong product. Conversations with customer service took days at a time to get a response. Replacements for the right product were supposed to be shipped once the return was delivered to the post office, replacements did not ship until 5 days later. Given the extensive delay in the customer service teams response with updates the skates that were purchased as a gift did not arrive in time as promised by one of the multiple people that were part of the group email. Three weeks after the initial communication to address the error and there was still no resolution, no stock on the skates and no communication for return. I originally chose to order from this company to support small businesses but the lack of communication and length of time to get a response is not worth returning for future orders. For the same price the skates were ordered direct from the manufacture site and arrived before the replacement skates left the Pigeon facility.</review>

I wouldn't return. Guess the lack of supply with such a high demand gives them room to have terrible customer service.</Review>

Just be prepared to WAIT, if you wanna go to the physical shop. I showed up this morning around 11ish. They can only help one person at a time, due to Covid and such. I started out as the 3rd person waiting in line, and it was about 40ish minutes before I was able to enter the shop and be helped. The staff was friendly and helpful. Not sure if there's any way to make the line go a bit faster?  All in all I'll be back💖</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Time>1589116681031</Time><rate>5<//rate><review>Really great shop online. I ordered custom jackboots and they came so well put together, just ready to slip on and ride. The only complaint I have is I had bought some expensive wheels and they went on sale a few days after I bought them and when I asked if mine would be damaged they said no mine won’t be it’s just they yellow quick. Understandable but mine came very yellowed like something that sat on a shelf since the dawn of time, so just double check your orders. Because I was told one thing then got a defect item on full price. I’m not the type to fight over that and my wheels were going to get dirty anyways but that’s really important to some people, maybe they’re making a YouTube review. Other than that I really like this place.<//review>< pics>

<resp>None</resp><text>I was literally just there 5/17/19. The two women working there today were helpful and polite. they made sure the skate was comfortable on my feet and all the bearings were tight. if I had ordered online I may have gotten the wrong size or a poorly put together product which is dangerous when you don't know much about skates. so I am glad I went to Moxi and I love my new Roller skates. Even if your not sure you want to buy, its good to go in and try on some or get an idea of what you may or may not like, or get advice/tips for buying especially if its your first pair or if (like in my case),its just been a while(many many moons) since you've used a pair of roller skates.  I would highly recommend Moxie,  they're awesome!!!</text>< Pictures>

Pointless if you want skates in size 5-9. I waited in a long and slow line just to get a lame response and no solution. It’s insulting. They could at least put up a sign: “limited supply available” or something. I wasted my day and they don’t answer their phone at all. You guys should hire customer service people since you are a popular and a continuously growing brand nationwide.</Review>

<Text>Not a review ***just a comment regarding another comment I read that was from a not so happy customer. Regarding driving back and forth 45 min. And sending her teenage boys in to pick up the skates ..etc ... I was a little disappointed in the response from the store (keep in mind my opinion doesn’t matter..so don’t pay no mind to me). But people are going to leave bad reviews, there’s no way to avoid it. Replying to the comment was the right thing to do. The reply however lacked true customer service /professionalism . Let’s assume that she did send her teenaged kids into the store and that everything you said was correct...this isn’t the place to come back with attitude. Even if the customers wrong. Customer service  is about finding a remedy that pleases the customer. Customer service is not something that everyone should assume they can do .  While the person responding may have thought it the right way to respond, it’s not a good representation of what the store would want to project to the public.  Customers are wrong and customers are right and  it’s not the stores intention to disappoint a customer regardless. Striving to win back the trust of a customer and making sure they understand how you can help them best while saving them any more unnecessary drive time should be the top priority. That’s what the customer needs to hear Every customer should feel like they matter even when they are wrong. Not that she was wrong ... anyways I’m just saying. Having one person who is extremely patient and can be kind and calm no matter how rude someone is to them- well that’s who you should have respond to complaints- “kill em with kindness”  and not a sarcastic kindness ...a genuine kindness . That’s customer service . Quality over quantity.
P.s can’t wait to come to the store and shop and meet all you wonderful gals. Do you still do that thing where you meet up and go for a skate in the evening? I think I saw that somewhere posted?  Thank you .<//Text><pics>None</pics><time>1595280350306<//time>< rate>

<Text>So disappointed. I ordered skates from the on-line store even though there was supposed to be a 2 week wait for shipment because I wanted to support a small women-owned business. Well 3 weeks later I got an email saying that the skates I ordered were out of stock and my order was canceled. I had also tried for weeks to reach customer service to answer a simple question. My question was finally answered after my order was canceled. Because of this and after learning about what happened on their facebook group page, I won't buy from them in the future. Yesterday I ordered the same skates from another company for less money and they shipped today.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I have been waiting for my skates for a month and I’m just wondering when they will come. They have yet to send a tracking number. I understand that the circumstances are different due the pandemic but I would just like to know how long it has taken other people to get their skates during covid because I am just confused on when I am going to get mine.< /Review>

<Text>Can’t vouche for the “awesome customer service” since it’s nearly impossible to get into the shop.

Online service on the other hand is horrible. It literally takes 3-5 days for any kind of response.

Return/exchange procedure feels like a nightmare.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

While in LB on vacation from Lake Tahoe the Moxi shop was on my list of to do's!!! Hiding my fan girl excitement I was able to get lots of info and try on many different skates that aren't available to try on in Tahoe area. Great shop , top tier skates, with amazing staff and lots of glitter !!!<//Text>

Ok place,expensive fashionable rolling skates the only reason for 4 stars is that the seller person didnt check the wheels to light up correctly,one wheel doesn't work as supposed to work and that will cause me to go back to exchange it and that will cost me 2 hours of my life and some money in the top of the 325 paid for the rolling skates.<//Text>

Whether your you enjoy roller skating outside or you are a competitive roller skater .... These boots are great.  These high end outdoor/indoor skates.  I skated for 26 years tried these on and feel in love.   My skates are on consignment right now so as soon as they sell I am going to put the money towards a new pair of "Lolly's".

Both times I have stopped in there the girls were great to talk to and share information.  Such a fun place to visit.  I highly recommend if you are looking for a good pair for Roller Skates for outdoor/indoor check Moxi Roller Skates in Long Beach.</review>

<Text>HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!!!! I bought two pairs of shoes and took them to Moxi and they told me to leave the shoes there so they could fit the plates. WEEKS later I pick up the shoes, plates, and supposedly all of the parts, get home and I'm missing all of the nuts and washers. I drive back to Moxi and pick up the nuts and washers (45 min drive ONE WAY). When I get home I start assembling the skates and realize the PLATES that supposedly were custom fit, didn't fit at all. Instead of driving back, I grinded down the plates to fit and almost fully assemble both pair of skates and realize the TRUCKS are not all the same. I call the store and speak to a teenager who says "the managers don't hold normal business hours." She had no idea how to deal with this type of complaint and said"I'll leave a message for my boss." I asked if they had customer info on file to refer back to and evidently they don't log that info. I asked for the corporate office but evidently it's a small hole in the wall business. I left my number for the store manager to call me back. Four trips, 45 miles EACH WAY because they obviously don't understand "QUALITY CONTROL!!!" And chances of them accommodating me financially due to their screw ups is slim to none. So the two pair of skates will go back for a full refund and negative commentary placed in every review app known to man....... Including the better business bureau!!!!!<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dd310f283b8a79:0x555fc4cf7d59ce02< /gmap_id><user_name>Shawnna M-M<//user_name><resp>{'time': 1507063314109, 'text': "Sorry you are upset. It was your teenage boys who came in so I can understand that they did not communicate with you on what actually happened since you were not here. We told the teenage boys, who were the ones who came in, over and over it is best if we do the work/mounting/labor for them. They refused. It is a VERY delicate process that, if you research, IS NOT recommended for inexperienced people to do themselves. They refused to use our services to mount and wanted to do it themselves. Not knowing anything about metal insoles or mounting skates, I can see where they ran into a problem. Typically if a customer thinks something is wrong they don't modify the item but bring it back or call into the store and ask for help. Your teenage boys did not call in to ask for help nor did they purchase the nuts or washers but when they came in the 2nd time we gave them to them for free. Your sons were very nice boys but maybe you should go with them when they purchase specialty items that require assembly so you can have all of the accurate information when you want to write a review on their behalf.\nHave a nice day."}</resp><Date>1507043572821</Date></record>

<Text>I am angry at customer service. I ordered toe stops in August and didn't get my item till September. I tracked my shipment and it wasn't even processed at all!!! When I message customer service, they said that they were going to ship it soon. Then weeks later, I tracked my shipment and it wasn't even processed!!!! I message customer service and they apologize for the inconvenience and offer a skate tool as an apology. After another week, I finally got what I ordered but no skate tool!! Customer service is not good at all! If you're going to go on vacation and backing up shipment, at-least put a notification on the website that orders are on delay instead of inconveniencing your customers who are wondering where the hell is their product that they ordered!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't even know the office was closed for labor day for like a whole week and I'm over here wondering why its taking weeks after I got a message from customer services that my order was going to come soon!!!!!!

I am fully aware that the website is different from the store but there were no yelp website or anything else to review it on. If they are independently owned, they surely are making your company as a whole look bad. Suggestion, you should get a hold of them and better their customer service!!! Other than that, upset reviews will still come through because you guys selling the same product.<//Text>< pics>

Customer service is absolutely terrible. Our family made a special trip to LBC to get my daughter some roller skates, pads, and a helmet and were very disappointed on how horrible one particular employee was toward us. Preconceived notions about the type of people we are — and who are potentional customers — and treating us poorly based on your bias is a poor business model to follow. We were fully prepared to buy skates for both myself and my daughter after months of waiting to come here specifically and it’s unfortunate to say we walked straight out based on how rudely we were treated by the one chick behind the counter, who made it very clear she didn’t want or need our buiness — so good luck.< /Review>

< Review>
Great skates, but don't order them online directly from their website - go through amazon or something. I never post reviews about anything ever but I felt this needed to be said. This whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth and makes me not even want to skate anymore.

I pre-ordered the green (honeydew) color on June 12th and assumed they would ship when the skates officially released (June 14th I think), because that's how pre-orders are supposed to work. I also ordered a set of trick wheels on or around June 16th.

The confirmation e-mail they send when you place an order says "it takes 2-3 business days to process your order once it has been placed and 2 days to ship," unless they're out of stock, then they'll notify you. The e-mail also says the skates can take 1-5 weeks to make if they're not it stock. I assumed I wouldn't have to deal with any of that because, again, I placed a pre-order.

On June 26th, 2 WEEKS after not hearing anything, I e-mailed them and asked if there were any updates. After e-mailing several times, I didn't get a response until July 2nd (a week later), and was told that if I ordered after April 1st the skates would ship out in the order they were purchased... That's doesn't sound like a pre-order to me.

On July 18th I was done waiting and proceeded to cancel my orders (both the trick wheels and the skates). I would order a different color through amazon instead. The trick wheel order was canceled the same day, the skates were not.

I e-mailed again on July 20th asking them to cancel my skate order. July 25th, I WAS TOLD MY SKATES HAD ALREADY SHIPPED AND THEY COULDN'T CANCEL THE ORDER. What!? That really pissed me off - you can cancel the wheels the same day but you wait until it's too late to cancel the skates? I honestly feel like they stole my money.

I finally received my skates on July 27th.

TL;DR - IT TOOK ME OVER 6 WEEKS TO GET MY SKATES, EVEN THOUGH I PRE-ORDERED THEM. Their customer service is sporadic at best - sometimes I would get an e-mail back the same day and other times weeks later - which ended up costing me hundreds of dollars for an extra pair of skates that I now have to send back to amazon (which I received in less than a week btw, shout out to amazon).

Thank you for reading, I hope this review helps someone.

edit: I'm sorry, but for the sake of visibility, I cannot remove this review. The online shop and physical store are connected as far as branding goes - it's all the same from a customer's perspective. I did also leave this review on yelp and have seen other reviews cross-posted in both places as well (about the online shop and the location).

Either way, I was not confused, I was mislead. On the website, the summer color listings had "pre-order" in the title until June 14th, which would lead anyone to believe they would get their skates just like any other pre-order up until that date. Moxi should've been much clearer about what a pre-order means for a small business with handmade items, as it is not common knowledge. They could've done that in a number of ways (ex. through social media, in the description of the listing, etc.), so there is no excuse. Thank you.< /Review>
<Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1532870884284, 'text': 'Hello! Your review seems to be for moxiskates.com which is not our business. Moxiskates.com is completely independently owned from the physical Moxi Skate Shop that this review is showing up on. Im not sure how someone would write a review for a website as I’m not sure there is something like yelp for online store but can you please remove this review as it is not an accurate reflection of our business?\nAlso just a heads up preorders for handmade items aren’t like preorders for things made in China that come in bulk. I understand moxiskates.com or it’s counterpart on instagram @moxirollerskates (we are @moxiskateshop and our website is Moxi longbeach.com we personally don’t sell online) didn’t advertise well enough to let people know that release date was the first 50 handmade Honeydew which were preordered by amazon and other customers in February. Each week after that would cover another 2-3 weeks of spring preorders. If you ordered in June then your at the end of the chronological list of getting that hand made item. Just so you know that no one was pulling your leg or anything. All small businesses and skate shops have experienced customers who are confused on how handmade preorders work over made in China (example Nike shoes).'}</Response>< gmapID>

The owners are the most active owners I know. They skate daily, in the streets the beaches roller derby or as the ever so badass Moxi Street Team!! They KNOW what they are selling, they will never up sell you on items you dont need but will help you if you should have questions about said products. Going go the skate shop is like going to the Dr, you need to write out your questions, do your research on options and youll get educated at the same time!!
Skate services are offered here!! They can change out your plates for a small fee.
Check times and hours before driving out or give them a ring. 99% if they dont physically have it in stock they will order it for you, or its no longer in production.</Review>

<review>Omg if I could give this place a 0 I would. This place has horrible service and customer service. Got a fill done and the next day one nail broke from scratching my back and on nail got a crack on it. I go back thinking that they would fix my nails and make them thicker. They debated and pretended to not speak English. When the lady spoke English the whole time I was getting my nails done. They even said that I would have to pay full price. They stole my time and my money. They we’re extremely rude!</review>< Pictures>

<Review>As far as the work they did, it was great. I loved how my nails turned out, but there wasn't really anyone there who spoke English, the communication was difficult. The massage chairs they have are old and make a lot of noise and shake you really hard, not comfortable.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKaEFcFtyt2b2jvR-Bc2iipwOgf5HInrVztciI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxsVD2jJv-olR6eWPZ-6C-0ObYc3wSqvRQP-v7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< rating>

I definitely love coming here ! 💗 I’ve been coming here for about 3 years now ..
The service is honestly good but they’re just not talkative which I don’t think it’s a problem just thought I’d put that out there cause people might confuse them with being “Rude”. Anyways I definitely recommend 😊 Thank you Lee !!<//text>

<Review>I seriously wish I could give 0 stars. I’ve been looking for a good nail shop and decided to give them a try. I got a gel pedicure which was okay , he could’ve took his time and did it better but whatever. I then asked for a full set with gel , I already had gel/acrylic on my nails from a previous shop. He kept insisting I get a fill ( I assumed he didn’t feel like doing a full set )  and I finally just gave in. Not only did he rush , he didn’t apply the gel properly, it was super sloppy , he kept stopping to watch the tv and text , he kept pushing my hands instead of actually talking and on top of alll of that literally an hour after getting my nails done one broke. The day after another broke. This is seriously ridiculous. There is absolutely no reason why my nails should be breaking already. I would absolutely not recommend this place to anyone. They’re unprofessional, rude and quite frankly do horrible work.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<userid>110431067361611700000<//userid><rate>1<//rate><Response>None</Response><Text>Terrible experience. The language barrier did not help. There really wasn't anyone there that spoke English. The Asian guy that did my nails provided horrible customer service, on top of that, he kept speaking to his co-workers in his language and pointing at my direction. Either he talks negatively about his customers (like me) in his foreign language, or he was asking for help...I don't know. Also, he kept trying to scold me and was yelling at me because I kept trying to explain how exactly I wanted my nails done. I must admit I was getting frustrated trying to explain, the asian guy showed no patience or professionalism in trying to understand the way I wanted my nails done. In the end, my nails were crooked and the asian guy was already in a rush to kick me out of the shop. I will never do business with this establishment again.< /Text><time>1511413236018</time><pictures>None</pictures></record>

I just moved to Modesto and discovered the Senior Center.  I signed up for bingo and the computer classes and couldn't be happier.  The people and staff are very friendly and helpful. The computer instructors are very knowledgeable and patient.</Review>

Modesto Senior Citizens Center is where the Forever Young dance club meets every Tuesday morning at 10:00 AM till noon for dancing. Coffee and tea are available. There are usually some snacks brought in by various members. Music is by a live 3 piece country western band. Usually, there is also a Friday night dance once a month.< /Text>

Walked in and was instantly greeted. Had two people ahead of me and waited for about 20ms. I could tell that the gentleman and lady were being meticulous while giving their customers their haircut. I was kind of vague in what I really wanted but the gentleman knew exactly what I was truly asking for. I am throughly pleased with the new style and how he took his time to make sure it was perfect. 18 dollars and I liked it so much I left him with 25.</Text>

This pho place was a lot nicer and cleaner than most I've been to. The restaurant was decently sized and there was even a bar. I used a yelp deal and got Cajun garlic truffle fries with my pho tai (rare steak). There were so many different flavored fries! I love that these fries were thin and crispy. The ones I got were kind of spicy but there were other flavors you could have gotten too! I chose the Cajun garlic truffle because they were literally all the flavors I love on my fries and I've NEVER seen fries with all three seasonings!! I would come back just for the fries. You could just order the fries for $3 also.

I was hungry so I got the pho. The meat was pretty tough but I'm not sure if it was just my pho or if it's normally like that. I honestly think the fries are better than the pho... but I have a bias towards fries as you can tell. Overall, I would come here again to eat</Text>

<Text>I came by at 805 pm today and asked if I wanted a booth or to sit at the bar as I was alone.
I requested a booth which was cleared and cleaned.
I have been here before at the opening ing by the way but have stayed away due to past poor treatment towards my date in the past.

Tonite the place was about half full.

I too my seat after it was cleared and set to read while waiting.
After reading all the letters to the editor and the main editorial article I still had no menu.

I got up and left and obviously not missed at the staff was bending over backwards to thier Asian customers leaving me to be ignored, and from the comments if another guest try to get service he and his wife also.

I had came here as normally the food is good and it is close and open Wednesday which the far better Saigon District is not.
So I had bun’ at a place on brook gust and talbert.

That is another story.

Too bad this place is limiting itself.
Viet food is very popular among non Asians in OC. The restauranteurs should see this by now.<//Text>< pics>

Excellent food and service! The shaken beef was the tastiest that I've had here in orange county. The pho broth was also very good.</text>

We stopped by for tea in the afternoon and ended up going back for dinner.  Both were great. We all pretty much got the pho tai bowels and loved them.<//Text>

I went with my family at around 2pm today and it was really empty. We were the only ones there. The pho came out in a timely matter. It was pretty delicious and it is a few dollars cheaper than most pho places. Flavorful broth. Good service. Only complaint is that they don't give a lot of meat, but it's alright since the price kind of reflects that. They also give you free dessert afterwards, today it was a sweet tapioca pudding. Would like to come back again.</text>

<text>I have never had a better bowl of Pho.
I chose the rare filet mignon.
Delicious !
The staff is very nice and I felt right at home.
I tried the "Rocket Shrimp" appetizer and was very happy with them. Crunchy, light, and flavorful.
I can't wait to go back and try more items on their menu.
Couldn't be happier with the food and service.😎</text><username>Gene Sinner<//username>< pictures>

Staff are very courteous and professional
Waiting time is short
Procedures are explained in details and the doctor makes his recommendation
Fees are surprisingly reasonable

Do yourself a favor and don’t look for others!!!</Text>

I’m satisfied with the treatment that I got. The doctor is pretty intuitive . Most importantly there is no over bleeding like other dentists. And no pain.</Review>

<Text>One of the best dentists I’ve beet at Beni the dentist is an amazing person very humble including the staff.
Very professional and carrying I already recommended to 10s of people if not more .
Also his prices are lower then other dentist I’ve been going to in the past . I did root canals and cavities and also two implants which I am very happy and my wife really impressed with the work compared to her dentist she used to go to before therefore I strongly recommend this dentistry to all. Thank got for leading me to this dentist and the staff .</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Very nice kind and smiling all staff
Will kindly answer all your questions
The shop is very clean and  the doctor  is so professional with two right and blessed hands I didn’t feel any pain and I just had root canal last week and today he pulled  my wisdom tooth out and Although people say it’s so much pain didn’t feel any pain and it took him less than 15 minutes to pull it out
Thank you Winnetka dentistry unfortunately I will be back soon for more!!!!
Great experience as far as it could get!!!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Went today for a regular cleaning and Beni suggested that i need deep cleaning since my teeth and gum weren't in a really good condition.
I decided to do it , one of his workers did the deep cleaning.
When i checked my teeth after she was done there were some parts that still weren't clean , when i told her about she said it's the color of the teeth , which is absurd!
I insisted and she had to polish my teeth two more times to do it right!
Needless to say it wasn't deep cleaning , it was my first time doing it and i read about it online later and deep cleaning takes much longer than 30 minutes.
Do not go near this place , highly unprofessional and also they lie to you!
I feel like i was scammed , BEWARE!<//text>

Wow! China's Ally in Porterville was on their game tonight! It was great! We had shredded beef crispy tacos, chilli rellenos with verde sauce, and cheese enchiladas. The rice and beans are amazing too--I'm so glad they have not succumbed to the "frozen mixed vegetables added" trend. Had the signature french dressing, hot sauce and dip! Thanks for doing it right all these years, we look forward to our annual visits! All the best for an amazing new year!<//text>

<Text>First my order was wrong but they wouldn't know because Vanessa never checked to see how we were doing. Then Vanessa brought only 3 napkins for a table of 4, which one of the napkins had chewed gum in it. When this was brought to her attention she said it wasn't from them and we had to of put it there. She was rude and very unpersonable. No thank you or have a good day. Really disappointed with interaction with staff.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

The food was greasy and the orders were all mixed up and the waitress was real slow and seemed to care less about you. Not gonna go back.

<time>1612695745397<//time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>We have been going to Goodwill outlets for over 10 years and seen about everything. Oxnard outlet has always been interesting and there’s cool stuff if you are patient. It’s been exceptionally better because new manager James has this place running better than I ever seen. It’s clean and orderly and he has bins come more regularly. He has made the Goodwill outlet a great place to be. New manager is the best. Thank you Goodwill.</review>< pictures>

<text>I really like this place excellent place to find treasures. However I hate how the resellers just hang out in the parking lot all day long. They are the first ones on the list for new items and none of them practice social distancing. I feel like they should limit the amount of times someone gets put on that list to 2x a day.< /text><userid>111905411236309028342</userid>< Pics>

This is a warehouse environment with a thrift store theme. Lots of good stuff ranging from EVERYTHING, clothes, furniture, electronics, toys and more. Best to get there early because there are professional junkers who visit and buy up all the good stuff. There is a competitive feeling here as a shopper by other shoppers. The staff is very nice. Everything is sold by gross weight and payment is CASH-ONLY.</Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>To whom this may concern,

Are you aware that the manager for the goodwill wholesale outlet last night, 05/24/2018 is losing money and customers due to how she treats paying customers?

During closing while at least 10 + people were in line with full carts waiting to pay, the manager comes to the middle of the line where I was and says that the man in front of me will most likely be the last one that can purchase items. This made not only all of the people behind me unhappy, but also made me feel like she was cutting off in front of me for prejudice reasons.

In all of the years I have been a loyal client of goodwill, I have never waited in a line after looking through items and bins for 90+ minutes just to be told that I won't even have the chance to pay.

What made this extremely unfair to your clients and overall a poor way of doing business is:

- only one register was open and the manager was not helping the only cashier to speed up the process

- manager argued with customer's that were weighing items and was limiting time for everyone else

- instead of standing at end of line and announcing that where she stands is the end of line and no one else after her to allow the customers that had already been in line the chance to purchase their items, she targets the customers that have been standing and waiting in line and tells us that we are wasting our time.

I had put a lot of energy into finding the items I wanted to purchase and my arms were tired from the time I spent in your store to find them.

Your employee had been short, cold, and lacks the proper customer service skills that a manager for your company should have. I have never seen a business run this way. The potential customers that she refused to ring up had enough items to easily match or surpass the cashiers and manager pay for that day.

I am very disappointed with how your goodwill manager treats potential clients.< /Review>< Pictures>

They don't let anyone under the age of 18 inside and they make them wait outside while their parents are checking inside. They don't let anyone in under the age of 18 because of "accidents" that happen. Me and my sister are outside and we are always with our mom and we don't move from her side. They are making us stay outside. I could be at home finishing my homework but my mom deciede to take us. If you have children or anyone under the age of 18 take someone with you for them to be able to leave them outside or just leave them at home with someone you trust.</Text>

<Text>This place is pretty cool. They have a really good selection of everything from home goods and decor to clothes for everyone. They charge by weight. I got a putter, video camera, surfboard leash and gloves, clothes and accessories too. All for less than 10 bucks! The only thing I can think of to gripe about are the shoes... When I find one I like, I can't ever find the other! When I mentioned it during checkout, the employee just blamed the customers. I wonder why this store can't just keep each pair together with a rubber band? Like how every other Goodwill Store I've been to does?<//Text>< Pictures>

LOOK SOME OF THE OF THE WORKERS ARE unprofessional and should not be working there.   But what crazy is they have people their that are in there all day long .. With a truck parked right out front.  and these one guy is crazy pushing people and sh##   ....  The must be a better way to handle how people can shop ...  There should not be one or three people using the Goodwill Store like their own personal cheap discount (buy good sh## and resale sale in their personal stores..."  come on you have to know when you see then hauling all the good stuff up out of there everything ???   THAT JUST WRONG AND IT SCARY WHO GOING TO GO UP AGAINST THAT ONE BIG GUY IN THERE WITH 5-6 SHOPING CARTS?< /Text>

Most of the swag gets swallowed up by the resellers, who LITTERALY run and push and swarm over new bins as soon as they're allowed. Good luck finding a cart too, because each of those guys has 10 along the wall full of stuff. Guessing goodwill isn't too bothered by them since I'm sure they spend alot more than I do. But all that said, I've been lucky enough to find some pretty awesome stuff, so I still go back every now and the to deal with those year round black Friday shoppers.< /text>< Pictures>

This place is great.  Ugh, I get addicted, I wish I didn't work so close.
Basically they have a bunch of stuff that the other goodwills don't have room for and they throw everything in giant. . Bins?
You rummage through and when you're done- they weigh it.  Shoes / clothes are $1.50/pound and 'hard goods' like toys, movies, misc, and books are $0.50 a pound.
Yes,  there's a lot of junk but you can find awesome things and even brand new stuff.

I found a $200 chiropractic back massager for $3. Tons of new with tags clothes for less that's a dollar.  Just tons of nice things.

BUT the people will basically run you down to beat you two things, so I end up getting the leftovers because I don't want to fight for it. Otherwise it's great and the staff is a lot more friendly than they used to be<//Review>

<text>Is a great place to shop, but I will not be attending the store anymore  the reason is this so call manager who lacks the leadership of a real leader does, she is very rude to customers , favorites customers this is pathetic the way they allow someone like that to represent their company . I will be filling a complain with corporate office , what ever happened to having respect. If anyone feels the same way please we have rights as customers and let's put a stop to this uneducated woman who's in the wrong place.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>This outlet is ok. They have stricter rules than the other outlets I've been too. No kids allowed and you must stay behind the yellow line when new bins are brought out. And they will yell at u if u don't listen! Just fyi 😁 ppl are pretty savage just like at most of the bins I've gone to.

The store itself is awesome, the people who shop there act like psycho maniacs, stomping over people, pushing, shoving and elbowing others when the employees bring out a new bin. You'd think they never saw used clothes and junk before.  Savages.< /text>

I go there but right now they aren't providing as many rolling sorting bins. Broken glass...clothes mixed with hard goods. Hard goods used to be separate. Don't like all the big brown boxes. Hard to see or get to stuff. Too much trash that should be removed too.</review>

Terrible workers with amazingly trashy attitudes. They need to hire a whole lot of new people and redo the entire place. I'd go in the negatives with rating if possible never go here. Espevially if you have a child and decide to bring them they will kick you out< /Text>

This place is very dirty, they don't let children in, they will not even let them you the restroom, your cart will get dumped with personal belongings, the customers fight, but the employees are rude and will yell at you I wish I could give 0 stars but go there leave with fleas or dirt in lungs</Text>

< review>
Like many of us in the Bay Area, we’re in one of the post war building boom homes built in the late 50’s. The roof design of many of these these homes have the rafters extending so far out the edge that they block quite a bit of sunlight coming through the windows, leaving the homes dark and dreary inside. These solar tubes are wonderful in that they require minimal cuts in your roof and ceiling, compared to traditional skylights, preserving the integrity of your roof. The light they produce is on par with a traditional skylight. The added benefit of solar night lights, plus the ability to add a light fixture for lighting the area at night, makes this an all around solution for lighting those dark areas in these older homes.

The installation team was very nice, professional, and was in and out in 90 minutes. I look forward to their installing more of these light in my home.< /review>

<text>The staff is very helpful and friendly! The products are very energy efficient which can help you save lots of money on your energy bill.
We already have 5 SolaTubes and are planning to buy 3 more. A single SolaTube lights up one hallway all day even if the sun is behind clouds. We only have to turn on lights after dark!<//text>< Pics>

<review>The sun lights brighten our home! Our little townhouse is small but with these amazing ceiling “windows” our home is a breath of fresh air and feels bigger. We installed one in every bathroom and in our vaulted ceiling in the stairwell. Wow!

Fast service and turn around on this project makes it a no brainer. In and out in under a few hours!< /review></record></dataset><record>

I asked for pictures of the roof and attic installs and I got what I needed. The light is strong and on the blueish side , because of the metallic tube involved. They (2) worked were very fast 1-1.5 hours. Hopefully the work and materials will stand up to the upcoming California rains and wind, a 5 year workmanship warranty is apparently included in the price.
Seems to be a well done job.<//text><user_name>Peter Iovan< /user_name>< Pics>

<review>I purchased seven solar tubes from Sunlight Concepts while remodeling a 1980s house. The increased sunlight transformed its livability. The best value was bringing light into a downstairs "family room" that had no windows due to an old addition. I had SC run the tubes through closets in the upstairs bedrooms, then added more closet space later. It transformed the heart of the house. The additional light has made dark unattractive areas appealing and useful, so the house feels larger now.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I had two solar tubes installed. One in the living room and the other in the hall way.
The one in the living room was positioned toward the back of the wall, and away
from the front window.  The results were spectacular.  As the sun's light diminished in the afternoon, the back part of living room would become dismally dimmed.  Now it remains well lit until the evening.  The hall way was always a dark corridor.  Now light is spread evenly throughout the hall way.  I also had a solar exhaust fan installed in the attic to help fan out the build up of hot air during the hot days of summer. As for the job, the team projected a professional demeanor and they were able to complete the whole process in less than 2 hours.  They were also immaculate in ensuring that they protected furnishings as well as tidy up after they completed the job.<//text>

The Sunlight Concepts' installers arrived at our home 1/2-hour earlier than scheduled!   They were very knowledgeable about the products and answered all of my questions.

The original plan was to have 2-"1600" solar powered attic fans installed on our roof.  When one of the installers suggested that I have an additional "1200" solar powered attic fan installed on our garage roof, I happily agreed as the garage faces the afternoon sun and gets very warm inside, during the summer months!  I also opted to have  thermostat controls wired into the fans' circuits, so the fans will not operate when the ambient temperature in the attic is less than 85 degrees.  (The thermostats will prolong the life of the fan motors.)  Even with the installation of the additional fan and the thermostat controls, the installers completed the install in less than 45 minutes.  They cleaned up all of the debris and took away all of the packaging materials.  The installers were very polite and did an excellent job in the installations.

From the front of the house, I can only see a small portion of a fan housing peeking over the ridge of the roof.  The other 2-fans are hidden from street-view.  We didn't have very  many hot days this past summer, but during the few warm days, our house remained comfortably cool.  The garage and laundry room were noticeably cooler than in past years!  The 2-attic fans over the living space of our home can not be heard while operating.  Even the fan on the garage roof is very quiet and I can see the bottom of the fan housing and the spinning blades, from inside the garage.</text>

<review>I purchased several solar tubes from here. Great showroom to give you an idea of the light. The final product in my remodel looks great. The different diffuser options are a nice touch as well. The tube technology is fantastic - very vibrant compared other competitive products.

<Text>We purchased 2 solar tubes from Sunlight concepts for our kitchen (and our contractor installed them). They have changed the kitchen completely in terms of lighting, which is amazing now ! I did some research and sunlight concepts has the largest selection (and best quality) solar tubes.

We also installed 2 solar powered attic fans (from Sunlight Concepts) to cool down the attic in the summer.

Highly recommend Sunlight Concepts and their products !< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<rating>5<//rating><review>The installers & personnel in general were all articulate and efficient and the price seemed right.  We bought 3 of these about a year ago, 1 each for 2 hallways and 1 for a bathroom, and they totally transform these areas from smelly-looking to immaculate-deception.   Very good... it actually makes you WANT to drag out the mop... just to honor the beautiful light.  I attached a photo, shows one of the hallways (yellow gymnastic rings hanging from door on right) - this is so you can see the brightness of the light...is the 9" diameter solatube.  Note the light has a bluish feel... more in platinum territory than in golden... but I like this.   It may feel overly bright or unnatural to some... so if you are worried, check out the showroom first.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I have purchased 6 solatubes at different times for my home from Sunlight Concepts.  They have always done a great job, including cleanup, and they offer a good quality product.  I love the light my sun tunnels provide.  I highly recommend Sunlight Concepts if you're considering solutions to get more light in your home.<//Text>

I'm thrilled with my solartubes.  I had four installed and it really brightened up my home.
I have one in my office, one in the master bathroom and two in my living room.
The installer really knew what he was doing and everything was finished in one day.
My home is so lit up now, I sometimes think I forgot to turn of the lights.< /text>

My wife and I purchased three Solatubes from Sunlight Concepts when we remodeled our house two years ago.  Seeing the products in the showroom really helped in choosing which models to get.  All three have done a great job for us brightening otherwise dark areas of our house.  This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it.<//Review>

<Review>We had 3 solatubes installed in our long bedroom wing hallway. It was so dark before - and we don't like leaving the lights on! This made all the difference!  Our installer was just great - he was careful with the installation and pleasant to work with. We're trying to assess where else we might install them. We had a good experience!< /Review>< date>

We purchased nine solatubes from Sunlight Concepts. Each has transformed the space into which it's installed by bathing it in natural light. I still sometimes glance into one of the solatube rooms and head towards the doorway thinking someone has left a light burning. The staff were helpful. The products were flawless. The results are spectacular!< /review>

This is our go to supplier for solartubes.  They know what they are talking about and can supply us with the materials and expertise that we need to do our jobs right.  Why would you go anywhere else.</Review>

We had our 3 Solar tubes (Solatube system) installed by Sunlight Concepts yesterday and the result is amazing. In a couple of hours, the second story of our home went from gloomy to bright. I kind of knew that we would have more light, but the result goes far beyond. It totally changed the atmosphere of our home, making it cheerful, happy, more comfortable and welcoming. The natural light reclaimed the entire space of our home, suppressing the dark areas and making the rooms look larger.

We are very happy with our experience. We started by visiting the Sunlight Concepts show room and met Marjorie, the Business Manager. Marjorie was great at answering all our questions. We met later on the Executive Manager and one of their installers for the complimentary home visit and were again impressed by their level of professionalism and courtesy. Then, we had finally 2 technicians installing the solar tubes yesterday and everything went very smoothly. These guys definitely  know what they are doing. Plus, they are very punctual.

We also chose Sunlight Concepts because of their experience working with HOA's. In our case, they had to work their schedule around the schedule of the company in charge of our re-roofing project, which was not always an easy task. However, they remained very accommodating and dedicated to their customers throughout the process.

Even though you can buy the product and install it yourselves, it did not seem an easy task to us, at least if one want to make sure that they get the optimal result from their investment. Just saying.

I had a virtual session with Coach Dan that was wonderful! I got a great workout that helped me feel strong and more aware of what my body is capable of. Coach Dan made it possible to do everything from home without the need to buy any equipment - making this the most accessible and enjoyable workout I have a had in the last few months! I highly recommend Coach Dan and Perform For Life!</text>

I trained with Anthony N. for 6 months and had the best experience at Perform For Life. Prior to starting, I had been recovering from a series of injuries to both my lower and upper half of my body, so I was a out of shape and had only finished my Physical Therapy a few months prior. After completing the assessment, I was paired up with Anthony N. who had also suffered from a shoulder injury before - and was well equipped with in his expertise on how to get my mobility and strength back. Anthony took his time with me, and was careful to not overwork certain problem areas until my body could handle it. This is not to say Anthony went easy on me when I did have the strength, but I appreciate Anthony's patience in allowing my body to grow at a safe pace. I highly recommend Perform For Life (regardless of the location) if you are somehow who is looking for an intimate training session with a knowledgeable fitness specialist, or looking for a small group training class that is not 30+ people piled into a room.

Lastly, the gym plays great music! I know music is subjective, but it's not just top 100s on repeat every single day. Some gyms in the city will just play the same station every single week, and it gets tiring to hear. Good music does wonders for a workout session.

Thanks for all the hard work Anthony! You've made me a stronger person because of it. Thank You P4L!</Text>

You can make it as challenging as you need, with a max 8 people he’ll guide you to do the exercises correctly.  There are regulars to the class, and seeing the great fun people in my classes makes working out something to look forward to!

It was my second time taking a group exercise class with Perform For Life, but my first time taking a Small Group Class at this location. I took the class with Coach Jon and it was definitely one of the sweatiest classes that I've been to. He went through all of the exercises clearly before we began each circuit. The exercises made my muscles burn-in a good way, and by the end of the class I was ready to just lie on the floor. Coach Jon is funny and engaging with the rest of the class and encourages each person to do their best. While I haven't taken many classes at P4L, it's clear that he wants us to know that everybody at P4L is a part of the family.</Text>

I live between P4L gyms on Mission|Castro and FIDI. I like this one better because of coach Garrett. I change my schedule to make sure that I can attend his class. He is new coach but he goes extra mile to make sure that you perform exercise correctly. He also experiments with routine to find what will fit better for specific group. I definitely recommend P4L gyms to anyone who wants to stay fit and healthy.< /review>

By far the best small group class I have taken in SF! I am always traveling so it is hard to find a gym with classes that run all day. The location is a nice size and has a nostalgic feel to it. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a personal training studio that feels like home.</review>

i LOVE this place! The owners are the best part because they created such an awesome environment to work out in..but it is more than just a gym it's a place to grow and learn what your body is capable of doing! My coach Charles is worth every penny and more! He has been gentle yet firm to push me to do the best i can! I highly recommend!
You will have no regrets except not having known about them sooner!

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Almost 4 years later this is my second home. With my continuous struggle of scoliosis I decided to enhance my life with adding one on one trainings at P4L. I avidly did the shared personal training sessions which was and still is exhilarating, effective, and powerful. My choice to get one to one personal training was to hone in on getting a better quality of life and really getting the help to find exercises to enhance my performance. Cheri has been my personal trainer for almost a year now and I am extremely fascinated by her technique and ability to scientifically find exercises that have really enhanced my life. She is extremely educated, present, & filled with knowledge. Every session I feel stronger, challenged, and supported. She is tactful and really takes the time to curate the best movements and techniques to make me stronger. Best decision I have made to take care of myself more.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I did group exercise classes for a few months here. The gym was too small for me. The size really limited the amount of different exercises one could do so you were doing pretty much the same workouts every week. The classes were also too crowded when they were full and often the classes you wanted would fill up before you could get a spot. The coaching was ok given their constraints though.<//Text>

< Review>
The P4L staff go out of their way to make the complex, simple. Over a year ago I walked in with a complex goal of losing weight, getting stronger, being more flexible, and finding a regular routine I would commit to. That's a pretty complex ask. They simplified it, into a series of personal and group tasks. My coach, Austin, made our 1 on 1 sessions a place to mark incremental progress, tracking gradual increases in weights and reps to keep me motivated. Taking classes between sessions kept the momentum up while bringing a lot cardio into the strength building. And with so many different instructors with different styles--Melissa, Charles, Amber, Anthony--it stays fresh and different. In six months P4L has met and exceeded my expectations. I'm very thankful for such a engaged and dedicated staff</Review>

I went to P4L to have my run labs done and would highly recommend for anyone looking to take their fitness to the next level. I have been a competitive athlete for 15 years and continue to compete at a high level in amateur Muay Thai. Getting my run labs done was an awesome way to pinpoint specific areas in my physical fitness that I could work on to make gains in my overall performance and how to stay healthy for the future. Walking in, this place has a great energy and you can tell that there is a personal relationship with the trainers and their clients. I worked with Pita and Maddie during the 2 hour labs that we did which included checking flexibility, stabilizer muscles, analyzing my gate and VO2 max amongst other things.  They use cutting edge technology and video to help provide you with visuals. They are easy to work with and we laughed the whole time. At the end of the session, I left feeling happy and uplifted even though these were people that I had just met.  Even if you are just starting to get into sports/exercise, this is a great test to get your baseline fitness and help identify goals moving forward. Thank you P4L! :)< /Review>

Perform For Life has been an important part of my life since they opened their doors. P4L definitely pushed me to be healthier and the results followed. However, the P4L crew is what makes this gym special, we are family and have fun! All the  personal trainers are awesome and meet the needs of all members plus their small group classes are great. Try out a personal session or a small class, you’ll be a convert just like me!</text>

Their approach to getting the benefits of exercising without killing yourself in the process is truly effective. I love the music too. Oh and that body assessment machine is phenomenal. Thank you P4L

The entire staff at P4L is so welcoming and awesome to work with! Small Group training is always challenging and fun!

I trained with Charles for three months to prep for my wedding and it was the best choice I could have made!  Charles has a great way of pushing me to do things that I would never do working out on my own, while also helping to understand the mechanics and the reason why I am doing the exercises.  Charles' laid back attitude and calming presence makes workouts fly by.   He consistently listened to the exercises I enjoyed and helped to tailor my workouts to the things I enjoyed.

Most importantly, I can see a huge difference in my strength and body composition since starting to work with Charles.  I had particular areas that I wanted to target for my wedding dress - Charles not only improved those areas but also improved my entire body.  He paid attention to my body composition and my strengths and weaknesses and worked to improve those.<//Text>

Coaches at P4L are really knowledgeable when it comes to treating your body right, conditioning, training etc...  I love the gym atmosphere, everyone is really supportive. I’ve taken boxing and strength/conditioning classes. Coach B instructs you through rigorous boxing workouts, I would recommend this class to anyone. Coach Charles instructed me through one of the hardest workouts after a long day at work. If you want to relieve some stress take one or both of these classes, they will not disappoint. Keep up the good work P4L Coaches!✌🏾</text>

I have been working out with Coach Charles and Amber since March. I enjoy the diversity of the workout and their stylistic differences. They are both extremely knowledgeable and push me to achieve things I thought I could not do; however, if I am having a low day due to fatigue or stress they meet me where I am and provide encouragement to help me achieve my goals. The entire group at P4L is awesome and very accommodating!< /review>

Hands down, P4L is the best gym & personal training experience I've ever had. Not only are the classes fun and challenging, but they are small enough to where you still get individualized attention. The coaches truly do care about their clients and helping them meet their fitness goals. My trainer, Brandon, really pushed me to show up. In fact, I don't think he EVER missed 1 day in the 9 months we trained together! The owners, Bryan and Justine, have really set such a high industry standard that I've yet to see in any other gym. Not only are all of the coaches knowledgable and constantly learning about topics in their industry, but it's evident that they are passionate about their work. This isn't just "a job" that they show up to (sadly, like most gym trainers I've had). It's a lifestyle that they are excited and committed to, and they're passionate about getting other people to love fitness. My favorite thing about Perform for Life is the community that they've built - Bryant and Justine, along with all of the coaches and even the clients!, are all so kind and genuine. Look no further - THIS is IT!< /Text>

As a former college baseball player and avid activity thrill seeker, P4L’s softball league was exactly what I needed. I felt a little apprehensive at first when I got the invite, due to the fact that I didn’t know anyone involved with P4L, but as soon as I was surrounded by the community built by P4L I was sold! It was such a great season! The people were amazing! No judgment! No trash talk! No bullies! A space to be comfortable in your own skin while enjoying the practice of life long healthy living ... Thank you, P4L!<//Review>

I've been doing the group training classes for about a month now at P4L and I wish I had started earlier!  I already feel and look way more fit and I've noticed I'm more energetic and focused throughout the day.

I've had group training classes with Charles, Nathan, Amber, and Anthony so far.  They all are very welcoming and they bring their own individual personality and fitness background to their classes. The group sessions offer a HIIT interval training style with a combination of body weight exercises, free weights, and stretching.

If you're looking for a fun and rewarding way to jump-start your  physical activity level, I highly recommend trying this place out!

<review>Best. Gym. Ever. I've been training at Perform for Life on and off for nearly three years. Recently, I've been working with trainer Michael Phillips, trying to improve my weight lifting numbers. Michael has done an amazing job of providing structure to my workouts and helping me see major gains in all of the big lifts (deadlift, squat, bench press). Everyone at the gym is incredibly knowledgeable in all things fitness, and they apply this knowledge in practical ways to help improve your form, prevent injuries, and see big gains. I'd recommend personal training at P4L without reservation for anyone who has hit a plateau in their fitness journey and need that extra push to take things to the next level.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>I love everything about the P4L community. These days the title personal trainer does not mean too much, however the trainers at Perform for Life are indeed Movement Specialists. They take a personal approach by listening to your goals, doing an assessment, and help get you moving in the right direction. Plus, their community events are a blast. While P4L is not my primary gym, I still look to their faculties for my training and health approach. Appreciate you guys!< /text>< Rating>

My fiance and I have been doing the small group classes here for a few months and it is awesome! I used to do crossfit, but this is a much more sustainable approach to working out (and life). They focus a lot on the core, which is great for someone like me with lower back problems. Coach Charles is the man and coach Melissa will kick your butt! Enjoy!< /review>

I want to single out Coach Eva, she’s awesome. She started an Olympic lifting program from the ground up at this gym that is definitely the reason I keep coming. We have a cool mini-community with people on the same wavelength wanting to move more weight around and do more explosive movements than the small group classes allow with how many people are in them. It’s an awesome way to be able to track measured progress of performance in a way that’s more engaging for me than worrying about numbers on a scale. Only reason for the loss of the star is because it seems like management is getting a little dicey with the scheduling of the oly classes. Built out a new location that’s perfect for it with platforms and everything, put oly classes on the schedule then cut them a couple days later with no notice. Seems like it’s short circuiting a really cool aspect of this gym that was starting to grow. These classes are literally the reason I come and it’s rough to see them deprioritized like this.</Review>< Pictures>

I live in San Jose and travel to perform for life to get an intense workout with all their coaches.  It's an amazing experience every time, they pay attention to my form during each exercise and motivate me to be my best.  I have become stronger, more flexible, and more in tuned with my body.  Their workouts also target muscles I don't usually focus on when I'm by myself and improve on everyday movements.  They have a great team who are friendly, professional, and FUN FUN FUN!!!  I look forward to my workout every time.  Thank you P4L!!!!<//review>

<Review>It's been exactly one year since I started personal training sessions at Perform For Life and I'm so happy I found this place! I started out seeing Amber 2x a week and now see her only 1x a week. Amber goes above and beyond and makes sure I'm also exercising and maintaining a healthy lifestyle out of our sessions. She'll even go so far as creating workouts for me on days I am not at P4L. The P4L fam is the best. Thanks!</Review>< Pics>

<review>The trainers at P4L are all well trained and great at what they do.  I went there for a few years and it felt like such a welcoming community.  When I started going, I hadn’t been to a gym in years, was in my late 30’s and very overweight.  In the time I went to P4L, I lost about 40 pounds and gained a new family!</review>< Pics>

These are legit personal trainers. I met the owner Bryant who has the background and  knowledge to help get me physically to the next level for my golf game. Titleist Performance Institute Certified. We spent the first hour screening my movement which gave him a clear roadmap  for me. Five star!<//Text>

P4L is a family.  There is an amazing relationship between customers, owners, and staff.  I feel like my trainers listen and respect me.  I feel they listen and adjust the planned routine (in real time) to any pain I feel.  They also know when I am just whining or killing time.  My trainer even bought me wedding gifts (a miniature foam roller and lacrosse ball to take on my honeymoon).</Review>

I've been attending small group fitness classes for 5 months and I am the strongest I've ever been. All the coaches are motivating and genuinely kind people. The weekday morning classes are a great mix of body weight, dumbbell, kettle bell, and TRX training - with some HIIT thrown in. The coaches are also always working to improve the gym - open to suggestions and critiques. Love P4L!</text>

<rate>5<//rate><text>I absolutely love Perform For Life!! The best decision I made to further my boxing career was to step inside of this amazing gym.

The energy once you step inside is GREAT and very WELCOMING. The entire staff as a whole makes it a very comfortable and great place to be. I've been going to a cooperate gym since 2005 and I got use to seeing personal trainers usually just sitting there on their phones while watching the client work, looking very uninterested, not engaged and basically the trainer just looks like he/she is going through things out of a book. Not here at Perform for Life. The specialist here not only look the part but they are fully engaged with their individual client. That goes for the group classes as well. I usually go to Charles's Friday morning group session and it's best group fitness class I've ever taken. With it being a small group setting it makes itnintimate to where you would get lost in the shuffle within those super huge fitneas classes and would be doing an exercise completely wrong and might even hurt yourself in the process.

Outside of the fitness spectrum, I love the fact that Perform for Life GIVES BACK. They volunteer their time at Glide Memorial, I see that they give back to the youth and they are for the community. The shows a lot of integrity and who they are not just as a gym but as a people. A place like that will always have my business and support.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1502913849594, 'text': 'Wowwww, these kind words gave us goosebumps!

< review>
I can full full-hardheartedly say that Perform for Life opened my eyes to a whole new world of not only exercise but an all encompassing work out. For years I became a creature of habit and continued to do exercises that were not producing results and in the end unfortunately creating injuries & discomfort to no end where I felt I was going to give up. Through training with Bryant & Justine not only have I become stronger, leaner, and got my groove back, I was given the confidence that I can do anything. My body has seen results that I never thought was possible because the founders have the capability & intuition to provide an all encompassing workout that will make you the best version of yourself. Their amount of knowledge is insane and their ability to be personable makes you feel like you have known them for ever. Every time I walk into P4L I am filled with such high energy and every time I walk out I feel like I achieved a new milestone.</review>

< Review>
During 2016 I had four gyms, Perform For Life is the best! PFL is a unique combination of talent and community that combines to make it the best experience in SF.

All of the trainers teaching all of the classes and doing private sessions have kinesiology degrees. You won't find this background at your other local gyms. The owners work hard to provide the best product wrapped in awesome customer service, love, and community. This is a great place to meet and foster friendships while achieving your personal best. I cannot recommend them enough. I've worked with almost all of the trainers and all are amazing. I think you'll be impressed.< /Review>

<Text>P4L definitely brands its name in family and hard work. Once a part of the gym, you have found yourself a family... a fit fam. Couldn't reach goals and make reaching them fun without the direction and support of this fam!</Text>< pictures>

<Text>Recently I told Amber how pleased I was with our work together.  Through my work with her over the months, I have begun to make the transition from a person who had to go to exercise to help improve the odds of keeping my cancer in check, to a person who is beginning to think of exercise as a part of my personality and a valued lifestyle choice.
Amber shows unusual skill in gauging the exercises to my ability.  It often seems as if she starts a set of exercises with a low-ball warm-up resistance.  In subsequent sets I get to request more weight.  That experience of wanting to do more, to work harder is, for me, a unique experience around exercise.   By low-balling resistance and working up, Amber models and teaches a kind of patience that I had never associated with exercise and allows me to experience a quite novel experience in myself of eagerness around exercise combined with patience about the results.  Despite my impatience with her cautious approach, I often wind up feeling manageable muscle soreness after workouts which makes me feel just a bit of the self-righteous and heroic warrior.

Amber shows unexpected inventiveness in hitting the same basic muscle groups in novel ways as well as a consistency of attention to proper form which is unaccustomed to me.  This keeps my workouts interesting and also works all possible associated peripheral muscles. It also contributes to the impression that she really thinks hard about how to make the workouts interesting and entertaining.  She is also so consistent about monitoring the basics of good body mechanics that I now anticipate the corrections she is about to make.  This makes it easier to integrate our training into my daily activity.  For example, I now experience brisk walking as an exercise in awareness in balancing the demands on my legs and calves with my buttocks and back chain.  When lifting, I remind myself to anchor my lats and pay attention to not over-stressing my shoulder joints.  Over the months, my posture has greatly improved, and friends tell me that I am looking much stronger.

Amber is unexpectedly organized in the way that she presents her exercises. She typically starts with warm-ups, presents the main core of our workouts in in sets of 2 or 3 exercises targeting opposing muscle groups, each set repeated three times before moving on to the next set.  She finishes with some playful cool-downs and balance exercises.  This gives me a way to think about the structure of a workout session which has been very helpful to me in beginning to explore working out at home.

Amber's personality and attitudes present a good fit with my personality needs, which has been very helpful in encouraging me to think of exercise as an enjoyable part of my lifestyle.  She is professional about maintaining some distance between her needs and mine, yet not so distant that I don't feel that I have come to know her as a person and feel a sense of her genuine caring and playfulness.  She has skillfully managed all the negative personality traits and unproductive attitudes that I brought to exercise.  For example, each workout she cheerfully and genuinely encourages me to complain about whatever is interfering with my desire to exercise - and then tells me to get going.  She models using one's body with all its limitations as best as one can at the time.  Again and again, I have had the experience of coming in grumpy and unmotivated and leaving feeling energized and successful.  An experienced exerciser may take this for granted, but believe me, this experience is unaccustomed in my life, especially as I have aged and since my cancer treatment.

To the extent possible, I think that Amber brings a quality of broad knowledge, professional attitudes, consistent effort, and playfulness  to our workouts that encourages me to think about my daily activities as potential opportunities to reinforce my workouts and to gladly integrate exercise more deeply into my life.  And that is what Perform for Life is all about.<//Text>< Pics>

I started my fitness journey here at P4L in 2014.They made working out fun for me. Their trainers were great and very knowledgeable, made me feel at ease and safe. I had to leave due to personal reasons but the health and fitness seed that P4L planted in me kept growing. Now I’m finally back, YAY!!!The atmosphere is still the same, warm and inviting. The trainers, there’s more!! Which means different workout routines because no trainer trains the same and I personally love that!! The fact that P4L was always in the back of my mind no matter where I was doing Fitness or falling off, lol, says a lot about P4L. They left a great impression on me and I’m so happy to be back!< /Text>

Bryant and Justine listened to my hesitations about "gym life" and reiterated that P4L fosters a extremely open and non-judgmental culture and is most importantly, fun.

Charles is our PT and is great. He listens to your fitness goals and constructs something that is realistic and challenging, but also enjoyable. So far it's been a great experience and couldn't recommend both P4L and Charles enough. Thanks guys!<//Text>< Gmap_id>

I currently reside in LA, but when I visit SF I always make an effort to work out at P4L w/ Coach Bryant. Bryant conducts full body assessments and suggests helpful modifications for my bilateral tendinitis in my arms. His specialized workouts cater to what my body needs, and I feel safe that I will not further injure myself. I have gained a lot of strength and mobility during our sessions and have continued to follow his regimen here in LA. I would also like to mention that Bryant referred me to Bob, who’s speciality is in Clinical Body Work. Bob helped me tremendously when I had an acute flare up of tendinitis in my achilles. After a session with Bob, I was no longer limping, and my pain decreased drastically. The next time I am in town, I will definitely be training with Coach Bryant! 💪🏻</text>

Having been to many different gyms, P4L has definitely been the best. Feeling comfortable and confident that your trainers really know what they're doing is so important. I have had injury problems for years and have often had issues with trainers at other gyms not giving me the correct exercises based on those injuries. But at P4L, I know that I can trust that they are giving me exercises tailored to me that will only help improve my health and not aggravate my injuries. The few corrective exercises that they've given me thus far have been very helpful for my chronic back pain! Furthermore, going to P4L is always an enjoyable experience because every person is outgoing and friendly. They all make a point to learn your name and ask you about your day. Being a part of P4L is like being a part of a community rather than just being a member of a gym. Perform for Life is 100% deserving of it's #1 rating and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to go to a gym with top notch service and quality!<//review>

<text>My experience with P4L has been exceptional & rewarding so far. I Found out about p4l threw my girlfriend , she  is friends with coach charels, & they went to Sf state together! He had reached out to her trying to get intouch with me cause he had known I compete in mixed martial arts. Finally  I got in contact with coach charels, & I came down one day did my assessment, automatically felt comfortable with everyone, & it was a  good environment to work in. I was able to meet coach Bryant , coach Justine and coach Brandon that same day as well! These guys down here are professionals at what they do!!! They obtain the knowledge to help you with your personal needs, being a professional athlete or even someone who just wants to get in shape. I've never felt more stronger, faster and sharper than I do right now! They really do care for there ppl down here! They assist you in the areas you want to focous on & also make sure your work ethic is up to par. They are there to not only help you, but push you to do better! You come down here it's like one big family everyone working real hard day in day out, everyone says hi to you and bye when they leave, this stuck out to me because I come from traditional martial art school, and this is what they teach respect all your coachs and training partners! This is hands down the best gym in the Bay Area! I been here for 2 fight camps and pulled 2 spectacular performances of my Career thus far, and will be part of the P4L family for a very long time! Coach  Charles Armstrong  and coach Brandon are some beasts foreal! The whole staff are!!! I highly recommend this gym for everyone!!!!</text>< Pictures>

I've come to this gym for the small group classes and I absolutely love them.  One class was led by a resident boxer so we worked on throwing different punches with a partner and boxing-oriented training exercises.  I go here to get a great all-around workout with these small classes.  The different instructors keep things interesting and fresh every time.  They keep a close eye on you ask well to make sure you're doing the exercise right so you don't injure yourself (something the instructors at my climbing gym could learn from since I guess I'm the only one who's not a ripped adonis there).  The atmosphere is SUPER friendly, helpful, and welcoming to all skill and fitness levels.  They have all the equipment and very nice ammenities like a  couple of changing rooms in the back and a full on showah for those of you who get extra Sweaty McSweats before a day at the office. Charles is a pretty dope trainer, too!< /Text>

Does your trainer have a degree in kinesiology? All of the trainers at PFL do. It shows. Every single small group fitness classes is taught by expert trainers who are also available for 1:1 sessions. Once you've hurt yourself at Crossfit or your wallet at Equinox you should come and meet the gorgeous and talented team and local community patrons at PFL. You won't regret it.<//Text>

<Review>Small classes, on average shared a coach with 2-3 people. Routines vary pretty often so hard to get bored, loved the timings of classes, Coach Charles is the bomb when it comes to weight training, high recommend to anyone looking for something in the hood<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
Hi, yesterday I had one of your technicians come and do an oven repair. The repair is fine and the technician was nice. Overall we are very disappointed and feel like we have been taken advantage of. first of all it took 3 times until a technician finally showed up for the appointment. I already knew what the part that was needed and when I made the appointment they said the $89 would go towards labor and this kind of service was about $200. They ended up charging over $400. The part was about $80. I asked how long it would take and he said 15-20min. I asked what the hourly rate was because I was told it would be about $200. He said no hourly rate and that's what we charge. I would have said no but the oven was taken apart and really had no choice. I thought it would be good to let you know to give you a chance to do something about it before I report this an share my experience</Review>

I had to call for a Manager, and have them send a Sears Technician to fix it.  From now on, I will request Sears Technicians only.

To begin, I was lucky enough to purchase a Home Protection plan upon purchasing my Kenmore Elite bottom freezer w/french door fridge.  When making the service appointment, be sure you signify if you have the protection plan.  You will be sent to a "Special Service Tech, I had Memphis who was terrible and did not listen my comments.  I gave him the benefit of doubt and tried his recommendation which didn't help at all.  The first service call had two techs, the one doing the work was training with the trainer there to guide and help if needed.  They diagnosed the problem as being a bad compressor which they had and replaced it and the filter dryer.  The filter dryer wasn't the correct part and wasn't soldered correctly so I had to make second appointment which was simple, Mary was very polite and helpful as before, the second service tech (Kenny) was very knowledgable, he found the problem right away and replaced the filter dryer using the correct part and a very good soldering technique.  Thank you Mary and Kenny!</text>

<Name>Denise Bauer< /Name><date>1592870938716<//date><rating>2</rating><Text>No complaints with repair technician or customer service rep.  Gary was very knowledgeable and professional and efficiently completed the repair.  Nicholas answered my online questions as best as he could and then referred me to another dept to pursue my issue.  My complaint lies with Sears repair policy.  My refrigerator is only 3 years old so replacement parts were still covered by the manufacturer's warranty.  However, the labor charges were over $500. Under the circumstances because of the shortcoming of the original compressor having to be replaced with an upgraded model, I thought it very unfair that I had to bear the brunt of a labor charge for an obviously original defective part.  Then to make matters worse, I discovered that the manufacturer's warranty would only cover the remainder of the time left on my original compressor and not the full 5 years on a new part which does not seem right at all.  Finally the wait time to have the repair completed was 15 days.  For Sears to not be more accommodating on an appliance so necessary and potentially causing lost money on spoiled food was unacceptable.  On the day my refrigerator failed I had just made a huge grocery run and if I hadn't been lucky enough to have the use of a neighbor's refrigerator I would have been out over $500.  Bottom line - individual service people fine, but the reputable and longstanding concern and care for customers is long gone.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dc072a5a9d502f:0x47c5d90122b14876</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

No complaints about the service tech who came out, he was awesome! I was also able to get an appointment quickly, so that was great too

My low rating is for their cost. He was at the house to fix/replace my ice maker. It look 30 minutes...tops. The labor rate was $350! 🤬

<review>My recent dishwasher repair exceeded my expectations in that the repair was completed quicker than expected, all defective parts were replaces as required and when completed, the machine was aligned/balanced better than when it was installed.  So much so that the machine works almost silently.  SEARS repair has always exceeded expectations and in this instance, was a stellar repair effort.

Sears Appliance Repair has gone down hill  in customer service quality. Very disappointed. My refrigerator was not cooling down to a usable temperature. The air handler in the back of my fridge was icing over. My original appointment was on 3/5. The parts took about 3 weeks to show up. I've been living out of coolers and a mini-fridge for 3 weeks. When the repair tech came to my house on 3/30 to install the new parts. It turns out that all the work he did was worthless. The fridge is still too warm and the air handler started to ice over again. Tech support is terrible. You get lost in a maze of computer phone support before you actually get a hold of a human. Very disappointed in the poor customer service to make an appointment. Very disappointed in the workmanship. Tech support didn't care that parts took 3 weeks to show up and didn't care that I was living out of coolers because their parts weren't showing up. It's 4/7 today and I still don't have a working fridge after hundreds of dollars in extended warranties. Get your act together Sears</text>

Have a warranty plan that is to replace unit if Sears can nor fix.  Only good at Sears.  REally great when no Sears store in our county.  Will not give me the money for replacement, only voucher to use at Sears.
Not use this plan unless Sears near your.<//review>

Do not do business with these people. I was told it would cost $100 to come out and diagnose the issue. As long as I had them do the repair, I would receive the $100 back. It's been six months and I'm still fighting them to give me the money back. Don't trust them.

Edit- they reached out and offered to help. I gave them my account information. They have done NOTHING.<//Text>

< Review>
After two 3 house visits a week apart problem still not resolved. Caution you will not be dealing with Sears you'll get a third party repair company know where as qualified as Sears .

The problem is microwave,oven combo  shows "door open". Technician Jim said he had it running but what he says is an un diagnosed  "short" keeps popping the fuse .

I believe is it's the 20 amp barrel fuse . since he didn't have any of those in his truck during his first 7/14/20  3 hour  first visit. Jim left behind his microwave tool box  kit and 2 screws in the microwave.  Armando (remote Tech support) tried to walk him though his first diagnosis but having no fuses prevented him from completion .

We gave Jim his tool box back on the 2nd 7/24/20 visit

Jim's second visit  7/24/20 was the one where, armed with extra fuses, he was apparently able to get to it run for some seconds before fuse pops . It was during that time that Jim left his drill in the microwave oven while he went to his van and he melted the the drill filling the house with acrid smoke. Jim stated he had low blood sugar and had to go to the eat something from his van (this is according to  wife) .

I was with Jim the first visit ,my wife was with Jim the second visit , Had I been there for the for the second visit  I could have kept a better  eye on him .

Jim arrived at 10 a.m and after the filling the house with smoke incident at 1 p.m. the wife told Jim to call it a day as the house guests (Air BnB ) were quite upset  and Jim was back to square one

Something tells me a review of Jim's past repair tickets will revel that  Jim  has some befuddlement issues going on. That and he's constantly talking to himself out loud.    If they send you Jim G good luck wit that.< /Review>

Requested service to a stacked washer dryer combo unit.  One technician was sent to my property and after arrival informed me that he was unable to do assess the repair because he needed a second technician present (despite the fact that I confirmed to him on the phone that it was a stacked unit prior to his arrival).  I was still charged the service fee, which I relunctantly paid.  Thereafter, I received notice of an outstanding invoice.  Contacted customer service who confirmed there was no payment due.  However, I subsequently received another invoice and then notice from a debt collection company.  It's impossible to reach anyone in the billing department to resolve the issue.  I will never use Sears Appliance Repair again and strongly discourage anyone from hiring them.<//review>

The tech was very knowledgeable and worked very efficiently. No mess was left behind. Only bad experience came after when i received constant texts to answer their customer satisfaction survey for each of their separate appointments with this last request for a google review. For that i took off 1 star. Otherwise a 5 star review.</review>

unfortunately this was the third repair I've had with the problem of the fridge heating up since May 2020.  It's still broken and they offered my next appt 5 weeks after the last repair.  They replace parts and then run off saying "give it 2 days" - that's BS - they need to CONFIRM it's working before they disappear.<//text>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>We had difficulty with our KENMORE front Loading washing machine draining. When we bought the washer we paid for a 5-year warranty.  We called SEARS for repair (1-800-4MYHOME). We set up a window of 10am-2pm on a Tuesday for the sub-contracted outside non-SEARS tech to arrive (Euro Appliance Service Inc. in San Diego-DO NOT USE THEM!). I sat waiting from 10am-2pm. No one showed and no one called me. And then spent another 35 minutes on the phone and the chat service with SEARS setting up another SECOND day and time. And NO, SEARS does NOT compensate you for wasting your time! VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE! JUST EXCUSES!

Anyways... We had to set up another appointment with an arrival  window of 1pm-5pm on a Saturday for an actual SEARS tech to arrive. I sat waiting from 1-5pm. Wasted Saturday afternoon. I went online at 4:50pm and called SEARS again to see where the SEARS tech was and when they would arrive! The SEARS tech(Rudy) had called me before to let me know he would now arrive around 5:30pm. The SEARS tech (Rudy) finally showed up at 4:55pm.  The repair of replacing the water pump was completed quickly and efficiently.  Problem solved.  Although,my time that was wasted will NEVER be found again.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1565111736569, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time time to bring this to our attention J.D.

<Rate>2< /Rate><Text>If you are considering having Sears perform maintenance on your washer, specifically the gasket that gets mildew buildup on it, make sure they are able to get it clean. After the tech had finished the job he told me he doesn't know why Sears advertises that they can get the gasket portion clean because he is rarely able to get all the mildew out as the photo on the maintenance section of the website shows.

When I called to get a refund or a credit towards a purchase of a new gasket which I should have done in the first place I was told sorry, there was nothing they could do about it. It's one thing to not do the job that the website shows you can do, but then to not back it up and offer to do the job right or offer a refund is how Sears will never have my business again. Well done Sears...

Update - I have to give Sears credit for reaching out about my experience and offering me a re-try on the cleaning. After a lot of effort in getting a hold of them for a re-do they did send a tech out. He told me that there really was nothing he could do that the tech before him already did. The stains will not come out of the gasket and he said I should probably just purchase a new washer. I appreciated the honesty, I just wish the first tech would have told me that before doing the work and I could have used the $150 charge towards a new machine if nothing could be done as the photos on Sears site shows. I would tell Sears do not advertise a perfectly clean gasket after your service that cannot be achieved.  This is poor form on their part. For the effort I will give them another star. Still very subpar in my opinion.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

The only reason I'm rating the service I received a 2 and not a -10 (negative 10) is because the technician was GREAT!! I took off work for the first company to come out and repair my Kenmore Elite Refrigerator.  He diagnosed it wrong didn't bring any supplies to fix.  Sears scheduled another visit (another day taken off work)  That person didn't show at all,, no call or anything.  The third appointment was scheduled a week or so later for 8am - 12 pm.  I didn't get a call saying person was going to be late.  I called Sears they told me he would be here 11 am - 1pm.  That time came and went I called Sears again.  They said 1:25 pm - 2:25pm.  No call no technician showed.  I called Sears again!  They then told me 6:30pm.  The technician called me and said he would arrive by 7pm.  I called again. (Did I mention this was the third time I missed work?)  Well, the technician didn't arrive to my house until 9pm that night.  It would have been cheaper for me to not purchase the warranty when I purchased the refrigerator.  Missing work for 3 days would have paid for 2 warranties. It would have been cheaper not getting the warranty and just contracting some company on my own to come fix my refrigerator.   I was given the wrong model# for my water filter.  So, now I have to return the one I  bought from Amazon.   Then, the technician gave me another model#, which was not the water filter.  It was the bypass cartridge (not the water filter).  This was the worst service ever.  Not to mention all the time I spent on the phone.<//review>

<Text>The 1st repairman came to find out a problem of my refrigerator, and quoted me $361.69 (with the receipt), his travel fee $99.00 was included. I said YES to repair it. About 1.5 weeks later, another repairman came to repair it, finally he needed $422.89(with the receipt). I told him the previous guy quoted me less than what he asked, he said he did not care what other guy quoted, but I have to pay him the amount he asked today. I was not happy about it, called Sears Appliance Service Center, after I told the customer service guy, he hung up my phone. Bad, bad and bad experience.</Text></record></dataset><record>

I've had a refrigerator warranty for several years and generally service has been OK. Recently, it has been poor. When the unit was under manufacturer's original warranty, actual Sears technicians came out. Under an extended warranty they send various local appliance repair companies. The repair noted on Sears' records for Mar. 26 never took place. No part, no call, no tech, no repair done. I had to initiate action again to push the repair along. Something strange happened here and my confidence in my warranty services is quite low now.<//text>

<Text>Easy to set up a service (I used on-line chat) and even change appointments.  They keep you updated on the timeframe via email, text or phone.  The technicians are knowledgeable.  We needed two calls  to fix our problem dryer - one to diagnose and one to fix - so some miscommunication between the two technicians.  They were polite and ultimately the repair was complete.< /Text><name>patricia waldron</name>< user>

I've been using Sears for 20 years for home warranties/appliance repairs and this was the worst experience ever....

It took 4 different appointments over 2 weeks to get a simple repair resolved.  The 1st appointment to diagnose the issue went fine but we had to wait for 4-5 hours for the tech to arrive.  We then waited for 5 hours on the 2nd appointment only to receive a cancellation from the tech via text/email with no way to contact them.  On the 3rd appointment we waited 4 hours and then received a text that the technician would be there in 30 minutes but he never arrived. Instead he sent us a cancellation and said we were not at home.  He never called and we were home the entire time.  After 30 minutes passed and he still wasn't there we tried calling/texting him multiple times but he never answered.   Just another wasted day waiting for Sears to arrive during their 4 hour window they give you.  The 4th appointment went fine but we had to wait around 4 hours as well for this tech.   If you add it up it took around 15-20 hours of our time over 4 appointments to get a simple repair done!!!!!

In addition to the technicians not showing up Sears has now transferred their call center to India so you can't understand them with their strong dialect and they are totally useless.  And I mean totally useless!  They can't do anything for you when a a problem arises.

I will no longer be using Sears for my home/appliances warranties.  Maybe it has to do with them going bankrupt and restructuring?< /text>

The repairman was amazing!  That's the sad part about Sears now, is they seem to have a lock on all the experienced repairmen but their customer service is sub-par to say the least.  Phone wait times are abysmal, the ability of customer service reps to help is below par, getting anyone at Sears to return a phone call or to actually rectify an issue takes numerous transfers and is close to impossible to the point where I can't even pay my bill, which makes no sense at all.  Only if you are really desperate should you work with Sears. It's a shame, as the repair/installers are quite professional.  And the Service Warranty we wanted to purchase after being offered it for a service discount was a bait and switch.  Sears, please streamline and ameliorate your customer service!!!!! - my wife< /Text>

Hi

I just wanted to let you know that your service has been a severe disappointment. We had our first appointment to fix a Haier washer/dryer unit at the beginning of October. Since then, 3 different technicians have come and ordered the wrong parts. Thus, we have to wait 2 weeks for another's appointment and hope to God that they ordered the correct parts. We've been without a washer/dryer for a month now due to wrong parts being ordered and appointments constantly being rescheduled. Also, some technicians just wouldn't show up. We had an appointment this past Thursday and the technician never showed up. Really disappointing even though the representative 'guaranteed' the unit will be up and running. Next appointment is the 12th. Let's hope they show up, have the correct parts, and don't have to reschedule.<//Review>

I had left my job early - 12.45 pm and waited until almost 6 pm to get the service.

The service repair man was excellent, informative and helpful but the window was much too long.  Happy with the service but do something about the "window"

<text>The repair technician arrived well after the scheduled window of time and while he was knowledgeable and courteous, he didn't have the part needed to repair the drier.  It is a very standard part and my husband had to go out the next day to purchase, then install it himself.  Not sure what the $99. fee was for.  Not a very useful service, especially since we had to wait almost 2 weeks for a technician!< /text>< pics>

My mother had her appliances covered by Sears. I have all appliances, in my home and in my rentals, covered by Sears warranties. Many people have argued that its a waste of money. This is simply not true. Just one major repair pays for all the money spent and saved money in the long run. The convenience and peace of mind knowing excellent specialized repair technicians come when you call and do the job right every time, well what could be better than that.

Last year my Jen Aire gas range igniter went out. The $30.00 part was no longer available for my 15 year old appliance, so they bought me a new $3,200.00 dollar range. Can’t beat that. I’m a believer period. These guys have been at it from the beginning and are simply the best at what they do.</text>

Negative 10 for the worst service ever.  We have had these guys out to our home 5 times in 3 montha to fix our Kenmore Elite . And the fridge is STILL broken.  All the food has gone bad 5 times now, and they take no responsibility. We paid not only for the repair, but also for a diagnostic fee....nothing has been refunded.  PLEASE, dont respond with yet another fake "owner" response.  I know the responses come from their social network monitors, not the owner, and they will never let you get thru to the owner.<//review>

<Text>Our technician arrived within the scheduled time and immediately set to work cleaning out our Kenmore dryer and testing the heating, venting, etc.  He said we needed to get a new lint filter since ours was old and lost the liner, but he recommended we get one through Amazon since it would be a lot cheaper than going through Sears.  I took his advice and ordered it online and got it within a few days and it works perfectly.  I appreciate the fact that he wasn't pushing extra services or work on us.  He worked quickly and efficiently.<//Text>< user_name>

Another appointment was set and the tech arrived to say he needed to order a part  and it would take a little while to get it.  Another appointment was set but the part still hadn't arrived.  When the part came in another appointment was made and the tech arrived to say that the first tech misdiagnosed the problem and another part needed to be ordered.  When that part came in the appointment was made and the tech arrived to fix it.  This house is a rental and my tenants took time off from their jobs to be there.  They missed  many hours of work for the repairs and the appointment which was a no-show.  I believe they are deserving of some compensation.  A gift card would be nice.<//review><Date>1497975179216</Date><pics>None< /pics>< Gmap_id>

<Review>A tech came out first time to fix issue:  thought machine wasn't draining and cold washes were coming out hot.  He cleaned pump (without my permission first) and then said hoses were connected incorrectly ( had just moved, bro-in-law did put hoses wrong).  He did not fix the hose problem, saying he wasn't allowed to touch the hoses.  He said I could do it on my own.  He charged me $75.  Then I could not do the hoses myself.  Drain valve was stripped so had to call tech again.  This time they quoted me $300 to change drain valve and hook up hoses properly.  I complained about price and tech told me to go on internet and find a coupon so I did for 20% off.  Then he charged me $222.  He was actually nice, but once he left, the cold wash STILL ran hot.  So, I'm out a total of $300 and still have the same problem as when I called.  I will NEVER be calling Sears again.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I cannot tell you how pleased I was with Junior and Chris's work that was done at my house on the barbecue.  They went over and above their normal duties and the conclusion was that it would cost to much to repair the current barbecue.  I really appreciated all the hard work and effort that they put into it and I can tell you that I would recommend these two men to any one that has a problem.  They were absolutely the best.

The actual work of the technician was fine, but the arrival window was 1-5PM and at 5, I got a call stating he was unable to arrive before 6PM.  In actuality, he arrived closer to 7PM.  Not terribly impressed with SEARS' time-resources-management--especially the same week that my three-week-old Die Hard truck battery failed with a "bad solenoid".  SEARS!  Do you have ANY interest in remaining in business?  C'mon Man!</Review>

< review>
I used the online booking and got the appointment for 8am-12pm two mornings later. I got confirmation of text and email almost immediately. The technician, George, called on his way to confirm which allowed me to give him directions which are necessary to find my house. He identified the problem immediately with my dryer, and we jointly decided to replace the belt and a motor pulley as preventive maintenance. While he retrieved the parts I rebuilt the dryer vent, and in short order my dryer was as good as new, and I was able to apply my coupon! A pleasure to have someone with his work ethic and timeliness perform that repair. I would give George six stars, but you only allowed five. Very pleased customer. Sears rocks.<//review>

Our central AC went off line during the hottest part of the summer, Sears tech showed up and had it running in minutes, with young grandkids and senior great-grandparents, those hot days were nothing to joke about. We are glad to have the Sears protection plan for our appliances; their technicians are superb at their job.<//text>

Very efficient and eager to please. That's why I always count on Sears.  Arranging for the repair on the 888 phone line was extremely frustrating, as it took three different people to help me and I was on the phone for 40 minutes!!!!. I also received 45 emails, confirming the appointment to tune up my five appliances  (per the promotion), canceling it, rescheduling it and confirming it again.  The customer service center needs serious attention in both speaking articulately and also having a helpful attitude!   Once I had the appointments it went smoothly.</Review>

The ice maker in our refri. wasn't working.  A repairman came out, and decided that we needed a new door.  A new door was shipped to us but it was the wrong side.  A mix-up I guess, as there was another customer waiting for that one, and they had mine in the shop.
Then they took the door from our house and nothing every happened after that.  And the ticket was closed!
I never got a follow up call and the tech never came back.
When I called to find out what was up, I had to open a new case.  That score would be a 1 on a scale of 1 - 10.
Another tech came out the second time.
This time the tech. was spot-on!  He took apart the wires apart from the bottom of the fridge and fixed the problem right then and there.
Fantastic!
So; overall I rate this a rollercoster ride!
Thanks

<text>The technician that replaced the ice maker in my refrigerator/freezer was excellent.  He obviously knew what he was doing, completed the repair quickly, tested to make sure the ice maker was working properly, and ensured that he did not leave anything out-of-place.  Truly an excellent experience!  Thank you Sears for providing reliable repair services.< /text><Time>1467339682881<//Time>< user_name>

<review>We had five different appliances serviced in one afternoon.  Three Sears technicians visited our home.  Each and every one was courteous and professional.  There was a span of 2-40 years of experience with Sears and, to a man, they represented the company well.  Each one was eager to explain exactly what they were doing and gave us ideas as to how we, as appliance owners, can care for them.  I was even given information on renewing our warranties.
Besides giving great service, I was so impressed with the friendliness and professionalism of each technician.  They showed pride in the service they provided.
I was so pleased.<//review><resp>None</resp></record>

Technician (Chris) was very knowledgeable in performing the service on our washer, dryer, and dishwasher. He performed services that had been neglected on previous routine maintenance service calls. He was also very helpful with information on how to keep the appliances working at optimal levels. Great service!</Review>

We have experienced the worst customer service ever since Sears La Jolla started contracting with outside repair people.  When we first used our warranty a few months ago, we were given an expert Sears-trained specialist who was wonderful and knew everything about our fridge.  but then Sears started using an outside contractor and it's been a TOTAL NIGHTMARE!!!  The guy is a nice enough guy, but is extremely overwhelmed, does not return calls or texts, hires third-party contractors to pick up his slack (guys who come in blind without the parts we're waiting on) and never follows up after appointments to let us know the status of our "next steps." He's been here 3 times over the last 2 months and still no working fridge. We are receiving a check for food spoilage from Sears, but enough is enough! We want our fridge fixed!  It's not even that old and the reason we bought the warranty was so we could get it serviced if and when we needed it!  Now, after all of that, I do want to say that if this guy is experiencing extreme pain in his life right now (marriage, finances, whatever), I'm very sorry for throwing you under the bus, but please do what you need to do to take care of yourself so you can run your business at an adequate level. Thank you!</text>

Never trust Sears for any type of home improvement services. Their service writers lied to get the job. I bought a new heating and AC unit with a brand-new electrical panel from Sears in May 2016. The job did not get started until September  21 , 2016. They send me  subcontractors after lying to me and telling me that sears does not use subcontractors. The subcontractors did a terrible job to begin with. But after putting a bad review on the company they were eager to fix all the problems and had to redo half of the job over .Even when they finished the job I had problems with the power cutting out it in my home when I used my A/C The subcontractors told me that they couldn't do anything about it. So I tried to contact Sears for over a month with emails phone calls calling different offices but never got a response from them about the problem. The project Cordinator who sold me the AC and heating unit promised me that if anything came up during the job that Sears would stand behind there work and would have to cover it. Because  he asked me if my outlet was working for my furnace and I told him that it never worked since I bought the home and that I couldn't answer that question. I told not to worry about it that Sear stood behind there work. Well sure enough the outlet became a problem and Sears would not respond to me about the problem no matter how much I tried to contact them. So I had to contact the HERO program who finance this project. They took care of this for me in less than two weeks. They got Sears to approve for the sub contractor to repair my electrical outlet. So while all this was going on San Diego gas and electric came out to inspect my gas meter and told me that the AC unit was too close to the meter that it was a hazard and wouldn't pass inspection. The subcontractor had to come out and re-locate my AC unit after all the mistakes that they had to fix already. What a joke . To this day I haven't heard from Sears at all. WARNING do not trust SEARS.</Review>

The gentleman that came to do the work was cordial and efficient. We are always appreciative of his work to maintain our treadmill. However, the scheduling was terrible. We scheduled to have him come in the morning (8 am - 12pm). The choice was morning or afternoon (12 - 5). He did not show up till 12:30. This made us wait for 4 hours. Our time is valuable too. Missed work in order to be home to let him in.<//Review>

<Review>Repair- awesome!   Time to wait for them to come out-less than satisfactory. My refrigerator door was broken and wouldn't seal so my food was going bad.

I am not happy at all with the service I received during this "installation." I was not present, so I cannot say how it would have turned out if I had, but the installers merely left the washer in my garage and left. They claimed that one of the inlet valves on the wall was "stripped" and left without making another appointment.

I came home and found the cold water inlet valve was indeed stripped, so I promptly replaced both. However, since they did not follow up with another appointment, I installed the washer myself. I had to call Sears to make an appointment for them to remove the old washer.

Now I understand Sears is not responsible for faulty valves, but they could have least turned off the water to the house and installed the washer. I could have came in behind them and replaced the valves later. Additionally, as my sons reported to me, one of the crew expressed a desire to leave because it was almost quitting time (it was 4 pm).

If I was there, I would have told them installing the washer with the water turned off was a reasonable alternative, given I couldn't replace the valve while they waited. They tried to call me, but I was on the road, and on the phone with another call. I tried to call them back, but no answer. I called Sears and asked them to call Dispatch to have them return, but that failed, too.

I fully understand the liability issue, but as I stated, if they had reached me, I would have waived this requirement and had them install the washer. I feel that the technicians used the flimsiest of excuses to not do the job. Additionally, not scheduling another installation appointment was also unacceptable. I shouldn't have had to call to do it, nor should I have had to call to have the old washer hauled away (since I paid for it).

So, overall, I am not happy with the service I received from Sears Home Services this time.< /text>

After establishing my appointment 9 days earlier,  the technician was on time, courteous, cleaned up after himself,  but did not fix my kenmore washing machine. He did some test and told me he could not find anything wrong with the machine and left. I immediately started a load of wash, after 10-15 minutes the machine stopped in midcycle with the tub full of water as it had done before. I called Sears and asked for the technician to return,  I was told that was not possible, I pleaded for some priority,  but again I was told that was not possible either,  I was then forced to accept another appointment 9 days later. After 18 days, I'm crossing my fingers that they will actually fix the machine. Wish me luck!<//text>

<review>The tech was on time and cleaned up after himself.  The difficult problem was diagnosed quickly and fixed.  If you cannot provide appliances that last ( washer was less than 2 years old )  then having techs that are smart is required.  I hope all of the techs have as much knowledge as the one that came to my house.<//review>< resp>

Great experience with Customer Service Rep setting up this appointment and happy that the system all checked out fine.  Given SEARs' status, will it be the last service too?  Hope not.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>It took 2 calls to have the washer fixed properly.  On the 2nd visit the repair man was very nice cordial friendly.  We were his 9th call so he was out at our house 8pm Pacific time.  He explained in good detail what he felt was the issue and order the parts.  The repair man that showed up to do the install of the parts was very rude.  You could tell he was there just to do a job.  Did not care about customer interaction or nor did he even follow up with explaining the parts installed and what he did.  I wish I had his name but his tech ID 0003426.  I would not have him back.<//review>< Rate>

Our technician was AMAZING.  He was helpful, not only with the dishwasher, but gave me some advice on some of my other appliances, he made a call to find out which appliances were on warranty, and he gave me some really good ideas of how to keep my dishwasher running well.   highly recommend him and the company he represents.<//Text>

I have bought all of our appliances through Sears, and they all have the maintenance agreement. Sears technicians have been very thorough about trouble shooting and making repairs and keeping me informed of progress when parts must be ordered. They also have been helpful and informative beyond the basic level of what was needed.  My only complaint: the appointment "window". It would be really helpful to have more information about when the technician will arrive.  If I am the 9th of 10 appointments in the window, it would be nice to know.</Review>

<rate>1<//rate><text>While the technician was knowledgeable and his service efficient and effective, the entire communication process with SHS was abysmal at best. I was hung up on twice by customer service: Once while trying to confirm an appointment and again while trying to determine why said appointment did not show up as expected. My appointment was cancelled, without any notification to me, because parts that I didn't know were being shipped to my house hadn't arrived on time.

Only once I took to social media for support did I receive any sort of reliable contact from SHS, but even then, the technician arrived at 9:45AM when my service window was from 3PM-6PM.

What should have been a simply appointment (I needed a dryer door replaced, which ultimately took 10 minutes for the technician to install) cost me hours of work while waiting for appointments that did not happen and hours of frustration trying to manage my own repair and contacting inept customer service.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1534358532070, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to bring this to our attention.

< review>
We have had an extended service agreement on our stacked laundry unit for several years. We have had annual preventative maintenance performed and been very satisfied. This year has been different. After the first service appointment, it smelled like something was burning when we used the dryer. After second service appointment to address that issue, the dryer will not work at all. Our service call for yesterday was a no show; when we called Sears , we were told our technician called in sick and the service would need to be rescheduled. There was no notice, email, or telephone call to us to let us know; we called to find out. Our fourth four hour service window is scheduled for next Tuesday. Fourth time is a charm, we hope, because this preventative maintenance has cost us 16 hours of leave from work in three weeks.<//review>

< Review>
Technician was rude and closed out the order before I had a chance to look at what he had done.  He said too bad and to call for another service appointment.  He did not center the dishwasher in the space and left a big gap on one side exposing the side of the dishwasher.

I asked him if he would be coming back to install the gasket in the refrigerator and he said he told the "guy" how to do it.  The "guy" he was taking to had nothing to do with the property and was a worker there.

He was quite uncooperative and unpleasant.  I have had many other services from Sears who were all very pleasant and profession.  Perhaps this technician needs to find a job he likes better.</Review>

Not only was our problem rectified, but the out-of-pocket cost was ZERO due to the fact that we had purchased the maintenance agreement last year.

<user_name>gloria cady</user_name><text>The second repairman, Reuben, worked above & beyond in his efforts to repair the freezer door, in spite of the fact that the first repairman, spent little time on repair or analysis & simply ordered parts that when received proved to be the wrong parts. Reuben, is to be commended for his ingenuity & tenacity in solving the problem.  I only regret that he wasn't the first repair person assigned to my job, since my tenant wouldn't have had to go Nine (9) days without access to a freezer.</text></record></dataset><record>

I tried to rate your service as requested on a previous email that you sent me. I went through a lot of questions and answers and then before I could complete the survey it kept asking me to enter a valid email address when I had already done so. This address is correct and is the same address you used to send me the survey in the first place. Needless to say this left me frustrated and not wanting to take more of your surveys. I suggest you fix your survey tool.
Service was top notch on the repair. Survey tool was not.< /Text>

Our technician processed our first annual service inspection of our LG washer/dryer/fridge. He was very knowledgeable and provided lots of preventative care suggestions. Great work overall.

I am disappointed in the billing.  The tech properly diagnosed the problem with my dishwasher not draining was a clogged kitchen drain and low hung drain hose from the dishwasher.  He taped the drain hose up with electrical tape, quite temporary.
The tech charged me $118; $59 for the diagnosis, plus $59 for the temporary tape job.  The tape job is not worth paying for and when I discussed it with the tech he blamed the computer system for the minimum labor increment.
I disputed the $59 labor charge with customer service and was promised a response within 48 hours.  That was 2 business days ago and I am still waiting.  I am now on the phone awaiting a service representative response.  It has been 20 minutes on hold, so I am tired of waiting.  Thought you should know.<//Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Response>None<//Response><Review>We have had 3 different service trips for the same and original issue and our machine still does not work.  Someone is again coming tomorrow.  The original diagnosis was done without really understanding our machine and to do something, the tech just ordered a new motor which we questioned as the machine is less than 2 years old.  The parts are not available so we had to wait 11 days for them.  After the motor was put it, they then determined that is not the issue.  I have to say that the repair tech's need better training.  The last person they sent, Chester, at least had good and polite customer service and hopefully he will be the guy to come out tomorrow to fix our washer once and for all.  Its been weeks with a family of 4 and no laundry.  Ugh!< /Review></record>

I was not home.  My husband was home and he felt it was all right.  The oven is baking better now, so I am glad about that.  There was an issue that the technician may have discussed with my husband: the fabric around the heating elements on the door (I think it's heating element) have frayed.  I am concerned about that.  Also, I think $199 was pretty pricey.

I have a question for you.  I got a phone call from Sears suggesting I get a lifetime warranty for only $77 for everything:  housecall, repair, equipment.  I told the caller that I thought that was too good to be true for the aged oven and could he email a contract that I could read.  I had heard from others that warranties were  a waste since they didn't cover things promised.  I never got the email and I wonder if this was from Sears officially.

Thank you.

I signed up for the appliance insurance that included a preventative maintenance check up.  The first guy to show up arrived around/after 5pm for a 1-5 scheduled appointment which was ok.  I showed him where the washer was and stayed with him -as he was talking - very knowledgeable - the entire time. He did a few things - checked the balance with his phone, raised the lid to make sure it shut off, and a few other casual things and was gone in about 10-15 minutes max.  Was a bit surprised about the brevity of that check up as it sure was shorter than I had had in the past. Called Sears and asked what constituted a preventative maintenance checkup these days. Calling was an experience as well til I found a wonderful gal/ Rosalinda?.  It took her 10-15 minutes to READ the preventative maintenance list. So I got a 2nd preventative maintenance appointment for June 1 by John which I felt was totally complete - and while he was quick - it was longer than Guy #1.< /text>

<review>The repair itself was fine, once the technician arrived the machine was repaired.  The technician left some boxes etc, without instructions if it was trash or we should keep.
The biggest issue was the scheduling,  we were scheduled for 1pm to 5pm. we took a half day off, using vacation hours to be available.  We were then given a 2 hour window of 3pm to 5pm. Still ok. the the web site updated to 6:30-8:30, then 4-6, then 6:15-8:15, never once did we get an email update we signed up for or a text update.  the technician finally showed up after 6pm.  This was a waste of our day and a waste of our vacation time.  Time I do not get back.  very disappointed with the scheduling and arrival time.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

My Sears Refrigerator broke down on June 30, 2017.  With the July 4 Holiday I couldn't get a technician out until July 7 and  I had to discard a refrigerator full of food.
The technician arrived at 10:30 AM and replaced one part and then found out that another part was not working and ordered it for me.
When it arrived he was able to come out and totally repair my refrigerator.
My recent Sears experience reinforced the value of my choosing Kenmore products since 1955.</Text>

This was the third call (and third technician) on the same repair. Technician #1 ordered a replacement part for my oven and told me the part was under warranty. Technician #2 could not do the replacement because the wrong part had been ordered. Technician #3 successfully replaced the part but argued with me about the warranty eligibility that I had been promised and generally spoke to me about the repair as if I were an ignorant child. Previous Sears service on my dryer had been great, but this experience was very unpleasant and I will not contact Sears again.<//review>

Sears is really stupid. My name is Phil but yet they call me Gary. I have told them my name is Phil at least 20 times. The tech did a great job. But the customer service department sucks. I was not notified that my warranty was expiring and after I called Sears the told me it was expired. They would renew it at a lot higher rate even though I have had a warranty on this oven for over 10 years.  No wonder they are going into bankruptcy</review>

We bought our brand new washer and dryer from Sears and tried to get our washer fixed through them 5 years later. We paid half of what it would've cost us if we bought new ones. Within 3 months, they broke again so we called them back. They fixed it but it broke again after a few months. They said warranty is only for 3 months. Washer should last more than five years in the first place. And when they charged us for repair, it should last more than 4 months. Needless to say, I will not buy any more appliances from Sears and I hope that many will heed this warning. Perhaps this is why you're on the verge of bankruptcy!! I'drate you ZERO stars if it was an option!< /review>

<Text>Booking a repair appointment went to a call center but was pretty easy.  We agreed upon a date and time window and I rec'd a reminder email.  Unfortunately it wasn't until later (when I wondered where the repairman was at the end of the time window) that I did some investigating and reopened the reminder and saw another area where I could click.  Once I clicked on that I saw that my appointment had been rescheduled for a later time slot!  Very frustrating.  Sears needs to get rid of that confusing reminder-but-really-a-rescheduling-email and just call the customer to let them know the time has changed as soon as they know so there isn't so much needless waiting around.  Once the repair tech got here all went smoothly.  He was very professional & personable and got the job done, giving us tips to help our washer last. Thank you, Sears!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Repair man came out prior to last visit. He ordered a new seal and a couple of hinge parts. When he came out he fixed the hinge issue and did not replace the door seal. He took the new seal with him.  I think he should of replaced it since it was ordered and delivered to my home.  And this was the 2nd time we had to call about the seal.
Repairman had a very strong cigarette smell.<//Review>

The repairman showed up on time and was friendly and knowledgeable. He was able to diagnose and fix the problem with my dishwasher fairly quickly. I feel like the price was fair for the work that was done. I would use Sears Appliance Repair again.</review>

Terrible experience in the beginning because the scheduler could not speak English.  He was also rude.  I took off work and waited around, no one showed up to fix the washer. However, when I called back to ask why no one showed up, the next person was more friendly but also difficult to understand.  The service man who was finally scheduled a week later was awesome and very helpful.  Great guy!

I finally talked with someone else at Sears who told me that two of your call centers are located out of the Country so you can hit a bigger profit margin.   That's a real shame.<//text>

This is the first bad review I have ever written....  This is the fourth "repair" on my fridge this year, Sears will only resolve the symptom, not the root cause.  Every few months the fridge needs to be manually defrosted.  Sears replaces all the parts related to defrosting, but to no avail, it frosts up again a few months later.  Sears just seems to be biding their time until the extended warranty runs out, so they do not have to replace it as lemon.  To make matters even worse, it took two appointments to get the parts identified and ordered and for each appointment the service person arrived outside the repair window.  The service repair people have been nice, but they all admit it outside their ability to really repair the fridge and outside their authority to replace the unit.  When I tried to resolve the issue with customer service, they refused to make it right.  Looks like I will need a new fridge once the warranty runs out, but it won't come from Sears.<//Review>

The seal isn't fitting on the entire lid anymore, and as a result, ice has built up inside the door and adhered to the insulation, and the door is now falling apart!  We are extremely unhappy with this service.  We were rejected because of "abuse"!  How, may I ask, have we abused our freezer??? We open and shut it to put things in, we defrost it, and chip off the ice, as one of the technicians in the past told us to do.  I'm not even sure how one can abuse a chest freezer unless they were beating it with a bat!  We are a family of 8 and rely heavily on our chest freezer. We just renewed our coverage for this appliance and we are VERY DISAPPOINTED in our service!  Please contact us on this matter before this post goes on Yelp, Facebook, Instagram, Linked In, Next Door, and word of mouth reviews.  Very unhappily yours,

<Response>None</Response><Review>I have had Sears warranty service for over 10 years on five different appliance. This last repair service was the absolute worst. My microwave vent flap was broken, I had a friend who was here for appt window. A few days later I realized a piece of foil was stuck to the top (I don't know what that was for) and now two weeks later the vent has fallen off again. The repair person did not reorder another part, just tried to snap it in place after I told them it was broken. There was not a receipt left after the service, nothing. I had to ask myself if Sears even came and did anything. So here I am calling for another appt three weeks later and requesting a Senior Technician.  Super horrible
Service. I tried posting this without any stars but I couldn't, that's the only reason why it has one star.<//Review>< Date>

<Text>I called to have my dryer serviced as it was taking a very long time to dry clothes.  The technician found nothing wrong with the dryer itself and stated the exhaust venting was probably clogged and needed cleaned and gave me a number to call for someone to come out.  He didn't tell me that these people would not move out my stacked washer and dryer from the closet where they are located to do the work.

When the cleaners arrived they found it vented to the roof of the second story building and there was nothing they could do since they didn't have a long ladder, and weren't allowed to move the washer and dryer out to work from inside.  I had described my closet with a stacked washer and dryer when I made the appointment and told them it was on the second floor.

I am now without a usable dryer for a week. I wish I had called someone else.

The technicians themselves were polite but it seems they need more training so they know what can and cannot be done. On the other hand, I have previously had  some very knowledgable technicians fix other problems on my appliances, as well as some very incompetent guys.  You never know which kind you will get.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>I don't normally write reviews like this, but the Sears repairman who came to work on our dishwasher was so impressive that I am breaking my rule!  First, he had a remarkably cheerful and positive aspect. Second, he was extremely competent – he got straight to the heart of the problem with great efficiency, explaining everything he was doing as he worked, and offering valuable advice about the ideal settings, best temperature for washing, filters, best rinse products, etc. He was in and out within 30 minutes, much of which was advising us on best practices for dishwashing. Our dishes never looked so good after following this advice.< /review>< pics>

<Text>We bought our brand new washer and dryer from Sears and tried to get our washer fixed through them 5 years later. We paid half of what it would've cost us if we bought new ones. Within 3 months, they broke again so we called them back. They fixed it but it broke again after a few months. They said warranty is only for 3 months. Washer should last more than five years in the first place. And when they charged us for repair, it should last more than 4 months. Needless to say, I will not buy any more appliances from Sears and I hope that many will heed this warning. Perhaps this is why you're on the verge of bankruptcy!! I'drate you ZERO stars if it was an option!</Text>< pics>

<review>My 15-year old refrigerator was having problems freezing and keeping cold in the refrigerator part.  My Sears technician came out and diagnosed the problem as ice build up from a faulty hose that provides water to the ice maker.  He removed the back plate inside the freezer and the entire coil system was encased in ice.  He used a steamer to melt the ice and in a couple hours the refrigerator was operating normal again.  I am extremely pleased with the service provided by my Sears technician and the price was very reasonable!  Thank you Sears!< /review>< pics>

The technician was rather rude, his first comment was, "let's see what you broke".  He did nothing to explain what he was doing other than to insinuate that a label, about the size of a pee could have damaged my machine and that I need to clean the glass better.  In the end, the issue was not my machine, it was my plumbing.  Rather than being charged the $79 diagnostic fee I was charged $94.  The tech could not explain why, "the computer gives me the price, I don't do it".  This visit pretty much confirmed what I knew already, Sears is on it's way out.  This company no longer has quality employees and will probably be a thing of the past.  My next appliance will be purchased with a different company.< /Review>

Great service from your Technician, he was prompt in diagnosing the problem and got our dryer fixed within a half hour.  He also gave us advice on how to keep our washer running smoothly by running the wash cycle using Washer Magic solution.

Thank you!</Review>

The repairman was great.  He had the part on his truck and replaced it in a short time.  It was the experience getting him there that was disturbing.</text>

< Review>
The servicemen have been polite and seemingly knowledgable on an endless series of visits. First I didn't hear the doorbell so he left. Yes I was on the phone but no tv or music playing, he must not have tried very hard. So that led to a reschedule. The next visit the problem was diagnosed and parts ordered. Third visit parts installed refrigerator now at correct temperature. Serviceman leaves then I discover no water coming from water dispenser but plenty on floor. Visit number 4 new problem diagnosed and parts ordered. Waiting for visit 5. The refrigerator is only 2 years old. I do not know how people who work full-time manage the appointments.< /Review>

After several technical visits and multiple parts replacements by Sears technicians (all of whom were very nice), Sears is avoiding honoring their published "LEMON-REPLACEMENT-POLICY!  We had great difficulty trying to communicate with them - - - - it is a joke and a waste of time!</review>

<Text>The real expert dialed in my dishwasher repair diagnosis with a prescription recommending 'magic'...specifically: Dishwasher Magic, with a dish-less wash between each dish-filled wash, until the hardwater deposits are removed from the machine.

I was still on mfr warrantee for a Kenmore water heater, but Sears still charged me a $79 service call fee. They replaced the leaky water heater (free?) but charged me $520 for installation and new inspection fee, and the installer charged me another $219 for an extra part that (mysteriously) San Diego requires for no good reason than possibly to reward a favored contributor to its politicians. I'm not sure who's palms are getting greased by San Diego's requirement now of a re-inspection of any replacement appliance after one year. So -- for more money than my original water heater, I have a smaller water heater (50 gals, Kenmore has discontinued the 55 gal model ) that I can hear running every time I go into the garage. I never heard my old water heater running.<//Review>

This review has nothing to do with the technicians and everything to do with the ability for Sears to schedule a 4 hour time range and stick to it. My experience was terrible just to get someone to the house to fix the washer. It was a clogged pipe and cost me $300+. I'll go with a local appliance repair next time.<//review>

Technicians were great, polite, and got our problem solved completely.  However, the new Sears policy for billing, which does not permit the technician to simply swipe a credit card, but requires the tech to call and repeat all the information verbally, seems like a huge waste of time, both for the technicians and the customers!< /Text>

The other did not show up until about 5:30. In the mean time, Sears sent me an email telling me of the later arrival window which I did not see until the next day because I do not check my emails several times a day. The scheduling department needs to call a customer to alert them of the delays. Because of the late arrival of the second technician, my dinner burned in the oven because he had to chat with me.
The technicians are over-scheduled and made to zig zag across the county. It's ridiculous!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Technician was over one hour late beyond scheduled time window.  I was, however;,called by phone as the time window expired that he would be late.
Technician was extremely professional in his handling of the situation and quickly identified the actual problem which had been misdiagnosed by the individual that took my initial phone call about the problem.  When he correctly identified the problem, he realized that he did not have the necessary part in his on board truck inventory as he ad utilized it on a previous service call that morning.  He was able to locate the necessary part with a fellow technician, proceeded to go and get it ad return to complete the service.  ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL!!  Thanks.< /Review>

<Text>Karen was my sears appliance repair person. She did an absolutely fantastic job. she identified the problem on the first visit and ordered the parts necessary for the 2nd visit repair. She is very knowledgeable and really knows the ins and outs of the LG washer that was the repair problem.
I am encouraged to see a woman performing the work that men have done for decades.
she is very personable, and she explained what was wrong so I knew what to expect in the way of repairs. she did an excellent job.

the only thing I did not like was the amount of time Sears takes to make the 2nd appointment. a 2nd person was needed since I have a stack washer and dryer, but 3 weeks is too long to wait for any repair.<//Text>< pics>

The tech was very competent.  However, the wait time for the tech was extremely long.  The weather was rainy and bad, so I understand.  However, it seems like there are not enough local techs to handle the wotk in San Diego county.  Other repair companies have shorter (i.e., 2 hour) windows for when the tech will arrive.</text>

The "service" person was here about 5 minutes took the ice maker out , tried to sell me a maintenance contract on all my appliances, put it back in, discouraged me when I asked him to check the filter which has never been changed by saying that would probably cause more problems, put the ice maker back in, charged me less than quoted and left.  In less than 24 hours it was doing just what it had been doing before he fixed it.</Review>

Easy to schedule, timely reliable hassle free service.
For minor repairs , which is done in  less than one hour , the charges are a little more . $100 for labor  would be reasonable.</text>

<Review>Sears repair guy came out and right away and after a short conversation knew what was wrong and agreed with me that it might have been a belt problem on my dryer.

The repairman was very nice but the refrigerator door is still not working properly. Someone has been scheduled to come back and try to fix it.  This last time was the second time a service person showed up. The first guy was a dishwasher repair man and knew nothing about refrigerators.<//Text>

<Review>Joshua, the Sears Tech,  was very nice and thorough. He installed my ice maker after all the right parts arrived the 3rd time, another tech had ordered only half of what I needed the first time and so second tech couldn't install it. So after Joshua installed new ice maker. The new Ice Maker failed to make ice but a few ice cubes in 36 hours, so Joshua had to come back again 2 days later, the 4th time.  He did a complete diagnostic analysis and discovered that the ice maker had a defective sensor.
So I just received the new ice maker parts and he will be back out on Monday, the 5th time, no fault of his.   Hope it works out this time!<//Review><Rating>3< /Rating>< user>

I would have given it a five if the technician had found the problem on his first visit.  On the second visit it was diagnosed correctly and a new door for the freezer was ordered.  The young man who installed the new door was very  nice and very professional.  The new door seems to have solved the problem.</review>

The repair of our front load washer was never completed after three tries and after three months. It started on September 19 on November 1st we got one of two parts ordered on the third try and the second part was not found. After we were told the second part was still not sent we called the lemon hot line at Sears and was given money to buy a new washer. We called the parts dept to return the part that we had here and they said the second part was on its way. It was just like the right had did not know what the left had was doing. Glad we got a new washer though. It looks like the technicians are in a hurry to get to the next job and don't spend enough time diagnosing the problem. They replaced the motor and roter the  first time the washer drum shocks. The third time they said it was the motor PCB board which was never delivered or installed.<//Text>

<Review>The repair man was very friendly and explained everything well. I was a bit surprised on the total bill though. I purchased Appliance Plan and was told that I would save 50% off the total bill due to purchase. I did not. The total bill, at that time, was $150 and my saving was only $69.50. I was also charged labor twice since he also cleaned my dryer. Why two labor charges for the same visit? The original reason for the visit was my washer, $150. Then add the $42.50 labor for cleaning my dryer. Then add $50 for the Appliance Plan. That's a total of $242.50. Apply the 50% discount, and I should have paid $122.25. Instead I paid $204.50...I overpaid by $82.25. Not sure why. Usually I don't have any issues with Sears Repair, but this time has me wondering...be sure to go over the bill piece by piece with the repair man while he's still at your house PRIOR to paying.< /Review><name>Stephanie York<//name><Rate>4< /Rate>< date>

Horrible service. I have called for a technician to come out several times and the original problem still exist. The last technician told us that a particular service was required to fix my problem and that it would cost. I thought this was why I purchased a warranty some time back. Completely dis-satisfied with my service so far.....< /Review>

<review>The technician was very unhelpful and had a terrible attitude. He was not happy to be here. His answers were very curt, short, sarcastic and rude and he seem annoyed. He could not repair our ice maker and just said that Sears would call us with a resolution. I was very happy with the new fridge that I am receiving today but the technician that came out should not be working with the public.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>A $140 charge for a 15 minute repair when I supplied the replacement parts seems excessive. Also I requested a refrigerator repair on the same service call however the tech who came was only qualified to perform dishwasher repairs.< /review>< name>

The young serviceman, that came out to check our freezer ice maker, seemed to be quite knowledgeable and patient in repairing the ice maker which wasn't rotating/ dispensing ice cubes properly.  He was able to fix it and did temporarily make a bit more ice, a couple hours after he left however, we are again encountering problems where it's not making enough ice cubes and is now making just a sheet of ice into our ice box!  :(  Called in for another service appointment, this morning.  Glad to know, that a serviceman will be coming out again, tomorrow morning.< /Text>

Chester the repairman came on time & with a phone call.
He informed me diagnostic run on Samsung washer was okay.
He said sometimes after trouble shoot & "reset" mode it starts to work after a day or two & to leave it unplugged for a longer period of time.
Too bad these Samsung washers have constant problems. After this I will not buy another Samsung washer or dryer EVER AGAIN :(
I will go back to KENMORE & LC & MAYTAG !!!<//Review>

Communication was not good and cost me extra time and money. The company is also very limited with time to provide service. Sears hires a 3rd party company to provide the service and if they can't perform the job Sears have no back up plan. I am not a happy customer!<//Text>

They fixed half the issues.   Frig couldn't defrost itself so vents became blocked and refrigerator portion could get no cold air from the freezer compartment - they fixed that.  But the LED display that shows the temps was...and is...broken but they ignored that.< /review>

<Text>After three calls just to get the right date scheduled, the tech came to install a back panel and a new motherboard for our broken POS kenmore "elite" fridge. This guy took out the old motherboard, set it next to the new one, and then re-installed the old motherboard again, despite me asking if it was the right one a few different times. he didn't stay to see if everything was working properly, and of course, the same error came up again 15 minutes after he left. We finally got another tech out to install the new motherboard, and not even three hours after he left the fridge started malfunctioning and displaying the same error code. We're now in our fourth week with a broken fridge, over $700 down the drain, and no guarantee it's ever going to work. What a piece of crap.

Sears service is horrible, and kenmore appliances are even worse. The only thing "elite" about that line is the price. Our kenmore elite microwave shuts itself off if you use it for more than 3 minutes, our kenmore elite refrigerator barely lasted three years, and our kenmore oven is 30-50 degrees off from whatever temperature you set it to. I'm never buying anything from Kenmore again.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dc072a5a9d502f:0x47c5d90122b14876< /gmap_id>< UserId.>

<Review>I called in with a microwave that stopped working one evening.  Sears repair came out and refused to fix or replace the oven because of rust.  They said my paid-for warranty was no good.  Very bad service--or more correctly, lack of service.

I called for two range burners where the auto-ignition was not working.  Sears had told me I had a warranty covering all of my appliances, but the repair guy told me the stove was not covered, and offered a warranty if I was willing to pay him $300.  Disappointing service.< /Review>< Pictures>

My Sears repairman was very professional, efficient and successful in fixing my refrigerator problem. He went a step further and made two adjustments that would keep the problem from occurring in the future.<//review>

Good luck getting an appt. and having them actually keep that date... I was called to have my appt changed to ANOTHER month out. (Not the first time there has been a change of appt on their part) I bought MY LG dishwasher (broke and making terrible noise), my LG french door fridge, my Jenn Air stove and my Sterns and Foster mattress set from them... They better get it together or my next purchase WON'T be from them! VERY DISSAPOINTED>>></review>

<Text>Horrible, Horrible, 3 weeks after initial appointment washer still not fixed. Waited til the day before to order a part the technician guessed was wrong.  After they cancelled the appointment today, was given a run around for 4 hours on the phone, back and forth between departments and no appointment or technician yet. There is a reason Sears is going under.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Brought a sewing machine in for annual tune-up. After 1 month the repair was still pending and I cancelled it (which took around 40 minutes on phone since nobody seems to be able to handle that request). Eventually I got the machine back with a $30 piece broken off by the Sears technician. Another 30 minutes on the phone and 15 minutes in the store at least allowed me to get my $35 prepay back. So all in all 85 minutes talking to incompetent staff, 1 month of waiting, and all I have to show for it is an appliance broken by Sears. Never again !< /Review>

<Review>Very disappointed I purchase insurance for one year  $399.99
when they went to check my refrigerator....the technician said the grill on the back needs to be taken off and clean inside but was not cover by the
insurance.  (IT DEFEAT THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF BUYING THE ONE YEAR INSURANCE)<//Review>< pics>

I've had to deal with Sears for 3 repairs and each time, they were all botched multiple times in multiple ways not by the technicians, but Sears infrastructure: scheduling, warehouse, and parts.  As an example, it took over two months and 3 visits by texhnicians to get a new microwave oven installed. The latest experience was having Sears rescind our extended warranty when we needed it for a repair of our 1 1/2 year old Dacor oven. SEARS us not what it used to be.<//review>

there is no way for a consumer to connect with the local store for questions. you're either forwarded to an offshore call center that can't answer any of your questions, or routed to a voice recording that tells you to enter your remote access code. this is a real issue that sears needs to get resolved.<//Review>

Repairman came, spent over an hour "fixing" our dryer. Charged me over $200. After he left, the dryer still makes the same loud scraping sound that caused me to request repair service in the first place. I would give no stars, but this web site won't accept a post with less than one star. Go elsewhere for your Maytag repairs.</Text>

We called in for services for 2 separate machines.  One is the Dishwasher Machine and the other is the Kenmore Stacked Laundry/Dryer Machine.  This review is for the services for Kenmore Stacked Laundry/Dryer Machine.  The survey of the Dishwasher Machine  is done separately and already sent.  We were not happy with the services we received for the Kenmore Stacked Laundry/Dryer Machine.</Review>

My microwave experience was terrible.  Everything that went well on the washer/dryer, went wrong on the microwave.  My stainless steel microwave door needed to be replaced, but when the repair technician called corporate they said they couldn't ger a stainless steel door, so they would send a black door!  That doesn't work for me.< /review>

Sears has refused to replace a dishwasher even after its technicians have been out more than 6 times trying unsuccessfully to fix it .  They now claim that it's the hard water and use of too much dishwashing detergent that is causing the dishwasher to leave a film of white on the dishes.<//Text>
