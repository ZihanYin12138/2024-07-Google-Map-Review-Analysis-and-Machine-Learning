<review>Had the steak fajitas with black beans, rice and tortillas. Large portions and very delicious. I'm glad there is still a Baja Fresh around since they closed so many of them in the past.

I give this place a 1 star because of how dirty the restaurant was. The bathroom, the floors and the soda counter. Unfortunately, the restaurant was basically empty so I can't associate the blame to a busy croud. The is an A grade from the health department posted but if they came when we were there, that wouldn't be the case. I really like Baja Fresh and have never seen one this neglected. As I read through the reviews, this restaurant has had previous customers with the same cleanliness concerns.< /Text>

<user>108116807816829062737< /user><review>Its so frustrating to watch staff move so leisurely, not one ounce of hurrying the pace. I was 4th in line. Cashier talked slow, pushed buttons even slower, and then had to pause between orders. The cook was running in and out for pickup orders. They both kept looking at the line that was growing longer like they were being disturbed, or disrupted, as if the patrons were burdensome. I walked out.  Too much!< /review>< Name>

The service was great, but the burritos did not taste the same as before. I am not sure if it was the seasoning that was lacking or a missing ingredient.< /Text>

My husband raves about this place as when he's in the city working he comes here. Finally I was with him and he brought me. Fresh is right! Purple onion, red pepper, cotija, fresh avocado and grilled shrimp in this fantastic salad! Every bite chopped to the perfect size. I can't say enough about the dressing, SO much flavor. Remember to try the black salsa from the sparkling clean salsa bar. I'm not exaggerating! Never had black salsa and I don't  know how they make it but it's amazing with chips and on their wahoo tacos.</review>

The food here is really delicious and the freshness matches the advertising. We decided to come in for some Mexican flair and lucked out, because today kids eat free! (Sat. Feb, 8, 2020) The service was friendly and fast. They even gave us free chips while we waited. The salsa bar is excellent with a variety of choices including: mango, hot, medium, verde, pick de gallo and their signature which is delicious. Skip Mx Donald’s and give this place some love.<//Text>

< Review>
I came here for lunch while I was running an errand in Staples, since I haven't been to a Baja Fresh for the longest time. It's been ages since I had their food.  I decided to order their new Chicken Sandwich since from the photo, it looks tasty; so why not give it a try. I am so glad I ordered it.  The chicken pieces were large and the best part was that it wasn't dry or hard.   It had large chunks of Avocado, and a decent amount of lettuce.  I poured their hot salsa into the sandwich to give it an extra kick to the flavor. The sandwich tasted great. I was also enjoying their chips and salsa while waiting for my food.  Coming here really brought back memories of my childhood, when I used to come here just to eat their chips... hahaa..</Review>

Best food best staff.

Update 9-9-19. We already came back few times in  between last review and this one.

The manager always have smiling face and welcoming. The food is as great as before. You will never go wrong going to this Baja Fresh. Also on top of that the cost is not that expensive.

If you are going for first time, then don't miss its mango salsa. Other salsas are great too.</Text>

Was trying to go to senor Baja's.. For some fish tacos  A familiar place which has great food and reasonable prices.... Google sent me here . I am disappointed . I payed 34 dollars for 8 tacos .the (fish stick) yes I'm calling it a fish stick because that's what it looked like. It was over cooked and we threw 2 away .the gal was nice and gave me 2 bags of tortilla chips,the best part of what I ate was the free chips.  I miss the senor Baja's on foothill and haven.<//text>

Food is always great and tastes so clean. You will never get that "why did I eat that" feeling from Baja Fresh. The only downside was the AC for half of the building was broken so only the front portion of the restaurant was cool. I never kick a restaurant down a notch on aesthetics when theyre food is so amazing. Highly recommended to anyone that loves Mexican food thats fresh and doesn't make you hate yourself after eating it.< /text>

<Text>I personally love Baja Fresh! At first I couldn’t find this location because I’m not from the area, it’s a little hidden with all the trees around it, but it was really good just like I remember 😁 they still have the Chili lime shrimp salad. My fave🙌🏻< /Text>< pics>

I Really like their fish tacos and pretty much unlimited onions and rabanos you can get on the side. They used to give the tacos with a yellow cooked pepper and that made a difference for me in the reason why the tacos were different but they stopped😪< /Text>

As someone who is Mexican and loves Mexican food, this is one of the worst places I have ever gone to. If you like Americanized Mexican food like Chipotle then it’s decent food. They don’t have small tacos which was annoying but they’re customer service was AWESOME which is the only reason they get two stars.<//Review>

<userid>117834807610762064705</userid><text>I was told that Baja Fresh is good, but this one location was disappointing. The steak  and shrimp bowl tasted weird; it was bland with a strange after-taste. The chicken was pretty good, but overall it was below average. It was my first time coming there and it was at night on the week-end, but hardly anybody was there. I hope other Baja Fresh locations aren't as bad as this one.< /text>< rate>

Food looks pretty. But seriously. Flavorless. You bite into the food and it's there but the after taste is like from a can.  No happy with it but decided to try it out. For real tacos or Mexican food I say go another place. Food really feels washed out.< /Review>

<Text>Worst experience I've ever had at this location #122. Restaurant was filthy, salsa bar was empty and dirty. They only had one girl at the counter and 2 cooks. No one was cleaning the dining area and maintaining the salsa bar.  Food took forever because the counter girl went to the back office and I'm assuming she was on the phone for a good 20 min while everyone's food was sitting there getting cold.  We finally get our food and the order was wrong.  I mean,  come on. They fixed the order and by the time we left there and got our food home we had to microwave everything.  To top it off the shrimp tacos only had about 3 tiny shrimps in each.  It was like eating cabbage tacos.

Meh, not impressed with food nor service.  Oddly enough, "Combo" lunch doesn't include a drink.  Tea is NOT FRESH brewed, seriously?  Can't say we'll be back.  Had such high hopes.< /Review>

Kind service, and the food is good. Different from Chipotle, the individual ingredients are more recognizable in the foods taste.< /review>

It was great to have good Mexican food at a nice location. Excellent service keep it up 👍🏻</Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<review>First off, service was excellent. The girl at the counter war super nice. Too bad the food was disappointing but that's not her fault. So one star for that.
I'm just about done with this place with their filling proportions. The chicken burrito that I usually order cost almost two dollars more here than the other location I used to go to. However the burrito size was exceptionally large by which I initially dismissed the high price. But when you get through the entire burrito just to experience 70% rice and maybe 20% veggies and 10% chicken you can't say the size of the burrito justifies the 9$ price tag. I had a very large filling burrito that tasted mostly of rice. Sorry but I'm not visiting another baja fresh again. I'll be sticking to locally owned authentic mexican restaurants, or pollo lock, but I'm scratching this one off. Did I mention their bathrooms are always gross? This location was no different.</review>< Name>

Fantastic service. I didn't like my chicken bowl and asked for a change. The manager, Anam ( as I remembered) was very friendly and brought pen and paper to write down what I wanted in my bowl.<//Text>

This particular restaurant usually good has gone down fast. Fisrt, the service is really bad…there is no water so if you dont like sodas you are out of luck.
I found out that they are selling the place so the owner doesnt care.<//Review>

<Text>Drove 35 mins in traffic to get here and staff was rude. They stood behind the grills talking for almost 10 minutes before someone finally came to take our order. I ordered the dos manos burrito like I used to get in ventura county almost on a daily basis. She rudely told me that they don't have that burrito at this location, that if it's not on the menu under the burrito, they don't have it. I'm a major fan of baja fresh but this location is terrible. No wonder why there was no one in the restaurant. Never again will I come back to this location, and I will definitely deter anyone from going here.<//Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) The characteristics of the meal are "fresh", "ready-made", "delicious", especially the "FAJITA" dish, which is particularly delicious, "beef"
It's like a grilled steak, cut into strips and delicious.
"Black Beans" are also very special, with high nutritional content and delicious.
CHIP is also freshly fried, and the SAUCE is fresh and diverse.
Good location and staff near Ontairo Mill
Very kind. 💪😃

(Original)
餐㸃特色是「新鮮」、「現做」、「好吃」，尤其是「FAJITA 」這道料理，特別的好吃，「牛肉」
像烤好的五分熟牛排，切成一條一條，好吃極了。
「黑豆」也很有特色，營養成分高，又好吃。
CHIP也是現炸，供應的SAUCE，新鮮多樣美味。
位於Ontairo Mill附近，位置好，工作人員
都很親切。💪😃</text>

I have been on contract with Truly Nolan for the past 2 years and have had great results. Luis is my personal exterminator and he is very nice and professional. If I need him to do extra spider web removal or additional tasks, he always does it with a smile and pleasure.
My home is on 1/2 acre, 3 decks, gazebo, exterior entertainment areas, trees, shrubs, bushes, etc.. and have never had a rodent or pest issue get out of control or be a menace.
Every 3 months Luis comes out and spends about an hour taking care of business around my home. Also, if I notice any spiders, ants, or any other pests in between treatments, then I simply call the office and they send Luis out for additional treatments, at NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE.
It is a great service and one that all homeowners with children and pets should have to control / eliminate bugs, pests and all unwanted critters.
GREAT COMPANY AND SERVICE!!</Text>

I recently had my annual termite inspection with Truly Nolen. I want to give a shout out to Dena Marschke for her work ethic and professionalism. She is timely, conscious, thorough, and always answers all my questions, even texting me after her work hours. She is an asset to Truly Nolen, and I hope they recognize her superior qualities as an employee.<//review>

The first inspection was okay, they sold us on a year plan that they said was all they had. The first actual service didn't work, it made it worse. They missed a ton of spots, they never came for the second service or reached out, but they sure did charge my card for the monthly fee. I have called about 4 times, 2 of which is to cancel but I have yet to hear anything back from any manager they are claiming will call me back. The pest person tried to come to my house later than 6pm one night after not having any appointment or reaching out until 5 minutes before he showed up. I have yet to speak to any manager and I've been signed up for almost 2 months. Horrible service. They take your money and never get a hold of you when you have issues or trying to resolve those issues. Please work on your communication with people, if it wasn't this bad I would be repeatedly trying to cancel, which probably won't happen since NO ONE will call me back. So I'm paying for a service I don't want and that didn't help. I also received a random bill for 17 dollars. Which no can can explain to me what it is for.</review>

Dena
Did a complete and thorough inspection of the inside and outside of the house today. She was very professional  and friendly. She explained everything. (even the different termites) and pointed out problem sites of wasp/hornet nest. I was very confident and pleased with her work and wanted to give her an excellent rating! Thank you for a job well done.</review>

< review>
This was our first follow up from our treatment last year. Dena was very professional from the beginning, ie. morning call to give us status of her ETA. Our house number was not labeled very well so it took some time for her to find us, but the minor set back did not dampen her mood. She was friendly and courteous ie. adhering to social distancing and wearing a mask (THANK YOU!) and her overall energy was a breath of fresh air. After she inspected our property she not only gave us the results but also pointed out areas that we should keep an eye on and how to keep our home safe from pests. We were on the fence about renewing our yearly coverage (again it was our first time) but after Dena's amazing service we've decided to renew because we really feel like we're in good hands. Thank you Dena for all your hard work, we look forward to working with you in the future!</review>

Dena came in the hottest heat of summer and worked her tail off to get to the little termites monsters.  She found a  spot or two that the previous guys missed...or the termites found a new apartment in a new corner of my home.  Many thanks to her!<//Text>

Anthony our service tech arrived on time and explained everything he was going to do to get our bee problem taken care of, all was well after 30 minutes. The following day he was back again to do our first treatment of the whole house, again he was professional in his ability to answer all our questions and concerns as we have dogs and we wanted to know if the chemicals were harmful to them, which were pet friendly. Ant traps were placed around the house and the parameter of the house on the outside was sprayed. Anthony was very knowledgeable on all the products he was using, he was clean and tided up after he was finished. Totally happy 100% with this service call.<//Text>

I received service by Chris. I had quite a few spiders in my house, so the appointment was moved up from Monday to Saturday. That was a blessing for me, because it gave me the weekend to continue unpacking with peace of mind. Chris was professional and fun to talk to. I really appreciated his service. There are still a lot of webs around, but no spiders so far. Thank you for your service.</Text>

I've been a customer of Truly Nolan for about 35 years & have always been satisfied with their work. I recently had a new technician spray at my home. SANTOS LOPEZ, out of the San Diego location is OUTSTANDING!
He is professional, prompt, dedicated, friendly & extremely thorough.  He did a great job & I couldn't have been more satisfied. Congratulations on  having such an excellent employee!</Review>

Our Truly Nolen tech, Ricardo, arrived on time and performed what we felt was a thorough termite inspection in our attic, thought out the house and also outside. He was courteous, friendly and to best of our knowledge, very competent. Over the years that we have had termite coverage from Truly Nolen we have been, as far as we know, termite free.

Value appears  to be good. We have had no sign of termite activity since coming on with Truly Nolen..< /Review>

They were courteous and on time. Problem is if you live in an apartment, don't even bother calling them. I saw a mouse in my kitchen and we wanted them to seal the entry points in the kitchen just a one time service but they said they can't do anything if you live in a condo because they need to seal the entire building not individual units. So our meeting lasted 5mins. Wish they said that on the phone no need to meet up for that.<//Review>

<review>If I could give less than one star, I would. The company I work for has been desperately trying to communicate with ANYONE at this company who can help us with an issue with our property agreement for service. Truly Nolen offered to combine two of our treatment agreements into one to save us money, but then continued to invoice us for both agreements separately with the incorrect amounts. Repeated calls and emails to Truly Nolen were ignored or brushed off. We have emails dating back to April of us trying to resolve this issue and yet no one seems to be able to help us. We get new invoices, we call 3x and email 3x, and either receive no response or a "call our office and someone can assist you" response via email. Naturally, any call we make to the number they provide is just to a voicemail that gets no answer. Come today: we get a notice of collection against us despite REPEAT attempts to contact them over the last 5 months. Horrible customer service, would not recommend based on this alone.

EDIT 8/20/19 - The plot thickens. The collections letter we received wasn't even for the correct amount. To top it off, when we received the letter to absolve the collection after finally being put into contact with an account rep, the name on the letter doesn't even belong to us...</review>< date>

Recently we had our home inspected (we have this done annually by T.Nolan) by the BEST Technician on the planet-- Dena M-- & were surprised by her professionalism & integrity. She thoroughly examined the interior & exterior of our home, discussed her concerns, emailed her recommendations, then scheduled a return visit to spot spray vulnerable areas & then she followed through 100%. AMAZING Customer Service--- and at NO additional charge (at ALL) other than the small annual fee that we'd already paid!!!  Truly Nolan now has a customer for LIFE, thanks to this experience!</Review>

<Text>Started using Truly Nolen a few years ago and unfortunately I won’t be continuing with their services after our contract is up. I don’t really feel as though their services are worth the expense or hassle.

Every few months a technician is supposed to come by to treat the outside of our house. It’s convenient because they can treat the outside without us being home. We just need to remember to take the locks off our gates so they can access the backyard.

Most of the time a technician will randomly show up without any notice and I’m not home to let them in. I don’t get a phone call or notice warning me that someone is coming. I usually find out through the technician calling me saying “I’m at your house right now” and I’m already at work.

In other instances I’ve called to have someone come and treat the inside of my home and end up disappointed with the appointment. The past two times I’ve called to request this, the job wasn’t completed correctly. The first time, a technician showed up and treated the outside of my home and left before I realized they never came in to treat the inside. The second time around the technician sprayed one room and left.

Communication between the office and technician seems to be really poor. The technicians don’t really know what they were sent to do and they’ll just leave instead of checking in when they’re done.</Text></record>

I called Truly Nolen for a second opinion as whoever is contracted with my complex didn't find anything in my home. The original inspector that came was in my home for roughly 5 minutes. I continued to get signs of insects in my house so I called Truly Nolen. They sent out Scott Davidson to do an inspection and he was here for more than 30 minutes and did a full inspection. He found the root of my problem. (Thank God!) He was very professional and went over the options they had. Prices are VERY reasonable. So we set the date and they sent out Chris Barber to do the treatment. Again, very professional and informative. A big THANK YOU to Scott and Chris for being so kind and compassionate! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE guys! 🙂 I will recommend Truly Nolen to anyone needing pest control! 5 stars! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Scott estimated arrival was between 3pm and 4pm. He arrived right at 3pm.

Chris estimated arrival waa was between 1pm and 3pm. He arrived right at 1pm.

Needless to say, they are extremely prompt and punctual!</review>

Like the personal attention of the technicians--definitely 5 stars. Not too happy that I never know what property the technician is serving as the reminder sent to me never had the property address - I always have to call to find out. Only downside of Truly Nolen and the reason they get a 4-star. However, if one has only one property, this will not be a problem and you will like the service.< /text>

I have been a customer of Truly Nolan for 7 years, and have been very pleased with their termite service.  They respond in a timely manner whenever I call them, and provide an annual inspection and service of any termite activity.

This  year, Dena Marschke provided a thorough inspection with extremely thorough treatment of problem areas.  Her performance was professional and timely.  I highly recommend this company.< /Review>

Service varies with the service man. Sometimes he does not come at all. This last time Steve, the service man accused me of accusing him of lying when I asked why the usual proof of service invoice was not left on the door as as been established with my account for 20 years. It took a week of my calling an ant problem in my backyard to make a trouble call appointment. He certainly did not come at the established appointment time but claims without the usual proof of service that he came and didn’t see any ants. I have no idea if he did anything. That is the purpose of an appointment and proof of service invoice with detailed info on the service provided.<//Review>

<user>103861133821681231681< /user><username>Jennifer Shumaker< /username><date>1560003614365<//date><rating>5</rating><text>When we purchased our home a number of years ago and the sellers used Truly Nolen for their termite inspection. At that time we had such great experience we decided to use them again when we sold the property.  So I called and spoke to some of nicest CSR and made the process so easy so.

On the day of our scheduled inspection our Tech Scott arrived promptly and ready for our inspection. Scott was professional and very informative in the whole process. He went over various options with me and pros and cons of each. I was so impressed with his friendliness and education level. He did a through inspection and took the time to talk to me about it.   Then spent the time going over payment options also.

I would highly recommend Truly Nolen and Scott especially to do business with. I will be recommending them all our friends and realtors we know.

Great job Truly Nolen!

<review>Once again, I had problems with my actual service.  My review indicates one star, but if I could, including years past, it would be less. My profile states Saturday’s only as I have dogs needing containment during the service call.  This request is rarely considered and I most always need to reschedule. On top of that, for this last call I was not notified via postcard with a follow-up phone call. This month, the serviceman showed up on Wednesday, 8/28. I am glad I was home; however, I am so frustrated with your service schedules.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>This spring I had an infestation of crane flies, which gathered around the atrium lights and managed to get into the house every time the door was opened.  Truly Nolan took care of the problem in no time.  Now all I have to do is sweep away the dead crane flies every morning, which is no problem at all.  They always address your unique issues and that tends to vary from season to season.  Highly recommended.< /review>< date>

<Text>Truly Nolen has been relied on by my family for 15yrs (or more) & recently handled a scandal of swarming termites in the attic!! I saw one of these effers literally squeezing out of a pin size hole above the staircase wall on our second floor!!! Gross story short, they came out gave us two options and within a week those flying effers were dead/vacuumed out by Truly Nolen! Things are costly these days but there are people, services, and companies who are willing to work with you in order to better help the cause. Thanx TrulyNolen< /Text>< pictures>

Our lease states that tenants cannot contract with outside vendors. The Truley Nolan technician told me to go to hell when I questioned him about when the last time he sprayed the unit. i would not recommend this company for their unprofessional attitude. Plus, the technician was spraying for BEDBUGS which is mandated by California law to be disclosed to the property owner.</Review>< Pics>

I contacted Truly Nolan due to a co-workers mention of their company.  At that time I had a quarterly contract with another pest control company.  I was not satisfied with the other company's service and their lack of customer service. Coincidentally, during that same time period, we suddenly we found ourselves with a mice problem. I searched the company online and reached out to schedule an appointment.  I reached the call center, after explaining the situation they assured me a technician would reach out to me shortly.  I received a call almost immediately.  The call came from Mr. Ricardo Contreras, Mr. Contreras was very professional, courteous and knowledgeable.  After explaining my situation he scheduled me for an inspection within a few days.  Two technicians showed up the day of the appointment.  They completed the inspection and contacted me immediately with an assessment and quote.  The quote was reasonable and I proceeded with the service the very same day.  They secured all possible entrance avenues for the mice.  I have not had any mice issues since then. I am extremely satisfied with the service.  Mr. Contreras has gone above and beyond in servicing my account.  Truly Nolan has exceeded my expectations so much so that I just recently contacted them to complete an additional service, a Termite Inspection.    Mr. Contreras completed the inspection and walked me through the property pointing out the problem areas.  I highly recommend Truly Nolan, they have knowledgeable caring staff and provide great customer service.  They are very accommodating in their scheduling which I appreciate very much.  For anyone looking for a caring, knowledgeable pest control company I  would have to say Truly Nolan is the right company.<//Text>

Hired Truly Nolan with a 1-year contract to rid our home of Rodents (who had caused serious water damage) back in November of 2016 ..... and 8 month later we are still have problems with rats in our home.

The Truly Nolan 1-year contact was over $600 .... for that that they will do their best to find likely entry points and block them up, put out snap traps and glue traps .... and that is it.

I could done that all my self for $50 ..... they have company policy that they can't put bait boxes outside your home.

So for company that drives around in a vehicles that look like a rodent, they can't seem to solve our problem.

Very disappointed with the level of service and results.< /review>

< Review>
I must say, Truly Nolen strives to give excellent service, although they don't always quite get there. Several times service has been scheduled and either no one has showed or the time window was incorrect even though the main office put me on hold to confirm the day/time with the San Diego office and I was SURE about the time/day. They tell me they want to do an emergency service when a trap has a mouse or rat but when the technician comes out to get the dead animal, they either don't have peanut butter or don't have fresh traps to replace one if we had to throw it away due to waiting too long for someone to come. I do want to recognize on employee for his exceptional service, Manny, who willingly goes beyond the standard service if we ask. For example, it wasn't time for our seasonal service but I was noticing spiders in the house so he treated again. He knows where he set the traps, checks them all, always has peanut butter for them and extra traps if needed and even added wire to the edges of our garage door to keep the rats and mice from cruising in. When other technicians are scheduled for a follow-up service, I have to be home to show them where all the traps are or some are missed as my partner doesn't remember them all. A compliment to the office staff: they are always friendly, polite and trying hard to provide good service.
Update on 6-23-19: I also want to acknowledge German, who has been providing regular and excellent service more recently.</Review>

When I started with Truly Nolan back in 2015, I had issues with flying ants and crickets and they took care of the problem.  The service people that come out every quarter (George is my technician) is very friendly and will let you know if there are any other problems that have come up since the previous quarterly inspection.  Great Company!<//text>

<Text>This was a wonderful performance in a quaint, intimate setting.  The improv was seamless and entertaining.  This is well worth a visit on a night out!  This evening, there was a Q&A session afterwards.  What a treat!  These shows are suitable for a night out, as entertainment while visiting L.A., or just to treat yourself!</Text><time>1544970744424</time>< user_name>

<GmapID>0x80c2c0aebd10bc4f:0xe32e384f1d5531cf<//GmapID><Text>The stories that are created here are unlike anything else you will find in Hollywood. This is not improv, this is improvised theatre, with technical improvisers manipulating the lights, sound, and score simultaneously with the actors on stage. It is mind blowing how talented these performers are, and amazing how much they can squeeze out of every scene, including moments of silence. Riveting! Treat yourself as soon as you can.< /Text>< Name>

Teachers support their students, play alongside them and even will watch shows on nights they have off. It's all about doing improvised theater, so it's an ensemble-based environment where I got to really dive deep into my acting skills as well as improvising. (Also the classes are super affordable).< /Text><Date>1493145847509< /Date>< gmapID>

This is a great night out. The shows are rock solid and hilarious. The local bars are small and perfect for intimate chats with great drinks. Take a date. It's awesome.< /review>

I've been studying improvisation for thirty years and I can say without hesitation that Impro is a very special place. First and foremost their main company ensemble is one of the top in the U.S. and likely the world. Their space work, use of language, playfulness to the point of palpable danger, and writer's mindset is as invigorating and refreshing as any good piece of theatre should be. Secondly, as an experienced improviser I was very pleased that I was able to audition into an appropriate level for me and I have to say I was blown away by the skill and talent of the other students there. I love how Impro teaches the improviser to think like a writer; not that they should script the scene, but that every bit of dialogue, movement, and space work should be performed with the idea that the playwright wrote it because it's important... it has meaning. Unlike many other improv schools I've been to they employ techniques that groundbreaking theatre makers use such as Viewpoints and the Circles Of Presence; no wonder they are more and more being regarded as a theatre company and not just an improv troupe!</text>

He is always responsive to my questions, and he has a very organized system for clients to upload their files. Everything has been smooth and clear throughout the entire process, and I know that I can trust him. In addition, his fee is beyond REASONABLE. I can't recommend him enough.

Attorney Irwin Avelino was a great help and source of valuable information for my greencard process from start to finish. He was always quick to answer and follow through with emails and phone calls. His team was professional and always carried out the routines in a timely manner. I would highly recommend Irwin for any immigration needs as he was a great value for his fee and came highly recommended from a friend going through the same process.< /review>

Atty. Irwin Avelino is very good lawyer professional and responsive to all my questions. He helped my mom with her adjustment of status even my mom had a complicated case because she overstayed her B1 visa but with the help of Atty Avelino everything  was very easy and simple. My mom got her green card in 7 months without interview!!! He is very organize and very thorough. I highly recommend Attorney Irwin Avelino.

Upon meeting my soon to be wife in the Philippines, I was determined to live the rest of my life with her in the United States. Right away, I searched and searched many law firms or attorneys that may be able to help with the process. I found Attorney Irwin Avelino through a google search and decided to reach out and asked for advice and if he can help with my situation. After the initial conversation with him I was sure to hire him and his firm to help me with the process of petitioning now my wife here to the U.S.

As of this past Friday, 3/26 my wife and I just had our interview for her change of status for a permanent residence and was approved for her green card.

Attorney Avelino helped with the whole process and made everything worry free and very easy. I am very busy at work and just knew if i hadn't hired him to help, It would have probably prolonged the process for my wife to come abroad. He does all the "heavy lifting", and is very knowledgeable with immigration process and the laws for it. He told us everything that we can expect, and everything was super simple and was hassle free from the beginning. And it all happened fairly quickly. He's also very responsive and attentive to all the questions we had and always responded quickly and professional.

I'd recommend him to anyone in the same or similar situation. Thank you Attorney,

Hands down to the best immigration lawyer, Atty. Irwin Avelino. Without his help and his entire Avelino Immigration Law firm team, I would not have had a successful result in bringing my wife and two children here in the states. Atty. Avelino is very insightful, understands his clients and expert in his craft. He is very responsive to communications, inquiries, and a great listener. A truly professional and marvelous individual. Choosing Atty. Avelino’s service is one of the best decision I ever made. Thank you so much sir and to your entire team. I Highly recommend their services.

For more than the last two years we have been working with Irwin Avelino. Not only does he know immigration up one side and down the other, he knows it from an American-Philippines perspective. We would have been scared to death to do this on our own, but he handled it as though he was a member of our family. We are married now and the one who needs a Green Card just got it approved. There were so many special circumstances in our case that it could have been a disaster - a previous marriage, significant age difference, family challenges, and much more. We only hope that we can get to California and visit Irwin some day.<//Review>

Atty Irwin Avelino  is  indeed the right choice for immigration problem. Very affordable ,expert and professional in handling cases just what he did on my case. I asked several 5 star lawyers and this awesome man is the only one who replied on my case and he did it perfectly. Got my green card already with his help. My previous immigration law firm dropped my case like a hot potato and it was only this heaven sent Atty Irwin who made it to the end with flying colors. I thank God for having him my lawyer. Very accommodating and thorough. This man has a heart and worth recommending  to those who are searching for immigration assistance. You are in good hands with Atty Irwin Avelino. He is the right one for you!!!.</review>

I got my green card today. Thank you, Irwin!
Very helpful and professional service, worth every penny.
Well organized system to manage and compile inputs to formal documents.
Knows what to push and what to be careful in between steps.
Definitely can recommend others seeking both non-immigrant and immigrant visas.</review>

Irwin is terrific. My wife, Zoë, and I worked with him for over two years working to get her green card. It was a very difficult process with many starts & stops, and through it all Irwin was resilient & optimistic while also being realistic & professional. We couldn't find a document; Irwin helped us discover solutions. COVID hit; Irwin constantly kept us updated. Every time we had a question, he answered it timely and with detail. While we're grateful that the arduous process of obtaining a green card is coming to a close, if we had to do it again, we would no doubt choose Irwin. We can't recommend him highly enough.< /Text>

He is professional and very responsive to all of our questions. Positive feedbacks are he is very knowledgable about our case, he provides several tips in preparation for the immigration interview, trustworthy, willing to be flexible with his schedule despite the pandemic, and very optimistic on case management, in other words he encourages and motivates us that our case will get approve. Also, without second thoughts, he lent us a hand on providing recommendations for medical professionals registered with USCIS when we’ve been asked by USCIS to submit medical documents. Areas of improvement is to consider and anticipate every possible factors that might affect each cases to avoid RFE’s (Request For Evidence) from USCIS.

Overall, we would highly recommend his services to anyone. Thank you Atty. Irwin for all of your kind help. You’re amazing!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2c0ff8e29189b:0xd713043d62975589<//GmapID></record>

<Review>Atty. Irwin Avelino is a professional lawyer that is knowledgeable in handling immigration cases for Filipinos.  He response to all our questions in a timely manner through email.  His professional fee is very reasonable.

He helped me process all the paperworks on K1-Visa for my Filipina Fiance.  We have been married over a year and just recently got he Green Card approved.

We are looking forward to having him help us in the near future to bring my wife's kids from the Philippines to the United States.

Me and my wife would recommend Atty Irwin Avelino to anyone who needs his assistance in Immigration Services.

Thank you so much Atty. For helping us get through this process.

Immigration lawyer that you can trust!!! Irwin avelino and his staff was so accommodating and will do their best to help you in your immigration case. He would answer all your questions about your case asap even tho it's holiday or even weekends or even if he is on vacation. He helped me out so much that I can't thank him enough people might say it's his job to do it coz he's my lawyer but he will put all of his effort to file or to answer all your questions. He absolutely gave his best for me to get my case done. So I would like to thank you for all your help making my dreams come through. Godbless you and your staff always and don't stop helping people to make their dreams of being a permanent residents or citizenship possible. Thank you thank you thank you!</review>

I am a professional and can differentiate well between good and bad attorneys, he is an excellent attorney in my short experience with him.

I just wanted to say thank you to Atty. Irwin for taking care of my case! It is always an intimidating task trying to find someone to trust to help with something so important and life changing, but Atty. Irwin made us feel comfortable and confident right from the start. Thanks to his hard work, I got a permanent residence status with such ease. I can’t put into words how you have helped me.

<review>Irwin Avelino,

did a fantastic job with my wife's immigration process. He basically walked us through every step and was there to answer question. The K-1 Visa process went smooth thanks to Irwin's guidance and expertise. I plan to go to Irwin for all my immigration needs in the future. He is truly a professional and a great person. I would recommend him to anybody seeking an immigration lawyer.

Thanks Irwin,

<Text>I have just completed an adjustment of status process from work visa to permanent resident, and was referred to the offices of Irwin Avelino through a third party. From the outset of the consultation I felt no pressure at all to go further or agree to contract any services. I felt able to return and clarify information I needed, and with such a reasonable price for services, I felt very comfortable working together. Irwin was thorough and attentive throughout the process. The regular communication and updates were invaluable and I was able to reach out and gather further information throughout the process, which was of immense value. I had originally planned to go through a preparation website, but I’m so glad I went for the human touch, as for my situation it was beneficial and made the application process far less stressful.</Text><UserId.>100117601151901693107< /UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>My brother lives with me while his family is in the Philippines waiting for their petition. Unfortunately my sister in law passed leaving my brother with 2 young boys.  I hired Atty. Avelino to adjust the petition of the kids since their mother is no longer living.  In 3 months, my brother and his 2 boys came to the United States TOGETHER,   It was a dream came true.  Although, bittersweet success because of my sister in law's 'passing, we are so grateful to God and Atty. Avelino for making this happened.  He is very consistent and prompt in answering all your questions.  He made you aware of the status of your case religiously.  And his price is REASONABLE   I highly recommend this place!!!!<//text><time>1574091451114</time>< Name>

< Review>
Greetings,
To whom this may concern. I am writing on behalf of the Law Offices of Irwin M. Avelino. My experience with Irwin and his Law office was EXCEPTIONAL. I had spoke to Irwin 2 years prior to contracting for his services. When I was finally ready to proceed and after contacting local attorneys here in Florida, I decided to call Irwin again. Irwin kept notes and was able to recall things we talked about from our only conversation two years prior in detail. He was helpful and honest when he didn't have to be and didn't go for the money grab as was my experience with the local attorneys here in Florida. His office was GREAT and everything was done in good time as he predicted. I give my personal recommendation to anyone in need of legal services. All the paperwork for both the USCIS and foreign embassy were PERFECT ! No catch, no going back and forth, NO PROBLEM !
In conclusion the last thing the immigration officer said to my family after the AOS interview was, "You have a good attorney"
Thank you Irwin,
Arthur<//Review>

Attorney Irwin Avelino helped me a lot and gave me a lot of really great advice.
My case was a little bit complicated case but he took care of my Green Card case and I finally could get it last year.
He is really supportive and kindly person.
I don't think I could get my Green Card withouth his advice.
I really appreciate your support and thank you!!</Review>

<review>First of all, We thank God that we found Mr. Avelino to be our immigration lawyer. We strongly believe because of his knowledge of the law and his dedication and willingness  to help others no matter who you are,where you came from and how tough the days maybe he is willing to hold your hands and to see to it that you have someone to help you through your case from start to end. His staff ,especially Ms. Gladys , are all amazing and approachable and will email you and all the things that you needed All our queries were answered timely and accurately. We didn't have any problem with our papers  because the staff and Atty.Avelino himself checked it one by one. They taught us all the things we needed for the requirements and how will the interview looks like and they are always confident that we will pass and we did. We passed all the interviews with ease. We strongly recommend Atty.Avelino to everyone who needs a legal advice from an immigration lawyer.

Atty. Avelino is indeed a blessing to us!!

Many many thanks to Atty. Avelino for handling our case!!
My husband and I were extremely happy and so gratified to have worked with him. He offered and worked above and beyond to assist us through the whole processing of our case. His service was really impressive to the highest extent, not to mention at an affordable price. We were skeptical and didn't know that our case would take that fast but it did, and it's all because of his expertise and knowledge. He was very helpful, precisely informative and very nice and kind as well. He's willing to explain and clarify everything in great and prompt manner! We absolutely have no hesitations in recommending him to anyone. A lawyer with surpassing excellence and outstanding service! He's indeed a blessing to many of us who wish to stay, live and be reunited with our family here in USA!
Thank you so much atty. Avelino! God bless you and more power!!

We just finished and got approved in our K1 up to AOS. No one recommended atty. Avelino
to us only my husband did his own researched through internet and search as "best immigration lawyer for fiance visa" and he appeared as one of them. I only communicate through emails and he replied me as soon as possible. My K1 process from the start up to AOS were all smooth and fast. I recommended and will recommend attorney Irwin Avelino to all my friends and relatives that will need an immigration lawyer in the future. Thank you for the great success of our k1 journey and green card approval and more power to you and to your staff!!!

Sincerely,
Ty and Kathy (Nebraska)<//review>

I interviewed no less than a dozen immigration firms and hands-down Mr. Avelino's was the most responsive and informative to support the immigration process for my future spouse.  From his Firm's website and the interactions I had with him and his staff, the choice was clear.  Through the daunting task of numerous rounds of paperwork and assembly of the myriad of supplemental documents, he personally provided guidance that instilled confidence in his professional expertise.  I did not have a single moment of concern during the process, and this is based on competence of Mr. Avelino and the expeditious actions of his staff.  This made the lengthy evolution simple for us, and ultimately resulted in a resounding success.  It was (and still is) without a doubt, worth every penny.  Furthermore, Having passed the first hurdle of the permanent resident status, we will continue with his counsel in proceeding through to citizenship when the time comes.
I am a 24 year career Naval Officer and accustomed to precision and attention to detail.  In line with my high expectations, I unreservedly recommend the services of the Law Offices of Mr. Avelino and endorse his team with the certainty that you will be equally satisfied with the outcomes as are my spouse and I.</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><user_name>Kamran Zaidi</user_name><Review>Irwin Avelino has tremendous migration attorney skills.  I’ve never known another attorney more prepared or focused.  He has the ability to dissect a case much like a skilled surgeon, with absolute calm.  Nothing seems to rattle this guy or distract him from his goal on a case, which of course, makes him extremely tough to beat.

I used his services for getting E2 Visa , and he handled the case smoothly and diligently and acted proactively on all the issues that might come. He showed his commitment and command as a subject matter expert and as a result me and my family were granted with E2 Visa without any obstacle.

I would like to take the opportunity to thanks Irwin for his friendly nature and professionalism throughout the case. I would recommend him as a great A+ attorney .<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< userid>

I would highly recommend Attorney Avelino as I am very satisfied with his services and the way he has handled our multiple immigration/visa application process. He is very hardworking, thorough and really knows his work.

The selection : It all started last year when my company was looking for an immigration attorney who can help us in the immigration/visa matters, works in the same timezone as we are and easily reachable when we are in need without going through any red tapes. Now, that was a pretty BIG filter criteria so I sort-listed 5 different attorneys from different part of the west coast region and presented my current situation to each of them individually. All attorneys (except Attorney Avelino) assured me I have a strong case and there is no reason for me to get concerned about my application. Attorney Avelino, however, told me an entirely different story based what I presented to him. After some further research based on what I was told, I realized he is 100% accurate about my situation and that's how we ended up engaging Attorney Avelino's services.

Like other reviewers have commented, Attorney Avelino knows in depth the immigration laws and how it would affect our case. He always provides various options at each step and pros/cons for each option with the end goal in mind. He is very professional and at the same time a very genuine person who truly cares for your case. He is very prompt and is always just a phone call away when I need any information. Attorney Avelino is truly excellent in his field!<//review>

<date>1578390109421<//date><rate>5</rate><review>I randomly found Attorney Avelino's law offices through Google and was curious as to how he got the solid 5-stars from all of his clients. Now I understand why.

He returned my call very promptly to go over my sister's case and what options she has. He was very truthful and sincere. After he had given his opinion on my sister's case, he even suggested that I consulted another attorney like a patient would seek a second opinion from another doctor. For me, that says a lot about a person's integrity and professionalism. With the time he spent with me over the phone and the valuable advice he gave me, I was surprised he didn't charge me for a consultation fee although I asked how much it was.

I wouldn't be using any immigration lawyer on my sister's case any further. Nevertheless, I wouldn't hesitate to call upon his services in the future should the need arise in my family.

I highly recommend that you consider him before you get all excited with the sentimental TV ads of the more popular law offices on TFC.

Attorney Avellino, thanks for your selfless time and the valuable advice you gave me. You restored my faith in lawyers.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>When we required an immigration attorney,
Irwin Avelino was recommended to us.
I now know why.
He is by far  the best attorney I have ever encountered.
He is compassionate, understanding, and extremely helpful.
He always promptly returned our phone calls
and clearly answered our questions in language that
those of us who are not attorneys can easily understand.
He is very thorough, very knowledgeable,
polite, courteous, and gave us great peace of mind
in out trying times.
I wish there were more like him.
If you require immigration or related legal assistance,
He's Your Man!
.
With Sincere Appreciation,
Rev. Robert and Mrs. Ryce Cote'</Review>< pics>

Happy to have found Attorney Avelino online 2 years ago. I felt comfortable that I can easily contact him and not have to go through making appointments for questions. Very professional on all our conversations and still felt like speaking to a friend.

I am actually on my next process for immigration and will be looking forward to work with Atty. Avelino again.< /Text>

We are extremely and entirely satisfied with the quality of representation and care that you have given our case.  Through the process you proceeded full speed ahead without delay, even when USCIS dropped the ball and lost papers, you corrected the situation instantly and always kept us informed of every development and answered our emails with expediency.  Shay and I will always be grateful for all this and will not hesitate to refer your services to friends and family.  There would have been no way we could have navigated the entire Fiancé Visa process without you. Thank you so much for your patience and generosity in helping us, you always went above and beyond, in walking us through this process."  Thank You immensely Mr. Avelino

Everything went smoothly from the very beginning there might have been a hip cup along the way but nothing a good deep  breath did not cure and words of reassurance from Mr Avelino , he truly does everything in his power to give you a happily ever after !!! Thank you Mr Avelino for everything you have done for Carlo and I you will always be in are hearts 💕, If anyone is looking for a person  of integrity and strength and wisdom of the profession he is the one , look no further, he will stay with you all the way from start to finish a man of his word and that means a lot in today’s world !!

Atty Avelino has been with me every step of the way. He is an expert on his field. Eventhough the odds were against me on my case, he was able to solve it and at an affordable price. He communicates clearly and quickly. I've emailed him on Sunday nights and he replies in minutes. He always returns phone calls quickly as well. He is honest and told me about the pros and cons regarding my case and the different stages I will go through. Now thanks to him, I have my green card. I tried one of the famous attorneys in the Filipino community that shows up in television but was disappointed with the service and too pricey. Thanks to atty Avelino for doing an impressive job and at an affordable price. I highly recommend him to those seeking immigration assistance.

In addition, I have successfully obtained my citizenship thanks to Atty Irwin Avelino. He has been there with me every step of the way.</text><rating>5</rating><Name>Sags< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<review>In my quest of finding the right immigration lawyer, I stumbled upon Atty. Avelino. He never charged for an initial consultation fee. He is honest, serious and dedicated. Unlike other immigration experts that keeps asking for fees and delivers nothing, Atty. Avelino gives you results and charges only at a minimum. He will stay with you every step of the way no matter how long the case may take. You don't need second thoughts with Atty. Avelino, I highly recommend him. My family and I were so ever grateful we met him. Now, both of my parents are living happily here in the United States.</review>< Pics>

Irwin is one of the very best immigration lawyers in SoCal no doubt. He's very thorough, very helpful, smart, patient and articulate. He anticipates problems before they even arise, he gives you plausible solutions for issues on your application. We did working visa, student visa, dependent visa then of course green card petition with him and although the entire process wasn't always smooth, we never worried because Irwin takes care of everything to the very best of his abilities.

He genuinely cares for his clients and will never dismiss any of your concerns. There might be a lot of immigration lawyers around, many good ones, but it definitely isn't easy to find a lawyer who is naturally kind, gracious and compassionate like Irwin.</review>

He anticipates everything that the USCIS might look for and make sure that it is addressed accordingly. He is very confident and mild mannered...something that makes him stand out from all the other temperamental lawyers in LA. He is very reliable. He responded to all my inquiries via phone or e-mail on the same day. He is very proactive and provides update even before you ask for it. I would recommend Atty.

<review>Looking for the right immigration lawyer is very hard given that there are thousands of them in California alone. Honestly, I have gone through the process of seriously searching for the right one by searching the Google, listing down referrals from my friends, calling each one of them and comparing their opinion about my case. From among the 4 short listed immigration lawyers I have to choose from, Atty. Irwin M. Avelino is EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERIOR from the rest. It is because of his work habits. He is very professional, very honest about your case, prompt in addressing all your concerns, that is, he makes sure to answer all your queries first thing in the morning. He treats clients as top of his priority. He will make sure nothing is left for the immigration officer to ask about the case as he very good and very much familiar about the documentation process. I am so blessed to have him as my immigration lawyer. I strongly recommend Atty. Irwin M. Avelino (with perfect 5 stars) to anyone who is in need of an immigration lawyer. Thank you Atty. Irwin M. Avelino for providing me and my son with excellent professional services.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2c0ff8e29189b:0xd713043d62975589< /GmapID></record>

<Review>I am thankful that Atty. Avelino handled my case for Adjustment of Status. He was always available when me and my husband have questions, answers all our emails and calls.
He is very professional but friendly and approachable. Atty. Avelino might look young but he knows his craft. Proof is in all the reviews here. I am not fond of writing reviews but I owe it to Irwin.
He went the extra mile by helping me with the divorce process which is not part of our contract and didn't charge me for it.

Atty. Avelino doesn't take advantage of his clients financially. When we had a schedule for our interview with USCIS we asked him if he can accompany us to the interview but he said we won't be needing him there as he was confident that we will be approved and we were! I got my green card last week.
Thank you, Irwin!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><gmapID>0x80c2c0ff8e29189b:0xd713043d62975589<//gmapID>< Name>

We haven’t done any personal meeting with Atty. Irwin Avelino. From the start of the consultation until the completion of the processing of the fiancée petition, employment authorization and permanent residence (green card), everything was done through e-mail, yet he accomplished everything efficiently and professionally. During the period of time we spent in submitting requirements, exchanges of communication as he gave us instruction of what to go through, he showed his unquestionable expertise in the services we availed from him. He was very prompt and knowledgeable and we believe that he is truly reliable and trusted as an immigrant lawyer. There were no hang ups when it comes to his services and I would definitely recommend him to our friends who may need the kind of services we availed. JOB WELL DONE ATTY. IRWIN!</Text>

<Date>1483055477161</Date><pictures>None< /pictures><review>Atty Avelino and his staff especially Ismail are one of a kind! Living in the Philippines with my husband trying to find an attorney that would take our case seriously seemed impossible, but Atty Avelino didn't even second guess us when we started to ask (email) him about the process. I am a worrier and stress about every little detail asking hundreds of questions before we even paid our retainer, which most other attys found annoying and tended to only reply if there was a payment, but not here. Atty Avelino was ready and willing to ease my nerves from the get go. He explained everything very clearly and set my expectations from the start. His paperwork was flawless and made the process so much easier as that was the number one reason why people got denied or delayed as we saw when I went with my husband to his final interview. During my husbands medical we came across a bit of a hiccup to say the least and some uncharted territory for Atty, but instead of turning his back on us, his team logged extra man hours to do the research and made what seemed like an impossible situation (essentially getting denied) turn into a definite yes from our consular officer. I am so happy that my mom found Atty Avelino and I would recommend him to anyone. We contacted him in March about our immigrant visa, got married in end of May, got our marriage certificate end of June, Petition approved September, and visa approved December 1,2016. We are truly blessed and are coming to the states February 2017. We couldn't have done it with out his and his teams help. If you want accuracy, efficiency, and honesty then do not look any where else. Thank you Atty Avelino and Ismail you guys are the best!</review>< gmapID>

<review>Looking for a great immigration lawyer in the US is one of the hardest tasks. There are thousands of them just in one location. I have to thoroughly screen each one of them just to make sure I get the best professional legal service. Atty. Irwin Avelino stood out from among the lawyers I have called to seek for preliminary legal advice. I really wanted to thank my best friend for referring Atty. Irwin Avelino. He handled our case all the way to greencard. He is very prompt in answering your questions (You will definitely get an answer within 24 hrs). He really values time. He is very frank, very honest and straight forward about your case. He is perfectionist, very organized, detail oriented, proactive, very much familiar with the documentation process and knowledgeable about immigration laws in the US. He makes sure when a case is submitted to the USCIS, nothing is left for the immigration officer to doubt or question about your case. Processing time for our case (I would claim and compared to some of my friends under different lawyers) is considered to be one of the fastest. This is because of his EXCELLENT and SUPERIOR legal professional service. We are so blessed to have him as our immigration lawyer. I have been referring Atty. Irwin Avelino to my friends and they were all happy about his service. For those, you are still seeking for a perfect immigration lawyer, Atty. Irwin Avelino is the one. Thank you very Atty. Irwin Avelino for all your help and for providing us with excellent and superior professional legal service.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Alexandra and I couldn’t be happier with our choice of Irwin Avelino as our legal representation.  Throughout the course of our filing, Irwin and team were consistently in communication with both of us and updating us as to the progress.  Irwin is a true professional and actually cares for his clients and it truly shows in his work.  We had many options in choosing legal representation, some more expensive or less and some with very well-known names within the community and we couldn’t be happier with the choice we made.  At no point did we feel we were alone in this journey, the team at the office was always there to reassure us of our situation and standing.  Thank you Irwin for making a very lengthy and convoluted process so effortless.  Alex and I truly appreciate your professionalism and dedication.</Review>

We have been working with Atty. Irwin Avelino with all of our immigration needs for 7 years now. He helped my wife from getting her working visa approved, to us getting our green cards into our possession. It has been a long path for us but Atty. Avelino guided us all the way through. He is very knowledgeable and professional with his craft. We never felt like we were being taken advantaged of unlike the other horror stories you've most probably heard of with other immigration lawyers. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND him for all of your immigration needs.

Thank you Atty. Avelino for all the help you've given us.< /Review>

<Text>Irwin is amazing, like family!

My wife and I were so nervous about the process around applying for a fiancee visa and eventually her permanent resident card (Forms, deadlines, terminology etc.).  She just received her permanent resident card in the mail yesterday!  Very exciting and satisfying.

When we started the process, someone I knew, who's Filipino,  recommended one of the "well known" lawyers who deals with people immigrating from the Philippines;  my wife was coming from the Philippines.  I called up that lawyers large office, and was greeted by a secretary who couldn't get me off the phone fast enough.  It was clear I would never meet the actual lawyer who is so well known, I'd be working with some paralegal or some other lawyer.  I was disillusioned and not very excited to work with that lawyer.  My friend suggested, "Hey, if you are going to be paying this person some decent money, you might as well like them."  I made one last search on the internet, and Irwin's name came up.  I called him on a Sunday.

Monday morning, 9:00am I got a call back from Irwin himself.  He concisely and knowledgeably explained to me the steps we'd go through.  He gave me his fee, which was extremely reasonable for all he was going to do for us and even better than the other lawyer I called.  The greatest thing is that Irwin has always put us at ease when my wife and I were confused or just being stress cases ;-)

At the end of the emails, he always wrote, "Contact me if you have any questions"  and he meant it.  He always got back in a timely manner, and answered my questions.  He is a great communicator, kind and very patient.  His staff has been very supportive and prompt to my wife and I for the things that didn't require Irwin's legal advice.

I would immediately recommend Irwin to anyone needing to be taken through the challenging immigration process.

Sincerely,

Michael and Deeta Katz</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

My family just wanted to express our gratitude to Atty. Irwin Avelino. I remember when I found him on google a year ago. I live in Chicago but everytime I have a question right a way he will answer me through calls or email. Atty. Avelino helped my fiancée to come over for just a short period of time. We got married as soon as he got over but we run into a big  problem when me and my husband decided to do the green card on our own.

My husband was denied due to some requirements that we realized we did not submit. I was eight and a half pregnant then and I felt like me and my baby will be left alone here. It has been a year since the last time I have spoken to Atty. Avelino and yet when I left him a message sounded so desperate he never hesitated and called me back right away. He explained to me what supposed to be done and gave us assurance that my husband will be able to acquire a green card. After 5 months we were interviewed and after 5 days after the interview we got his green card.

I am so thankful because if its not because of his expertise our family will not be together. One more thing is Atty. Avelino did not charge me so much.

We honestly recommend Atty. Irwin Avelino for any of your immigration needs. He is a lawyer who has a good heart and very honest. Someone who understands the meaning of Family.

Again we would like to take this opportunity to thank you for all your help.</Text>

My husband and I have worked with Atty. Avelino through the processes of fiance and adjustment of status visas and all cases were handled professionally and efficiently.  We had some red flags with our applications, but with Atty. Avelino's expertise, we were able to fly through the application and interviewing processes and finally obtained a green card for my husband.
Aside from the fact that we live in northern California, Atty. Avelino was extremely attentive and responsive to all of our concerns via email or phone(never taking more than a day) and knew our case inside and out.  He filed all our paperworks in a timely manner and everything went accordingly.  His mock interview for the green card was very helpful and put our anxieties to rest while we were having the actual interview.
His professionalism and charisma is above and beyond what we expected, especially compared to other lawyers we have contacted.
We highly recommend his law firm!</Text>

<text>We got a permanent resident status because of Atty Avelino. We tried contacting the offices of popular atty but none of them helped us. Its either they are too busy from their clients or declined our case to think that they cannot do anything with it.

In our experience, he always got a time to talk with us during the process. He is very approachable and his office got professional staff. He worked with our case professionally and never did we ever felt that he's upto to "money" kind of atty. You can get atty online saying that everything is good and they help you out, but at the end they will charge you high to start with your case. I can't think of any negative comment for his service. Atty Avelino is always on the work even on weekends. My case was rushed due to the NOID from the immigration. You can always get a well known Atty, but never will they have the heart to listen and help you out of the problem. He will be prompt to say what he thinks about the case and give you suggestions or what kind of approach that can be done on the case.

Me and my wife are very happy to have Atty Avelino on our case. Ofcourse he will be the best Atty for us since we got our GC because of him. Thanks Atty Irwin Avelino for helping us out.</text>< pictures>

<review>We were referred to Irwin by a family friend who had worked with Irwin M. Avelino and had a great experience. We couldn't have asked for a better lawyer with Irwin M. Avelino was professional, friendly, dedicated and always accommodating. He was extremely flexible in the times and locations where he could meet us to go over our case, something that highlighted his commitment to his clients. He walked us through every step of the process and made something as daunting as navigating America's immigration system easy to understand and straightforward. Irwin was the reason our case sailed so smoothly and if we had to do it all over again we would pick Irwin to represent us every time without a doubt.

He's the best ever!!! I'm already 3 years here in California and I always run to him if ever if I need to do something in immigration like renewing my greencard. My hubby found him in Facebook and we both Not regret for trusting him right away. He's not aftering about your money but he will do his job until it's done and his price is fixed. It's not like other atty that they keep on calling for another payment again. I heard alot of people who have a problems about there atty.
Atty Avelino his prices are affordable aND you can talk to him if you have problems about your payment.
I am Filipino working in Israel at that time when my Man petetioned me to get fiancee visa. I just remembered everything is just quick and run smoothly ( probably 6-7 months) and after that I'm already here in California. From Israel straight to California. Now my hubby and I we will be 4 years as a married couple this coming August 2017. We're so lucky we found this man at the right time!<//review>

<Review>With all the information available in the internet right now, it might seem easy to file GC paperwork yourself but there are so many things that we would miss without a lawyer even when your case seems pretty straight forward. But that is where the trouble starts. How do you find a good lawyer? Who is not just after your money but available when you have those silly doubts or fears or what ever?

After calling up several lawyers and talking  to them, I picked Mr.Avelino because he was straight forward with his prices, very pleasing to talk to, didn't sound intimidating and I didn't have to pay for the initial consultation. Trust me some lawyers wanted to charge just to talk for the first time about my case. I would stay away from those blood suckers. But Mr. Avelino was friendly, accommodating, patient and listened to my case and gave me the assurance that this will be a piece of cake. His fees were also among the best at least based on the other lawyer offices I spoke to.

He gave us all the information we need and all the forms we need to fill and I didn't have to make several trips or calls to get things moving. The delays were only on my side in bringing the right paper work. He was available on phone when ever I had a question and that helped me move things faster.

All through the process, he made a hectic job look smooth. Once I submitted all the required docs, he barely took any time in going through the docs, verifying them and submitting them. He also called us up a few weeks before our interview to set up a mock interview and helped us prepare.

He pays attention to the smallest things and makes sure we are not missing anything. That gives you the confidence that things will go smooth and so they did. In less than 4 months, my GC is approved. I absolutely recommend Irwin M. Avelino for all immigration cases.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0ff8e29189b:0xd713043d62975589< /Gmap_id></record>

<Date>1406171033120<//Date><rating>5<//rating><review>Once again, Atty. Avelino delivered the BEST experience for my Family. Finally, last July 13, 2014, my Family arrived at LAX Airport and we are once again united as a Family! Atty. Avelino handled all the paperworks starting from the NVC and to the US Embassy in Manila, everything went smoothly and all we have to do is wait for all of His emails and follow all the Instructions. It only took my family about 6 months from the start that Atty Avelino started the processing untill they arrived here at LAX Airport!!! Even most of my Friends were surprised of how FAST Atty. Avelino handled our Case Professionally. We were very Thankfull for His services and I would Highly recommend His Services to Anyone seeking for a Great Immigration Lawyer, Atty. Avelino will handle all cases Personally and I have never spoke to anybody or communicate by email  other that Him during the entire processing.

Atty. Avelino provides excellent services to my Immigration case. He will promptly answer all your concerns to his best knowledge whether by email or he will call you on your phone by himself. I have experiences with other Immigration Lawyers but the best I can get is to speak with their representatives, unlike Attorney Avelino, he will always be the one to speak and explain to you all your concerns and always on top of the situation. I'm very very happy that I have stayed with him in handling my Immigration Cases which provided Great Results and always given me updates throughout the whole process. I am highly recommending the Law Offices of Attorney Avelino to anybody looking for a great Immigration Lawyer. More Power to You Attorney Avelino!!! And Thank You Very Very Much for Your Outstanding Service!!!<//review>< pictures>

To say that this was the ultimate mattress-buying experience of my life would fail to adequately convey my experience.
I entered the store hesitant, certain of what I wanted, but unsure how to find it, when Jason - like a masked superhero - dived to my rescue!
Valiantly he helped me navigate the treacherous terrain of Too-Many-Options, and guided me along the winding path to the final Secret-Mattress-Of-Eternal-Comfort - which, much to my surprise, was not what I had originally thought I wanted, but WAS nevertheless what I was hoping to find (and was still within my price range - yay!)

TLDR: It was really nice. :)</Text>

Our salesperson Doug, was “very” knowledgeable and easy to deal with. We originally walked in to purchase a full size mattress for our guest room and ended up purchasing a new mattress for our bedroom too! Very happy with our decision, PLUS we can pay it off in two years INTEREST FREE! Thank you Doug!< /Text>

Nick the manager is the best!! Not only did he spend a ton of time with our family on a very busy day, he willingly followed up with me at least three times since we mistakenly ordered the wrong size bed (our fault-not theirs)! He never wavered each time I called with a new problem on our end (bed size, delivery reschedule) and even upgraded us to a better mattress. We couldn't be happier with the outstanding service and SUPER beds you'll find here. Thanks Nick!</text>

I have nothing but great things to say about mattress firm. They're helpful, knowledgeable and have excellent customer service! Keep up the good work. I highly recommend Mattress Firm if you are in the market to purchasing a mattress or any sleep accessories. Calling and speaking with a sales associate over the phone versus purchasing over the internet is the way to go!</text>

I called Jason Ram at this store asking about how to get my movable base working again.  It is five years old.  He found the original invoice in the computer and told me what to do to get warranty service.  He and his manager went the extra mile for me. As a result I have encountered exceptional customer service in the warranty service as well.  Thank you, Jason!</text>

My mother in law and my wife and I bought beds the same day.
My appointment was with Nick Bedel, Nick was amazing! We felt more like a family member than just another customer.
With my wife being disabled we have very specific needs and Nick listened intently to each one. We expected this appointment to take a long time due to our situation, but because Nick was so attentive to us we were in and out in less than 2 hours paperwork and all.
We can't thank Nick enough for his vigilance and amazing customer service! I have already informed multiple family members, who really need new beds, this is the place and person to go see.
Nick, thank you again for all you help, patience and understanding!</Text>

<text>We are move out of the Bay Area to up North to a new home. Since living out of apartments and hotels with our Autistic son. We have been coming to what was (Sleep Train) now its Matterss Firm on Blossom Hill & Santa Teresa in San Jose for years. But only bought beds for our son. Now after us sleeping on air mattresses for years. It’s time for us. We deserve to get a bed of our own. That Evening was a date for us. Son with Therapist. Doug at the store was so Welcoming. He gave us great prices & discounts. He was very friendly and kind. There one else there but us. He said it was he closed. We just made it. But he never once told us he was on over time to help us. We were just having a great time with time. He was just like a old friend of the family.  Even though I am moving. I would drive the 5hrs back to order another bed from again I trust him.<//text><Response>{'time': 1596675433155, 'text': 'We appreciate that you would make the trip to see us again!

After the Shelter in Place was lifted and I was able to connect with a sales rep (James/Almaden) who was determined to help resolve my problem my experience went from bad to great.  David/Nick worked to ensure that I was once again a satisfied Mattress Firm customer.  Kudos to at Michelle/Cottle Rd Who got the ball rolling.  Thank you!<//Text>

Easily on of the best sales experience I've had... We were greeted by Doug and he consulted us the entire way through the purchase be demoed a couple beds and also showed us various adjustable frames.. long story short we went out with an adjustable frame a beautiful mattress. We also got a great set of cooling pillows and sheets that has helped me sleep through the hot nights. If I were to buy another mattress I would definitely talk to Doug he's a wealth of knowledge and will get you exactly what you need!< /Review>

<review>5 stars is not enough. Doug deserves 10 stars. He was so knowledgeable about mattresses. I have lower back pain and a sciatic nerve and sleeping on our old matress was very painful. Doug knew exactly what mattress I needed and gave me and my family the best customer service we could have ever asked for. This place is kid friendly they have a table with toys and a coloring area that intertained my daughter while we were finishing up our paper work. Doug had us laughing and really made this the best experience ever. Thank you Doug your awesome.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We knew we needed a new Temper Pedic bed and we have had good experiences at this location when it was a SleepTrain on Blossom Hill. We knew it had merged with another company and were now "Mattress Firm", but we went in figuring we knew what brand of mattress we wanted (Temper Pedic), what type firmness and just wanted 2 adjustable sides of a King. What we discovered was that now there are many more options and types, especially of the bases. I figured we would be turning down anything that wasn't just simply for raising the head and feet. But then salesman Doug Kalpakoff began to really help us. He didn't just ask if we were side sleepers or back or stomach sleepers. He let us know how a choice in a base can affect circulation, sleep apnea issues, how age or weight affects how firm a mattress you want (he did so making fun of himself!). He did so without every pressuring us, but just asking us questions and informing us about the product, even being funny while he did it. He waited for as much time as we needed to lay on the beds and try them out. I seriously felt no pressure, and I will walk OUT of a place that gives me a hint of pressure because there is another Mattress place that sells Temper Pedic just nearby. Not only did Doug really help us understand options, he was so knowledgeable about sales that were going on. We saved more money than I thought we would, and I had already scoped out the sales. He would tell us information, then patiently sit back as we discussed, never trying to push us one way or another. We knew Temper Pedic is the best bed ever, but we didn't know we would love the new options and never would have spent the money if Doug hadn't educated us with no pressure. We are so glad we got the particular Temper Pedic and base we did. Go see Doug - he is worth it!< /Review><date>1580773995166<//date><Name>Robin Winterlin< /Name>< gmap_id>

Richard is a great addition to this store.  Very courteous, we did not feel rushed, and the other staff helped entertain the kids while we tried out the mattresses.  Great success!</Review>

<Review>I took the advice of your salesperson (Jovannah Nieves, who turned out to be the manager of another store!) and got the Bridgewater Luxury Firm mattress for $1400 and found it VERY undesirable. It was way too soft and when I looked for a replacement, the other products either didn't meet my expectations or were more expensive. I returned the mattress and was charged $149 which was totally unacceptable because I was NEVER notified of the expenses in advance. I didn't sign any documents and ordered the product and gave my credit card info over the phone later that day after I visited the store.

PS: The manager called me later and apologized for the whole thing and promised me a full refund of $149. A pleasant surprise!<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Walked in on a Sunday afternoon and needed a same day delivery.  I had an idea form the internet what I was looking for. The salesman was very helpful to show me my options and what was available for delivery same day. I decided on the split king size and tempurpedic Rhapsody Luxe and as they promised delivery was done around 9 pm and setup completed same day.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This SleepTrain is my go to place for mattress and frames. Nicholas helped us in 2014 with a queen iComfort with frame and backboard. We have been very happy and impressed with the quality. We went back last week and got two twin mattresses iComforts ordered for our daughters and had the privilege of having Nicholas help us again. Again we are very happy with the outcome.

Back in 2011 we purchased a frame and mattress from Mancini's that fell apart on us while we slept. They tried to replace it three times with more faulty furniture. The last time they tried the delivery guy couldn't get the frame to stop falling apart.

We have not had any problems with Sleep Train's frames or delivery personnel.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

This is my favorite store during December because they mark everything 50%+ off. I love to write so their pens, pads, and planners are perfect for me.<//Review>

Neat store full of journals and stationary but best items in the store were the lettered mugs and water bottles at the back. Friendly service but they do a lot of upselling at the register.<//Text>

Staff is friendly and store is nice. They sell any kind of stationary things and cute novelty items you might want. It's on trend so you will see relevant items like Harry Potter, MCU, Disney...list goes on! They will also have quick travel items like neck pillows, travel bottles, etc!</Review>

< Review>
Skip the Home Depot!   Needed larger odd size boxes for moving.   Arco's did not have anything as large as I needed but mentioned the large corrugated sheets that came on a recent shipment.   Perfect!!   Sabrina was very helpful and also offered wrap that came with the shipment as well.
Bought four additional boxes in sizes that HD does not offer.<//Review>

I have always had quick and hassle free service at Arco. Sabrina was wonderful with helping me get set up during my move. I recommend arco storage to anyone in the central valley because their facility is always clean, employees are always welcoming and considerate. They do offer water and coffee if you need refreshments during your visit.
Thanks you Arco and Sabrina for being reliable.<//Review>

Anthony is always so helpful and nice. This is definitely my go to for any storage needs. They always help make the process of getting moved in and out super smooth plus the indoor units are great for keeping things way from the weather. Also love the carts for easy moving alone.<//review>

My experience with Arco Self Storage in Manteca was great! Anthony was very genuine, friendly and helpful!!! Please do what it takes to keep this man, and give him a raise or promotion! He deserves it! I also noticed this facility is very clean too. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this store for anyone needing storage... Thanks!<//review>

Arco has been my storage for years but lately it seems to be one charge increase after another. I started out by paying $90 a month and it's Nicole and died its way up through rate increases to 107 a month and to top it off all tenants are being forced to have insurance on their belongings...it's just seems a bit weird how they advertise in low and slowly creep up prices....very shady business strategy...</review>

Very clean with a competitive price. Thanks to Anthony for helping with the setup and answering my questions.

I was worried about having a unit on the second level, but there is a (very easy to use) freight elevator that makes it not an issue at all.< /text>

So far, so good. Facility is clean and easily accessible. The price is right! Many unit sizes to choose from. Numerous carts are available to transport goods to the 2nd floor via an elevator. Wish I would have chosen this place over another local facility first. Oh well. Next time.<//review>

Every where else is so expensive and not very secure. This place has motion sensors cameras that zoom in on license plates and faces. Dolly’s, carts, boxes. Everything you need. And for getting a storage unit we got a gift basket with snacks and free t shirts! We got a 8 x 10 unit for $110! And the second month free! Great experience. They make you feel warm and invited and they’re ready to help you if you need it. I would definitely recommend this place!< /review>< Rate>

I love this storage unit!! Kim and her assistant were friendly, they shook our hands ( hard to find these days) introduced themselves and explained everything in detail about the company, set up, cameras, store hours and pricing. They showed us the unit we were interested in and gave us a very fair price. When I signed the contract they went over every line in detail. We received a follow up Thank you card and gift basket. What more could you ask for? Highly recommend this company. They are a wonderful example of how customer service should be handled today and always. Reminds me of the service I provided when I was in the service business in the 70’s-2000.</Text>

Needed a space ASAP, called and spoke with Tanya, she allowed me to come by and choose which storage would work best. The facility is clean and well maintained. Has advertised 42 cameras- saw a few screens behind the counter to prove it. Facility locks down by 9 pm, no entry permitted . I had read several reviews before choosing this indoor site, and I'm happy with my choice. I would recommend this facility to my friends and family.
Thanks again to Tanya for making this transition smooth.< /text>

Very professional staff. Security is a few notches above your typical storage facility. I particularly love the fact that all units are inside units. The only suggestion I recommend is having a passenger elevator as well because 2nd floor is not ADA compliant. Overall though it still rates top notch.< /Text>

I was greeted by Tanya, she is friendly and most helpful.
Facility is clean and seems very secure.

Overall I'm happy and will certainly use this facility for moths to come.< /review><userid>117090210889843093470</userid><rate>5<//rate></record>

Staff isnt trustable in family situations.  I got this link bc I am the emergency contact for my mother. Yet my brother was allowed to some how manipulate staff. I fully do not believe the man who drove her into suicide by kicking her out of the home she grew up then then robbed her of her inheritance money from the sale. Would tell storage Garrett has full access to the property he was trying to keep from her.</review>

I'm not to HAPPY with Arco storage in Manteca all BECAUSE I was late making my payment and so they did inventory on my stuff and I paid at the last minute and was able to save my storage, well after I bought another LOCK , I went into my storage and all my things were set up like it was on display ready to be sold . Well that was not the problem, I tried to find my 32 inch flat screen Sony TV and it was gone ride along with my house speakers that were in a box brand new gone to.IVE LEFT MESSAGES AND NO ONE HAS GOTTEN BACK TO ME IT'S LIKE " WHO CARES ABOUT TRINAS STUFF" not them ...i know I was late making my payment but that is no reason to take my stuff...maybe some one will  do something now that I had to write a bad review...but other then that, staff Is great and the place is clean .....thankyou, Trina...<//text>

LOVE THIS SPOT, THE OWNER IS ALWAYS MAKING SUER ALL THE WASHING EQUIPMENT ARE IN GOOD WORKING CONDITION, THIS SPOT HAS A VERY FAIR PRICE FOR WASHING CARS & THE VACUUM USE, VACUUM WORKS VERY WELL... THIS IS THE ONLY SPOT I KNOW IN LONG BEACH THAT HAS A WATER SPOTLESS RINSE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!!!<//Review>

I've been coming to this nail salon since the beginning of the year and they are amazing! Countless times I've walked in right before closing and they always take me for a set and pedicure which sometimes takes nearly two hours. The staff are so, so welcoming and friendly. The ladies and gentlemen take their time and pay close attention to detail. I absolutely LOVE this salon and wouldn't go anywhere else in Long Beach!</review>

<text>I went in for a fill with a gel mood color nail . My nails were coffin when I arrived they made them square (box) The nail tech cut my nails all the way down changing my entire shape. The boss tried to refile them and they couldn't even be shaped into a narrow nail. Then to make matters worse they didn't fillable of the nails down to the cuticles.  Smh I let them finish the polish but that wasn't done rt either I had to tell them to put polish the side and edges of the nail.< /text>< rating>

Mike did my nails. Right after gluing the tips i told him one was crooked.  He said  oh ok ill fix it. Yet he didn't.  He kept getting up while foing my nails to help other customers that had just walked in. So he took  for ever to finish. And my nails look awful.  The way he painted my nails was awful as well because he was so in a hurry to get the next person in the chair.< /Review>< gmapID>

We love the staff and owner.  Always so pleasant.  We would like fresher polish, I bring my own.  My gel nails last a good two plus weeks.  My pedi does not chip and always looks fresh.< /text>

<Review>Clean. Nice staff. Great pedicure. Terrible job on my gel manicure. She did that obligatory "I'm going to touch each nail with this tool" thing, used NO cuticle softener or oil before hacking away at them, then when she got paint on my skin and let it dry in the light, tried to pick it off with the cuticle cutter, cutting into my skin. Paint is bumpy and uneven. Love the color matching gel and regular, but not enough to come back or recommend.</Review>< Gmap_id>

I’m no Musubi connoisseur, but the Supreme was very good. Rice was well cooked, and the taste was on point with crumbled pork rinds on top. My wife is a very picky eater and she loved it. The only bad thing from our visit is the fact that we didn’t order more. Take out was fast and the owner was very kind. I’ll def return.<//review>

<text>Owner is very enthusiastic and you are greeted with a smile by the staff. Best Poke in town and Best Boba in town. I highly recommend the oolong tea with cream top. I like mine at 50% sweet but ymmv. 10% off for students with id and 2 for $5 drinks after 7:30pm.

My only complaint is the poke is a bit limited in choices but everything else is on point! There's also a secret menu :)<//text>< Pics>

A good place after classes to hang out and get a good bite to eat. Great food and vegetarian friendly. And they have a tea I particularly like (Apple-Tea-ni), which is surprising because i dont usually like tea. The staff are super friendlyand helpful</text>

<review>I eat here at least once a week.  The poke bowl is always fresh but you have to try the tacos.  The wonton shells are so crunchy and the mix of salmon,  tuna,  spicy crab,  and garlic shrimp and sweet house sauce is my favorite.  Try the teas too with boba. So many choices you have to go back often ro try them all.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

There are so many ways one can customize one's poke bowl to fit one's personal tastes, from the meat to the toppings to the sauces. It may seem overwhelming for a new customer, but the staff were really patient and friendly. I also ordered the caramel boba tea, which was a good size and had a good taste. I would 100% come back to eat here again. I had a good time chatting and eating here. The location was very clean and neat.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Best tasting poke in Stockton. Very fresh, melt in your mouth fish. They sourced quality fish and sliced it properly so there is no gritty taste. We went during Restaurant week in Stockton. Small bowl of poke with one poke taco and a cream topped tea drink for $15. A good deal if you can still get it.

In terms of the portion size, I've had better elsewhere in the bay area and even tri-valley. The scooper they use was smallish and the scoop was not very large. The combo meal made me wanting more food as I wasn't full. They offer a large sized bowl but I didn't see a larger size bowl at the counter, instead it's 3 scoops for small and 4 scoops for large for a buck more. I'd pay more for a larger portion size.

Their fish is melt in your mouth good. The sauces they put on has the perfect amount of flavor. Their spicy items are not spicy at all but that's the way I prefer it. If you've ever had Boiling Crab, their spicy is like mild level at BC.

Their tea is the bomb. Any cream topped tea they offer, get it. Honestly their tea quality ranks up there with the best and it's good value. They have these awesome cups with a cap when you get cream topped foam with your tea. It seems like a lot of people just come for their tea.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

They have created a space that is both Instagrammable and comfortable while serving up food and bubble tea that makes you want to return again and again.

They even have live music nights and other events that they post to their social media outlets to keep people up to date and often run specials on new menu items to help spread the word and encourage people to try something other than their favorites.

This place has also become a great spot with the KETO diet everyone is going on. You can order the poke salad bowl and avoid the carbs. They have also started adding some chicken options and spam musubi for people who aren't fans of raw fish and with every new menu item comes big flavor.

Make sure to join their rewards program to receive special discounts and free food and teas from time to time.< /Review>< rate>

<review>I only picked up a menu. It was too confusing. I'm old and unfamiliar with this concept. My daughter said it's like Chipotle, you build your own bowl as you go down the counter. It's a bit pricey and then there are add-ons like avacado. I still want to try it< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< Review>
I absolutely love this place. The staff is so attentive and friendly. Its a cheaper alternative if you have a sushi craving. Poke bowls are always a hit... You chose your base (rice or greens) and either 3 or 4 scoops of fish depending on the size. I love the spicy tuna, shrimp and salmon. Spicy crabmeat is also and awesome topper, and i always get spicy everything! Dont forget about the teas! I usually choose tai tea w a cream top. I could go on forever about this place.< /Review>

For 14 dollars of a “large scoop” I was hoping to get more that three chunks of fish within every scoop. Just not That great of portions.</Text>

If there was an extra start I would have select it. Nevermind the ambient, this a family owned hut, and the food is so good, I need to take a nap after it. So humble so courteous. I wish I can eat there every day. But I'm only a visitor.< /Text>

<review>Chili fries. No this place does NOT serve chili fries, but that's what we were looking for. We had ventured out for chili fries, but we ended up finding this place. We had the best tasting  food from a small authentic feeling restaurant. I would imagine it would be the equivalent to the authenticity one would find in their favorite local taco shop. The staff was very friendly and upfront, they recommended the lamb sandwich and advised it would take 20 min to make but would be worth the wait. However we decided to have the chicken and beef sandwiches (which also came highly recommended)with 4 falafel, and some of their house made baklava. In a word, Amazing. Will definitely back for a plate with the lamb next time. The food came quickly and included some really good sauce on the side to be honest it was 2 different ones and believe sour cream of.some sort.. The menu had a great mix of foods available, the cool part is this place had quite a few vegetarian options as well.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2QsPiyd4zDJ9rP9wYfnN4srhs3OvZ6oGH9SpZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpAt1wUww7G01Fbc7S2qD0vYthn0SvrxQG9Xqg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

<text>The food is good but the prices are misrepresented online vs in-store. A meal that according to the menu posted on google should've cost me at the outside 20$ ended up cost 32$. Thats not in taxes. I also over paid about 3 months ago when I came in and clearly it hasn't been attended too. Thats not fair to the customer. I did say something to the owner. He blamed it on his IT guy and said he had covid. Ok? For 3 months 🤨. Iv had covid was over it in 2 weeks. If he's layer up in the hospital I hope he gets better. But in the mean time FIX YOUR ONLINE MENU PRICES!!! I will edit my rating once its been attended to.🧐<//text>< Pics>

Really good falafel at a fair price. The humus is good too. Love their warm pita made in house. I've tried their vegan milkshakes as I can't have dairy products and it was delicious. Everything is fresh and tastey. I highly recommend it for takeout<//Review>

<review>Service can be slow, and the location is small, but this is the best shawarma place I've found. I think the slow service comes from actually having your food prepared when you order it, and everything I've tried has always been delicious. And they're open late.</review>< pictures>

Sahara Falafel is the best Middle Eastern food I’ve had.  Delicious flavors, fresh ingredients, hospitable service.  We enjoyed the falafels, beef shawarmas & fresh hummus with pita. The owner Mahmud has an inspiring story.  Sandy brings joy to the whole place.  Highly highly recommend</text>

<text>A friend of ours told us about this place that food was good .So we drove 65 mile one way to come and give it a try. Boy oh boy was he wrong . The chicken Shawarma had zero flavor no salt or seasoning at all. The rice was so hard the salad had no dressing.  Consistency of the food is not there.  Our friend told us sometimes  the food is ok some times its very disappointing. The chef changes often . The bottom line is that I will not come back.nor will I recommend any to come here.<//text>< time>

Love this place! Stop by today to get their vegetarian plate! Great food! Fresh produce! High quality Ingredients! Looks like a Decepticon took over his Web Domain so prices do not reflect website vs In store! I would call ahead if you need to know actual prices!< /text>

Nice clean and cozy place with the very respectful owner and staffs. They made the delicious food with fresh material. You can have a nice experience of real and original middle eastern taste and flavors . You can choose from falafel and gyro and kebob and a selection of drinks plus hot tea with mint . Highly recommended. thank you .< /text>

The two stars are for the service and the restroom. Literally the driest chicken shawarma I have ever had in life. You can see it in the photos....it's pretty sad. My friend got the lamb which was bomb. Honestly I really wish places consistently offered good dishes for all of their food, but most have signature items I guess.< /Text>< pictures>

Best Mediterranean food I've had since I was in Tel Aviv. Delicate spices with nice choices. On menu. There is one spicy condiment offered. Friendliest and most welcoming place where I've had the pleasure of dining.</Text>

<review>Good and tasty food experience.
I was near by getting construction supplies Found this place using Google maps. Wow what a find. Granted this is just my first time here but I found the staff friendly, helpful and the food appetizing and Bountiful. I ordered the Kafta/ lamb kabab plate. I wanted to try their Tabbouleh so I asked if I could get some on the side, the lady taking my order said that she could substitute the salad for the tabbouleh. So instead of gouging me for some extra money, my order was exactly what I wanted. When my order came, to say that it was generous is an understatement. The food was delicious and I had enough left over to  take home for a full supper. The tabbouleh had a fresh crisp taste.  The seasoned lamb was really good, along with the hummus Style condiments.
Hopefully my next visit will be just as gratifying.  I will need to make another excuse to go to the supply store.< /review>< gmap_id>

<text>Absolutely delicious and open late! We were coming home from a fun night with friends and needed some late night food. I got the falafel sandwich and my husband got the lamb sandwich. We shared a portion of babaganoush. It was very tasty, very fresh and made to order. We just stumbled upon that place because we needed something open late but now we're definitely coming back. Very good food. Loved it.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>I am absolutely starving, my knee is blown, can't drive so I order grubhub.  I received a plate of ROCK HARD rice, I'm absolutely appalled because they knew they were sending this food out.

The rice was so dry it was a yellowish brown color.  How can you do that to a human being?  Knowingly send food that is not edible?

Now I'm out $30 bucks and I'm still starving.

This lady couldn’t stop looking at us. I asked for no onions three or four times and gave me onions. I asked for extra sauce and didn’t get it. The sauce was good and pickles but the meat was dry. It costs too much. I spend too much money there. Then there were like three people that came after us and they all got there food first. I will not be returning. Reviews and internet tricked me</Review>< pictures>

The meat was dry, no flavor.
The service was bad I didn't even get a tray for my food.
They loaded the pita bread on my friends tray and didn't even bother giving any silverware.

Dont waste your money eating there.
Food should be enjoyable and unfortunately I enjoyed nothing there.</Review>< user_name>

<review>We have been going for years. Out of all the shawarma I have had in my life, Sahara falafel has the best. I am also not a falafel fan, however they have really good falafel.The customer service is amazing as well. Definately recommend to go.< /review>< pictures>

<text>We had party of around 9 people we done our order of 12 items we also ordered fries but they had none and after you pay you can’t get a refund. I had an order of a chicken shawarma on a plate everyone else got their food (who ordered as sandwiches)then another party of 6 came they ordered the same as me they got it before me we asked how long it would take they said it’s on it’s way the rest of my party received their food but I was still waiting it had been an hour since we came and I was already hungry we brought out the receipt and showed the guy he was telling us that we got all our food but we showed him what we ate and their was a missing plate. IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR U TO COME HERE< /text>< Pics>

Great late night food. Middle Eastern food with deserts.  A little early pricey depending on your order or inexpensive if you just want a falafel sandwich.
Not a fancy place but tasty and open late for that high quality food when you are getting off late from work or school.< /text>

I didn't get the name of the balding guy that took my order but he was disgustingly rude.

He kept giving me this are-you-done-yet attitude as he looked down upon me and my friends from the register.

Been coming here for a while and it's a shame to see such poor customer service and a decline in the quality of the food

Don't waste your time here. Go to Z &Z instead.<//Text>

Owner extremely nice.  Mom and pop type place.  Authentic food.  Don't be bothered by the attitude of the staff.  Different culture.  Food is super delicious.  Got the veggie plate and falafel.  Extremely pleased.< /Review>

Wow I stopped by to get a quick bite and man I was impressed. Not only by the quality of the food, but their service, and the amount of food served.

The place seems a bit unclean but it’s not so bad that it ruins your appetite. If I had a choice, I’d stop by again for a quick bite.<//Review>

Delicious home made falafel and amazing chicken kebab (sandwich). The husband and wife team put love into their food and it’s relatively cheap the sandwiches or gyros costing around $7 and most of the shawarma plates about $11-13. Definitely one of the yummiest I’ve had in a while< /review>

Beef/chicken Shawerma plates or sandwiches always hit the spot at Sahara. Their grape leaves are one of the best you will find in all of Orange county and tend to be sold out if you go later in the day. The falafel with tahini sauce is amazing as well  The seating capacity is limited but they offer a solid to go service which people take advantage of.

Small, hole in the wall place with excellent food! The hummus is fresh and tasty and I love the mixed kebab plate. The falafels are also amazing - not too oily like most places. We have ordered catering from them and they worked with us to customize our order. They have decent size portions.< /text>

Food was good but the heat of the restaurant made it so unbearable (90 degrees indoors 95 outside) we got the food Togo and ate in a shady breezy park which was much more comfortable.<//Text>

The food is fantastic and they have good sized portions. Stop here after a day in Disneyland. You won't regret it.

The staff is rude and have a attitude. They need to be more friendly/Courteous to the customers.
I have visited the place a few times and noticed that the elder gentleman (The Owner) is courteous and friendly.
However the rest of the staff is rude. I will not go to this place again.</Review>

<text>One of the original pioneers in the so called little Arabia district. Same fast service and great chicken and falafil sandwiches. They changed how they do their kifta, which is a lot more moist and juicy now. The owner is a hard working man who talks to his customers and if ever asked for something is eager to help.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< userid>

<Review>Open late. If want a good meal then this is where you go. The shawerma, falafel, and stuffed grape leaves are great. Get a dinner plate that comes with rice and hummus. Just a perfect meal and way better than a fast food joint at the same price</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I'm originally from Detroit and spent a good amount of my Saturday nights in nearby Windsor, Ontario.  One of the best parts of that experience was being able to get some killer Lebanese food while watching Hockey Night In Canada.  Well, after driving down Brookhurst after running errands in the area, I noticed the sign for Sahara Falafel and was like "Hey, why not?"  I walked in on a Saturday night, saw they were playing Hockey Night In Canada on the TV, and immediately knew I was at the right place.  The service wasn't fast, but it was friendly and personable.  The food was awesome and left me feeling beyond full.  The beef shawarma plate was great and the option to substitute hummus for baba gannoush was very welcome from my perspective.  All and all, I found it to be quite enjoyable and will definitely be back in the future.<//text>

Their falafels are the bomb dot com! They so delicious I always stop by for their falafels wrap and sometimes their falafel plate.
Forget about their shawarmas, their falafels are the sheet!<//text>

The best Shawarma and Falafel I've ever had. I get the combo Shawarma sandwich everytime I go and never get tired of it. Everyone working here are very friendly, and a lot of fun to watch soccer with when they have it on TV. Sahara Falafel is a must try.< /Review>

<review>This was my first visit with 2 more friends.
Service was good! The employees were very nice. Karim treated it with free falafel, which tasted great!
Beef shawarma was excellent. Chicken shawarma tasted very good, but was a bit dry (may need more tahini or garlic mayo).
Tabbouleh was fresh, but needed some more salt that we added it to it, as well as more lemon juice.< /review><name>Abrar Thabit</name><rating>4<//rating>< date>

Just OK!  You can smell the oil, when you walk in, that they fry the Falafel in is kind of burnt and old.
This place used to be much better before.<//review>

You guys need to wear a hairnet. Many people will be disappointed if there is hair on their food. It will look disgusting and bad for the restaurant. You guys need to look clean and neat.<//Review>

If only i can give them million stars! OMG!! okay if you were raised up in Amman you will know what im talking about, their shawarma sandwich is exactly how they make it back home. The pita they’re using is small and filled with shawarma. Their garlic sauce is so good🤤 the place is NOT fancy yet its very comfy. The owners are cooking food in front of you and are friendly. If i come back to Anaheim im definitely gonna stop here to get shawarma and try their other food!!!!< /Text>

One of our favorite stops!  The food is always cooked just right and the flavors are spot on. We have been going to Sahara for years and never been disappointed. The available seating is a bit small but since we always get it to go it's never been an issue for us.<//text>

This is one of the few places you can actually have such sharwama, it is really very rare to have a fresh beef sharwama, the staff is really friendly, the place is clean but do not except a fancy place, the prices of the shawarmas is quiet high but well deserved.</text>

Let's just say it's edible. Food wasn't bad but had better or could be better. Wanted the chicken and beef shawarma but they ran out of the chicken so just ended up getting two shawarma plates.

at the end of the day id come back because they are open pretty late<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dd29bb5f1120c9:0x157f44563673fadf<//gmapID></record>

<text>I don't understand the bad reviews.  Sounds like someone just trying to be malicious or something.  I think the food here is excellent.  Everything I've had so far I have been very satisfied with.  Ive had the chicken, beef, hummus, salad, tabooleh, kabobs, sandwiches, even the deserts the sell on the side are awesome.  I'm not Arabic so I am even more picky when it comes to great food and this place has just that.  I might say that some of the menu items are a little pricey but the food is worth it.  I definitely recommend this place.  For those of you looking for a date night, this place is definitely not that.  The dining area is extremely casual but not in a bad way.  It's just not a "date night" kind of place.  I give the food here two thimbs up.  I've eaten here about 10 times now and will keep going back.  The guys don't speak much English but they are friendly.</text>< Pictures>

The tabooleh tastes like a grass , Overpriced and the quality of the food is not worth the prices  , the employees there needs proper training on how to deal with customers< /Text>

<Name>Michelle Derak<//Name><review>You may not get met with a smile and a warm greeting but the quality and taste of the food make you forget that the minute you start eating!
I have never had a bad meal there and I have been 20+ times and counting.

This is carefully and freshly prepared food and the meat is amazing. My favorite is the Kofta (lamb) plate which can feed 2 easily or if you're really hungry you can make a night of it!
I have had the falafel and it is equally as good.

Great place to eat and the price is a little more than you would typically spend on take out food, but you get what you pay for here!
(I did use the bathroom once and there was no hand soap & it didn't sit too well with me, but I keep going back)< /review><response>None<//response>< time>

The best Falafel I did taste after I moved to Cali. Amazing food. Hummus and the salad too very bery tasty. It is a very small place. If they could do some changes to the ambience part, it would be wonderdul. Would visit again definetly. Not too expensive, economical.<//Text>

< Review>
I was not a happy camper at Sahara Falafel. I expected Middle Eastern food that would exceed my expectations, especially seeing as how its situated in Little Arabia. Sadly, that was not the case. I have had many Chicken Schwarmas in my life (at other places, even more Americanized Middle-Eastern joints,  and the one I had here at Sahara Falafel was the worst one I ever had. The pita bread was dry and the chicken was dry and had way too many spices on it!! The spices were so overpowering in my food and on my tastebuds; I had to rinse my mouth with Listerine three times to get rid of the taste of the terrible food. I feel extremely disappointed and strongly feel that I was incredibly mislead by all of the positive reviews I read on Yelp.</Review>

Cashier was rude and pushy.  I was way over charged and I have never ordered hummus, foul aND falafel and not get some kind of thing sauce or pickles.  I got nothing.  I was told everything is made from scratch but it was actually fresh from a can and the falafel was made from a box.  $37.00 went to waste.  Never will I eat there again<//Review>

The one main owner is a nice enough guy, but every other member of the staff will openly laugh at or make jokes about you in Arabic if you don't speak it. Food is good most of the time, but dont let them fool you, most things like pita breads, sauces, hummus etc. is not made in house (or at least doesn't taste like it is). Along with the food being just ok, it is waaaay overpriced for what you get. Very easy to walk out of here paying over $40.00 for two plates and some falafel peices. Only good for 1am shwerma or falafel cravings, otherwise I try to avoid coming here.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) This is a delicious restaurant in OC.👍🏻😋
It's a little far from my house, but it's delicious and cheap.Dessert is too sweet.😋
togo 15 minutes.🚘
We call and order in advance.☎️
This is a 15-minute drive from home, but it's a shop where you sometimes post and eat.
It is a restaurant called Sahara.
It's Middle Eastern food. We eat lamb.
It doesn't smell and the meat quality is good.
Surprisingly, it is a restaurant.
The salad, bread and sauce are very delicious
Some sauces are a little spicy.
Taste it beforehand, and it tastes better if the two sauces are rotten.
There is rice underneath the meat.
I think rice is not white rice, but Middle Eastern rice?
You can choose any food.
It's really delicious if you eat it with bread and meat.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
There are not many calories.
There is also a dessert, but it is very sweet.
Please go one by one. Recommend 😋😋😋

이곳은 집에서 차로 빠르면 15분거리이지만 가끔씩투고하서먹는가게에요.
사하라라는 식당입니다.
중동음식이구요.저희들은 양고기자주먹어요.
냄새도안나고 고기퀄러티도 좋습니다.
의외로 맛집입니다.
셀러드와 빵 그리고 소스까지 아주맛있어요
소스는 조금매운것도있습니다.
미리맛보시고 소스두가질 썩어드시면 더맛있어요.
고기밑에는 밥이깔러있습니다.
쌀은 흰쌀이 아니구요 중동쌀?인거같아요.
모든음식 선택가능합니다.
빵과 고기같이먹으면 진짜맛있어요.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
칼로리도 많지않습니다.
디져트도 있는데 엄청 달아요.
한번씩 가보세요. 추천합니다.😋😋😋<//text>
