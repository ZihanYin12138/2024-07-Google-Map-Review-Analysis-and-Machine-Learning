I recently had repairs done on my brand new Mazda 3 and it looks like it just rolled off the showroom floor. Their quality work is matched by their customer service. Matt is the best. The work was done ahead of schedule and he went out of his way to arrange a rental car for me making my overall experience very pleasant and worry free.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80e8292c49d7561d:0x6c6eb648a92481fb</gmap_id></record>

3-2-19 Update to review - I would probably now, check out more body shops before taking to Star.  Since having it home and seeing that their "post work" car wash included ??  - idk what, because the magnet I had taken off prior, the dirt imprint was still there.  And it actually looks like they fixed my old door and did not buy a used door as was paid for (but kept the insurance money) because one of the dents up near my door handle is still noticeable at a certain angle, and the probability of another door with such a dent would be miraculous.  Then, there was tape goo on the inside of my windshield and masking tape left on the underside of my door frame - but still facing outward so you could see it - (Not very good attention to detail).
So now that I've had time to ponder the little things, (that make a Big impression), and the fact that they could have kept it longer to take care of those things, I'm disappointed.  As for the door, I really should have asked for the parts back so that I knew for sure it was taken care of.  As of now, IDK if my safety bar inside the door is still bent or not... so am I safe?
I'm not saying there bad, but I am detail oriented and expected more.

Initial review - would definitely take it back to Star if I need more work in the future.  The quality of work was excellent.  Paint match is awesome.  There was a small chunk of my inside door seal missing at the bottom, that I wish they'd have seen and fixed; But, they did re-stripe the other side of my car so it would match, guess I can't whine too much... very happy about that.  Overall, an A for Awesome!</Review>

I’ve taken my car to a handful of different body shops to get quotes and just to meet and see who would be taking care of my car. My car doesn’t have much damage just needs a new bumper, hood, and headlight. All the other body shops have givin me a reasonable quote after inspecting my car thouroughly and explained to me what they would need to do. Until I brought it to Star. I had my car towed because it is illegal to drive without both headlights. After my car arrived someone looked at it for less then a minute while it was 5 feet off the ground on the tow truck. Said it had major damages that would cost 5,000 which is a hell of a lot higher then everyone else has quoted without even inspecting my car. They were all super rude about it too and mentioning that they can’t trust everyone that pays cash and even giving a few examples to why. So if you need body work done to your car and you decide to pay cash and not go through insurance Star auto body is not the place to go! But I would recommend MyWay auto body! Owner came to me checked out my car and gave me an awesome price ! I won’t ever use star with or without insurance after this experience</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< name>

<Text>Read entire thing its still less time then Star Auto body will waste you.I had to take my car back in twice after they called and said it was finished. They were repairing a dent in my rear quarter panel. First time, Somehow there was still a tiny dent on my (new)gas cap and light scratches from the accident still on my bumper. Insurance paid for it all. So I brought it back and they fixed scratches and hand pushed the dent "most of the way out". They claimed to have no idea about the tiny dent. Stuck with that by the way. Better than the huge dent from the accident no doubt. But still come on guys, right? Over the weekend I noticed some interior pieces laying around the back seat. I figured eh I can pop these on myself probably. But then i saw my rear seat belt was laying on the car floor. After inspecting further I found an inside bumper piece laying on my back seat too. So I came back in this time they seemed annoyed to see me. But I'm sorry, the work wasnt done. Matt and this bigger guy with a mustache checked it out. I even handed them the bumper piece. They took my car and all was well 5 minutes later. No apologies for me having to come in again. No have a nice day.. just "here ya go before you could finish your coffee" I was happy and left. Went to pop my rear seat back up and what do I find??? The bumper bracket..again! Tbis time it was shoved underneath my rear seat. I called in after and asked for matt. After 5 minutes on hold, tbey said he was too busy to speak to me. So I told the lady what the issue was. She seemed very caring and almost as upset as I was about my bad experiences there. She said there was no excuse for this. To bring it back in and theyd take care of it. Oh and Matt blamed the window guys for leaving all my interior stuff undone. So they literally owned 0 responsibility for anything til I spoke to that nice lady. I'm sure when tbey read tbis she will know who she is and i thank you. But because of everyone else. I will never be back and i highly suggest anywhere else. Also with the help of my uncle took apart my bumper and they just never put the left bumper bracket back on period. They probably would have lied to me about that too.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE TO THIS SHOP!!!. They take advantage of their customers. Even though my repair was done through an insurance claim, I received my vehicle back to me with dust throughout the car, broken interior panels, broken runner boards, damaged interior door panels, and property damage to my subwoofers (damaged cone and ripped surround). Upon questioning the work performed, employees lied to me about removing interior panels and damaging them. As one who has worked in the automotive industry for 8 years, I could see through these lies. I pointed out missing interior panel clips, broken plastic from over-torquing screws, and scratches throughout interior panels that were removed.The manager confronted me, screamed at me and threatened me (which who the hell threatens your customers) because I pointed out all the interior damage done to my vehicle. he then accused me of smoking in my car and that was where the damage came from HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DAMAGED PANELS AND SMOKE?! What a great way to be professional and to treat your customers-dick.  I will Never take a vehicle to this shop again. My insurance company thus far sent out an adjuster and we are in the process of taking them to court. Make sure you do not get taken advantage of these people. Not to mention that they claimed they replaced my vehicle with OEM parts and upon further investigation, the parts that were replaced were aftermarket. So they charged the insurance company as OEM parts. They are committing fraud towards insurance companies to make more money. Makes you wonder how many customers' vehicles they damaged and took advantage of. NEVER TRUST THEM THEY WILL RIP YOU AND YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY OFF!!< /Text>

A year or more ago they were one of our favorite and most reliable shippers. Always on time at worst, and even early a lot of the times. Then, suddenly, they went to a snail's pace. Often averaging an hour or more per pallet. Recently they seem to have shaken something up, as the times have been drastically reduced, so the three stars is tentative. We'll see if they can retain the changes.</text>< pictures>

<Text>I went to the admin office by mistake and the lady who answered the door, Christina I believe she said,  was so incredibly rude and foul mouthed even. When I finally got to the right place, they were nice and the products were fantastic. This should have been a 5 star rating.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>TIP: If you call shipping to ask if you can come in early for your appointment and they say it's okay, get the person's name you spoke to on the phone. One of the guards here likes to play games with you when you arrive at the gate! He will turn you away and tell you to come back at your appointment if you don't know the person's name you spoke to and the prick won't bother calling inside to confirm if you actually were told to come in!
He will just look at you with his cheesy smile and tell you he don't want to get fired for letting you in.< /text></record>

<Text>for the last couple of weeks all members have been forced to workout with no shade in really hot temperatures including elderly adults keep in mind 90% of the people here are consuming pre-work out or some kind of caffeine product. Although we drink water exposure to the sun for long periods of time is  dangerous and harmful which makes you more prone to de hydration and heat strokes. I have addressed my concern to the staff after watching a elderly lady nearly collapse in front of my own eyes they seem to not grasp the severity of this matter.</Text>< GmapID>

Very shady company. Lots of hidden fees. Have you ever heard of a downgrade fee? Well this place that and many more. I thought the towel fees were bad. And guess what? Throughout the pandemic we weren’t getting the full access they promise you at signup but you still got charged FULL PRICE!
It’s as if the gym and the bill collector part of the company are two separate entities. Your loyalty is not rewarded as you can be there for years and they give the promos prices to everyone EXCEPT YOU. So if they’re not doing a promo just don’t even bother signing up. And even then watch out because they have close to a $100 fees at sign up.  That’s the price you pay regardless of the pretty promo price they shoot at you. And if problems occur with your billing almost no one at the gym can help you to fix a simple problem and you have to take time out of your day to schedule an appointment with someone who can. Their gimmick is that they’re affordable and stress free but it’s just the opposite. The company has potential but the people up top who make the decisions don’t care about the customers, and why should they, when they’re lining up their pockets with those hidden fees. Shady!</review>

<Text>First off, I want to commend the gym for working to stay open in compliance (not in defiance) of the state’s pandemic protocols. This alone was won me over from my previous gym.  I’m looking forward to seeing what they can offer when regular conditions resume. My only gripe isn’t against the gym but rather some of the members who are indifferent to the pandemic - Your mom doesn’t work at the gym, so clean up after yourselves.</Text>< Pics>

<text>I've been a faithful 24 hour fitness member for as long as I can possibly remember, but I was looking to try out new places in an effort to break away and try something n.

EOS fitness is a fairly new gym that has amazing prices. If you live near their gym, I can see this as being a practical alternative to LA and 24 hour fitness. I went for a 7-day pass and had very little complaints regarding the layout and machines.

During covid, they have a touchless check in. You can either use their keychain ID or your cellphone. You will need a reservation up to 24 hours in advance and the cool part is you can do either 1 or 2 hour reservations.

Cleanliness isn't really all there during this pandemic which is why they get 4 stars from me. There's minimal signage to encourage social distancing so people just assume that every machine is open. News flash: it isn't. But they don't have people monitoring or sanitizing as well so it's a huge free for all and Petri dish.

Still, I'd be willing to give it another shot as I am intrigued by their sauna and other amenities. Overall, I'd consider this to be a great value for those who want to work out and I believe their highest tier is only $25/mo which includes buddy privileges. Always a benefit.

Oh yeah... one thing I wanted to add is that their sales team is terrible. I only got 1 text throughout my 7 day trial asking for assistance on how to get signed up for their membership.< /text>< pics>

I've been trying to cancel since November 2020. the lady I spoke to straight out refused to cancel my subscription and put my account on hold for 3 month. I specifically told her I had been having health issues and knew I wouldn't be going to the gym but whatever I do as I'm told and call March 1st 2021 to cancel and at this point I'm told I need to pay $99 if I want to cancel. Apparently I'm under contract which I was NEVER told when I signed up. This as been the worst and most unprofessional experience EVER. Also when I was trying to go to the gym just to walk on the treadmill it was almost impossible to make an appointment that worked with my schedule. AGAIN WORST EXPERIRNECE EVER! for what its worth the gym is clean and they have good machines</text>

Eos fitness has a nice facility but has horrible customer service and trainers. The trainer cut my first session short because of an error in scheduling on their part and canceled 2 future training sessions multiple times the morning of. I also never received the work out plan I was promised at signup. When I tried to cancel they said it wasn’t in there policy to allow me to cancel. Finally after I asked to see the policy and contract they let me cancel but they made me pay $100 in cancelation fees. I have now spent around $150 on a 30 minute training session and a huge headache. This is the first bad review I have ever written but I feel people thinking about signing up for Eos training should be warned of their poor business ethics.</Text>

It’s a nice gym, but unfortunately because of the pandemic too many people are signed up and every hour is taken for reservations. So you basically pay for a membership for nothing!!! Unless you have enough to wait by your phone for the hour you need. If it’s 30 mins past the time slot you are out of luck!< /Text>

<review>Update: April 7th
My membership got canceled without my authorizing consent. They just went on an canceled it for me. The operation manager at this location in Santa Ana, Samuel was not professional and couldn't solve the problem. All he could say is “sign up again” just to pay an initiation fee AND another annual fee. Literally stealing money from the clients. When i asked for the area managers number he said “we cant give you that information” yet when i reached out to the Murrieta location they gave me their Sales Manger AND the Regional VP number. I have yet to hear back from them.
If they don't call within the next 24 hrs i will be contacting BBB and submit a frauds claim.

Its really hard to reserve a spot at this gym. Good equipment, friendly staff but it can be difficult to acquire a spot for you to come in an workout. You literally have to be stuck on your phone (although, most of you are already stuck on your phones) minutes before (hrs in advance) to reserve a spot. I haven't been able to go for the past 2 months due to that. And my bill is up tomorrow for $70! If you dont pay, your credit gets f*cked up and they dont even offer some type of waiver to help you not go through this. Especially in these trying times. Now im stuck with this gym. No matter where you go people will always try to take advantage. Smh</review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The only thing that is holding me back form giving it 5 stars is the limited amount of reservations you can make due to covid, but other than that it is a great gym. What surprised me when I first switched over from 24  is that it's for half the price and they go up to 140 on dumbbells here< /text>< pics>

This gym is a bit dishonest. I had called in to freeze an account before covid. The guy told me he will do it over the phone and that I don’t need to come in or anything. Well now it’s a couple months out yet I’ve been charged for 3 months and then a $49 fee. What type of business is that? The manager didn’t help. Instead of taking the blame they just brushed it off. No apologies or anything. The staff needs to be properly trained to know how to handle situations. Now I’m going to be contacting an area or regional manager to get some help with this. I dont mind paying if I’m using the facility but this is just shady behavior.
I do not recommend this facility.<//Review>

<Review>Cause of Covid, I haven’t been able to use this gym at all some I started at the beginning of March 2020. I want to give it a fair shot but I cannot at this time. I’ve been charged for three months $60 (not including $50 start up fee) so I’m not happy but I also really wanted to try out the pool and and the yoga classes. That’s what got me to sign up in the first place. Obviously, nobody’s fault, but it’s just cool losing about $100 to a gym membership when you haven’t even had the chance to blow off going to the gym. 🤣 Not a good way to put it, but it’s the choice that matters. Anyways, EOS fitness, gimme a call, e-mail, whatever, let’s sort this out.<//Review><userid>107798725011154566383<//userid><gmap_id>0x80dcd9db6ec04469:0x42c408e6d140a0aa<//gmap_id>< Resp>

I left LA fitness down the street (now renamed ESPORTA). They took over Gold's gym which had an amazing line up of Les Mills classes.
I was so happy when EOS opened and offered LM because LA fitness aka Esporta just doesn't cut it when it comes to serving their members with quality.
The gym is clean and the staff is nice and attentive. Honestly, besides having to wear a mask at the moment to the gym, I couldn't be happier EOS. Well, actually I could be happier if the class times were moved a little closer together with no more than 10 min breaks in between especially in the evenings.< /Review>

I like this gym. Membership prices are good and they offer child care. They have great weights and equipment, pool and jacuzzi, electric sauna and other cool little features. When I signed up they told me they would have a cinema work out room but they haven’t built it yet. Also pool was not up and running when I joined which they said it would be. They did have a few errors with my credit card on file and had given  my paid personal training sessions to someone else that shared my same name. Once they got that sorted out and reimbursed me my money and sessions back I haven’t had any more issues. But staff and the gym where new so attributed that to new staff familiarizing themselves with a new computer system. Their office or front desk staff are friendly but could use a lot more training as far as giving out helpful or correct information. Trainers are great and motivating. Over all good gym fair price.</review>

I don't have many problems with this gym but there are a few one is the loud rap music I don't mind gyms playing music but atleast have some different genres i normally have to turn my music or podcast all the way up to max and I still can hear it the other problems is when I was on a machine that faces the medical building and some girl was standing right in front of me doing squats and it made me kinda uncomfortable because me being a guy if you look up it kinda makes you look like a creeper and it doesn't help with my focus< /Review>

Excellent free weight area, the Yard area (ropes, sled, kettle bells, hex bar, tire lift) is great for nontraditional workouts and everything is kept clean for the most part.  The only thing that killed it for me is the pool.  The pool itself is great.  It's heated and for the most part really clean and sanitary.  I joined this gym specifically because I am a lane swimmer and there aren't a lot of pool options in Santa Ana.  I was told when I first joined that I had to pay 19.99 to use the pool and take classes.  No problem.  One of the associates even told me a  door will be put at the pool entrance to only allow the people that paid more access to the pool.  But I later found out that anybody can use the pool.  I am paying 20 dollars a month for pool use that everyone else is only paying 10 dollars.  Plus, most of the people in the lap pool don't do laps!  One lane should be dedicated to water aerobics and the rest should only be lap use.  So unfortunate that I was misled about this.  I can't recommend this gym unfortunately, even though it is a decent facility.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>A decent gym with lots of equipment. My main gripe is that I wish it wasn’t so crowded. This place gets PACKED in the evenings pre COVID and even during COVID restrictions, it was really busy when I went. Some guests there can be rude but this isn’t really EOS’s fault. At least speaking pre COVID, guests would hardly ever wipe down the machines and I think since it’s a lower fee than other places, it attracts more causal gym goers who don’t know gym etiquette so that’s frustrating but again not really EOS’s fault apart from possibly just having low membership prices.

It’s currently closed but I don’t think I’ll be going back anytime soon unless they limit the amount of people who can come for a session. I think it was like 100 but I feel like there were more than that and they didn’t seem to be checking people’s names on a list when I was there. When I visited during COVID, they had lots of signs to use masks but lots of guests weren’t using masks. I’d like to see stricter enforcement of this policy before I’d come back.

They’re building some more special areas including a spot with hydro beds but that addition took months for them to do. I’ve been a member for about a year and some of the modifications have been in progress all year. I do think that they finished one room though. So I think those additions are eventually coming but they’ll likely be delayed thanks to COVID.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1598290066549, 'text': 'Hi Melody,\n\nThank you for taking the time to leave feedback and we hope you are staying healthy and safe during this time!!

<review>Love the variety of classes, plenty of machines and it has a pool and sauna.  Bathrooms are clean. However the staff needs to be on one page. I ask same the question regarding procedures and get 5 different answers. I believe staff needs more training on policies and procedures. Other thing I don't like is A/C is out quite a bit.

I contacted them on 3/17/20 at about 11:30am, which happened to be the last day they were open before quarantine. I noticed I was being charged more than I was supposed to. A common thing in their reviews. I talked with a manager who attempted to forward me my plan and get off the phone ASAP, but when I was ready quickly with the email and asked where the info was on fees and where the explanation was, she said She didn’t know, they had to close the store soon, didn’t have time to review my plan, and she was going to just cancel it immediately. She kept claiming my plan was to be suspended during quarantine, which it was, But I said that was not what I wanted and what I agreed upon. She said something like “ok I don’t have time for this right now so I’m just going to cancel, I have to be out of work at 4pm” I said ok thanks, thats what I wanted after you’ve mischarged me and the she proceeded to hung up. I also gave her the name of who set up my plan. Now, after quarantine, I’m being charged again and they’ve opened up with a system where I have to reserve my time, meaning it’s not available for the agreed upon time I signed for. They aren’t even providing me what they are falsely charging me for. Don’t do business here. Also, you guys “record calls for quality assurance”, go ahead and run that one back. Listen to the liar you have as a manager.< /text>

<name>Naza Seaman<//name><time>1594135077450<//time><Rating>1</Rating><review>My advice is get a copy of the paper work you sign! Ever since i started with EOS they have always been sneaky. Now that i want to cancel due to the pandemic, They are trying to charge me 49.99 on the 17th because they charge a YEARLY fee? Which was not informed to me when i signed up. (On top of charging me my JULY monthly charge of $22 which they took out today). They charged me $80 dollars the first 2 weeks when i opened my membership when i was told it would take about a month to charge my account  + $22 for the month, even thou i paid their $10 downpayment. The only reason i stayed was because one of the managers begged me not to cancel since they were barely opening and getting alot of complaints and bad reviews, he offered to go pay my 2nd month from his wallet so i decided to proceed with it. Its not about the money, but this is how corporations make their money by lying to their clients! Remember to always Read between the lines...
i waited more than 48 hrs& now that i spoke to mariana she is now saying i will have to wait 3 weeks to even get a response???!! I hope her manager sammie gives me a call as she said they would!</review>< pictures>

Their communication needs a lot of work. Some have no idea whats going on, they will guarantee certain amenities that you actually don't have, and do not inform members of gym closures. The actual gym part is great, but dealing with the staff (excluding the contracted fitness class trainers) is a whole different workout.</Review>< Pictures>

The Gym itself is clean, has an awesome GroupX Manager. No complaints about the facilities.

Just wanted to get the word out about the thieving that goes on here. Someone stole my shoes here. Seriously!!!. Goes to tell you about the clientele that frequent this Gym. I took off my shoes to take a shower. 5 minutes later someone stole my shoes. How low can you go?

Just want people to be aware. Do not take off your shoes or let your out of your sight while at this Gym< /review>

This gym scams people. They lie about pricing and the next time you get charged big time on your account. I tried to cancel but they gave me a hard time. They said I need to go there. One person said it was already cancelled so I just needed to wait for my money. But then after few days they charged my account again. LIARS! They said it was fine and charged me again????
Up to this date, I haven't got my money back. They lied too much. Now they told me I have to see them and fix my account???  Will I get my money back, I asked? they said, just come and we will help you.

Its 24hrs, good variety of workout equipment. Lots of cardio machines downstairs and upstairs. Decent amount of free weights. Small grass area upstairs, swimming pool, sauna. Clean, especially the mens room which I found amazing seeing as most gyms that are 24hrs have nasty ones. Staff has been good with me all the ones I've spoken to.

Can be packed but if you're going to an 24hr gym that's to be expected so find the time that works for you or you'll been waiting for machines sometimes.</Text>

Complete and utter SCAM! DO NOT SIGN UP. I cancelled shortly after registering as a member (within 30 minutes) because the place is dirty, noisy, and overcrowded. Also, most of the promised "amenities" are not available. The location does not have a cardio theater, nor do they have a steamroom. I was assured that my $10 membership fee would be refunded (it wasn't). I was also assured that I would not be charged for the first month. I received a charge for the first month, maintenance fees, and my annual fee. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!< /review>

UPDATE:

I had a bad experience at first and it was handled with a reasonable time. It’s not a bad gym and the staff aren’t bad either. There was just a misunderstanding and it got fixed. NOW, the thing that stands out about this gym is the staff, getting a follow up by a team member named bree on the situation that happened and if it was resolved shows the commitment they have with their customers! I recommend 10/10 to sign up for this gym if you’re trying to get taken care of by great staff and great atmosphere 💪🏽<//review>

I want to change gyms. It's not necessarily the gym's fault as most of the people who come here don't re-rack their weights and equipment so I can't ever find anything or complete my workouts. A squat platform was entirely non usable as someone took the bar from it and I had to cut my workout short multiple times due to large groups taking over the cable machines all the time. It's a nice looking gym that unfortunately attracts the inconsiderate crowd.
Its conveniently located just off the 55 freeway but I find it to have one of the hardest locations to get out of especially during rush hour. And the parking garage can be difficult.
The good points of this gym would include clean lockers and a nice area for cardio. They have a wide range of equipment which is good while I train with someone in a different gym and need equipment not commonly seen in other gyms. But unfortunately I think I'm going to find a different place. Price is great, but not if I can't get my workouts completed.<//Text>

Newer remodeled gym who took over the old LA fitness. It gets crowded during rush hours 5pm til 9pm ish. Membership is nice for the price. Bring your own towel, towels come at an extra fee. Theres no pushy trainers forcing you to sign up, friendly staff and clean equipments. I wonder what are their plans for the old court. Its still closed off to the public.</Review>

UPDATE: The cleanliness of the locker area as well as the locker interior are greatly improved. Thanks for listening. EOS rocks... deserve a 5 STARS rating...
Nice facility. Just join membership here. Lot of new equipment. Men lockers are new but some are not clean. Some people made a mess inside but no cleaning is done on off hours. I come back next day, the mess is still there.</Text>

First off, they gave me a 30 day money back guarantee if I didn't like the place. The gym opened May 1st but the pool (the only thing we use) wasn't open for several more weeks.

Then the place was filthy. There was still construction dust over a month old in the locker rooms. Like no one had cleaned it in a month. The showers had mud (at least I hope it was mud) all over the showers. The pool is so dirty you can't see the bottom. It's also packed with people not swimming. Just playing around, like it's a public pool.

After complaining several times about how filthy, dirty and unsanitary the conditions were, nothing changed.

I tried to cancel my membership and they gave me a hassle. Then said it was cancelled. Then they charged my card again at the beginning of the month.

The Better Business Bureau is getting a call on this place.

Avoid this gym like the plague.<//Text><response>{'time': 1562618409024, 'text': 'Hello Drew,\nThank you for taking the time to leave us some feedback.

Overall great gym, only real complaint is they really blast the music loudly! Either it's louder than my headphones or in having to yell over it to talk to anyone...but great other than that.<//review>

Finally joined a gym worth the money, every exercise machine is brand new. Clean restrooms, bathrooms are decent, the sauna is also brand new swimming pool is new or remodeled and Olympic size and Jacuzzi is also new or remodeled. Free Cycling classes,free Zumba classes free dance classes in the swimming pool, and in the studio,free yoga classes. Access to personal trainers, free weights upstairs, elevator and more. I love it so far.
$9.99 a month plus a one time.  $99 to join for the first year next year I'll pay $49 . I use cardio machines and go easy since I just started on July, this kind of activity helps me dealing with depression and anxiety at least while I'm there, specially in the swimming pool.< /Text>

<Review>Poor customer service. The location is difficult to get to and the fact that you have to park in a structure and validate is really inconvenient. Spoke with the manager Isiah and he is clueless about how to be a manager and couldn’t help with the simplest thing. I would avoid this gym at all cost. I had called in and cancelled my membership 2 days ago and then called to check and make sure it was done because the girl on the phone sounded a bit clueless. Of course it wasn’t cancelled and the statement she made that I wouldn’t be charged the next month was also a lie too.<//Review>< Pics>

Another positive part of the parking structure is that we never run out of parking and you never have to walk too far to get to the gym!

I started last monday with my friend im his guest, ive been to several gyms now, golds gym, 24 hr fitness, planet fitness and this one in particular it was in a sketchy place to me since i would walk around there before and it was a bad street buts its actually not when you turned into the lights, its super clean, really well established good equipment, customsr service i do find it a little bit judgy but maybe im misreading their faces and stuff, its basically a cheaper option from LA fitness same set up just cheaper and still good, id recommend it more for someone whos barely starying for example gold gym is for those wanna be arnold Schwarzenegger.... But this is good for someone who thinks he/she will gdt judge which you wont since everyone there seems to be starting</text>

Organized, professional, compassionate, kind, need-based help for people. Julio and Jonathan did a wonderful job on the work my home qualified for, they were professional and knowledgeable, as well as the supervisor whose name I don't have. The office staff including Felicia and Maria (who works out in the field) are extremely professional and friendly. Highly recommend for low income home owners and renters for safety and energy efficiency repairs. If you need help with a big repair and are getting ridiculous estimates from contrators, it doesn't hurt to ask, they may be able to help you with it.</Review>

<review>Hard to find. Plus you have to park on the street or you'll get towed. No bathrooms and water. Other than that they do provide great assistance to families in need of electric bill help. Takes about 2 hours to get out of there. Make sure you have all documents  use bathroom beforehand  and  bring a drink or snack.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

<Text>I am so grateful for Campecinos Unidos taking care of all the weatherstriping around the doors, sealing holes under sinks, replacing the range hood, showerheads, nightlights, energy efficient LED bulbs, and gave me 2 new energy efficient floor lamps for my dark living room! They did this all for FREE!!! The workers, Julio and Rubin were both respectful, courteous and polite.They worked quickly and were very thorough, efficient and professional! They even cleaned up their mess before they left! I was very impressed with Rubin and Julio and the great job they did!
I feel blessed and very grateful for their hard work and for everything that was provided at no cost! This is a MIRACLE! God is taking care of me and I feel that my husband, Allen who passed away 5 days ago is watching over me.Thank you from the bottom of my heart! God bless Campesinos Unidos, and Julio and Rubin!

<Review>Great people doing a great thing for others in need.
They are very efficient, but very particular that you provide what they ask for.  I Costco myself an hour because I did provide what they asked in the form they asked for it.< /Review>< rating>

This place is beautiful and so are the people. They offer aid to needy people who are struggling to pay their utility bill, as well as assist in optimizing their homes to reduce utility costs. They will also help with broken hot water heaters, stoves, and refrigerators. They are a great resource and the work they're doing is touching. The people here love their job and helping others, that's plain to see in the work they do.< /Text>

Love this place they helped me with my electric bill and gas bill. My bill was 800 dollars they paid it all. I just had shoulder surgery and husband had to take time off to help me and his job laid him off after that so this place really helped us out. The electric company wanted their money of course they helped pay just in time</Review>

<review>Found  out of this place after calling 211, I called on a Wednesday at 11am spoke to a representative she placed me on hold immediately after answering the call she asked for my perosonal information several times she went ahead and told me that she could put in for tomorrow at 10am she told me all the things I had to bring but I did not take her name! BIG MISTAKE! After arriving to my appointment I checked in and was asked to sit down and wait they called me to the window after 20 Min of waiting just to tell me I was not in there system they asked me who I called to set up this appointment I showed them my phone and the 8 minute call history on my phone they said that didn’t matter and that I would have to wait for next Monday to call and set up a new appointment! I asked if there was anything they could do for me I was there with everything they asked and my shutoff notice is for Monday they said no and to call Monday. I did not take no for an answer and asked to speak to there manager. There manager “Marlene” came to the window and I repeated to her my story again showed her my phone with the call history  she said that did not matter and to call Monday. I asked her someone here took down all my information and how would I know what to bring she replied by our website! I was blown away by her response she pretty much said I lied and not once did she even apologize or empathize. I get it we are there to ask for assistance but don’t expect to be treated with respect or any dignity at this place. A simple apology would have gone a long way I had lost hours of work so that I could be here on time with all paperwork for this appointment. The whole time this manager was speaking to me she was smerking as if this was funny to her. I told her the fact that you are standing there with that look just shows me what kind of human being you are. This is not funny and people come here for help Not for this type of treatment. I also asked for her managers contact information and she said it was a TONY but the number she gave me was wrong! CAMPESINOS UNIDOS I am sure this is a wonderful organization and the intention is to help but please be aware of the staff you have in place. Are they really there for the cause or for a check ? Marlene, is definitely not!</review>< pics>

<Text>They came to my door asking if my family and I needed help with our utilities. We gave vital personal information to them to see if we qualified for services. 6 months went by and they sent out someone to check our windows. The technician talked more about what he wouldn't do than what he could do. 6 months later we gave updates info, meanwhile our next door neighbor got everything fixed in their unit. More excuses and still no repairs, or windows that were promised. The inspection of our attic supposedly had some old building material they believed to contain asbestos. Meanwhile our neighbor received no attic inspection. This company seems motivated to help Spanish speaking households.</Text>< pictures>

This process is an incredible pain but if you can get through it you will get relief from this bill hanging over your head. The people that work there are really nice and helpful.  Just to get an appointment I had to wait on the phone all day both days they were available.  Once you get your appointment, which is pretty quick, have your paperwork together and it's pretty fast.  They paid my entire past due bill and I'm so grateful for that<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Resp>None< /Resp><review>I can't honestly say enough positive things about this organization. They've literally saved my life, not joking. My power was shut off for 9, NINE DAYS, I lost what little food I had left in my fridge and freezer, was contemplating suicide as drowning in bills was a much slower death it seemed, and I thought I had run out of options, and hope. But these people helped me in the most hugest ways, and not just by paying my past due bills to get my power back on, they sent people out to my home and are replacing my old inefficient appliances with new ones, repairing my broken windows, stealing doors, insulating my attic, all things needed to be done that I just couldn't have been able to afford to fix on my own and we're just contributing to my sinking situation. I have no idea who these Angels are, but I'm so grateful they were sent to me! Side note, if you know someone struggling to pay their electric bills, or needing help In any way here in San Diego, call 211, any time 24/7, and they can help you to get the assistance you need. To CUI, thank you so much!</review></record></dataset><record>

Always awesome service , just have your paperwork and necessary items ready and be on time , no exceptions,  and they will get you in and out fast. If you don't have all your items , documents etc , u should just reschedule  until you do. You won't be happy and it won't work well . I'm always readywhen I go . It's hard sometimes to get the appt on the busy phones. Just keep trying and you will get in eventually . It's so worth it .<//review>

This is a place that can help you one time and that is it just one time. So make sure you have a few months and they will pay it for you only one time. So pick wisely when you go and be ready to spent more than four hours there.</review>< pictures>

I made an appt for the next day and the whole process only took 45 minutes. They truly are an amazing recourse for those in need.

The driver of this campesinos van turned into the wrong lane and almost hit me.  After that he made a right turn onto the freeway from a straight lane.  This all happened on Aero during evening traffic.  There are already 2 turn lanes and he used the third lane to skip more traffic.

I don’t need any help from this organization.  I just need you to stop driving stupid.  You almost hit a $63,000 truck, and I’m sure that’s not good for business/charity.< /review></record>

Call 211 for assistance and orientation times and dates. Quit wasting time trying to reach them on the phone. If you really need help, you go in person, take all the stuff they request and you get taken care of, its very easy.</Text>

<Text>Tacos here are amazing and well worth waiting in the queue for. Tried the fish tacos as well as meat tacos (pork). This place is busy but pretty organized. Loved the free Salsa bar with many choices of Salsa. Also tried the lemon and lime Fresca drink.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2c611920ca5c5:0x8795401ec19a475f<//Gmap_id><user>103413767018107865726</user><rating>4< /rating><Resp>None< /Resp>< date>

The ambience was really nice and intimate. Went with a bunch of my girlfriends. They had a great wine selection and it is tapas style of food. We ordered a bunch of dishes that we all shared. The portion size was enough and flavor was perfect. Out of all the dishes, I really enjoyed the Vegan Carrot Taquitos and the Baked Brie!<//review>< gmapID>

Great tacos and great service! I got the 3 taco and soda combo for $7.99. The carne asada is flavorful and lean. No gross bites! I'm picky about texture so good meat is a big deal! The girl at the counter and the cook were both super friendly and the food is delicious!< /review>

(Translated by Google) I do not like how they cater and I think that the manager is very offered with the clients. Well, if you are a woman, it does not serve you in the same way as if you are a man. I do not like the food very much, only its micheladas.

<text>I wish I would have started coming here sooner! I bought my tires in the fall and after getting a flat I called and they got me right in, found the issue and fixed it at no charge. Edgar was very thorough in explaining what they did and the customer service was great from check in to getting my keys back.< /text></record></dataset><record>

It's a great place with even better customer service.  Sometimes they may be busy, but like all things in life, good things come to those who wait.... or at least that's what people say. For the service, prices, and customer service I rather wait and be treated well than go to another place. Thank you Luis and Neil.< /Text>

<text>Had a fantastic experience with Kyle today over at the shop. Had wheel locks that I didn’t have the key for, they took them off and swapped them for another set for a ridiculously cheap price.

<Review>I had a tire shop for many many years, located on main street. They were awesome with service and pricing. Why did I change? They expanded and and although the expansion was good for them they had to make up for the money invested so prices went up and customer service wasn't that personal anymore. I am huge on customer service so, yes, I will look for a new anything if the customer service is not up to par. Luckily I found Courtneys Tires on Broadway. They are by far the best tire shop I have been to(and I have been to many)in San Diego. Their prices are very competitive, add to that their amazing customer service and you hit the jackpot. Edgar is very attentive and goes the extra mile to make sure you receive outstanding service. From a flat to needing to replace your tires their service is superb. Dan, the owner, is also very friendly and accommodating. Everyone here will do their best to make your time at their tire shop a good one. I highly recommend this establishment...5 stars⭐ in my book</Review>< pictures>

Owned and operated by a local Chula Vista family for decades. With soo many tire places on broadway, it’s nice to see this place busy, it’s well deserved. Some of the nicest, most helpful people. Whether you bought the tires from them or not they offer free repairs and pressure checks. I’ve been going to them for years and it’s always a pleasure. Thanks Dan and crew. You guys are top notch.<//text>

My truck breaks was pretty bad, metal on metal sounded pretty bad. I came in today with no appointment these guy's are about to close up shop for the day , they was very kind and helped me out and got new brakes and rotors. I really appreciate the time they took right before closing time to get my truck on the road again and safe driving knowing i got quality work done with fair pricing.. I would definitely recommend my friends and family along with who ever wants great quality work and service. Thank you Courtney tires< /Review>

Courtney's repaired it quick as well as at an extremely reduced rate. They put all new tires on my auto with the very same quick, polite service at a terrific reduced rate. If you DO have it, I didn't see a sign as well as nobody told me, so you might post an indication right under the TV.< /Review>

<Review>What an unexpected surprise and experience!!! Courtney Tire Service has a customer for life now and we will shout their praises for others to hear.  We unexpectedly had a screw in our trucks back tire, and we went to two separate discount tire locations who couldn't help without a 2-4 hour window - we were unable to sit that long and were heading home after getting some air -- decided we'd head home and figure something out along the way - we came across Courtney's stopped and I went in to ask if they could help while my husband remained in the truck - they were so nice and said absolutely! I asked how long do you think, they smiled said we will do it right now (there were other vehicles there being worked on) - I smiled and said thank you so much you are a Godsend - the gentlemen walked out - my husband pulled in and we sat in the lobby looking around - not even 15 minutes went by and they were back inside and said here's your keys -  you go and have a great day!  We offered to pay and they continuously refused and continued to thank us for stopping by and wished us a happy holiday season (this was shortly after Thanksgiving) -- all the workers were so friendly and a nice lady told us the history of their store behind the desk.  It made such a huge impression on us - and we def will be back when we need service. Thank you Courtney Tires -- wish everyone could know about you - we will never visit any other tire place again!!!!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>Dan the owner is a very personal man. I'm a salesman myself , and if I had a innovative product that I was taking to market , and I would only be able to hire one person , it would be Dan. That says a lot considering I only met the gentleman today.

Dan makes this saying a TRUE STATEMENT :

YOU DON'T GET A SECOND CHANCE TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION.

Thanks Dan for the men you hired.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

They are always quick and friendly, no matter how busy they are. They ordered me much more expensive tires on accident once and threw them on at the same price without hesitation.  I've gotten quotes from discount a few times, and Courtney's always gives me a quote for the same price but much better tires.

<text>Listen here. No seriously, do yourself a favor and pay attention.
There are 2 things that Dan and his team will save you when you bring your car or truck to Courtney Tire Services. Time and money.
Hands down the easiest, smoothest, and most positive experience around. I came here on a recommendation, and now I see why.

Prices were the same as the internet guys, and I was back on the road in 90 minutes. Remember when I said time and money. TicToc. Cha-Ching!

That folks, is why I will always be a customer of CTS.
Give them a call, make your appointment, and get ready to actually enjoy getting tires, shocks, and an alignment.
Everyone on staff that I spoke with was positive and professional.
Thanks again Dan.

<Text>Last year, I purchased a used car. It's a salvage title and from what the seller told me, I understood that it needed some work. However, I was not prepared to find out that one of the control arms, the subframe, and the frame were all bent. A friend recommended Courtney Tire to me and I am so glad I chose to go there. Dan was very helpful and would answer all of the questions I asked him whenever I called. The frame had to be fixed elsewhere, but the work on the subframe and control arm, as well as the alignment on my car, was excellent. I can now drive my car in confidence. I highly recommend this business. Thank you to everyone who works at Courtney Tire!<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><gmap_id>0x80d94ddc6d15434b:0xc43af005ea159b2e<//gmap_id><Time>1547578208886< /Time>< user_id>

I have a difficult time keeping reviews brief, but I'll try to make this an exception. I've received nothing but helpful happy service for the fifteen years I've been a driver; this has been my ONLY tire shop. My dad has been a customer since he was in college (when was college invented?). Everyone I've sent here felt similarly and even ended up with better prices versus big tire chain stores on the same tires. A local pay-to-play exotic car experience company has their wheel and brake services done here. One of the co-founders and the namesake co-founder's son run this shop, and the grandson recently joined the ranks. I would challenge you to find a better or friendlier shop, but it's unlikely you could sway me from my position.</text>

<Text>My tire was giving me a real head ache due to a nail puncture trying to figure out where to go to get it fixed. I called triple a to get some air to drive it down to a service stop and they couldn't take me in that day. Then drove to Courtney's just in time to have it fixed. I would give more stars if I could, quick and awesome customer service. I was out of there before I could start any work my computer in the waiting area.</Text><resp>None</resp><time>1461092185804< /time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Told my wife to take our 2017 4runner trdp here for alignment and balance as it got bigger tires and it had a lil shake at 65 to 70. Now it shakes at 40 to 65 and 80to 85. Told my wife to take it back to get fixed so she did. They told her its the axel the wheels are to big bs. So they didn't even check it or try to fix.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Every time we get a tire issue near Fontana area, we go straight to these guys. Not only are they affordable but the entire team is on it. Kid you not 7-10 tire technicians ready to assist. We Purchased 8 used re-caps for $800 with about 85% life with dismount/mount (couldn’t find a matching deal or better). Tony/Victor & Sam were the ones that attended me through out the process. They also impressed me when they not only torqued the wheels with the air gun but also with a manual spec torque bar for accuracy and safety.<//Text>< pics>

Found them on best tires in my area as I really need it too tires for my Acura RL. And I left with two nearly brand new Michelin tires for a extremely low price installed. I highly recommend this place as the guys that work there are very friendly and welcoming as well<//review>

<text>If your looking to get the best low price on tires, this is the place. I walked in and right away I was greeted by some of the most kindness people I have ever met, they were very knowledgeable of the type of tires I was looking for. They didn’t even charge me for the dismount and mounting of the old and new tires. Plus warranty on the new tires can’t beat that type of excellent customer service.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c34cc079870ccf:0x918aabaa92c0a25b< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ordered a pair of 315 kumhos over the phone and spoke directly with Tony he said he would leave them for $950 out the door including taxes, so how come when I show up they want to charge me over a thousand dollars when the price was already negotiated, and on top of that they didn't have the tires there, I'd rather go to Commercial Tires Inc, in Fontana just got off the phone with them and they're less than 900 including tax FOR THE SAME TIRES< /Review>

<username>Ernest M<//username><review>This guys are fast and reasonable priced. If your local or over the road driver/owner operator come by this place first before you get ripped off somewhere else. They have a 24hr road side service that covers southern California.  If they can't help will help you get in contact with someone in your area if they can't help you.< /review>< user>

These guys replace truck tires like a NASCAR pit crew.  I've never seen tires changed so fast in my 13 years out here.  Plus they have really good prices.  They replaced my 8 trailer tires in no more than 30 minutes. 😁< /Text>

Don't trust Tony's,They give you a price on tires and afterwards Tony changes the price to another price with extra charges and give you another brand tire. Make sure you get your paid  Receipt first because they will lie about your final price. The federal business bureau  need to check into this company for changing prices on customers.< /Text>

<Text>My son moved to the area for his 1st post-college job, and after a couple weeks of research Cherrywood wound up at the top of our list.  We visited the top 5 apartment complexes today, starting and ending here.  The combination of price, manicured property, well-maintained unit, pools, gyms, nearby shopping, access to road arteries was unmatched by any competitors.

Leonard Armenta gave us the tour this morning, then walked us through all the hoops of getting the apartment (including setting up the apartment account, credit check, rental insurance, utilities, making electronic deposit and 1st month rent) leased this afternoon.

This guy is great at his job!< /Text><Rate>5</Rate>< pics>

We’ve been living there for 4 years and absolutely loved it. The stuff is nice and responsive, the maintenance team is great (was always taking care on the same or the next day). They’re really taking good care about the outdoor area, plants and lawn. There’s a security patrol on every night.
Also they were hosting many events with the gifts and snacks. Very friendly place.
The location is really convenient for everything you need.</Text>

The new staff is lacking of People skill. I used to deal with the old leasing agent and he is now no longer working there. The new assistant manager is not very helpful, friendly, and flexible. I was signing a lease renew with new rent and quite expensive, and I was request for a wall paint and carpet cleaning. But they only give me one option to choose.  Last year when I signed my lease renew, the previous leasing agent Leonard, he was super fair and offered me both options. He was very helpful and fair. And I wish he is still working there.

Especially if they would rent out this unit to someone else, they would have to clean the carpet anyway. So I don’t understand why they only offer me one option to choose. When the wall paint should automatically come with the new lease signing.< /text>

Worst place for renting, the office members are disaster personally and never listen to us. The rent rate was really high with low quality service. Around 10 pm came and wanted to park someone parceled at my spot and ask the office to remove the car but they said you have to park other place we car not able to find the car owner to replace the car.
Fair enough!<//Text>

{'time': 1591123510099, 'text': 'Dear Faezeh H., Your review is puzzling since we do not have a record of your name on a lease as a resident nor of the incident you mention. At 10 PM, you would have dealt with the courtesy patrol and not the office. In general, we do call for towing if another car is parked in a resident’s reserved space and the owner of the improperly parked car can’t be reached to move it.  Should you wish to discuss this situation, please contact us at info@cherrywoodapartments.com to start the conversation; we’d be happy to hear from you.'}<//response>

The units are really spacious and expensive but you definitely get what you pay for. The managers give you ample notice before they fix or turn off anything and they dump a ton of money into landscaping so it always looks great outside. There are car break ins every now and then but never any apartment break ins.

The gym is oddly crowded from 6:30-7:00 with young adult youth most days of the week.< /Text>

<Review>We lived in Cherrywood Apartments for several years. The rules were excessive: no pets, part only in assigned spaces, no noise, no guest unescorted, etc. It got to be too much, so we bought our own place and then moved. When  we moved out, the inspection conformed to the excessive rules.<//Review>< pics>

you can't park backwards and that frustrated me. i didn't much like the pool because i never did used it. the gym is a big plus, but there are too many people there at 630 in the morning. also the lounge is v bad -- no air conditioning and small. but i didn't have any single problem with the staff. lots of hummingbirds. i like them so i gave this place an extra star.</Review>

Known for its inconsistency in enforcing apartment complex rules. It seems the landlord's personal beliefs get in the way of fair enforcement. Definitely would not recommend until the landlord stops their blatant discrimination.</text>

< Review>
THE WORSE PLACE EVER, DO NOT RENT HERE! The property manager Terry is an ass. He thinks he knows it all even if you're asking a question. He cuts you off and answers what he thinks you're going to ask. The property management there SUCK. They're not consistent w/what they say, they are rude and have no people skills. The staff lacks experience and people skills. The apartments are old and even though they upgrade the apartments they make sure it's with very cheap merchandise and cheap labor. The parking is very limited and if you park out side of apartment building get ready to share the street with a homeless crack head or people that come by just to smoke out, drink, have sex,  break into your cars as well as write on your cars and cut the tires of your car. If you have a problem with a rude tenant don't expect the management or the security to do anything. They ask you not to call them. WATCH OUT... make sure you don't leave anything on your patio because after hours the assistant manager drives around the parking lot looking for something to write you up about. BUT WAIT... it gets better! Get ready to have your living space that you pay a ton of money for have more inspections than ever before and  with less than a 24 hour notice. Funny, they expect the tenants to follow the rules but they don't follow it themselves. Great way to set an example. There has been incidents where the tenants have had to call PG&E because of a gas leak that property management doesn't do anything about. Save your selves from the head ache and don't rent here. They will also take your security deposit and say they fix something when in reality they just paint over the problem and pocket the rest of the money.</Review>

Not a single friend has been invited to this nightmare. The walls are paper thin so if you live on the bottom you better be able to tolerate child beaters.

I've been a customer of this store for almost 20 years and even tho I no longer even live in this neighborhood, it is by far and hands-down my favorite convenience store/ gas station. Family owned and run, lots of parking, and CLEAN & SAFE here in STOCKTON even at night? Makes it priceless, in my book.<//Review>

Best gas station in Stockton. Period. Mom and pop type place. Family owned and operated. The kind of place you won't go into for 5 years, and the day you return, they smile, and greet you by your first name.
Well stocked shelves. A large variety of products to suit any craving you might have. But they also carry some healthy food options, which is rare for a gas station in Stockton.
I love this place. It's my preferred gas station to spend my money at.
I recommend it to EVERYONE!!!</text>

Anything you might need from a toothbrush, first aid kit, salt, laundry detergent, or car oil. All the way too earrings, posters, hats, or if you just need a nice cold drink after work. Then this liquor store would be ideal for you.<//review>

<Review>Waterloo Liquors has been around since I was a kid. This place is pretty cheap in terms of pricing, gas isnt too cheap, but it's okay. The only downside is the people that hang out around it.< /Review><rate>4</rate></record>

Always very friendly. Family run and well stocked. Lots of 25 cent candies to choose from and a tasty soda fountain.<//Review>

When I need to get my steps in for the day.. this is where I walk to. The variety selection of beverages, smokes, gasoline and nick nack needs all in a 1 stop shop. Very friendly staff, polite and always greets you with a smile. Have had a personal conversation with the manager on duty and it was really nice to hear his story. Highly recommend.< /text>

This is a good sized convenient/liquor/gas station that is just west of hwy 99.  I have yet to see it not busy, and you can get just about anything there, most of the staff are nice and helpful, when they're not is because they are really busy.< /text>

I've been stopping by there since I was a teenager.  Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY FROZEN FOOD FROM THERE!! Despite the fact that they charged me $9 for tyson chicken the chicken was outdated by several months. So I took the liberty to check the other FROZEN food items and most of them were outdated. They charge $1.75 for cheap coffee that doesn't taste good. It tastes very very cheap. The staff at night charge you extra for things. I really feel very sickened that they take advantage of the low income families there with all of their outrageous price hawks!! Shame shame shame.< /text>

<Review>This is a uncommon jewel of Stockton. Waterloo liquors has an amazing verity of good and services. From Bootleg DVD's to single cigarettes! Canned goods and booze! The slurpies are great. The fountain drinks are top notch! The service is acceptable and the patrons are human. But let's get to the best part. Waterloo liquors has top tier gasoline. That's a rare gem to be found at non-franchise gas stations. I can't say enough about top tier petrol! Best kind for internal combustion engines. Get your gas there is your in the area!

<review>(Translated by Google) It's a stop on the way to Yosemite.
It's located in Stockton.
It seems to be the cheapest of the gas stations nearby.
Located about an hour away from San Francisco.
There was no toilet.
You can buy drinks and stuff like the store name.

(Original)
요세미티 가는 길에 들른 곳입니다.
스탁튼에 위치하고 있구요.
근처 주유소중에 제일 저렴한거로 보입니다.
샌프란시스코에서 약 한시간 남짓 거리에 위치합니다.
화장실은 따로 없었습니다.
상점 이름과 같이 음료와 먹거리는 구매할 수 있습니다.</review>< GmapID>

<review>I applaud the folks at Fugazzis. The menu is varied and the food is tasty. I feel I could come back here many times, in fact my review is based on to dinners in a row. Spicy shrimp Pasta arrabbiata was filling and tasty. The second night I had the very good New Spinach Salad with shrimp and the fish tacos. The tacos come in beef, chicken and Fish, but you must order three of the same.
I enjoyed the meals and would come back again.</review><time>1566439518983<//time><rate>4< /rate><user_name>Chandler Briggs</user_name><userid>104229158430598998890< /userid><response>None< /response>< Pictures>

<text>We ordered a Chicken Family Meal. Very yummy! F.Y.I., the chicken is covered with a green cilantro sauce type gravy. Too salty for my liking. But my husband loved it. Customer service was wonderful. We had asked for the cilantro sauce ON THE SIDE (separate container.) But when we arrived to pick it up, the cashier informed us that mistakenly the chicken was prepared with the sauce. To compensate their error, they quickly cooked us a serving of plain chicken. In addition, they added free of charge some bread and a coupon for a free meal. Thank you Fugazzis. Your service is great and the taste of your food is delicioso!</text>< pics>

Oh my goodness!!!! This Veggie pizza was soooo amazing! My fiancé and I had lost confidence in regular pizza. There are many options but we had yet to find one that blew our mind until now. This veggie pizza is THE BEST PIZZA WE HAVE EVER HAD!!!! Ty fugazzis!!!!! We also got the California bistro and chicken sandwich. Both also delicious as well 😊< /review>

Ordered a jalepeno popper beef salad and tequila lime fettuccine.  I get the salad without the popper and asked if it came with it and the girl said I ordered it without it but she would fix it. The cook then said "I thought you said she didn't want the popper?" and she said (in Spanish) that she said she didn't but now she does. So I answered in Spanish that she must have heard me wrong because I ordered it just like it comes on the menu. She said it was ok and she was sorry and then rolled her eyes. Beef tastes like fish and pasta sauce was extra watery.< /Text>

Food typically is very fresh and tastes great but the cooking lately has been spotty, forgetting things on the salad for instance, serving meat medium rare when well done was asked for. The last 3 visits the food was not prepared as ordered or things omitted from the dish that was clearly on the menu</review>

Frys great, salad fresh and yummy, both our sandwiches were lifeless, lacking any flavor or the usual Fugazzi pizzazz.  Philly cheesesteak, and Turkey avocado. 12 bucks for a sandwich, you expect flavor.<//Text>

Great food, pizza, pasta, sandwiches, & salads!!! Group of us taking a work break stop by and ordered a bit of everything, all smiles! I’ve enjoyed their pizzas in the past but wife’s first time and she liked along with their chicken lime pasta was fabulous. The wife is a pasta person but I am choosing to say fabulous flavor and a must try. Thanks staff for a memorable dinner experience truly.</Text>

The food was great, but the service was terrible. From the over exaggerated sigh as the girl had to swipe my gift card below the register, to the blatant glare as I went back to the register to place a to- go order,  and finally the loud conversation about her personal life (unprofessional language included). My children and I won’t be returning.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>One of the BEST bbq chicken pizzas i've ever had.  It was hot, fresh, and downright delicious!!!  I gotta say that i'm a tough person to please when it comes pizza.  The proportion of toppings to sauce was on point!!  The pizza was piping hot and the service was friendly and attentive.  I don't think I  will ever go back to the main street location again which happens to be closer to my house.   The extra 5 minutes drive is worth the superior food and customer service.   Keep up the good work Fugazis on Akers!!!< /text>< Pics>

What an amazing find!!!  We stopped in for breakfast just to kill time between appointments and wow are we glad we did.  We ordered their omelete and their bacon egg potatoe breakfast.  Wilbur ( my husband musician Greg) said the omelete was the absolute best he had ever had, beats even the omelete he covets in Pismo!!  I had the eggs bacon and potatoes.  Eggs were a perfect over medium, bacon crisp and delicious and the poatoes, oh my gosh!!  Sweet potatoes, red potatoes and a wonderful purple potatoe I have never experienced before.  All cut country style and lightly seasoned so you can enjoy the true flavor.  Service was amazing, coffee excelent and the price is well below what we should have paid for such an excellent meal and experience.  Even more surprising they have take out plus you can get delivery through Grub Hub and Door Dash.  Thank you Faguzzi's!  We will be back!!< /Text>

Decent, made to order food at the lower cost version of the pricier downtown location. Convenient to the Holiday Inn Express and also is a one-stop shop. You can also get your car washed, get gas, and buy beer and cigarettes when you are done eating! 👌<//text>

Good food, their salads are delicious and large. Their manager was very service minded. The space is a bit canteen kinda and plates are disposable plastic ones.< /text>

<review>Went today with my husband for a lunch treat and was so disappointed. After getting seated and our drinks we ordered an appetizer which was quite tasty and had me looking forward to my meal but nope.  Our meals came and we each took a bite and my husband's said "wait, I ordered the blackened shrimp not chicken." I looked around for our server but but I guess he was busy with us being his only table at that time. He finally came out from the back and we let him know about the mix-up and he corrected us! I informed him that the shrimp was ordered first and I had the chicken and again he corrected me. My husband told him there was no mix-up and if he had written our order down he could reference it right now. The server took his meal and went to the back and we heard "I know" and he came back out and my husband ordered 2 shots of 1800 about 10 min goes by and the server tells us they are out of 1800 but have Hornitos so my husband said ok 2 shots of that.  The meal comes back and another beer is ordered and we ask about our shots and the server goes "you didn't order and shots, you said no since we didn't have 1890"  "NO! we ordered the shots when you informed us about the 1800" surprise! Our shots show up but the server no longer was pleasant and actually surly. During this time 2 other tables filled but 1 table left before their drinks were finished and the server actually delivered the last table their food but dropped some of their food in the floor and didn't replace it. What was suppose to be a nice treat from my husband turned out to be the meal from hell.< /review><user_name>Patricia Lewis</user_name>< Pictures>

My mom and sister went to see me aunt in visalia and I couldnt go because of work and loveee getting fugazzis. I asked my mom to pick some up for me when they left to come back home. When they went in today, they were told that they only had breakfast. But they employees went out of their way to make a batch of the bread and their red sauce for me. I wanna say thank you for doing this! Awesome place!<//review></record>

Tasty and fast.  Very similar menu to Fugazzi's on main but in a faster more casual format.<//text>

The employees were eating behind the counter/ in the kitchen area. My order wasn't ready in 20 as they quoted it was ready in 40. Lastly the food was decent and hot but not worth the money.</review>

Waited 3 hours just to be told that I could not be helped. Once I provided the reason of my visit, the staff should have been able to determine whether or not they could provide assistance. Instead they told me to wait outside in my car for 3 hours. Terrible experience.< /Text>

Even with an appointment and early arrival (20 minutes)you still end up waiting at least 45 minutes yet you show up 15 min late and your appointment is cancelled. Don't understand the math behind that equation nor the rank in who's time is more important?! Restroom always dirty. Staff in the back is friendly but some of the front staff need some front staff basic people skills like a smile or a upbeat tone of voice as you are dealing with the people not machines.< /review>

Quick walk-in for a drug test. Clean and everything was easy and fast. When asked for a estimated wait time they were accurate and even allowed me to wait in my car till it was time to go in. Very  appreciated<//Review>

The medical stuff are amazing however it’s not the case of Robert Hennessy M.D.
No patient should be released while still in pain. I was even shocked by his report :
RELEASED PER PATIENT REQUEST.
What a NEGLIGENCE!</review>

Misdiagnosed my shoulder injury, causing poor care. Location misdiagnosed husbands torn rotator cuff as "muscle strain". Even after MRI showed it was torn, they told him it wasn't and their treatment caused permanent damage, ending his career, and leaving him in chronic pain. The only positive thing is that they do DOT physicals, and their system to do this is excellent.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dcd783bf9da653:0x682464014dc6f774< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

They took way too long. Tell me why I had an appointment at 10AM and there were not able to see me until 12:30PM. That’s a 2 1/2 hour wait! On top of that they forgot to administer two test and I had to come back because they forgot. They just need to operate faster. I got there at 10AM and didn’t leave until 5PM. That’s way too long of a visit. This place needs to be more organized and not make people wait so long. Will not be returning to this location. Mostly all Concentras are bad though.</text>

The staff were not welcoming. The hours of operation for their services need to change to help assist the people better. I had to go to this place 3 times (instead of the normal 2) because of the services requested by my employer (just a drug screen, TB test, and regular physical). I was told I can only get the physical and TB in the mornings between 7 AM - 5 PM. So I took the the drug test on a Thursday. I went back on Friday for the rest ;for them to tell me that I have to come back Monday to have my TB read due to them not being open on Sundays. So I’m the first one in line Monday morning and first to complete paper work and it still took 25 minutes for them to call me. The person didn’t even take me to a room. She waited until the door was closed then in the middle of the hallway asked to see my arm and then said “ok I’ll let your employer know you’re cleared”. I understand that it’s a policy or whatever to not be open on Sundays, but if the standard is to have a TB test read within 24 hours and the clinic is open 24 hours; why can’t the nurses there just read it ?<//review>

I went in on a Saturday for pre-employment services. I was helped by the friendly receptionist Vanessa. She was really helpful and processed me fast! Then I was called back into the back office by a Male nurse named Ricardo. He was really friendly aswell. He did a great job at my blood draw and injections, really gentle. My overall experience at Concentra was excellent. I was treated good and didn't have to wait long. Thank you guys for great hospitality and great professionalism.</Text>

<review>I can here for a pre-employment physical and was pretty impressed. I especially liked how cautious they were with social distancing. The front desk was nice and helpful. The gentleman  that drew my blood was very nice and explained the process. When I expressed that I get nervous having blood drawn, he brought me fruit snacks and a bottle of water. I thought that was so kind. I wish I remembered his name. The do otro that saw me was thorough and explained the process well.< /review><Rate>5< /Rate><user>115728236184336432262<//user><Resp>None<//Resp><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I went there just for a TB test for work so maybe this isn’t the case for everyone. The wait is ridiculously long...but all the staff there are awesome! Front desk ladies were nice and a super friendly nurse helped me out while I was there. You can actually step out while you wait (I had to wait about an hour and half after signing in) and they call you when it’s your turn, which is nice so you can get some coffee and run an errand while you’re out.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dcd783bf9da653:0x682464014dc6f774<//gmap_id><Time>1602643521466< /Time>< rating>

<review>I went in for a drug screen test, for the most part it was quick and easy. For anyone that is going in for the same test, just know it can be done 24/7. I was told if I came in after 7 pm, i wouldn't have had to wait the 2 1/2 hours. Nice to know for next time. Nurses in the location are knowledge and friendly.</review></record>

<review>Had to find a clinic that would do a DOT physical on a Saturday on short notice. Countless hours and phone calls later concentra was the only clinic willing to do it. The staff was nice, professional, and quick.

Only con would be the price. Almost twice as much as other clinics but since I was starting a job the next day I needed my cert.</review><username>Rafael Lopez< /username>< GmapID>

I don't understand why the wait times are so extremely long, specially during a pandemic.
On my first visit I was told that my wait would be 3 hours just to be called. It was 8am and there were about 5 people before me.
So I set an appointment for another day. Got there
5 mins before set time. I had to wait for about 30 mins before I was called in. My entire time spent there was one and a half hour, just to check my temperature and blood pressure, give a urine sample and get a check by the doctor that just included listening to my lungs.<//Review>

<text>Was in line BEFORE it opened, and informed 2 hour wait. Asked if I can leave and come back, informed that if I get the call I must come in within 5 minutes otherwise will have to start the 2 hour wait again! Seriously. Doctor and medical assistant super nice, but front reception staff awful! 2 hour wait doing nothing except sitting in a hot car or cool car wasting gas.< /text><user_name>3 Hasees< /user_name><Pictures>None</Pictures><UserId.>102814421363438973631</UserId.>< gmap_id>

< Review>
The staff at the front desk was not very polite. They were slightly rude and short with patients. The waiting room only had 6 seats and everyone else’s was forced to sit in their cars or outside. Waiting outside in the heat is very uncomfortable. The wait to take a 2 minute urinalysis was 2 hours. Once I was seen, the technician that conducted the test was quick and friendly, as expected.  Sadly, I wouldn’t want go back to this facility.</Review>

Slowest clinic, out of all the clinics I’ve been to for drug screenings this is by far the worst,  they really just milk the day! Waited a total of almost 2 hours for a quick simple 3 minute drug screening. Be wary when picking this location, suggest new staff and/ or management.</text>

Long wait times. 5 hours for a physical. 2 hours for anything else. I had to come to this location multiple times in a week for my drug compliance for my new job. Staff was sweet, but they are very under staffed so I can’t even be mad at them. Concentra as a corporate should be ashamed of themselves for this. I won’t be back under any circumstances.</review>

This place is extremely crowded there was about 8 people sitting down on the chairs and about three people standing up leaning against the wall. No one checked temperatures nor did they ask about any covid like symptoms there was a patient coughing up a storm these people were sanitizing the charts if that makes you feel comfortable... looks like they were short staffed. The front office ladies looked stressed and body language showed they were annoyed (I get it) ***don't stress your employees out and get them extra help! I waited 1 hr and 40 minutes in the car before I was called in by the LVN.. I went in immediately and was not triaged, the nurse took my temp but barely placed the tympanic in my ear so that was inaccurate.. he takes me to another room and tells me we have to wait for a room to open up. I told him I waited over an hour and a half in my car and he says "Welcome to Workers Comp it's always this busy" I told him if I would be out in the next 45 min or so and he said no but let me see what I can do...he comes back with discharge form that says patient cant wait any longer and says this is the best I can do.. That right there readers is straight idgafreak mode lol.< /review>

<review>I have a primary doctor and I knew a workers comp doctor wouldn’t be the same experience but wow... if you sit there with a timer you will see every person is dealt with in 7 minutes tops! Made me realize they are not going to ask me any questions regarding ANYTHING. After I went in I sat for a good 5 minutes before I was bum rushed by the specialist TELLING me whatever it is he had to tell me and after if I was lucky to Stutter one question I’d get an answer... I have so many questions that I hope to get answers before I’m released, it’s unbelievable a person has to worry about how they’re going to squeeze questions in. I’m not one to complain but after suffering a biceps tendon tear at work I would have imagined these people would answer every and all questions. Man...<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I came in for a drug screening and a physical for a job and the wait time was around 2 hours but I found ways to kill time while waiting in the car and I even went to a nearby store. They call you on your phone when they're ready to see you. After being called in, the whole visit was very fast: it took about 15 minutes or less.

The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because as I was getting checked out, I awkwardly waited for a while to be acknowledged. One of the receptionists was busy helping the patients coming in but there were others that I saw enter a room to be on her phone and others that just walked by, some even made eye contact with me. No one mentioned anything along the lines of "I'll be right with you, please give me one moment".

I work at a pharmacy and I always let people know that I see them and if I can't get to them right away so that they don't think I'm ignoring them. I feel like that should be done here too. Also, I feel like some of the receptionists don't enjoy talking to some patients because I heard some attitude in their voices while they answered simple questions 👀

Overall, good experience! The parking was plentiful, even though there were many patients that day, and I love that it's close to Disneyland!<//Review>< Pics>

I waited so long, and I could hear the nurses practically yelling at the doctor to come check on me. When he finally did he was super fast, like barely was checking my previous injuries and then left me. It took less than a minute and they made me late to my PT appointment.

The Physical Therapy team is absolutely amazing. They are super helpful and Roman helped me heal faster than I expected.

<text>The people at the front of are very helpful also the health clerk. Unfortunately therapists, Docters and specialists treat you as a number not a patient, I went there with lower back pain, they made me pick up excessive weight, now pain has moved to my shoulder, they assume, that all people hurt the same and should heal at the same time, I've shared my experience with others and found that they've had same experience. If they can't heal your pain, they blame your age. Now I have to go elsewhere to heal my shoulder pain.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

The receptionist told me it would be awhile and I should wait in my car. It was 45 mins Before she called me. By the time I got out my car and to the front desk my nurse took another patient. Then I had to wait another 10 mins. I tried to urinate but by that time my kidneys reabsorbed it. So I waited another 45 mins until I could urinate.</Text>

I had an appointment scheduled and showed up on time for my appointment. I was in the waiting room for over an hour after my appointment was scheduled before I was taken back for a 2 min test procedure. I had to ask the staff why I hadn’t been called back and there was poor communication.</text>

I got there about 0720. They open at 0700. There was only 4 people total in the waiting room and it took about 2 hours and 15 minutes just to see the Dr. Then I was out in about 10 minutes. Who knows why the wait is so long but they just seem to take their time out , there<//Review>< Pictures>

I arrived 20 minutes early for my long awaited appointment just to wait two more hours in the waiting room. Understaffed, extremely crowded in the waiting area. While patients sit their waiting for hours couldn't help but notice the staff having the time of their lifes laughing and giggling and wondering why everyone in the waiting room was so upset terrible visit.</Text>

This location cannot manage itself. Every time I come for an appointment, my wait time increases. When they sent me to a specialist at another Concentra for tests, they just assumed I wasn't coming back to this location. Then followed about an hour of phone tag where I called one location, then the other, then the first, then the other, just trying to figure out what my next steps would be. On one occasion, they scheduled an appointment without telling me when or where it would be. Today, I waited an hour past my appointment time just to get into a room. There are some competent and really nice people here, but the whole system doesn't work together.</review>

I went in there for an injury I had at work and it took them about 3 hours for the doctor to finally see me and send me home even though there were 3 patients including myself. It also took them a while to get in into for my follow up even though I had an appointment. So if you can avoid them please do since I had no other choice</Review>

<Text>I first went in on a Saturday at 10:30am.  The staff was polite and cheerful and I was in and out within 20 minutes. I returned on Monday, arrived at 1135am for a TB reading, needless to say the place was packed. Again the staff was cheerful, polite and honest about the wait time.  I told them I did not mind waiting. Again I was out of there in a timely manner (12:45pm) 1 hour 10 minutes.  Thank you for a positive experience!<//Text><user_name>J. Thomas< /user_name>< Time>

This has to be the slowest place I have ever been to. I was there for 3 hour for my DOT physical. All the doctor did was tap me in a few places. That’s 3 hours of my life I’ll never get back. This place really needs to work on getting people on and out in a timely manner.< /Text>

<Text>I think the staff deals with there  patients accordingly. I was transferred from the Santa Fe Springs location. I got injured at work on January 22nd 2019. I seriously wished I would’ve gotten to this location in the first place. I have a meniscus issue with my knee and need surgery. The one person that I seriously couldn’t thank enough and appreciate her so much is Veronica. She went above and beyond of her job to help me out with everything I had to deal with. Insurance company, getting me where I’m at now. I’m getting my surgery done on 4/23/19. I seriously know that it’s because of her assistance that helped my situation along. Thank you Veronica!!!< /Text><user_id>100168880725644939773< /user_id>< gmap_id>

I had a great experience with Concentra. I went in for a physical, they were prompt and courteous. Missy helped me out and Raul was one of my nurses. Both care providers I saw were very nice and helpful when it came to my questions. Definitely recommend this place 👍<//text>

Waiting currently for 30 minutes after appointment time for follow up.... Hey it's better than Kaiser's "charge you 5 times the amount for using a non Kaiser office, even if one isn't close to you"<//text>

The medical history forms were emailed so that I could complete before my appointment.  On Monday,  my wait was short. Everyone was helpful and professional.  The doctor reviewed my available results and addressed any of my questions.  Overall a very pleasant experience.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Horrible experience!!! The only positive review sounds like that of an employee. I had to go here yesterday for a pre-employment physical that was scheduled for 4:30pm, it took them 1 1/2 hours to finally call my name to go to the back...  What's the point of an appointment then? When I arrived the waiting room had a good amount of people and then a good amount arrived after me but not once did I hear anyone say they had an appointment when they checked in, so why was there literally only two other people in the waiting room when my name was finally called? After doing the usual blood pressure check, eye exam etc with the X-RAY TECH not an MA or LVN, I will give him props though for filling SEVERAL rolls!  seems like he's taken advantage of... anyhow I am then told to wait in the exam room as he steps out. I then can hear him asking one of the of doctors if he can do the doctor's part of the physical to which he replies NO!!!  So then he ask an employee in the back where the other doctor is and if he can do the physical to which that person responses with why am I there so late for a physical? I should have been scheduled for 3pm at the latest blah blah blah and then starts talking smack about the other doctor about how he takes too long in the rooms and so forth. Anyhow the tech helping me comes back in and says I'm sorry but the one doctor can't do the type of physical your employer needs you to have but I'm going to ask the other doctor but he should have been off already so I'm not sure if he'll be able to either. If he can't then we'll do everything else and you'll need to come back and see the doctor...   of course he leaves and returns to tell me sorry the doctor can't see you today I have to come back at an earlier time... like seriously WTF that is sooooooooo unacceptable!!!  I'm not mad at the tech, he did his job and the job of at least three others quite well. I'm angry because I waited in total a little over two hours to be told to come back because the doctor should be off already when in reality I know they just wanted to go home at exactly 7pm so they didn't want to chance taking another patient and getting out late. However if you saw me come in at my scheduled appointment time of 4:30pm and you knew it should have been scheduled for earlier why wouldn't you expedite my paperwork?  Isn't that what an appointment is kind of for?  Plus it says on the door the you "close" at 7pm;  why am I being told the doctor should be off already? what happens with the patients that arrived after me?  You guys have someone play doctor from 6:30-7 for them?  If US Healthworks really did buy this place that explains A LOT!!!   From my experience they are by far the worst health care company I have ever had to unfortunately go to and their doctors are mediocre at best!  Stay away if you can!!!</text>

The staff is very friendly. There was a short wait. The doctors and nurses were very knowledgeable and willing to teach. Overall it was a good experience and they're willing to go out of their way, take extra steps to help you out. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and will use it next time I need any medical services provided to me.</Review>

I came for a physical last week (10/30), and the duration of my visit was about 1 hour and 15 minutes. I had a pleasant experience; the staff was great, the doctor was kind, and they had me in and out in a timely matter. Overall, very pleasant experience!<//text>

Once I was in the Physical went quick and the doctors and nurses were quick and professional. All in all, if you have any other options, don’t go here. Whoever’s job it is to schedule appointments deserves to be fired. If you’re going to make people wait 4 hours after their appointment time to get in, don’t set their appointment for that time. I definitely wasn’t the only one there that waited that long after my appointment either. Completely unacceptable.< /review>< pics>

Wait was over 4 hours and all I needed was a tetanus shot. After 4 hours they call you in just to take your weight and blood pressure just to send you back to the waiting room. Finally get in after that to wait another 40 mins to see the doctor just so I can wait another 30 so that the same nurse that took my blood pressure can give me my shot when she could of just done that hours ago?! I will not be going to my follow up just to wait 5 plus hours< /review>

<user>112595202895637019576<//user><review>Had an appointment for a physical at 1030am, but didnt get called in until 12pm. I received my TB test, tetanus, and had my labs drawn at 1230pm. They placed me in a room in which I waited until 130pm for an actual doctor to see me. Once I was allowed to go one of the front desk employees told me to come into the office in 2 days to get my TB test read and that I wouldnt have to wait in line. I came back 2 laters and the lady at the front desk told me to wait in line... almost an hour past by and I asked the front desk worker why am I waiting too long and the other worker 2 days ago said I didnt have to wait in line? She then continued to say "oh she was wrong. We need a doctor to read your TB results." Thr other worker next to her said she could do it.... I waited almost an hour because the front desk lady didnt know nurses could read TB tests!<//review>< user_name>

I went to Concerta for a pre-employment drug screening. At check-in, the front desk assistant was really helpful and friendly. The wait time wasn't bad for a midweek afternoon. And once I got called in for the test, the nurse was friendly, professional, and the whole process was pretty quick.< /text>

<Text>2nd patient after they opened. The only patient there for 20 minutes. Then it started filling up. After a 2 HR wait we left and went to another urgent care. Nothing like sitting for 2 hours in pain and watching everyone go in for treatment while you wait and were there before all of them.< /Text><Name>Cody Cone</Name>< response>

Sometimes you have to wait a while to see the doctor but I understand they don't have a lot of doctors on hand but the people there are friendly they talk to you joke with you they give you coffee if you want it water crackers it's all good they got a TV in the waiting room then make you very comfortable almost like waiting at home so I don't mind the way there is a female named Veronica that works at the Anaheim on Haster she is very very nice and very helpful she really deserves to be praised for her work I hope I mentioned in her name somebody will let her know and the doctors are good as well they also have a good sense of humor make you feel comfortable and thank you for giving me this opportunity to tell you how I feel about Concentra</Review>

Had to come in here for a physical. Was very impressed with the facility. It felt and looked real clean.
The staff is amazing. They all seemed to genuinely care about their jobs and I felt like they all wanted to be there. Which is something you would assume, but we all know that some people choose a career and just hate being there and make the process miserable for everyone else.<//Text>

< Review>
If had the option to give no stars I would. First time I. This place and very unpleasant experience here. It’s Thursday morning staff lady in front desk very nasty attitude not only did she give me attitude but to several clients. I review every new places I go to and this one just bothered me. I hope someone in a high range sees this and talks to the young lady because she’s the face of this place first person we all speak to and she can’t even smile. Horrible oh and my wait time 2 hours because they don’t accept appointments for my procedure.</Review>

To the young nurse whose parents are from Guerrero y Michoacan, sorry I never got your name but you're probably the best nurse I've ever had! Very caring, polite and kind things that are essential to be a great nurse but also a good person. Personally I never really liked going to the doctor's since it's always a drag and wait times are pretty bad but this time around, instead of feeling like they forgot about me, this nurse made me feel the complete opposite. She brought in snacks and juice and honestly made my experience ten times better. She was engaging and relatable.
I'm glad this clinic has people like her working there!
I recommend this place highly because of their friendly staff and yes wait times are bad just like everywhere else but at least here the people don't suck👍< /review>

<text>0. Very poor.
I took the blood draw on Tue. Oct 16, 2018. Usually,  at other clinics,  I got the lab result within 2 days.
However,  it is a week from the day they took my blood drawn,  I haven't received the lab results yet.
Therefore,  I can't come to work and missed my first assignment because I applied for travel job.
It is very bad. I totally disappointed about their service< /text>< pics>

With unusual circumstances and being from out of state all personnel treated me very politely and accommodated me in every way possible. It was nerve racking to have to find someplace to go while on vacation but once in the door it seemed as if I was at my home clinic. Thanks again</text>

Doctor Christopher Dobson is very professional, accommodating and very friendly.  As most, I have gone to multiple doctors and Dr. Dobson displayed a genuine concern for my injury.  He really took the time to understand how I received the injury and suggested possible solutions that fit me perfectly, not just a general solution.  Despite the multiple patients he had in the other rooms, he created a comfortable and non-rushed environment, while taking his time with each one. He also suggested follow up for the future that would be the best for me, and a lot of good information that could help me in the long term.  He was very accommodating to my schedule, as most doctors refer you to their staff and walk away.  I am very thankful that I found Dr. Dobson and look forward to my future appointments.< /review>

Had an appointment and had to wait for an hour for a simple pre-unemployment physical.  After I was brought back, I waited again.  Then I waited more.

For me to simply get weighed, measured, pee in a cup, eye test and agility took nearly 3 hours.< /Text>

Terrible.  This place is a prime example of what is wrong with health care in America.  I called them and heard a recorded message that claimed they were a 24 hour urgent care.  I looked them up online and their website claimed they were a 24 hour urgent care.  So I drove over there 6:10pm on a Sunday night.  The building has a beautiful sign that says 24 urgent care - OPEN.  So I went in and was told that they only handled workplace injuries (whatever that means) after business hours.  There is a sign outside the entrance in the back of the building that lists the actual urgent care hours.  How many people waste their time driving to this location only to find out that they are not, in fact, a 24 hour urgent care? When I related this story to my wife she told me the same thing happened to her at another Concentra location. Why would Concentra advertise in such a misleading way?  I can only imagine a combination of greed and apathy.  Exceptionally frustrating.<//text>

<Review>Any doctor can call himself or herself MD, but very few can be real healers. I recently had an experience with Doctor Christopher Dobson at Concentra in the Anaheim location on Anaheim blvd.
Doctor Dobson listens to his patient's complaints, examines, diagnoses and helps. In today's day and age MD should stand for more dollars, very few doctors qualify as healers. Doctor Dobson's bedside manners are superb and unequivocal.
He is an asset to the Concentra organization, he should be commanded for his patient treatment and care. At a time when the patient is most vulnerable and in pain he or she needs the sympathetic ear of the practitioner, doctor Dobson's compassion and sympathy helps more than any prescription.
Compassion and caring should be studied alongside medicine names in all medical schools.</Review>< name>

<Text>It is a walk in bases.. no greet when you come in and you just wait until someone is available to help and besides been told that just give it a fee minutes until they call you back you wait till all the people after you get called back and besides when asking what is the status to call you back, they dont know. Terrible service for a drug screen for work and was there almost 2 hours. Irritated.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

No sense of urgency experienced at this Urgent Care facility. Literally have something stuck in the patient's eye and they did a vision test (after waiting for 90-mins and being told there's only one other urgent care patient) and checked vitals, but over 2-hours and the patient still hasn't seen a doctor.  He just wants the object removed from his eye. At least it's not bleeding, I guess.< /Text>

<Text>why would you advertise on the Internet and on the phone that you are 24 hour urgent care but fail to mention ANYWHERE that you don't accept walk-ins after 8? whoever recorded the phone message and put "24 hours" on here needs to get their life together and learn to do their job. that's kind of an important detail to just leave out, dumbasses.<//Text></record>

< review>
We live in San Jose but we're in Anaheim at Disneyland the past few days.  Friday afternoon my husband got sick and by Saturday morning had a 105° fever and coughing so hard he was having a hard time breathing.  Being that we live so far away, we didn't know where to go.  Google said Concentra on Anaheim was the closest urgent care.  We did go about 2pm, during Urgent Care hours.  The staff was great and due to his condition was taken right away.  We were there a total of an hour and left with the medication he needed to feel better and make it home.  Thank you to the doctor and staff at Concentra yesterday afternoon.  Your compassion and professionalism didn't go unnoticed.  Should we require medical care on any future trips to Disneyland, we will be sure head in to see you.< /review>

The service I received in the back was fine for actual physical but in the front office I arrived at 10am for my scheduled appointment but it took 2hrs.& 50mins. before I actually got to see anyone. People were walking in off the street and wondering how long it would take to see someone and they were always told that it would be 45mins.
I kept going up to the window to see what was taking so long and I was given a lot of excuses and at one point they held up a file and said "this is you and you are next so it shouldn't be long now"But it was still almost another hour before I saw anyone. I had another appointment across the county and after being at your office for 4-5 hrs. I barely made it to that appointment when I was sure I would have several hours between appointments. I still don't understand how this is possible.<//Text>

Up front and honest about how long the wait is. (3 hr wait)Only thing it smelt like urine as soon as you opened the door. Looks clean but smells like a Medicare nursing home.</review>

this place is not an urgent care. they urgently make money from the people getting their pre employment tests and physical done. but when an actual sick person with insurance and ability to pay cash for the whole thing actually needs help and has a high grade fever. they let about 30 people in in front of them so they can make their money and not care about real sick people. DON'T GO THERE UNLESS YOU NEED A PRE EMPLOYMENT SCREENING  DONE.
and they conveniently say they can't verify your insurance and turn you away when you have been there before. WITH the same insurance.</text>

Drove 15 miles at 10:00 PM. Hours say 24, nope. Turns out it's specific to a certain type of injury? I doubt I'm the first person to be mislead but the crap rating by so many people just reaffirms it. Awesome.<//Review>

<Text>The only day I was properly treated was the day of the injury, the following visits not at all, when for eye burn due to a solution, have my eye washed and treated on Monday, Tuesday just took 2 minutes to get dismissed, open your eye look up, now look down, now look to your left, now to your right, now you can go home. Never really check the burn on my cornea, according  to dr. the side of my cornea look something abrasive, term that the following to visits and 2 different drs skip, so I question dr on Wednesday about that and set me up with an eye dr for Thursday, so a said I couldn't came on Thursday and he said I have to  come to my appointments because this was an injury, I said tomorrow is my dad's sister funeral, then he said they are bringing an eye dr for me, and surprise I was seen by a regular dr, and back to open your eye move to both sides and he told me stop the eye drops by the way he check my right eye I had to tell him that was the wrong eye, and  released me. Hope you understand my disappointment. I feel I wasn't treated professionally</Text><time>1534869207984< /time>< userid>

<Review>Everyone is decently nice but i was scheduled for a physical at 9. I showed up 15 mins early to fill out my paperwork.  Wasnt seen until almost 10:30 and I didn'tend leaving until 11:30.  Mind you I had to fast the night before.  Got pretty hangry. My first time for the same physical only took 35 mins. Need to schedule and prioritize more efficiently. But like i said they're kind people.</Review><resp>None<//resp><user_name>Ray Fuller<//user_name>< userid>

<text>The wait time was over two hours. We were finally shown into a room that was obviously dirty. The table paper was crinkled and there were crumbs from chips on it. There was also torn pieces of paper on the floor. They had one provider trying to tackle both occupational medicine plus the urgent care. I attempted to clean the room myself. Imagine my surprise when I saw there were no cavi wipes or any sort of cleaning supplies to disinfect the room. We were finally seen by the provider who barely spent more than 2 minutes in the room examining me and my daughter. He gave us both a z pack and sent us on our way. As a concentra employee in a different state  it is sad to see the lack of patient care. Hopefully it was just an “off” day.< /text>< name>

<Text>This place was over one hour late to see me for a scheduled appointment for which I was an hour early, so two hour wait time total.

When I first arrived the lady at the front tried to joke with me that I was a "bad boy" for not having a form filled out even though I got there super early.

The nurses or people that were administering the physical left me over 3 times and had me wait. They also failed twice to draw blood, saying that I had small veins as an excuse. The supervisor eventually got blood and said that I actually don't have small veins.

I had to go find help from the staff twice, because I am sure that they forgot that I was waiting.

I would seriously avoid going here.<//Text></record>

<text>Waited 2 hours to be seen for a physical and PPD for work. Asked the PA to do a rapid strep test as my throat was soar, felt fatiqued, and feverish. She told me I'd have i'd have to get back in line again and register separately (which would be another 2 hours plus). A rapid strep test takes less than 3 minutes in total. Poor attitude and service from the PA. I cannot recommend this urgent care.</text><response>None</response>< Rating>

<Review>Currently here waiting so I thought just to give these guys a review. Blows. Had an appointment at 10. Still waiting to be seen and it’s 11:20. Plan to spend your whole day here. It’s as worse as the DMV. Staff are ok but slow AF.</Review>< Pics>

I scheduled an appointment for 10:15, arrived timely. No one asked me at the check in, if I had an appointment. I thought, they knew. I waited until 11:30 (!!), until I ginally,lost my patience, & asked why was I waiting so long, & others people, who arrived later, were seen before me. They told me, they had appointments, & I was Walk in. I got very mad. I told them, I scheduled an appointment, asked for the I manager. Manager set there, approached front office clerks, who were shaking in fear, looking at screen, & swearing to me, I didnt have an appointment. I Never had an issue like that before! I wasted 3 hoirs in that awful place, instead of 30 min, like previosuly. Never again!! Zero for customer care, in addition to staff, that bluntly lies to customers!!<//review>

<review>Because of your incompetence of not carefully taking the time to perform a proper physical and correctly fill out documentation, I am now put in a position where I could lose my job as a driver due to the fact that in your notes you placed me as diabetic. When I am NOT! And to follow up with the MD in 3
months. Come to find out I had to waste 4 hours in line at the DMV when I could have been working only to be rejected. As a result of your lack of commitment to the career you chose. If this isn't sorted out by the end of this week I could lose my job. I am the sole breadwinner of my household. You see the problem here?</review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Maby it was the time of day? 6am. I was the only one there. I had just went to the rest room at work before they gave me the drug test paper work. I didn't need to go when I got to your clinic. I asked the young man there if I could take a blood test and he kindly said no that it had to be urin. He said I could take my time and drink coffee or water. So for the next half hour I got to taste all of your great flavored coffees. When I was full of all your delicious COFFEE. I took my drug test. The young man just let me Injoy watching the FX movie with no pressure. He was a nice kind guy. Vanella was my favorite.< /Review><response>None<//response>< Pics>

This is NOT a 24 hour urgent care. Unless you have a work related injury. It's listed without this caveat in Google, and when I called, the recording simply says that they are open 24/7. However, when I arrived to the door at 6:30 am on a Sunday, there is a sign that states urgent care is only mon -fri 8-6 and Saturday from 8 until aroubd 5. The rest of the time is only for work related injuries.
I rang the doorbell to be let in so that I could confirm that there is no urgent care at this time, no one ever came to the door.</Text>

Horrible service, horrible doctors.

Arrived on time for a 3:15 "appointment" it's now 5:15 and I've had to argue with a doctor about
what he is seeing me for. They need to follow there protocols as Instructed by the people who send me there. They have no business trying to hassle about other issues not related to this visit. Would give 0 stars if possible< /Text>

Unfortunately for me, I was referred to  this Urgent Care for a Worker’s Comp injury.  After a couple of phone calls with a few arguments (due to lack of paperwork), I told this location that I was being referred by Concentra Telemed app.

Only after, I had seen 2 other doctors on the Concentra Telemed app, I was being referred to an in-person provider (prescribers on the app can’t provide any medication); Therefore, the doctor’s orders read: Patient reports lack of otc meds so will go to center for prescription meds and refer to physical therapy.  Because the max dose of over-the-counter (otc) meds (3200 mg of Motrins & 4000 mg of Tylenol) I was taking weren’t helping nor were the ice pack, heating pad, Bengay, Icyhot, or a massage.

After two weeks, with the same injury, I was told that I had to wait 4 hours to be seen by a doctor, so from 3 ½ hours I waited. After waiting   I was told that I would be getting rx strength Naproxen and a large Thermacare wrap (I can buy anywhere). I turned down the Naproxen and asked for something else, the doctor told me they can only give Motrin 600, Tylenol 500, or steroid.

Usually, you see a Doctor to tell you useful information regarding your diagnosis and give prescriptions when otc meds fail. I would not come here if you have access to a local pharmacy or even the Internet. I wasted my time for something I could have done myself. Yep, I sat there and wasted 4 hours of my life being told something I already know and given something I already have (Thermacare wrap).

This is the WORST  Urgent Care I have ever been to.< /review>

Apparently these people dont know the meaning of OPEN 24HRS like they claim to be. Once we got there they had their hours of operation posted on the window. We went on a Sunday morning thinking it was open because when you look it up, it says open 24hrs. Just to have some guy that looked like the janitor tell us it was closed.</review>

Service is bad at Concentra Urgent Care. I filled out my paperwork that they require the patient to fill out. I sat around for four and a half hours before I was called in to start my physical. I was there a total of seven hours. What a nightmare.</Text>

<Text>The Staff at Concentra (this location specifically) NEEDS TRAINING.  Their lack of  knowledge regarding veins or the angle of needle to secure sample blood and  have caused multiple trips by patients based on their lack of knowledge.  They also make patients WAIT for hours and do not honor appointments.  I would never return to this company!</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dcd783bf9da653:0x682464014dc6f774<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Bad experience, 3/4/21, this day I waited almost 5 hours because I did not have an appointment and during that time about 50 people passed and I felt like they did not want to tend me, their system very bad and the resection ones, they do nothing for pass to one pir that they are the ones that order the list👎👎
