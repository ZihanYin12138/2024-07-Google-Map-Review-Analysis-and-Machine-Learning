Amazing food. Located at the Alpenhof Lodge, across the street from the Canyons Center, this is old world atmosphere coupled with a modern culinary approach.<//Review>

Unfortunately, Mammoth does not have a lot of higher-end restaurants but Petra is definitely a solid option for foodies.

Service is very good and the food is well priced given the quality.

Order the Baked Brie or the Duck Confit as an appetizer...Salmon or Short Ribs for Main Course.

ENJOY!< /Text>

I recommend you ask the server if they can do an entree of the Duck Confit. The legs are cooked perfectly and the risotto compliments it wonderfully. The bolognese hits the spot if you’re craving pasta with a nice meat sauce. The portions are healthy so come hungry.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEGay0qVu7Cu4-HeOg1G6QcMZzj9WrKqZLK3z7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsdt9Ziy3IkFaro0CHvHCzjH5PNHHLojTIGNoK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< resp>

<text>We arrived and there was a confusion about our reservation. Petra’s did what a great customer centric business should do, and made it right. They found us a place and we had an exceptional meal! And this is why when I make a reservation for lodging in Mammoth my next phone call and is to Petra’s for a reservation. I luv everything about this place food, drinks and service. ❤️< /text>< pics>

<text>What a great spot! The food is delicious - no detail is missed. My short ribs were “melt in your mouth” perfect, and my husband’s steak was perfection. Ahi poke tacos are so flavorful - a perfect little starter. The wine list is great - it features a ton of small, CA wineries, and the staff is well-trained on all of them. All in all, this is one of our new favorite places in Mammoth!</text>< Pictures>

<text>The food was really delicious (you can expect the same food quality as in a French restaurant) and worth the price (which is reasonably high).
The wine is a bit overpriced but their wine list is huge and you can find anything from all over the world.
The service was acceptable until the moment they bring the bill: they announce a 18%gratuity fee for groups of 6 people or more but it seems that our waitress  decided to add it to our bill  even if we were only 2 sitting at our table and their only explanation to that is that they use to do that with tourists to make sure they get a decent tip!
So in case you're a tourist like we were (and like the 90% of customers they should have) you can expect to be charged with the "tourist fee"!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I went this evening to this restaurant. We wanted with my wife to have a good dinner.
2 starters to share with sparkling wine, 2 steaks with a very good bottle on wine a total of 250$.
We asked the waiter to change the mash potatoes for my wife with haricots verts (served with another main course) they told us that this will be an extra cost or 2$ ????
I told us that it was unacceptable so I will just eat what I havé ordered and nothing else (no wine, ...)
And of course no tip.

Then what ... Nothing... nobody tried to solve that with is nobody talked with us... crazy and unprofessional.

Forget this restaurant.<//text>

Veggies beware
No entries on menu last night for those who dont eat meat or fish.  Offered solution:: pasta dish without the shrimp was weak and was billed as if the shrimp were still there.  In total, 2 apps (cheeze plate and baked bree) and 1 salad were the only options.< /Review>

There were a number of mistakes makes during the course of our service. Our server seemed distracted when taking our order and was not attentive at all throughout our dinner. When the manager came by, he seemed more interested in making excuses for the poor service than trying to understand our situation. Additionally, the manager had no interest in trying to make things right. This was the lowlight of our trip, but fortunately, we had wonderful experiences having dinners at The Mogul, Campo, and Nevado's.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Super friendly service, and the food was highly recommended. Here are my 5 full stars!
The bolognese was good, my girlfriend had chicken breast with rice and vegetables and that was outstanding. Was really jealous 😬

Not a bad gym especially when it’s not crowded. Wondering why most patrons get to not wear a mask, or have it pulled down under their noses the whole time? Possibly for the same reason that only Fox News run on the TVs...<//Review>

Friendly staff and a clean facility. Im used to going to 24 hour fitness or golds gym .10dollars a month.Dumbbells go up to 75lbs. A variety of machines including  the smith machines (I know) tredmils and sit up benches. No barbell bench, squat rack or dead lift barbells which will lead me to going to another gym. Planet fitness isn't for seasoned body builders for sure because their just isn't enough weight to lift. But if your a beginner, short on cash, just tryna do cardio, not tryna become a beast than planet fitness is for you. Some people here are actually tryna make gains.At the end of the day you can do what ever you wanna do!</Text>

<text>I love this gym. For $30 i get to bring a guest with me at any time no charge to them, i get to use their tanning beds (theyve got the stand up and regular ones!) And their massage chairs & hydro massage....i go at least 3 times a week for several hours. Its a huge facility too and even when alot of people are there at the same time, its never crowded feeling. BUT - this is my only but- they dont have any scales....still love the place though! So worth the money!</text><resp>{'time': 1619441690511, 'text': "Thank you for the 5 star review, Whitney!

<Text>Staff including Manager do not enforce the mask policy.  There are signs everywhere that mask must be worn up.  The first week many people pulled them down, the second week they have them completely off.  It would be a shame if the gym has to close again because people aren't following the guidelines.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I have been a member of planet fitness for several years. Super nice people and restrooms and locker area are always clean. My issue is I like to use the 30 minute circuit area. Well I can't because people come into the circuit area to just stay on one machine  for extended periods of time and then get mad at me because I want to do the whole circuit without having to stop. The same machines are out on the floor. Even asking for help from staff does not work. I quit going for a couple of years. It was not worth the anxiety. I started back up again back in March and I have run into the same problem. I once again stopped going and have taken to walking 3 to 4 miles around town.  Seriously thinking about cancelling my membership.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The ten bucks a month also includes the massage chair with a couple of TVs to watch and Tanning booths. It's a nice gym for the size of Paso Robles.

I’ve been going here on and off for about four years, and have been worked up to coming nearly every day since I got my license last year. Most of my workout is done on the elliptical and rowing machines, but there are weights I can use if I want to do a bit of strength training. I have the black card membership, so I always use the massage chairs or beds afterwards (I don’t use the tanning beds due to the potential for skin damage and premature aging) They don’t have some of the amenities you might find at Kennedy, such as a pool or a steam room, but that’s obviously because it’s so much more affordable. However it is extremely annoying when no one is manning the front desk and you want to use the massage chairs or beds etc or want to buy something and you have to go like find someone in the back which is hard when you have anxiety. There should always be one person at the front desk to help people with stuff like that in my opinion, and if they don’t want to hire more staff switch to automated system that allows people to check in on their own. Also, the wifi is often spotty and doesn’t work when there’s a lot of people. I wish they would shell out for a larger bandwidth so that we could all use the internet even when it’s busy.<//Text>

<Review>I really like Planet Fitness. Good variety of machines and the cost you cannot beat. I just think a steam room would kick it up to 5 star. Also there weekend hours are pretty slim... would love it if they where open a bit earlier on Sat & possibly later.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80ecc5a181fbf85f:0xe5ffc833b9c0c1e8<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>4</rating><text>So far, I like it a lot.  It would be nice if they had longer weekend hours.  Early Saturday morning is my favorite workout time.  I have a black card membership, and their hydrotherapy massage tables are wonderful after a workout.  Nice variety of machines, kept clean, and a large number of them too; so, you don't need to wait for a machine.  More weight machines would be nice.  I also wish the trainer was there more often, though it's nice that you get unlimited training with membership.  Friendly, helpful staff, but even better if more were working at the same time.  I love their no lunk rules!  I am an overweight man trying to improve my fitness and health, and I feel comfortable, welcome, and not judged when I work out there.  I was nervous about exercising in public, but I am able to be comfortable enough to "get in the zone" when I am there.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I actually just walked past Planet Fitness. It looks like a nice place yo work out. A gentleman stopped  his car beside as I walked by and asked if I minded him giving me $10. I said if course not, and he said a prayer and drove off.
Some people simply amaze me. Thank you Planet Fitness customer.</text>

<Review>It's a gym, it does what gym things do. There isn't really anything that stands out, but they do what they need to in order to meet my needs.

There are no classes, pools, organized anything. Come here, lift weights, do cardio, then go home.

I find it no more or less intimidating than any other gym, but I was in decent shape when I started so maybe my experience differs from others.< /Review>< user>

<text>Overall just great.  I like just showing up and doing my workout whenever I want.  I also love the low price per month.  No other gym comes close to the 10 bucks a month.  Great gym for free weights, treadmills, etc.  My only gripe is they are not a true 24 hour gym.  They open and close at 7 Saturdays and Sundays, which, for me, can be an issue.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<text>Planet Fitness is franchise gym that I have been to at least 53 plus times across the United States. The negatives were obvious with broken or missing equipment: broken TVs, old style open gym showers and small men's locker room. The positives of this gym were definitely hard to find. I would skip this gym location but I would likely recommend Planet Fitness gym across the nation to any beginning exerciser due to its' $10 membership fee or its' $20 fee for access around the United States for a person travelling.< /text>< Rate>

< Review>
I became a member about 7 months ago. The main reason was because I was homeless and needed a place to shower without having to feel like a burden to friends and family. I also have arthritis and have massage beds and chairs that help very much. I love the fact that it is a no judge zone. For $20 a month you get a lot of things. Now that I am not homeless I keep my membership for the massage tables and chairs.< /Review>

The no "grunting" rule kinda comes off a bit stupid to me. Pictures of cartoon guys with muscles with an 🚫 through it? Kinda weird since it's a gym, maybe a bit sexist. But its cheap, and they do have nice people working there.< /text>

I am traveling across the country with my boyfriend and we are using our PF memeberships to use showers and massages along our way. This was by far the worst planet we have been to yet.
When we came in no one was at the desk to scan us in and there wasn't an employee in sight so we just walked in unsure what to do.

ALSO THE MENS SHOWER IS A GROUP SHOWER WITH A GARDEN HOSE EQUIPPED TO THE WALL. This immeadiatly freaked both me and my boyfriend out and he did not shower. For being a judgemental-free zone you would think they would include privacy.
The women's shower head was rusted and sprayed in a wide radius.

We didn't see a single employee while there until we walked by the desk on our way out and there was someone in the office just playing on his phone. Very unprofessional.</Text>

Gave up membership . Hassled to get off equipment when I only had been on lipitical machine less than 5 minutes.  Staff looked on, gave no intervention, even after acknowledging this person did this to pther members.   Spa works in  men's restroom. But not the women's. Not going to repair it either according what staff stated.  Had  joined  do my work in a positive environment.  A line of tv's. Told at sign up staff can change channel to whatever you want to watch. After sign up, every tv is on the food or CNN channel. When you ask to view something else, staff ignore your request.  Then , when asked for the second time,  staff say "oh the owners don't want the channel changed off the food channel. " so off to another gym who are interested in your  work out experience,  not just your automatic payment.<//Review>

place seems cool...one problem though. $15.00 No Committment, No Catches, No Kidding! memberships are far from that. Technically Catch 1.)There is a committment that states you will be charged in the contract $58.00 for cancelling...Catch 2.) you have to give 7 days notice to cancel. Catch 3.) you can pay cash or credit to sign up for $39.00 plus your $15.00 mothly, however you also have to provide your bank account for monthly payments as well.(that's a big catch)

So, there are a lot of committments, catches are you kidding me going on haha just thought ya'll should know.

Mark, ps ... looks great inside though.<//review>

Beautiful interior, efficient, and convenient! I like the electronic sign in and the ability to pick a station for a particular person. My gal was quick and overall it was pretty painless. I came with a friend who got her waxing done and she comes frequently :)

I would recommend and will probably come back for my eyebrows and upper lip 12.99$ (paid debit)

4/5 stars because I need to come back for consistency but I'm hopeful I will be satisfied with their service again!<//text>

Awesome place to get your eyebrows threaded. They do other services but i have never used them. Might take a bit to register since not everyone knows how to work it but its worth the wait.< /text>

I was in and out in about 10 min. It felt quick for everything i had done and but also felt like she took her time ane cared on how my eyebrows looked. It was also a great price. Ill be going back again.< /review>< pictures>

Don't be full by the 2.3 miles, for me was difficult because how quick I was going and I don't do great with elevation, when I started to slow down that's when I enjoyed it, beautiful view, dog friendly with leash at all times, I went on a Thursday and the traffic was great!</text>

A stunning walking trail. This is a true gem, with amazing views of the coast and Golden Gate Bridge. It can be crowded depending on the day and weather. Several different trails you can take, highly recommend!<//Text>

If you havent already, get to this peak. It's a challenge, but the views are your reward. Bring water and of it's too hot, please don't subject your dog to such conditions. Dogs have died here due to heat stroke. I implore you avoid it. However, there are plenty of pet-friendly trails that will keep you and your furry companion happy and safe.</Text>

Incredible. This park had breathtaking views. Walk down to one of the beaches and see if you can see the mussels on the rocks or any of the caves. There's so many wildflowers that are indigenous to the area. Would go again in a heartbeat!<//review>

Great hike. Steeper than Cowel's but shorter and the view is amazing from the top. You can see Santee and the ocean from the same spot!</text>

I have an affinity and love for Mission Trails. The trails are well cared for, and you couldn't ask for a more accessible location. It's impressive how this natural park can be situated smack in a central location to just about anywhere in San Diego, yet maintain its natural beauty and feeling of isolation. Kwaay Paay mountain is central to the park, but the trail heads (there are two) are only found on the east side of the park. Being just over a mile oh, it's a super short trail. It starts out as more of a rolling, gentle climb, and gets a little more intense near the end. As you close in on the peak, there are a few areas that are going to require some rock scrambling, although it's nothing that can't be handled easily with a trekking pole. Have fun!<//text>

Incredible. This park had breathtaking views. Walk down to one of the beaches and see if you can see the mussels on the rocks or any of the caves. There's so many wildflowers that are indigenous to the area. Would go again in a heartbeat!</Review>

<date>1520808017131<//date><Rate>5</Rate><Review>Trail is marked "difficult" or 3 out of 3. People of all ages and physical shapes made it to the top - but I wouldn't say this trail was easy! Take your time, if needed, but there not no benches to take stops and the trail gets very narrow with tree brush throughout the hike. Also remember your water! I didn't notice any water or trash stations on this specific trail. The peak is really pretty though with a 360 view and there are dozens of large rocks to use as a seat once you're to the very top. I'm a BEGINNER hiker and it took me around 1 1/5 hours to make it to the top with many breaks. Worth it!!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMaRKma0wLX0LNDYRJafFyDDPm97jQ8kSGmwTOf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNR5lBcXnqWLEl5_tTsA-4Ah0skmcf2dxsc1tSS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMAx15Dnfxe-7hyPwP1eoYNDD4QpjbVRv0S48h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

Great hike, took about 1.5 hours. On a clear day can see a lot of ocean and a ton of peaks out east. Great little local hike.</Review>

Fantastic trip on the path less taken.  We got a dose of nature(flies of a sort) which kept any break short.  At the peak the breeze was cool and sun warm.
I always carry a little trash bag for removing other's accidental trash, and my bag was empty getting back.  (The area was nice and clean)
Be prepared and have fun.<//Text>

<Review>Nice quick hike.  It can be challenging at times due to the steepness, both up and down.  Bring lots of water, especially during the summer months.  And during those summer months, please leave your pets at home.  They can't cool themselves like us!</Review>< Pics>

Nice quick hike.  It can be challenging at times due to the steepness, both up and down.  Bring lots of water, especially during the summer months.  And during those summer months, please leave your pets at home.  They can't cool themselves like us!< /text>

Amazing views at the top. A little steep in a few parts with a 900ft gain. Well worth the time. A round trip of 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</review>

It's a great hike and unlike most San Diego hikes it's well shaded. 4 stars because the trail really does need to be filled in for safety<//Review>

<date>1548215292970</date><review>I wouldn't say this is my least favorite of the 5 Mission Trails peaks, but it comes in 2nd to last, only behind Pyles. I take the longer side route that has more ups and downs in the beginning. The top half of this can be brutal. Big steps when you are at your most tired. View is just ok of the visitor center side of the MT area.</review>< Response>

<review>A lower peak than Cowles, and the trail doesn't offer great views on the way up, since it's on the east face. Still, a good change of pace if you're used to the Cowles/Pyles climb.< /review>< user_id>

From start to finish I am completely impressed with Raceway Electric. Mike (the owner) came out to my home and discussed with me what projects I wanted done. After the meeting I was provided with a complimentary quote and lighting options.

Our condo complex needed to upgrade from fluorescent lighting to LED. We had everything you can think of. Porch lights, pool lights, parking lights and pole lights that needed to be replaced.

The two electricians, Billy and Sam,  arrived at the beginning of the appointment window and walked the job with me. I knew I was in good hands with these two. They arrived clean and ready to work. The electricians worked in separate areas of our complex to ensure the job was complete in great time.

Our new lights look amazing and definitely bring more of a stylish look to our complex. This was a much needed upgrade and we could not have done it without Raceway Electric!<//Text>

Billy was on time, and very professional.  I didn't really care how the power got from A to B, but he made sure to make it more aesthetically pleasing.  Definitely would recommend!  Thanks guys!!<//text>< pictures>

Sam & Billie arrived promptly and took the time to go over the work order with me, I was grateful for that and it gave me an opportunity to make some changes. They were professional and knowledgeable and didn't seem to mind my questions. I would use them for any and all electrical jobs that will come my way in the future.  Thank you Raceway Electric for the stellar service.</Text>

We bought our first house recently and the electrical was not allowing us to function. We quickly needed new outlets in the kitchen, outside, recessed lighting in the family room, entrance way, and kitchen, dimmers in the bedrooms, and there was a ceiling fan that was moved unprofessionally that left live wires hanging from the ceiling. Mike came out shortly after I called and did a complete walk-through. He was beyond nice and didn’t want to go with any other company. The two men that came to our home to do the jobs were unbelievably nice and professional. They genuinely enjoy their jobs and walked us through everything that was being done. At no point did we have to question a thing. Mike even came by during the job to check in. Such a great company and couldn’t thank them enough for helping us with our home. *HIGHLY RECOMMEND*<//text>

Mike is really great to work with.  He is very straight forward, explained things in a way I could understand when installing my solar panels and upgrading my electric panel.  I am very happy with the install and so glad I chose Raceway over several other companies I considered.  I highly recommend Mike and Raceway Electric.</Review>

We heard about Raceway through our realtor (who had used them for a number of years for their own properties). On the day of installation, Billy and Sam arrived on time, and were very professional and personable. Billy took our requests/needs into account for the install, and suggested very logical options that would work for the room size. We went with Billy's recommendations, and everything turned out excellent! They both worked very efficiently and answered any questions we had along the way.
Thank you guys!

A few weeks after the install, we noticed one of the fans (Brand: Minka Aire)  was making a ticking noise while operating at higher speeds. Raceway sent Sam to take a look. He figured out the problem in a few minutes, and made the correction (putting two 2" sections of gasket material 180deg apart between the ceiling and the base cover). No more ticking!!
Per the fan retailer and Raceway, this is a common issue with this brand of fans.

We intend to use Raceway for future projects.
Highly recommended!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< gmapID>

A friend recommended Raceway Electric for my electrical upgrades, and I'm extremely happy that I contacted them. Mike provided detailed recommendations on the issues I wanted fixed (bathroom & kitchen outlets, recessed lights, moving outlets, grounding issues, etc.), and informed me about electrical standards and code. The staff is always quick to answer and return my calls, which I think is a sign of professionalism and taking their business seriously. I would highly recommend Raceway Electric to friends and family.< /Text>< name>

I have known Mike for some time now and I have referred him business to  people needing to upgrade their electrical panel, add can lights, do a whole house remodel, and a room addition.  He is honest, ethical and stands by his word. He loves his family and has been in business for close to 30 years.  This is somebody I trust and you should too!< /Review>

I was using a previous electrician but they increased their rates quite a bit.  Found Raceway Electric in Santee Magazine and thought I would give them a try - keep the spend local.  I am so glad I called! Sam is wonderful - I am getting ready to bring him out on a third job for us. They are now my go-to for any electrical work I need. Highly recommend them.<//Text>

I had another company install my solar 8 years ago and I wish I had Raceway Electric do it back then! Mike’s crew did a great job removing the panels and then reinstalling with all the correct stands and flashing to ensure a great leak proof installation. My favorite thing about Mike was his attentive and prompt customer service. He answered his phone or called me back every time. He communicated every step of the way and his crew was on time and got the job done on schedule. Very professional company and great service. I would use him again and I will be recommending him to anyone that needs electric repairs, installation or PV solar, Raceway Electric ROCKS!<//Text>< Pics>

<review>Mike at Raceway Electrician is very experienced.  Watched him work on a panel inspection and replacement.  Mike is always doing his best to inspect electrical systems while taking note of the accompanying warning signs (if any).  Electrical systems catch most homeowners off guard and seem to break out of the blue.  Mike coaches everyone take note if flickering lights or appliances start running out of the norm.  These are usually signs of an electrical issue taking place.  Call Mike before this issue turns into a house fire in the middle of the night.</review>< Pics>

We had questions about our electrical panel and needed some recommendations.  We found out about Raceway from three different sources and gave them a call.  Mike came out to our service cal and was very detailed and informative about all our questions.  Mike recommended a simple and basic panel inspection and evaluation.  Mike had his office set up an appointment and about two weeks later a tech came to perform the inspection.  Both men were extremely professional, courteous and answered any questions or explained any work.  Definitely would use Mike and Racdway again.< /text>

The office staff was very courteous in setting up appointments, the installation crew was very friendly and helpful as well. And when there was a problem with our fan  someone was sent back out the very next morning to get it working for us again. Very happy with all aspects of this company. Highly recommend them installation of a whole house fan!< /Review>

We called Raceway because we had flickering lights in several rooms. They have a good website with their contact number easily visible and an option to book an appointment online based on a menu of their services. I thought that was clear and convenient. I booked an appointment online and someone followed up by phone to confirm the details. The Electrician showed up as scheduled and was able to resolve the issue although he warned us that there could be further issues with the electrical panel but he recommended seeing if the problem stopped there before going further. We did have to call them out again because we saw flickering lights in different rooms now. The owner himself came out the same day we called and resolved the issue. I was impressed with their technical knowledge, responsiveness, and professionalism. No complaints. They are not cheap, but electrical problems are not where I try to bargain shop.< /Text>

Since a major demo we have continued to have major electrical problems and feared that an incompetent contractor left us with a possible whole level to be rewired. I was able to schedule an appointment for less than a week later, Mike showed up within the time frame given and after discussing the issues at hand he went to work immediately testing all electrical outlets (he looked concerned with our same thoughts on rewiring). In about 30 mins he was able to find that all these issues were related to one single broken electrical outlet, he looked more relieved than I was! Mike was very excited with his findings and demonstrated that he is truly passionate about his work and providing exceptional customer service. I would highly recommend them and have not had any issues since!<//review>

Juan and Carlos came out to do the work a few days later. Brian made sure the office took care of all the paperwork including the permits he was
on top of it and was there at the inspection for the rough and Final. This is not the first time I have dealt with an electrician I have a service busin
ess of my own and I must say they are highly organized as a company overall. There is definitely more work to be done in my house and will be calling the
m again shortly.< /review>

I had two ceiling fans put together, wired, mounted onto ceiling where there was no light before.  The work was done quickly and very well.  I highly recommend having Raceway install your ceiling fan and do any other electrical work.< /review>

I would like to say how happy I was with their service.  Mike was quick & efficient and took care of the electrical issues I was having. In the process, he found an issue with the electrical box, which he took care of also! So happy I found Raceway Electric!< /Text>

We obtained several quotes for installing a NEMA 14-50 outlet in our garage to charge our electric car. Raceway Electric was the cheapest by a considerable margin and I appreciated Mike's professionalism and expertise as he offered different options for what they could do. The service was scheduled promptly and the technician arrived right on time. Raceway Electric will be my first call if I ever have electrical needs in the future and I heartily recommended them!<//text>

<Review>Our kitchen remodel required new lighting installation and upgrades.  Raceway Electric was referred to us when the original planned electrician had a delay in keeping to our remodel calendar.  Raceway Electric came in on short notice, surveyed and rebid the project.  The upgraded lighting is fantastic.  The work crew, Billy and Sam, did a great job.
We will most definitely consider Raceway Electric to work on future lighting/electrical projects.</Review>< pictures>

We have used Raceway Electric for our solar panel installation and we are very happy. They worked closely with the roofers because we were getting a new roof, too, and that really helped make things go smoothly. We also used them recently to replace a breaker for our jacuzzi. They were punctual, courteous, and got the job done.<//Review>

Mike and crew are the best!  Sensible pricing and quality installation - all we could ask for. We use them for all electrical work now, large or small.< /text>

<review>I'm very pleased with the service from Mike at Raceway.  We had a number of old and loose wall outlets that needed attention. We also had a couple light switches that weren't connected properly so the On/Off positions were reversed. Nothing major but still out of my comfort zone. If I ever need more work done I won't hesitate to call Raceway Electric.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Raceway Electric took care of wiring up a remodel for us recently. They showed up on time, took the appropriate amount of time to troubleshoot the existing issues and after laying everything out so it wouldn't interfere with any of the other work going on, wired everything up. Their worker was knowledgeable and moved proficiently through the work space. They left the site clean and ready for the next stage. I will be using them again in the near future on more projects.<//Review>< Rate>

<Review>Can’t say enough about Raceway. After getting a tankless water heater installed I needed to move an outlet. I call Raceway and set up an appointment. Mike showed up and not only installed a new outlet he realized my garage refrigerator was plugged into a faulty gfi outlet and switched that out also. Mike was on time and extremely friendly. I highly recommend Raceway for any of your electrical needs.</Review>< Pics>

We set an appt to have the outlets installed.  2 guys came over and on time.  They did it in less than 2 hours.  We are very pleased.  We are able to hang the string of lights.  My courtyard is nicely lit now.  Will definitely call them again if we need more work done.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>This is the second time we've contracted with Mike and his team at Raceway. After our kitchen was done, we decided to get some lighting in our living room. Living in San Carlos, our home was built in the 50's and had no attic space. Thankfully Raceway was able to install our lights with minimal drywall work to be done. We are very pleased with the outcome and the service we've had with Raceway.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Billy did in 1.5 hours a job that a previous electrician couldn't do in 3 hours. Have been using them off and on for 9 years and they are reasonable and reliable.</Review>

Very professional! Mike came and gave us an estimate. He was very patient while we change our minds probably too many times. His office staff is also super accommodating! Can’t say enough good things! Lights look great and the house was clean of all debris when he left. The estimate was the price we paid, no changes or overages! Thanks!<//Text>

We had Raceway out to make a repair on a rental property we own. Quick response, good service, and a reasonable price.

Mike also inspected the panel and made a few other good, reasonable (i.e. HONEST) recommendations. With the liability involved in owning rental properties, we appreciate that a little preventative maintenance will save us a ton of time/money/headache, rather than waiting until a tenant has another problem!<//Text>

Closing time is 5pm, not 4 or 4:30 on google maps

Fresh, the fish are not small at all, very filling  with lettuce sour cream and pico on top.
Ask for side of lemon or hot sauce.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMc64GIfK_AbLp2Q73VWU1pwnl4KR58yieFUUf6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvdoX_uLCK8G-c80mWFiKmboaYlNRFqeHcdtFo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0-Tx9Vw6W8TC3RvbLps4WbEJNsXSGAuuA7aQF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5t4JyaFFv93YF3pJrCKpf9-Wrk9sxywmJt8QO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeqYw4k8kfhZ8w08GF6VcsTb9lOUVVoQl8bPHW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNI30Ppro0FoWIjPB3SXRkQnaEW2Ih_LkfAauu4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzmAUP0Vv2cxMHdJGpeXdkfxWR9f6kM2y87IOy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Response>

<rate>4< /rate><time>1581100042850</time><Review>Place is fine. I'm baffled by all the hate of the recent reviews. One person gave it one star because inflation raised the taco price? One star because taco price increase. Nevermind they liked the food? Bad review methodology. In any event. The food is great here. Standard Mexican flare. The service is mediocre because you are expected to get your plates. That's not terrible. That the type here. Nice place to eat. Plenty of chairs and tables for the size. Good place.</Review><user>102167758742617857617<//user></record>

I used to like coming  here because  they had $0.75 tacos  on Mondays. They've  since raised the price  to $0.99. Seventy-five cent tacos was worth coming  and dealing  with the mediocre customer  service.  I'm  afraid  that will no longer be  the case. Their sign reads "Fantastic Mexican  Fast Food "...Fantastic they are not.

Update: looks like $0.75 are back, I won't be. I suppose this place is alright  if you don't  know any better.  I'm  extra picky when it comes to Mexican food.  This place is horrid.<//text>

TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

We stopping in tonight to pick up dinner and from the start the woman who helped seemed annoyed that we were even there. Like we were inconveniencing her by making her do her job.  We waiting for our food and brought it home.  When we sat down to eat we discovered that our entire order was wrong.  I called to speak with a manager and ended up speaking with the same rude woman who helped us in the restaurant.  She was rude (again), disrespectful, completely unprofessional and unwilling to accept any responsibility for our order (literally every item we ordered) being incorrect.  She was argumentative and practically yelling at us on the phone.  It was insane...unbelievable!

Customer service at this place is generally not great but we’ve always overlooked it because the food is pretty good and it’s convenient for us.   Well, never again.  Tonight was beyond anything we’ve experienced there in the past.  We’ll never be back.

This woman had no business working in the customer service industry.  If she treats other customers the way she treated us, she is definitely not good for this business.< /review>

<Review>The food variety was great. Tasted better than most other Mexican restaurants. They did not serve certain items because they ran out and it was only middle of the day. My only real complaint would be that it is "Cash Only". They have an ATM machine inside but who likes to pay extra fees?< /Review>< pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Good home style Mexican food at reasonable prices. The ceviche is my favorite, yum. Refreshing light meal on these warmer days. The soups take me back in time to when I cooked with my Grandmother - it’s nice when a restaurant can bring pleasant memories to mind. My kids can’t get enough of the burritos here - enough to satisfy a teenagers appetite = SOLD! Give this place a chance, keep in mind it’s a small operation...there will be times when it’s slow. I suggest going at off peak hours, it’ll make a better experience for you.< /review>< pictures>

Really good carne asada tacos. Ask for the salsa verde! Fast service and now they take credit cards & Apple Pay. Use to be cash only for decades which was a pain. The refried beans lack a little flavor, need adjustment. Easy parking. Monday after 4pm tacos are 99cents!<//text>

<Review>A small corner restaurant on Garfield ave.
I have been here a few times and they offer good tacos and burittos. They have specials Fish Taco cada Martes y Domingo. Service was moderately fast and prices were fair and competitive. Indoor seats have a max capacity of 22 seats. Staff was nice, competent and professional. Parking is small. Overall, its a good little Mexican  restaurant.< /Review><response>None< /response><time>1567027653285< /time></record>

Update: They now have the ability to accept debit/credit cards!!!
The only drawback to this place, if one would consider it to be, (I didn't) is that it's a cash only establishment. The food servings are very large, and the food itself is amazing. I eat here as often as Im able.</text>

If I could give them no stars I would to give them a review The Woman has poor customer service skills actually no customer service skills whatsoever I ask for no salsa on my tacos and the woman refuses to she denies the fact that I even said no salsa she is rude and I ask to speak to the supervisor to a manager and she me there is no supervisor on duty there is no manager and for me to call back in the morning if I want a refund. And i will. And I'm not complaining just to complain it's because I have a medical condition that does not allow me to eat salsa and if I do I have very harsh stomach pains I have ulcers I have gallstones and every time I eat any type of spicy food it hurts my stomach but I love to eat tacos so I don't think I should have to deny myself tacos because this woman will not take the salsa out of the tacos and because she won't admit to her own fault<//text>

Most amazing staff. The food is great, my wife loves the corn cup. There carne asada is great. Everything is made to order, so it takes a little longer, but worth the wait. The prices are worth it</Text>

We get it, your staff is lazy but don't be lying to your customers just because you want to close up shop early. Food is flavorful though, that's why they get 2 stars.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c52f84cdf17f:0x3a65f2d280127737<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The food is great and quick and the people there are always willing to give you a smile.  The decor is a bit cheesy but to be honest it sometimes makes the experience that much more awesome.  If you are looking for a quick bite of Mexican with a friend or two I suggest this place.</Text>

<Text>Ordered cocido. Not sure what took so long. Usually in the pot all day and it just has to ladled out. Then the cashier didn't hear my order correct ordered taquitos with quacamole and I got side of quacamole no taquitos. She said she heard a side only. Cocido was good. If you're in a hurry or have limited meal time on a work break don't go here.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c52f84cdf17f:0x3a65f2d280127737</Gmap_id></record>

Personally had the chille verde, was not impressed. It was too soupy and had too many large chunks of Bell pepper and onion. It did not have enough meat. Would not have minded the soupiness but the portions of rice and beans were too small. I'll maybe just stick to their cheap taco night.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Their taco specials are seemingly unbeatable in the SGV and possibly beyond. Authentic food, restaurant quality. Difficult to justify going elsewhere on a Tuesday or Sunday. Buy a bag full. The complaints here are unwarranted, ignore the haters: best food in Alhambra.<//text>

<Review>I have been going to this place for years for their Monday night taco special. I always ask for the mild salsa on the side. Tonight they put the salsa on them. The guy who took my order says to me you always change order.  I have never changed my order only the number of tacos ordered with the mild salsa on the side which I requested this time. Don't treat your repeat customers this way. Admit you made a mistake and apologize.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Worst place to go!!! Very very rude service. I definitely would not recommend this place at all. They might have low prices and specials at times but definitely not worth the rude service!!! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻🖕🏻</Review>

<GmapID>0x80c2c52f84cdf17f:0x3a65f2d280127737<//GmapID><review>I always feel sick after eating their food, usually indigestion and horrible gas. It's not just me either, everyone I know who's tried them also gets sick. My dad and brother first told me not to eat here at least 15 years ago and I thought I'd give them a chance anyway. I've tried them multiple times over the past few months, at different times of day and different days of the week. I've gone mainly out of convenience, overlooking the fact that it's way overpriced and tasteless. Their champurrado is watery and overpriced too. Never again.</review>< Time>

Here I am waiting for this place to open up when the sing on the door says "open at 7:30" on Saturday, it's already 8:00 .
What really gets me is that this guy parked next to me uploading stuff for the restaurant and didn't say anything to me like can you wait we'll be open soon.
Nope nothing.< /Review>

I get CRAVINGS for their hard shell carnitas taco! When ordered after 4p, it comes stuffed with meat & so much cheese, tomatoes, lettuce & chips in the little to go box that you cant see the taco under it! All this & they include a small bag of extra chips for only $2.18 including tax 😀 The only reason they lose a star is for the "cash only".<//text>

(Translated by Google) They are my first purchases in this place. The taquitos are too small and they don't have enough vegetables they are the size of my clenched fist I paid 32.00 and I was left hungry. 6 taquitos were nothing in other places for that price they are great, if you think about misery you do not attract the customer

(Original)
Son mis primeras compras en este lugar. Los taquitos son demasiado chicos y no tienen suficiente verdura son del tamaño de mi puño cerrado pague 32.00 y me quede con hambre. 6 taquitos fueron nada en otros lugares por ese precio son grandes, si se piensa en miseria no se atrae al cliente<//Review>

< Review>
The staff was very friendly and customer service was great. We called ahead to make sure the equipment  that we needed was available and the gentleman on the phone said that he would reserve it for us since it was the last one in the store. When I arrived he remembered me from the phone and said he was was waiting for me to get there. I though that was nice and his co-worker assisted me with finding some other things that I needed. It was my first time at this location, but I will definitely come back in the future.< /Review>

Sam Ash in CP has a great selection of both new and used; and the prices are always fair.  Bob in the repair shop in the back is also worth noting; super cool cat and a wealth of knowledge. I've bought many things here over the years; amps, pedals, a bass, strings, repairs.  I love the layout of the store and the employees are consistently good.<//review><Resp>{'time': 1577828789237, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, Phillip!

The store is stocked! Which I miss pre Covid and everyone seems to truly want to help you not just make the sale. Which we all need to make the sale. So I'm fine with very helpfully aggressive salesmen. This guy was extremely calm and non pushy, which was very nice.<//review>

Went to buy new strings for my Tenor Kala ukulele and my Alvarez concert  50th anniversary Greatful Dead edition ukulele, not seeing strings specifically for a tenor I guessed the concert strings would be fine, lucky for me, David let me know there are strings specifically for a tenor ukulele, though he didn’t have them In stock he called another store and they will mail them to me. Great  service. Thanks David.</review>

< Review>
first time going to a sam ash, heard great things about it. so i took my amp there to seek what was wrong with it and the dude with the long hair spent a good ten minutes talking down on me for not knowing enough about the amp (which is why i went to begin with) all for him to tell me to go to a different store since he apparently didnt know much about amps either lol. i never review but this had to be the worst interaction ive had in a music store, i'm pretty patient with people but it was one smart comment away from turning into an argument<//Review>

<Text>The guys at Sam Ash in Canoga Park are awesome! Mark in the guitar department is the best. Mark is super knowledgeable and extremely helpful. I didn't know what to expect walking into this store and from the moment I walked in I felt very comfortable. It's tough times these days and at least for the time I spend in the store Anthony and his team make me feel at home!< /Text>< name>

Cleaning out my storage locker and brought in some used drum gear. They gave me a very fair price for everything, cashed me out, and I ended up finding a stickbag, and used some of that cash to pay for it.< /review>

...nice enough employees however I always find the inventory a little too dusty and the employees lacking any sort of energy.  I’ve met the Manager who seems to get customer service however the rest seem a little too sleepy.< /Review>

<text>I would like to give them 5 stars, but there was an unfortunate hiccup. I purchased an open box item, and it seems the power supply adaptor was misplaced. I contacted Sam Ash, and they were able to help me rectify the issue in a friendly, courteous, and professional manner.

I have since been able to test the item and it works flawlessly. I very happy with my purchase, and will not hesitate to purchase from Sam Ash again.

As a first time customer I am very impressed, and I will be sure to check them out the next time I'm looking to purchase an item. I would hlike to give 5 stars, but the transaction wasn't "perfect." As someone who used to work in retail I understand that this happens. It's how you handle the issues that arise that makes you such a good company.<//text>< user_id>

With all the online merchandise available these days, it was SO refreshing to have Loris assist me in the purchase of a bass amplifier, and bass accessories. I won’t have to “send it back,” because I got to try, hear, and compare everything in the store, I have exactly what I was looking for, and at home, it’s all perfect. Loris is a super sharp, knowledgeable guy with a lot of musical expertise, so go see him in the bass department!! He should run the whole store!!

< Review>
I have to say Christopher was beyond amazing! He made my whole shopping experience great! Talk about going above and beyond, I was a bit stressed about trying to find and buy the right violin for my daughter, but when I spoke with Christopher not only did he helped me with all my questions and concerns about picking the right one he also did an amazing job at helping my daughter to find the right violin that will be the best fit for her, his patients and knowledge is beyond amazing, I highly recommend Sam Ash to anyone who is looking for anything related to music, and if your looking for a string instrument then I definitely recommend to go speak with Christopher! I will definitely be coming back when I need anything for my daughter's violin.< /Review>

I bought a Digitech iPB10 from them on ebay.  It works fine!  The listing stated that it was missing two rubber pads on the foot pedal, but I bought it anyway.  What was also missing, but not stated in the listing were the following:  1) the original box; 2) the original power supply (a Line 6 one was substituted and works fine); 3) the product manual; and 4) the rubber insert that enables the unit to be used with a thinner, second generation iPad.  It was packed well in a "ton" of bubble wrap and shipped promptly following payment.  I would do business with them again as the item works flawlessly.  The 4 reasons stated above are why I cannot provide a 5 star rating, but again, all is well with the functionality of the unit.< /Text>

Mark helped us with my daughter's first guitar that she bought for herself.  He was incredibly helpful,  knowledgeable, and super honest about all the items we looked at/talked about.  We even brought in our amp from home and he explained all the controls to us in full detail.  It was a great experience,  super happy!<//text>

The gentleman who helped me pick out a suitable starter guitar for my 4 year old granddaughter, was funny, knowledgable, and candid.  I value those things in all people, and look forward to returning to the Canoga Park store in the not too distant future to shop again - and laugh with him again.  I'm sorry I cannot recall his first name, and it was not on the receipt, but he was in the guitar section on Nov 26, 2019.  Great guy.  Can't thank him enough for just being himself - made it a more fun shopping experience for me for sure!  Thanks again-</Text>

On my first trip, all the employees were very nice and helpful as I wanted to play at least 4 different guitars that day. I was able to take my time and relax. I fell in love with one of the 2019 Les Paul Standard’s they had and a few days later came back to purchase it after shopping around at various locations. Thanks to Hedras, I had a nice suede guitar strap and a set of Ernie Ball strings thrown in for free with my guitar purchase!!! Will certainly purchase from them again! 10/10<//Text>

Welp, I haven't done business with them for a while and I thought I'd stop by to shop for some picks and just get a feel. The guy in the guitar department wasn't friendly and not very helpful, Luckily somebody from another department helped me check out and saved the day.

<Review>This store is a very nice addition to our declining neighborhood, the staff are nice too. A very nice selection of musical instruments. Just my opinion, the Used/Pre-Owned items are overpriced and I am NOT hating. Just saying, there is no shortage of guitars/basses/drums.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1569023430715, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your kind words, Franki!

My 11 year old call and asked about an item he wanted and from the start the guy was professional. When we got to the store the guy went beyond on helping us to get the item we wanted and a few other things to go with it. Really helpful and totally a true professional all the time being so down to earth.< /Review>

This store is super clean and the people working there are very friendly.  Every time i need a new book for my kids piano classes,  this is where i go.  One time they didn't have the new theory book that my daughter needed and the guy there ordered it online and shipped it to my house. I got it within 3 days without having to make an extra trip.  That was super helpful.  Wonderful store.  I've been coming here for about 2 yrs, since my daughter started her piano classes (when she was 4).  Definitely recommend it!< /Review>

<review>I received the best customer service from Sam Ash. My recently purchased guitar had a defective tuning machine & I contacted my sales rep who set up a visit at my local store. The Luthier did a fantastic job of not only swapping out  the defective tuning machine, but did a complete set up & evaluation on my guitar out of courtesy. I could not be happier & will be bringing more of my business to Sam Ash.

The staff was very helpful. Always fun going in to browse what goodies they have. The one problem - a faulty guitar tuner they replaced it on the spot. They've always been willing to order what they don't have in the store. Their knowledgeable staff helped guide me through all the dizzying guitar stuff as I was learning. Always pleasant.<//text>

The only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars is because they were short staffed on a Saturday afternoon.  Although the person helping me was really nice and he was trying really hard to take care of all of us.  I don't remember his name but I think that he lives or lived in Torrance .<//text>

What a great experience!! I got great trade in value from the GM for my gear that I was able to put towards an amazing vintage MusicMan bass. The sales man Loris is my go to guy. He’s very knowledgeable and really made me feel comfortable about my last purchase of a Line 6 Helix. In fact he liked mine so much that he bought one for himself to replace all of his pedals. He couldn’t believe that he had waited so long to get one for himself.< /review>

Although we had to wait a little bit longer than normal, they repaired my son's sax and it sounds "very sweet" according to him.  He is very happy with the sound and the repair cost was minimal compared to what other repair shops wanted to charge me.  The repair person did call me to update me on the discovery of the extent of the damage and what the cost would be, plus she explained the reason of the delay.  This isn't a problem for us, because this sax is a backup for my son and not his primary instrument...however, now this "backup" sounds better than his primary instrument and will now be played much more often.  Thank you Sam Ash for quality service and the fine communication.<//Review>

< Review>
Awesome service! Cool instruments. I was looking for my first electric guitar in other music stores and I was very indecisive of what to buy. Nobody helped me choose like Loris did at this shop. He is very knowelgable and knows what he talks about. Walked out of the store with the perfect guitar. At first I wasn't really sure even as I was buying it at this store because I was looking at so many other guitars but once I got home and checked out my new guitar on my own time I was very pleased. Shout out to Loris. Thanks man</Review>

<Review>Love this store. Sales help is friendly and excellent. Selection is good and you can't beat their return policy. Yes, you'll pay a little more than you would online, but for no hassle shopping, the trade-off is worth it. I've bought two bass guitars, a bass amp, one drum kit, cymbals, sticks, drum heads and sheet music from this very store.< /Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Great place to find every musical instrument you may be looking for. Great customer service.  Music instructors are very knowledgeable. They even have jam nights for students. My son lives for Sam Ash, if he could go there everyday he would.< /review>

I was attempting to trade some used gear, which included several well made (hand crafted in the USA) and in good condition acoustic guitars and a banjo. I was welcomed at the door of Sam Ash; a young man named Christian helped me haul my trade items to the proper section of the store and Chris Breedlove was extremely helpful, friendly, patient and fair with me. We were able to strike a deal. I also found the quality of the guitars in stock, especially the acoustic instruments, both new and used, to be superior to GC. Customer friendly, knowledgeable, professional, excellent selection. I have been buying, selling and trading musical equipment for 40 years.

Great service, always quick and fast, and most importantly, he's a good guy, friendly man.
Ive taken my guitars to a lot of guys, all over the Valley, and Bob is absolutely the best.

It was what I expected.
There isn't as much sheet music because people are purchasing online.  There weren't as many staff members because traffic has slowed somewhat.  Love the open mic Wednesday nights.<//text>

DO NOT SHOP HERE! I came to the store to return an amplifier and receieved the WORST service by an employee named MARK! I tried to renturned it to the prick and he threw a tantrum right in the middle of the store! The employee shouted at me, made a scene, and did nothing but give me a bad attitude the whole time i was there. I will NEVER shop there ever again. If you do enter the store, avoid MARK. He is the most miserable excuse for an employee I have ever encountered there! He is a washed-up muscian who NEVER made it and is now stuck working there so he takes it out on customers! I will NEVER return! Again, AVOID THIS STORE!!!< /text>

Standard music shop, with friendly staff.

My only complaint is that there wasn't enough staff around to help. When I got there, no one was in the band section to answer questions.<//review>

Customer service at this store isn't very good. There are only like 3 customers in the store and I still can't get any help. They need more employees.</review>

I love the sales folks here. So friendly and helpful. They want you leave the store happy! No pressure and we must have played 10 guitars in the 2hrs we were there. Bought two guitars and going back for a 3rd next month. You can never have too many guitars!😁</review>

We were fortunate enough to have an amazing meal. The food was exceptional and the service was absolutely perfect. The photos do not do this meal Justice. The steak was cooked to perfection and worth every penny. We will be back very soon!</text>

This is a Fabulous location!! We ate outside with the Capitol in the background. The sun was setting and the patio was draped in twinkle lights. You will not find a better view downtown, Anywhere! 5 stars for ambiance/location. The waiter we had was lovely! 5 stars for him, too. I really wanted to love the duck but it was Well Done instead of Medium. The cherry demi glace seemed to be more like melted Cherry Jam. In their defense, I know it takes some time to work out the kinks when opening a new restaurant. Our waiter made sure we were taken care of when all was said and done. (I told you he was good!) We'll give them some time to become a well-oiled machine before we go back.<//Text>

Great location, just across the street from the Capital. I only stopped in for a beer but the food menu looked delicious. Great atmosphere and staff, beautiful clam shaped antique lounge chairs. I'll definitely be back to try the food.<//Text>

<Review>I have been coming to Izzy's for many years now and things have definitely changed quite a bit as far as food quality goes. The interior is the same as it was over a decade ago, the service was swift, attentive and the server was knowledgeable.

The food is not exactly like it used to be but it was still very good.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Text>We decided on this restaurant impromptu for dinner and what a great decision it was. The service is amazing, and the restaurant is beautiful! The food, while pricey, was amazing. I had the filet steak and the meat was divine. The steak was also cooked to perfection. The Chef de Cuisine came to our table to inquire about our satisfaction with the food, which made us feel appreciated. Again, pricey, but so worth it!!!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Immaculately clean and well-maintained. Service was fine. Ordered the Fried Avacado burger (great!) and the Inferno Burger (just okay, not as spicy as the name would make it out to be.) Parmesan fries were great.

A little pricey for what was received, but would still recommend and return.</text><gmap_id>0x809ad1284a9b5f3d:0xe8d6ca42b80e4d54< /gmap_id><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<review>Disappointing at best... bar was out of ingredients for their signature drink.. and straw hardly reach to the rim of the glass.. wait it gets worse... mussels should not have left the kitchen, dried out shells with nothing in them to eat. The Filet Mignon was served on a plate in a lake of water, I guess it might have been in a microwave oven or came straight from a freezer to a Luke warm pan.. the server was very polite about it all and offered not to charge for the plates we send back in addition to offering a free dessert, we politely declined the offer and went home for some bread and cheese... not coming back..</review>< pics>

<Review>Tried this new place for happy hour. Very nice looking and clean. Upscale. Had a special of 3 oysters half shell plus glad of champagne for $10. Champagne was good and oysters were small. For the price I  expect small so no issue there. The taste was very good. Unfortunately the service is very poor or this place was headed for 5 stars. Long wait before greet on arrival even though not busy. Very long wait for the oysters. The real deal killer was done with drink and food but sitting being ignored for extended time in not so busy place. Instead of ordering more as planned I left and went to another happy hour nearby.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Great location for lunch during the Tour of California race. We enjoyed the patio area. My boyfriend enjoyed the salmon and a beer.  I had a ceasar salad..which was disappointing.  It was a hot day and the romaine was put on the grill which caused the romaine lettuce to wilt. Warm wilt salad on a hot day was not great.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Nice atmosphere, food was OK, but the service was very slow. It took 40 min. to get our lunch which doesn't work when you take an hour for lunch. It took another 20 min. to bring back my credit card so I could leave. I can't imagine a restaurant that runs out of french fries at 11:30 am. which tells me they are not very organized.</review>

I heard a lot of good about this place for steak chops etc. So when my Tom Hawkstake was overly cooked. I took two bits and I was disappointed I order my steak Medium and no pink in my steak taste less for my palate. Sorry for 1 star but it is to the Chef who cooked my steak 👎😔🥩
I would of told them about it but I was hungry and for them to cook a New! steak I would have fainted I waited all day to save myself for dinner.<//text>

To the owner: google maps appears to be glitching - when I got directions to your restaurant it automatically rated you the original flat 3 stars with no additional info. I did not do this, as I never leave blank reviews! Sorry about that though. Definitely was a 5 star visit.</text>< username>

We were lucky enough to schedule a reservation on a night that wasnt very busy during our first day visiting Sacramento. The food was phenomenal and we had the entire back room to ourselves (the decor was lovely as well!)! Steaks were well prepared with good trimming and the duck and risotto plate was well executed with great flavor pairings. The drink we ordered was prepared a bit too strong, but overall I have only praise for this little location.< /text>

Brett was our server and bar tender and his service was above and beyond. We came here especially for the Tomahawk steaks and I can say that they definitely delivered! These steaks were awesome.  They were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. We also ordered the chicken and pork chops which were huge portions and tasted soooo delicious! He can also me a great drink forsure 😉 Overall we had a awesome experience at the restaurant and definitely will be coming back again! Thank you Brett for your hospitality and patience with us,  the family from Chihuahua Mexico!</text>

Had dinner at the Diplomat on Sunday Sept 2. Reviews were amazing, reservation was at 615. It took 15 minutes to get water, another 10minutes to get drinks. The place didn’t have 12 customers in there. Wanted Prime RibEye out. We asked about desserts and they had 2 items to order. So we ordered Fillets and they came out with cool plates. Side dishes were potatoes and they were luke warm. Not what we were expecting. Gotta do better then that.<//review>

We like to try restaurants that are new to us, so on Saturday night before the Philharmonic concert my husband and I took advantage of the special $35 per person Dine Downtown menu. The decor is beautiful, elegant, & soothing.  We spent $40 on 4 glasses of a Rhone blend red wine that we enjoyed. The service and food were all good, but the portions were comically tiny. While the starter salads were of normal size, my salmon entree was 3 ounces at most.  His bacon wrapped filet couldn't have been more than 4 ounces and was accompanied by 2 potatoes the size of grape tomatoes.  The dessert eclairs were the size of my pinky finger.  Their regular menu is much higher priced, so I would hope those portions would be larger as well.</Text>

An unbelievably amazing fine dining experience  from start to finish. From walking through the door and being greeted by the lovely hostess felt like being welcomed into the restaurant as if we were family. After being sat down the waiter was immediately spot on, accompanied by his busser, provided high class service. The food quality was exceptionally high, after finding out an Allen bros butchery based in Chicago was providing the wet aged tomahawk I ordered, I was hooked. My steak was amazing, flawlessly amazing. I believe the best thing in my experience was the desserts. I tried the very decadent molten lava cake served with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream and a very rich bruleé cheese cake finished with a berry sauce and mixed berries. I will admit I will be coming back soon.< /Text>

< review>
It was Dine Downtown and nice restaurants put their best foot forward for $35 for a 3 course dinner. We were seated and their was an extra napkin under the table. I ordered the Lobster Bisque, Bacon wrapped filet, and eclair for dessert. The Lobster Bisque tasted like tomato soup and drawn butter, not lobster bisque. The bacon wrapped filet was stuffed wit a spear of asparagus and wrapped with bacon. It was the size of my thumb. The meat was tough and the three marble sized potatoes that came with it tasted best. Dessert was half of what appeared to be a stale leclair. I cant speak well of the service as well. The male waiter could use deoderant. Overall, one of the worst meals I have ever had.< /review>

<Text>Best ribeye I’ve had in the Sacramento area. It’s a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. Service was outstanding. We walked in before a broadway show, lookin like some podunk rednecks, got a few stares lol didn’t realize how formal this place was. I had the ribeye medium rare, cooked to perfection. My wife had the New York cut medium well (I know I know, what is she thinking, I still don’t know after 8 years together) it looked and smelled wonderful and by the look on her face and from what she told me was a great piece of meat. Au Graten potatoes are a must order. The drinks, don’t even get me started on the drinks. Mixed and poured from angels!

All in all if your looking for a wonderful steak, this is the place. Looking to take her somewhere special, dress her up and tote her around like a queen, (did I mention they gave us complimentary champagne) this is the place. Word of the wise, it did look pretty formal, looking back I think we should of dressed a little better. We will be back next time we’re back down south.</Text>< gmap_id>

Thye wax is smooth and not sticky AT ALL. They clean and prep very diligently and are very accommodating for issues. The only reason for the 4 stars is for the front reception team. They need more training. Seems that almost every time we are there they can't figure out something with the system for payments. Also not a fan of the late policy. That really should be adjusted.  If the guest ahead of you is 15 minutes late but you are on time, they will take the late person first therefore making you wait much much longer than you should. If that happens again i will go elsewhere. My time is scheduled for me not waiting on someone else. If you're late then you should be made to wait. Please change this policy.< /review><response>{'time': 1613998751306, 'text': "Hi there. We appreciate you taking the time to leave us feedback.

They do a pretty good job here but they get people in and out as fast as possible. Some of the girls really do a good job and offer you highlighter for your brows or fill them in for you when you leave but some offer nothing... that treatment should be standard.<//text>

I am giving it 4 stars because their customer service was great, even tho I was late, they didnt press me and took care of me ASAP. However, as much as I have been there before their wax I dont like it so much. They cant pull past.  They do it  by sections and not do a swift pull or else the wax break apart. This is not cool when you are doing a brazilian. I will for sure come back for my under arms.</text>

<Text>Mary is hands down the best aesthetician I have ever had! I have had over a dozen in my years of being waxed. She is kind, gentle and so great at what she does. She greets me by my first name and always remembers my wants and always makes sure I am happy and comfortable. I have bought the unlimited pass three years in a row just because of her services. She always makes me look and feel like a million bucks! The Bella Terra location is my favorite because the front desk girls are always so sweet and always remember me. Thanks for the great customer service!</Text></record>

Such a wonderful experience! I had same day engagement pictures and the staff was so accommodating! I needed an eyebrow and lip wax; since it was my first visit, my eyebrows were complimentary! The wax specialist sculpted my brows to my face shape and showed me how to align my brows with my bone structure, which no one has bothered to do before! I’m one happy customer!< /text>

Waxing can and most likely will give you ingrown hairs. When the wax pulls your hairs your hairs can sometimes break off, allowing your skin to cover the hair and create an ingrown hair. They are so painful and are not easily to get rid of. Unless you are doing small areas for touch up, I do not recommend. Lazer is way more clean and easy, also long lasting. Waxing does not make the hairs go away for ever, just temporary.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Nicole has been my waxer for abut a year now or more. I love her. My friend and i have 7 children between us so we always make appointments one after the other so we can watch each other's kids. The girls at the front desk are always so sweet to our kids. They always remember us and check us right in. The girls often come out and talk to all the kids. The receptionists are always willing to help accommodate my friend and I needing appointments together. I love this place. If you've never been here before, you get a free wax, or half off a more expensive wax. Try it, you'll love it. They also offer unlimited waxing for a year or buy so many of a particular wax, get so many free. Makes the wax even cheaper.< /Review>

I’ve been waxing here for over a year now and I usually have a wonderful relaxing 😌 time. Grace is awesome. But I did not get to have Grace one time and the girl I had did an ok job. It was so much more painful than with Grace. Then she said she had her own home business waxing and tried to get me to come there. I found this very unprofessional and rude. She also just decided on her own that my upper lip needed to be waxed and just did it. I have little to no hair on my face. When I left I was so mad and did inform the front staff and they took care of it. I still love love ❤️ this place and the after care products are amazing 😉. Thank you 😊 for your kindness especially to Grace. I love 💗 her !!</Review>

<review>What a relief to have finally found a consistent place for my beauty needs! I have consistently every month for years now and European Wax Center always provides great professional service. I know I will always be taken care by whomever I set an appointment with. This company truly takes care to produce consistently professional estheticians. The only drawback is that their App is currently only available on Apple. Still, phoning in for appointment corrections have always been easy and quick.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

This review is for Mary only. Amazing brow artist. She books up really fast and for a few weeks at a time so I usually go online to book if she has any cancellations.< /Text>

I called from inside a salon, so understandably there was background noise; the person on the line said they couldn’t hear me so I stepped outside and asked if it was any better. The amount of sarcasm and irritation in the tone of her voice instantly changed my mind! Customer service is number one, and there is absolutely no excuse for the lack of professionalism. Please train the staff here to do their job and at least pretend they would like clients.< /review>

The salon is clean and neat but .. the front office girls are always trying to help 5 people at once and they never answer their phone UGH!

Worst place ever! I have never been to a place where my wife and I have treated like we were Poor white trash at a Middle-class mall. Treated my wife horribly! This set up a appointment and then told us that the appointment was not at that time that it was at another time and that they were unable to help us and that we would have to come back in  a  3 1/2 hours. Extremely rude extremely unorganized extremely overpriced. My wife was look down upon because of the way she was dressed walking in by all the stuck up snobby want to be rich people that worked there. Avoid this place at all costs.< /Text>

<review>We've been there 3-4 times now and the food is mostly 4/5 star, but what gives them a 3 is mostly service.  On our last trip we got fajitas and the beans and rice was brought 15-20 minutes before the meat leaving them cold by meal time.  Hard to get checked on after served your food and tables stay dirty far too long for the mildctraffic they had those days.  We hope service improves.<//review>< pictures>

Excellent mexican food, a bit of a surprise tucked in this corner of the state. Salsa was fresh, chips tasty and all 4 of our meals were excellent. Husband loves Chile Colorado and it’s not that easy to find.
Also has patio dining.<//Review>

Great Mexican food in the middle of logging country! Was recommended this place by the Burney area Facebook group. The Chile Colorado burrito and spicy salsa (you have to ask for it) makes this place a yearly visit for me. Super friendly staff.<//Review>

Best Mexican food I've had since I moved from San Diego.  If you're in the area, this is the place to go.  Both my wife and I cannot stop extolling the quality of the food as well as the preparation.

If you want Mexican food, come here.  Better than anything as far as Redding etc.....< /review>

< Review>
Out exploring the mountains around Mt Shasta and got hungry.   Stopped into Ortega's based on lack of options and good reviews.  As many Mexican restaurants go this is a family run business.   It is small and cozy and the servers are friendly and polite. Chips and salsa were very good,  with the chips being light and crispy.   Tried the Chicken chimichanga based on others reviews and found it to be good.... not great but good.

The amazing dish was the fried ice  cream.... I have tried many and most taste stale like they were made yesterday.    This was fresh and crispy like it was made to order.... I highly recommend it!  A single scoop of vanilla ice cream covered in something like crushed corn flakes then deep fried.   This is then put into a fried flour tortilla "bowl"  and the whole concoction is sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon with a dollop of whipped cream on top and drizzled with chocolate syrup!<//Review>

<Text>Excellent food. Large portions and reasonable prices. They are very friendly and the wait is not long considering the work they put into their food. The building isn't very big so it's quite crowded at regular meal times. Although there is a large covered deck out back overlooking the river in good weather. The place is very clean. Not much parking but a spot close by is usually not hard to find< /Text></record>

< review>
We went there for Ramadan iftar. The food took very long time to he ready. The menu doesn’t have many options it is mainly grilled or tagen. The food was tasty, the meet and cheese sandwich was little bit salty. The size of the meal is good. However it is overpriced. I tried other restaurants in San Diego and there is a big difference in the prices with same or better quality. All the meals are expensive they should have wider price range. The experience wasn’t bad but I don’t think will come again.<//review>

The Aladdin Cafe has a cozy diner atmosphere and a variety of classic Mediterranean dishes.   I ordered their #4 which was 2 chicken kabobs, rice, hummus, tomato, Lebanese salad and pita.  They have many different kabobs and salads to choose from as well as pickled vegetables.  Dessert options include baklava and kunafa.  You can find plenty of filling and healthy options here for yourself and family.<//Review>

You walk in and you just smell the deliciousness of this place. The service was great they knew their menu well and they made great recommendations. The salads, kebabs and boraks are amazing.

<text>The best lamb chops in town hands down. Even when everything is slow this place is busy. That's how good it is.  They have a good selection food always seems of quality and fresh. They are very friendly here.  I was a little surprised by the location since its not by very much , the parking lot can be a little crazy getting in and out of since its so small and busy. But its totally worth it. Definitely the best lamb. I love there salads too so delicious.  We eat here at least once a week luckily its close by to my kids school lol Definitely recommend this place especially since its a small mom n pop kind of place and not some chain restaurant< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Wonderful. I’m an out of towner and the meat platter is to DIE for. It can easily feed three or four people. Here are two pics,  before and after.

Three lamb medallions, kebobs, two lamb

<text>Delicious foods and large portions. Make sure you get some of the garlic sauce to eat with your food. This restaurant is particularly good for large groups since the food is designed to be shared. If you get food from the wood fire (you should), place the order right when you get to the table since it takes some time to cook (around 30-60 minutes).</text></record>

What a wonderful place! Very friendly people and the customer service is excellent! The food is even better! One of the best places I’ve visited. Will definitely go back very soon to try more items from the menu. They did a wonderful job with keeping everyone safe in the middle of the pandemic. A must try! Trust me, you’ll leave feeling satisfied!<//review>

Very good food and generous portions. The books combo was tasty. We really liked the line balls. The koufta kebeb entree was flavorful. My wife had the chicken swarrma. This place was a bit busy. Not sure if it's always this way on Saturday nights. We'll be back for sure.</Review>

I didn’t want to write this review but I am so disappointed. I work near by and we’ve ordered from here several times. The particular dish I’ve ordered now for the third time in hopes that it would be better, was not at all but in fact worse. I order the Turkish Koufta Tajine. It’s almost $20 for 16oz and takes at least 45 mins. I received just a large patty with 3 thinly sliced potatoes (one was rotten), 3 tomatoes, 3 peppers and several chunks of garlic. They have changed the recipe and don’t mention that on their website. You don’t receive anything like the picture. I called to ask for a refund and was told I would have to bring the item back in order to receive it. We won’t be ordering from here again because if you can’t take care of your repeated customers spending hundreds of dollars than I will take my business elsewhere.</Text>

Aladdin has been here as long as I can remember, and it's always been great! My family decided spur of the moment to get our dinner here tonight. We're a family of 5, plus we love leftovers, so the order was rather big. I placed the order over the phone, the receiving employee was very quick and efficient -- everything came out perfectly and SUPER tasty.

We had our Wedding Day dinner at Aladdin Mediterranean Restaurant and couldn't be happier! The food was phenomenal and the service was top notch!
Mike made sure we had everything we needed.
We felt like we were at our favorite Uncle's house for dinner.
Thank you to Mike & all of the amazing staff at Aladdin's for making our Wedding Day even more special!< /text>

<Review>Aladdin is my go-to for Greek and Mediterranean. Staff knows the menu very well if you want to ask for recommendations. Service is fast and friendly and the food is fantastic. Looks good, tastes good. They also do take out! 11/10 to Mike for being so awesome!< /Review>< rating>

A San Diego classic mediterranean restaurant. Falafel was tasty. Felt less fried/greasy than other places. Lots of options too. Prices are a bit high compared to other similar places.  But it is also a touch more upscale. Worth it for a good mediterranean fix.</Text>

The Mediterranean salad, the fresh pita bread, the beef shawarma, everything was extremely delicious and high quality! I will definitely be returning! Angie, our waitress, was very pleasant and very attentive. She gets 5-Stars too.</Review>

Very good mediterranean, the portions are huge. We had enough food to take home and I ate it for dinner 2 more days. I loved the turkish ice cream with baklava as well. The only thing they could improve is pita bread could be warmer.</review>

10 stars if I could rate that high. Incredibly welcoming staff and the owner was an absolute sweetheart. It felt fantastic to find food that was just like I used to eat in Beer Sheva, and made a hard time that much better. Tea is phenomenal and you get free refills if you buy a whole teapot. Servings are HUGE so come extremely hungry. Pita is homemade and so soft and fluffy and delicious. Will definitely be coming back< /Review>

Experienced one of the Mediterranean cuisines in San Diego. The salad, Pita, hummus and fries that I had here were really fresh and tasty. The service here was great and quick. It was my first time here. Though it’s expensive, I think they have the best quality food here. Highly recommend the Turkish ice cream with Baklava for dessert!<//review>

<Text>Sooooooooooo good omg. The kefta kebabs are to die for. I grew up in the Middle East and have been to multiple Middle Eastern restaurants across the US. Believe me when I say Aladdin does their kebabs right. So so so good.<//Text>< gmap_id>

<Review>Wonderful birthday dinner.  Dined al fresco,  and the service and food were amazing. We ordered the lamb chops and the mixed grill. Portions are huge. I have enough leftovers for lunch & dinner tomorrow.  Even the little things like the salad and pita were delicious.  Don't leave without trying the baklava!
*** One side note, the rack of lamb needs to be ordered 24 hours in advance. They should add that to their online menu.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Burn kebabs, ask waitress to change, she said no, got home after eating chicken kebabs, got stomach pain ,
I was recommended by friends to go there from Orange County drove over 60 miles to get stomach pain and they wouldn’t change the lamb chops and minced kebab, if I could give 0 stars I would,< /Text>

I usually come to this place once a month. We had the rudest service today. Her name was Katie.

The first time she came in said:
It will take me some time to get to you guys!! (with huge attitude)

Then she came in and asked: what kind of drinks you want (with an attitude). I said what kind of beer you guy carry. She replies: you know what.. I don't know... I probably repeated this 100 times today!!! (With an attitude). I grabbed my stuff and left.

You know what... if you wanna charge extra for middle easter food, you better provide a service that matches this price.< /review>

This location always,  always has absolutely amazing food!!  I didn't even want to wait to take a picture, just wanted to dig in. Best lamb kabobs EVER and my husband always gets the Mediterranean chicken salad, it's huge and tasty. Best Hummus too!  You've gotta try it!< /Review>

This is definitely my favorite Mediterranean food in the San Diego area. Their entire plates are huge (I'm a fan of the gyro), and the pizzas are really unique. For me though the highlight is definitely the hummus and baba ganoush. No where else will you find a creamier and more flavorful version of these two.<//review>

< Review>
You can’t get better Mediterranean food than this place! Everything I’ve tried here (except the falafel which is good but not amazing because it’s kinda dry) is amazing. Love the chicken schwerma entree, the pita wraps are amazing. Hummus is the best ever - so creamy and light. We’re harsh critics and we’re huge fans of this place.<//Review>

great staff - gave recommendations and offered advice on the menu.  had salad with chicken tiki and it was huge - enough for 2 meals.  only downside is the outdoor dining that came with flies but nothing they can do about that.< /text>

I absolutely love their food.  I have never been disappointed.  I usually get their Kabab plate, but I've tried many dishes here and they were all delicious.  I dont usually like lamb but theirs is delicious and I have ordered it on multiple occasions.  The staff is attentive and friendly, and I appreciate their efforts very much.</Text>

Update: new menu! I love their lamb shank. It’s the best around and it’s the best price! Their food somehow I felt for better too. No more booze tho, but you can bring in your own at no cost. The mixed combo is a must get. Their salad is the beat, get with any dish!!

Total fan of their chicken salad and their wraps. The food is good and delicious. My bf always order their salads and I always order their gyro. The food is legit! The naan and hummus is also good. Although they changed the way they cooked their naan. Which is okay, still really good. The patio is dog friendly.</text>

I have been here many times. Obviously, the food isn't as good as what you eat anywhere in mediterranean bu it is still good food. Pizzas are worth trying. Hummus and salads are always fresh. I'd expect better pita from a place that has a  fire wood oven but I'll still go ahead and recommend this place.< /Review>

It was our first time here. Excellent service and great food. Our waiter recommended a platter for two. The platter came with 5 different kinds of kebab and rice plus tasty salad. Salad was very refreshing and fresh never had it like that before. We ordered Arabian mint tea. It was awesome. I'm going to see how to make that tea at home. Very clean place and busy. Definitely worth a try to visit .<//Text>

Huge portions of really high-quality meats marinated in delicious herbs and spices!  You can feed 4 people on one of their mix plates and everyone will love their meal and leave satisfied.  I really will look forward to come back here when I'm visiting San Diego!  Highly recommended!</Text>

Ordered from this restaurant for the first time from ubereats. I was a little taken back by the price but my coworker said it’s a lot of food and it is worth it. I decided to go for it. Oh. My. Word. It is so good. It was enough food for 3 or 4 meals and was absolutely fresh and delicious. I have marked this place as a favorite and hope to visit it when the quarantine is over! Amazing!<//text>

Aladdin in Clairemont is so delicious. My husband and I ordered a spread of food. Jafar's pizza, chicken salad and the Meza platter. Everything was extremely delicious.  The place is fantastic. The staff are incredible people and friendly.</text>

<Text>After seeing ads on YouTube, I had to try this restaurant out. It is worth the 2 hr drive from Imperial Valley. The atmosphere, the aromas, the music, and the personalities are a great mix and pleasant. Mike, my waiter, is attentive and friendly. I shall return to experience more. I am hoping that there would be live music and belly dancing there. I ask "you", please bring it there for the (full) Mediterranean experience.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

My first visit here.  I love lamb, and the server suggested a dish of 2 lamb chops, 2 chicken and 1 beef kabob, and a dinner salad.  The price above the dinner she suggested was $19.50.  For me, that's a very expensive lunch, but it sounded special.  It was good.  When the tab came, it was $34.50!  I wouldn't spend that much for a good dinner!  When I questioned it, she said that selection she described wasn't the $19.50 selection, but a selection further up the menu.  As I said, I would never have spent $34.50 on lunch no matter how good it sounded.  It may have been an honest mistake, but for someone not familiar with the menu, I think some kind of discount should have been offered.<//review>

I visited this place couple of times.
I am really surprised to see the fluctuations of consistency.
Recently, I visited the place for dinner with my friends who were travelling from other states.

We ordered the three mixed grill plate  and somehow one of the "Chicken Keema Kebabs" was smelly and stale. We informed our server and she discussed the same with the Chef/Cook. Later the waitresses explained the one of Kebab skewers was free and if I want, I can remove from my plate.

Both Chef and the Waitress ignored the main issue about bad food and asked us to eat remaining They should not have served that kebab in the first place no matter whether its free or not.

Note that, as I tried this place 3-4 times already; chicken Keema kebab always been served int he mixed grill platter. All the explanation was worthless and shocking to see the un-professionalism.<//review>

Chicken Shawarma get in my mouth!! So been here a couple times and it is awesome. Great wait staff. Outside seating so you can hang out with your friends or family at the end of the world. Need a mask to go inside but outside is like face freedom central. Wait we still do that?.....yes we do friend. The garlicky mouthgazm that is in the chicken shawarma sandwich is a gift from the food gods. I would for sure recommend eating a ladle full. Big portions, fresh hummus, and just down right yum.<//Text>

< review>
I just had dinner with my husband and two couples of friends in Aladdin, and went through a horrible experience. I visited the restaurant many times before, since the food is good. But after what I went through today, I will never return to the place. We ordered a descent amount of food, which was all good. But then the waitress mistakenly brought out two portions of Mawashi, (despite the fact that we ordered only one) and the meat in it was raw. We immediately requested to return the dish, and then a young kid named Ali said the chef checked the Mawashi and the meat is fine. Therefore he'll charge us for one of the portions that we ordered, since we ordered only one portion and not two. We asked to speak with the manager, and Ali said that he already left. When we asked our waitress Sandra to call the manager, she said we just spoke to one... Surprisingly Ali happens to be the owner's son who's apparently ruining his dad's business by providing an awful customer service. If one of your loyal customers requests to return a dish you don't confront him and try to prove him wrong! You should simply apologize and give him a refund. Not one minute passed by and Sandra approached our table again asking if we'd like to order desert and offered boxes to go. We said we're good, but then she said that since this is a dangerous neighborhood the restaurant requests its customers to leave by 9pm, and handed us the bill. We told her we live down the street and we find it offensive that she considers Clairmont as a dangerous neighborhood. She replied "l know, me too". The restaurant was still filled with people. What a rude attempt to kick out your customers. When reviewing the bill we saw that not only they added the raw Mawashi as Ali said he would, but also added 18% gratuity charge to the bill. I happened to eat in many restaurants around the world, and never have I felt so unwanted and disrespected.</review>

I got to first off say the staff is on point to perfection. Very respectful and caring. The hostess wanted to sit my family of four in a warmer area. So we got seated near where the chefs were cooking. My son was amazed by the chefs movements on how fast an precise they did there job. Our server was a tall gentleman that gave us excellent service an very passionate about his job. He suggested us great food and we loved every bite. A gentleman was also sitting near the kitchen area by the chefs an i believe he was the owner of this fine restaurant. Sir thank you for your hospitality, my son appreciated the nice gesture an enjoyed his fries. My family an i will definitely be coming back to try more of these great dishes.<//text>

Awesome service, even though they were very busy. Food was delicious and large portions. Prices are only slightly higher than other places, but definitely worth the extra $. Large menu, there 8s something for everyone. I'll definitely be back.</Review>

The best Middle Eastern food in this country!.
We have been going to this restaurant for 25 years, and every single time the food is as good if not better than the first day they opened. Consistency, quality, service, atmosphere, quantity... all top notch!!!</text>

<user_id>113266336642580442511< /user_id><Text>Aladdin's definitely has the market cornered on Mediterranean food in San Diego. It's often a favorite for a Sunday lunch with my family.

While the location is convenient to the 805 freeway, the parking can be a hassle. It shares the parking lot with other businesses, and while it looks large, it's surprisingly small. The restaurant is super casual, but it feels nice and open. It's always clean, and inviting.

You can't beat the food there. We usually get the Meza Platter - a dish that comes with 8 small dishes that includes hummus, babaganoush, chicken, lamb, and a bunch of other things, along with a pizza. The baklava is great too. Served with ice cream. These three things fed 5 hungry adults. Service is standard and prices are very reasonable.

This place could easily host large parties and kids are always welcomed there.

I always look forward to going to Aladdin's.<//Text>< Rating>

Wow!  Authentic cuisine, obviously made with passion.  And, service that's second to none.  Angie, my wife's and my new friend, is an angel.  Angie, has terrific taste as she recommended the Lamb Shank and it's simply a tremendous dish... fall off the bone tender, and savory and rich.<//Text>

Wow!  Authentic cuisine, obviously made with passion.  And, service that's second to none.  Angie, my wife's and my new friend, is an angel.  Angie, has terrific taste as she recommended the Lamb Shank and it's simply a tremendous dish... fall off the bone tender, and savory and rich.<//text>

<text>Aladdin's definitely has the market cornered on Mediterranean food in San Diego. It's often a favorite for a Sunday lunch with my family.

While the location is convenient to the 805 freeway, the parking can be a hassle. It shares the parking lot with other businesses, and while it looks large, it's surprisingly small. The restaurant is super casual, but it feels nice and open. It's always clean, and inviting.

You can't beat the food there. We usually get the Meza Platter - a dish that comes with 8 small dishes that includes hummus, babaganoush, chicken, lamb, and a bunch of other things, along with a pizza. The baklava is great too. Served with ice cream. These three things fed 5 hungry adults. Service is standard and prices are very reasonable.

This place could easily host large parties and kids are always welcomed there.

I always look forward to going to Aladdin's.<//text>< Pics>

Always great food, great service, they never forget their customers.  Everytime we come here we have a great experience.  Food always fresh.  Plenty of seating especially with their expansion and outdoor seating.  Parking is tight but manageable.   Everything  is directly made on site.  Our kids enjoy dining here, we like the peaceful atmosphere. We always end up bringing home doggy bags there is so much food.  Everything on the menu is very good.  Next time you want a new experience come here you won't regret it!!< /text>

We complained about it to our server. She asked the chef and came back with a weird response. Completely ignoring our talking point, she said that it’s free and it doesn't typically come with that order. I don't know why you would put stale food in front of somebody regardless of that being free.< /review>< Pics>

Today was suppose to be a happy day for my family and I . After my graduation ceremony, my sister called to make a reservation for 11 people and we drove to the restaurant to have my graduation dinner there. This waitress who I don’t recall her name was the most condescending and rude of them all.( I can provide more details upon request).   I will not spent a dime of my money in a place that doesn’t treat all its costumer with respect. When we pointed out her behavior she screamed at us and told us to get out.  I grow up in the Middle East and this is worst treatment I had in an Arabic restaurant.

Don’t come here if you want to have good time without being treated like trash.</Text>

Decent place, great staff and customer service. The owner was very respectful. I was not satisfied with one of the dishes and they accommodated me with another dish with no question asked. I ended up having kofte kabob sandwich wrap, very tasty and juicy. Enjoyed it very much. Definitely going back on my next trip to San Diego.</review>

The hummus and lentil soup was very delicious. Probably the best I've had in San Diego. I got my  wisdom teeth removed so I couldn't try a lot of items on the menu. From my team expressions the another options were amazing as well. I'll be returning to try another options once I'm healed up. 🙂< /review>

Great food, atmosphere, and service.  Generous portions.  My wife had the chicken shawerma, which was some of the best I've had, and she and I split her leftovers for another meal.  I had the mixed grill, which was a LOT of food, and took about half home.  The chicken kabob was especially tender and moist.  Highly recommended.</review>

This is a place you won’t try twice if:
1- You care about the quality of the food. I ordered a mixed shish kebab plate and the lamb kebab was completely burnt! Basically it was lamb flavored carbon. The salad dressing that I make at home is tastier than theirs! And the whole food was soaked in oil.
2- You don’t have extra time to waste waiting to be sited! (There was no line) and then waiting for the waitress to show up!
PS: food is pretty expensive at this place.
Forgot their utensils and has to remind them to bring it. Under staffed.< /Text>

Great food, amazing service and good Turkish coffee! Prices are about midrange, but worth it. Parking is easy and it's easy to get onto Clairemont Mesa Blvd, even during the rush, since they have a traffic light in the parking lot. All the food is great, from the lentil soup to the lamb, and the sampler tray is to die for!< /Review>

<Review>Exceptional Mediterranean fare.  Used this place for a large (250 people) event I needed catered, and was blown away by how outstanding the food was.  The stuffed grape leaves were heavenly - the best I've EVER had... the baba gahnouj, hummus, garlic spread (the heavenly garlic spread), chicken and beef skewers were outstanding, as well.  Every single thing was absolutely amazing - including the service.  I'm a foodie from NYC and I have not had better Mediterranean than this.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

There's few moments where you feel like you literally walked into a place and was transported to another country by its food. This place is one.

Bad customer service! Very Bad ! Posting this after third bad experience here, although we love the food here but won't be going anymore as wait time is long in rush hours, food comes late even if it does come on time, the serving waiter wont come back to see if we needed anything, and if u complain the waiter gets rude not admitting his mistake constantly answering and bickering in rude manners.
I won't bother to come back here because the food is not worth for bad customer treatment.</text>

<Time>1579988743841</Time><text>I don't know where to begin. My wife ordered the lentil soup. It was pureed. I've never had pureed lentils at a Mediterranean restaurant. Maybe I've been eating at inauthentic restaurants or maybe this was just not prepared in the traditional manner. I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich. It was not only greasy, dripping with brown oil, but covered in some indescribable sauce - one I've never had in 53 years of eating Mediterranean food. There were no tomatoes, lettuce or any type of yogurt-based sauce that I've always seen served with shawarma. Again, maybe I've had inauthentic food. Finally, the dolma were the type that have been marinated in tomato sauce. I prefer them without sauce, so this is a preference issue rather than one of authenticity. Regardless, they were not my favorite. Ultimately, this was not a good experience for us, and I don't intend to return.</text><Name>David Miller<//Name>< UserId.>

<Review>Great food, amazing service and good Turkish coffee! Prices are about midrange, but worth it. Parking is easy and it's easy to get onto Clairemont Mesa Blvd, even during the rush, since they have a traffic light in the parking lot. All the food is great, from the lentil soup to the lamb, and the sampler tray is to die for!</Review>< pics>

I Have been going to this restaurant since opening 20 years ago. No finer Mediterranean food and hospitality found in San Diego. Just finished lunch served by non other than Mike,  one of the most friendliest and accomplished waiters in the restaurant business. Top notch.<//review>

One of the best places for Mediterranean in SD, in my opinion. Lots of people go here, but never feels too crowded. I love the kabob plate with different varieties of chicken, beef and lamb. Also, the garlic butter is excellent! The portions are generous. The teas and Turkish coffee is a must. Five stars.<//Text>

I lived in the Middle East for 3 yrs. so I know what that food 🥘 is like and this place has the right ambiance, the nice people and the right recipes.

Extremely rude manager! He kick me and a group of women out of the restaurant just because we asked to speak with the manager and little did we know that he was standing in front of us. He was being inappropriate with the ladies and was cursing at us. He even got into the face of one of the ladies and said "if I want to I can kick you out of my restaurant when ever I feel like it" he said this and many more things that we ended up leaving after he told us to get out. The group of women and myself went to this restaurant to have a nice dinner and have a Christian gathering which the manager made fun of by saying "I can pray for you because I'm a Pastor" and he started laughing after saying this. He started checking out one of the ladies and said "you're the prettiest one here, your smile is gorgeous" he stared looking down her shirt and making her uncomfortable. We wish we would have recorded this and have him fired.  He did a lot more that what I posted. He is a bald man around 5ft 6in and looks a bit Asia. He does speak Spanish as we were a group of Mexican women and everything he said to us was in Spanish. I really hope this man gets fired. We will like to speak with the restaurant owner. Note we were a group of 20 women.< /text>

4 stars for service. 3 stars for food. Bring your own wine as there is none offered. The lamb shank was quite good.</Review>

Excellent! Chicken kebab very tender and tasty. Staff (Angie) friendly and attentive. Will definitely come back. Humus and falafel also tasty....personally like more garlicky but that's just us. Best Mediterranean food we've had.</review>

Busy place (especially at lunchtime), but the pizza is great and the service was above average. It's a bit expensive, and some menu items could be bought in the grocery store, but we'll be back for the pizza!</Review>

<Review>We came here for dinner, and ordered 1 pizza originally, not knowing that these were single serving pizzas. So we ordered a second pizza, and these $15 pizzas each. I am not sure if wood fire pizzas are this expensive, but taste-wise, they were good tasting, not amazing for that price. Also the customer service was not good, we had to wait and continuously call the waiter over for service during our visit. If you are looking for fancy pizza with a date, then this is the place, but not for families.</Review>< userid>

<Review>Best mediterranean food in San Diego, and incredible value.

My coworkers go here, and my friends eat here. Within seconds of walking in, we're greeted, and treated like family.

I usually order a chicken shwarma sandwich, and it's hot, fresh, and at my table in minutes.

The platters are great for sharing or family style. Big groups, or date night, Aladdin's is a wonderful mix of exotic, and comfort food.

The can't miss: baklawa ice cream sandwich is next level dessert.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

The worst customer service ever. The waitress are rude and not professional at all. Owner needs to keep an eye on and watch  his staff closely  if he wants to keep his business growing. Customer service is the foundation of any business’s  success.</Text>

<Review>Please excuse my less than perfect ability to articulate.  Five Stars, why? because my consistent habit with places to eat, is the same. I never deviate from each place I frequent. I ONLY order one of the many offerings from each place I go. This is a life long habit. My 5 stars are very pinpointed at just one group of foods from Aladdin.. chicken hummus garlic paste, tabouli (sp) . This is not only the best tasting chicken in memory, but Aladdin never deviates from a very high standard. Trust me, that is a difficult standard to maintain, year in and year out, but the friendly people at Aladdin accomplish this. Aladdin is not only the best Mediterranean restaurant in San Diego County, but I will go a bit over the top and say, it is the best restaurant.. period. That is because of great flavors, every time!!</Review>< pics>

Best Mediterranean restaurant in San Diego hands down. Been coming here for over seven years and have never been disappointed. Love the homemade baklava and fire oven pita bread that is unlike any other pita bread I've ever had.<//text>

Authentic Mediterranean food!
Mixed Grill is my favorite here. They serve it as the combination of chicken and lamb kabobs along with Lamb chops. It is very tender and juicy.
You can also try hummus with shawarma in Appetizer.
Pita bread and salad are complementary .
Staffs are friendly and courteous.</text>

The food is real good, decent portions for lunch.  Staff is real friendly and helpful.  But the odd thing is in the dining room is a large fridge with the Costco bags of lettuce used in the salads.  Just an odd location for food storage.< /Review>

You should come here at least once. When you do you'll want to keep coming here every now and then. One of the best places for Mediterranean food. The owner is really friendly.

They serve halal food.</Review>

<Review>The Chicken Shawerma is enough for 2, with a salad along for the ride. Lovely cardamom notes in the chicken complement the yoghurt garlic sauce rather well, with the obligatory hummus. Though don't mistake obligatory with pedestrian, as the hummus is also damn good. All in all, fat 'n happy.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
It seems to be a mix of Mediterranean,  Middle Eastern and even some Indian dishes.  I had the tika lamb kebab. The meat was cooked just right. My husband had Lamb Kafta (sausage). Both dishes came with rice,  salad and hummus. Plenty of food. He liked it. I tried it, and thought it was very flavorful, and also tender (not overcooked). Service was slightly slow to start, but once we ordered, picked up.  Busy place. A little loud, but it was a Friday evening. Owners? and staff are nice and pleasant to customers.<//Review>

<Text>The service was spectacular! Very friendly and attentive  (but not too much so). This meal came with an enormous veggie salad, simply dressed with a light vinaigrette and just what this hungry traveler needed. (Air travel etc, immediately makes me feel fruit/veg deficient.) The chicken kebabs were just amazing! Tender, juicy, and so tasty- the best I've had since living in Turkey. And don't get me started on the freshest, most delicious baklava I have ever tasted!! I will definitely go back if my travels ever bring me to San Diego again.</Text><user>110619281708475011339<//user><gmapID>0x80dc007fa3e9c5b5:0x427c328d753e044d< /gmapID><rating>5< /rating>< username>

<Time>1563418912576</Time><text>An evergreen favorite for Lebanese food.  Every dish is freshly prepared, full of color and zest.  The appetizer list has a lot to offer - hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, lamb and cheese borak.  One can make a meal out of the appetizers alone.  The kebabs are all very succulent and delicious and served with tangy green salad.  Finally, baklava is a super must for everyone visiting this restaurant.  I tried baklava in Greece but Aladdin is far better in every way.< /text><UserId.>114095139805957100445< /UserId.>< Pics>

<text>Food is good but still I wish there was an option to rate 0 or negative because of their behavior. I gave 5 dollars of tip and while getting into my car, the waiter came to my car and ASKED RUDELY and FORCED me to give more tip amount and told that it’s LAW in USA to give tip amount to be more than 22%. As they have my credit card information so I gave more tips. It’s horrible and surprisingly extreme rude behavior. Also FYI in their menu it’s written that “In USA it’s customary to give 15-22% of tips”.< /text>< UserId.>

The food here is excellent. I found the meat had more flavor​ than the chicken. Service is great. Plenty of parking. They have outdoor seating as well.</Review>

<review>Do not get this place confused with a lesser quality substitute, also called Aladdin, located in Hillcrest. This is a great restaurant. When ordering out using a delivery service, verify you’re selecting this place; the correct place with best quality that’s located in Clairemont Mesa Blvd.< /review>< pictures>

This is one of our favorites! The service is always great as well as the food. My favorite off the menu is the #4 chicken platter. It is amazingly great! They have TVs in the back room and don't forget to order a side dish of garlic sauce (toum)</Review>

Love the food, not the smell of lingering cleaning product that affects taste. Eat on patio or take out.</Review>

<Review>For the prices they're charging I was expecting a treat. Pretty mediocre. The portions aren't generous and the flavour lacks the authenticity. But the lamb tikka was the highlight of the order that I made. Most Middle Eastern restaurants in San Diego offer their meat tikka in either beef or veal, not lamb.
Imho, Sultan Baklava (on 4th Ave) is still the best experience for ME cuisine in terms of authenticity, flavour and generosity of their portions.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dc007fa3e9c5b5:0x427c328d753e044d<//gmap_id><rate>2</rate>< UserId.>

One of my all time favorites. Yes a little pricey. But the quality of food you're getting well worth it. Everything we ordered was fantabulous! I had the lamb beef in a pita. My husband had the lamb chops. Both where cooked exceptionally well! Yes I'll be back! The baklava was fresh and delish.< /Text>

Food definitely goes above and beyond. The pizza may have been the weak link (definitely not finger food, still tasted good) but everything else was amazing. Manager was my waiter, definitely very passionate and the staff is friendly. 4.5/5 for the food (for now), 5/5 experience, the baklava is a 6/5. Somewhat pricy but the taste of the baklava leaves a priceless inpression.< /Text>

This is the best food in town.  Hamdi's facility is awesome and Mike the manager is incredible. If you want great Greek Food, there is no other place to go in San Diego.  You can take that to the bank.</Review>

Tasty choices, meat skewers combo and kebeh are incredible, large portions, nice ambiance, little $$$ compared to other places, clean, good service.</Review>

The cheese and the spinach borak appetizers were quite good, but the lentil soup was fairly average. The lamb shish kebab was tasty but a little bit on the tough side. The ambiance does not quite equal the prices</text>

Very friendly and personable owner, yes the prices are a little above average but portions are large and sharing is recommended. We had a large group there on father's day and had to make a last minute reservation and they were very accommodating. Hummus and Baba ganoush are authentic. Busy on weekends.< /Text>

The best Mediterranean food in San Diego. The hummus with chicken schwarma is delicious, house made pita is always fresh and warm; the chicken kabobs are always moist and flavorful, cheese borak is great for people who love cheese, they're bite sized and come with a mint sauce. This place made me a convert to loving Greek food.< /review>

If I could give 10 stars I would.  My favorite dish is the shish mix. Everything is seasoned well including the salad and the pita...  I need to cut this review short or I'll order some.< /Text>

Great food and service for a locally-owned establishment. Been around for years and the Mediterranean food is phenomenal. Somewhat of a hidden gem I would imagine if you never heard of it before. Worth trying out. They also have free Wi-Fi.</Text>

Food was amazing and really affordable. We got the mix plate of grilled meats, a huge salad, assorted pickled veggies, grilled veggies, drinks for 4 and an appertizer for $50. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the service. They need to hire more people. Plus I witnessed the manager yelling at customers because they were late to their reservation and was seated by a waitress that didnt know they were late. The manager came out and began yelling at them saying they cant just sit down after being 45 minutes late. The customers were trying to tell him over his screaming that they didnt just sit down they were sat down by the waitress. Very unprofessional.</Review>

<text>OMG!  This place is amazing!  From the hummus and pita bread appetizer to the gyros and Shawarma chicken sandwiches the food was to die for.

The place is busy and consequently, noisy but with good reason.

We had planned to eat at a Thai place across the street which was closed on a Sunday at lunch time so we decided to try Aladdin’s.

I’m sooooo glad we did.

We will be back.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>The staff were very rude. They seemed prejudice because I saw that they were serving  good  to white    customers  and serving bad to black customers.   The food was expensive and did not worth paying such that racist and unprofessional staff. You better go somewhere else.</Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< Pictures>

One of the best Lebanese places to eat. There is not one thing that I don't like. Shwarma, Fatoush, Falafel are only a few of the dishes they prepare fresh everyday. This has been my measurement for all Mediterranean restaurant to match. Constantly the best!< /Text>

Box falafel, store bought hummus, and dolmas have more flavor! The falafel was over cooked with no flavor. The hummus and basmati also had no flavor. Their dolmas tasted Italian. The pita bread was not vegan even though their website said it was. The manager was very rude, humming throughout, knocking on tables, and ordering the waitress over. We had to ask for a side hummus because it didn’t come with pita bread and got half an order of hummus with more pita bread! They seem shorted staff. The food was edible, but I definitely DO NOT recommend!!</review>

If you haven't eaten here, you are missing out!<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80dc007fa3e9c5b5:0x427c328d753e044d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Been coming here for years.  The food is always delicious.  It can be crowded but the wait staff won't leave you stranded.  I've eaten the whole menu, not in one sitting, and everything is good.  Lamb Borak ftw!<//text>

The falafel was at best a Mediterranean hush puppy. The Greek salad was great, very plentiful and the chicken shawrema wrap was mostly tortilla. I would say lavash, but it tasted like a tortilla.<//text>

<Review>We ordered mix grill, French fries, and motabbal. The meats were seasoned & cooked perfectly. The French fries was Crispy and soft (it had alot of oil though). And the motabbal was just on point, no excess oil, not too little. However, the service were either annoying or careless. We had two servers apparently a Mexican women and an Asian man. The Mexican women seemed like she didn't want to work, whereas, the man was overly excited to work that he began to annoy with his refrains throughout the experience.
In short: great food, shabby service.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Great place! Probably the best Mediterranean restaurant I've ever been!
We took big wonderful plate of greek chicken salad, #11 mixed grill (it had big rice plate) and cheese borak. Everything was very delicious with adequate prices and good enough for 4 adults and a child!
Cabernet Sauvignon was not that great, but it's not a wine place though:)< /Review>

Cute atmosphere, wide selection of herbal teas and Mediterranean foods. They have hookah, so I think it's a hookah bar at night. The falafel appetizer was really delicious. I wish they served it Amsterdam Falafel style (WDC friends know what I'm talking about). Comes with pita triangles and tahini. I ordered a Greek salad, and the Greek salad was very good - I made little falafel pitas with the salad.
Mylo got the Fatoush salad, and it looked a little lacking - seemed to be light on the s'mac but they were really skimpy on the pita chips and didn't have feta on it although you can add it. Salad itself was large. Dave got the lamb schwarma and he said it was good. It came with a nice little greek salad, but I will have to try the schwarma for myself -- looked like it might be dry. Turkish coffee is delicious. Has a bit of minty flavor, which was quite pleasant.

Meal menu is a bit overpriced, service can be slow.< /Text>

<Text>We had 2 plates, #3 and #4, i.e chiken and lamb with rice, hummus, salat, etc. The chiken was very good, very tasty and i loved it with the garlic sauce. The lamb on the other hand was very chewwy, neither of us liked it. The service is very good and super friendly.< /Text>< Pictures>

Can't speak much to the meat because I'm vegan, but the falafel here is EVERYTHING, and the hummus and pita are also very good. I also like that the vegan-friendly items are clearly labeled on the menu. A+< /text>

What a place we chose for Mothers day, got 2 thumbs up.

I was under immense pressure taking Wife out for Lunch on Mothers day, who is picky and can afford very small room of error. But she was blown away by the food.
We ordered, Lamb Biriyani, Pita bread with Garlic sauce, Chicken Tika Kabob and Kanafa.

Everything was so perfect along with our Waitress Dana, she was very pleasant. To end, Kanafa stole our hearts. We will go there again, soon. For Garlic Sausce and Kanafa :)

Mothers day was succesful, mission accomplished. She even forgot that i did not get her flowers ;)</Text>

Best Mediterranean food I've ever had. The food was fresh and sizzling. As a vegetarian, I ordered the falafel sandwich... I was pleasantly surprised to find the falafels were cooked perfectly, immersed in fresh vegetables and spices. My boyfriend ordered some crazy meat platter (shiskabob combo) and he was overwhelming surprised by the perfection of flavors as well. I'm writing this now because we kept repeating over and over again that was freakin' amazing. These guys did Aladdin justice :) if I'm ever back in California, I'll be coming here for sure.<//Text>

Can have quite the lunch crowd, but there's also plenty of space and AMAZING food. The lamb shawarma, pita and garlic dip were our favorites.<//Text>

Food seemed very bland. We ordered chicken shawarma and it didn't have enough spice in it. Service wasn't good. The falafal wasnt crispy as you would expect them to be. However tabouli which we ordered as a side was tasty and their pita bread  is fresh.< /Text>

The service was poor... food was poor for the price, $27 for 1 order and mind you this is not a fancy restaurant just an average Cafe.... and floor was dirty... I will not go back there</review>

What a place we chose for Mothers day, got 2 thumbs up.

I was under immense pressure taking Wife out for Lunch on Mothers day, who is picky and can afford very small room of error. But she was blown away by the food.
We ordered, Lamb Biriyani, Pita bread with Garlic sauce, Chicken Tika Kabob and Kanafa.

Everything was so perfect along with our Waitress Dana, she was very pleasant. To end, Kanafa stole our hearts. We will go there again, soon. For Garlic Sausce and Kanafa :)

Mothers day was succesful, mission accomplished. She even forgot that i did not get her flowers ;)<//Review>

<Time>1604477307581</Time><rating>1< /rating><Review>(Translated by Google) The restaurant offers very nice and delicious food, but unfortunately the chef in charge of the restaurant is begging for the customers, knowing that the customer is not obliged to pay the tea and it is optional and it comes with all finesse and the customer argues about the amount of tobacco and says why it is less and should pay more. This is the first and last time I go to this restaurant. Unfortunately, the reputation of the restaurant will lose a lot because of these behavior

المطعم يقدم طعام جميل ولذيذ جدا  ولكن مع الاسف الشيف المسؤول على المطعم يستجدي التب من الزبائن مع العلم ان الزبون غير مجبر على دفع التب وهو اختياري وياتي بكل صلافة ويجادل الزبون على مبلغ التب ويقول لماذا هو قليل ويجب أن تدفع اكثر   . هذه اول واخر مرة اذهب بها الى هذا المطعم . مع الاسف سمعة  المطعم ستخسر كثيرا بسبب هذه التصرفات<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>(Translated by Google) Everyone was very friendly and naive. We loved the waiter friend. The location is very clean. The prices are also affordable, because the menus are great. Middle East and Mediterranean people who can't get used to American food can feed their bellies. We ate a mixed grill with two people, we were full of mis. As a result, go eat friends, taco does not work this :) I also put the menu there. Enjoy your meal.

(Original)
Herkes çok güler yüzlü ve naif. Garson arkadaşa bayıldık. Mekan gayet temiz. Fiyatlar da uygun, menüler büyük çünkü. Amerikan yemeklerine bir türlü alışamayan Ortadoğu ve Akdenizliler karnını bir güzel doyurabilir. Biz bir mixed grill’i iki kişi yedik, mis gibi de doyduk. Sonuç olarak gidin yiyin arkadaş, tacoyla olmuyor bu iş :) menüyü de koyuyorum şuraya. Afiyet olsun.</review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) The amounts of meals are excessive. It is unnecessary so much to justify the price. Better would be lower prices with healthier portions. Tea is another example ... You get a huge bag and only a glass instead of a kettle ... Ridiculous. The meats are very good as positive. The restaurant should take more care of your image.

(Original)
Las cantidades​ de comidas son excesivas. Es innecesario tanta cantidad para justificar el precio. Mejor sería precios más reducidos con porciones más saludables. El té es otro ejemplo... Te dan una bolsa enorme y solo un vaso en vez de una tetera... Ridículo. Las carnes están muy buenas como positivo. El restaurante debería cuidar más su imagen.<//Review>
