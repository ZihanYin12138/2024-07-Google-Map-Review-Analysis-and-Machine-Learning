The best barbers in the bay area. All of the guys are great! Very skilled on the barber arts, they all can do killer fades, and they're all extremely attentive and customer-oriented. This is the friendliest barber shop I've ever visited. I normally get my haircut by Rodney, but I've also had Gabriel and Ryan. They are all pros.

I mean just check out this pompadour + undercut fade I got this morning...< /text>

Had a great experience getting my hair cut here. I had never thought too much about my hair cut, and came to get the long -> short transformation. I explained to my barber Dillon that I wasn't too sure how to express what I wanted, but that I had a few things I didn't like with my older haircuts, and a general idea of what I wanted. He went through each one of these with me, and was able to give me a haircut that I am incredibly happy with. Even though I'm moving out of the RWC area, I may consider coming back here for touch ups.<//Text>

It took awhile for Redwood City to actually open a few for men only barber shops   I like the good'ole days when Super Cuts was good enough, but now as teenager, Redwood Barber Co is the only place he'll go. So they're doing something right! A little on the pricier side, but the great customer service helps with the price shock.<//Review>

<review>My go to place for a haircut. Decent prices ($35 for regular haircut), nice barbers and great location - right outside of downtown. I do not have barber preference (they are all really good!) and book online, no phone calls needed. This is a place that feels comfortable and it's up to you whether you would like a conversation or just watch sports during the job is done.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< time>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Edit/Update: 4 Stars - The owner reached out to me directly and assured me that the policy was reiterated to the team and the appropriate performance coaching took place. He also facilitated an appointment at cost for the time wasted in the concerns listed below. This ownership of the issues in place, and swift resolution is deserving of 5 stars if only the previous did not take place listing it at 4.

1 Star - Unfortunately the owner does not respect customers and upholding a quality of service standard with all of his contractors. In the past, appointments with Redwood barber went well, the atmosphere is nice enough, Omar G was my preferred barber, and the pricing is appropriate for the services.

In an attempt to cancel a beard and shave (75 min appointment) due to a company emergency taking place, and giving them more than an hour notice, I was transferred to Dillon (my scheduled barber)  an with over hour in advance to adhere with their 1 hour cancelation policy.
Dillon continued to state that due to the type of cut a longer notice cancelation policy of 2 hours was the requirement and we would need to work something out because cancellation was not an option, after nearly 5 minutes of conversation I was harassed into trying to still make it roughly 15 to 30 minutes late, where Dillon specified he would cancel the shave to keep it in the time windows. Naturally due to the fact a work emergency takes precedence as per my initial cancellation call, I was unable to make it.

Fast forward a couple months, I place a cut and beard trim request at 9:45am on a weekday, to find it cancelled 2 hours before the appointment. I called to find out why, where the owner replies because I was a no show for my previous appointment with Dillon. I go on to explain the context of what took place, and the owners conclusion was that I would need to go in and pay Dillon for the missed appointment if I ever want to resume service because that is their policy. So because Dillon didn't follow policy and pressured a customer out of a cancellation, I am obligated to pay him for services not performed.

The lack of professionalism, and inability to hold employees accountable, while accusing a customer with phone log proof of heresay has lost them dozens of customers as a courtesy to other professionals in my personal and corporate circle.

If you are a working professional with a challenging calendar schedule, or simply an adult with responsibilities, I strongly advise against visiting this shop or you too could be harassed into paying for services not performed because of a schedule conflict cancellation.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<review>Straight forward haircuts at a real mans barber shop. A little pricey but they make up for it by including a hair rinse or hot towel treatment with every haircut. The atmosphere is great and the barbers are really easy to talk to. All around great barber shop, I will absolutely be coming back for my next haircut.< /review></record>

This is my new favorite spot on the peninsula. Every barber is super friendly and cool. The detail of the haircut is impeccable.

The atmosphere is great too. They always have a ball game on the tv, and have some good music in the background.

Perfect place for that barbershop feel, and the barbers can do really great modern style cuts, as well as traditional.<//review>

I really like their slick reservation system. No waiting!

I may try a different barber next time I'm there, depending on my schedule.

This place is clean, professional. The barbers are friendly too!

Parking can be a challenge but you'll may need to circle a few times. The neighborhood is safe.

I'll be back next month!</Text>

Great place! New school look with an old school feel. Haircuts show the experience is there and the barbers are very welcoming.<//Text>

<Review>I was pretty skeptical after having a bad experience with another barber in the area (I just recently moved out here), but this place is very professional and gets the job done. Very rare to find non black barbers that can cut black hair!</Review>< user_name>

This place is a hoax. I was 15 mins late for an appointment, but they refused to serve and still charged for $30. And they are very rude.

Definitely avoid this place if you have other options.<//Text>
<Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1518669625089, 'text': 'Hi Yang, sorry this wasn’t explained correctly to you. Our policy is if you arrive more than 10min after your scheduled appointment without calling, it is considered a no show.  We did not charge you for the service because you did not receive a haircut. However, in order to re-book with us we do require you pay for the missed service at your next appointment.  We do our best to stay on time for all our patrons, so taking customers 10 minutes late would cause us to run late for each appointment for the rest of the day. Our policy for no show/no call appointments is because our barbers do not get paid hourly and this is how we account for our time.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJames S.'}<//Resp>< GmapID>

< Review>
The only reason they get one star is because zero out of five is not an available entry. The disparity between the haircut I asked for and the haircut I received both times I went here is a mile wide.  The first time I went here I received a bad haircut, but the location was convenient to my work so I decided to give them a second chance. Went back today and received a terrible haircut. I am embarrassed - I have to go to another barber to get this fixed. This is like if you gave your older brother a pair of clippers and he played a joke on you. Will not return and I suggest you don't either.<//Review>

<text>Absolutely in love with this Montessori, right blend of academic plus play and learn. My kid loves every minute  he spends in there. They provide a very adaptive environment for the kids to grow on their own pace but giving personal attention to each and every child's growth. I would definitely recommend the school to prep your kid for kindergarten and moving on. A very healthy environment that every child deserves with a variety of activities that can engage each and every child and give them the million dollar smile while learning and growing positively each day.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Hi all!
I am giving this facility a 4 star because there is always room for improvement. I am the daughter of the head teacher Mrs. Daksha. I do not mean this to be biased in any way, I am just here to give my honest opinion about this school. First of all, the head teacher has a daughter so that means she knows how to properly understand a child's feelings and how to help them be a better person. All the other teachers help out the kids in many was as well. Me as a teenager; I help out in the school and I always notice how the teachers will immediately help the kids in need. The facility has a huge backyard which allows the kids to roam around and explore many plants (of course with adult supervision). My mom a.k.a Mrs. Daksha treats her kids like her own, she will love them with a full heart and always make them the best individual they can be. This is also a "Home based" preschool so it provides the kids with a feeling like home.  In conclusion, I highly recommend this school for a positive, homely, and loving atmosphere for your child.
Thanks!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I am giving a 4 star rating for this school because I  believe there is always scope for improvement and didn’t want to stymie that possibility by giving a 5 :)

Having said that, my feedback here is based on my visit to this home school and the attitude of the owners towards running this school, their passion to provide a holistic learning experience to kids and the love and affection that they put into the kids that come to this school. I have not personally taken this school’s service but if I had a need to send a kid to a home based school, I wouldn’t think twice before choosing this service.

Key positives about this school that I find,

* The owners are passionate about providing holistic education to kids - academic , personal growth, values in life , life skills , learnings from diverse cultures.

* money alone doesn’t drive this business. It is driven by a long term passion to educate kids holistically and love for kids and getting inspired by the young minds. The owner has narrated several stories about the inquisitive minds of kids and how being amongst them provides a positive vibe to the entire school. They seem to learn from each other - teachers learning from kids and vice versa , which shows the open mindedness of the owners and the positive ambience at this place.

* the personal care that the owners take for the kids is awesome. I have personally seen them painstakingly go to farmers market every week and buy high quality fruits for their school kids and makes no compromises whatsoever . In essence they treat them as their own kids.

* safety and security are on top most priority. They have invested lot of money in setting up the infrastructure for the school and doesn’t hesitate to attend to the needs immediately. Recently an unforeseen tripping of a child during playing in their garden , made them immediately level their backyard play area to prevent future incidents. The action was immediate highlighting safety of their kids is their utmost priority and cannot be compromised.

* their curriculum is diverse and takes cues from various resources available and makes it holistic.

Above all, the kids seem to miss the school on holidays & long to go back to the school and I have heard this from many of the parents firsthand. This vouches for the rating of this school better than anything else :)< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp><Rate>4< /Rate>< Time>

She is really passionate about teaching and truly loves to work with kids. Ms Daksha has many years of experience as Montessori teacher and treats each kid as her own. The whole family follows covid appropriate behavior not only during school hours but all the time including weekends to ensure student’s health is not risked by the school.

The school has spacious front and back yard play area, plenty of flower, fruits and vegetable plants. Newly constructed, spacious and Neat & clean classroom with plenty of educational games and activities.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><userid>106903919987268784050<//userid>< rating>

<Text>My son is going to Little Learners Academy for almost 1.5 years now.  He wakes up every morning looking forward to going to school and that in itself speaks for how good the school is.

Their curriculum is very impressive and there is tons of art, music and sensory activities. Ms Daksha is a very loving and a caring teacher. Kids are so comfortable being with her and they absolutely love their teacher.

What I like here is their constant communication with parents regarding their child’s progress.

I would highly recommend Little Learners Academy to everyone and especially the ones who are looking for the first school/care for their kids.

Thank you so much for all the love and care.<//Text>< rate>

Little learners academy is the coolest place for younger kids. The facility is very clean and well organized. I would highly recommend this day care/ school to any parent looking safe and enriching environment for their kids. The teachers are well acquitted to adhere to kids needs while the parents are away.

Ms. Daksha makes it her top priority to communicate kids progress on a regular basis. She is very patient and constantly finding new ways to keep the kids active.< /text>

<text>I would say it’s the best Montessori style schools in the Fremont area,  and that’s because of three key reasons.
#1 The main teacher - Mrs. Gitanjali cares and treats all the kids like her own and that’s one thing we always want as it gives us peace of mind
#2 Great emphasis on learning with a good balance of play / activities. Kids improvement month-over-month was so obvious.
#3 It is a vegetarian only program something that makes them unique and attractive for families who are vegetarian/ vegan

I would highly recommend little learners academy to anyone. Keep doing what you guys are doing!</text>< resp>

I know the couple who run this very well and I have seen first hand their love for imparting quality education. They are also ardent lovers of nature and it’s conservancy and are imparting that to their Montessori kids. They have a well maintained organic flower and vegetable garden  that they use to teach kids healthy living.</Review>

< review>
Our little one absolutely loves this school and has learned everything here.
My kids has been here for over a year now. I love that the class size is small so there is more one on one interaction, and more focus based on each kids ability.
There are lot of educational and fun activities planned before hand esp based on songs and art which is something truly motivated my kid.
Ms.Daksha is the perfect blend of mothers love,care and discipline.She takes care of every kid like her own. She is flexible and really accommodating to any needs for the betterment of the kid . The little kids would be so calm around her it was amazing.
I would recommend this school hands down to everyone and especially the ones who are looking for the first school/care for their kids.
Thank you so much for all the love and care.</review>

This daycare has absolutely been a life saver for us and have had a huge positive impact on my kid's life. My son joined Little Learners academy when he was 4 yo. He had just finished frontline treatment for childhood leukemia and had been home for over 9 months. He was behind when it comes to writing and reading skills when he joined the day care. With Ms. Daksha's help, he started reading almost overnight. His writing, coloring and motor skills also have seen a tremendous improvement. Ms. Daksha has been so understanding and accommodating of my son's delicate health condition. She keeps the premises spick and span and is very compassionate with him.

<rate>5</rate><text>Had an unexpected transmission issue.  The entire transmission had to be replaced.  Not only did Josh and his team deliver, but they delivered sooner than promised - almost a week and a half sooner.  Anyone with an RV knows that repairs can take time.  Josh , Victor, and the team were professional, courteous, and very up front with costs.  I did my homework and shopped around.  This is my second time in (first time was for service) and I continue to be impressed with their knowledge and recommendations.  They will treat you like family and your vehicle like their own.  Also, they let me have my vehicle towed right to their lot.  My own RV dealer couldn't make that happen.  Thanks again Auto & RV Specialists!< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQkuRoqviMhjrO-V7GDd2B7BshwnLppcZuKGxa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

Found this place as a referral from a friend and can't say enough good things about Josh and his team. I had them do some warranty work on our 2020 Momentum and was extremely pleased with the work they did. That says a ton because I'm picky as hell. Since then I have had them install solar panels on the roof and couldn't be happier with how clean it looks. If you need your RV repaired this is the place to go!</text>

They worked on my 1965 mustang fixing the transmission it had a leak from the dipstick tube along with the 2 band adjustment seals. And re adjustment of the bands. Picked car up with no leaks at all with better shifting of the car. I recommend anyone that values there cars like I do to take it to the Auto and RV Specialist in Rancho Cucamonga. Great service with great prices with a on time pick up of your vehicles. Thanks Bill Duke 🏁<//Review>

<Review>Josh is the most knowledgeable RV and motorcoach repair expert I've met or had work on our RV.

His company has fixed roof leaks, replaced deep cycle batteries, installed new awnings, installed tow package, oil changes....just figure if you have a repair need, Josh and his team will be the favorite RV repair company you'll ever want hire.

Solid and trusted service!</Review><user_id>108915159881442931234<//user_id>< rate>

I took my trailer in to have a few adjustments made and get propane tanks filled. Josh and Tammy were so friendly and so helpful. Josh spent extra time with me answering my questions and the entire experience was so positive and easy. I will definitely go back to this place when I need anything done to my trailer.< /review>

If you own an rv, you know how challenging it can be to find excellent rv mechanics as well as getting a timely appointment. Well, look no more. They really know their stuff here and do their best to get you in and out. The dealer where I bought my rv couldn't schedule us for 3 months for a critical issue with our fridge. We would have had to cancel a long-planned trip. Here they were able to squeeze us in. It took a couple of weeks to get it all done, but our trip was saved! Super nice people in front office and in the garage. I highly recommend this business!<//Text>

We also asked Josh to have the technician look at any other maintenance items that may need attention to ensure our next trip out was without incident.  Josh was a  complete delight to work with as he kept in touch with us throughout the service and communicated any outstanding issues we should address.  The technician spent a great deal of time of the generator, air conditioning units (in dash and top mounted), converter and inverter to ensure proper diagnosis and servicing.  We are very pleased with the service, professionalism, and communication we received during our service at Auto & RV Specialists and would definitely recommend them.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Really enjoyed working with you on this upgrade and look forward to our future together. “You’re adventure awaits “'}<//resp><text>Upgraded suspension on my 27 ft. Travel Trailer, repacked wheel bearings, cleaned & adjusted electric brakes.
Josh ordered all the “specialized parts” for the upgrade and the installation was done right the first time.

All the work was done faster than I planned (a good thing 😀) and the price was fare.

Josh took a personal interest in my upgrades & maintenance and explained everything to be done, unlike bigger shops where you are just a number.

A very positive experience. I will come back for all my maintenance, repairs and future upgrades.

I recommend Auto & RV Specialists for any work you may need on an RV.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< username>

<review>The mechanics at Auto and RV Specialists have been working on the last three of my RVs.  I trust them to do what we agree needs to be done and not to overcharge me.  The people in the office are business like and friendly.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
RV was Towed in by AAA, we’re were welcomed and taken car of very nicely considering we could see that they had other appointments ahead of us.  They gave us the option of a quick fix to get us home and a run down of what we needed to fix it properly. Honestly even thought I have two RV places close to my home I’ll drive the 52 miles to get these guys to do any work on my RV!<//Review>

<Review>I came in with no AC and bad brakes on my '94 Winnie on a HOT day. The guys at Auto and RV Specialists were friendly, competent, and above all honest and transparent. The brake job was worse than expected, and they sent pictures to make sure I understood the magnitude of the work. Easy to work with, got the job done quickly and for a good price. Highly recommended!<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>I've been a full-time RV'er for almost 3 year's now and after visiting several other RV center's during that time Auto And Rv Specialist is my new #1 go to guys and it's my privilege to burn a little extra gas to drive past their competitors on my way to them.

I have a low mileage 92 Jambo which isn't the 2019 diesel pusher most places are looking to milk money out of or so is the vibe I've gotten in the past and from my first visit here I felt treated like a local showing up for a BBQ, these are real people who you can tell enjoy their job's and helping others and where I feel my business no matter how much I'm spending at the time is just as appreciated as anyone else's.

And their much more economical for me, $30 less on my smog check than anyone else quoted me and they had me out in just under an hour with an appointment, their dump fee is at a minimum half or even less than I've paid anywhere else and it's available 24/7 (call them for details), chemicals here are either cheaper or the same price than I've paid  elsewhere and the propane price is very regionally competitive and discounted on Wednesday.

And as you can read below in other reviews and most intelligent RV'ers and car driver's already know NO ONE could afford to give away free diagnostics and stay in business, not even our doctor's, but for any advice on accessories or other similar guidance these guy's are spot on and have very patiently given me the professional advice for my particular coaches needs.

Thank you everyone at Auto and RV Specialist, during what's become a more difficult time for myself and many other Americans you've stepped up for me as a small business, obviously take extra care to keep me and my RV safe and I always leave your driveway happy happy happy.

I just can't wait to try the restaurant after it safely be reopened, I can tell by pics it's almost everyone's kinda place. 🍺<//Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1596404581119, 'text': 'Man, we are so thankful for customers like you. We are truly grateful for your kind words.'}</resp>< gmap_id>

Little pricey but the service is 5star.
Got propane

Was able to pull in with the Corolla on my tow dolly behind my 30' coach. Get propane and they quickly torqued my lugs to make sure they were good.

<Text>I was going to take my car to a mechanic that was referred by a friend to me because I'm not from the area. Upon speaking with Triple A, they said they would refer me to a local mechanic and on top of that get a 25% discount for using them so I trusted them and opted to go with their recommendation. Later I found out that not only  was I being a charged for the work that was done, but they charged me a $100.00 fee just for telling me what my problem was. WHAT? I've never been to a mechanic that charges a separate fee just to tell me what is wrong with my car. I wouldn't recommend Auto &  RV Specialists to anyone unless they have rely deep pockets and money doesn't matter. I wouldn't give it any stars but I had no choice in order to complete this recommendation.</Text><rate>1<//rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1571761265414</date>< gmap_id>

<Text>Went In for a smog check with a car I don’t use very often and had to jump  start it prior to going. Mechanic came back 5 minutes later and told me the car couldn’t be tested because the car had to be driven at least 50 miles before the computer on the car would reset and be able to be tested. I said okay I’ll go drive it. He then told me but first you have to pay for the test? They charged me $39 dollars for that tidbit of information!? I drove the car for the 50 miles and came back thinking I would not be charged again! Wrong! I was double charged! After explaining my financial situation being handicapped and on a fixed income Josh gave me a $15 dollar discount. I’m a repeat customer with a few cars being serviced here! Wow! I have given 5 star reviews in the past but not this time! I feel I was taken advantage of instead of being treated like a valued repeat customer a simple go drive it 50 miles and come back would have been the right thing to do. My car did pass the smog test after the fact, but I’m not sure I’ll be back. Really disappointed that my customer loyalty wasn’t appreciated! I should have read the Yelp reviews. I have another car that will be needing a smog test soon and this was my go to place. ☹️<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1562115630617, 'text': 'I am so sorry your experience with us was not very good. Please forgive me for that.  We did “test” your vehicle the first time and the result decided by the State of California was “not ready.” We are bound by B.A.R. Law the says we can not question you before a smog test. We must run the car as it comes in. We agreed to follow all the rules and regulations when we signed up to become a star certified smog center. If we break those rules we could lose our license and no longer be able to provide this service to our customers.  The “Free retest” was a promotion started by another business and is not a state smog thing.  Our technicians deserve to get paid for the work they do and that is why we charge for each test. It is not fair to ask our techs to work for free. We provided you with copies of both tests and if you need additional copies we can provide those. I thank you for your continued loyalty and was the reason I gave you a discount on your 2nd smog test. Again I apologize for any inconvenience.'}<//response><GmapID>0x80c3376c19aee0f1:0xb890c83acdd64d73<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Josh is the kind of mechanic that once you've found him, you don't give him up.  Honest, knowledgeable, frank, polite/courteous, and friendly are a few of the descriptions that I can muster.  Cars/trucks are the passion of his life, and it shows.  I used to drive from Covina, CA up to the Pinon Hills to have him work on my Ford van.  Now he's a little closer in Rancho Cucamonga...all the better.  I can HIGHLY recommend him.  He's a fine human being and a stellar mechanic.< /Text>

I was referred to Auto & RV Specialists by a client at my office. I have since been in 3-4 times in the last 2 years. I make an appointment, my vehicle is serviced right away when I come in and have always been treated very well. Unlike some of those fast lube places, they don't try to scare you and make you pay for a lot of extra services you don't need right away. I feel comfortable that my truck is being well taken care of and that if something comes up in the future I can trust Auto & RV Specialists!<//text>

I recently had some suspension work done on my 5th Wheel trailer.  The crew at Auto & RV Specialists took my trailer in the morning and were done by the afternoon. The same day service was fantastic.  Giant RV takes a minimum of 5 weeks. They are priced fairly and they are very friendly.  Hopefully I won't need work done anytime soon but, if I do they are my first choice.</Text>

<Text>I had a wonderful experience with this shop.  I was traveling to Palm Springs when my car almost lost a rear wheel. My car was towed to a AAA yard that evening and then AAA recommended Auto and RV Specialists to fix my car the following morning.  Moses was so helpful and communicative. He received my car without me being there as I had to rent a car and drive to Palm Springs the evening before.  He assessed the damage and called me to inform me that they could get it fixed before their closing time.  He also made arrangements with me to leave my car in their lot until late that evening when I could come and pick it up. They were fair, courteous and prompt.  It was a great experience in the face of what could have been a disaster!  I recommend them highly! Lisa< /Text><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Be careful RV owners! Don’t believe 5 star comments by their friends and family. Overpriced and rude. I would give them Zero stars but that does not appear to be an option. Terrible business, this is a shade tree mechanic. .. actually I didn't see any shade trees. Just dishonest business owner. Regret ever meeting this guy. If you like getting ripped off, you'll love this people.</review>

Love this place. I had about 5 issues with my RV ranging from minor (awning was twisted) to major (living slide out wasn't working).

I dropped it off in their key drop off on a Sunday. They had the keys back in my hand with all of my issues resolved by Friday. It's like my RV is factory new.

They also kept me fully updated on their progress throughout the week.

Last time I had my RV in a "big box dealer" service center to fix one minor stair issue they had my RV for a month without completing the repair... These guys fixed that and multiple other issues, at a very reasonable price, in 4 days.</review>

Over 10 years ago I needed car repair and went through the yellow pages and picked Auto and RV specialists because they were ecommended by the Auto Club.  I have never regretted the choice.  I was really in a panic because I don't know about car repair shops or mechanics.  I have been coming to them for over 10 years at least 2-3 times a year.  They are extremely competent, always polite and accommodating and reliably honest.  I will continue to patronize them as long as possible.  I would highly recommend their work, efficiency and care.< /text>

Have had my trailer there twice and very satisfied with the work. It was done in a very timely manner and they did a great job. Highly recommend them.< /review>

<text>I went here for a strange noise from my car. Was taken here by AAA so I trusted them at first. Charged me $60 just to look at it and then the next day they wanted to charge me over $200 to take my intake manifold off. Thought it was fishy so I went somewhere else and it turns out it was the starter and was a $300 fix. This place wanted to charge me " best case scenario" $550 to fix a problem that didn't exist. Don't come here for car repair.<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c3376c19aee0f1:0xb890c83acdd64d73</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Arranged a pre-buy inspection for an RV I was looking at. Although I'm 1200 miles away, I was treated respectfully and got great service! They were very informative with the items they found, and I paid a very reasonable price for the work they did. I'd use them again in a heartbeat!< /review>< Pics>

<user_id>114104610499882974544<//user_id><Resp>None</Resp><text>Our car stared having major issues all at once to the point where we found it unsafe to drive. Upon arriving at the desk we start telling the large man about all the issues, the phone rings and he quickly cuts us off to answer it. It sounded like a customer was curious about their cars repair progress, this large man quickly snapped off on them telling them its a large job and it'll be done when its done and quickly hung up(he might as well told them to f off). He then allowed us to continue speaking.... He told us that he will set an appointment for a few days and to come back. We asked if we could leave the car on their spacious lot, he told us no because they didn't have the space, he wasn't willing to compromise after implying our car wasn't safe to drive.  We aren't even going to bother bringing it back, I'm sorry but this is a customer service based economy, I hope the people on the phone that day write a review too.<//text></record>

VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!

These guys did a AAA used car inspection for me, after paying and having the inspection done, they promised to send me the results by email before I drove for 6 hrs to buy the car the next morning. The email never came, I never got a call, and now I am buying a car I know very little about, with a 90.00 inspection I paid for and never recieved.<//Text>< username>

<text>Great business. Very professional. Always informative and honest. I was getting ready for a camping trip and my friends motorhome had some issues just as we were leaving. We took it right over to RV and Auto and they fixed the problems right on the spot. We were all on our way in about an hour. Never have I been to a business where they go out of their way to resolve an issue so fast and make sure you can get back on the road like these guys.

These guys definitely know their stuff. If you need someone to diagnose an issues with a car or rv, check these guys out.</text>< pictures>

In one word,  DISHONEST! They charge you for work they don't do and do work you never needed.  Their own employee admitted this when i questioned him. They should not be AAA approved.  Take your vehicle elsewhere.< /text>

<text>I have been a customer of RV Specialists for several years now, from minor work on my RV to major work (new engine) I've always been happy with their work. A few years ago, my Catalytic Converter went out on my RV while we were on the road heading east. We stopped at a RV repair shop in Kingman AZ and got a diagnosis. The new part was going to take three days to get to Kingman, I really didn't feel comfortable with the shop so I called my guys at RV Specialist and explained my symptoms, turns out that the part the folks in Kingman was ordering was the wrong part. I limped back to Rancho Cucamonga and had the correct part installed in two days. I saved a ton of money and a bunch of time.  I recently had an engine overhaul done on the same RV and trusted the job to RV Specialists, Rob worked closely with my insurance company ensuring that I received the best parts for the repair. Needless to say I was very happy with their service and the end product.  Anyone who owns a RV knows that repairs can be costly, what I appreciate the most about RV Specialists is their honesty, I know that the work being done is exactly what I need. On several occasions they have steered me away from unnecessary repairs by either telling me that I didn't need the work done or that it could be delayed. It's hard to find a really good RV repair shop, and although they can be a bit pricey, it is well worth it knowing that you are getting a thorough job done, and at the end of the day, when you are travelling across the country with your family, peace of mind is priceless.< /text>< Pictures>

Newly opened restaurant replacing Yu Palace offering excellent noodle and Sichuan dishes. It's definitely an upgrade in food quality, taste and presentation, as well as the facilities and utensils. Will return for sure.</review>

Decent taste. Okay service when doing take-out (there wasn't eye contact or estimated wait time). The Sweet and Sour Chicken can have a bit too much sauce, but the food was tasty. We ordered salt and pepper fish, combo fried rice, brocolli beef, and sweet and sour chicken for $55 (in tax, no tip). I would recommend this place for those who can spend a bit more and looking for decent chinese food.< /review>

Very good Szechuan style dishes.  Funny thing is there specialize in fresh noodles.  So can't wait to try the noodles if the food there is that good already.
Just tried two noodle dishes for lunch both very good only issue was missing that special price for portion size, that makes you say I'll be coming back.  Overall both noodle dishes were good.< /Text>

<Review>Very delicious and authentic Sichuan cuisine! The main chef came from Chengdu and has been working as a chef for more than 20 years! Reasonable price and superior quality. This restaurant even has the secret menu which offers some really traditional Chengdu food. Best Sichuan restaurant in Bay Area!</Review>< Response>

< Review>
Spent $25 on dinner for two beef brisket Noodle and spicy beef noodle.the spicy was so spicy the entire container seemed to be made of chili sauce. The the beef soup I had almost no flavor and three quarter size pieces of beef which consisted of Bones and cartilage. Next time I'll just buy a box of top ramen. Is a senior need this my wife's we're supposed to be brisket is that most of it is cartilage or should I say tendon and fat. Bottom line best noodle not best noodle.<//Review>

<Text>This place was a nice surprise. I ordered the beef brisket noodle soup to go. The noodles were really long and chewy. The broth was pack full of flavor. The only thing I would have liked to see is more beef and veggies since the dish is large. The value is good since you're getting a large bowl of delicious noodle soup.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Rating>4</Rating><username>Geri Nguyen< /username></record>

This the worst restaurant I ever went.Poor services.And force you to give 15% tips.I went there once,the waiter didn’t do anything just bring the food and dishes to the table .When I was done I paid 10% cash tips as courtesy.To my surprise the cashier rushed out to ask me pay at least 15% tips.The cashier said your tips didn’t enough.I was shocked because they did not do anything why ask for 15% tips.I said him ridiculously! And went to my car!</Review>

<time>1561860667065<//time><Text>We came around 11:10am for lunch and were the only two people in the restaurant for 30 mins or so. We were intrigued by the inviting pictured of their menu but were quite disappointed by the food.

Pork dumplings: 2/5
The filling was so very dry and tasteless

Spicy beef noodle soup: 3/5
Noodle and meat were fine, but the soup wasn't as flavorful as I wanted. I had to add soy sauce and some chili oil to my liking.

The servers weren't attentive, they were assembled at the counter and were chatting with each other instead of tending the customers.<//Text><rating>3</rating>< username>

We ordered the frog legs, mapo tofu, and combination fried rice.

We ordered salt and pepper fried "flog legs"... We got some type of stir fry frog legs with some of the worst seasoning we've ever tasted. It was drenched in chili oil and was inedible.

The mapo tofu was also incredibly oily and was not good even with rice.

The combination fried rice was probably the best thing, which I would rate a 5/10. Most of the meats inside it were undercooked, especially the shrimp.

Do not go to this place, they have no integrity and have dozens of fake reviews across Yelp, Google, and other sites.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Test is just so so,neither like Sichuan nor Hunan style, and the environment are still old. The most worse thing is the oil for cooking is not fresh since there was a white thin cover on the dishes.Will not go anymore.< /Text>

味道的确很接近我在中国吃的味道。就是价钱有点偏高，和好日本拉面管子差不多价钱，能接受范围，可能在还原味道方面下了功夫。<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I have been going to Ventura Bike Depot for several years, and have always had a great experience. Beginning with the purchase of a commuter bike in 2006 and several bike purchases last year. However, as much as getting a great deal on a sparky new bike is just awesome, the customer service is where this shop shines. I can get a cool new bike just about anywhere.....but....I can't walk into Amazon with my cousin looking for a cotter pin to piece together an old unicycle we found and were refurbishing, explain to the repair tech what we needed, then he rummages through a parts bin, come up with the part, and wouldn't charge us for it because it was just an old part he happened to have. We simply could not have finished that build without it. Every time I've been there, that is the level of customer service I've received.</Text>

Has to be 5 stars hands down. I recommend Bike Depot to anyone I know, anyone i meet for that matter. Their attention to detail, speed of service, selection, pricing, putting customers first, courtesy service, taking time to explain things, great deals... what more can I say? Did I miss any details? Oh yeah- Just checked online. Guess who's the only bold and brave bike shop open on weekends? That's right- Ventura Bike Depot. Man o man there are no negatives to this place. I sound like I'm rubbing it in (I am) but guess what- it's all true. Come by and do a test ride sometime (My brother wants to order a bike online and get it sent in pieces, so I told him to come at least see what's out there. He thanked me after). You'll be glad you tried it too.< /text>

Great shop. Super honest. I dropped my bike off for a tune-up and turns out it didn't need one so they didn't charge me for it. That's amazing. Shop is a little hard to find but I'd take that over any other shop where they put profit over customers. Especially for a novice like me. Keep up the good work< /Text>

Stand up group of guys, pleasant and Covid conscious service.  Had the perfect bike for my needs 5 years ago and today.  Offered follow up break in service with new bike and answered any and all questions I had.  Great shop.

Edit: after getting my new MTB home I discovered the rear rotor to be 2mil out of true, the rear wheel out 3 mil from true, pedals were only hand tight and front der. needed a hight and rotation adjustment.  Would like to see better QC on builds, otherwise great service and knowledge.<//Text>

I was riding a 200k brevet, and left my wallet back at the car. Bad move on my part, but lucky I got a flat near this shop and not somewhere remote - as I had flatted out earlier using my last tube. The Ventura Bike Depot, took copies of my brevet card, contact info, and "trusted" me to pay them the next day.  After sealant in my back tire, and some reassurance I would be good to go for awhile, I set off to complete the ride. This was a testiment to a shop being dedicated to helping a rider out. I paid them over the phone the next day, and will always patronize this shop when I'm in the area. Good will goes a long way.</Review>

We love this place!  We visit every year from Texas and always rent bikes from here.  Every one here is always very kind and helpful, we have never had an issue! Quite the opposite they are always more than helpful to us.   Ventura Bike Depot is also located very close to bike paths that lead you straight to the beach, you can park and launch very close to where you get your bikes if you plan to ride to the beach from there.  They keep their bikes in great shape so there are no problems at all.<//Review>

I shopped all of my local bike shops for a bit of advice (validation mostly)on bike fitment issues that I was having with my current road bike. I was commonly met with the standard, "it's gonna cost..." with prices ranging from $50.00 - $125
00. Which is fine. I get it. You're in business to be in business. No problem. But, Wait! What?. I have to wait a week? Really???

That wasn't the case when calling on, Ventura Bike Depot. I was listened to, as in "I hear you". Told that I could swing by anytime I'd like so that my issues could be further discussed at length. Once there, Alternative solutions were offered, discussed, and considerations reviewed, and not once was I made to feel that I was somehow imposing on their time. The end result was a discussion that lasted all of about ten minutes, validation and peace of mind over what I had already suspected to be the most viable solution. And the kicker, "No Charge". What?!?.

The bottom line for this establishment here is simply, " Client first and foremost" How could I not leave my Road Cycle there to be worked on. (Which I did)

If you're looking for excellent knowledgeable service and solid ethos in a company, then look no further. This is that place.</Text>

Professional, Friendly, Competent and Speedy!
I was impressed by how quick I could have my bike serviced without waiting two weeks for an appointment.  I dropped by bike off during my lunch and picked it up a few hours later.  I was also impressed by the willingness to detect the issue I reported and how reasonably priced the materials and labor charges were.  Thank you!  I will be a returning customer!<//text>

These guys are great. I make sure to stop by every time I'm riding in the Ventura area. They're pumped about cycling (any kind) & are happy to help out (time permitting) on the fly. They know a lot about riding in the Ventura area & have great water to share. Make sure to stop at their shop if you're doing a coastal ride!< /text>

Pushed my bike 2 miles to their shop, at 5-minutes to closing, they took care of me, gave me a more than fair price and I was out of their within 15-minutes and they stayed late for me.

Ventura Bike Depot is awesome. Had never been there before today. Was on a bike ride when my handlebars became loose, rode on over to VBD and Shelley was super helpful and tightened up my bars no problem. I was quickly on the rode again enjoying my ride. While at the store, Shelley assisted me with a helmet fitting. When I got back from my ride, I went back to VBD and purchased a new helmet. I think I just found my new bike shop! Thanks for being so great Shelley!<//review>

< review>
I am an out of town grandmother. I knew what I wanted to get both my grandson and son but being @ a distance was tricky. I called around and liked the helpful attitude @ Ventura Bike Depot, esp. Robert. He made excellent recommendations for the situation and totally accomodated my need for a surprise delivery, mid-birthday party. Not only did Bike Depot deliver the bike for me (gratis) but they added some nice birthday bows as well and wrote out a note for me. For some reason my emailed note didn't get through. My son was thrilled and I know that having this bike will be a great "de-stressor" as well as a wonderful bonding adventure for him and his 1yr old, Baby Hudson. The good news is his little 4yr old daughter, can take advantage too. I highly recommend this bike shop for excellent products and customer care which is hard to come by these days. Way to go Robert. You made this last minute idea come into fruition in an effortless way....Big kudos for Ventura Bike Depot. Keatin Holly, Bay area gma.< /review>

<Review>U Sav-Mor paint supplies staff were very helpful, knowledgeable of products, and friendly. They packaged all that was needed to paint my bumper, as well they gave appropriate instructions, and recommendations to get the best results On my paint project. Bill at the service desk was wonderful to deal with. My son loved the trip to our local paint supply shop. Thank you 😀< /Review>< Pictures>

Good prices, good service. Here you're working with knowledgeable, experienced staff who know automotive painting. They'll tell you all you need to do to get going, or if your an experienced painter already, no nonsense, regular prices, good paint and accessories. Best around in my opinion.< /Review>

< review>
Fair pricing, good selection and good service - trustworthy.

I have done business with U Sav-Mor over the last 10 years.  I have found them to be both professional and knowledgeable.  As  a professional painter with experience in technical coatings as well as automotive finishes in restorations, detail is important to me and have found that I can get the information that I need to help me make a wise decision when selecting materials that I may not have experience with or a material for a special application.

I can understand why they ask for paint codes.  For those who complain - just because you don't understand doesn't mean that they are wrong.  Depending on when the car was built in any given year there can be more than one paint color that looks similar - You can't just say I need the light blue color for 2015 - there can be more than one shade that looks similar depending on when the car was built.  They can't be mixing paint based on what you think the color is.  If you are wrong they pay for it not you so they should ask if you have the paint code - automotive paint is expensive.

This store can be very busy and someone who is trying to help multiple people at one time may seem like they are rude when all they are is busy and you just take it the wrong way.  Personally I get it.  Sometimes my favorite person there doesn't have the time and I have to wait my turn,  call back or wait for them to call me back - BUT they always call back!   Maybe some people are the type that offend easily - I am not.

I can buy paint and materials from anyone that I want to.  I have accounts with other suppliers.  I choose to do business with Sav-Mor because they can be trusted.

Beware of negative reviews - I found that looking at a few of the negative reviewers complain a lot about everyone - I think you have to consider the source or read between the lines to see if they are just unhappy people in general with nothing to contribute</review>

<text>Ive been painting ALL my life.  Learned on my own.  I paint better than most overpriced asswipes.  I think if ANY place asks you for a code right away,  theyre IDIOTS.  A real professional will ask you if you are a beginner and if you would like to come in and pick a color, AND MAKE YOU THAT DAMN COLOR. Then ask you if you have a code.</text>< user_id>

EXTREAMLY RUDE, I called, Susana answered and I asked about a certain paint color, she rudley interrupted my sentence and asked for a color code before I could finish my sentence. Then she proceeds to drill me with rude comments about not having a color code.

(This is my first time painting a car and I'm still learning)

I'm assuming the rest of the work staff are going to be mad if you don't know anything either.< /text>

This flower shop is the best place I have ever worked with. They have tremendous customer service and elegant flower arrangements. It was my first time with them today, and I was very satisfied. The online ordering process was easy, they accurately followed my request, and the service was very affordable. Thank you very much for making it so extra-special. I’ll definitely be back!</text>

<review>I absolutely love this little shop! Maria, one of the employees and “my florist”, works every Friday and Saturday, and I see her most every week now for beautiful bouquets and wonderful conversation. You’ll see many of this shop’s arrangement in downtown office lobbies—unique, colorful, and tasteful.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMra6xvDt2fbm592REdzfHS8UQYpRSXCbRCEZtR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOz-ZMYr7P_BxEGPBrige88o1ToLb9nSgLV-PuB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

I found this flower shop online while planning my Jan 2020 wedding. Charlie was wonderful and listened closely to everything that I wanted. Her services are very reasonably priced, and she does beautiful work. I loved all of my wedding flowers, and I would highly recommend this flower shop!<//Text>

<text>Since the flowers in this shop were fresh and perfect, I returned whenever I wanted a large quantity of flowers to give as gifts. It was a wonderful, stylish, and impressive place. Furthermore, the staff was extremely knowledgeable, courteous, and honest, which is why I enjoyed everything in their store. In addition, the staff offers me a discount because I have been a long-time client. Thank you so much!</text><user_name>Sammy Kinney<//user_name><UserId.>109596710085038541329</UserId.>< pictures>

Working with Alice was a true pleasure! She was able to produce such exquisite works of art while still being very accommodating to any improvements that needed to be made in the process. I couldn't have pleaded for anything more! Thank you so much for making our wedding dreams come true!< /text>

<text>I'm so pleased with this flower shop that I just visited. The flowers sent to my partner's office were the right ones, really. Online sites can hardly be trusted, but this shop just blew me away. The flowers are new and everything is very cheap. I will recommend them and definitely call them again in the future for another order. Oh, thank you!<//text><Date>1616953700366</Date></record></dataset><record>

Excellent service, from start to finish! We were very happy to receive two beautiful arrangements of the flowers. It was our first time using your services and we were very satisfied. The arrangement was beautiful and all of the lilies have now opened up and my house smells good. You definitely deserve to be highly recommended!<//text>

From the moment I explained what I wanted, the whole crew was on board and even pitched in their own ideas! The Manager even printed the picture I showed him and wrote every detail down. He had such a positive attitude and I can see why he is a leader. He's a keeper! They provided an exceptional customer service. Great team you all have here! They all guaranteed me that it would come out to perfection and not to worry about it.<//review>

These guys are sweet, and their flowers are beautiful, and their prices are reasonable. You can make your own bouquets - based on your taste and budget - or you can ask them to help. Plus, the vibe is really comfortable, the lighting is right, and everyone is adorable. Head down Albion Alley for this hidden treat.< /review>

Excellent, friendly and  prompt service.  Elegant European influenced artistic arrangements.  Thank you Paradise Florist for creating a gorgeous and special arrangement which my mother is still raving about.  I spent a little extra than I normally do but it was well worth it.  I'm appreciative of the helpful service and the care and skill that created this wonderful gift.  I highly recommend.</Review>

Wow. I was thoroughly impressed. I ordered some flowers for my brother (same day delivery) and they were beautiful. I called today at 10am and they were at his house by 2pm! At first I thought it was a little pricey but when I saw a picture of what he received I feel like it was money well spent.</text>

Paradise Florist has some of the most unique arrangements I have ever seen. I have both ordered and received flowers from them and they have always been beautiful and tasteful. And the best part is that they don't wilt for quite some time after.

I went into the store to place an order right as they closed and they still accommodated me. The order was ready on time the next day. The woman who helped me was very sweet and hospitable.</Text>

They made it super easy to get a bouquet of flowers delivered to my friend.  I just named the occasion, my price point and when and where it had to be delivered, and they did the rest.  This was all over the phone from another city.  I never had to set foot in the store.</review>

<review>I couldn't be happier with the flower arrangement I sent to a nearby hospital. They delivered when they said they would, and the arrangement was bigger than I had anticipated. It was supposed to look like a dog face and it actually looked like a dog face. It was so sweet and the recipient enjoyed it immensely. I highly recommend!< /review>< time>

< Review>
Wanted to treat myself to a bouquet and stumbled across Paradise Florist on Sunday. Huge huge selection. Found a lovely bunch of flowers but was hoping to add a few sprigs of rosemary to it. They happily added the rosemary at no charge and now my whole place smells amazing. Will always come here for my flowers!<//Review>

<text>This is my place to go get flower for any occasion. Great selection of seasonal flowers, cut orchids, and occasional vegetables (yes, vegetables, like in cauliflower stems). Prices are very good as well, I used to go to the flower shop on Chestnut St. but not anymore. Urban flowers are much cheaper and I always manage to find flowers that I love.<//text>< Rate>

The florist did an amazing job. I raced in 30 mins before close before heading to the hospital, picked out one type of flower and gave them a price range, then they worked their magic a put together a beautiful bouquet. I added a vase at the last minute and they stayed within the budget I mentioned and packed it in a box so I could easily drive.<//Text>

Each arrangement or bouquet they make is like a work of art.  When my mother was alive, I used to buy her a small arrangement every other week.  She was always so delighted to receive flowers and plant arrangements that were so beautiful and unique throughout every season.  Paradise Florists offers top notch customer service and they always deliver in the time frame that is specified.<//Text><Date>1464365201534<//Date><response>None<//response>< pics>

Excellent florist. Paradise provided the flowers for our wedding in November 2015, and Jose and the staff gave us beautiful arrangements--they used all the flowers we requested, and even suggested some others to complement those.  Just prior to the ceremony, we discovered that the church had put up some "fall-themed" decorations, the colors of which totally clashed with our color scheme. So minutes before the ceremony, Jose added some red flowers to our arrangements to minimize the clash nicely. Superb work! I'd highly recommend this florist to anyone.</text>

<review>Not a paradise.  Do not order from these people.  Awful experience.  They took way too much credit card information and then still screwed it up and then failed to deliver as promised.  On top of that they failed to communicate the problem until it was too late to find an alternate.

Michael was terrible.

Go somewhere else!< /review>< pictures>

Please do your due diligence if you are considering the oncology department/Dr. Budreckis. They seem well meaning, but disorganization, unreliable communication and a lack of awareness pervade this practice. Regrettably, we continued to give them second chances, believing it was in the interest of our beloved dog Scout to have a local oncologist treat her lymphoma, which became very touch and go as it advanced. One example of their shortcomings follows:

Scout fell out of remission in early November 2020, and received a new chemo drug in early December. It worked like a charm. and we hoped that she could have a few more good weeks, or possibly months. Unfortunately, Scout’s lymphoma started showing signs of recurrence. We brought her to see Dr. Budreckis on December 23rd to get her looked at before holiday closures.

Sadly, Scout continued to decline. On December 28th she was scheduled for a blood draw to run a CBC for her appointment the next day. We spoke to the oncology client coordinator (who was kind and helpful) and advised that Scout was declining. Dr. Budreckis gave Scout fluids. Upon discharge, a vet assistant called to make sure we were right outside AVS, because “Scout can’t really walk right now”. We asked if Dr. Budreckis could call us later as we were concerned about Scout’s condition. We were told that “she will talk to you guys tomorrow”.

Dr. Budreckis did not take our call the next day. In sum, we called AVS early that morning and asked to speak with the client coordinator as Scout was continuing to decline, and bringing her in for a drop off appointment (which averaged 4-7 hours) seemed unwise. The receptionist took a message. A series of conversations transpired, with the same vet assistant from the day before, that kept moving the goalpost and left us scrambling: “Dr. Budreckis has to focus on her chemo patients” (Scout was a chemo patient and had an appointment that day so time was allotted for Scout in the schedule); “Dr. Budreckis needs to see Scout in person” (she examined Scout yesterday - we were told we could confer with her today, at the very least could we speak to her and get Scout’s lab results to see if they were instructive as to Scout’s condition, and determine next steps accordingly? Scout is not doing well, but if that is our only option we would bring her in); “Dr. Budreckis can’t see Scout until tomorrow” (Scout’s condition was declining and we were extremely worried about her); Dr. Budreckis can see Scout later “but only if you want to put Scout to sleep” (an unfathomable ultimatum, we explained that we did not want to put her to sleep, and couldn’t make that decision without speaking to the doctor, getting her lab results and evaluating her status appropriately). We were told we could bring Scout to AVS in an hour (it was now about 4pm).

Once at AVS, Dr. Budreckis advised she was very worried about Scout, based on her labs which showed that the number of unclassified cells in her blood had ballooned to an alarming number, and recommended that Scout be put down at AVS. We explained that our wish was to have Scout’s last moments be at home and fortunately we were able to arrange for an in-home euthanasia provider on short notice.

Dr. Budreckis was well aware of Scout’s condition, our concern about her decline, and surely is aware of the rate at which lymphoma proliferates. Her continued refusal to have a simple phone call with us during regular business hours is troubling, especially given that once Scout was at AVS, it was her lab results that instructed Dr. Budreckis’ advice, which was that Scout’s health was in a very precarious position. We spent our last two days with Scout trying to get basic guidance from her doctor, rather than being able to fully focus on Scout and our precious last moments together. This behavior compounded our anguish and heartache and was not in Scout’s best interest. We hope improvements will be made so another AVS client will not endure such a harrowing experience.< /Text>

Absolutely wonderful place that cares about animals and won't nickel and dime you. We were able to show up with a suspected problem in our dog and get seen immediately. Staff are caring, listen to + address concerns concerning pet medical history. This vet hospital is our new go-to for emergencies<//Review>

<text>They were wonderful. I called on the way there with a critically sick dog and they took him in immediately and gave him care right away. Unfortunately it was clearly his time and we went with euthanizing, but the promptness and compassion they showed through the whole process made it so much easier on the dog and I. Thank you.</text>< pics>

Seriously what a wonderful facility. Took my cat in at 2 AM with no wait and helped her immediately. She was having a bad reaction to flea medication and they immediately took care if it. The best part was Dr. Natasha Gallo! She is the BEST vet I have ever dealt with! She was so reassuring and kind in explaining things. She had us out of there in a little over an hour and the bill was so reasonable ($150 for treatment and pain meds). All of the staff were very helpful and kind, much appreciated!< /review>

<review>This is an emergency vets office and therefore it is better they exist and are open at midnight than nothing else. Don't be surprised, however, if your pet dies under their care. Mine didn't, I'm just saying, with their general level of seeming incompetence--I'm still unsure what was wrong with my dog when I brought him in and am unsure if whatever plagued him when he did enter, can come back at any moment. Huh? Yeah, exactly. No clue how this shop operates, but like I said: someone is better than no one when you're wigging out over a sick pet. Just don't get your hopes too high...</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I did not get any service from AVS, but called to get a price range on a procedure. I was quoted a range of $500 -$1,000. This was significantly less than where my pup was scheduled to get the procedure, so I canceled that appointment and called to make the new appointment with AVS. Suddenly the quote was between $2,000-$3,000!! The person I spoke with was informative and polite and apologetic, but nonetheless I was left having to reschedule with the initial provider and, by then, at a later date. Very annoying.</Review>

Such sweet, kind, professional and caring staff and Doctor helping us say good-bye to our best four legged friend.  Unfortunately, during Covid our Vet was not preforming euthanasia services, and the three mobil services had a 1-2 week wait time.  We did not have time as Griffin was in pain and suffering, we called AVS and they accommodated us immediately.  They were so patient and compassionate allowing us time to be with Griffin as he crossed over "the rainbow bridge"</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I am extremely grateful to AVS for for taking such great care of my pet over the weekend.

My 4 year old male cat was vomiting blood and of course it was on a weekend and our regular vet was closed.

I called AVS in a panic and was reassured that they would take great care of my baby just to come and call on arrival (covid). His voice was so mild mannered and his words of encouragement were much needed and appreciated.

I met four of the staff members during time period and they were so polite and friendly and seemed to genuinely care for the animals and love their job.

The doctor even told me how sweet our cat is..... this is a cat who has absolutely no interaction w anyone besides "his parents" lol. He is very skittish and untrusting so that was saying alot!

My furby is doing much better and although the circumstances were awful, I have a sense of comfort knowing that AVS is open 24/7 and that my baby will be in great hands with staff that are genuine and gentle.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWjEY-bROEbX-k-lycAN4Cosak4rjyfn05Mzuo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e9147ff0966acd:0x86428727873bc885<//Gmap_id></record>

I have had multiple poor experiences with this office and none of them have ended happily.  I have been given one price on the phone and another (5 times bigger) when I arrived there after driving an hour to get there. Instead of listening, they prefer to insist they are right.  The people who work there are more concerned about how right they are instead of helping the customer and assuring quality service.  The doctors may be good, but I've never gotten that far due to the terrible service in the front office.  They are expensive and rude. When I was picking up our Frenchie to take to an LA neurosurgeon, they got multiple things wrong with the pick up, including having her ready at the designated time when we were on a clock to get her to the LA vet in time for crucial surgery.  Yet they held me up, even though we had confirmed time with them in advance, and insisted they were right and everyone else was wrong.  I had to race down 101 to get her to the surgeon in time because of the late service at AVS.  I would never go there by choice due to the rude and disorganized service.  And now, they can't even get the price of a medication correct when they are called in advance of driving an hour there to pick it up.  I ought to charge them for the aggravation, lost time at work and cost of gas!<//review><UserId.>110022187770567111566</UserId.>< date>

These people should not even call themselves vets. All they care about is money. There was no compassion or care from any of the people there.  They made us pay $750.00 up front and when we got the bill it was $350.00.  Instead of promptly refunding the upfront balance we had to go back in and argue with them to get it back. What a scam.</Text>

Whether or not your animal needs to be put down they should have given options and had a 2nd opinion. Despite pricing which is expected many $$$ at this place it was not an ideal place to land your animal, at least in my situation.
The vet knew what she was talking about, and sure you cant prove the xrays wrong but when it comes to handling things up front the techs should be a little more compassionate and give a heads up, there was only one vets assistant that pretty much handled everything so thankful for him, but with 8 others you think there would have been some stability to help your peace of mind.
I was recommended to go here. And be rushed to come in to watch my cat be put down, to "charge" out in a time of crisis and ask me to in the middle of this process and get it all done and over with. All just to come home with a cat in a box.</text>

I'm specifically writing this review for Dr. Barash. We've worked with her for almost a year, and she is the consummate professional. She's relatable, intelligent, compassionate and thorough. All the things you want for your little furry friends when they're in need.

AVS is an emergency vet so they're expensive, but Dr. Barash always keeps our budget, and most importantly, our dog's best interest in mind.

Disclaimer: everyone we've worked with at AVS deserves a shoutout, but Dr. Barash is the true MVP!<//Review>

They called us to pick up our dog at 6.30, it took an extra 2 hours to get him after the receptionist said "we'll be outside in a moment". Waited in front of the door for that long with no explanation or timeline. Overall, it took 7 hours and full $700 to do an x-ray.< /review>

< Review>
UPDATE 2
I tried to heal my dog's blockage up his nose on my own, but my dog had several seizures last night so I brought him to this vet on an emergency basis. Because my dog needed diagnostic tests that this emergency vet has on-site, and I was told several weeks ago that if I'd come in on an emergency basis he would be seen to have such tests, I came back here. The doctor I had last time Dr. Peck, told me that I could not have a diagnostic test through the emergency basis, that I would have to schedule a month out through the internal medicine department. After several conversations Dr. Peck transfered me to Internal Medicine Department who had agreed (Isabella) to schedule the needed tests on an emergency basis. I was then transferred to Dr. Peck who said no, that my dog who has had 3 seizures today is stable and not in need of emergency testing.  Am picking up my very sick dog now.

UPDATE
have my dog at the VCA emergency vet. They have informed me that they do have a liquid form of antibiotic that does not require a great amount of liquid, therefore a viable option. They also have offered which this vet did not, a shot, which is something I didn't even think of at the time, but should have been offered to me. I am flabbergasted at the lack of thought, concern and ability in the treatment of my dog at this facility. After a brief conversation with this vet it was determined that his symptoms were NOT the cause of his collapsing trachea, nor possibly his URI, which will be determined once he improves now that I have the proper medication. In a few days he is also getting additional tests to make sure all bases are covered.  I am so grateful for this help!!!!

My dog was diagnosed with a collapsing trachea two months ago and was having trouble breathing. He also had green mucus coming from the right side of his nose, so obviously had an upper respiratory infection. Everything started out great, they were very good taking him into the facility and took chest x-rays. Luckily the lungs were clear there was actually no sign of great infection in the blood work or the x-rays, so the problem is upper respiratory. I was given an antibiotic in pill form. I called later in the afternoon, (this after a six-hour bout in the morning), to let the doctor know that my dog would not swallow the pill, as he was having trouble breathing and eating. I called twice I was told both times that the liquid form would be too much to take to be practical. I know my dog, I tried to pill him, he was extremely sensitive around the nose and mouth because he is still having trouble breathing.  24 hours later my dog still has no medication. When I called again this morning I told them my dog was having so much trouble breathing he was walking in circles and I need to have the liquid form of the antibiotic. 4 hours later I never did get a call back. I called again explaining I wanted to come in to get the liquid form, after being on hold for 45 minutes and going back and forth I was told they were so busy they couldn't help me until tonight or tomorrow. Really? I am a client who has a pet with a serious medical issue, I was there yesterday, I should be treated before people asking today.. But, no, I am last in line again. On the way out yesterday, the tech dropped my dog on the floor to pick up medications...she went to put him down, his legs buckled underneath him and she just let him go. I saw it through the window.. He is 16 and is oxygen deprived... He had had sedation... It was disgusting. She then came out, put him in my arms and said she needed to take the ecollar off... She didn't loosen it but kept tugging on it!!! She was hurting him but kept tugging on it!! I was powerless to help because I was holding him! She was pulling on his ears.... It was so traumatic for me and my boy.  Not only that, $900 later, I still have no information as to the comparisons of the chest x-ray regarding his collapsing trachea, whether it was worsening, and I have no way to give him medication. If this is ithe kind of service you want, this is the place to go.< /Review>

PLEASE READ THIS!
I would’ve  never,  never taken our beloved companion there if I knew this and have read the honest reviews earlier!
I agree with some of the latest reviews and would give this place and staff,  including the oncologist Dr. B. and coordinator M. a 0 or a negative rating if I could... for the lack of compassion and professionalism, for  treating our beloved precious companion as an object, for the treatment that made him deadly sick, for the lack of the ability to communicate important information and for only caring about being right, for inability to listen and address our concerns... My family and I regret taking our precious pet in desperate  need to this hostile Dr. B. that values being right above your pet’s life.
When I addressed my concerns about our dog’s adverse reaction to the treatment they have given him, they became  very defensive. We came there seeking professional advise and to get the right treatment, but the treatment and the attitude  they gave has only contributed to his premature death
And lastly, they charge 3 times more than  your local clinic for the same procedure<//Text>

My wife and I were visiting Santa Barbara with our pup out on vacation. Unfortunately our little guy came down with a foot infection and needed some minor treatment. I was so blown away by how quickly and professionally they treated our pup. I would highly recommend AVS to anyone and really appreciate all that they did!< /Text>

Our vet, Coastal Mobile Vet, recommended AVS to perform additional diagnostic testing, specifically an x ray and ultrasound after 2 previous blood panels didn't provide a cause to my cat's increasing weight loss.
I phoned AVS detailing my cat's symptoms, our vet's referral, and to ensure they had availability to perform the x -ray and ultrasound required. Per their instruction, we arrived at the clinic the following day at 5am and released our beloved cat to their care. 14 hours and over$1,500 later, I picked up my cat with no diagnosis, and a large cut to his ear while in AVS car.  AVS only suggested further testing, to include an endoscopy and colonoscopy, with their Internal Medicine Doctor, Isabel. It took some effort to reach her, but when I finally did, she said the soonest she could have a consultation would be two+ weeks out. At the rapid rate my cat was losing weight, I told her that he didn't have two weeks to wait and would likely die. Very coldly, she responded, "I am sorry, but I can't help you. Can I help you with anything else?"
With my cat's well-being my priority, I phoned AVS again and implored the on-call Doctor, Elizabeth Peck, for an appointment with Internal Medicine sooner. While she didn't have the authority over that dept., she urged us to return with my cat back to perform a GI Panel--which should have been done the first visit--to check his vitamin levels,  and other potential GI issues. Dr. Peck was very pleasant, compassionate, and empathized with our situation. However, her staff failed to inform me that my cat needed to be fasting for this exam which resulted in yet another visit to the hospital the following day. Dr. Peck prescribed a few medications to help my cat in the interim of the GI panel results--available within 48 hours.

Two days passed, no results. I called again 3 days later and was told they had only "partial results", but to phone again later.
On my third call, I spoke with the on-call doctor who explained she in fact had his results--revealing a strong indication for Inflammatory Bowel Disease [IBD]--and would email the full exam to me.
Hours pass, no email. I phone to request again the exam report and I'm told by the receptionist that she " will get this emailed to [you ]shortly".
3 hours pass, I phone again and speak to "Lisa," that makes a contradictory statement, "I am sorry but we haven't received the results yet". After numerous calls, waiting on hold, I am understandably frustrated which Lisa senses and is offended, she passes me on to another person.
A very unprofessional, ill mannered staff member abruptly told me he was going to "take care of the problem" and he "didn't have any time to discuss further with me" why I had to call 5 times to obtain test results. Before I could even ask his name, he said goodbye and hung up. I had to call back to ask his name so I could inform Management about his rude behavior. I learned that this man named Matt, was in fact the Manager!
AVS does not care about animals nor provide optimal care, and the majority of their staff lack decency and respect.
What AVS does excel in is invoicing and collecting payment quickly. I was charged an extra ultra sound fee on the same day because the staff did not instruct us to fast, and there was food in my cat's intestine. Another staff member said the extra charge was for "squeezing in the unscheduled" appointment--even though I had made an appointment the day before to schedule the ultrasound specifically. The GI panel,  cost another $525 and took two extra trips to AVS because again, no one informed me that my cat needed to be fasted. This test should have been done, admitted by their own On-Call Doctor, the very first visit based on his symptoms.
VCA (another animal hospital), saw us the very next day. Dr. Claudia (internal med) reviewed my cat's history, asked numerous questions, administered a shot of vitamin B12--before the GI panel results were available knowing his vitamin levels were likely low, and  reviewed a treatment plan for IBD. VCA is an incredible place to bring your pets!<//text>

<Text>Bad service. I took my dog there so they can check him because my dog has a really bad rash and it’s red. There was a lady in front of me which they attend her dog and I was waiting there for an hour and a half and nobody came out to ask me if I needed help. So I called them while I was outside waiting and they said “ I’m sorry we are full this day we can’t see your dog” I don’t get it because it’s 24 hours.</Text>< pics>

<Review>Wow!!! I cannot stress how amazing these guys are. Our dog had a foxtail embedded in his shoulder, and we were too nervous to take it out ourself, but were also hesitant to visit our vet after hearing horror stories of the vet bills from foxtails. We decided to try the 24 hr vet and it was the best decision ever! The staff was incredibly friendly, and they had his foxtail removed in under ten minutes. Also, they were unbelievably affordable, they saved us literally hundreds of dollars had we gone to our primary vet. Overall it was probably one of the best experiences we have had with the vet, not only for us, but also for our dog. I would highly recommend Advanced Veterinary Specialists to anyone in SB.</Review><Resp>None</Resp><date>1590089838918</date>< GmapID>

I have used this vet previously snd had an amazing experience. I have had mastiffs for twelve years. When I needed to help one of my guys cross over the bridge the staff was compassionate and helpful in the most loving way
This past Monday another of my mastiffs needed their assistance. This time the experience was quiet different. It felt like the staff was confused and had to keep explaining our plan. The dog weighed 160 lbs and was suffering so i wanted to have him treated in my truck again.  I had been told after several phone calls that they could hold his body overnight so i could take him to the humane society myself. It was after 6 by the time we got started. And I’m on a fixed income. After struggling with the assistants they finally got the iv in and the dr then came to administer the meds. We were then told they could not hold him. I did not react kindly as my nerves were shot. They then agreed to hold him overnight. Then as we were finishing our goodbyes they said they were going to move him. They laid him in the ground outside there back door as the other dog with me looked on ears perked.  It was awful , even the humane society covers their dogs with blankets. I strongly suggest you do the same. Have a little bed side or truck side manner and take an extra step , it may save the next person in this position from that haunting memory.</text>

The entire Doctor staff excels in their particular fields and are comforting and intuitive.  The support staff is equally superior taking care of needs before you realize that you have them.  And lastly the place is spotless and state of the art and open 24/7.  It is a true relief to me that they are always there and ready to help with the best Veterinary Medicine has to offer.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

I was very pleased with my first visit to Advanced Veterinary Specialists.
It was late on a Saturday night, and I was so thankful to have them there.

The reception area was clean, neat, had coffee for clients, and receptionist was friendly and efficient.

I was pleased with the fact that the attending Veterinarian was concise, down to earth, and realistic.

The staff took extra care with my pet and I by putting us in an observation room together before release, to ensure his good health and attitude before going home.

I was quite comfortable with the bill as well, as I have had much experience with veterinary care both with small and large animals, and they were fair with their charges.

In my opinion, this is a top notch place!

Thanks for being there for us animal lovers :)</review>

The staff at AVS are truly special people and we consider them family. My husband and I will forever be grateful to the team who helped our kitty, Jada, put her cancer into remission and live over a year happy and healthy. They supported us every step of the way from the day she was diagnosed, through the stumbles along the way and up until her last breath - and they did so with the same love and empathy we had. I cannot thank the team enough for everything they gave us. We will forever be grateful to each and every one of the team who celebrated the successes with us and cried with us when the going was tough. The AVS team is truly a part of our family now and forever.< /text>

Our yellow Lab was a patient at Advanced Vets the middle of last year. He had serious emergency surgery to remove an obstruction in his digestive tract. In addition, he had a portion of the tract removed. After the surgery, he developed pneumonia. A very sick dog indeed. The care he received was exemplary. The doctors were top-notch and their communications with us was detailed and sympathetic. At the same time they were up front about the chances our dog had to survive and completely transparent about the cost of the care. He was there for almost a week and we were so impressed with the operation of the clinic, especially the care he received during the night from the on-duty vets. We've had many dogs and many vets. Advanced Vets is right at the top.< /Review>

The doctors, nurses and reception staff were all very friendly and caring and communicated the situation well.  We brought our dog in with respiratory issues during the heat wave and the doctor thoroughly examined her and we determined best to leave her overnight and reevaluate in the morning.  She left the next day in much better condition due to their treatment.  So nice to know they are there 24/7.  Very clean and welcoming reception/waiting area.  A plus they had children's books and drinks in the fridge for us as we had our 3 year old waiting with us for a couple of hours.  The doctor even made a follow up call the next week to ensure she was ok, which I thought was very nice!</text>

I am so grateful for Advanced Veterinary Specialists. My beloved now deceased kitty Mia, was seen by both Dr Carly and Dr Wells over the years. Whether it was the endoscopic surgery to remove a foxtail lodged in her nose, or treating her for ongoing Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or  later diagnosing and treating her for stomach cancer, they always treated her with great care and sensitivity and always answered my litany of questions to my satisfaction. When the time came to say goodbye to my beloved girl, they helped release her from her pain skillfully and gently, and with great compassion for my grief. They both did outstanding jobs with Mia's delicate issues.

More recently, with my new kitten Sophia, who had to be spayed at one year of age much to my surprise (I was told she was already spayed when I got her!) they did a fantastic job attending to her, and all my questions.

The staff has been equally friendly and supportive. I can't recommend them enough!</Text>

Santa Barbara is very lucky to have this facility and these skilled specialists. Our cat got excellent specialized diagnosis and treatment for a problem that looked like cancer but turned out to be something less dire. Dr. Carly, Dr. Wells, and Dr. Ayl each were very precise and careful, step by step. We knew exactly what the options were, what costs were involved and finally given a course of action that could be pursued with our regular veterinarian. First-rate hospital for our loved ones.< /Text>

They were friendly, polite, and I really can't say enough good things. We were in and out fast and they did a great job explaining any potential followup and daily medication routines. Even though we already have a primary veterinary spot for our dog I am very glad to have another facility we can go to day or night so close to home.

<review>First let me say that the owner, Dr. Andrea Wells is absolutely terrific and we love her.  She is the best kind of vet you can imagine, knowledgeable, caring, terrific.  However we scheduled an appointment with Dr. Sharon Shields, a specialist, to remove an undescended testicle from our puppy, Wyatt.  My wife explained that we didn't want to neuter Wyatt because we live in the mountains and we believe that neutering results in a couch potato for a dog, which wouldn't work in our environment.  We agreed to travel from Mammoth Lakes almost four hundred miles, to Santa Barbara for the surgery.  When we arrived, Dr. Shields said she needed to talk to us and explained that her high ethics would not allow her to remove the testicle without neutering the dog and that if we didn't agree, she wouldn't do the surgery.  We left.  Apparently Dr. Shields high ethics wouldn't allow her to do the surgery, but dragging us all the way from Mammoth Lakes on a pretense was ok.  Then she charged us $185 for the "consult".   We were and are upset.  A lot of stress for nothing.  Dr. Wells apologized profusely.  We love Dr. Wells, but will not have anything to do with Dr. Shields in the future.<//review><user>106423987957658435169</user></record></dataset><record>

We had to rush our mini doxie here in the late evening because her hind legs were not functioning quite right. We called on our way over and was greeted by friendly front desk staff that took Coco in right away and assessed her situation. We were offered beverages while we waited and were assured that Coco was in good hands. My wife and I were pretty upset because it's our fur baby and we were worried. The staff kept us informed and was straight forward about what was going on with Coco and did what was best for her all the while looking out for our wallet. Coco was diagnosed with IVDD and is being treated appropriately. We appreciate this team and if we ever have any emergencies in Santa Barbara again they will be the ones we turn to!< /Review>

I brought both my cats in on separate visits and was extremely satisfied with the quality of care that was given in both cases.  With my first cat they were able to find a large inoperable tumor that our regular vet couldn't. Due to his age, it didn't make sense to keep him going. I asked them to put him to sleep. They were so kind and sensitive to me, I really appreciated how much they truly cared. I received a sympathy card in the mail signed by all the staff. This meant a lot to me. My other cat received treatment at AVS and thanks to them his condition improved and he turned out fine. They gave me sensible treatment options so I could decide what I thought was best for my cats. I would highly recommend AVS to anyone who has a pet that needs emergency services.<//Text>

Dr. Carol Haak is incredibly knowledgeable in difficult cases.  She treated my Maine Coon cat for a very rare condition involving pathology in the vocal folds.  Her research gave us a lot of information on which to base our decisions.  She and the staff are kind, caring, and very, very competent!</Text>

We have used AVS for both emergency and scheduled visits to specialist. They are always impressive, professional and helpful. We are very glad they are available for our two dogs. The facially is state of the art and the staff is terrific.</Review>

In 2013 my Lab suffered a serious fracture of his hind leg femur. The options we were given were: amputation; surgery, with a 6 month rehab that might or might not be successful; or euthanasia.  AVS staff and surgeons provided detailed information, combined with skilled compassionate care of our dog while the agonizing decision was made to put him down.

I reflect on this difficult period and once again acknowledge the sympathetic support and unique expertise that AVS extended to our sweet dog and his loving family.< /Review>

As a first time pet owner this was my first ever time to a vet or animal hospital, the prospect seemed a bit daunting at first as our cat got sick after eating a lily on 4th July weekend, but at very short notice AVS took our kitty in and treated her with the utmost professional care. I couldn't have been more impressed, the staff all seem to genuinely love and care for the animals they treat and are all super friendly and helpful, they couldn't have made our experience easier. I would recommend these guys to any pet owner in the Santa Barbara area, absolutely fantastic!<//Review>

She recommended AVS and he would not be alive today if we hadn't taken him there. The level of care is unbelievable, the staff and doctors are caring and they really listen and take time with you. Monty is now fully recovered and back to his old self. I can never thank them enough for what they did for us.< /Review>< rate>

Doctor knew what she was doing.  BUT, they made a big deal of providing estimates and having us authorize all treatments.  As there appeared to be no truly pressing emergency, I authorized an anti-nausea drug and some fluids to keep my pup comfortable until we could get to her regular vet.  AVS turned around and also administered antibiotics (and charged me for them) without a) knowing what they were treating and b) getting the antibiotics authorized by me.  They had my cell phone number and authorization would have been a simple matter.  I would have declined based on the situation.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>My dog had an emergency surgery due to a bowel obstruction, (due to a dental chew), and my vet recommended AVS.  I rushed my pooch there, and they did surgery that night.  The surgery saved my dog's life.  Everyone there did a fabulous job, from the receptionist to the vet, to the person who cleans the place (it's sparkling). They have all the latest, high-end equipment.  It's not inexpensive.  Hopefully you'll never need them, but if you do, it is the best emergency vet to go to in Santa Barbara.  (There is another - but DO NOT go there). I highly recommend AVS.< /review>< pictures>

This is the most outstanding Veterinary group .  My dog , Mattie,  life was saved as a results of medical treatment and personal care. Dr. Well's and her staff (caring people ) went above and beyond, to save Mattie life , years ago. They gave us extra years with Mattie.
Mattie is alive today and is now having some problems. Once again , we have trusted, our loving Bullmastiff , with the care of, Advanced Specialist. They provide you with the top medical care and equipment.  I did not feel like I was deserting my dog ,in the time of illness. Round the clock care (and love) for your animal, is so important , when they are ill.
I cannot prevent my dog from getting old but I am confident that the care and treatment that Mattie received from Advanced Veterinary Specialists, has prolonged her life. She loves going to her visits.<//Text>

I walked it to AVS with my dog having severe allergic reaction to a vaccine  he received from our family vet earlier that day.  His head and body was swollen and covered in hives.  Within 30 secs of walking in the door they triaged him, within 5 mins he was given a life saving injection.  Within 20 mins I was discussing his treatment with the vet on call.  Two hours later I was walking out with dog on the mend for under $150 dollars.  I could not be more grateful for their quick efforts, their understanding explanations, and reasonable prices.<//text>

They have some successes, no doubt, but our dog suffered terribly due to their poor care of her.  We were told we could visit her any time, but then were kept us for long periods in the waiting room. They did not call us when she started to suffer, and mishandled her juglar vein wrap.  She was in excruiating pain.  We kept telling them to redo the wrap, they didn't listen.  At the next shift change we asked again, finally they redid it.  She yelped in pain and the oncoming vet said that we were right that the way the wrap was done was hurting her.  She went hours in pain and no one would listen to us.  At the same time, she had trouble breathing.  They attributed it to terminal stage of her life.  The incoming vet looked into her nose and found large plugs of debris, that once removed allowed her to breathe.  She immediately relaxed and began to improve with a good sleep.  She suffered a setback the next morning for reasons unclear to us, or them, and finally we had to say goodbye.  If you take your beloved pet to this clinic, you need to be on top of it at all times.  They didn't bath her, but once a day, so their invoice claims and as a courtesy.  Our poor girl had diarrhea and needed much more attention.  Her entire rear become swollen, red and she lost all her hair from sitting in her feces too long.  It is just too horrible for us to think about.  We are only writing this in hope that others will not go through what we did.  You need to be there, and you need to call, and you cannot count of them to contact you or give your baby the best care.< /review>

Not only did they save his life, but from the time we walked through the door, they treated our Coda with love, kindness & respect, just as they treated us.

<Text>My dog had been having continuing regurgitation problems for months in the middle of the night. The regurgitation on my bed had been so bad that I had to cover my bed  at night with protective plastic--so that my whole room began to look like a Dexter kill-room. I had no idea what was causing it.  My vet suggested I go to AVS and meet with their canine Internist there.  She pinpointed the problem using testing equipment that  my own vet doesn't have.  AVS prescribed medications that have brought the problem under control    My dog has something like an irritated digestive tract--and he is doing so much better now because of their recommendations.  The plastic sheets are gone and my pack and I can all sleep peacefully again. (Yup, three little dogs sleep on my bed with me.)  Thanks, AVS.  You were literally my dog's lifesaver!</Text><response>None<//response>< date>

We are blessed to have AVS in Santa Barbara. We were referred there by our vet this past spring when our 10 year old German Shepherd was suddenly and unexpectedly diagnosed with advanced, aggressive cancer. Everyone we met was professional, compassionate and extremely supportive of both my husband and I and our dog, Maggie. They gave us the information we needed and the time and space to process the situation. I was impressed from the moment we walked through the door. The follow up visits and phone conversations only confirmed my confidence in AVS. Though the story had a sad ending, AVS made it more bearable.</Review>

<review>AVS first took care of Duke, my sweet old shepherd husky mix, the summer of 2013, after he got fertilizer poisoning due to the gardeners mistake. He was extremely sick and the vet team eased my mind while they gave excellent healing care to Duke. Thankfully Duke fully recovered from that accident. However, during that exam it was discovered he had an aggressive inoperable tumor. He lived with ease and happiness for 15 months beyond the diagnosis. And, when it came time to make that hard decision every pet owner has to make, AVS was there for us again. Duke's professional ER care that night and the personal compassionate care from each member of the staff, helped us make Duke's passing so much easier.  In my 24 years of being a pet owner, AVS is the best I've ever experienced!!</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80e9147ff0966acd:0x86428727873bc885<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

When my dog, Sneakers was diagnosed with Skin Cancer in at the end of 2013, my Vet, Ohana Pet Hospital recommended I take him to AVS. When I was in the exam room waiting for the head Veterinarian, I was so full of anxiety and stress. The Vet walked in and made me feel at ease immediately by asking me a question and allowing me to talk and let him know exactly how I felt about my dog. He provided me with solutions and options. My anxiety immediately fell away and I could tell that I was in the right place. Great staff! I would highly recommend you come here over any other place. Unfortunately, Sneakers passed away on October 22nd.<//text>

<review>Dear Advanced Veterinary Specialists
I am so thankful that Margie Mason told me if Hank my Boxer (the love of my life) ever got hurt to take him to AVS. This was truly the best place for Hank, he had a complete cranial ligament rupture and had major knee bone surgery. It has only been 10 days since surgery and he is walking on all fours. Happy and himself again. Dr Sharon Shields and staff were direct, friendly , professional and understand of all my concerns. I recommend them highly, and am so grateful my boy is doing so well and we have such a top notch advanced veterinary specialist here in santa barbara calif, thank you.

We were a first time visitor at AVS, this morning at 4:00. Two compassionate people, vet, Jennifer Kingsley, and tech, Lyndon, could not have been more helpful and tender treating our 10 year old Maltipoo who had been throwing up and having bloody diarrhea throughout the early morning. I highly recommend AVS in an emergency. I wish Dr. Kingsley was our regular vet. She and her tech Lyndon make a wonderful team. Lyndon was especially helpful explaining the protocol we need to follow for our dog, Lucky,  Thank you very much.

I took my dog, Kogane, to AVS to see Dr. Ayl the oncologist when my she had oral melanoma. They offered lots of pertinent information and we were able to try a few treatments and greatly increase her quality of life. The staff, all the folks at the desk, the techs, and the doctors were al very nice and you could tell that they genuinely liked and cared about K. I've also heard great things about their emergency care and they are the contact info I give any pet sitters for after hours emergency care.</review>

RE: AVS & The Surgical Team

Just after Labor Day, our Labrador Retriever Appa was playing ball with some friends - trying to be the best, as he does - and he started limping. The limp got worse, so we called our Vet and had it checked out. Keeping fingers crossed that it was just a soft tissue injury, we waited a few more days and it got worse. Back to the Vet - and the discovery that he damaged his cruciate ligament. Our Vet has known Appa since he was only days old, and we trust them completely with his health and well-being. When they recommended AVS for the surgery but warned we might not be able to get in right away, we were ready to wait because we wanted the best for our pup.

As it turns out, I am so thrilled to have come to AVS! Everyone we have interacted with has been amazing, and our Surgery Consultant Denyce has been so gracious and helpful with our neurotic calls and emails about the surgery and recovery process: even having us take video of Appa walking because we were worried about his gait, so that she and Dr. Shields could view it without us having to come down for a visit!

No one ever plans for a pet emergency, but in this instance having Denyce, Dr. Shields and the whole team at AVS to care for our Appa made this whole situation just the teensiest bit less stressful. I wouldn't hesitate to bring our pups to AVS for any of their health care needs - and I love knowing they are there to help in an emergency. Thanks you AVS!<//text>

Advanced Veterinary Specialists (AVS) has helped our animals many times. Our dogs both needed both non-emergency & emergency services and the team at AVS has been stellar on every occasion. Dr. Shields has performed surgeries one of my dogs, repairing both of her knees and helped our other dog deal with complications due to his Cushing's Disease, as was diagnosed by Dr. Wells. At every visit, the entire staff was wonderful, completely professional, friendly, compassionate, and always in good spirits. They care for not only the animals they treat, but also the families that they are part of. I would recommend them to everyone! Thank you, AVS!<//text>

<review>We got to know Dr. Wells and her superb staff before AVS existed, and she set up shop once a week in our vet's office to handle difficult cases that required a specialist's expertise.  We have also had occasion to consult with her at AVS when our cat Bertie had difficult-to-diagnose symptoms.  Everyone we encountered at AVS was superb: knowledgeable, efficient, compassionate and able to communicate clearly and succinctly with laypeople.  It is very comforting to know that the best veterinary care is available 24/7 in case of emergency.  AVS is a Santa Barbara treasure.<//review><Rating>5<//Rating><pics>None<//pics>< Name>

<Review>Arrogant, rude and unprofessional. My experience with the group was favorable at first, until that is I happened to disagree with Dr. Ayl on a minor issue of his staff's miscommunication to me over my pet's medication. Instead of discussing the matter calmly, Dr. Ayl chose to be incredibly rude and hostile. His attitude was that it was "impossible for his staff to have made a mistake", and that I was clearly a liar. Despite my willingness to agree with them across the board - if for not other reason than because I had no choice if I wanted to get any more meds for my dying pet - he repeatedly insisted that they were incapable of making any mistakes.  I didn't really care to talk about the issue and didn't understand his hostile attitude towards a long time client of the hospital. To claim that you and your staff are infallible is absurd and offensive for any medial professional. To accuse your customers of being liars without cause is unprofessional and insulting. To speak to any customer so rudely, especially without provocation, is unacceptable.

When told that treating any customer that poorly was uncalled for, let alone one who had spent over $10,000 at their establishment, and that I did not understand his hostility, Dr. Ayl decided that my pets and I were no longer welcome at the hospital and hung up the phone. And all this over an issue that I couldn't care less about, and didn't feel any need to discuss with him in the first place. Making me wonder why if his staff is so competent and infallible he felt the need to spend ten minutes berating me about how any misunderstandings were entirely my fault and that "I should have known better".  If his staff is so capable, why did he need to pull the phone from them and take it upon himself to lecture me on all the ways in which he was right and I was wrong.  I guess there is one thing that outweighs his greed, and that would be his arrogance.  I am saddened by this turn of events with the hospital, and can no longer trust my animals around someone so negative and disrespectful. Not that I have a choice, as rather than be civil to a client, one doctor there has now decided to make my pets suffer by kicking them to the curb and making me find another place much further away to take over their care. Leaving them without necessary medication in the meantime.  Shameful behavior for a doctor.  From what I read of reviews online though, this is a common problem, among others. Medication and machines that these doctors possess can perhaps help your animal, but if you can go anywhere else for those, I would. No help from anyone is worth the abusive an unreasonable attitude of this office.  Hopefully this review will encourage them to reign in the attitude a bit and start treating their customers with some modicum of respect.

And while I'm writing…. another problem here is that the office deals exclusively in old world solutions to cancer and chronic conditions. The sell radiation and chemo drugs.  We all know that is the past and not the future, and it would be nice to see medical professionals that are at least somewhat aware of other options and have some information to offer.  Real alternatives would be great, like pet formulated CBD treatments, which have been shown to be extremely effective.  From my experience though nobody at this office wants to discuss other options, they're just too eager to get you to sign off up for the $5,000-20,000 radiation therapies they offer.  Business over medicine, which is a dead wrong approach to healthcare.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>Our introduction to AVS came this last Christmas Eve, when one of our cats was in dire health. When we brought her to AVS, they couldn't have been kinder, and soon discovered that she had almost two feet of string in her intestines. Needless to say, they solved the problem, and while it was an expensive surgery and recovery, their level of care was outstanding.

Having a facility like AVS that is open 24/7 and 365 is really wonderful. But now I've learned my lesson - the unexpected is expected when owning animals. Now I really do need to investigate pet health insurance!</Text>< Pics>

Like all ER's, AVS is VERY expensive, and I was very fortunate to have CareCredit when I recently had need of their services for one of my animals who developed a life-threatening infection.

The level of compassion, caring, and competence of AVS was absolutely marvelous. The facility is immaculate, the lobby is nicely decorated and inviting. The staff were all very efficient and kind, and I never felt that my animal was just a number to them. There was no patronizing attitude and NO anti-breeder or anti-purebred vibe at ALL. We felt valued on all levels in a way that was nothing like my experience several years ago with the other local ER, which was so unpleasant that I don't even want to describe it.

AVS is a wonderful addition to Santa Barbara...my only wish is that it existed up in Lompoc, where we live. There is nothing anywhere near here for a veterinary ER: everything is an hour away in SB or an hour the other way in Arroyo Grande, leaving this area completely without. I spent several days driving back and forth with my sick pet to AVS, and again...I sure wish we had them up here!

I hope AVS succeeds, and continues to provide its excellent service and the CHOICE of ERs in the SB area. Choice is good. AVS is excellent. Thank you for the great care, kindness, and genuine concern for the welfare of my animal!<//text>

AVS is absolutely amazing!!  Our 2yr. old 140lb Newfoundland Tonka ingested 60 pieces of highly toxic xylitol gum ( he's soooo naughty and will eat anything!) suffered a severe seizure and was in a coma when we left at 2:00 a.m..  The staff at AVS was "on it" and took all necessary measures to save Tonka's life, I came back at 7:00 a.m that same morning to find my yummy dog bounding around and full of joy.  Tonka spent 3 days at AVS and loved every minute and every staff member there.  I was a little crushed that instead of trying to follow me to the car, he followed the Vet tech back to his cage!

Tonka is in perfect health and I am forever grateful to everyone at AVS for their ER training, medical expertise, and most especially the love and kindness they shared with our family and our 1 ton Tonka!!

Us Morphy's are AVS's number one fans!!<//Text>

My beautiful big dog had almost died. He ended up on dialysis at UC Davis. He had just been released after 4 weeks in hospital; he had a feeding tube and the hole through his neck and into his jugular for the dialysis was just starting to close; it would take time to fully heal. I needed professionals to take care of him during the work day, so he could be fed through his tube, get plenty of rest, water and regular "pee breaks" while I worked to earn the dough to pay his debts!  AVS staff were fabulous! Just what I needed! Very helpful, very attentive, very professional, very compassionate. My J.J. was NOT interested in any more hospital time; he did NOT want to stay without me, so I only took him 4 times. The timing was just right, so I was able to have them pull his feeding tube and, so, was able to take him to work with me, instead. They CARED about J.J.  They understood my angst. They offered to help me/J.J. in a way they usually don't - because they recognized that his condition was a special case.  I LOVE AVS - they gave me safe harbor when I needed it the most. I highly recommend them for your emergency and/or advanced medical services for your pet(s).  THANK YOU, AVS, FOR HELPING ME WHEN J.J. and I NEEDED YOU< /Text>< pictures>

< Review>
We expected frosty king sized burgers and fries and were very disappointed especially for the price we paid. Same thing with the egg roll. For a $1 it should have been at least jack in the box sized. It was tiny! And they serve it with hot sauce instead of sweet and sour?? The poke bowls looked good, i think I messed up by not trying that instead.<//Review>

This place is ok if nothing else was in town but drive a little more east and your get bang for your buck at SUPER KING!< /review>

Teriyaki is good,  but prices go up and portions go down. Damn near $11 for teriyaki. Update: portions are ridiculous now. Save your time and go to Hong Hong restraunt<//review>

I loved getting the poke protein bowl with tofu and their new veggie burger but today's the last day I'm ever going there!! I asked the girl working that I wanted a tofu bowl no other meet like crab or fish eggs, but I realized when I got home they gave me tuna. I called to ask for an exchange or refund but since owner claimed it's an expensive item they said no basically my loss . Yeah expensive food I had to throw away. Check food before leaving but even then who knows if owner will do anything about it. Don't waste your time going........there's other places with better pricing and customer service.... plus it's all just fried frozen food..< /Text>

< Review>
A bit expensive for certain items, but delicious. They have crushed ice for drinks. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and a bottle of water. Large portions. Only complaint is there was only a couple of small pieces of broccoli,  mostly cabbage for veggies with a few big carrot pieces. Water isn't refrigerated so make sure to get ice if you want it cold.</Review>

< Review>
My food was really espensive 20 dollars for two combos then the girl had to seperate the combos because she couldnt add cheese to fries then gbey took cheese put it on the fries and threw it in the microwave my bread on my burger fell apart fries were freezer burnt i wouldnt suggest this place for anyone i wouldnt eat here if someomr bought my food for me. Jolly kone is the best place in towm for a burger i went over there and told them about my experience and they gave me a free burger it was perfect<//Review>

<Time>1620920248457<//Time><name>Allan Chu</name><Text>We had a fantastic time dining at Somm’s Kitchen run by the multitalented Ian. Conceptually the experience is a surprise tasting menu supercharged with trophy wines and liquors. This all takes place at a 12 seat curved bar where you can see Ian assemble each menu item. Ian slow prepares the items in advance using slow cooking, curing, sous vide, etc. and then finishes the dishes in front of you. The food is great but then he uses his sommelier background to pair wines and in our case bourbons with each course. And not just any wines or bourbons, Ian is looking to take the mystique out of the trophy or cult brands (like Bryant Family, Saxum, Sine Qua Non, Stagg) and happily pours these to get diner reactions. The result by the end of the night will leave you in a state of rapture and eager to plan your next visit.< /Text>< Rating>

<text>We walked out this evening thinking only of coming back.   Ian is providing food and wine a thousand steps above anything you are getting anywhere else. Smoked/dehydrated/rehydrated tomotaes were unlike anything else and delicious.  A steak better than any restaurant or home.  Homemade duck sausage with foie gras.  Risotto/raisin pudding and 16 day reduced oranges.  All of it paired with wine you won't have elsewhere.  A truly singular experience.< /text>< pics>

We really enjoyed dinner here. Ian is a great chef and really explains the paired wines very well. Go w an empty stomach and hydrated so you can take full advantage of wine and food pairings! Great way to sit meet new people as well.</review>

We had the best time last with this experience at Somm's Kitchen.  Ian really outdid himself with this one! The 10 courses - including 4 different versions of duck (foie gras, pulled, breast, and sausage), scallops, and lamb - were each expertly tailored to 10 different Absolution Cellars
wines (plus 3 Champagnes).  It is the best on the Central Coast, a must do eexperience!</Text>

<review>I've been twice with my husband. First for our anniversary and again 6 weeks later to bring family last night. Ian and his staff are absolutely amazing and very welcoming. The food is inventive and delicious, but not stuffy. Ian's explanations of the food and wine are fascinating and down to earth. He is more than happy to try to accommodate allergies and preference (my husband isnt big on seafood). If you like good food and wine then hands down this is an experience that should not be missed whether you're visiting or a local like us. There's  no set menu to allow room for new experiments and to vary based on seasonal ingredients. Be sure to plan ahead as he books up!<//review>< username>

We did the chefs table.... Absolutely amazing experience. The man, the myth, the legend! I had heard him throughout the Paso Robles area from other industry and it was truely spectacular experience from the wine to the food to conversation. Blows doors on any other intimate food experience you could have. And BONUS now does liquor pairings with aged whiskey varieties. Blended beautifully with the wine. I am definitely going to come back and bring friends. This dude knows his stuff and humble brag he’s truely one a kind!<//review>

I’m still on the fence on this one.  On one hand I had a great experience wine tasting.   Food was tasty but left me quite hungry.  Had to go eat a real meal afterwards.

Let me explain.

About a dozen of you sit around a long circular bar type counter.  Owner/chef assembles small dishes that he pairs with wine.   Food is not cooked in front of you and is fairly easy to pull off.  Chef claims to have worked at a Michelin restaurant but these are not fancy dishes.

We had appetizers like sliced meats and cheese.  Also a warm soup.   Then came a chunk of salmon and a bit of steak.   Each dish was quite good but did not quite make a meal.  And I’m a small guy who typically does not eat much.

Each dish, however, was paired with a wine.  Wine education and pairing is the real strength here.    We had two kinds of bubblies, whites and reds.   They all quite good and paired really well.   When your glass was empty he would pour some more.   So that part was quite nice.

The seating is a bit peculiar.  Some people get the good seats and get to see what he is doing and others sit on the sides and don’t get much of his attention.  The people who came the latest (the ones we all had to wait for) got the best seats so not sure how that works.

Part of the way through another group enters and they sit in a back room.   Now they get part of the chef’s attention too.

Overall it was a fun experience. There was plenty of good wine to drink, but don’t expect a filling meal.  Would I go back?   Yah, likely, but I’d eat first.</review>

The food is inventive and delicious, but not stuffy. Ian's explanations of the food and wine are fascinating and down to earth. He is more than happy to try to accommodate allergies and preference (my husband isnt big on seafood). If you like good food and wine then hands down this is an experience that should not be missed whether you're visiting or a local like us. There's  no set menu to allow room for new experiments and to vary based on seasonal ingredients. Be sure to plan ahead as he books up!<//text>

Ian at Somm's Kitchen is a master of wines, wine pairings and presentation. A humble and most generous host, he educates the mind and pampers the palate with his extensive wine knowledge and creative dishes.  If you have not yet had the pleasure of a Somm's Kitchen experience , you are missing out on a memorable evening!</review>

<Time>1584464579872<//Time><rate>5< /rate><Review>My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience! I highly recommend this intimate dinner setting if you love wine and food. Ian provides seating at the bar for 14 so we were lucky someone cancelled and we were able to fill their spots. Otherwise, you must make a reservation in advance.

Ian is very knowledgable and thoughtful about how specific wines can be paired with the food. This was unlike anything we have ever seen before and were so happy to have had the pleasure of meeting Ian and tasting his passion through each food and wine pairing. We loved that it was an educational evening as he spoke about each wine and the process of each dish presented to us.

It is very clear that Ian has the heart, passion, and knowledge for wine as well as food and it was really great to step into his world for the evening. This is a must-do in Paso Robles and we will definitely be back!< /Review>< Pictures>

Somm's was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. Ian prepared at least 8 courses paired with 12 to 14 wines. Both the food and wine were incredible. It has an intimate atmosphere, and Ian does a great job explaining both the food and wine, without the pretentious feel that can sometimes come with fine dining. We will definitely be going back. You won't find a better food and wine experience for the money. Somm's is a must stop if you're in Paso!< /Review>

<Text>One of the best dinner/meal experiences of a lifetime. Ian has created such a comfortable welcoming environment for an interesting, modern culinary experience for the central coast. Surrounded by strangers, some local, some from afar, all sitting, enjoying, and learning together about wine and the food beautifully plated in front of us. A modern atmosphere for dinner can be intimidating; Ian seamlessly provides a humble setting while serving Michelin-star ingredients. This is top notch for California cuisine. It's so wonderful to watch a chef-somm smile all night as he pours wine into glasses, informing and intriguing his guests about what he truly cares about, course after course. Amazing night, meal, and company! Pictured is a beautiful orange cooked for 12 DAYS!!!!< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDCIlHWFLmC7buWxWVaGFtVnmvLGjB79VIjMJD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<Text>Where do I begin, Ian is truly a master in the art of all things food. Every dish is tasty and complements one another. Wine pairings are thoughtful and creative. Each dish comes with an insightful, summarized explanation of the artistic process Ian takes to execute each meal. Foodies, don’t look anywhere else. This place is a gem, make your reservations early and plan for a one of a kind gastronomic experience.</Text>< Pics>

I was blown away by how much fun this restaurant is. Dining at Somm’s Kitchen is like attending a dinner party where you know next to know one but by the end of it you’re making plans and are the best of friends. From the moment you walk in until you leave you feel like a guest in his home. Ian has perfected hospitality.

And all while being chef, maître d’, and sommelier. I know of no where else you can find an experience like Somm’s Kitchen.</text>

<review>Go here. Experience this. Seriously. You’ll regret it if you don’t. We started our weekend in Paso here and it was the best food and wine pairing I’ve ever had. Ian hosts a night of amazing food, great conversation, exceptional wine and best of all it was relaxed and non pretentious. Ian is like a unicorn that I can only dream of becoming...he knows good wine and will tell you all about it (already super impressive) and then he comes out of the kitchen with these incredible dishes that take several days to create and you’re just blown away by it all. A chef and a somm? Could you ask for a better experience? Thanks for hosting us Ian, we’ll be back!<//review><rate>5<//rate><Resp>None<//Resp>< Date>

Somms is a “do not miss” if you’re traveling to Paso! We are never disappointed and always delight in Ian’s personal touches and flare. It’s impossible  to pick a favorite out of the evenings fare.... instead we just pick a date of when we’re coming back.< /text>

Absolutely amazing. Every course was expertly paired with a wine. nothing but the finest cuisines and wines were served here. It is an absolute foody delight. If you have the chance to stop here you would be doing a disservice if you skipped it. Worth every penny. Check it out you'll thank me later!</Review>

Somm's kitchen. Be ready for a unique experience!  This is not a run of the mill restaurant. It's a "By reservation only" you and the Chef experience. Be prepared for quite a few exceptional small bites paired with wine from all over the world. It's not a meal that will set you back a few pounds, but you will be intrigued by the personal attention and care given to each dish. Reservations could be a month out.< /Text>

<Review>I was fortunate enough to have been accommodated the first night I was in town. The experience was SO good that, being able to get a seat there the next evening was one of the factors weighing into whether or not I was going to book my hotel for another night. The universe was smiling upon me when they could accommodate me again. Trust me when I say that, this place is an immense bargain at $100 per person.

The evening was like a super fun dinner party, and a sense of community was shared with everyone’s mutual love of great wine and food. I don’t think I could pass through Paso again, without stopping here.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Last night i celebrated my birthday with an outstanding culinary experience in paso robles.  Somm's Kitchen does an 8 course meal with a custom selected wine pairing from the phenomenal Chef Ian.  There was nothing served that was short of spectacular. The seating is 14 people who you get familiar with as the meal is served over a 3 hour period.  Im a full on foodie and i would say this is the best experience I've had.  This rivals or perhaps eclipses anything you'd fine in any major city.  I'd highly recommend you experience this for yourself (don't let the price deter you it's worth that and more truly loook atw hat they charge for similar culinary adventures in San Francisco and Chicago)!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80ecc567f7e71789:0x931fabd7ab7b7890<//GmapID></record>

I can't say enough good things about Somm's Kitchen. The night my wife and I stopped here we were lucky. The owner was serving for us. I let him choose our tasting and boy was I pleasantly surprised. He asked a little about what we wanted, then took over from there. By the end our "blind" tasting I was in love with Syrah. Before walking into Somm's Kitchen Syrah was one my least favorite varietals. They know what they are doing and how to do it.

Be prepared. There are only a few seats around the bar. I will go here first the next time we visit.<//Text>< pics>

Ian is incredibly knowledgeable on wine and food, but has the ability to cut through the technical terms and give you a fundamental understanding of how to identify the grape and assess them and determine what you like (or don't like)
He calls it BLIC...Balance, Lenght, Intesity, & Complexity...
Not enough space to tell you more but if you are ever in Paso Robles CA you have check him out.<//Text>

First time in Paso Robles and happened upon this gem. Amazing Jamon Iberico to start, but the suggested pairing was something I never would have chosen, but unexpected excellence is rare these days and this place delivers. Do think, just communicate your taste and enjoy.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Very special. As good wine+food pairings as you will find. Many Old World gems, a few local wines in the mix, Ian is the man. We enjoyed the limited seating around the bar setup, but if you want a table go to Bistro Laurent or Artisan or Il Cortile. Everthing was 5* so challenging to pick a standout. The duck breast comes to mind.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I love walking into a new situation and not being exactly sure what I'm about to experience.  I love even more walking out thinking I can't WAIT to tell others that they need to experience this, too!

I think if people consider going to Somm's kitchen buying a ticket to an experience instead of paying a bill for dinner they'll get far more out of the ride.

On March 9, my husband and I were visiting Somm's kitchen from Austin, Texas.  We had been in Paso for the first time last year before this restaurant opened, so we were excited to try something new on the square.  We made a reservation about a month before.  When we walked in, Ian told us our spot was at the end of his semi circular bar which had enough room for about 14 people.

Ian greeted us and asked, "Are you hungry?"  We stated we were, and he handed us a glass of a most interesting Austrian sparkling wine.  We had no menu in front of us, wine or otherwise.  There was nothing to suggest what we might be eating, what we might be drinking, how many courses there may be, or even how much things might cost.

I'm sure we could have asked Ian, but we decided we were in for the ride!  For the next two hours we were in his hands as he had us try a local cheese, a foie gras that rivaled that of Michelin starred restaurants, a prime filet, lamb, and on and on...

It seemed some people came and went and didn't stay for the whole ride.  I'm not sure if all the kinks are ironed out there, but it didn't hinder our experience at all.

Each course was served with about a half of a glass of wine...unless of course you drank your wine, then more showed up.  None of the wines were particularly expensive, but all were particularly wonderful and the best paired I've ever had with any food ANYWHERE (and not to get all foodie/wine snobby... but we've been to Picasso, Cyrus, Robuchon... the pairing at Somm's Kitchen was simply AMAZING!)

The whole time we felt as though we were Ian's guests.  He chatted to us about the wines and the food and how he had prepared each thing.  At one point, he stopped and gave us a lesson in wine tasting.  It was taught in such a way that novice and experienced wine aficionados a like could enjoy. Ian is an experienced sommelier who teachers wine classes internationally, so getting a chance to experience this was quite a thrill!

In the French style, Ian prepared a salad between the final course and the desserts.  The salad was so creative.  He peeled the quail eggs and prepared it in front of us.  He carefully cut and placed herbs from right to left and as you ate, the herbs and the flavors increased in intensity with each bite.

We finished with desserts and feeling like we had made friends with our fellow diners and our host.

Our final bill was $250 for the two of us.  Both my husband and I felt this was truly a bargain.  We have paid more for less in the past.

Now, for the "to be completely honest" parts.  I would have liked a menu at least when we left if not to follow at the time.  Ian did say that I could email him and he would send a menu with all the information.  I intend to do that, but it would have been nice to look over it that evening, or even as I was writing this review.

Also, I'm not sure exactly how he decided who got what food.  There was a woman sitting next to me who I ran into twice again in the week while we were there.  Each time I saw her someplace else, she was telling other people that she was upset that she asked for potatoes and didn't get them even though some people did.  She did not like her experience at all and thought Ian was rude.  I thought he was funny and dry.  I liked his sense of humor, but I could see where others might find him off putting.  He's a New Yorker, not a Californian... and he still has some of the edge.

I also heard some complain about the price.   I think ANYWHERE you go 11 courses and 11 half glasses of wine for $125 a person is an amazing bargain... but I understand if you're thinking your'e only going to spend $50 on dinner.. this would be a little rough.<//text>

<Text>Awesome place to have your truck cared for.   I would say washed but this place is much more than a truck wash. They actually care about their job and it shows in the job they do.   I just can't say enough about the excellent job they did cleaning up my truck for me.   And the price is awesome as well.  Thank you and keep up the good work.   I just found a new favorite place to have my truck washed.  I would give more stars if I could.< /Text>< resp>

<Text>Plenty of parking, and while it's $25 per night, 60+ gallons of fuel, or spend $20 inside, it's a safe lot. Also, I park in the far back corner, which is 1/2 mile from the store, so I get a mile walk in every time I go inside.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPL0rdKwxec5_7SG5nsudGyG3PF2-t-7tCJFRKW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Very long lines. No hot food. The restrooms are not the best but they are acceptable for a busy travel center. If you are a trucker, there is no way you can fuel and keep going in your way, you have to go inside the parking lot and is annoying.

I don't like that Country Pride is shut down but the other restaurants are not. Oh well. Can't have everything. If you don't buy anything, trucks pay to park over 2 hours. I love the chapel. Thanks TA. Love you guys. You are a haven away from home.<//Review>

It is not a good gas station and they ask $ 10 (dollars) from cargo van drivers who want to come here and relax and people who travel and come to rest for a while, and they wake you up at night by hitting the hood of your car strongly and disturb you.  Gas station staff doing all this. I do not recommend you to rest here<//Review>

make sure you leave a note on your windshield that you are shopping there. otherwise they might tow or ticket your vehicle. But if you're traveling good spot to stop and take a shower.  If You don't mind waiting an hour. Not much of a selection for food. And fuel  is more expensive than other places.</Review>

<Review>It sure has a lot of parking here but you got to pay for it. The store didn't have much selection of food. There's a taco Bell and a Pizza hut inside, I got the tacos and the shells were stale. The garage was packed which is good for them but not so good for the driver.<//Review>< Pics>

I have been at this truck stop in February of 2020, before this pandemic began! I came here, by mistake, thinking that they had a Subway establishment in this store! Therefore, I was mistaken, since the Subway was long gone! Still they had other alternatives. There was Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and an all-you-can-eat establishment! Therefore, I settled to eat in Taco Bell. I was in a hurry, since I was on a lunch break from work. Therefore, I ordered a combo in Taco Bell, and sat down at the lunch counter to eat. From the looks of it, it is a good truck stop, with several restaurants, and ample of parking for trucks! In addition, there is a gas station on the premises. Thus, if anyone is a truck driver, I would recommend to stop at this truck stop in Ontario!</Review>

As all other TA's, they're way behind times as far as emmenities and service.  Of all the chain truck stops out here, TA is stuck in the 70's while the rest are realizing what their customers want and changing with the times.

<review>I've been coming to this place for years especially since my father is a truck driver and I sometimes travel with him. This place is clean and organized, the food is great. There used to be a subway but it has been gone due to renovations. The only complaint would have to be the restrooms, sometimes they are clean and other times they can be very dirty. Other than that everything is great.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Showers are adequate, nothing fancy. Place is a little confusing to get around.  But good enough to stop at, shower and move on.  Showers are super high priced at $15 that is why the 3 stars.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>I was discriminated against for not wearing a mask, I had to pull my laundry out soaking wet and leave. I do not appreciate the people there being alive.

<review>Not sure what is the reason behind kicking possible (more like a sure $100 spent) customer out of their lot. My wife and I stopped at this so location too tired from being in the car for hours. Five minutes after parking security told us that we had 30 minutes to leave. Usually we stop at Flying Js. Fill up the gas, get some drinks and food etc etc... And rest a few hours before continuing on our trip. Well mr security guy  said we had to leave... Mhhh... Ok 3 miles down the road and Flying Js is happy to accept our business and let us rest a while. Not only good business but safe for us and everyone on the road...</review>< date>

This place pushes too much on mask wearing and social distance. This is completely against our constitutional rights!! The staff demanded customers to wear masks, who died and left these travel stops in charge?? I have a star, but actual rating- negative 1</review>

<Review>Not sure what is the reason behind kicking possible (more like a sure $100 spent) customer out of their lot. My wife and I stopped at this so location too tired from being in the car for hours. Five minutes after parking security told us that we had 30 minutes to leave. Usually we stop at Flying Js. Fill up the gas, get some drinks and food etc etc... And rest a few hours before continuing on our trip. Well mr security guy  said we had to leave... Mhhh... Ok 3 miles down the road and Flying Js is happy to accept our business and let us rest a while. Not only good business but safe for us and everyone on the road...</Review><Name>Manuel de Jesus velarde< /Name>< date>

Lot was huge... thank you!
Fuel islands were slippery with oil and grease....damned near killed myself trying to fuel up, today.

So, 5 stars for parking and convenience, but 2 stars for dangerous fuel islands</text>

Clean, friendly cashier, but getting out after fueling requires going through a gate, getting a ticket, then no markings or directions to exit gate, so you just have to drive around their large parking lot looking for it and when I did finally find it, I could not use it because no room to turn into it. Had to go back out into parking lot to get turned around so that I could use the exit gate. Some markings on the ground or signs would be very helpful.< /text>

<user_id>116606205946561601660<//user_id><Text>Great location at this truck stop. I dislike the fact that if you are only stopping for fuel you still have to go into the parking lot which requires that you get a ticket at the entrance so you won't be charge for parking. The first 2 hours are free without a purchase and 24 hours if you get 50 gallons of fuel. But if you loose the ticket be prepare to pay for the 24 hour rate.< /Text><response>None</response>< pictures>

No signage telling you it's pay to park only. Small bathroom.  $25 for one night, hundreds of feet away from the store. Would have parked on the street in front of my stop had I known beforehand.  Droped my headset, never saw it again. Will avoid in the future.</review>

the truck stop itself was fine, my issue was with the taco bell inside. I ordered 3 burritos without sour cream. They made them with sour cream, not a big deal they said they would remake them. They handed me my bag, told me to have a nice day, and i hit the road. 20 miles down the road, i reach into my bag to find 2 burritos, not 3. I called to talk to somebody about it, being friendly not screaming or anything, when i brought up my issue, I was hung up on. I called back, and once again, got hung up on. Im a truck driver, im in this area a lot. I will never give this taco bell my business again. They charged me for 3 burritos, and only gave me 2. I shoukd have checked before I left, but to hang up on me twice is pretty low< /Text>

Most TA truck stop are great but this one is terrible. You have to stop and get a parking ticket even though your not staying there, drive thru the parking lot that doesn't have any direction signs to the exit. And the employees are not much help.< /Review>

<Text>Not vegan friendly. If truck stops really cared about truckers they should offer healthier foods.  Everything is either loaded with sugar, fried or non vegetarian. Truck stops are one of the industries allies yet they fill these places with McDonalds and Chester's and all sorts of garbage. (SUBWAY isn't much better) Thanks pilot aka loves aka TA of America.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c33570a7e765c7:0x9e53888d28c5f013<//gmap_id></record>

<text>Have been coming to T/A for over 20 years parking for trucks leaves alot to be desired,showers need redone,customer service at fuel desk needs alot of training,as with any truck stop it's over priced,but the food in one of the last remaining restaurants is decent,but again over priced</text><gmap_id>0x80c33570a7e765c7:0x9e53888d28c5f013</gmap_id>< response>

<review>They charge $25 for parking or you're forced to spend $20 in store
If I can I would give it negative stars
The restaurant is still closed
Taco bell and pizza hut close at 10 so you're out of luck if you get there after 10< /review>< rate>

Very good store clean restrooms and showers but you have to pay $20 dollars cash or buy anything for $20 from the restaurants or taco bell or pizza hot or the store for parking your truck. The parking lot is huge so there must be always a place for you.< /Text>

This place is much cleaner than other TA's thought the country. We ate at PIZZA HUT, Anthony took our order and got it ready. He was the nicest employee we've EVER come across at a truck stop. He made all of our food fresh since he had to make 2 that weren't staged. He was so friendly, so polite! I hope he does something great with his life as it's obvious he's a very intelligent young man!
No one bothered us, no reptiles walking the lot. Clean, friendly location.< /text>

Truck stops are one of the safest aand clean and busy places to stop for your needs on your travels. Of course be careful.  But truck stops are busy with people.  Doing their jobs.  A good place to stop on your travels.</Text>

This place is not a good place to stop at all! The employees are rude and think their minimum wage , gives them the right to treat their customers like they are nothing ! Like they own the world ! No wonder they were bought out ! And told they have limited time to make money and get out ! I have spent thousands of dollars in fuel at the t/A's across this country but will never stop here again ! I advise you all to  do the same if your ever in the area do not stop here! Parking on the street and living in a tent is a much better way of life than being treated the way these people treat there customers ! This is no reflection on t/A's around this country just this establesment!!! Google maps will find you a better alternative!!</Text>

<text>Parking was a nightmare, took 14 hours to get into the shop and 4 hours for the repair (thermostat). Food on the buffet looked like someone cleaned out the refrigerator...but the staff were friendly.  The food at fuel island was great.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Not nearly as nice as it was a few years back, but still one of the best truckstops in the area. Good food options, fairly clean. Restaurant buffet was tasty , and waitresses are very accommodating and friendly. Security guards seemed a little sketchy, and I would prefer to pay less for parking.<//Text>

Never go here for a DOT inspection. Voiced some concerns over them telling me that my truck needed a lot of work done to it as I had it inspected before the blitz. I said that I needed pictures and a detailed estimate before they did any work. The service tech on duty refused and said that his GM said that they would rather not because of trust issues. Made contact with corporate and they told me that they had never heard of the person I was told was the GM. This same location told me that I was missing 40 feet of reflective tape on a straight truck. Really?!< /text>

PROS:

i have met good people here. Friendly people.
The food is always good. The waiting staff is always friendly. But also you have Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Subways as  For the price of $13 or points off your Ultra Once card, not being picky but presentation matters.</Review>

Staff was friendly. I felt very safe late at night  sleeping in my vehicle knowing security patrolled the property. Sure saved a ton of money by not going the hotel route!< /text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>Never go here for a DOT inspection. Voiced some concerns over them telling me that my truck needed a lot of work done to it as I had it inspected before the blitz. I said that I needed pictures and a detailed estimate before they did any work. The service tech on duty refused and said that his GM said that they would rather not because of trust issues. Made contact with corporate and they told me that they had never heard of the person I was told was the GM. This same location told me that I was missing 40 feet of reflective tape on a straight truck. Really?!<//review>< pictures>

Lots of food choices, large parking lot. Paid parking for the whole place. Staff can be very rude.</Review>

To many people.  Get here early for a spot. Parking is paid.  Typical food. Security needs to tow all the dropped trailers in the yard. Security needs to do something about  the bobtail and kick out the campers taking truck parking<//review>

Bobtail over to do my 34 hr restart. Out of hours when I got there, $20 to park is rediculious. So I parked up front, open area. Was told o have to park in back and pay. "We feed our community " well trucks feed the country and I feel disrespected. Used to love TA until I found out that they charge truck drivers to oark. Although large parking area, they should charge 4 wheelers too. They stop there too. Let's see them lose money over that. Will never go to TA again, anywhere. Loves, pilot and flying j for me</text>

<Text>Just another ta but a little better than most. The water was hot and wet so I got clean. The food was Industrial but I got full. And the lot is huge so I found parking. The three primary things as an over-the-road truck driver or fulfilled. As for pay to park, spend a little money and it's free. To the guy that complains about it and said he would never be back, look at it this way, if they didn't charge you to get onto the lot it would be full of local drivers because there are not a lot of truck stops in the LA area and you might not find any parking. I recommend you get over yourself.<//Text>< Pictures>

Zero stars! At least try to pretend you like your job!!! Some people couldn't even tell you why they showed up for work! These big truck stops are criminal! Price gouging truckers and we're the ones who bring this s@#! for them to sell (rob us for!)!!!</Text>

Big truck stop in the L.A. area. Two hours free parking then after that it's $20 for an overnight stay or $25 spent in the store or $50 in the repair shop. They have a restaurant, a Taco Bell, and a mini Pizza Hut.</review>

$20.00 to park
Be smart a reserve a spot. It's only 13.00
You can save 7.00
Seems like there taking advantage of the truckers, who are forced to stay in this area.
I know there's away around it, but I'm guessing all the other major truck stops are putting a hurt on their fuel sales.

Plus TA's points system sucks!!!!
No free coffee and it take forever to add up enough points, for any savings.

Wish I didn't have to stay here!!

For the food. I'm scared to eat at Petros or TAs

Be smart a reserve a spot. It's only 13.00
You can save 7.00
Seems like there taking advantage of the truckers, who are forced to stay in this area.
I know there's away around it, but I'm guessing all the other major truck stops are putting a hurt on their fuel sales.

Plus TA's points system sucks!!!!
No free coffee and it take forever to add up enough points, for any savings.

Wish I didn't have to stay here!!

For the food. I'm scared to eat at Petros or TAs

All about the almighty dollar..make expediters in cargo vans pay 10.00 upfront in front or on the side of the restaurant. Maybe should make the homeless pay too or run them off..< /Text>

Just stopping for the night. Having to pay for parking is ridiculous. This place makes money hand over foot before parking. Too much Capitalism went to your brain 👎<//Text>
