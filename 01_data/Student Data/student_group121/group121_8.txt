Just left Staples after talking to an associate (Skylar?).  He was very helpful in helping us select a printer.  I wish all associates were this helpful. The workers at the Hemet location were downright rude. We will definitely make the drive to come to this one in the future.<//Text>

<user_name>Folievue<//user_name><text>Luke was one of the most helpful cashier I’ve ever experienced. He truly enjoyed his job and made sure that my exchange was easy and worry-free. I had tried to make an exchange several times before, and Luke was the only cashier who was able to make the exchange. He has improved my opinion of my local Staples and truly made it one of my top places for school supplies. I’d recommend this store, mainly because of Luke’s amazing customer service. Can’t wait to go back next time.< /text><rate>5</rate></record>

I went in to make a simple photo color copy of a picture.  Not only were they incapable of pulling up to the photo through email without distorting it, but then they said the only way for me to have it done was to use one of their computer terminals which I needed to pay to use per minute on top of the dollar charge for the color copy.

Staples is dying, let them die.</text>

Had everything we needed and the staff were friendly.

As a brick and mortar I understand that it is expensive to staff and stock, but the store felt barren and quiet. I had to wait in the checkout line to ask for help finding something I needed and there was no floor staff available to assist me.</text>

Clean store with adequate parking. Friendly staff and management. Convenient location on Madison avenue in Murrieta. Great place to start your adult coloring-book hobby; with lots of books and pencils to choose from. I wish I could drive along the strip-mall front over to the Big Lots store, but you need to get back out on to the avenue; please consider building an easement across the culvert for a boost in business traffic.</review>

If I could leave the stars blank I would. Shari was quite snappy and got my blood pumping sad to say, but I kept cool. Really both of the ladies at the office service desk were quite unprofessional. To make a long story short they were limited compared to Office Depot and got out as soon as I could.</text>

<Review>Next to Best Buy - somewhat different business model. Needed SSD drive to replace my Laptop HD. Had to get at BB since they have bigger selection. BUT - talked to 5 folks for help in BB without getting simple questions answered. Called Staples - unfortunately not in stock. Went into Staple to ask about SATA cable and cloning. No problem they knew exactly what I was talking about; spent time answering questions. They also had the price/configuration if I wanted to get a new laptop. Shop Staples for great help and then go online.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>This store needs to make sure that the prices on their selves are accurate. I purchased ink toner and they charged me way beyond to what the actual price. Good thing I check their websites and bam! Their prices are way off. I Went back to the store to have it adjusted and the person who help me seems very unhappy about it. I told her who ever does their price accuracy needs to get on top of it or else they are overcharging their customer without their knowledge and it is not cool. So beware shopping to this store. Go check their  website first and if you can purchase it online do it and they have 1 hour pick window. This store might be in violation of Business and Profession code- BPC Division 5. I wont be shopping to this store again.<//text>< Rate>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>So my 14 year old son saves up his money to purchase a screen for an old iPhone 6 Plus I had on 11/24/2017 (I had upgraded to the IPhone X) the IPhone 6 Plus I had however needed its screen replaced, as I mentioned, so he got the screen replaced for his new phone with his hard earned money at our local Staples, that was the only catch so I gave him the phone and the phone line. He went to Staples and paid $139.99 for the screen replacement from this place. He ended up getting a 20% discount for being Black Friday. He also purchased a Heavy Duty Outter Box to protect his phone at same time that he got his screen replaced from this Staples location and the same guy who replaced the screen ended up putting it in the Outter Box for him right after he replaced the screen at Staples, my son never touched or inspected the phone before having it put in the case from the guy (We have the receipt for both purchases as well time stamped) So here we are two weeks later and his phone is having issues so we take it to Staples to let them know about the issues and the General Manager, Scott Burnosky, receives my sons phone and asks for my son to take it out of the case which he does and we give it to him. The General Manager, Scott Burnosky, looks at the phone and does not say one thing about any cosmetic issues with my sons phone at the precise moment that he inspects my sons phone. He then proceeds to take my sons phone and says he needs to wait for his technician to replace the screen which comes in at noon. Well at this point Im expecting to get a phone call at 12:30 or 12:45, well I receive a phone call at 2:00 PM two hours later?? Then a guy by the name of Dustin proceeds to tell me, first words out of his mouth, you left your phone here for a replacement but it has a small hairline crack so it's not covered? I'm like what? I tell Dustin the timeline of events and let him know we didn't see any hairline crack nor did his General Manager, Scott Burnosky, either or any issues for that matter when we left phone, I also tell him that the phone has been in a case the whole two weeks he's had it, he then becomes sarcastic and says just because you have an Outter Box you can still crack phone! Really!! He states that he will call me back and see what he can do but it's not covered and very direct. He calls back at 2:34 (30 minutes later) and says we can give us a discount if we’d like on a new screen but they can't warranty it?!? I tell him I will be down to talk to the General Manager, Scott Burnosky. I drive down with my son to Staples and when I arrive the General Manager, Scott Burnosky, tells me that the phone had a hairline crack so he can't replace the screen. I explain that why he didn't mention the crack before I left it with him? He states he didn't see it, I also ask him how much would the replacement be he says $160 (that's $20 more then we originally paid before the discount the first time) but he can give me a 20% discount on that??? (To replace this screen it's $150 at Apple for an original btw) Seriously I told the General Manager, Scott Burnosky, how can you take advantage of a 14 year old boy this way? You're asking him to pay over $260 in less then a month for a screen, not to mention the $60 case he purchased from your store, and he's never dropped the phone nor has he taken it out of the Outter Box and you never mentioned a crack! Now there’s a crack? Way to take advantage of a child Staples! I’m not going to have my son give you crooks his money I’ll just go to Apple and do it right! **Buyers Beware of this Sleazy Run Place**</Review>< Resp>

< review>
My wife and I just had a great experience with Jeff at Dyno Auto. From the beginning Jeff was professional and responsive on the email and text messages. When we came in to actually look at the car he was willing to show us multiple vehicles but the same time really asked us questions to make sure that we're getting what we needed and was also within our budget. They were firm but fair with the price even with a little negotiation. We walked away with the car that we wanted at a fair price and a good experience. Well done Jeff and team!</review>

<text>I purchased a 2013 range rover evoque with low mileage from Dyno and from the beginning, working with Robert, was a pleasant experience and no pressure sales. Car was exactly as advertised and beautifully maintained. Financing was quick and easy and Robert explained everything in detail on the contract. I would highly recommend coming here first for quality, well maintained vehicles before shopping elsewhere.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dcd40adeaa9fb9:0x87b7e044b512c15< /gmap_id></record>

<review>It was time to trade my clubman back as the lease was going to be up in a couple of months. I started my search and looked at about 5 mini dealerships. Finally narrowed it down to two that had the exact same car with same options. Price was basically same but the one dealership the salesman was very slick and talked on and on about the great deal I was getting. Dyno Auto was instead very straight forward and honored the price I saw in US World Report and even kicked in some other incentives . The transaction was seamless. Collin and Mikey were great to work with. Collin drove the car to my house and we signed paperwork at a social distance with our masks on. I took possession of my new car and he drove off with my old mini.< /review>< pics>

AMAZING ALL AROUND!!! We decided to follow up on a vehicle that was already a good price w great added extra features, provided from the company. But reviews are imperative to me. So after reading we reached out. Every single person we interacted were so kind! Starting w Eric from test driving, sending pictures, communication, excellent!  Then working w Robert w paperwork, questions, concerns and the rest of what comes w buying. Both were just incredible and very easy to get in touch w. Finalizing everything, we ran into an issue w the second key we were having made. The owner/manager (not sure exact title) I believe Gabriel.  Without a blink of an eye or trying to make us take care of the problem he dealt with it instantly!!! Nothing out of pocket from our end. I can’t say enough. Great people, hard workers, dedicated team. GREAT MANAGEMENT! We drove from San Diego area and absolutely worth every penny. Easy drive as well. Will definitely be back when it’s time for our daughters vehicle!</review>

I filled out a finance application on their website and the manager/ sales person Robert called and told me I got approved. He asked for me to send him a photo copies of ID and SS card I sent those to him via email and I never heard from him again. I tried to call but the employees would say he wasn't there. I'm not sure what happened but I ended up finding the exact same car I wanted from Dyno at another dealership and the car was cheaper and lower miles and I'm happy with it. I also noticed the car that I wanted from Dyno had got reposted online for sell again recently.<//Text>

I inquired about purchasing a Rav 4 XSE the night before, and scheduled an appointment to see the vehicle the next day. Ed Cortez was very professional, having the vehicle ready to view and test drive right as we arrived at the dealership. Ed was very informative and honest with the pricing making my first time new car buyer experience fluid and seamless.<//text>

Gabriel was very quick to respond to my inquiry. I made an appointment. Upon my arrival, my car was sparkling clean and ready for me for viewing and test drive. Jay thoroughly explained the best payment options within my situation. Once decision has been made, they held my hands through the whole process with such patient and awesome attitude. Gabriel made double, triple sure all the documents were accurate and in order and had me back home with my beautiful new car.

I want to thank Gabriel and Jay for making my car buying experience painless, easy and super enjoyable. I will be your lifetime customer!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dcd40adeaa9fb9:0x87b7e044b512c15< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Today was a good day, I finally was able to buy the bmw I wanted and this was possible thanks to Gabriel, he make it happen so easy and what I really like from him was that he look to diferente options to make it happen and the most important thing for me was that he is a men of his word. What ever he promised you he will make it happen no matter what and that tells a lot from a person. THANK YOU GABRIEL thank you to make it happen , you got yourself not justa a new customer you got yourself a friend.I will definitely recommend you to my friends.< /Review>

Thank you Gabriel for a honest experience at your dealership! My wife and I was searching for a Range Rover and you had several to choose from! I will surely recommend you to anyone who is looking for quality cars! I'm considering the Audi or maybe one of the many Range Rover in your inventory!</Review>

Cars are over price and they ask to much down payment.  For what they ask  you guys have more choices out there. Neighbors bought a car from them n six months after they don't want to help n fix. They want your money only  💰  they are not honest .</review>

Dyno is a fantastic dealer to work with! Gabriel was very professional and responded quickly to all of my questions. The purchase of my 2009 C63 AMG went flawlessly and I highly recommend Dyno to anybody seeking a high-end, quality vehicle. Thanks, Dyno!</text>

{'time': 1587695324482, 'text': 'Good Afternoon,\nWe are sorry for your recent frustration and experience with us. When you brought your vehicle in for an appraisal, we noticed, and also showed you, that your vehicle does have a "STRUCTURAL DAMAGE" report on the vehicle history reports we run which we can also upload a picture showing as proof of the report. We did mention to you that you would probably be able to get more money selling you vehicle private party but even with the report showing "STRUCTURAL DAMAGE" we made a fair offer on the vehicle after saying we would much rather not purchase your vehicle due to the report. We take pride in our inventory along with our customer service and strive on providing each customer with the best customer service possible. We are sorry if you feel that we were rude, but we were more than generous on the price we offered for your vehicle and also showed you proof of the vehicle having structural damage. If you have any further questions in regards to this matter please feel free to contact us.'}</Resp>

<Review>My dog has had a recurring issue with raw and bloody cysts on his foot that have required surgery twice due to the risk of serious infection, and unfortunately he developed yet another one on Saturday. After being unable to get him any assistance for two days due to emergency vets being booked solid, I called here to try and get him looked at. The receptionist told me that I would have to wait three weeks to have him get checked out or that I'd have to wait over a month for surgery if he needed it. That obviously wasn't going to work, which is fine, but when I attempted to ask for advice on treatment the receptionist hung up on me midsentence - presumably because I wasn't willing to wait three weeks for an examination.

I understand that COVID has affected a lot in the way businesses are run and that vets in particular are pretty slammed right now, but I can't in good faith recommend a vet with a staff that treats anyone like a statistic.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

At first they seemed to really care but then the doc prescribed 2 meds that should not be given together for my dachshund and she ended up with a painful stomach ulcer. I even brought her in because her stomach was big and hard and she was hurting and I was told she was fine and that's it.  This is after the assistant had cut her nails horribly. Some still long and others way too short. Very very disappointed and upset...</review>

They have been my families Vet for as long as I can remember. I never met a vet that has cared more about the animals than Dr. Greene! She will do everything she can possibly do to help your pet and the staff is great, very caring and loving too. Can't say enough good things about them.</Text>

Dr. Greene at Buena Vista Veterinary Clinic is the best vet I've ever been to. She's personable, informative, gentle and unrushed, answering all my questions. Her staff are friendly and efficient, too. The no-frills office is clean and comfortable.
I took my 7 month old kitten there for vaccinations and neutering. It was his first visit to the vet, but he was calm and cooperative throughout, I believe because of the kind, competent treatment he received there. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and Dr. Greene at Buena Vista Veterinary Clinic will be my Kitty's vet for life!</Review>

do NOT go here!!! stay away if you love your pet.
they made me wait an hour after my scheduled appointment
they don’t answer the phone
they saw other animals in replace of my kitten
i waited 4 & 1/2 hours and they said “oh we haven’t even got to the cat.”
so my kitten was sitting in her crate for hours.
she was covered in bugs and her crate had bugs all over. they said to come tomorrow but that meant i would have to starve her all over again 2 days in row??<//review>

With anything there is nothing better than a recommendation from someone else. I was refered to Buena Vista Pet Clinic by another pet owner while my car was getting new tires. I have 2 dogs and both needed multiple things. Rabies vaccination teeth cleaned and removed. One had a hernia and needed her ears cleaned. I was so afraid of how much it was gonna cost but I had to get it done. The vet techs are amazing.kind, sweet, patient people...The Doc is a sweetheart who obviously loves animals. I highly..HIGHLY recommend this clinic. I ended up spending the same amount for both dogs as I was quoted for just one. You will not regret putting the care of your pets..your babies in the hands of Buena Vista Pet Clinic....</Text>

I have been taking my fur babies to Dr Green for 10 years or better. I’m going on my 4th baby because my others were elderly dogs. But she and her staff are unbeatable and everyone of my animals have loved them unconditionally. I’m so excited to be able to return to my favorite vet and her staff!!!  BeverlyLaRock<//review>

<Text>This place is no good. We just came in today for our dog she hasn’t an infection... they made us wait an hour. I used the restroom and it was gross. And at the time when we were about to go in for my dog, the said for me to reschedule because they wanted to get someone else’s lizard that barely came in so they just made me and my dog leave. I rate this place 0/5 but it won’t let me put that.<//Text>< GmapID>

If you are looking for a Veterinarian, bring your Fur Babies and Exotic Pets to Dr. Greene. She is one of the best in Hemet Ca.
I have been taking my Cat here for quite a few years and am very pleased with
Dr. Green. Without her I would have lost my Fur Baby. Thank You Dr. Greene. You're the Best!< /review>

<Text>We've taken our adopted furry babies to Buena Vista Pet Clinic for years!
Dr. Marla Greene is very knowledgeable, takes a genuine interest and concern with every animal she meets and has never lost her enthusiasm!
She & her staff carefully explain recommendations, whether for that visit or a future visit, and we never feel pressured to accept all or any of the services offered.

Adorable Halloween 🎃 and Christmas 🎄 decor, and a sign from their office, showing just how caring they are 😊🏥🐕🐈🐾

Some pics of their building as our furry baby Coral was getting a checkup, just after sunset and because I love palm trees🌴<//Text>< pictures>

Absolutely 100% terrible and will avoid at all costs in the future. I had an appointment and they still had me sitting there for well over an hour just to get my dog seen. By the time we got out of there we were about at the 2 hour mark. Outrageous. From talking to the others in the waiting area this is completely typical of this business. The woman at the front desk with glasses probably in her 50's also has a nasty attitude for no reason at all. My advice, go anywhere else if you can help it.</Text>

<Text>Very pleased with the care I got there for my little Snake Sophia, Who hasn’t eaten in a while and I went to a reptile store they told me she was getting ready for a late hibernation but without seeing her right now. Went to see Dr. Green and she was very kind very informative, and we found out that she had a little sores in her mouth which of course in fact it would keep her from not eating so now she’s taking medication twice a day and she So sweet and pretty much allows us to do anything we want to tell her best Snake ever. Going back for a recheck on Friday hoping she is doing better.
Sincerely with great thanks Kelly Morton<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Marla Greene is a wonderful veterinarian! She is enthusiastic about her job and cares about her clients and their pets.
She even stayed after hours to inspect my daughter's hamster and sign a form for her science project for free! She is just a great person, and we are very lucky to know about her!</review>

<time>1499301623349</time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>I took in a stray who needed medical attention. Dr Green saw us immediately. She was knowledgeable and gave me options. We are currently saving him, and it is a burden, but she helped when no other vet seemed to be able to. Quibble about wait times (likely this animals emergency she squeezed in put you off your schedule, sorry)  and staff (I would have liked to hear the staff's side) but she helped me when others wouldn't.  Does that count as a good vet to You? It sure does to me</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Date>1487007894171<//Date><text>I went there the first time to get my old dog vaccinated. Short wait, but afterwards I needed the records faxed somewhere and they wouldn't. They told me to just show the receipt to whoever needed proof of his shots.

Took my dog there today, first thing in the morning because he had been yelping in pain whenever he stood up and I couldn't find anything wrong with him. They opened a half hour late and I was told the doctor wouldn't be in for another 4 hours anyway. The receptionist had very little interest in her job and also said that it was normal for the doctor to come in late because she 'owned the practice and set her own hours."<//text><name>Sam McFarland<//name><resp>None< /resp><rating>1<//rating><gmapID>0x80db6f4c0725f495:0x8aa73a2ff9429425< /gmapID>< pics>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I think it's the hardest thing to do to put a pet down when you know they need it. Dr. Green was amazing when we sent our precious little bumper Over the Rainbow Bridge. The time and the Compassion that was shown was above and beyond anything that we could have ever asked for. It was very loving and very peaceful. Our precious little dog you went to heaven knowing that he was loved very very much. Since then we have also taken our little Chihuahua in to see dr. Green for all of her medical needs. They have always been absolutely wonderful and very kind in taking their time. Even something as simple as a nail trimming is done with compassion and care. Now that we have adopted another dog our border collie Molly she will also be taken to dr. Green. We wouldn't take our precious babies anywhere else. They are so Priceless to us and dr. Clean is the only vet that we want to take them to. She has a heart of gold.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80db6f4c0725f495:0x8aa73a2ff9429425</Gmap_id></record>

Took my dogs in for exam and shots and now the next day two of my dogs I can not pick up they are injured have to take to another vet.took one dog to get looked at to see why he walks with his back arched and she just check his head and said might be arthritis. Took him to get anal sacks cleaned and shots he was howling in pain. Next dog we did not hear a thing last dog I heard help. All dogs were for anal cleaning and shots and one exam. 280.00 later and 1 1/2 hours later we left. To wake up this morning to two of our dogs in pain.</Review>

Nice little Chinese restaurant. Never knew this plaza existed before and found this place randomly. The gua bao and the fried chicken was good. Forgot to get photos of the minced pork rice and the dry noodles. The minced pork rice was OK, but the noodles were on point.< /text>

Updated: We actually went back several time already and enjoyed their authentic Taiwanese dishes. Even my 8 yr old daughter likes it. This is the hidden jeweler place yet to be explored by others. I wouldn't mind and encourage friends to try this place.</text><userid>115279403578966822635< /userid><gmapID>0x808fc65827855557:0x6428351fe7e729c7<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>We tried Chef Cho with some friends that were famiar with the place.  It's a little off the beaten path but VERY close to the warm springs BART if you are looking for a nice meal on the way home.  I thought the flavors were very familiar with Tainan cuisine.. flavorful and used quality cuts of meats in preparation.   I would definitely come back again.

My only criticism would be the lean menu..  there are plenty of choices for sure, but having traveled Taiwan quite a bit I would like to see a little more on the menu if possible.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>It's the old Liu He Ye Shi which was located in San Jose. They just moved to warm spring area and the store is much bigger. There are 6 big tables for large parties and quite a few 4 people tables. High chairs and boosters are available.
They don't have too many items on the menu and I think the more special ones are the braised pork rice and intestines.
Prices are a little expensive considering it's in Fremont area though</Review><Time>1495934783860<//Time><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_id>105332917839725645173<//user_id></record>

The best customer service. I will be coming more often. Especially during the evenings all the girls are so nice and helpful. It sucks to see them get treated mean by other customers but i tip my hat to them for staying profesional and giving good customer service even after they get treated poorly. You guys are awesome and stay awesome !! 🙌🏼🙌🏼< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Gmap_id>0x80ea6c4947344139:0x64f885d07d20ad22< /Gmap_id><text>All dollar general stores are built exactly the same. And thats no exaggeration. Layouts the same, the aisles arranged the same, the counters the same, pretty much u go to one uve been at all of them.  Same products same protocols same prices. Which id say is the best part. They definitely have great prices. And I can guarantee to find stuff my household needs for just a fraction of what it may cost at other stores. And as far as the quality goes, well, its not too bad. I can't complain. You can really count on having dollar general as the go to store for everyday things. I can rely on the products the store offers and save on money every month. Its probably the smartest thing I ever did. But the one less star unfortunately is due to the layout of all the stores. There isn't much room for everything. It seems as if the shelf space is very limited. So products are crammed into each aisle. Which leaves narrower areas to walk through. I just wish they had more store space instead of that bigger parking lot.< /text>< Rating>

Usually find what I need, except today. They didn't have several of the things I was looking for.

Plus they had several of their isles blocked with boxes etc.</Text>

I love this place. Around the corner, simple, has what I need, good deals, digital coupons are awesome, staff is friendly and fun, open till 10PM - plus the recent Redbox add in front, added bonus :-D but really a great stop for those "don't want to goto Foodmax/Walmart" type runs, I have gotten dinner several times in visiting - I have so many DG bags :-D Love it!<//text>

The only staff I've interacted with had been, Alady and Sam. Both are outgoing, friendly, very helpful, and attractive. I also like Sam's Blue hair.

I'll be back.

Welcome to the Dollar General... Where NOTHING costs a dollar (not even the store brand, folks) and I seriously don't understand how they have enough employees to shadow each customer individually to make sure they're not stealing.  That doesn't just take talent, it takes professionalism and masterful skills.  They're more like ninjas in that, I kid you not.  I understand that there are thieves everywhere, but dear Lord there's such a thing as too much vigilance because I was beginning to feel unwelcomed.

I ride a motorycle everywhere I go as my daily and normal transportation and because of this, I have a backpack that goes everywhere with me, as well.  I realize that there are places I'm going to be watched more closely, like everyone else is because there's such a thing as healthy paranoia.  It keeps you sharp and focused.  Then, there's the paranoid stalking that comes part and parcel with those who so firmly believe that everyone is out to get theirs that they'll hire a personal security detail for their wall safe at home.  That's not even talking about at the office, folks.  Fort Knox isn't even that secure, in my opinion.

I really do understand that I ride a motorcycle everywhere, and the backpack is a wild card for theft and loss prevention in stores.  I don't understand why I'm singled out for particular attention from both male and female store employees.  The male employees?  That's easy... Chick on a motorcycle.  They don't even have to see me ride the bike to be interested in chatting about it.  The females are a little trickier, responses range from fascinated curiosity to out and out resentment and cold indifference.  I've been riding my bike as daily transportation for a couple of years now; I pretty well know what to expect.

That didn't account for this quantity of attention, though and I even went so far as to ask if it was getting close to closing time because then, I'd have been able to figure out why I felt eyes boring into my back from the moment I walked into the store until the moment I left.  Not kidding again, friends.  I was so uncomfortable as a matter of fact, that it took me more time to write this review than it took me to make my purchases and get out of there.  I was all too happy to leave, if you'd like an illustration and a little perspective there.  That's not normal me.

In short and in the end, the incredible welcome that didn't exist, the misleading prices, and the really rude stalking of the staff places me in a unique position of having to say that I'd only shop at Dollar General under absolute necessity and nothing else.< /text>

< review>
I just picked up an online order for my wife. When I looked at the receipt I couldn’t believe the price of her veggie sandwich.... $18.00??? For that price it should have veggies falling off but It was basically lettuce and dressing with a little avocado. To top it off Apparently they’re out of bell pepper but failed to tell her when she ordered it was written on the individual sandwich  bag.

*updated*  I added several stars to my  rating simply for the fact that the location owner was exceptional in response to the situation.</review>

3:00 in the afternoon, they forgot to put the bacon on the sandwich. Not the end of the world, $14 for a small turkey sandwich, well there are other places.<//review>

If you read the numbers on the menu, you will see some numbers are skipped. If you ask what is the sandwich for the skipped number, they will tell you.

Way better than Subway, it's not even close.

This location is great and if you are in a hurry you can order online, call or fax in your order.

They are very willing to make you happy here. So if you think the roast beef is to grey or to red for your liking. They have always been willing to put that piece back and grab one you like.

I ask for crispy bacon to add at the end. They do a great job of giving me those types of pieces.

Don't forget to sign up and get the points.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80e820c35daa368d:0x369d96789739733d<//gmap_id>< user_name>

Terrible experience. I love the food, but on a Sunday at 1:30pm they were completely out of bread and refused to compensate us in any way. No manager present and we were given plenty of attitude from a sandwich maker.<//Text>

< review>
I am highly disappointed in the lack of customer service at the Calabasas Jersey Mikes. I live in Ventura and my son accidently ordered 2 sandwiches online to be picked up from the store in Calabasas. That is too far to drive to pick up any sandwich no matter how good they are. Once I figured out why the sandwiches were not ready for pick-up at the Ventura Mall I called the store in Calabasas. My first call left me somewhat puzzled. The store manager, I will not reveal his name as of yet, told me sorry, there is nothing he can do. He refused to let me speak with his boss but said that he would call him and have his boss call me back. I received no such call of course. I called back and he said that they are on vacation and will call me after they return.
This seems like an easy fix. Most businesses that I have dealt with probably would have given me store credit or called the Ventura store to have them make me a couple of sandwiches. No big deal. I understand that it was a mistake on my sons part and he has owned it. But I am out $20 and with nothing to eat. In my book this is not great customer service. It's too bad, I loved their sandwiches. I guess its "Mikes Way" or the highway.</review>

Poor quality food. The one on ventura blvd is 100000 times better. I was shocked how bad this one was. Their giants were so small compared to the one in woodland hills never going back to that one again. But i love JM.< /review>

Leaf n Cream in Tustin is my go-to for smoothies & I live in Murrieta.
We've been to Monsta Snow only a handful of times, and their selection looks to have something for everyone.  Staff is helpful & friendly.
If only they can make Mr. Mango with sweet cream like LnC I'd be put 5 stars.</Text>

Won’t be coming here again. (Temecula location.) Sad. I was a regular. Employee decided to close 15 minutes early and I documented via photo I came before closing. Tried to order online it was down at 9:15 and proceeded to call. No one answered. So I drove over and got poor customer service. Unfortunate</review>

{'time': 1613940196993, 'text': 'Hi Cayla,\nI’m sorry for any confusion, but we actually close at 9pm every day (since Covid-19 began). Our current hours are posted on the door, as well as on our website and Yelp. Our online ordering system cut off is at 8pm to allow customers enough time to pick up their orders by closing. I apologize we missed your call - we were cleaning and closing up at that time and didn’t hear the phone. We hope to have the opportunity to serve you again. Please let me know if there’s anything else I can do.'}<//response>

It's a cool experience eating the "snow". Their snow looks flakey almost like cotton candy, but it's cold and melts in your mouth. I've had both the matcha monsta and thai tea snow which were both delicious. The matcha monsta has real red beans and strawberries and the thai tea has boba, both also come with mini mochi. Their presentation could use a bit more work, but other than that, it's a great place to grab ice cream. They also have waffle cones and cold/hot drinks.<//review>

<text>I love Monsta Snow! Their milk teas are super yummy and have lots of different flavors. The slushees are delish too especially the taro slushee and pistachio. You can order ahead or they have a machine that you can order there as well instead of waiting for others. I'll always come back for more.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Review>I think I've found my milk tea / ice cream waffle place. I tried their strawberry milk tea and got a waffle with strawberry ice cream. It was so delicious and refreshing. The waffle was the perfect size and the strawberries tasted fresh. The ladies were very polite as well.< /Review>< pictures>

They forgot my order. While I was outside the building during the hot weather, I realized I've been waiting about 30-40 minutes and the customers who came in after me were getting their drinks before I got mine. I told an employee, she went back inside, came out a minute later and told me they lost my order receipt.So they refunded my money and quiclky made my upgraded drinks. I know they were very busy with online orders. They probably ignored me because I'm old and I don't fit their cool/hip "customer criteria". I don't know if want to come back. Their drinks were good, but I'm still kind of angry about the incident.<//Text>

To this day, I still don\'t know why it happened - it just didn\'t print, an inexplicable technological blip. I understand your frustration, unfortunately I couldn\'t change what had already happened, but I tried to remedy the situation the best I could. I\'m deeply sorry that you weren\'t happy with the solution - could you let me know what else we could do to make up for it? We 100% don\'t discriminate here, and maybe our social media depicts a "hip/young" vibe, but our "customer base" spans across all ages. Please feel free to reach out to me directly at monstasnow@gmail.com if there\'s anything I can do. -Laura'}< /response><gmapID>0x80db7e77ff568deb:0x34d85210fcab3db3< /gmapID></record>

Wonderful location serving taiwanese shaved ice, boba drinks, bubble waffle ice cream treats, and even new additions like their mini lumpia bites.  The staff is very friendly, and the serving size is wuite ample.  One order of their shaved snows can easily feed two.  In a couple of weeks they will also begin doing a halo halo (Filipino traditional dessert) shaved ice.  The location's interior may seem sparse,  but definitely understandable given this is an local restaurant just starting up.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.</review>

This place has flavorful food, delicious drinks and delectable desserts. I love boba drinks and that's what brought me here in the first place. The desserts simply look amazing without even tasting them you want more. The K-Pop Chicken was wonderful. I love saucy foods and this doesn't disappoint at all, they even give you another flavor of dipping sauce on the side. I'm one of those guys that licks the sauce off my plate so it was much appreciated. This is definitely my new go to reward myself place.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80db7e77ff568deb:0x34d85210fcab3db3< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Delicious! My first time having Taiwanese shaved ice... It was different from other shaved ice. Much more like ice cream.
The place is clean and had plenty of seating. Employees were nice and patient explaining to us about all the great things on the menu.</text>

Incredible line-up of syrup to milk tea ratio. I had the dirty oolong and it brought back childhood memories of when teavana was mixed through tea leaves and brown sugar crystals.</Review>

In response to COVID-19, we have been encouraging order ahead options to avoid overcrowding at the store, so many of our customers are utilizing DoorDash, phone ahead ordering, and online ordering. We are making all orders in the order that they come in, so it may appear that people behind you or people that walk in are getting their orders ahead of you, but that is because they placed orders ahead of time and we have them ready. I hope that you give us another chance to provide you with a better experience. Please come see myself (Laura) or Brian so we can personally take care of you."}<//Response>

Very friendly staff. We only had the boba drinks. My daughter liked the Cookies N Cream smoothie. The Thai tea is too sweet to my liking. And I even asked them to make it not so sweet. I was disappointed that their boba wasn't fresh. It didn't have that right chewy texture. Especially since their prices are higher than other local Boba places, I was expecting better boba.< /review>

Love this place. Can't remember the exact names of our orders but the monster bubble waffle, taro shaved ice, and the coffee shake with boba were all delicious. We will be regular customers.</text>

The boba milk tea and bubble waffle are good. Going to try other items on the menu next time. I wish they offer Taiwanese popcorn chicken.<//review>

Reviewed on 2018-11-12

This is about the third time we've been here.  Teenagers often hangout at this establishment, probably because of the same reason as to why my kids got us to come here.

The place is clean and the staff members are friendly.  The decorations on the walls look like a coloring book and use pastel colors that pleasantly soothe the eyes.

My wife and I ordered the honeydew and black milk tea boba.  We enjoy the smooth texture and the soft boba.

The kids opted the "I want s'mores bubble waffles", which comes with vanilla ice cream, marshmallow fluff, chocolate chips and graham cracker crumbling.

We will definitely come back for more, especially since when you check into Yelp they will give you an upgrade from regular to large. I also appreciate the fact that they respect and acknowledge our U.S. Military service members with a 25% discount during Veterans Day!< /text>

<text>Nice place to do some quick last minute shopping, prices are a bit high for being a place called family Dollar but like I said if it's quick last minute shopping and you're in a pinch it's a good place to go could use a little bit of more management as they don't seem to change the times on their door so they're supposed to be open until 9:00 or 10:00 but they close at 8:00 other than that employees are pretty friendly I suppose somewhat lacking in knowledge of the items that they sell but that's common nowadays.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Good stuff to buy but never ask to break change. Just asked to change a $5 For bus fare and the lady acted like if I was going to take all the money. Good thing there is a Family Dollar closer where i live because I am not coming back to this location.<//Text>< Pictures>

This store is very dirty and disorganized. The toy and makeup aisles are the worst! There are a lot of bums that hang around near the store.< /Review>

<text>I was also trying to communicate with the store, so when we went in to make a purchase. I asked the cashier, why dont they pick up the call. So the store associate told me the  reason that they don't  answer the calls is because they dont have a phone but the line works. The store manager needs to be more responsible and request the company to add a telephone since their is an active phone line. I called the family dollar store in west covina ca and they do pick up the phone, even the store manager in the family dollar west covina, that when she calls that they do not pick up<//text></record></dataset><record>

There might be too much MSG in the food. Moreover, the food here is too greasy.<//Text>

One of the few Shanghai style restaurants in Los Angeles, and it serves Shanghai comfort food.  Shanghai cuisine features soups, heavy soups, and stews. Try it.< /Text>

Two cooks were banging full slabs of ribs on the concrete behind the restaurant and then proceeded to carry them inside on a sheet pan. If this is what was caught imagine what we dont see.

< review>
(Translated by Google) The beef burritos I bought very stingly are all thin sauce. Two slices of beef even the coriander is too far away from what I ate at Luweiju. Every bite of beef burritos is solid beef for business. Ordered beef roll pancake, extremely stingy with beef and even cilantro. All you can taste is just the pancake and they charge you almost 10 dollars for that. I would rather go to in-n-out for beef burger next time, they give you a solid beef meat patty for half the price.

非常小气 买的牛肉卷饼全是酱 薄薄两片牛肉 连香菜也舍不得放 跟我在鲁味居吃的差太远了 鲁味居的牛肉卷饼 每一口扎扎实实的都是牛肉 做生意没有什么良心 Ordered beef roll pancake, extremely stingy with beef and even cilantro. All you can taste is just the pancake and they charge you almost 10 dollars for that. I would rather go to in-n-out for beef burger next time, they give you a solid beef meat patty for half the price.</review>

Great Local Bar. Always have whatever game you want to watch on. Good drinks. Low key atmosphere to chill and hang out and have a drink< /text>

<review>Good place to late night or any time for a drink and chill or play pool and catch a game .. fare prices cool bartenders and cool people .. never had any issues here. You can also  get some food . Burgers fries wings .. platters at a fare price. You can play music .. and it's close to a lot of places .. bars stores and more< /review>< Pictures>

It was awesome. Me and my beautiful lady went and we played some pool and we had drinks and the music was on point. Not too old not too young! Everything was great!</Text>

< Review>
Its a local sports bar that is what one would consider to be a sports bar that doesn't cater to the hipster crowd. Food is good but I've never had it sober. Bartenders are professional. A few pool tables and air hockey. Good for groups if you want to hang and down few pinta.<//Review>

<name>Igor Avidon< /name><Date>1515464475594< /Date><Rating>2< /Rating><text>This is kind of a dumpy place reminiscent of the average LA bar in the 90s. There is a pool table and typical bar food is offered. But overall it's not a place to get excited about and if you're a tourist you should go experience something more fun in the area.< /text>< Pictures>

I can walk there in 10 minutes. Service is poor. Dark and dingy atmosphere.  Looks like a Gay Bar. Typical night 20 to 25 guys.
4 or 5 girls.  And that's it. Nearly every night.< /Review>

Was here for the UFC about 2 weeks ago.
Gave them my card too keep a tab.
Payed in cash before i left, got my card back, didnt tip them much since the food wasnt all the great, couldnt hear the commentators/bad sound, and annoying waitresses.

Anyway, checked my account a week later, realize they stole about 30 dollars from me even thou i payed it all in cash before i left.

Dont go there, dont support thieves.<//Text>

The staff were wonderful, the food excellent!  A great place to get one of the best comfort foods around - Mac & Cheese.  The Smokey Bacon and the Gilroy Garlic were so tasty.  Parking was a breeze for us at the time we went (Sunday, 6:30 pm) but I imagine it may be a bit difficult at times, but worth it.< /text>

<text>Been here a lot of times, always satisfies my craving for ma and cheese! I've tried the jalapeño, the garden Mac, and garlic Mac, chorizo, all great.
Mac and cheese is typically a heavy meal, but the garden Mac is somehow "refreshing", so i think at the moment it's my favorite!
Def more options to try, plus a make your own option.
And the mixed alcohol drinks are tasty as well!< /text>< Pics>

YUMMY!!! It’s mac n’ cheese at its best! What stands out is that it’s not an over the top kind of mnc, but more old school. Hence, their name. You can order as simple or as loaded as you want. They also have signature blends, but I went with the classic with broccoli and scallions. Must try.</Text>

Honestly, I do not understand where these great reviews comes from. I'm not a picky eater but my husband makes better mac and cheese. The grilled chicken was not fresh and tasty. Unfortunately, driving more than 30 miles was not my best decision.

(PS: The food is not more than 3 stars!) The staff was nice and they were smiling to customer. So, 5 stars for staff and removing 1 star for overall experience.< /review><username>Berfin Paker</username><rating>4< /rating>< GmapID>

<text>Mac & Cheese is not something that I grew up with so I don't have the "comfort food" association that many of my friends have about this particular American dish.  It takes a little extra for me to review something publicly; especially if its not something I would go out of my way for.  I go out of my way for Homeroom.  My co-worker introduced me to Homeroom when she ordered for a company luncheon.  Then through a strange set of events, I met Erin Wade.  Homeroom has become a place I am happy to support.  The food is really damn good.  I'm not vegan but the vegan option is creamy and the noodles hold up really well so when I am trying a little harder to make better choices, I don't feel guilty about ordering a batch of vegan mac.  I've ordered the family dinner option for "neighbor" night (an almost monthly event where a bunch of us neighbor's   check in and chat - now social distance rules apply).  On my single girl nights, I order the Aged White Mac and a salad.  Glass of wine, yummy mac and cheese, and a bit of greens to balance it out (boyfriend happily has leftovers for lunch).  Homeroom is a win win.  Order take out or via one of the food delivery services.  It's a comfort food treat that is well worth it.<//text>< resp>

I love this place because the service is always friendly, the food is very GOOD and comforting and you can make your own additions - meat or veggies or go with Vegan, whatever you want --  to already wonderful flavor combinations.Today I had a REALLY rough day at work and thought I'd stop by for dinner after an appointment. I hadn't been back to Homeroom for a very long time. I ordered a side of Brussel sprouts, which I love. I usually only order sides when I can share with friends, but I thought, "Dang, I can eat this for lunch tomorrow." The hostess was so nice. She brought me a homemade oreo cookie for dessert, no charge. I almost cried, I was so happy to be treated well. Did I mention that it had been a Very Rough Day? It had. She made my day. I also shared my card with her, since the new seating area is ALL OUTSIDE AT SIDEWALK LEVEL, perfect for wheelchairs. I work with disabled clients, and this would be perfect for them. Now I can tell them they can visit and write their own review. And they can call our service if their chair gets stuck. That's what we do. Give rides to folks. Thank you for reading this.< /text>

<Review>I love homeroom! I've tried many of their mac and cheeses, and I've never been disappointed. My personal favorite is the aged white cheddar! I think the only downside to homeroom is how popular they are. Even if you order online, prepare for the kitchen to be a little bit behind. But it's worth the wait!< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Great service, great food. It's as simple as that. You want Mac & Cheese, learn to make it or get a silky smooth bowl right here. I've been making Mac for like 6 months now and I still can't make one like their's. Granted, I suck at cooking. But I've been trying, and it's hard to make it like they do... For me. Again. I'm really bad at cooking.
Also, the people that work their are really friendly, that's huge. Makes the place feel like a "homeroom"... Ok I'm not sure what "feels like a homeroom" would even mean but their service is really good.<//text>< Name>

<Text>My friend ordered the Elote Mac (the pic where you can see with cotija and limes on top). He customized it to add hot dogs in it. I took a taste of that mac and it was good.

I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Mac customized it to not have the homemade ranch but add peas and chorizo. It was yummy and creamy.

These mac & cheese meals tend to take 1/2 the order home (or almost 1/2).

Highly recommend this restaurant if you're in the mood for some creative mac & cheese options.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Date>1618621548950<//Date>< response>

<text>Homeroom is an east bay classic for a reason - the mac n'cheese is delicious, the portions are huge, the owners&workers seem great too! Only docking one star because it's a little pricy if you want add-ins, and I'd highly recommend them (if only to get a veggie and have a balanced meal lol). That being said, the portion is generous enough that I've always found half is enough to eat in one sitting and you can save the other half for another meal.< /text>< Resp>

<review>The Mac n cheese was awesome. You must realize that this really is the only thing on the menu. So if anyone in your party isn’t down for that, they’ll leave hungry. Lol. But I totally loved my bbq pork Mac n cheese. You order in your phone and they bring the order to your table when it’s ready. So it’s nice that you don’t have to flag down a waiter and you’ve already paid, so you can leave as soon as you’re ready.

Our kids loved the food, too! I have to say that I was particularly impressed with how perfectly aldente the noodles were. Also, they give the option to add basically anything to your dish. So I added bacon and potato chips. (Although the cups come in a bag, not crumbled for you lol).

The tables are only set up for parties of four. We were with our friends and all of our kids - a party of seven. But then kids shared the side of a table that had a bench, so they fit perfectly. Us adults took the chairs on the ends.

My only complaint was the bathroom situation. They only have one bathroom. And since the restaurant was at their limited Covid capacity, you had to wait for the restroom outside of the restaurant, lined up at their door. Pretty annoying as a parent who of course gets asked multiple times throughout a meal to use the bathroom.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNx60USM6Jnssi7jIzuZsHvqZkzKY3uCaYLhcA3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

<time>1606072357336< /time><Rate>5</Rate><text>I’ve been coming to Homeroom for a few years now, so I should’ve written a review sooner, but now seems like a perfect time to mention how much I love this place! My then-boyfriend and I had one of our first dates here, so when our wedding was postponed and we decided to downsize this year’s ceremony to next to nothing, we knew Homeroom would be perfect, and they were. Not only are they always so careful and accommodating of our gluten-free requests (my husband (!!) has Celiac), but they called me on my wedding day to congratulate us, confirm that my order was ready, and they showered us with good wishes and some complimentary desserts. They could not have been kinder, and even at their busiest they are efficient and nice and fun. Thank you Homeroom for making our special day that much more special, we love you and will continue to enjoy your delicious Mac n Cheese as newlyweds!<//text>< Pictures>

It was ok. My mind wasn't blown like I expected it to be or as my friends kept saying it would be. They certainly love this place - I think the Mac n Cheese is alright. But I prefer MAC'D.

We got there around 8:30/9 and still had to wait a little bit to get in. The drinks were good and the servers were fun though.< /Text>

Super friendly service and delicious food! I’ve never had Mac and cheese where the pasta actually had good texture. Huge portions, so share or prepare to bring some home! Here’s how much damage I could do by myself...< /text>

I'm not even the biggest Mac and Cheese person, but this place was amazing! They have so many unique variations of the dish that there's sure to be something for everyone (unless you're lactose intolerant lol). Even then, everything is customize-able and made fresh to order. I even happened to own the cookbook for this place without realizing it. Yup, this place is so good it has a cookbook devoted to mac and cheese. 100% worth the food coma< /review>

<text>If you like mac and cheese this is the place to go. I've been wanting to check this place out and finally found the opportunity to go here. It's a really small place, so get here early. It was about an hour wait at 5:30 PM on a Friday night. They only seat you if your entire party is present.
Service was good once we got seated. I ordered the most popular, Gilroy Garlic mac and cheese ($11.75) and added breadcrumbs for an extra ($0.95). It was a healthy portion of food and ended up being two meals. Taste wise it was decent but I had high expectations due to all the good reviews. I might want to try something different next go around.</text>< Pictures>

<rating>2</rating><Text>I got the aged white cheddar mac and cheese and it wasn't that good. The cheese was good but the noodles were super undercooked so they were chewy and dense. It kept getting stuck to my teeth. I tried my friend's food and it was the same. I'm from the south and I've traveled all over (and I've eaten mac and cheese in many different states) so I feel like I know what good mac and cheese is like and unfortunately, for me, this was not it.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Must. Devour. Cheese. But, to be serious, I only bother to review a place if it is either exceptionally good or quite terrible. This place is the former, and I love it! Bf and I got delivered 3 types of their mac and cheese, and all are exquisite. Reordered a few times, and each time was consistently delicious in quality and taste. The Gilroy is a particular favorite and I highly recommend it. Comfort food done right and with a twist to keep things interesting!< /text>< time>

<review>Friendly staff. Ive come here since the beginning and the decor and seating have changed a lot. Gone were the really fun school like theme with the library dew decimal system and the stapel bay area community seating. Now there are separate booths that although are totally fine, lose the appeal of the old restaurant.  Also not impressed with the tacked on "living wage" fee.< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>I'm a long time Oakland, Piedmont Avenue Area resident, and those that know of my area know of the many restaurants to choose from.
Yesterday I tried Homeroom on 40th Street for the first time and have to say I have never been so impressed with so many things about an eating establishment.
I was greeted by a lovely person named Jessica who handed me my take-out order and completed the transaction.
I had the Mexican Macaroni, and a side of brussel sprouts w/bacon.
The portions were huge, packaged extremely well as I was walking, and they even threw in a delicious cookie, no charge. The order was ready on time and again Jessica was a delight. I will for sure become a regular.

Best mac and cheese I've ever had! The noodles are cooked to a perfect al dente and the flavours meld together so well. Cannot stop eating once started.< /text>

<review>I found my macaroni to be a little too al dente and the flavor not quite to my liking. I had the standard Mac and cheese with bacon. Really cool little spot with a compelling menu, I just did not enjoy the food. The others in party were totally satisfied with their food. I will probably give it another shot next time I’m in the Bay.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1610510918496, 'text': "Hi N K,\nYour feedback is critical in helping us listen, learn, and improve.

I was really looking forward to trying Homeroom, but when I went to pick up my online order (right on time), my food was completely cold and the pasta was very undercooked. Very disappointing to come all the way from Marin to pay over $23 for a cold meal. 😞<//Review>

I've never been able to understand a restaurant that only caters to one specific food. I was curious about a place that basically only does macaroni and cheese in different forms and styles. I decided to get there vegan Mac with vegan sausage and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious and flavorful, the staff was charming and attentive, and the atmosphere was fantastic even for a place that was completely packed the day I went. Even though I know that the workers were working double-time, the smiles never left their faces and they still managed to be completely courteous and got what I needed to me very quickly whether it was boxes to take food home, the desert I ended up ordering, or the check. personally, I can't wait to go back</Text>

You really can't go wrong with any selection here but the Buffalo chicken Mac is hard to pass up. You'll want to clear your plate but the portions are generous enough to take some home, which is good because you'll definitely be craving more well after leaving the restaurant.</text>

Went to Homeroom on a random Sunday.  While it was very busy, I was fortunate to get a table for myself.

I had the spicy crab mac and cheese, and it was delicious. Everything was well balanced between the cheese, macaroni, bread crumbs, & sriracha sauce. The level of spiciness was good for me. But, I assume you can ask for more hot sauce.

Will return.<//Text>

I've never been disappointed eating at Homeroom. This time we got a salad and spicy crab mac and cheese. We were both raving about how great they tasted. Service is always great. The only cons are that your car might get broken into and it's fairly loud inside.< /Text>

Tonight we ate in their parklets and it was so perfect. They are celebrating their 10th bday and we got to sample some new funfetti cookie sandwiches and they were BOMB. Can’t say enough good things.</Review>< Pictures>

The flavors are huge, the ingredients are top flight and the prices are reasonable. Cheap and cheerful, so very hard to beat. The portions are humongous so perhaps consider splitting. They had a very nice local beer menu with several fun offerings and some good local wines, so that is covered as well. This is a fun little spot that is definitely worth a visit or several.< /review>< Pictures>

Holy damn! I thought my life was over after going dairy free, and that I would never get good food. This vegan Mac? Sinful. Like, my non-vegan friends almost regretted their cheese. Keep doing this homeroom. The red blend is great with the vegan Mac. Do yourself a favor and just go here.</Text>

<review>Ordered the vegan mac with soyrizo and chips on top because, why not? It was ok, a little like chili mac and cheese. The portion was more than enough for one meal. We were 5th on the list for a table and the wait was not too long. I’m glad I went but it doesn’t top my list of places to return to.< /review>< pictures>

<Review>This place is way too overpriced for what it is

Edit: reply to owner: I could understand that but the ingredients are mac and cheese... Also 7.99 for a small banana cream parfait? Just thinking about the price of an organic banana and cream and that's just robbery< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< name>

It's been long overdue since my last meal here. The server can tell as I ask how long ago did they no longer serve the truffle mac. This time around I picked one of their seasonal macs. Spicy Crab which was delicious! Looks like I'll be having them for lunch tomorrow as 1 order fills two sittings :) luckily there wasn't a huge crowd. As I recall few years back you'd be waiting for awhile. Had their banana cream pie parfait. Its quiet on the sugary side with the caramel layer on top. Def a good spot for some mac n cheese!</review>

<Text>Very unique take on Mac and cheese. If you're itching for Mac then come here. Many different flavors. I got the spicy crab and it was delicious. The only problem is that it is quite heavy and lots of carbs. You won't finish it. If you don't care about health then have at it. My advice: share a bowl with someone.</Text>< pics>

Great food but even greater service. They forgot to add chicken in my brother’s order and the host not only provided a side of chicken but gave him a free giant oreo!

Come for the ambience alone and the food is a great plus.</Review>

After a nice long run. I know it's bad to have a cheat meal immediately afterwards, but I was feeling slightly homesick and craved for some comfort food. For starters we had the spicy cauliflower, I ordered the pizza mac which was a daily special. My partner in crime ordered the jalapeno poppers mac. Perfect balance of spicy and cheesy goodness. The pizza mac stayed true to its name and had that stretchy cheesy bite you look forward to on any pizza. The spicy cauliflower was perfect. The slightly charred edges gave it that nutty and beautiful smokey flavour profile. This place really hit the spot in terms of comfort. The staff were lovely, lively, and absolute sweethearts. Perfect attention to detail and super fast. Honestly I don't even remember having to ask or noticing them fill my water glass. It was like a bottomless cup. I definitely can't wait until my next visit.</Review>

I came for some outdoor dining and ordered the breakfast mac n cheese and a half baked elote mac n cheese to take home. The food was delicious but it took awhile for it to be ready. I waited almost an hour for my order.<//text>

I went here for the first time on the recommendation of a friend and they had outdoor seating which was nice with covid. Unfortunately, the food took over 40 minutes to come out and service was not great. I ordered the garlic mac and brussels sprouts. Would not recommend in terms of overall experience.</Review>

I've been here so many times and every time was great. Last one wasn't. My friend order the mac and cheese with goat cheese and didn't took more than an hour until she got super sick, I also tried and diarrhea was for 3 or 4 days. She had a terrible stomachache, she described the most painful she ever had. After that she vomited everything. We didn't ate anything else that day. I contact them and they just apologized for the situation and tried to gave me some coupons, that never came but why do I want coupons when we got super sick with that food. Anyways. I'm not going back.< /Review>

I have to be honest, I'm not a big mac&cheese fan. Nonetheless, the appetizers were good, and the mac and cheese was extremely cheesy! If you like mac and cheese, this place is definitely for you, if not, come here for the ice coffee and some friends that likes Mac&cheese. 😃< /review>< pictures>

Design your own Mac 'n' cheese dish? Yes, please! Had this on our list of places to visit for a while based on an article hubby had read in the news awhile back. Our meal experience did not disappoint. A wide array of add-in options including, peas, chips, CHEETOS?! and so much more. The outdoor seating area is surrounded by succulents and some other blooming plants. Inside, the wallpaper is macaroni-themed and the design of the interior is definitely unique, fun, and modern including potted plants up high on a shelf. The menu is super cute as well and outlines the restaurant's values. From our greeter to our waiter, we were met with a smile and great service. The jalepeño mac 'n' cheese dish was a tear-jerker for my husband at times, but, I would agree it was totally worth the flavor. Wow!</Text>

Wow. If you are like me and didnt grow up eating mac and cheese, and you feel that it's an acquired taste, please go to this place. This is not something regular. It's another level mac and cheese. Everything is delicious but the classic is mouth watering. They marry the bechamel with the cheese so perfectly.  All the other dishes looked amazing too. A must try.<//review>

Had the vegan and gluten free mac n cheese, absolutely loved it! Fairly big portion, too. Ordered in store, and while they were busy, it was only about 15min before my food was ready. I'm only in town for a couple nights, wish I had one back home :)<//Review>

I really enjoyed it. I'm a basic girl who loves her carbs. It was super crowded when we came but we were seated quickly and served as quickly as we could have been. I ordered the spinach artichoke feta Mac and cheese. My husband got the chorizo Mac and cheese, we thought it was alright. I would go back if I were in Oakland< /text>

<review>O M G .... super yummy well served mac-n-cheese!!

Definitely one plate of mac is enough for 2!

They have kids menu, traditional and awesome new flavors.. plus awesome add on ingredients, as well as delicious sides either veggies sauteed or salads...

Also!!! As quick note they gave vegan options!!

And the desserts looked oh so amazing!!
( we didn't try any on this trip as we were oh so full of mac-n-cheese😅)

Highly recommend it... plus you can order online and pick up to take home!< /review>< pics>

Lovely little place! Our favorite is the stuffed gnocchi with the mushroom cream. My friend's favorite was the Pappardelle. Everything was delicious! Our absolute favorite part of the evening was our server Fira. She was knowledgeable, responsive, attentive, helpful, and a complete sweetheart!!! One of the best customer service experiences I've had in a long time. Cheers to you, Fira!<//review>

Let me tell, you, it's worth the cold wait outside, because once you get seated and you get that wonderful bowl of comfort food in front of you, nothing else matters.

We got the Mexican one and also the Garlic one (with broccoli and chicken added). The Mexican one was super good. Whatever cheese they use is amazing and I love the kick of spice and the chorizo is delicious! Definitely a fan! The Garlic one I was skeptical of getting because it seemed so simple, but boy was I mistaken! It had the perfect amount of garlic and I kept apologizing to it in my head for almost not ordering it. The broccoli and chicken added the perfect veggie and protein component. Do yourself a favor and add breadcrumbs to all your mac and cheese dishes!!!

This are also huge! We took half of each home. I couldn't be more excited for leftovers.

Overall, if you love mac and cheese, this is definitely the place to come to!< /Review><user_name>Sophia Yuen<//user_name><time>1489275297864<//time><rating>5</rating><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
The vegan Mac and cheese was AMAZING! I added carmelized onions, broccoli and breadcrumbs. I've been vegan for a long time and had my fair share of dairy free cheese substitutes but this was for sure top 10. My date eats meat but he went vegetarian for this with the white cheddar and added cauliflower and spinach said it was amazing as well. A bit of a wait but we grabbed drinks and it was totally worth it. Definitely going back here.<//Review>

Quite an interesting place and experience. Food was really well seaso ed. I was worried about the saltyness of the dishes because of the cheese but i was pleasantly surprised. I truly enjoyed my macximus though wished it hade more chicken which i had added.

Service though was something else. They got 2 of our orders wrong. The jalapeno one was a bit disappointing. My niece found no jalapeno at all and was not a bit spicy hot, we were wondering if they got this order wrong as well.</text>

I ordered the chicken pot pie Mac and cheese and my cousin ordered the chicken bacon ranch Mac and cheese both were good I feel like hers taste better she felt like mine was more delicious we also ordered sangria and I had a Coke we talked to the waitress and she found out it was the day after my cousins birthday and gave her a free dessert , an salty caramel apple crumble Al la mode it was delicious and enough for 2 people to share I was worried about foreign foods ruining my Mac and cheese but everything was really good and I would definitely and am looking forward to visiting this place again<//review>

This place doesn’t serve Mac and cheese. It serves under or overcooked pasta smothered in a disgusting cheese sauce. I’ve tried the bacon Mac and cheese and although it should be expected to be a bit salty it tasted like a bowl of salt.  I tried the Gilroy garlic version and it tasted like they put a while bottle of garlic salt in it.  I like salty foods but this place is just bad.<//Text>

Wow! Just wow! Our 1st visit was perfection so we didn't think it could live up to our expectations. Instead it exceeded them. Pesto Mac n cheese was creamy, well balanced and tender. The Elote was a tasty surprise--street corn marries mac with a hint of heat. The Hawaiian was cheesy, bacony and chunks of pineapple. We had to go with our favorite Brussel sprouts with bacon; cooked to just the right texture. We ate outside and really appreciated the well implemented COVID-19 standards.<//Text>

Been coming here for about 7 years and it's always been the best. Haven't found better Mac and Cheese anywhere else in America. The Gilroy garlic and jalapeno poppers ones are classics but after those two, I just get whatever seems the whackiest at the time. They update the menu quite frequently and have specials.</Review>

This weekend I finally got the opportunity to try the famous Homeroom!

Course 1️⃣: buttermilk biscuit with honey butter

Course 2️⃣: chicken, bacon & ranch mac n cheese

Course 3️⃣: homemade oreo cookie

I enjoyed the service and ambiance but my mac n cheese dish was lacking some flavor and the quality of the food could improve a bit. The portions were large though, I could only finish 1/2 of my mac n cheese plate.

Overall I think Homeroom deserves a solid 8/10. If you have a mac n cheese obsession this is definitely your place! They have so many options it’s possible also I just didn’t try the right one 😬. Maybe one day I’ll return and see! For a more in depth review you can visit my restaurant rating page @ieat_irate on instagram.< /review>

Our wait time was nonexistent, considering how packed the joint was. The wait staff was very friendly and inviting. Scrumptious mac ‘n cheese. The portions were extremely large and ate as much as we could. Arrived in Riga, Latvia later in our trip and unpacked and subsequently enjoyed more Homeroom mac ‘n cheese! If you’re visiting Oakland and have the time or if you’ve got a layover, you must visit this awesomely quaint restaurant. It’s in what I would consider a residential area. Parking may take a minute, but you’ll probably not have more than a 5 minute walk at the most. Your tastebuds will surely thank you.<//Text>

The Mac-and-cheese selection at Homeroom offers something for everybody. The different cheese flavors for every Mac accompanied by a multitude of sides and add-ons make this a go-to restaurant in Oakland. Their service always exceeds expectations and food is fresh and always comes soon after ordering. The sangria is always a delicious complement to the rich and creamy Mac-and-cheese.  There’s always enough Mac for leftovers. A dining experience can be a little pricey, for Mac-and cheese anyway.< /Text>

A restaurant devoted to saucy, gooey mac and cheese? Yes, please! I’ve had quite a few of the entrees here, but the bacon mac and jalapeño mac are two of my favorites. I also enjoy the Brussels sprouts and Caesar salad. I usually get takeout to avoid the long lines at the restaurant, and was glad they opened up the separate Homeroom to go a block away so you don’t have to jostle your way through the crowds to get your order.</review>

It's good, but I feel like it's a little pricey for mac and cheese. I've also had and made better mac and cheese but there are a lot of options for a lot of different takes on mac and cheese. If you're a huge mac fan you will love it!</Text>

Great food, great service, reasonable prices, ok beer selection.
My only gripe is that it's very noisy.
Also, the jalapeno pepper mac and cheese has a good amount of bite to it.  Delicious.</Review>

My second time here, their mac is delicious! 😍 I never would've thought of pizza mac and cheese, but they did and it was genius. Cool decor, inside or outside seating, servers are always nice and ours totally recommended her favorites. Good thing about eating here, I had leftovers for the next day!</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>The food is amazing and the options are endless.

The parking: only street parking available
Seating: order seating, indoor seating, and community table seating
What do I order: the vegan option because my poor stomach can't take dairy like it used to.
What does my boyfriend order: the Gilroy and garlic, which we've been told is one of the most requested choices.
The beauty of this restaurant: you can add chicken, sausage, vegetables and/or breadcrumbs to your Mac and cheese, or simply create your own.
The prices: ended up paying nearly $50 for these two dishes and two alcoholic drinks
Worth it: Yes, but only once in a while.

**Note: There's usually a wait.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyYOHSYGwQV3gYIPwr5kV8AEuyb9CeYOJqw-BR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9hg7gai-xqnO-lVZ89O6FR6m4LDwenBP8fJMg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

it's better to eat at the restaurant than receive delivery. at $25 per person, even when eating from the children's menu it is too expensive for what you get. additionally every time we eat at homeroom recently, we receive gluten in orders we requested to be gluten free!<//Review>

If you love mac n cheese, this is THE place. I had the smoky bacon, with added hot peppers, and added the crispy topping. Not pictured is the Snakebite (kölsch and cider), which is a perfect hot day refresher. They have amazing desserts here, too. I particularly like the peanut butter pie. But, beware: the desserts are rich.< /Text>

< review>
First time trying this place and I went for the chicken pot pie. It was pretty ordinary and nothing to write home about. IMO a bit overhyped. The service/staff was great and friendly but probably won't be coming back.< /review>

Best mac & cheese ever tasted! Large portion which can be divided into two meals! Also appreciate vegetarian and vegan options.<//text>

The food is pretty good. There’s always a
long wait though, and for the amount of food and the quality, the price isn’t always worth it. The communal seating is a cool idea though.< /Text>

Quality staff, considerate owners, and wonderful food. Just a heads up - there's a 10 percent charge on top of your order that's split between all staff. Thumbs up to the owners who pave the way forward.< /Text>

Reservations: no reservations but you can put your name down on the waitlist when you arrive or use the yelp app to claim your spot on the waitlist before you arrive. Dinner time on the weekend will be a 30-45 min wait.

If you don’t want to wait or you want your food at home, Homeroom to-go is around the corner!

Both indoor and outdoor seating available.

Dishes are about 12-20$ each but because they are so filling you are able to take some one and it makes it as if you paid for 2 meals. The Mac and cheese here is AWESOME. Absolutely feel good food. Really filling.

I had the Gilroy Garlic and I added chicken and breadcrumbs. would recommend breadcrumbs for almost any dish!</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The service was phenomenal, the interior is super cute, and the portion sizes for the mac and cheeses are enough for two! I really wanted to like the food, but everything besides the honey butter that came with the biscuit was a bit of a bummer. The regular and strawberry limeade tasted watered down and not sweet. The gilroy mac and cheese was garlicy and way better than the jalapeno popper, but both felt like something was missing. The honey butter that came with the biscuit was again the highlight of the meal. The biscuit itself, while pillowy, warm and delightfully biscuit scented, was also dissapointingly tasteless. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things or it was an off day.< /Review>

It was served hot and stayed hot until I finished eating it.  It was good but not the best Mac & Cheese I have ever had. I had lobster mac and I wish I could remember where. The wife had the brussel sprouts that she said were overcooked. She also had a side biscuit with honey butter. It was so good the oldest child ordered another for herself. Overall it was good, not sure how you can fail when all you do is basically one dish.</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332< /GmapID></record>

Portion size is great.
Parking will most likely be a couple of blocks down or away, unless you get lucky.
There are two aspects to this restaurant. Dine in is in one location. Take out is in another the next block over. Staff at the Dine in location were not friendly. I waited there about 10 to 15 min before someone offered to help me. That gentleman was great, walked me down to the other location. Apologized. Explained why it's split and what the business is trying to do. When I went to the take out side the staff was Amazing and super friendly.

I'd go here again if I was with someone else and they wanted to try it or if I was picking up an order again for the company.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Had a party of 5 and everyone got a different flavored Mac n cheese. The 5 we got were all okay, nothing anyone was in love with or I don't think spectacular enough to be your whole meal. Maybe would be more palletable if you added in 3-4 additions, but then your $12-14 entree becomes $20.< /Review><rate>3< /rate><Response>None</Response>< time>

Hands down the best mac n cheese in the Bay! Homeroom gives you an amazing comfort food experience with stellar service and sooo many different options. Way more high quality than we had anticipated, but safe to say we were more than pleasantly surprised…great location, amazing food, anyone and everyone should make a visit.< /text>

<Review>Incredible! Mac n cheese is out of this world with so many choices to choose from. Not the healthiest but definitely good for the soul. While expensive, it is very tasty, and is enough food for 2 meals. I try to go there at least a couple times a year and it’s a great spot to go with friends or dates!< /Review>< Name>

YUMMY!!! It’s mac n’ cheese at its best! What stands out is that it’s not an over the top kind of mnc, but more old school. Hence, their name. You can order as simple or as loaded as you want. They also have signature blends, but I went with the classic with broccoli and scallions. My kids had bacon and breadcrumbs and ITWASEVERYTHING!!! Portions are huge! One order can easily feed two unless you don’t want to share :). We also ordered the brussel sprouts with bacon and it did not disappoint. Definitely a repeat and worth the drive from the city. And not to be missed, their service was top notch. Well done!< /Review>

<review>This place was recommend by a friend. I took me and my son. My son got the Smoked Bacon mac-n-cheese and I the Classic and added bacon. Really good food. Our bill was kinda "Ridiculous!" $29.09 for 2 bowls of Mac-n-cheese and water. Not recommend for a budget oriented family!!!< /review><gmap_id>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332< /gmap_id></record>

<Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332< /GmapID><review>I came here after work with my friend that chose this place. She was running late, so I had to wait outside. It seemed odd to me that the restaurant was empty, but they wouldn't let me sit inside and order. Their waiting area is outside, so it was unbearably hot. When my friend came, we were seated immediately.

We both ordered the garlic mac and cheese with breadcrumbs. I ordered a pink professor drink too. The mac and cheese was really good. It was creamy and super cheesy. My drink was okay, it tasted like a plain pink lemonade if anything. It didn't really go well with the mac and cheese. The total came out to be almost $20 per mac and cheese. This is pretty expensive, even coming from SF downtown.

While the mac and cheese is good, I don't think there's anything that makes it worth the price. Parking is pretty bad here, but it's relatively close to the bart stop. I don't think I'll be coming back due to the prices.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<response>None< /response><text>We got it togo because the like was still quite long at around 5 pm surprisingly. There is an abundance of cheese in the mac as you can see. we got both the jalapeño and the garlic to try. Both flavors were distinct and came through very well with the mac. My only dislike is really the mac itself. The texture and bite felt very starchy and grainy. It wasn’t the springiness I was expecting to counter the thick cheese. Overall one of the best in the bay still, but my search for the perfect mac and cheese continues.<//text></record></dataset><record>
<text>Tried this place for the first time on a Sunday morning and waited about 45 minutes to get a table. If it wasn’t for our friends’ recommendation, I wouldn’t have stayed; so glad we did. Besides it being a little difficult to hear each other over the conversations at other tables, the environment is laid back & inclusive. The spicy crab mac n cheese is the best I’ve ever had!

This was recommended as a great local place and probably our favorite food of the trip! The mac & cheese was amazing and their customer service was unbeatable! We will definitely make a point to return if we visit again! Best macaroni cheese ever! Such a nice spread of toppings, great service, good beer too and a homemade Oreo cookie which is to die for! Huge portions too! Would definitely return :)</text>

<review>the crab mac is my favorite !! you can definitely taste the crab, it's mixed in really well. it's the most expensive mac on the menu (i think) but it comes with breadcrumbs and bell pepper inside it! also, the portions here are h u g e, so this can definitely be shared between two people comfortably.  if i get a mac on my own, i always end up having a second meal (would recommend sharing though, it's not *as* good the second day).<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<review>If you love creamy macaroni and cheese, you'll love Homeroom. To avoid the crowd, try a mid-week lunch. Portions are generous, so come with an appetite, plan to split, or take some home to enjoy later. The bacon Mac is just right. Smoky bacon and cheese? Yes, please!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I came in with a group of three pretty late into the night but the service was enthusiastic and friendly. We were not rushed and when our server noticed that our table was wobbly, she handled it immediately before we even mentioned it. The staff were so sweet and friendly and the food was amazing. I like the Gilroy Garlic (r.i.p.) and the Pizza Mac. Sangria was also delicious.< /Text>

Great restaurant for eating lots of different styles of Mac and Cheese. I drank a strawberry margarita, had chicken and bacon Mac and Cheese, and a mint chip ice cream cake to finish.

Everything was delicious and service was great, as kept on checking to make sure Bay everything was okay. There is a 10% service charge that’s automatically included regardless of how many you are (even for me which was only one person), but I think that is totally fine and fair and I still tipped the regular amount on top of it.

This is a restaurant I wouldn’t mind going back to again next time I’m in Oakland. Keep up the great work!< /Text>

This is a favorite of mine. This place definitely opened my eyes to Mac N Cheese. This place has a modern twist on American comfort food. Definitely recommend that you check this place out. I just don't recommend the buffalo wings sauce... It's just too much (great if you want to feel like you just ate 20 buffalo wings). Portions are big, you can easily share<//Text>

This is my favorite mac and cheese place and every time I go it does not disappoint. They offer a lot of different combinations that they've created for you, but you can always order a basic mac and cheese and add-on any of the large variety of toppings that they have. I usually don't get many toppings but I think that the one thing I always get is bread crumbs on top of my mac and cheese, which is an essential.< /Text>

Good, but no idea why this place is so famous, popular, and crowded. It seems to me that it's a social effect more than because of the quality of the food. Their mac & cheese is really good, sure, but not that special imho. I wouldn't go if I did not live nearby... But the worst part is that the service sucks! I went twice and both times the employees seemed so entitled by the fact that they are successful that they could not give a sh*t about the guests. That being said, I am not deducting more than 1 star because, after writing another negative review on Square, I did get a response from the restaurant. Therefore, it seems to me that the owners really do care, but their employees are not so good at customer support! I will go again, and I am happy for the success of a local business.</text>

Had a great menu for rich comfort food, good vibes, and the drinks are delicious! Perfect for non vegans and vegetarians. But if you are a vegan the mac n cheese option isn't the best. I mean if your going just for brunch drinks def the perfect place. But, if you're looking for a great vegan mac n cheese you're better off with a box of dayia from whole foods.<//Text>

I had the vegan mac and cheese which was smokey but not super creamy. I had the brownie sundae which was fantastic. A dense brownie with lots of syrup. Overall the atmosphere was lively and busy. Would eat again!</Review>

<review>Amazing food and great service! Chalk outside for the little kids and big kids too! Got some biscuits with honey butter to share, then the jalapeño popper mac with pulled pork to share with my husband. Kids each got a kid sized bowl of mac and cheese and we finished it all off with a slice of peanut butter pie! So delicious! Worth a trip if it's out of the way for you.</review>< Date>

Came here while I was in the area since friend had raved about it. The place gets busy, when we got here our wait was only about 20 mins or so. Got the chicken pot pie Mac and cheese and the gilroy garlic with bacon. Interesting selections. Both cans pipping hot. Enjoyed the chicken pot pie; the garlic with bacon was good too. Fun place to try if you happened to be in the area.< /Text>

There was nothing spectacular about this place. I went for the first time and got the Gilroy Garlic mac. Maybe I'm just not a huge mac & cheese person, but it was just alright. I couldn't really taste any strong garlic flavor and kind of wish I got something else.

The plus side is that the serving size is HUGE and enough for 2 meals, so you can take some home! The staff was attentive and nice and gave us two glasses full of ice for our water as it was extremely hot that day!

Might try it again.</review>

<gmapID>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332<//gmapID><review>This place has amazing food. We arrived here on a Saturday evening around like 7ish. We had to wait about an hour to 45 mins to get a table. I would say this is the only downside to this place but it is worth the food you get for it. The tables may be a shared community table sometimes. You can specify to the staff if you want outdoor seating or a private table instead. They also had heaters for the outside seating.

Coming to the food, it is too good. We got a Gilroy garlic Mac and cheese with mushroom toppings. Make sure to ask for bread crumbs on it. We took 2 sides, fried peas and house made buttermilk biscuit.  I cannot describe the deliciousness. The Mac and cheese was better than any Mac and cheese I've ever eaten. The buttermilk biscuit with honey is one of a kind. I just loved it.

We ordered their peanut butter pie for desert abd ordered beers to go with our food. This place did not disappoint. It is a must try!

One other thing to note, the neighborhood is known for car break-ins and thefts. It is worth parking a bit far away and walking to the restaurant. We found a paid parking nearby for our car. At least we could eat our food in peace without worrying about our car.< /review>< Time>

<text>This is my favorite restaurant in Oakland! On weekends, there's a wait, and for good reason. My go-to order is the classic Mac with grilled chicken and breadcrumbs, which I daydream about. This time, I tried the garlic Mac, and it is also amazing! Their Mac and cheese is always so creamy and perfectly salty. The Mac the goat is also a great lighter alternative for those who don't want something too heavy. They give large portions too so I feel the price, albeit a little expensive, is worth it. Honestly, if I was on my deathbed, this restaurant would probably be my last meal.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<text>I love homeroom. The food is great, but the location is small so there can be a lengthy wait for seating. The service is fast, however. The extensive list of add-on items you can choose from to customize your choice of mac & cheese makes each dish unique and just the way you want it. Very rich and satisfying, I usually end up having leftovers. Highly recommend.< /text>< pictures>

A must stop every time I’m in the East Bay! Massive portions, perfectly balanced flavors and lots of flexibility for GF, DF and vegetarian eaters. Gilroy Garlic, aged white cheddar, spinach artichoke and Buffalo Macs are phenomenal. Haven’t tried the homemade Oreo, but heard great things.< /text>

Let me start by saying how much I hate being in the Bay Area, in general.  It is, hands down, my second least favorite place in this planet.  This restaurant makes it worth it to go down there.  The food is the best I've ever had (don't tell my mom), and it's reasonably priced.  The staff is always super helpful and friendly, and I wish I could clone the whole operation and move it closer to me!</text>

<Text>I had their mac & cheese back in like 2009? when they had a stand at the eat real festival in Jack London. It was fantastic, but it was served in a small bowl, the way mac & cheese should be (IMHO) I was super excited for them to open, but when they did, the price was pretty steep so I just didn't bother. I have grabbed take out 3-4 times over the years and it's OK, but not worth the price. (at least in my opinion). I mean, you do get a lot of food, but it's just mac & cheese, and it's only OK. Don't get me wrong, it's way better than boxed stuff, and a lot of people love it. I am not one of them. I will say this, if you need a side dish for a backyard BBQ or a potluck or whatever, their food would really shine. Because as good as mac & cheese is, it's way too rich for a main course. It tastes much MUCH better when it's balanced with a separate, starchless, vegetable and maybe a protein. This is just my opinion, eat what you want. Honestly I haven't been there in a while. If they offer a complete meal (entrée, with vegetables & mac as sides) , I would give them another shot.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

It was okay. I wasn't blown away by the macaroni I had. Plus (and this is more of my own issue with being a human being) I can't do the crowds. So if you're like me, an antisocial plebian, this might not be the place for you.
But it's fine if you like macaroni and cheese (you probably will)< /review>

Friendly service, nice spots to sit outside, and great food! Their garlic mac (the most popular) is well-done with breadcrumbs. We also ordered their homemade oreo cookie which had some of the best chocolate cookies I've had in a while!<//text>

Fun place!  Any restaurant dedicated to the wonderfulness of mac-n-cheese is a good thing. Variety of dishes to choose from - vegetarian or not. The drink list is also quite interesting.</Review>

It's really hard to go wrong here except with their bacon Brussels sprouts. While the flavor is killer they are however dripping in oil. They were super tasty but all the oil in them made me feel sick after i ate it.<//Review>

Who doesn't like homeroom? Their garlic mac and cheese with bread crumbs is to die for. The only thing to know before going here is to make sure not to eat for about a day before. Their portion sizes are so large that I can never finish one order on my own in one sitting. The food is just great and if you haven't tried it yet, you really need to.< /Text>

Who knew macaroni and cheese could be so varied and delicious! This place has a relaxed urban atmosphere and offers an  unique approach to this comfort food classic. Our party of 4 ordered different varieties and shared bites. I found all 4 delicious, especially the buffalo chicken version. I highly recommend this place, but  do check their hours before you go as they are only open for part of the day.<//text>

I like my mac and cheese but the servings are too large. Can that be? Yes, it is so filling. It's good but I don't like to eat that much in one sitting. I do bring the leftover home, but I'd much rather be served a better portion. But they do make it very well here.<//text>

This place is mac and cheese central. No vegan mac on the menu yet though. Big hearty pasta is used to start. They have several sauce options, like a Gouda based mac, a buffalo, a cheddar a garlic, etc. You can customize your own Mac or choose from the tested and loved premade choices. You can add in veggies like broccoli or shrooms, meats like bacon or chicken, and toppings like crushed potatoes chips or breadcrumbs( and many more add ons) that get baked together in a piping hot dish. One order is enough for 2 to split, or have leftovers to take home. Or it's enough for a super hungry person. They have a few good sides and salads. They also have great dessert options. They are busy all the time and for good reason. Great comfort food! They also have a takeout counter one block over if you don't want to wait. They have outdoor seating with heaters and if you have a group larger than 4 call ahead. Kid friendly, great service.</Text>

<review>I know this might be just another splash in the hype train but I truly love this place. It is such a good concept. It brings back happy childhood memories with an adult take of sophisticated flavors and taste. There truly is something for everyone with the endless combinations of mac and cheese.<//review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Do you dream of having something...more? Do you often find yourself wishing for something unique or *extra special* to add zest and excitement to your life? Then this is the place for you! Taking a regular household side dish and escalating it to a never-before-seen layer of decadence, these Mac and cheese plates will wow you with pizzazz. Garlic goodness? No problem! Spicy supremes? You got it! Meat madness? BRING IT ON! At Homeroom, you will not only be wowed by the creativity, but you will be taken on a flavorful journey that stands the test of time, ensuring this to be a place of tradition- passed down generation upon generation until your great grandchildren will say... wow, thanks for taking me to homeroom.<//Text><rating>4</rating><Resp>None</Resp><name>Priscilla R< /name><Date>1562449754921</Date>< Gmap_id>

This is one of my favorite places ever. 🧀🧀🧀

My favorite dishes are the chicken bacon ranch mac and the buffalo chicken mac. Really you can't go wrong. I especially love eating outside and chatting with friends.

A good tip on a busy evening is to sit at the community table, same food and atmosphere with quicker service.</review>

My wife and I went here and I ordered the vegan Mac and she had the garlic one. Both were really good and it was the best vegan mac and cheese I have ever had. The service was also really friendly and very helpful and knew which toppings are vegan. Definitely coming back.< /Text>

<review>I'm full and ready for a nap! But in all seriousness glad we stumbled upon this little gem. So many food choices and add on's. I got the Jalapeño and cheese added some chicken and spinach. While my boyfriend got the Gilroy garlic and added chicken as well. We also ordered the biscuits that come with this honey butter which is so scrumptiously good. And two Sangria's to wash it down with. We came on a Sunday afternoon 20 min  wait. Parking is neighborhood only and the next block to go is Homeroom-to-go which we'll probably try that the next time we're in the mood for some good Mac n Cheese!< /review><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Do not miss this mac & cheese restaurant. I have their cookbook, which is also excellent, and is the reason I wanted to come so badly. I wasn't disappointed. The Brussels sprouts were nothing special, but the garlic mac with bacon and artichoke hearts for mix-ins, paired with a dry cider, was divine. I wanted to try dessert, but was too full. The portions are big, so either split one or take your leftovers with you.<//text>< pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>It's Mac n Cheese. It's delicious. You can customize most dishes to your liking. The beer/wine selection is good.

You should definitely check in via their Yelp integration to save time. There is almost always a line, so plan ahead. Prices are on the steeper end for comfort food, but they promise to pay their servers an actual living wage. All in all, if you love Mac n Cheese (how could you not?), you have to give this place a shot.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The food was amazing, I had the  jalapeño popper mac and my boyfriend had the garlic mac and for dessert we had the peanut butter pie. The waiter had great recommendations and was right about adding the topping to the garlic.  The staff was very friendly, after I mentioned it was my boyfriends bday the waiter put a candle in our pie and sang my boyfriend happy birthday.< /Text>

Not a single negative thing to say about homeroom, except that another customer must have lit up half way through our meal because it smelled heavily of weed for about 20 minutes. It's a shame because I was trying to bask in the glory of the hot pepper popper mac n cheese.<//text>

If I could rate lower I would. We waited 45 mins for our drinks. We had to ask for them. My food took almost an hour to come out. They brought out the wrong dish for my husband. It took an hour and a half to come out correctly.

They did comp his meal.< /review>

Wow this place is mac and cheese heaven. You did not know something as simple as  mac and cheese could be so much more. The different flavors are amazing and all the dishes really are the definition of gourmet. If you want the supreme comfort food, this is the place.</review>

This was my second time coming to this place and unfortunately was met with bad service. I arrived at 9:30pm with group of 5 and was told the wait time was between 15-20 minutes, which was fine since ONLINE it says they close at 11pm on Saturday and we would still have enough time to order and enjoy our food. We waited 30 minutes and once seated we were told the kitchen closes at 10pm so we only had TWO minutes to order and that we had to leave by 10:30 because due to "security reasons" they have to lock up at 10:30pm. We were all surprised by this and let her know we were not told this while we waited, but even then she didn't feel bad. On top of that, to seem apologetic, the hostess gave us 10% off each order but we were still charged a 10% service fee, cancelling each other out. I don't recommend coming here in the evening and I won't be returning.<//Text>

Heard about this place forever and finally got to enjoy it.  It did not disappoint.  In fact, the food was delicious - they really upped the game on mac and cheese.  I tried their buffalo chicken mac with broccoli.  It was so good, I brought an extra order home for the family.

Their iced coffee and peanut butter pie hit the spot on that warm afternoon.

The service was awesome.  Attentive without being overbearing.  I brought my 3 months old puppy and sat on the patio. The staff brought him water in his own dish!

I will definitely be back!< /review>

Because they're so good, it's often hard to find a parking place close, but especially at peak meal times it's tricky to find a table. They do not accept reservations.< /Review>< pics>

Best Mac N' Cheese in the city. They have a good variety of Mac N' Cheese combinations. The place is busy but is definitely the wait, very few places I would say are worth the wait. It's a must if you like Mac N' Cheese and even if you don't because maybe you will start enjoying after having theirs.<//text>

Seasonal items are offered as well to showcase the freshest produce. Try to come at off peak times since the dinner rush is real or walk down the block to the take out spot since they have a few available tables.</review>< pics>

Really good, enough food for two to share one order. If you don't and you pick whatever you want the bill will grow quickly. Lunch for 2 was about 100 but that's because it was our first time and we wanted to try alot. It was really good food but beware the belly!!< /review>

<review>If you are planning to come to homeroom for the first time simple know that it is a small and close seating plan and that reservations are not available. With those out of the way, also be sure to wear some looser pants because it's hard to resist eating all their Mac and cheese. This place has been a go to for my wife and I for the past 4 years and while not a common occurrence, it's been great every time we've gone.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

This ain't the  Craft mac n' cheese your mom used to make. Homeroom takes a simple comfort food and amps it up a notch. My favorite is the Buffalo Chicken Mac, Hearty Salad and wash it down with and Arnold Palmer.

Make sure to take a jacket if you go on a cold day. It can be a little airy.</Review>

<text>Don't think about the calorie count, just enjoy the amazing variety of Mac and cheese you can get at this place. I enjoyed the goat cheese and scallion combination (of course I had to add bacon), but it was hard to decide with all the fantastic options available. You can even get potato chips on top! The salads and drink options are creative and delicious, too. It's a popular spot, so show up early!< /text><gmapID>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332<//gmapID>< Pics>

The wait is pretty long to both order and to get your food, but IT IS SO WORTH IT. I love mac & cheese, and this place is so so good. Their gluten free pasta is delicious, they have some awesome beverages to choose from, and my lactose-intolerant body is so happy with the vegan cheese option. If you are in Oakland, you need to grab some Homeroom. I love their food.</review>

Mac n cheese perfected. Service is quick and attentive, and the beer floats are innovative and fun, but the highlight of homeroom is obviously their mac n cheese. It's always rich, creamy, filling, and intensely flavorful. Can't recommend this place enough.< /text>

I honestly don’t understand all the good reviews. Gave it 2 chances and it is seriously disgusting. The noodles are not thoroughly cooked. The bread crumbs are weird and taste gross. It really lacks flavor. I am not a picky eater and this was inedible. I really wanted to like this place.<//text>

The mac and cheese is off the charts..then add some bacon...wow...kids loved , I even loved it and heck I'm a steak guy...lol...the service was outstanding and the wait was only 10 minutes, which considering the place was packed is not bad in my opinion...and best thing it was well worth the wait.</text>

<userid>112903012531757785732< /userid><text>This is really an experience. More likely than not, I believe the line forms before they even open with paid actors /actresses just to create a demand. However, they prepare you with sidewalk chalk 😛, cause you will be waiting outside with seating if early enough. But the food, is worth the wait. I've had the regular Mac and cheese with bacon chicken and bread crumbs, and was very pleased. But since becoming vegetarian, I appreciate them more. The jalapeño popper Mac and cheese is delicious. But the vegan Mac was not the business. Oh and there is a homemade Oreo cookie somewhere.< /text>< user_name>

I would give this place 10 stars if I could! Best Mac n Cheese I have ever had! Their menu is perfectly sized. Not too big, not too small. I have tried the Mexican flavored one as well as the jalapeño one. Beyond perfect! The service is great as well. Reyna was super friendly, helpful, and prompt. I'll be recommending this place to all of friends.< /Text>

The menu is full of delicious variation on macaroni and cheese. If you don't see something that piques your interest, you can choose your own addition to the classic dish.

The seating is somewhat limited, and you're likely to have a wait, especially for a larger party. But the staff is friendly and accommodating.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

A little overrated but the Mac is some good Mac. I would go back again but I think they might need to add more to their beer menu, as millennial as that might sound. Alright place overall but very busy. Take out might be a bit better than eating at the restaurant, and a little quicker. Understand from the location they have it would be busy but I might lean more towards carry out next time.< /text>

Second time eating here and was surprised that I liked it better the second time! It's been about 2 years since I first visited but their menu has seriously improved and there's more meat choices now. Always a fun place to bring people from out of town who are visiting.<//review>

A well-known, local favorite stop for creative variations of the classic Mac n' Cheese. I visited the main restaurant which was busy, and the Chicken Pot Pie Mac n' Cheese was good on a cold January night. Although it wasn't 5-star quality it was good enough to keep me curious and determined to come again and try something else. The service was good, although oddly they seemed rushed to seat the two of us. Normally I enjoy quick service but perhaps because they were eager to wedge us between crowded tables it came off slightly pushy. We eventually were comfortably seated outside under warmers and it was nice! Will definitely be back.< /text>

I'll start with the good, the food was great though. I highly recommend the iced tea (and I'm not an iced tea type of girl)! The reason I didn't give 5 stars is the service was sooo slow and our waiter was really awkward. Try to avoid peak hours as it's a super popular place, and if you're not interested in waiting, they have a takeout shop down the street!</Review>

Cute, likely spot with scrumptious vegan options and awesome brews, too! We had them cater our wedding rehearsal lunch and I can say that decision was in my top 3 I made in wedding planning. Everyone loved it and was so excited to have so many types of Mac and cheese!

Only reason I give 4 rather than 5 stars is that the wait for sit-down is a pain.. happy they're getting such spectacular business though. Long live Homeroom!< /text>

Very, very cheesy. I had the buffalo chicken mac and cheese, and it wasn't very good at all. Way too much hot sauce. The other mac and cheeses are my table were good though, especially the garlic one.< /Review>

This place has a really fun vibe (evident by the name).  Parking was easy and service was swift.

Cost is a little on the high-side for a mac n' cheese dish (even considering they're gourmet), but it was pretty tasty and doable for an occasional treat.  We had the 'Smoked Cheddar and Bacon', and 'Mexican.' Both we super creamy and cheesy, filled with the appropriate topping, and quite filling.

Their sangria iced coffee weren't bad, either.<//Review>

<review>I had heard a LOT of hype about Homeroom before I actually got to try it, so my expectations were pretty low.  I've also had some transcendent mac n' cheese experiences (Beecher's in Seattle), so the bar is pretty high.  I was very skeptical.

Homeroom exceeded expectations and I reluctantly had to cave in to the hype.  This is legit.  We ordered the classic mac n' cheese with chicken, and the white cheddar mac n' cheese, both with breadcrumbs.  We also got some of the brussels sprouts.  Everything was delicious.  I have to say I think the chicken was superfluous; the mac n' cheese is plenty filling without it, and it really didn't add a whole lot.

Everything was just amazing and delicious and I want to go back.  I can't really say much else.  Oh yeah, good beer.< /review>< userid>

<Text>Mediocre at best. I don't see how they have such a following. It's Mac n Cheese for Pete's sake and mine is definitely better. Our waitress was horrible and it took her a very long time before she circled back so we could ask for our check However, in the meantime another staff member offered to refill my tea and that was nice. Not sure if it's worth giving it another try.<//Text>< pics>

My personal favorite is the Sriracha Mac, though it may not be on the menu now. Honorable mention to Jalapeno Mac, for both tasting like its namesake and being good Mac.

The desserts are delicious too. In fact, the only thing this place is bad for is your waistline! Well, I should mention that it gets unreasonably crowded at peak times.</Review><username>Chuck McIntyre< /username>< UserId.>

A unique, first experience for me.  Lovely server.  Delicious food.  NOISY! But no problem.  I had the Buffalo Chicken mac 'n cheese.  Loved it!  If I had to criticize,  the pasta was too aldente, but that's a matter of individual preference.  Enjoy!</Review>

<Review>It's Saturday. Me and my party were seated at 10pm, under the impression that is closed at 11pm. Once we were seated we were told we had to be out of the door by 10:30pm for "security" reasons. In addition, our waiter mentioned we had 2 minutes to order because the kitchen closed at 10pm. I had been here before during the day and all was well and the food was not disappointing. Unfortunately it was my parties first time there and the first impression was a disaster and rude to say the least. I don't want to come back.< /Review><user_name>Angel Ramirez</user_name><pictures>None</pictures>< Date>

Very expensive and we had to park several blocks away and walk. But, it is good mac & cheese. A little bummed that they did not have my favorite anymore, but I was satisfied with my alternative. Good for an occasional treat.< /review>

If you're ever craving mac n cheese or you just aren't sure what you want and you're in the Oakland area, definitely stop by at Homeroom and get you some mac n cheese! They've got a pretty good selection of options on their menu which provides variety from buffalo chicken, bacon ranch, jalapeño popper, or if you want something on the "healthier" side, there are options with crab/spicy crab with peppers onions and parsley, and my personal favorite - the macximus, which has artichoke hearts and spinach with shallots feta and Jack cheese. The Macximus is truly one you can't go wrong with, but in reality all of their options seem to have great flavor and even look aesthetically appealing. They've got some adult beverages but if you don't drink they also have some very refreshing limeade's and iced teas, I highly recommend the paradise tea which is essentially a black hibiscus tea, it doesn't halve any sweetener, but you don't even need to add sugar! On a final note. I'd like to take this moment to appreciate their staff for their diligence and efficiency, as well as their great customer service. Besides our server, I noticed every other employee working hard to take care of their customers, from the host getting us seated - which, mind you it was really busy and looked like the wait was at least 30mins but we got seated in about 10 maybe 15mins tops. The service is truly great, the food came out pretty quick, and the entrees are pretty big!  You won't regret going to Homeroom, I guarantee it.</Text>

I'm conflicted on what to say here. The food was tasty and the staff friendly, but the customer service was a bit out of wack.

We started by ordering for the kids as we didn't want a meltdown in the restaurant by hangry children. This caused a bit of confusion as they have to put the whole table in at once. The server had to ask the cooks if they could accommodate this request...really? But they could and all was ok.

We ordered the classic Mac and cheese for the kids...one bite and they pushed it away and refused to eat it. The issue wasn't that it was bad, but they didn't like the flavor. We called the server over and explained the situation and asked to replace it with another meal. The server explained that since we ordered it there was nothing he could do, but he'd be happy to get something else for the kids. And for our inconvenience, he would give us a free dessert. Again, really? What restaurant doesn't return a dish if you don't like it (again, literally one bite was removed). It's like like we ate 1/2 the dish then tried to argue we wanted our money back. And we ended up ordering a replacement dish that was 2x as expensive.

Then they had to check again to see if they could make a regular dish in a kids size...no. not a big deal, but not sure why that was a problem. And we ordered one dish without breadcrumbs, and it still came with them..again, no big deal, but it was one more thing.

So in the end we ordered a dessert that was almost as expensive as the kids meal. If they had just refunded us the money for the kids meal, we still would have spent a lot more, and the evening wouldn't have been tainted.<//Review>

<Review>Their White Cheddar was so salty as to be completely inedible. Seriously. My girlfriend was unhappy with her order, so I took it thinking "oh, that's not so bad, I like salty things." No. It was disgusting and inedible. Gross.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>The Mac N Cheese was good but three plates and three sodas cost us $65! There isn't a Mac N Cheese on earth worth that kind of money. Advice....don't price yourself out of the market. At the end of the day, you're just selling fancy pasta.<//Review>< time>

I was just totally blown away at how consistently good EVERYTHING was at Homeroom. My friends and I had the Buffalo Chicken mac and cheese, Gilroy Garlic Mac and Cheese with chicken and caramelized onions, and the spinach artichoke Mac and Cheese with added chicken. Oh and we had the minty peas. Unreal!! Absolutely phenomenal and will definitely be back  - probably WAY more than my waistline would like!</Review>

Life changing comfort food. I came here on a Sunday with a line out the door. I waited 5 minutes and passed the time looking at an English Bulldog sleeping beneath a table. Always nice to know a place is dog friendly. We got in quick because we told them we were fine sitting anywhere, so they put us at the "counter". Scare quotes around this because it's not a proper counter, more the flat surface atop a divider separating the dining room from the register and work area. There was no leg room so if you're tall, don't sit here.

I got the buffalo chicken Mac and front the first bite I knew I couldn't tell my dad that I'd been here and discovered a Mac n Cheese better than his. It was rich and creamy with just the right amount of cayenne kick and tang from the Frank's Redhot they use. The chicken was perfect and I don't say that lightly. American chicken is almost universally overcooked but the tiny cubes in my dish were tender and m**st. It came with breadcrumbs on top and a tasteful amount of ranch. I took the second half home and ate it for dinner making homeroom account for 2/3 of my meals that day.

I told others that I had finally been to Homeroom and they acted like I had just entered the real world. I was now party of the people in the know. Join the club.</Text>

I come here often. The line is always wrapped around the block and I will wait every time because I know that I will leave happy. Say you can't pick a plate off of their menu, you have the ability to become the mac n cheese master and create your own special concoction. I recommend the bacon mac or the white cheddar.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Homey, simple, and bustling restaurant with a sense of flair, diversity and comfort thata welcoming. Some of the dishes can be a bit pricey, but it damn well is worth the cost. If youre a fan of comfort food, you owe it to yourself to try Homeroom.<//Text>

Relish!  I have been here many times and always order one of two dishes,  the popper and the Buffalo Chicken.  This time,  my friend and I decided to try all new ones.  We tried the chorizo one the Maximus and the Gilroy garlic.  I have to say they are all delicious!  The brownie sundae was just as good!  If you've not been there,  you must go!< /review>

Awesome Mac n Cheese place. The quantity of food is also surprisingly big. So big that they'll give you a gold star for finishing (pretty difficult). There's also great sides to go along with the mac n cheese, such as the roasted brussel sprouts.< /Text>

It's a restaurant entirely devoted to macaroni and cheese, which happens to be my (vegetarian) wife's favorite dish. Had the Hawaiian Mac (the special at the time) and loved it! Generous portions and hearty, tasty food.< /Text>

Not a huge mac n cheese fan but this place was good. The portion sizes are huge so you’ll likely have leftovers to be microwaved at home. I had the Jalepeno Poppers amd wished it had more jalepeno peppers so add more kick to the dish (disclaimer: I love spicy food)< /Text>

Besides the amazingly delicious and creative mac n cheese menu, the old-school tables, chairs, and chalkboard walls takes you back to (hopefully good) memories of grade school. Our server was very friendly and checked on us often. The wait isn’t as long as it seems when people are waiting outside of the restaurant, however, it’s most likely because they will place a few small groups at the large tables.<//review>

Delish!

I had the original, my date had the spicy.  So. Good.

The ambiance was cool (check out the photos in the bathroom).  Parking was easy.  Prices were okay (a bit on the high side).  This place only serves Mac & Cheese...so the wait time is quick because the macaroni is always prepared and waiting for you.

Totally hipster, but fun.</Review>

If you like baked Mac n cheese with 🦀, Italian sausage, or fried 🐔 you have found salvation. They got more added offerings like bacon and such so you have plenty to choose from and share. I'd also say the portions are big. Two people can easily share one or put one person into comatose. As a added knock out punch, they got a good craft 🍺 selection on tap and bottle, 🍷, sangria, and mimosa. These guys make keeping it cheesy look easy. Cheesy?<//Review></record></dataset><record>

If you are a Mac fan, must visit this. The garlic Mac was yummy. The jalapeño one was maybe a little overdone, bread crumbs on the top smelt and tasted burnt.  The Arnold Palmer (non alcoholic) I had was great! Good that it was one of the few places open at 4 PM. Too few non Mac options. So walk in if you are ready to have Mac n say cheese!<//Review>

Showed up at 9:35 PM, 25 minutes prior to their posted close time of 10 PM... After waiting at the host stand for 5 minutes,  we were informed that they stopped seating at 9:30 PM. I sited the 10 PM advertised close time,  and I didn't say it,  but in my 45 years I've never experienced a restaurant that wouldn't seat to a reasonable time before close.  The restaurant was 75% full and clearly going to have guests well beyond 10 PM. The host kindly said he'd ask the manager if they could make an exception.   This was kindly appreciated given our first visit to this abode; unfortunately, the manager recited their policy. I said,  "Yeah,  we were five minutes  late then,  but it's our first time here.  Any chance... ?"  No luck!  I suggest they change their closing time to 9:30 PM, and honor seating like every other restaurant until their posted time of closing.  Their convenience is obviously more important than the customer!   I figure I'll never try their food now,  given this poor service experience.   What if I'd have been a food critic wearing my "press badge"?  That would have likely illicited the kitchen staying open till midnight.  I just think (within reason) that businesses should try to meet their customers!  Oh, though I've never tried it,  I'm sure that the removal of the 'truffle mac' was more for the savings of the business,  than the upset fan base that were told it was removed to 'save you - the customer's - money'.  That point rang in my mind (see their website) as we were casually turned away!< /Text>

In love! Typically not a huge fan of cheesy things but man, hands down the best mac and cheese I have ever had. It comes fresh out of the oven and topped with bread crumbs. It's not overly cheesy and it's creamy and full of flavor. I ordered the white cheddar Mac. I got to get a spoonful of my friends plates of the garlic Mac, classic Mac, and jalapeño popper. I loved all or them but i have a simple palate so the white cheddar and classic Macs were my favorite. I don't think you can go wrong any of the Macs, just pick whatever you crave for that night.<//Text>

<Text>If you like mac and cheese, you need to come here!  I like it spicy, so I usually get the exchange student or jalapeno popper mac.  They do have community tables which makes seating faster for small parties of two or three (with the added bonus of random conversations with strangers).<//Text>< Pics>

Why pay $12 for Mac and cheese? Because it’s totally worth it at homeroom. There’s no other way I’d want to die of diabetes and overeating than coming to Homeroom. Thank God there’s no nutrition menu. Make sure to always get breadcrumbs on your Mac and cheese and order the Gilroy garlic. Your breath will stink for a while so pack gum and a toothbrush with toothpaste. A must try for anyone passing through or living in Oakland, or honestly fly out and try it it’s pretty damn good<//Review>

Staff was great. I got the spicy Crab special which was tasty. My other half whom is lactose intolerant got the vegan. He tells me the vegan tastes terrible. When the waitress came back around she inquired as to why he was not eating his. He informed her of how he felt and ended up getting the salad. A gent came up to us and informed us that they were not going to charge us for the vegan and the salad is put in. He even says it was wonderful service and will go back.< /text>

The downside is mainly the wait. It's practically impossible to not have to wait something like half an hour to eat here.

Some of their mac and cheese options aren't as good as others. The simple ones are generally OK, but some like the ones with sriracha aren't as good of a combination.</text>< resp>

Really good taste, but very heavy and creamy. One mac n cheese can probably be sufficient for two people. I like ordering from the website and the fly lane where you park your car outside and they get you your pick up order. Thumbs up!<//text>

We have had many meals at Oliveto's--upstairs and downstairs! Never have we been disappointed. Our last visit was November 2016. The pasta dishes are authentic. The wine list is extensive. The ambience is relaxing and yet elegant. The wait staff is knowledgeable and helpful.<//text>

<Review>This. Is. The. Best. Meal. You. Will. Ever. Have. This place has ruined all other mac and cheese for me it is too good. I usually get the Gilroy garlic with breadcrumbs but you cant go wrong with any of their macs. As if it couldn't get any better their starters and desserts are amazing too. I highly recommend their brussel sprouts. I also recommend going recommend going at an off time as the wait can get long (although next door is 1234 go records which is a fantastic record shop!) My one complaint that isnt that big of a deal is that their water tends to be lukewarm so ask for ice. If I could give them 100 stars I would this place is magic.<//Review><user_name>Melissa Lager< /user_name>< Response>

<Review>If I could choose anything, I would give it 4.5 stars.  The brownie was good, and the smoky bacon (with broccoli) entree was one of the most insanely delicious macaroni and cheese dishes I've ever eaten.  That said, the white cheddar mac was only okay, so definitely order the other dish.  The service was competent and the prices were quite reasonable considering the gigantic portions offered.<//Review>< pictures>

<text>Though I'm not a fan of the sides (nearly raw broccoli, bitter greens literally swimming in ranch dressing, $2 for a single biscuit), there is no denying the outstanding quality and taste of the macaroni and cheese.

They have so many people working!  Their staff are all super friendly and cool.  They have a casual atmosphere that I love.  They give you so much food!  I can eat quite a bit and I can never finish their Mac and cheese.< /review>

<username>Timothy White<//username><userid>104616670780450565502< /userid><rating>3< /rating><review>The idea
just not that great of an idea. Limiting yourself to macaroni and cheese seems pretty silly of an idea, but then to make it mediocre seems down right stupid. Tried several styles of their main course and a number of their sides and was left wanting more. All mac and cheese styles seemed way too heavy, the sides were decent but the brussel sprouts had way too much bacon and not enough sprouts and the cauliflower was cold. Their highlights for me have always been their deserts. The parfait was delicious, the Oreo cookie was scrumptious. I would go back and probably skip everything but the dessert.</review><GmapID>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332<//GmapID>< Time>

Mac & Cheese, like 10 different kinds, all at a pretty good price point.  Get there early though.  There is almost always a line.</review>

I'm ready for anything after I go here. It takes me about an hour to complete the ritual but man that's a lot of deliciousness. Not to mention their beer mugs provide max drinkability. Line is there for a reason on Friday and Saturday... Great date spot!< /Review>

< Review>
Fantastic. My brother had the Goat Mac. I had the Mexican Mac. They were both awesome. Washed down with a great local beer, and finished with a home made oreo (style) cookie. I didn't try the home made root beer. The place is bright and cheerful. Everyone from babies to hipsters are welcome here. You might want to make a reservation - they can fill up fast!< /Review>

Believe the hype, Homeroom is the real deal. I've been going here since they opened a little under 10 years ago, and I've had the pleasure of getting to watch them grow and thrive ever since. The staff are so, so sweet and every time I go I'm torn between old favorites (mmmm jalapeño popper) or one of their creative seasonal specials. When it's crowded and service gets slow they often give you a little something to make up for the wait. All of this is enough to make me a Homeroom superfan. Much love.</text>

<Text>Want some BOMB Mac n Cheese? This is the place to go.

It's not the largest restaurant, but the food was amazing. They also have a little bar inside, where I got a beer. Not sure if they a full bar, but you can order some beers.

Highly recommend dropping by.<//Text>< pics>

BEST MAC AND CHEESE you can get anywhere! The macaroni is thick and the toppings add a nice touch to it. The prices are a bit high but only because they hook you up! Most of the time I come here, I have enough left over to take home and enjoy on another day.

I've had the Gilroy garlic and the buffalo chicken and both were soooo good!!< /Text>

<text>I love the variety of mac & cheese here! On my first visit, I ordered the classic with bread crumbs and added broccoli which is my go to. The creaminess was well balanced and the amount of broccoli was well placed all over. The amount of mac & cheese you get in a plate is very fulfilling that it's reasonable for the price. I have a reasonable appetite so I can only finish half of a plate and save the rest for my lunch the next day. If you have a hefty appetite, you can probably finish the whole plate. The service can be a little slow at times, but the staff are really friendly. One disappointing thing is that their sides should expand a little. It would be great to have some corn bread next to my mac & cheese but they only serve a bread roll and some other items that didn't seem appealing.<//text><user>101927117389872472890</user><Date>1467153407821< /Date><Gmap_id>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332<//Gmap_id>< response>

Good Mac and cheese... Usually a long wait unless you go right at 5. Plus, don't go with big parties... Wait is super long. Four or less is ideal.</Review>

Delicious Mac'N Cheese! With all the hype, I was a little disappointed as it was not the "life changing Mac and cheese" I came to hear of, but I was quite pleased at the end of the day. Not as soft as I expected it, but a bit chewy. Nice and flavorful with a breadcrumb topping option. Huge portion sizes, especially considering it is Mac and Cheese - be ready to take some home.

For price, you get great bang for your buck. High quality food and a lot of it, for a not super high price. Expect to spend ~$13. Definitely add in meat or veggies, ask your server for recommendations. The food kind of needs it; even hardcore cheese lovers will have a hard time with all that fatty cheesy goodness.

Nice atmosphere and pleasant staff. I was late meeting a friend and was in a bit of a rush, but the staff were relatively understanding and courteous. Atmosphere is great, relaxed place for a conversation. Possibly a good date spot. Wish I took a picture, it was quite nice.

Not life-changing-ly brilliant, but an excellent spot for dinner with friends, family, or a casual date. Definitely unusual and will definitely be coming back. 4.5 stars if I could.<//Review><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

I can't even BEGIN to tell you how AMAZING this place is. YUM! I had the Buffalo Chicken Mac with bacon and almost died. SO GOOD!! My friend had the Hawaiian Mac and it was AMAZING! Not a fan of brussel sprouts but they got a great recipe for sure!<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Call ahead or get there early, because this place gets packed! It's worth the wait: Homeroom offers heaping portions of mac 'n cheese with a variety of combinations. Get ready to customize your choice in cheese, topping, and mix-ins.

Most tables are shared; you'll be sitting with fellow cheese fans in a loud, boisterous  room; or, outside at one of several tables. Despite the crowd, our food arrived within 10 minutes, and it was delicious. Brussels sprouts were fantastic on the side, and the bacon baked into mine was crunchy and cooked to perfection.

The wait staff brought to-go boxes unprompted when they saw we had slowed down. Great service, good price, and great choices - we'll be back!</Review><UserId.>117834273765218431100< /UserId.>< Pictures>

This mac n cheese is amazing. I've only had the "standard" offerings- without any of the add-ons- and it's been fantastic. It's one of those places where the first thing you try is SO GOOD that you don't really want to try anything else, but once you finally do, it's just as good. Looking forward to visiting many more times to explore the rest of the menu.
We went to Homeroom To-Go; parking is on the street or in two or three spots. Try to order ahead so you can just swoop in and out. Take-home options are delicious baked at home too.<//Text>

My head just about exploded when I heard about this place: a joint that just serves mac n' cheese? No way. Yes way, it turns out. There are enough delicious variations on the old classic here to keep you coming back for months. Make sure to branch out a bit - try some breadcrumbs and caramelized onions on that mac n' cheese!</Text>

Food is fantastic. Best macaroni and cheese ever, and as its one of my favorite foods, I should know. I recommend the Brussel sprouts appetizers, and the coffee is great.(served in a mason jar, it's cute)

The dessert I had was delicious. Would live to live next door and get grandly fat and always be too full to move.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Third visit solidified my decision. Adequate mac and cheese, there is better elsewhere. Customer service is disappointing. If I'm ignored for more than 20 minutes when my water cup is empty, or my bill is waiting with the card, and I'm trying to catch the eye of the 4 people laughing and gossiping behind the counter, who are then bored and surly with me? I don't go back.<//review>< Time>

<Review>Had the Jalapeno Popper Mac & Cheese w/spinach & chicken, it was delicious. I was expecting spicier, but the combo worked. We also had the Spicy cauliflower veggie appetizer, this was amazingly tasty (and spicy, more so than the popper mac).

Very nice eclectic school room decor too.

This is a classic place that suffers from over-hype. It is good but not worth a drive. I have had better mac and cheese at places that don't claim to specialize in JUST that. Drink combos are fun, but if I wanted to water down my alcohol I would expect it to be cheaper... If you are in the Oakland area and want something cheese related you should be at the Cheeseboard. You are only allowed to come here when Cheeseboard is closed.<//review>

<review>Who would have thought that a restaurant based completely around Mac n Cheese would be this good lol

I'm having the time of my life going through the menu and ordering new stuff every time I come in. I'd like to give you a suggestion on what to eat.. But so far I haven't had anything that wasn't delicious! :-D< /review>< Pictures>

Long line, but it's good food. I got the Gilroy garlic with some chicken and it was bomb. My girlfriend got the bacon bbq and to be honest it was okay. Would go again if I am in the area and craving.</text>

I've been here maybe 5 or 6 times, and the mac and cheese is consistently delicious, with the pasta cooked al dente. The breadcrumb topping is a must-have. They provide loads of other different flavors and toppings, too, and the portions are food-coma-inducing. I'm grading this Homeroom with an A++ and will definitely mac and cheese again!</Text>

So much cheesy goodness! Homeroom makes some insanely delicious mac & cheese, and all the custom toppings make it easy to order exactly what you want. My favorite is the Jalapeno Popper Mac. They have really good iced tea, too!

They get busy, so get there early, and be cool with waiting for a bit. It'll be worth the wait! The Jalapeño mac, with unlimited iced tea, and their 10% service fee + tip, came out to about $18. This place is quickly becoming one of my regular spots.</text>

I wasn't quite sure what to expect of a restaurant devoted to Mac & Cheese but I shouldn't have been suspicious.  The rotating specials are great (feta & artichoke mac & cheese!) and the homemade root beer and deserts (peanut butter pie) were excellent.

Nice but subtle school themed decor too (the tables are made from old bleachers!)<//review>

<Rating>2< /Rating><date>1459138521467< /date><text>I really like mac 'n cheese, that's something I think we can all agree on, but no one is breaking any new ground here. What you get at Homeroom is a pretty good bowl of mac 'n cheese in a great ,yet crowded/cozy setting along with a 60 minute wait on the weekends. It's just mac 'n cheese with a few really interesting toppings. For me it wasn't worth the wait, the toppings when said and done where lost in all the cheese and the wait just killed it for me. If you're really jonesing to try Homeroom, one block away is Homeroom's takeout shop, no waiting if you call in advance.< /text></record>

The vibe here is vibrant. The food isn't worth the price. While I like the idea of adult Mac and Cheese you will either leave this place pleased or dissapointing. I have come here 3 times trying new things and left dessapointed each time. The food is heavy, too large of portions and about 4x the price I expect for noodles and cheese.< /review>

It's hard to imagine that a line may defer me from considering eating one of my favorite foods - mac n cheese. Arrive early or prepared to wait. If the latter, bring a book, preferably something like Shogun or the Bible.<//review>

This place is cool - Nostalgia with the Homeroom vibe and decor and all they serve is Mac and Cheese. They focus on making one thing really awesome and they do a great job of it. There tends to be a wait for a table and they even offer curbside pick up which is cool.<//Text>

The food is good and they have a decent selection of beers. The place is also pretty big, so it's likely you'll find a table even when it's busy.< /Text>

<review>I went here with my friend after work - 5pm on a weekday.
The service was quick and friendly and the food was great.

Pros:
Mac the Goat: Mac and Cheese with Chevre: Great!
A large serving of food
Great, friendly and fast service
Great Sangria - although not that much fruit

Cons:
I heard there can be a long wait although I didn't experience it myself.< /review><date>1414020841030<//date></record></dataset><record>

Lots of mac n cheese selections and you can customize it by adding extra toppings. When I first started eating it, I really enjoyed it. The gilroy garlic is definitely my favorite but I got tired of it really fast. I ended up taking more than half of it home.< /Review>

In general, delicious Mac n cheese.  I think the consistency and quality of their food could be improved, but overall good enough that I'll be coming back. This time around, the Mac I ordered came to my table luke warm, but the staff were kind enough to heat the food up again for me.  The sauce was delicate and cheesy, but the texture of the noodles was a bit plasticky, with not much bounce back on the chew.  The one glowing point is that homeroom offers GF Mac which is delicious, and admittedly more to my liking (at least this visit). If you eat GF, praise the pasta gods, because homeroom has answered your prayers. 😊</text>

This place is a mac and cheese lover's heaven! I love that they have a special of the day/week on the menu, so if you've been here often, you can find something new/different every once in a while. I tried the pesto mac that was a special when we came, yummm! My boyfriend loved his garlic mac with peas and bacon.<//Text>

Heard about this place and the fact that it is my sons favorite type of food. Drove up one afternoon to try and were not disappointed. I might recommend getting the "To Go" right up the street and going to a park. The restaurant is a bit crowded and it is nice to not be apart of the conversations all around you when eating.</Text>

Looks  good.  Tell you about the food later. Now is later - great food. Not tom bad a await. I had Mac & White cheddar cheese with tuna. Creamy smooth an very tasty. My Wife had traditional Mac and Cheese - also very good. Other dishes at the table included Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Mac & Cheese with Cheese. Desert's included Peanut Butter with Icecream and Home made Oreo Cookies. Good prices too , entire bill for 4 came to less than 110. (Not including Tip). One block down is Homeroom Takeout, if you want to avoid the lines and a wait for seat.<//Text>

This is one of the best places I have found in the bay for Mac and Cheese. The jalapeño popper mac was great. They took to heart to do one thing well and that thing is mac and cheese.< /text>

<text>So glad we stopped by when we were in the area (kind of). The school gimmick is well done, cute, but not too much. The mac and cheese was delicious, hard for it not to be. We had Spring Mac, which was lemony but rich, and the goat cheese one, which was creamy and tangy. Yum. They have some incentive beer cocktails, and beer/wine pairings. Desserts are classic... peanut butter pie was great. Pretty crowded on a Saturday evening, but the staff was really friendly.<//text></record>

<user_name>Dorothy Santos< /user_name><Review>Whoever came up with cheese and pasta as an entree is a genius! Homeroom has a bunch of smart people who have mastered what a good mac and cheese dish ought to taste like. It's one of those places where every detail was considered. From the decor to the food, the schoolroom feel will have you wanting soda pop, all the mac and cheese you can eat, and a decadent dessert to end your meal. This place serves up great portions for a good price and everything just tastes fresh...as if someone JUST made you a home cooked meal. I recommend the mac and cheese dish with broccoli and bacon. Yum!<//Review><user_id>113201116953740958989< /user_id>< Time>

<review>Went here with big expectations because of the reviews here online. Our group ordered "smokey bacon mac","vegan mac","original mac" and the "Gilroy mac". None of these seem to really impress us. The service was slow and could care less about the people.
Also, if you are looking to try it out yourself still, I advise you to go for lunch or early dinner. No later than 4:30pm.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The wait was a bit long and then, to be frank, the food was just OK. The desert was good, but it was basically like store bought ice cream quality with some sauce and extras thrown on. Definitely good enough to stop in for a bite if there's a line, but maybe not good enough to plan a dinner around.<//Text>

Great food, small location. I wanted to take my parents here while they were visiting from it of town, but the wait time was too long. We ended up going to the Homeroom-To-Go and ate elsewhere. Make sure you arrive early or call ahead of time.

Update: went here again last night with some friends. Un-able to split the bill. It created a huge confusion and frustration for the party. Not good for groups.< /text>

An insanely popular artisanal mac n' cheese place. Wait, what? I pass this place every day on my walk home, and it's always full with more people waiting. Deservedly so, as it's also delicious, huge portions, and a fun atmosphere, but still... artisanal mac n' cheese place?</review>

I was told to go here by one of my clients, Juan (works in to go). He said he worked there and always made sure the food is amazing. So I took his advice and went there. I'm glad i did because I was blown away by the quality of the food and the pricing. The wait time wasn't bad at all, their ipa selection is good, and the food was nothing short of incredible! I found it hard to finish my full meal though, I ended taking it home and their homemade Oreo cookie. I tried to give my compliments to Juan but I ended saying Juampi (I confirmed I said the wrong name to the staff with the others I went with, I blame the IPA's lol). If you'd like to take someone on a date, have a cheat day, or just enjoy a good meal and a drink you can't go wrong with homeroom. Also I think our servers name was Kevin, he was a good guy too! Thanks again Juan!  I've been recommending this place to everyone who asks "what's good to eat in Oakland?"<//review>

The primary focus is macaroni and cheese, which is perfectly executed in a variety of ways and even available gluten-free. Everything is fresh and homemade, down to the salad dressings.

I tried the staff pick, which was a baked potato mac with the (optional) green chiles - very tasty, well balanced, and filling.

Service is attentive, the decor is cute / kitschy (tables made of former bleachers), and the neighborhood is 'up and coming' but I did not feel unsafe.

We did not try the desserts (too full!), and while they have blue bottle coffee, the only iced tea is icky tropical fruit flavored Paradise Tea.</text>

Not so with Homeroom.

The food was so unappealing that i could stomach only 1/4 of the food.

That, plus so-so service and a 10% service charge, make this a place I would never recommend to anybody.

Especially if you like good mac & cheese.</review>< Pics>

<text>I have only been once and I liked it. I love Mac & Cheese and tried the Vermont to get a general base sample, but at the same time not get the classic. It was really good, nice and creamy with al dente pasta. I added breadcrumbs but would probably ask for them on the side as it was a bit much for me. Also, they have Paradise iced tea on the menu which I ordered not knowing it was a flavored tea.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Ok. Get ready to drop some cash on mac and cheese. First and foremost. If you're one person, you're good. If a family, yeah, you're dropping some cash on mac and cheese. Beyond that... the mac and cheese is delicious and varied, it's like a pizza shop with the toppings and extras you can add. The tap is good too, and the beer pairings actually make sense. Oh, and the brussels sprouts are a problem. Ensure you come hungry, and plan ahead to be taking a doggy bag home (or don't but, you will be stuffed, for sure). When the mac and cheese is the meal, you know its going to be a party. Enjoyed thoroughly.</Text>

<Text>Mmm. Homeroom's #vegan mac 'n cheese with soyrizo, spinach, red pepper, peas and bread crumbs paired with Rasputin's Stout delivered on heat and decadence.

I dig the classroom kitsch decor and the owners are top notch women. Definitely a favorite.<//Text>< date>

Edit: used to go here all the time. Rating was 5. They took away the soyrizo. The Mac just isn't the same. It's not very good with the new meat substitute they have. I haven't been there in months. Not worth it to me anymore. Such a shame.
Amazing. I always get the biscuits, arnold palmer and the Vegan Mac n cheese with soyrizo and lots of limes. So good! The Gilroy garlic is great and the spicy cauliflower.<//review>

<text>Home Run!! If you can get past all the hipsters this really a great place. Got there around 8pm and it was packed. The mac and cheese is wearth the wait, and under $10 plate it is a good deal.

Homeroom is always one of few special local food in Oakland. Whenever friends come from other cities I always recommend or take them here to try the Macncheese. My favorite is the Mexican one with cilantro and lime. Sooooo sicking good. Always save half leftover to enjoy later.< /text>

<Text>My bf always jokes that we're going to die from eating too much mac n cheese one day, but we just cant resist! We both absolutely love homeroom and we  come here when we want to treat ourselves or feel deserving enough of a cheat day to eat their mac n cheese!
I always get one of the classics, my favorites are Jalepeno popper mac and Gilroy garlic! However, the last time I was there I decided try something new from their spring 2018 menu, so I went for the garden pesto, it was good but not great, only because it had way too may peas in it. I wonder if I can ask for no peas, I probably should have did that or asked if it's possible but I didnt know there were going to be so many lol. Anyways, I would probably just stick with my usual next time! Still love this place :)</Text><gmapID>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332</gmapID><username>Rameet S< /username><Pics>None<//Pics>< Time>

< review>
First time I went, the place was absolutely 5stars, in everything. This more recent visit in may 2018 (one year later) it was 5 stars for service, the waitress gave honest and helpful suggestions, 5 stars for drinks, but only 3.5 or 4 for the food, because while the flavor and spice was excellent my pasta was too al dente for my tastes. My friend tried mine too and agreed - not quite done! The pasta in her dish, on the other hand, was spot on. So I was a little disappointed, to be honest.
I definitely recommend getting the bread crumbs on top, and peas. And arrive early if you dont want a long wait!<//review>

Their menu these days has a huge variety of options beyond the basic.

My most recent selection was the Sriracha version with peas and bacon added, very tasty, would have been even better with one of their beers. They even have a pizza Mac now, apparently pretty good too.

I don't think I've ever eaten dessert there as I'm always too full, but it looks like there are some good options. You can also go to their to-go location a block away and avoid the wait. .

In the vicinity a bunch of new and interesting stores have sprung up - a record store, bike store, guitar store and coffee shop. Definitely hipster friendly!</review>< Pictures>

<Time>1507591084383< /Time><text>I never kind paying a little more money for this mac & cheese than I normally would. It's definitely not an Oakland secret anymore, so going anytime on a weekend or around typical "dinner" hours on a weeknight might find you waiting a little bit. But if the weather is good, it's totally worth it. I love going to lunch to grab a mini mac and salad combo (the citrus vinaigrette is to die for!!), but I am happy no matter what time I dine. I oscillate between the Vermont White Cheddar and the Gilroy Garlic, but you can't really go wrong with any of the macs. For dessert, you have to do the oreo cookie at least once! Bonus points for the times I bring my dog and dine outside: they always bring a bowl of water and give her a few biscuits!< /text>< pictures>

Not so much on the Mac & cheese hype, AT ALL, so IMO just eh. The portion is way huge, I'm sure it could feed four people, I had leftovers for three days, and simply it wasn't that amazing. That was the last and only time I went.</Text>

Homeroom is a very cute mac and cheese restaurant decorated like a classroom. There's a library card catalog, a chalkboard wall, and paper airplanes hanging from the ceiling. They have a wide variety of mac 'n cheese with different kinds of cheese and toppings and none I've ever tried have been a miss. There's often a wait, but not for too long and you can get takeout if you want to skip the line.< /text>

Always a little bit of a wait, but it's worth it. Get some veggies as an appetizer and you can easily split one bowl for two people</Text>

<Text>Went here because I owed my wife a birthday dinner and she loooves Mac n cheese. So after some extensive researching, Homeroom came up as the best mac n cheese on the east bay and I was not let down.
It was quite a long wait to get in but not too bad. We got seated and helped quickly and not too soon after we got our food. I got the one with crab in it and it was really good, although I was kind of wishing it'd be chunks of crab instead of shreds. She got the jalapeño Mac and it was really good, even I enjoyed it and I'm not really a jalapeño fan.

It even made a good leftover meal the next day.< /Text>< UserId.>

<Text>Waited for over half an hour out in the cold while they let smaller parties in (we were 5). They told us it would be 20 minutes more, so we ordered our food to go. As we signed the receipt, they called us for a table, so we told them we would eat it here. They said we couldn't do that because we made the choice to take it to go. In addition, you sign yourself in, and the service seems pretty disorganized.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

They do mac and cheese well for sure.  Hipster vibes abound and there is a certain pretension to the staff here if you don't look the part.  I'd say skip it and get a salad somewhere else, you body will thank you.< /text>

< review>
Let me start be saying I'm not a mac & cheese person.  I gave Homeroom a shot because it has such high reviews, so I thought maybe I would be a convert - I'm not.

I had the classic and the smoky bacon.  It was OK.  I didn't find it to be anything above and beyond what I've had at other places.  I wasn't impressed.

Maybe I'm just not a mac & cheese person.<//review>

I had one with bacon and mushrooms and finished it off with a homemade oreo cookie dessert that was absolutely fantastic. Go hungry but split one with a friend becuase its a lot of food and heavy. But a great vibe and easy to park around there.... cause it's kinda in the hood. But don't be scared off because it's delicious!!</review><name>Kelsey Lowitz<//name>< Rate>

Overall my experience here has been generally poor. Lines going out the door meant we were seated in around half an hour. Once we ordered service was decent, but nothing special. Food for me was not good. My mac and cheese tasted decent, but no better than an Annie's mac and cheese box. Also I ordered a brownie for dessert. The Brownie had way too much baking soda in it. It tasted more salty than sweet and had me coughing. Besides the restaurant being nothing to write home about, my home is near Homeroom. It has definitely made the neighborhood a bit more annoying to live in. Remember those lines out the door. Imagine trying to walk through those huge crowds, especially if you have to catch a BART or something. People cross the street illegally and trample plants just to get to Homeroon. In short, I reccomend not coming here alot, as food is only decent but costs way too much, and it makes the neighborhood worse. Thank you for your time.<//Text>

Awesome mac and cheese. My favorites are the trailer mac and the vermont white cheddar. The use to have  a great breakfast mac and cheese with a fried egg and bacon, but that can be recreated ordering the classic with bacon and egg as add-ons. I also really like their ranch dip that they serve with the broccoli.</Text>

Gotta love a place dedicated to Mac'n'Chz but unfortunately execution is primarily a bowl of noodles and cream. It came out too quick. It could have benefited from a bit of baking.
Definitely a conveyer belt of mac'n'cheese. Happy they have gluten free options, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return.
They have creative selections and interesting ingredients.< /review>

I really struggled with Homeroom when I was deciding how to review them.  The fact that I, the lover of everything Mac 'n cheese, did not instantly fall in love with this place upon my first bite was my initial concern.  All of my friends were raving about how I of all people *needed* to try Homeroom.

Unfortunately, the food was just mediocre.  After spending 4 years in St. Louis, my standard for noodles comes from Noodles & Co.  If you are not a chain restaurant, I expect you to provide better food than Noodles could.  Homeroom just didn't do that.  I got the truffle mac n cheese and the garlic one and both were surprisingly bland even though those flavors should have been knock outs.  Also, the pasta shells were undercooked.

All in all, it was a very disappointing experience.  I only come to Oakland a couple of times a year, so I doubt that I will return.< /Text>

Great mac and cheese with a variety of add ins and add ons.  (Gilroy is the best. Add scallions and bread crumbs) The restaurant always has a wait. Do yourself a favor and order takeout. Don't forget dessert. Homemade Oreos, brownies, banana pudding the best peanut butter pie i ever had.< /Review>

<Text>As a recent transplant to the Bay, I made it my imperative to try the places people seem to rave about. Homeroom is good, albeit variable.

One day I went and decided upon the Gilroy Garlic. It was described as having the perfect amount of garlic, which at most places is far too little. I got it and it ended up being super garlicky and delicious. Thumbs up. The next time I got the Gilroy Garlic, I seriously couldn't taste the garlic. That sort of variation is okay if the dish isn't premised on being garlicky. I've also noticed variation in how much of the additives you get. If I'm gonna pay 2 dollars for caramelized onions, I feel like it should have more than one strand every few bites.

At the end of the day, I'll go again, but this local hotspot is good, not great. All they need is a little more focus in the kitchen and this place will be an even bigger hit.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

You don't have to tell me twice - a place with actual "good" Mac & Cheese, as opposed to the kind you got in the cafeteria as a kid?  Sign me up!

My compatriot really wanted to take me there, but wanted me to temper my expectations (she was terrified I'd be let down).  As it turns out, she had nothing to worry about.

Down to the food:
Vermont White Cheddar (with breadcrumbs): Awesome.
Gilroy Garlic Mac (with peppers and breadcrumbs): Heavenly
Homemade root beer: quite good - I loved the raw sarsaparilla taste, and the fact that it was light and not overly sugary.

Ended up eating 1.25 dishes (couldn't let my compatriots' food go to waste!)

No room for dessert.</Text>

Had an order of the Macximus (~$10): greek-style mac with artichoke hearts, spinach, shallots and feta.  Food was delicious, staff was alumni, and the ambiance was friendly.< /Text>

They specialize in Mac and Cheese and they have it perfected.  My favorites are the "jalapeño popper" (cream cheese, jalapeños, and breadcrumbs) and the "gilroy" (garlic).

Make sure that whatever you get you have them bake it with breadcrumbs. Also, do extra indulgence you can have them put potato chips on top and hot dogs inside! Yum!</Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>I tried a sample of the gilroy mac at Oakland's Eat Real Festival. It was just a simple bowl of mac and cheese, so I was apprehensive on how good it could really be. But boy was I wrong. The flavors exploding in your mouth, the noodles were cooked perfectly. I fell in love (and I don't even really like mac and cheese!)

When I finally got a chance to hit up homeroom, I was excited! My party of 3 showed up around 5:30 and only had
to wait about 5 min before we were seated. So many options! I ended up deciding with the exchange student, while the other two in my group got the smokey bacon and crab. Oh, and breadcrumbs on all of them!

We started off with the Brussels sprout appetizer. Delish!! These morsels are crispy and oh, so tasty. They were actually a favorite of the night!

When we finally got our orders, we dug in. The portions are quite large (I mean, you can only eat so much before you'll explode). I loved the flavors of mine. That ginger butter!! So subtle, but then bursts in your mouth with the sriacha kick. I tried a bite of my friend's crab mac and it was packed with crab!

While the flavors were yummy, the gripe I have was that the noodles were under cooked. They still had that "raw" taste and were a bit crunchy. It was to the point where it was just raw noodles, but after awhile it left a blahh consistency and taste in your mouth.

We ended our meal with the grasshopper pie which was delicious! I only had a bite, but it's surprisingly light!

By the time we left, there was a huge waiting list out the door. So I suggest trying to come early or an off time.

I'm willing to try it out again eventually and hopefully have a better bowl of mac! It could have just been an off night.<//text>< pictures>

The mac was two stars.
The environment was extremely crowded, felt like I was eating in a closet.
How do you run a place like this in Oakland, and have absolutely no colored waiters???
Hmmm ... Makes me wonder ..< /text>

Casual nice place in Oakland serving mainly macaroni and cheese. They have many varieties. The spicy mac & sriracha macs are good & spicy. The garlic mac is also good - add breadcrumbs to that. In the past, have had Vermont White Cheddar & the 4 cheese mac which were very good - not an overwhelming cheese flavor but cheesy, Gilroy Mac which was also good with the garlic was not too strong, & Jalapeno Popper Mac which was off the menu, but very good, not truly spicy but has a slight tinge that is just right. The Ivy leaguer, Spring Mac & Popper Mac were also very good. We also had their side of minty peas which was nice. Spicy cauliflower was ok - I would not get that again. The macs are quite filling, so one is good for 2 people. The grilled cheese with jalapeno jam was good, but sweet so you may or may not like it. The peanut butter pie is unique & good. We also liked their brownies & grasshopper pie. They have their homemade drinks like limeade, key lime pie, & rootbeer. The service is good. Lunch is a good time to go, but in the evening, the space gets tight, it is lively & louder. Parking is on the street.<//Text>

This isn't your every day Mac and Cheese from a box, Homeroom serves up the old school children's classic with a gourmet twist and it's worth a visit (multiple visits even!)

I don't usually ever think of mac and cheese as an entree in restaurants. Most often it's just a side and maybe if you added some sort of fancy meat, then you could call it an entree. But at homeroom, mac and cheese is the star and about the only think you can get here besides dessert and drinks. I came here with my sister on a Saturday evening and it was packed. We came a little bit earlier than the dinner rush so we didn't have to wait too long for a table. We decided to get the Gilroy Garlic with broccoli, caramelized onions, and the bread crumbs and the Mexican mac and cheese with bread crumbs on top as well. I also ordered an arnold palmer and banana cream pie for dessert.

The Gilroy Garlic was simply delicious. I thought the mexican mac and cheese was good. The hint of chipotle in there and the chorizo really made it unique but it had nothing on the gilroy garlic. I am a huge fan of garlic so this mac and cheese just won my heart. The garlic was strong but really went well with cheese. It was just delicious, cheesy, creamy, and rich. I also really liked the caramelized onions in it as well because it added a hint of savory sweetness. I REALLY like their macaroni, it's firm but chewy. They're also pretty big which I like over tiny small macaroni. One order is enough for one person and maybe even two if you're not really big eaters. My sister and I had a lot left over. I loved the breadcrumbs on top of both mac and cheese, added a nice crunch. I was glad that I ordered the arnold palmer because the sourness of the drink really cut the richness of the mac and cheese which helped me eat more otherwise the richness of the cheese was really too much. The banana cream pie came in a cute jar topped with caramel. I loved the banana chunks but it was a little too sweet overall for my liking.

The servers here were really friendly and I really liked the vibe of the restaurant. It was really open and modern. It's an awesome place to eat and drink with friends. Their drink menu wasn't large but it was interesting, they had some fun boozy creations. If you're ever craving mac and cheese then treat yourself out to something better than that kraft's box and check out Homeroom.< /text>

<Time>1422322981683<//Time><Text>For my 100th review, I couldn't think of a better place to review. Homeroom specializes in my absolute favorite thing to eat and it truly earns a 5 star rating in my book.

I've been here twice now and it has yet to disappoint me. The wait can be long at times, but just grab a drink at the bar while you wait. Sitting at the bar allows you to be out of the cold and to catch glimpses of the cooks make delicious mac and cheese in the kitchen.

My favorite thus far is the Gilroy Mac w/ bacon and buttery breadcrumbs. Delicious is not even a good enough word to describe it. The portions are huge and it's enough for 2 meals. Most of the time I can't stop myself from eating most of it and later regret my decisions when the food coma hits.

I've also had the Dungeness Crab Mac and Ivy Leaguer: Truffle Mac and didn't really enjoy them as much as I enjoyed the Gilroy Mac. I don't suggest getting the Ivy Leaguer just because the thyme is really overpowering and you can barely taste the truffle. The dungeness crab mac is good, but a little too pricey for the amount of crab they add.

My love for mac and cheese is embodied in this restaurant and I'll be back to try the rest of the mac and cheeses offered. I only wish they opened a location in LA or even SF.< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating><gmapID>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332< /gmapID>< pics>

<review>It's the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had.

It's the most expensive Mac and Cheese I've ever had. $28 after tip for 2 servings, no drinks, to go.

Did I really just spend almost $30 on 2 orders of mac and cheese? I must have rocks in my head.<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80857dfc830c9779:0x86db31d9371af332<//GmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) There are various mac and cheese. Because the amount is large, there is also the possibility of passing along the way.
It's quite crowded, so if it's bad timing you may wait a long time.

色々なマックアンドチーズがある。量が多いので、途中であきる可能性もあり。

(Translated by Google) Very nice restaurant with only Mac & Cheese. They have a wide variety of Mac & Cheese choices. The portions are quite large and most visitors take part of it home.

Restaurants always find reviews like this one hard to remedy because nothing specific was pointed out. We're sorry to hear that we don't measure up to your high standards. We will appreciate if you can give us information that can help us improve our products and services. Feel free to send a note to community@homeroom510.com so we can make things right.\nWe're all ears,\nNadja"}< /resp>

Restaurants always find reviews like this one hard to remedy because nothing specific was pointed out. We're sorry to hear that we don't measure up to your high standards. We will appreciate if you can give us information that can help us improve our products and services. Feel free to send a note to community@homeroom510.com so we can make things right.\nWe're all ears,\nNadja"}< /Response></record></dataset><record>
