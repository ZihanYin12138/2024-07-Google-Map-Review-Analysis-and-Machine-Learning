I have to say Jane, the one did my nails, she was amazing. She educated me while giving me the new set of the dip powder, according to my need. Until now, about 2 weeks out, my nails are still beautiful. I will definitely come to see her again when i need my nails done.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Would highly recommend. Very nice and clean salon. They have very good customer service. The massage chairs work good and aren’t broken like most other salons. Reasonable prices they even gave me $5 off for my 7 year old daughters pedicure. Would highly recommend. I usually go to salon around the corner and they would cut me and make my skin raw this place is gentle and careful and do a really good job.< /Text>< Pictures>

I normally google to find a good yelping place to go. I saw this place not too far from my house so i went. It has been awhile ago after my service. I did not want to review because i dont want to give any bad reviews. But the manager of this salon gave me concerns. He looks very mean sometimes. He also gave out some inappropriate behaviors and dirty talks to female customers, especially toward young female customers. I am not a fan of those kind of people whom run businesses . His jokes are fun but mostly not professional. It seemed to draw more drug user clients in the salon since the new people running it. It looks clean comparing to before, but the manager looked suspicious to me. I also witnessed that he made an old worker worked non stop, picked on her, and finally fired her. Please do not support this kind of business.</text>

<Review>New owner and new name. I was a bit hesitant at first but now I'm going to be a regular customer here. Shop manager is a very nice man who goes by the name of Tee.
He is so awesome that after one talk on the phone, at first I hung up. But after giving it a little thought, I called him back and made an appointment for the next day. So glad I did!< /Review><userid>114820528870524381239<//userid><gmap_id>0x809ad6e32dcc4285:0x680d2c4b9ef1397< /gmap_id>< response>

<Rate>2< /Rate><text>I used to come here for my services before. After years of not getting nails done here, i came back to try out and I liked this place at first. The lady did my eyebrows and my nails was awesome! I went to a lot of nails salons but never happy. I was about to give up. Finally I thought i found my lady, and i thought she was one of the owners, or the owner's wife. But apparently, she wasnt. She is now no longer there. I came in to get my nails done the other day, but i looked at my nails now and wished i should have taken it off. By the way, i felt the salon is kind of empty since  she left. I dont get my nails done very often, but i liked the way she did it, so i wanted to have it done again. Oh well!! I dont trust anyone with my eyebrows beside her. If anyone knows where she is at, please post it here so others will know. She sat next to the guy with the tattoo, the real owner. I forgot to ask for her name. Now i will have to be on the search for another salon with the nails. 2 stars for keeping it clean.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
i go there every 2 weeks for a fill and it’s the best. I don’t go anywhere else. I love getting them done by a guy named Qui. Whenever you chose a color from the selection of gels, it might come be a little lighter. Everytime i see something i want changed I tell him and he fixes it. The wait is very long sometimes because it get busy.<//Review>

Lavish Nails took over Kimberly Nails and they do not have good customer service. The man stood in the middle of the shop and barked orders and was rude to the employees.  Go to Kimberly new shop 1620 West El Camino Ave #146< /review>

This is the most terrible nail salon I have been to. Guy that did my nails ruined my natural nails. I have gouges in my natural nail from over filing to the point where there is almost a hole in my natural nail. DO NOT GO HERE!</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>We had booked Michael for our SD destination wedding, but ultimately COVID interfered with our plans. We rescheduled and then ultimately had to cancel our full wedding day. We were so upset, but still decided to come out to SD and shoot our elopement.  This was the best decision we made!!! The film Michael captured is so beautiful and perfectly captured everything we wanted. We were so bummed to not share our vows and ceremony with all of our friends and family, but our video solved all of that. I would also like to add how flexible and understanding Michael was throughout the whole process. He made everything so very easy and I would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a videographer.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

My husband and I rescheduled/ postponed 3 times and Michael was always understanding, empathetic and flexible to our new plans. He was always responsive and a true industry professional. 3 dates and 3 venues later, we got married and we could not have asked for a better videography team to have along side our long awaited special day. Words can't not express my gratitude to Focused Bliss Productions for making our wedding day shine even more and giving us the most beautiful keepsake to look back on this very day. 5 STARS and more! Thank you!< /Text>< Pictures>

Watching our wedding video for the first time brought tears to my eyes.  It was beautifully done, from the audio of the ceremony to the music selection, it was perfect.  We are so happy with the result.  Budget wise, it was pretty inline with average quotes we received.  Michael was very responsive and easy to work with throughout the process.<//Review>

Michael was fantastic to work with. Very responsive and exceptionally knowledgeable about the exact result I wanted. He's serious about creating a quality product. He even personally negotiated with our officiant on the day of the service to get her to wear a microphone, which she originally refused to do. Great experience with him and great video.<//Text>

Michael was our videographer for our wedding this summer in Cape Cod. He did a phenomenal job and provided exceptional service. He did a great job of planning the day with us beforehand and clearly going through the schedule and our expectations.

The day of the wedding, Michael was on time and extremely detail oriented, capturing all the right shots. The video we received was everything we hoped for. After our great experience, we would recommend Michael to anyone looking for a quality wedding video.<//Text>

<Text>Do yourselves a favor and make sure Michael and his Focused Bliss crew are a part of your wedding day Team! You won't regret it. Some people might try to convince you otherwise and say "video is unnecessary, that's what photos are for!" but, tell you what, those people haven't experienced the right videographer team yet!

Not until we experienced Michael's work did we realize that we couldn't imagine going without a video capture of our big day. Pictures are important but capture something entirely different. Without video how else will you experience the sounds of the day, reactions to key moments, emotion in people's voices, flow of how you moved together, just to name a few!

Michael and his team don't only capture the event, but he takes the time to get to know the couple and what is important to them, and he captures the special moments that you as a couple will want to relive and cherish with all their authentic texture and beauty. Having had so much fun rewatching the final product over and over again since we can't get enough of it, his capturing of our day has made us laugh, cry, and the whole spectrum of emotion in between! As soon as we saw it we immediately couldn't wait to share it with anybody and everybody.

What we also appreciated is Michael's willingness and incorporation of our feedback with a round of edits - it made us feel listened to and very satisfied with the final product.

There is no question that Michael is an incredibly talented Artist. What he does to capture the colors, clarity of sound, and use of the drone for a bird's eye view in addition to close-ups - it's unbeatable! Michael's skill and eye for this work is unmatchable and we feel such gratitude for him and his hard work, and are thrilled for all couples and their families & special people who get the pleasure to work with him and to enjoy and cherish the masterpiece he captures and creates for the rest of their lives too.

Thank you so much Michael and the Focused Bliss Team. We wouldn't get to soak up what was important about our wedding if it wasn't for your huge contribution in capturing it all, every detail big and small.

Thank you from the bottom, top, and all corners of our hearts.

I had them transfer some old films to DVD a couple of years ago and had great service and a great DVD. And now that I"m getting married I brought photos to have them make the slideshow and a few other small projects for gifts and they were so fast and accurate! They always seem to do great work, listen to my requests and deliver good product in a timely fashion.</review>

Michael did an amazing job on our wedding video and we couldn’t be happier! He did such a beautiful job for both mine and my sisters weddings. He made both of our videos so special, unique and personal that rewatching it bring you right back to our special day! He helped turn a difficult and stressful time this summer (with all the COVID restrictions and changes) into a wonderful wedding success story for me, my husband and our whole family. Before the wedding we met with Michael to plan out exactly what we wanted and expected for the day and he was so helpful and even gave us some amazing ideas we hadn’t even though of! He helped us plan out a schedule which helped make such a big day a lot more relaxing and less stressful. We are so happy we have our videos to look relive our wedding day for the years to come . Thank you Michael for helping to make it such special events for us all.< /Text>

We cannot put into words how much we love The Focused Bliss team! Michael and his amazing team made sure every special detail and moment was captured on our wedding day (aka the best day ever!).

After a phone call discussing our specifics and event day timing, we received our perfect timeline well in advance of our special day (SO appreciated!). On the day of our wedding, we were so impressed with how seamlessly they were able to roll with the punches and were so flexible with our motley crew if parts of our timeline needed to be adjusted. The team’s attention to detail and love of their craft made it so much fun for us, our wedding party and our family. We are so absolutely over the moon with how amazing the addition of Focused Bliss was to our best day ever! We can’t wait to relive our special day over and over again when watching our Focused Bliss masterpiece!</text>

<Review>Michael and his team filmed our wedding at the Birch Aquarium and we couldn't be happier! Our wedding video was artfully produced and captured so my beauty and wonderful moments from the day. Michael was quick and responsive to our questions and provided many options for recording our big day including beautiful drone footage of our reception and the venue. Our wedding had to stick to relatively tight timetables and requirements from the venue but Michael and the team handled it flawlessly and coordinated with our photographer and wedding planner without a hitch. We love the hallmark video and definely will be coming back to get some longer length videos from our big day!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I've had the pleasure of DJing many events that Focused Bliss Productions was part of. They are very easy to work with, professional, and competent. In addition the footage from those weddings they shared with me was fantastic and high quality. I highly recommend them for weddings and events.</text>

Michael and the team at Focused Bliss did an incredible job at our wedding. They were very attentive and provided quick responses to all of our questions throughout the planning process. On the day of the wedding the camera team did an excellent job. They captured amazing footage but managed to be discreet and out of the way so we could enjoy the moment. When we got the final edit we were very pleased with finished product. It truly captured the day. We highly recommend Focused Bliss for your big day.</text>

Michael and his team filmed our wedding at the Birch Aquarium in La Jolla. The weather, venue, and ceremony were amazing and Michael and his team were able to perfectly capture those precious moments for us. Our venue had a lot of requirements and a strict time schedule but Michael and his team made it work and produced an amazing video with drone footage of the cliff side venue. Michael was professional and patient with us especially since we had a lot of questions and he coordinated amazingly with our photographer and wedding planner. We love the hallmark video and are eager to see more footage from the day.</Review>

Michael and his team at Focused Bliss did an incredible job with our wedding video. My wife and I love looking back at the video he made for us so we can relive our special day over and over. Just look at the videos he has made and you can see how perfect each film is. He's a down to earth guy and makes everyone feel extremely comfortable with everything he is doing and filming. I would highly recommend him to couples looking for a videographer who will put a lot of effort into making a movie like video capturing your wedding day. Thanks Michael!

My wife and I got married in Temecula back in May of 2019, and we absolutely loved working with Michael! To start off, he was very easy to work with the day of the wedding, as he gave us clear instructions but at the same time we could barely tell he was there. Michael had to work with a different team of photographers but they coordinated everything perfectly. Lastly, our wedding video turned out absolutely amazing. We keep getting compliments on it! I would highly recommend working with Michael and Focused Bliss if you're considering doing so.<//Review>

I can’t say enough positive things about working with Michael and his team for our wedding. From the moment we first spoke with Michael over the phone, it was evident he’s a true professional with a passion for his work. Michael was so responsive throughout the planning process and I felt completely at ease the day of our wedding knowing we were in great hands with his team. While the shooters were with us the whole day, we hardly even noticed they were there capturing all the special moments of our big day.

Our wedding film far exceeded our expectations. It was so beautiful and romantic, and captured all the emotions we felt that day perfectly. It is something we will cherish forever and we can’t thank Michael and his team enough!<//review>

<Text>Michael, with Focused Bliss, was incredible to work with. As a photographer, it is incredibly important to work as a team while shooting a wedding for both photographer and video. The process with Michael was seamless. I would love to work with him every wedding if possible. Plus his energy, level of professionalism and quality of work is what sets him apart from other video teams. I highly suggest Focused Bliss Productions to all couples! It's worth the investment and something you will not regret years to come!<//Text><UserId.>104470675426176259611< /UserId.></record>

As a wedding planner, I have worked and hired many vendors for the weddings I have planned and hiring Focused Bliss Productions was one of the best vendors I have ever contracted.  Michael is professional and has made my job easier and always has a smile on his face no matter the circumstances.
He worked well with the other vendors and especially alongside the photographers which at times can be difficult.  Focused Bliss Productions provides nothing but the best and the quality of their videos are cinematic productions!  I highly recommend that you hire Michael with Focused Bliss Productions, they are simply the best!< /review>

It was a true pleasure to work with Focused Bliss Productions to capture our wedding day. They were so easy to work with as well as very professional from my first encounter. I’m not exactly a “natural” when it comes to taking pictures/video footage; however, they were able to make the day relaxing and stress free. It is truly amazing how special and intricate they can make various moments come to life. I find that most photos/videos don’t do justice of a moment, but with Focused Bliss, they did an outstanding job. I really enjoyed working with them and the product they put together for my wife and I. I would strongly recommend this company for your future moments that you wish to capture.<//review>

Michael of Focused Bliss was amazing to work with and my husband and I would highly recommend him! You can tell he's truly passionate about the work he does and pours his heart and soul into each video he creates. He's incredibly detailed and gave us a ton of options to make sure we got exactly what we wanted - including a drone! We really felt that he captured the day perfectly, and we love being able to relive the day over and over again through the video he created for us.

From the first meeting to very end, everything was seamless. We chose him because we really felt a connection, and that's so important when you have someone recording every moment of your wedding. He and his second shooter weren't "in your face" either, floating almost invisibly in the background, making sure to catch every single moment. Everything was so well planned out and organized, down to every single shot - I can't even express how happy we were with how the final product turned out!!

Again, we would highly recommend Michael - Thank you so much for everything!!!<//review>

My wife and I sifted through a lot of other videographers before we found Focused Bliss. During the introduction process they were very professional and gave us all the necessary information up front without playing any games. My wife and I were extremely pleased with how well they delivered on our actual wedding day! The video and shots they were able to get were perfect. The finished video itself is extremely special to my wife and I and we’ll cherish it forever! Very well done and thanks again.< /text>

When my husband and I watched our feature length wedding video created by Focused Bliss Productions, we both thought it was amazing and absolutely perfect!!!!  We so appreciate Michael, his team team, their hard work, the quality of the filming, and how beautifully everything was edited.  Michael and his team did a wonderful job and we loved working with them the entire time (from our initial inquiry, all of our correspondence and Michael's quick responses, to the video conference we had right before the wedding, most especially on the wedding day, and then the quick turnaround for our extended film).  We absolutely loved working with Michael and his team on the wedding day and enjoyed how friendly and easy to work with they are and how professional they are.  We were very comfortable with Michael and his team being right there with us throughout the entire day.

We will cherish this film and are so glad we hired Focused Bliss Productions to create it!<//Review>

<Review>Michael and his team were incredible cinematographers! They were so attentive from the beginning until the very end! Michael made me feel at ease when we were getting closer to the wedding day by cracking jokes and being so organized. On the day of our wedding they were kind, alert, creative, but also stayed behind the scenes and didn’t get in anyone’s way. They were so respectful and worked well with our other vendors which was awesome. Once we watched our video I couldn’t stop crying, and was so blissful and happy that they got all the best moments. They had the perfect touch of intimacy, joy, and love that they caught so candidly. My favorite part of our video were the hidden and quiet moments that they captured that we will always remember. The videos are gorgeous, amazing quality, and easy to share with our family and friends!</Review>< pics>

We work together so well and he is a team player with the other vendors, which just supports everyone overall.

The team was fun to work with and created a beautiful reminder of our wedding that we can relive for a lifetime. Highly recommend.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Name>

I was lucky enough to be recommended to Focused Bliss by our wedding planner. After watching the videos on their site (and shedding a few tears!), I knew that this was exactly how I wanted our wedding to be captured and Michael and his team did not disappoint! The whole experience was professional and thorough from start to finish, it was the perfect choice. If you want to be able to look back on your wedding day and smile for at least 5 minutes straight over and over again, then don’t look any further. Thank you Focused Bliss for giving us the opportunity to relive our wedding day forever!< /review>

Focused Bliss Productions are the absolute BEST! We had Michael, Ryan, and Anthony for our wedding videography. They created a breathtaking cinematic production for us and we could not be happier. They are all true professionals and their work is exceptional. Our wedding day was captured beautifully and they showcased every aspect of the day. We had our wedding on a yacht and the drone footage captured by Anthony is spectacular! From our first meeting with Michael we knew we could not go elsewhere, every wedding is personalized and will bring tears of joy to your eyes. Michael is very organized, detail oriented, and attentive. They do an amazing job!! I highly recommend it to everyone.<//Review>

Michael and the Focused Bliss team were such a pleasure to work with. Michael was so easy going, very thorough and more than happy to jump on a phone with us or our wedding coordinator to walk through the day and his schedule for shooting. On the big day, they arrived right on time and got right to work. Above all they made us feel very comfortable while they were filming and they were never in the way during the ceremony or reception. In fact, they blended in so well I don't think we noticed them at all!

We couldn't be happier with the final film and are truly blown away by the quality. Michael captured so many special moments that it brought tears to our eyes. It's amazing to get to relive the day over and over again. We can't wait to share this special piece with family and friends near and far. We are forever grateful!!<//Review>

Michael’s significant artistic abilities are obvious and need no review. My wife was thrilled with our video and it’s not unusual for me to come home and see it playing on repeat. What really made the difference for me was Michael’s unilateral focus on making us happy no matter what we requested. He offers a tremendous level of customer service that sets him apart from other vendors. For a day when you strive for everything to be perfect, you need to have Michael in your corner.

We were beyond happy with our choice for wedding videographer. Michael was very professional to work with leading up to the wedding and afterward. He was quick to respond to email and phone communication and was willing to do whatever it took to answer our questions and meet our needs. The team he sent the day of our wedding were awesome and so attentive, and we are so incredibly excited about how our video turned out that we wanted even more. Our wedding day was in a way that we never could have imagined. We would highly recommended Focused Bliss to others getting married!!< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Michael with Focused Bliss is AWESOME!!! Words cannot express how thankful my husband and I are that we had Focused Bliss capturing our wedding day. For the months leading up to our wedding, Michael worked with me to build the vision for my dream wedding and even spent 2 hours of his own time on the phone to help me build my timeline the month before the wedding! The fact that they capture every minute of the day and then listen to and re-watch it from start to finish to put together the best-of moments is truly a sign of their professionalism. Prior to the wedding and day-of, he was extremely professional and courteous. Michael and Ryan made my husband and I feel so relaxed on our wedding day and the sneak peeks of the video clips we saw were INCREDIBLE!! Focused Bliss has true talent and a genuine passion for their work, which truly reflects itself in the quality of their product! The team is genuine, wonderful to work with, and I couldn’t imagine having anyone else as our videographers! We already know we’re going to LOVE the final products!!!!<//review><userid>103751705775839136334<//userid><user_name>Amy Giroux< /user_name><gmapID>0x80deaacb05d1f36d:0xacd3bf2856d657ae</gmapID><Response>None< /Response><Time>1499152319208<//Time><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

My husband and I owe a HUGE thank you to Michael and the whole Focused Bliss Productions team. From the first e-mails and our meeting to figure out all of the logistics/timeline to the day of the wedding, everything was seamless! It was also a big deal that they made my husband feel so comfortable in front of the camera with how fun they made everything! If you are looking for an amazing team to document your day or other event, Focused Bliss Productions in your company!</Review>

From beginning to end, Michael and his team at Focused Bliss were very accommodating, easy to work with, responsive, and professional. And the final product is better than anything we could have ever asked for. The film Michael and his crew created made my heart so incredibly happy!  We have watched it at least a dozen times, and each time it feels more magical and special. The team we worked with on our wedding day were on time, easy to be around, and paid attention to every single little detail. They have a way of making it feel like you're reliving your wedding day all over again when you watch the film--the cinematograpy is very high quality. They captured our ceremony so thoughtfully and perfectly. The team at Focused Bliss are talented beyond measure, and we feel immensely lucky to have had them be a part of our amazing day. We highly recommend them!</Review>

Love our wedding videos!  Focused Bliss captured the day, easy to work with, great job working in tight quarters on the wedding boat, fabulous results.  Recommend using 2 videographers to capture up close and overview, so they can edit together multiple angles for you.  Check out their sneak peak short video option to share on social media.<//Review>

<text>I have researched countless videographers in the area and none are as talented as Focused Bliss Productions! They stood out because their films feel like watching a movie- they tell a story with audio clips from the day and capture some real emotion rather then just piecing clips together from the wedding day. Their team is not only professional, but also very friendly. I absolutely loved my films and I would highly recommend Focused Bliss to all engaged couples!</text><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

I love Focused Bliss Productions!!!! Michael was so professional and communicative all the way through the planning process and made booking easy peasy! He had mentioned how he would just be in the background the day of the wedding and I don’t even remember seeing him! It was so nice to get amazing footage without it being a distraction from our day. Seeing the video for the first time made me so excited to relive the moments and share with our friends and family who couldn’t be at the wedding. The artistic vision and cinematic take on our wedding day made the video truly moving and captured many of the best parts of our day! Michael’s work is undoubtedly something we will be sharing with our family for years to come. Thank you, Michael!!< /Text>

If you’re looking for an incredible videographer for your wedding, you honestly don’t need to look any further! Michael and his team were hands down the best! Not only were they incredibly professional, they captured all the details I didn’t even have time to notice and they flowed with the schedule perfectly. It was the perfect video to share with friends and family who were unable to make our big day, and I was over the moon excited to share such a beautiful video with them. I don’t regret for a second budgeting video into my expenses because I have something that will last a life-time. The day goes by so fast there are moments that you’ll miss. Having a video allows me to be able to re-live those memories over and over again. Thank you Michael and his team to capturing our day so perfectly, I am so grateful!!!< /review>

Michael is an amazing cinematographer, and a fantastic videographer for your wedding day and more. He has a great eye to make things look their best, and a nice touch with direction for those who aren't born actors. He will help to make the day an good experience, and create a video that will take you back to those amazing moments.< /Review>

We knew these guys were the right fit after I almost teared up at one of their portfolio videos. We were very pleased with the quality of the video and the effort put into them, so much so, we elected to go with the longer version 2 years later. These guys are great, and I highly recommend them.<//Review>

<review>Michael and his assistant earn 10 stars out of 10.

We hand-picked all our vendors and planned our wedding very carefully ourselves, as we both appreciate the highest excellence, as well as good vibes.

Michael possesses a unique array of traits that we’d say are only found in one to three percent of the population, in any industry.  Not only is he extremely proficient in the science and art of videography, but he is also communicative, personable, and professional.

Michael’s highlights video of our wedding is a masterpiece.  The video flows very smoothly.  He picked music that is very thoughtful of our personal style; it’s perfect for “who we are”!

In short, his video exceeded what we expected.  It’s obvious to us that Michael spent much time and effort to craft an expressive video, which combines the visual lushness of our setting, speeches, our vows, audience reactions… the list goes on.

We can't thank him enough for helping us relive our special day through his creation!<//review>< Pics>

<Review>I've had the pleasure of working with Michael and his team on several occasions, and they're my top recommended company when it comes to videography.  I've seen my fair share of video companies in my 10 years as a photographer, and the feeling of being able to trust them to do top quality and feel assurance in doing so is essential.  I'm very thankful to have them as a resource I can stand behind.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80deaacb05d1f36d:0xacd3bf2856d657ae< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Michael is an amazing cinematographer and our wedding video came out perfectly! We came across them because they were highly recommended by our photographer and glad we booked them. Michael was easy to talk to, day or night.

Pro tip: get the drone service.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><review>Deciding on wedding vendors can be an overwhelming process, but when it came to choosing a videographer,  Focused Bliss Productions made our decision very easy! We connected with Michael and he made us feel comfortable right off the bat. From the initial phone call, he was upbeat, showed excitement for our special day and was truly interested in us as a couple. He made us feel confident that he would capture all the right moments. He made a point in finding out things we we thought were important as a couple and took that into consideration while capturing our day. After viewing examples of his work, I knew that his creativity and attention to detail was exactly what I was looking for. On our wedding day, Michael and his team came very prepared, were true professionals, accommodating and appropriate as well as being noticeably respectful to all. When my husband and I received our cinematic video, we were very pleased. The video had us wrapped up in the day all over again. We knew how much work Michael had put into creating a piece that represented our entire day and we can’t thank him enough! After one year married, we are looking forward to receiving our additional documentary pieces that we recently purchased to add to our wedding day memories. Michaels cinematic and documentary style videos allows you to have the best of both worlds which was very desirable and unique compared to other videographers. In my opinion, I believe having a videographer on your wedding day is very important and I would highly recommend Focused Bliss for any couple looking for a wedding videographer!< /review>< user_id>

Michael and Ryan were wonderful to have video our wedding. They were extremely professional and did a lot of up-front planning to make the day go seamless. For a person that loves a good plan Michael took his time to outline all the various options that were available to us which provided great flexibility in the selection process. Also, when it came time to the wedding day, he pre-outlined the “play by play” so we could see the “wedding day game plan” which helped us stick to the timeline as planned. To any couples looking for a videographer, look no further as Michael and his team are beyond exceptional. For someone that struggled the most finding a videographer Michael made it very easy to select him!</review>

Michael and Paul are such awesome people and their work is fantastic! When we first received our highlights film, we watched it over and over and over. It was beautiful, happy, and brought back all the warm happy fuzzies of our special day. I wanted a high quality film that captured our moments, had great, steady shots, and clear audio - and the Focused Bliss Productions Team did exactly that. Thank you again!< /Text>

<Text>Originally, my husband and I did not plan on having a wedding videographer because we didn’t see the value of it at first. But after speaking with several friends and family, and watching lots of wedding videos on YouTube, we decided that we couldn’t pass up having a keepsake of our wedding day that we could watch and re-live.

Focused Bliss Productions was recommended to us by our wedding photographer, CJ Thomas, because CJ and Michael had worked together numerous times in the past. After narrowing it down to a few videographers, we were sold on how Focused Bliss created a story of the wedding day and weaved in music to suit the theme of the video perfectly.

If you are questioning whether you want a wedding video, do not hesitate. It is worth the investment of going with Michael and his team at Focused Bliss Productions. I loved how our video turned out. I told Michael at our 1st meeting that I wanted to see my husband’s reaction when he saw me walking down the aisle. When I saw his school boy smile in the video, I got all giddy inside. The video captured everything I wanted to see, and I always smile every time I watch it.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

After kicking around the idea of whether or not my wife and I would hire a videographer for our wedding, we finally decided it would be worth it to have the memories of our wedding day saved. We wanted to be able to look back on the video in the future and relive all the day’s magic.

We looked at a few different wedding videographers, but Focused Bliss Productions’ work stood out among all the other companies for a couple of reasons. We felt like all of their videos that we watched flowed together perfectly, and the music being played in the background only added to the story and the emotions of the day.

Working with Michael from the start was very easy. He was very clear in explaining all the contract stuff, and he made it a point to understand our expectations and what we wanted to capture.

During the Big Day, we hardly noticed the cameras. Both my wife and I felt at ease with the team’s presence. When we needed direction, Michael was the first to step up to help guide us, and keep us on track with our timeline.

We are very happy that we hired Focused Bliss, and we would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a wedding videographer, or on the fence considering to hire a videographer!< /Text>

The one thing I found I heard over and over again was “the day just goes by so fast, be sure to live in the moment and enjoy it!”. It’s a cliché for a reason. As hard as I tried on the day of my wedding, time continued to march on and the best day of my life came and went. That’s where the talents of Focused Bliss Productions come in... When I watch our wedding video, I immediately relive the entire day in 4 minutes. It’s honestly magic. The amazing shots they captured and their gorgeous editing style all comes together in a moving and timeless video.

I have so many great things to say about Michael and the Focused Bliss team that I don't even know where to start. Being our videographer, Michael and his assistant were with us the entire day and their professionalism, organization, upbeat attitude, and overall good vibes were a fantastic addition to our wedding! My husband and I couldn’t be more grateful and highly recommend Focused Bliss for any special occasion!< /Review>< resp>

Michael and his team are amazing!!

Let me start off this review by stating that while planning our wedding, my husband and I had ruled out a videographer to save some money. We didn't think we needed it. A few months after coming to that conclusion, I watched a video Michael had done for another wedding, and I cried. I didn't even know the couple, and I cried!! I knew if he could move me to tears watching strangers, then I absolutely needed him to film our wedding!

Michael and the team at Focused Bliss could not have been more personable, professional, or organized!! My husband and I received our video today and we could not be more pleased! There were many tears, smiles, laughs, and my heart was beaming and full of joy while watching what he created for us on our special day. My husband started watching the video while in a drive thru grabbing lunch, and had to pull out of line and park before putting in his order because he was so overcome with emotion. Imagine a grown man crying in a Wendy's parking lot because he was so in love with his wedding video.

That's what Michael does; his works moves you and fills you with emotion. If you are even remotely on the fence about booking with him, take the plunge. You WILL NOT regret it! I believe I have already watched our film about 25 times so far, and several friends and family have been moved to tears watching the art he created for us!! I could not recommend him and his team enough! Thank you, again, Michael for giving us something so beautiful that we will love and cherish forever!!</Review>

<username>Erin Piazza<//username><review>I was looking for someone to do a documentary-style video of our wedding ceremony. I talked with a few different videographers, and not only did I find Focused Bliss to be a very reasonable price point comparatively, but they were the only ones willing to do what I asked for! It's very difficult to get someone who can do both videography/cinematography and documentary video, and I confused a number of people I talked to by asking for simple documentary coverage of the ceremony. I got the documentary version plus some, as Michael captured many angles and very carefully pieced the video back together to give us every moment, with perfect sound fidelity. We were an outdoor ceremony, so I was concerned with the audio, but the quality was absolutely stunning and just like being there in person. The video looked just like a movie, with true-to-life colors, textures, and everything. Each detail was captured, and a masterful job was done both in the ceremony and in the video of keeping both videographer and photographer out of the scene. Just amazing, especially given the setup of our ceremony site. I almost considered not doing a video, but it was worth every cent, this is a priceless keepsake and meant so much to us to have! Thanks Michael & the Focused Bliss team!</review></record>

< Review>
Focussed Bliss did an incredible job creating a short (6 min) and long (20 min) film of our wedding day. Michael's editing skills are unparalleled and it makes you feel like a movie star. Our day-of videographers were so good that you forgot they were there! I watch both videos all the time and they are the perfect record of our special day.

Even well after the wedding Michael was flexible in addressing our needs to make our most perfect results.<//Review>

Focused Bliss is amazing! We found our awesome videographer through our wedding planner - Kellene (Betty Blue Events). Michael is the best! Once you sit down with him for a couple minutes, you're going to think, okay I've got to hire this guy. He's very detailed and super organized which is perfect for making videos. During our first interview, he laid out the entire timeline for us which made us feel very comfortable with his knowledge of wedding videos. He's very professional and we didn't even notice him during the day of.

The final product is amazing and all our guests especially the engaged couples are amazed by how great the video turned out that they're definitely reconsidering getting videographer now. Can't believe they were going to skip video! We ordered the cinematic film which is around 14 minutes and it came out beautifully! We thought 4-5 minutes of our wedding would be too short and we were right! Michael knew what we wanted and made exactly that. The video shots were perfectly edited and timed with the music which made the video flow very cleanly. It wasn't cheesy and sappy like some other videos we've seen. We were so satisfied that we ordered more videos of our vows and speeches! Great to have that option to add-on! Can't wait to see them!

Thanks so much again Focused Bliss and Michael! You're the best!<//Text>

<review>We are so thankful to have Michael and his team shoot our special day! Both the 30 second 'sneak preview' and our 5 minute wedding video are amazing and make people cry! We weren't originally going to get a wedding videographer, but after watching the Focused Bliss Videos on their Vimeo stream, we HAD to go with them as our videographers. I was crying watching other people's wedding videos that he shot, and I didn't even know these people! We worked directly with Michael and we also bought a few hours of drone coverage. It really made the difference in the video and I would recommend it to everyone. Michael is so artistic and talented that his video not only makes people cry (including co-workers who weren't even invited), but it also inspired both of my cousins who are getting married to get a video. Everything about working with Michael has been professional, organized, and easy. My husband and I are both accountants and very type A, so during the wedding process it was difficult working with some of the 'artistic types' that we needed for our wedding, but Michael was the exception to this! Not only was he so incredibly artistic and gave us the most beautiful wedding video we could have imagined, but he was SO professional, organized, and easy to work with. He's the best of both worlds!!! Focused Bill were on-time with their video, were very professional during our wedding day, and even helped navigate some hiccups on that special day! We are very appreciative of everything Focused Bliss did for us on our wedding day and we are so glad we chose Focused Bliss for something so important.</review>< Pictures>

Dr. Ryan is very gifted at what he does! He listen's to your needs, and ensures every detail is taken care of! Dr.Ryan is kind, gentle, and has a lot of compassion and empathy for his clients and their journey. He will spend the time with you, that you need and can examine your back with great knowledge and insight as to what issues are occurring. I have been seeing him for a few months and honestly have had immense change and positive results in my back and joints since seeing him! I feel he is gifted and has energetic healing hands and highly recommend him!</Review>

Dr. Ryan and Dr. Shayna are both excellent! I've had back issues for years and it is all finally manageable thanks to the team at Back to Basics. After a back injury while moving and lifting heavy boxes I shouldn't have, they got me in right away, did X-rays to see what the issue was, then created a great treatment plan and walked me through every step of the way to make sure I felt my best. They even have an incredible laser machine that has really helped my back. I now see them every 4-6 weeks for adjustments and to make sure my alignment is on track - sitting at a desk all day working on the computer really does a number on your neck. Very grateful to find a team I can trust that really takes their time to care for me.< /review>

Best chiropractic experience I've ever had! Dr. Ryan and the entire staff were kind and  professional. Dr. Ryan helped me with my chest injury in just a few weeks. He was able to get me back to my lifestyle seamlessly and pain free and I am so grateful! I  will definitely revisit Dr. Ryan and the Back to Basics office for all my future health needs!< /review>

From start to finish, the staff was very professional.  Emma, the front manager is very professional, acknowledging you as you enter the office.  She is prompt with taking care of your appointment needs, and follows up with future appointments or referrals.  Dr. Shayna takes the time to listen and evaluate your physical issues.  She is careful to attending to each problem with precision.  I would recommend your chiropractic care to this office.</review>

Doctor Ryan is very professional, knowledgeable and a master of his craft.  He was able to identify the source of my pain after a 2 minute assessment. Laser treatment, percussion, and a rib adjustment later, the healing process was underway.  Within a day I had a dramatic increase in mobility and with a follow up appointment and neck adjustment, I was back to 100%. Highly recommend Back to Basics. Great staff, state of the art facility and excellent service.< /Text>

<Text>Dr. Ryan was incredibly personable, spent lots of time with me to learn my history and help to investigate where my back problems were coming from. After reviewing x-rays he took, he did laser treatment and a couple adjustments, and then gave me a treatment plan. I felt very comfortable and I’m great hands. Highly recommend him and his practice.</Text><Rate>5</Rate>< name>

I've been a patient at Back to Basics for over 12 years, they are the absolute BEST.  Prior to that, I had pretty severe back issues and was not having success with chiropractors.  Dr. Ryan changed all of that--he is SO thorough, has a very gentle and compassionate approach, and most importantly I've had amazing results and feel great.  He's changed my perception of chiropractic care.

I had received acupuncture treatments in the past, but Dr. Jay is a game changer.  He incorporates herbal remedies, flower essence therapy, energy work and SO much more.  His healing techniques have made a huge impact in my life physically and emotionally.

I highly recommend seeing the amazing team at Back to Basics.  From Nicole at the front desk to the doctors and amazing massage therapists, I don't know what I would do without them!</Review>

Dr Shayna is very good at what she does. She has great bed side manner and takes the time to listen before just jumping into the adjustment.
As a matter a fact the entire staff at back to basics are very companionate and willing to help. I look forward to every time I am able to get in for an adjustment<//Review>

<Text>Dr. Ryan is professional and an amazing chiropractor!  He takes time to really understand what is going on with your body, and has recommendations for additional exercises and strengthening you can do alone.  He's adjusted my entire family for years!  The office is welcoming and cozy and Nicole, at the front desk, is the best!  Finally, both my husband and I have received massages from many of the individuals on staff.  Each massage has been great and a good compliment to our adjustments.  Furthermore, with the specials they offer periodically, the massages are always a good deal!< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80dcdfe6405bc8bd:0x5654519a11153cf3</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Back to Basics is always a pleasurable experience even when your not feeling your best upon arrival. A beautiful calm setting lends to a very experienced and professional staff to help your body achieve its best results. I would recommend this for anyone looking for reactive and more importantly, proactive care for a long happy life.

P.S. If you have the time to set up a massage with Starr before your adjustment you will not be disappointed!<//text>< Pictures>

I have had lower back and sciatica issues for as long as I can remember, which can be debilitating when it really flares up. I travel a lot for work, so it is hard to find and build a good relationship with a chiropractor and to come up with a adjustment and recovery plan that works for me.

Having said that, I have been going to back to basics for the last 3 years (during the summer months) with huge improvements and longer lasting periods between flareups. Dr. Guitare has straighten me out and is continuing to help me to come up with stretches and exercises to remedy my problematic back.

I highly recommend Back To Basics and I would like to thank everyone in the staff for making every visit a great experience.< /text>

Dr. Ryan and his staff are the best!

I took my mother-in-law to see Dr. Ryan after a car accident and he examined and explained everything to her. He actually indicated that she would recover fully WITHOUT treatment!

He did suggest he could reduce the recovery time with some simple treatments. After 5 treatments, he indicated there was no need for further treatment, but provided a list of exercises that would help strengthen her back.

His integrity is beyond reproach. His goal is for you to be well - not to keep seeing him.

Back to Basics is like a second home. You feel cared for there. Everyone knows your name and greets you.  Dr. Jay has changed my life!!! Six months ago I was in so much pain from Fibromyalgia I could barely get out of bed. Now I’m back to work, exercising and my pain has gone from 6 to 2. Dr . Ryan and Dr.Shayna have also helped with my back pain and movement. They are so gentle with me which is huge and I get much relief from my adjustments. Now I just go in for monthly maintenance to keep me as pain free as possible. They are the best!!!<//Review>

<text>Dr. Ryan is amazingly skilled, humble, knowledgable, and kind.  Nicole the Office Manager is super accommodating and helpful as well. My husband and I always feel great post visit and go on a regular basis for maintenance.

Massage Therapist, Star is the best all around. I’d dare to say she has the best massage hands in Orange County.

They are to reach for scheduling and billing questions. I recommend them to everyone.

My  experience has been fantastic! When I first started going a year and a half ago my back was going out on me every three months.

I have used the Medx machine under Dr Shayna’s guidance to increase my back strength.

I participate in all my favorite sporting activities and can handle my household chores with ease.

Highly recommend Dr Shayna and all the Back To Basic staff!</text>

Back to Basics. I absolutely love and look forward to receiving treatment, seeing Nicole and Dr. Ryan. Nicole is one of the sweetest people I’ve ever met always going above and beyond when it comes to being flexible with appointment times. Nicole everytime I walk into the office goes out of her way to ask me how I’m doing, what’s new, and makes sure I’m comfortable with my stem and heat treatment. She’s amazing. Dr. Ryan.. Awesome guy. Great Doctor. I’ve seen him regularly since high school (2013) whenever I’ve felt discomfort Dr. Ryan dissects the trouble from what activities I was doing all the way to treatment and makes sure i feel 100%. Also can hold a conversation and doesn’t just turn you away so he can get to his next patient. Facilities are very clean and artsy. If you’re looking for a QUALITY chiropracticor and staff. Once you try B2B you won’t go anywhere else.</Review>

Great chiropractors who really care for their customers. I've been a patient for over 5 years and have had consistently wonderful care. Dr Ryan and Dr Tom take the time to understand your condition, discuss exercises and treatment, and work hard to improve your health. From their office manager to the doctors and their massage therapists, they're all warm, friendly and top notch.</Review>

Went here for my Tennis elbow, was so bad I was considering surgery. In 4 sessions, Dr. Shayna had me feeling 90% better! I can’t recommend Back To Basics highly enough.<//review>

I have had severe back pains for years.  But now my back is back to normal thanks to to Dr Shayna.
She got me on the MedX machine and it has worked unbelievable miracles.  I am not exaggerating
I was at the point where I thought I would be in a wheel chair. Now I’m at the point where I can sleep and wake up with no pain.
She started me off at a low weight of 76 pounds.  We  are now up to 140 with a goal of 220.
I had never thought of working lower back muscles.  But the MedX machine at  Back to  Basics is truly miraculous.<//Text>

Dr. Samuelian is very thorough and takes the Time to really figure out how to best he can help you feel better,  and takes a holistic approach to his treatment plan for you. I recommended him and his staff to several people and everyone has raved about the service, professionalism, and help they've received from Dr. Samuelian and his team.<//Review>

No problem, he said. We checked out a few storage units and I again reserved a unit but didn't want to commit because it was further than where I wanted it. Later that day, I found another storage unit closer to my home and called in to Tyler to cancel my reservation.

Again, no problem! I was really impressed with the customer service, especially by Tyler, and I will return to this U-Haul site again for my next move!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808fbfa0b09b693d:0x6e419ab2fb430281</gmapID></record>

Had towing hitch + wiring installed on my '17 Mercedes E300 Sedan a couple weeks back. Newer model Mercedes vehicles are definitely not easy to work on and I specifically did not want any wire splicing to prevent OEM warranty loss. After researching google reviews and yelp, Uhaul of Thornton seemed to have most positive ratings for hitch install, despite they are far from where I live. In the end, the longer drive was more than worth it.

Outstanding installation service - performed very cleanly and at extremely reasonable pricing. Tried the Zero Contact Module for wiring, which did not work. But was recommended a pinch type wiring (Similar to posi-tap/ No splicing) which worked perfectly. Have utilized the hitch to carry bike racks and to tow UHaul motorcycle trailers. Hitch and wiring have functioned 100% perfectly. Highly recommended for hitch installs. Overall service experience was remarkable. Will return for any and all of my future hitch install needs. Thank you Uhaul of Thornton - keep up this good work.< /review>

<review>5 stars for the great customer service that I was given. I needed a 10" truck for my move from Fremont to SF downtown. After 1 hr of borrowing the truck, my plans changed and I no longer needed the truck. So I came back to the location and returned the truck. They offered to cancel my order completely because I did not use the truck and drove less than 4 miles. Little things like this make a huge difference. Thanks guys!<//review><gmapID>0x808fbfa0b09b693d:0x6e419ab2fb430281</gmapID><user_name>Amandeep Sodhi< /user_name></record>

My first moving experience. It's so easy and hassle free renting a truck at this place. Nice people, very courteous. Asked for my needs and carefully explained everything about renting. All charges were explained, there were no hidden charges. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for moving truck rental around Fremont area.<//review>

< Review>
To start off, I wasn't informed of the option to have 24hr access to my storage unit, and they rented me a unit on the interior of one of the buildings which I thus didn't know was inaccessible after store hours. I arrived at 7:10pm with a pickup-load of stuff to find the staff closing up the store, and all the buildings were locked with no way to get into my unit. I had to haul everything back home and unload it back into my garage.

In trying to rent and deal with delivery of a U-Box later to move my stuff out of the storage unit and cross-country, I seldom was able to speak to a rep at the store; nearly every call rolled over to the national call center, whose staff couldn't really handle things that were store-specific, and my calls were only returned by store staff about 10% of the time. Generally, I always had to call and leave messages multiple times to get a call back for anything, and the cumulative result was that my cross-country move was delayed more than 10 days, and they missed getting my U-Box delivered by the end of the month, thus forcing me to pay for an extra month of rent on the storage unit.

The original quote that I received for the U-Box was somehow misplaced and not logged electronically such that the national U-Box customer service people could see it when I called to confirm my reservation a couple days before it was supposed to be available, and they told me the price would be $400 more than the original quote. Only after leaving messages for the store over the course of 4 days, and finally being escalated to the regional manager's voicemail and waiting a few more days for a call back, was I able to get them to dig up and honor the original price.

Worse, my U-Box was not forklifted into position on time, even though I'd called the day before to make sure they had plenty of notice to have things ready. I had to call the store to find out what was wrong, my call rolled over (again) to the national call center, I explained my predicament and was transferred to a regional manager, and she messaged and called the manager at the Thornton location directly to finally get someone to move the U-Box. My movers, who were being paid by the hour, waited for 25 minutes on the clock (my dime) before they could start working.

If things had gone less-than-swimmingly a few times, that's everyday life, and I would understand. As it was, I was held hostage to a pattern of inattention and failure to follow through over a period of multiple weeks that cost me a bunch of extra money, delayed my move, and was a real pain to try to resolve.

As I write this, I've been waiting all afternoon for a call back to set up shipment of my U-Box.<//Review>

Was in there yesterday and waited 20 minutes just to be turned away because I had a rushcard and they could not rent a truck to me with that card. I have rented with them in the past with that particular card and no problems but now there is. Went to a different uhaul location and they rented to me just fine with no problems.  Won't be returning back to this location for truck rentals no time soon.</Review>

<Text>U-haul in general is a scam.

We rented a truck for a day at the cost of $39.99 a day. Little do we know, they also charge for miles, gas, and a myriad of other stuff. Our final bill for a day of moving came out to roughly $200 for a day of rental and 50 miles of driving. This is without insurance.

We later on did some more moving and decided to try out Turo. We rented very similar, if not the same, truck. Our bill came out to be $25 for a day with insurance.

I'll never use U-Haul again.</Text><pics>None</pics><date>1500742561580</date><Rate>1<//Rate><Name>Richard Chen< /Name></record></dataset><record>

To everyone thinking of coming here, don't. Every major truck rental business does price matching! This place is the worst, our uhaul broke down in 90 degree weather an hour out, had to wait 4 hours for a mechanic who was nice but told us not to turn off the truck, No compensation for wasted time. Had a pizza delivered to the broken uhaul truck. 0 stars</Review>

🙌🏽 Oh my gosh, Michael 👏🏽 is👏🏽a👏🏽 saint! 🙌🏽
Earlier today he was the one who hooked up the car with a hitch while we filled out all the info with another sir. We asked that sir if we could possssssibly have one of the trailers instead of having to drive 2.5 hours Sacramento in the morning just to get a trailer and then drive back and start packing. Obvs the answer was no. 🤦🏻‍♀️ It was graduation weekend in the Bay Area and we had forgot to make a reservation early enough. 🤷🏻‍♀️
So we come back 90 minutes later and our bff Michael has finished installing the hitch EARLY.
On a long shot, I asked our new bff Michael if we could have any of the trailers, even if it wasn’t covered. 🙏🏽 He said he would check by calling in.
BRO CAME THROUGH AND GOT US THE TRAILER! This man is BLESSING US! #gouhaul #andgomichael! #whatachamp!🏆< /Text>

<Review>My card was used fraudulently at this uhaul. Someone tried to purchase a uhaul in california while i was in vegas. This company gave me the run around multiple times. They sent me to my bank. Told me my bank will handle it that i dont need a police report. One year later im renting and they are denying my rental until i pay what my bank got back.  Now they say i need a police report. So either postpone the move until i get the report back who knows after how long making waiting impossible. Never using uhaul again. I recommend nobody else does either.  They gave my info away and im getting penalized for it. I would like to give 0 stars. No help from these money grubbing pencil pushers.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808fbfa0b09b693d:0x6e419ab2fb430281</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

LOVED stumbling upon this place when visiting La Jolla! Incredible smoothies, juices, healthy and nourishing to-go meals and fresh baked goods. Kept me feeling energized and fueled my weekend in town. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a cute spot for a quick refreshment! Can't wait to get back.<//Review>

Two tables and a bar to sit at... They serve on paper plates... Food quality overall rather on the mediocre level... I heard the attendant saying over and over the same thing as customers came in regarding how much proteins they contain and "that it is so good and it's his favorite"... P.S. it's not just about proteins.< /Text>

<Review>Right now the prices are amazing because of covid.. they got this blonde employee that literally disinfected the register per person being rung up.. and when it was my turn this girl came around and helped me to find an item.

Whatever the company or manager is doing they're on track.. today was not my first time in the store and I've been helped each time with professionalism and care.

Good store to support and good people 👍👌</Review>< rate>

<text>I normally shop at express online but when am at the promenade mall sometimes I will stop by at the store. I like the quality of express clothes and most are timeless and not super trendy that it’ll go out of style fast. Not for someone looking for stand out pieces. Staff have always been nice and the store is clean and organized well.<//text>< pics>

Unbelievable!  I was walking around the store for 30 minutes, piling clothes and shoes over my arm til it hurt and the 2 ladies working here just ignored me!  Good associates typically start a room for you.  The tiny blonde even helped me, after I asked for it of course, find a skirt in my size!  So she obviously saw how many items i was holding.  I have never been treated this poorly in an Express in my life!<//text>

A little disappointed in the trend of catering to men who are skinny/slim. No items of the classic fit variety were available for purchase--instead they're only found "online". If I wanted to try one on to see how it fits, I would have to pay for extra shipping to get the sizes right. Not a cool business model.< /review>

As we walked the store. We were shopping and completely ignored. Very unprofessional. We were not window shopping and because of the lack of professionalism we will not be coming back to the Express store.<//review>< date>

Very inattentive staff. Several shoppers wandering through dressing room area with no attendants to unlock let alone help shoppers. Unclear marked prices and sales. Checking out seemed to be a burden for the clerk and don't dare ask questions about coupons or rewards program without getting a nasty annoyed look.  Very irritating and unpleasant experience.<//review>

They have really good sales but terrible cell phone reception. Can't really shop at ease without having to keep walking to the front of the store to check your phone. I try not to buy anything there unless it is on sale.</text>

The owner is amazing!! I enjoy going in there and talking with her and the kids love the pizza and playing the games there. I don’t eat bread, so I ask her to make a special pizza and she made her first and the best keto pizza I’ve had yet. I really hope she adds it to the menu.<//review>

This is my local go to pizza spot. I’ve been coming here for eighteen years because the food is great and the owner and employees go out of their way to make you feel welcome.
And, if you are just driving through town to someplace else it’s a wonderful place to grab a bite too. Oh, also, very kid friendly with the arcade and pool table.<//Text>

<Review>This is the best pizza ever!  We have been coming here since 2008!  The garlic butter sauce is my fav and regular sauce my husband's.  Never soggy!  Although I do get extra crisp crust.< /Review>< Pics>

The owner was super nice and the pizza was pretty good. There are other options if you do not want pizza. I have been looking for a new pizza since my favorite place closed for business. I think this will be my new place.</Review>

Keeps accusing me of calling in an order and then not picking it up, why would I keep coming back to a place that I like or do anything to hurt the business, they keep saying the numbers are the same and that I use different names, my name is Pablo/Paul, not that hard to listen. Then she gives out her pity story about her own personal problems. I’m not coming back anymore especially if they lack customer service, they lost a customer to an already dead location, great job on this.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1553970194232, 'text': 'Pablo, thanks for taking your time to review us! If it was the matter of accusations without proof then your review is valid. However since we have multiple records of you not picking up your pizza (the multiple tags of you calling in and placing orders under different names)  we unfortunately do have the right to refuse your service. Customer service is from both ends the vendor AND the consumer and if the consumer actions are such (in this case your negligence of as a customer of not picking up food) we act accordingly. We apologize for the mishap.'}</resp><GmapID>0x809a9df699c32b01:0x983028d7101d82fd</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Ordered a  Hawaiian pizza to be delivered. Received a ham no pineapple. The owner stated I ordered just the ham from her and I didn’t even give her the order pay $25 for a medium Ham pizza that taste horrible and a horrible thin cookie thing in a round tin pan. Store bought crust. HORRIBLE</review>

<review>I’ve dealt with Gabe Segarra and Sameday Insurance for almost 10 years now. I Have both lost and gained cars throughout that time. They’ve made my transitions flawless. Always find you the best company for your interest. I just bought a car today and I was done in 30 minutes, all over the phone and email. I recommend to all of my friends and family, they’ve all switched over. I recommend you do too!

< Review>
I originally reached out to Sameday Insurance in 2018 because I needed SR22 immediately requested by Dmv. Gabe is the person that helped me out then and has been helping me out with ALL of my car insurance needs until now 3 years later. It has been a journey and I’m grateful he’s been the one to assist with all of it. He makes everything smooth sail always finds the best coverage and best prices. Above and beyond work ethic is an understatement. Thanks Gabe!</Review>

Everyone dislikes looking for new car insurance BUT my new agent, Auggie, made my experience a Positive one.
Not only did I get the best value but it was done with great customer service and quickly, even with everything explained in detail.
Auggie emailed me all the information I needed while we were still speaking, it was so helpful.
My agent gave me the confidence to know I’m able to call with any questions and will receive good customer service 👍🏼< /Review>

Ariana was very knowledgeable of her job information... Was on top of the question that I had for her about the insurance.. I was only looking at getting insurance on one car.. but she found me the best deal for two cars... So, pulled me in and I got the insurance for both vehicles... She's the the greatest.. She's on top of her skills... Thank you Ariana..... I will send people your way to get insurance..... Great. Very professional. Perfect person to get people in... Thanks again<//Text>

I usually don't write reviews, but I just had to after such a delightful experience with Paul. He helped me through and through to get the best quote possible, no hassle! Unlike your typical insurance agent, he was very customer centric which I appreciated and he made sure not to waste any time at all to get me driving insured asap! I wish I could rate 6 stars but I'll be sure to send the word around to everyone I know!</Review>

Gabe is #1!!! Long story short, my insurance lapsed, and I was unknowingly driving around without insurance. Called Gabe and he found me a better rate and with MORE coverage than I had before my insurance lapsed! Having insurance again immediately was important to me and Gabe made sure I knew he valued me, and my family, by working with me even after regular hours just to make sure I had everything I needed. Can't say thank you enough Gabe:)<//text>

<text>My experience with Gabe segarra with same day auto insurance was impressive to say the least. He really knows his business well and will work hard for you as he did for me. His character is solid and professional. He takes his business seriously and was a joy to work with and is very responsive. He certainly exceeded my expectations very quickly. I highly recommend him and his professional service. Other auto insurance services took days even weeks to contact me and he handled my auto insurance needs not only SAMEDAY but actually in less than 1 hour!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c333fff2254209:0xa3c163e33742fcda< /Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

I'm very good insurance company by my experience a plethora of knowledge and all different kinds of areas got back to us asap and actually went far over and beyond his duty as to being an insurance agent in terms of following up getting the papers even when we forgot to call he was immediately calling us and and that I like I'd say I would recommend this insurance company to anybody anytime and thanks for being so professional and caring for people<//Review>

<review>Paul was able to get me the best deal with no haggling,. I should tell you first yes I was told I have four accidents on my record. As it turns out, I was responsible for only two of them. Call is the one that discovered that. Other agents overlooked the fact that I was responsible for only two accidents, and therefor were trying to get a policy with four accidents. That resulted in me being rejected for coverage by multiple companies.

Dealing with insurance it’s something that I can typically dread, but Paul made it quick and painless and within an hour!  I’m honestly very happy with the deal that Paul got me. I’m glad I held out until he called.

I just wasn’t feeling the other offers I received in the last few days. I had the feeling the others were trying to juice me - now o know that is true.
(Being given the runaround with car insurance is reminiscent of shopping for cars at a car dealership! Who enjoys being toyed with at car dealerships?)

I don’t normally write reviews unless the service or product is remarkable. Paul is calm, collected, not pushy, not at all like a typical salesman. He wasn’t just trying to get a sale - he seems to have a solutions-based approach. All too often do people I encounter focus on what’s in it for them. That approach stinks, frankly speaking. Paul, conversely,  is a breath of fresh air.

Thank you, Paul, for being straight forward!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>On march 29th at 2pm I started the process of purchasing my new car, at 4pm I got a hold of Gabe Segarra so i could get my insurance done. I asked gabe "what time do you think i will get my car insured and delivered?" 6pm he said, well my new car was in my driveway at 5:55pm! fully insured! They really mean it when they say Sameday. Thank you gabe, your work ethic and your word is appreciated. No need to go anywhere else.  I am more than satisfied, how about 6 stars! Yes or no?! Next up, my home insurance. Congratulations to all sameday management and staff, well done, it starts from the top!

The customer service was outstanding. I just bought my first car and I needed car insurance. I had been calling company after company all morning. I called these guys and got everything taken care of. My agent was Auggie and he definitely helped with my situation. He explained all of my options and worked to find the best rates. 5 STARS and give my mans a raise yo...He earned that sh**

<Text>I have been nursing a problem with a previous insurance for the last 5 month, going back and forth without finding a possible solution. After many phone calls, getting disconnected and placed on hold for over 30 minutes, finally, someone transferred me to the Manager of the Same day Insurance office in Montclair, CA. The office manager's first name is Gabriel, known as Gabe. After explaining my problem to him, he listened to my concern in a very professional manner and we exchange few words and he stated that the was going to  placed hands on  my case. After sending him some requested documents, in less that 24 hours my problem with the other insurance company was resolved. Now, I will be receiving a refund from the other insurance company, not bad, not bad.

Auggie is the best! I got the best quote by far and they have excellent customer service, clearly the best experience buying Auto insurance. I will no doubt be recommending them to all my friends and family.< /Text>

<review>I had gone a while ago to get insurance because I was paying like 200 for just liability. My boy Auggie hooked me up for only 70 a month!! He explained how insurance worked. I left saving money and understand what I had purchased! Ask for Auggie he will take care of you!!<//review><resp>None</resp>< Date>

<Review>If it wasn't for SpeedPro Mission Valley our high school field hockey Seniors would not have had a great senior night! We needed these personalized posters printed by noon and I had called at 8am in the morning. Jessica was very personable, patient and just helpful.  She gave us different option to upload our files so that we can choose which was the faster option.  Once they all have uploaded she confirmed the receipt and confirmed when the posters would be ready.  I was so happy with the service and product! Oh and they're the most affordable print company! I will no longer use anyone else!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80d955c1adfd7e6b:0xac17cd18e7851633<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The customer service was amazing and there pricing was great. Way cheaper than Office Depot and Staples!  With a faster turn around time. I had a client who needed a giant map of San Diego created and printed for there office.  The quality was amazing and I will definitely be using them for future projects.<//review>

SpeedPro provided excellent service when when needed window graphics. Technicians were on time, courteous and completed the job in an efficient manner at our manufacturing facility. This is the second time we've used them and I will continue to call on SpeedPro Imaging for our future needs! 5 Stars!!< /Review>

Dan at SpeedPro handled the graphics for the Westview High School Gold Instrumental Music Program semi trailer and it turned out great!  It really turns heads when we arrive at tournaments.  He is patient, professional, and responded to our needs, like having to do the installation after school hours.  We worked together to reduce the cost since the program is almost entirely funded by donations.  Thank you Dan!</review>

I had a wonderful experience with Dan and his crew at SpeedPro Imaging.
They completed the sign on my van in days from inception,  when I arrived they were happy to install it to perfection.   While I was there in minutes the job was completed.  And his designers had time to speak to me about adding some details to the van that has been a dream.
Quick, affordable and great staff from start to finish.  I would highly recommend them for any imaging projects you have!

I was referred to Dan Pickett 4 years ago by another printer that was not able to accommodate a special large laminated poster project for the firm that I work for.  Dan was extremely helpful in recommending the paper and type of lamination.  What a lifesaver he has been for our unique needs. I have used Dan on other projects and he and his team come through for me with exceptional follow-up and customer service. The pricing is great and reasonable as well. I highly recommend Speedpro!!<//text>

<review>I had been putting LASIK off for years but so happy I finally did it with Center For Sight - the process was quick and painless and everyone there was fantastic and super friendly. Liang Keith MD walks you through it in a way that helps calm your anxiety too so it's over before you know it. Couldn't recommend Center For Sight more, so glad I came here! Being able to see perfectly without glasses is a great feeling! Don’t waste your time finding another doctor , I did all my research there is to do on a doctor and he’s more than qualified hope this helps 😄< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I had astigmatism and I was really tired of wearing glasses/contacts so I made the decision to get LASIK. I searched around and called a few places but I chose this place because they were very professional and were able to schedule me very quickly. The doctor went through all the concerns with me and the procedure itself wasn't fun but its worth it for the vision I have now. I was having some glares for about 2 months after and then my vision completely healed and stabilized. I see great at night and during the day. Also for surgery you will need to spend about $200 (costco) on eye drops and prescription that you need after so make sure to budget that in. The payment plan they offered is really generous and you can use them at other places if you need other kinds of surgery.

Thank you Dr. Liang and your kind staff for taking good care of my eyes!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Not only did Dr. Liang do an outstanding job of restoring and improving my eyesight, but both he and his staff make you feel totally comfortable during all phases of the procedure. Very personable, understanding and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend Center for Sight in Sacramento.</review>

I was referred to Dr. Liang because my cataracts were greatly limiting my everyday life - keeping me from driving at night or on trips to unfamiliar places. At age 69, I wanted to have optimum sight now, while I could still be physically active.

Dr. Liang's office staff were all exceptionally kind and skilled at what they do.The intake process taught me so many things about the state of my vision and what could be done to improve it.

I had the first eye surgery one week ago. The procedure was quick and not painful. I had one day of slight discomfort and within two more days, I was driving my car without wearing glasses! The impact of that improved vision is amazing! I now feel at ease and confident in my driving, and also feel much more solid on the ground when walking or hiking.

I just scheduled surgery for the second eye and can't wait. It's likely both eyes will return to 2020 distance vision.

There are several options for improving your vision, and Dr. Liang's office will lead you through each of those choices. If you're contemplating cataract surgery, I highly recommend you have an evaluation by Dr. Keith Liang.</text>

<Text>I've been wearing glasses since the 3rd grade, and fast forward twenty-one years later, I'm getting married. I come from a Punjabi Sikh family, and my family recommended I look into getting contacts since glasses and a turban don't carry the same pizazz as peanut and jelly. Plus, it turns out contacts, and I don't get along.

I was always intrigued by LASIK surgery, and this year was it. I was referred to Dr. Liang by my family friend, who's an optometrist, and it so happens she had LASIK surgery done by Dr. Liang. She was highly satisfied with her outcome, thus which prompted me to reach out to Dr. Liang.

From the initial moment of walking in to post-surgery, my experience with Dr. Liang and his staff has been excellent! The receptionists are professional and well-trained. Christine, the gal who handles billing and eye exams, is exceptionally kind, well-informed, and she makes sure you are knowledgeable about everything.

Dr. Michaels, who's an optometrist and a former patient of Dr. Liang, makes sure you’re doing okay and does an excellent job of explaining the process and when/what medicine to use. Plus, she offers cool tips on what eye care products to use!

Lastly, Dr. Liang, he's an honest, cool, calm, collected, kind, sneaker savvy, and intelligent doctor! He knows his stuff, and his humor is on point. He does a great job of ensuring you’re a good candidate for surgery and keeps you informed throughout the process.

One of the best self-investments I have made in my life! It's great to have 20/20 vision again; I can't thank Dr. Liang, Dr. Michaels, Christine, and his staff enough!

I can't wait to pose for my wedding photos, haha.

You won't be disappointed! :)< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I'm getting PRK on Friday. After three different consultations, I chose Dr. Liang because he took the time to thoroughly answer my questions. I didn't even get to meet the surgeon at the other consultations. I'll post an update after the procedure!</Text>

< Review>
Dr. Liang has always been prompt, answered all of my questions, and has made me feel comfortable. His support staff is great as well. The office is transparent with pricing, professional, and courteous. I had my Lasik procedure completed with Dr. Liang upon a recommendation, and I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone else.</Review>

Dr. Liang and his entire professional support staff are simply the best! Caring, attentive, sensitive, and oh so compellingly competent. In their hands, I felt safe and cared for. But here's the kicker: Now, I can see like I haven't in years! Dr. Liang is good---very good---at his craft. I'd fly across the country to be treated by this very friendly and smooth running team . . .</Text>

<review>I was referred to Dr. Liang by my optometrist. My basic cataract surgery with Dr. Liang was flawless.  I’m convinced that his exceptional skill level made it so. In addition, his support staff was professional, cordial and efficient.  I highly recommend Dr. Liang to anyone needing cataract surgery.< /review>< pics>

I took my mom to get cataract surgery and it was a GREAT experience! Dr. Liang and his staff are wonderful, caring and highly professional. They offer superior customer service and genuinely show they care for their patients. God bless Dr. Liang and his staff for all that they do! THANK YOU!

Dr. Liang runs a highly professional and efficient office. He is quite obviously a very skilled eye surgeon. I am half way through cataract replacement surgery and am seeing with 20/20 vision in that eye the next day with no discomfort. Having had 20/600 my whole life I can’t wait for the second eye to be complete< /Text>

<text>I drove in from RENO to have Dr. Liang do my LASIK surgery. I am originally from Detroit and wanted to have it done by one of the best and Dr. Liang DID NOT DISAPPOINT! I had minor apprehension about doing LASIK in the first place because the eyes are so delicate. I had glasses and contact lenses for three years and my vision continued to deteriorate and I decided to bite the bullet. I could not be more HAPPY! Immediately following my surgery, I had a dream sleep and woke up with crystal clear vision and no astigmatism! It was like seeing for the first time; I am seeing things now that I hadn't seen even before corrective lenses.

I could not be happier with the result or recovery. In addition, Dr. Laing's staff, including Waleed and Dr. Jen were AMAZING. They schedule and meet for each appointment in an organized and timely fashion and completely put you at ease. If you haven't checked out his credentials, take a look at Dr. Liang's education and fellowship online. Do not trust your eye surgery with just anyone. Go to the BEST. See Dr. Liang.  You will not be disappointed!</text><gmapID>0x809ad09431dcec97:0x3a7858a539113982<//gmapID>< time>

<Review>I had RK done in 1986.  About eight years ago I started losing my vision in my right eye.  After multiple doctors I found dr. Liang.  I was falling down and was having trouble driving because of my poor site in my eye.   Glasses could only give me a portion of my site.   He has made my life wonderful again.  Had lens replacement surgery and I am now able to see clearly and I can see colors again too.  He changed my life for the better.  I know my circumstance was not the norm but he’s amazing.  I was nervous about the surgery but the day of his staff was fantastic.  They made me feel comfortable.   Thank you Dr. Liang and thank you to your team.</Review>< username>

<user_id>115008618544254402729<//user_id><review>Dr Liang did the full treatment on both my eyes in 2016.
At first I was only going to do my worse eye but the results were so dramatic when I compared the two eyes after the surgery for clearness, brightness, color, sharpness -- everything was so much better I went ahead with the other eye which I hadn't thought was bad!
Distance vision is now 20-20, and I see clearly at night for driving which was beginning to be a problem. It even seems that my depth perception is better.
Reading vision is almost 20-20 and in good light I rarely need readers. I need no aid seeing my computer screen clearly.
It's a rare menu in a dark place that I cannot read without aid, although the finest print (the stuff they don't want you to read!) might need readers.
The results are better than were predicted, The doctor and his entire staff are truly "out of sight" -- they are so considerate, caring, and competent I was disappointed when they told me I didn't have to come back for a year!</review>< pictures>

<review>Dr Liang is brilliant! I had been told my whole life that my vision was so poor it was not correctable. My optometrist Dr Bradley Chin finally recommended I go see Dr Liang! So glad I did! He corrected my astigmatism and my vision of (20/800). I am 4 months out and have had an incredible experience! Absolutely life changing! I'm 33 years old and am so blessed and grateful to Dr Liang that I can finally see! I would recommend everyone I know to see him! Dont spend the rest of your life thinking your vision cant be helped!

My experience with Dr. Liang at the Center for Sight was superlative.  His friendly and courteous staff took great care of me and my examinations were very thorough.  Dr. Liang is a top flight MD and my cataract surgery came out beyond my expectations. Dr. Liang personally saw and examined me during my recovery period during each visit.  I am extremely happy with the result.  Terry Riley< /Text>

I was very nervous to do either one but decided to seek out the best Eye Surgeon in town. I had many referrals but Dr Liangs name was the one that kept coming up. I was told by someone, I have known for quite awhile and his option was very trusted, to go see Dr Liang. I did my orientation with Dr Liang and felt very comfortable that he was the one for this. He is very knowledgeable, very recommended and did an amazing job. I went in not able to see near or far and came out with 20-20 vision. The world is a whole lot more colorful and I can read anything put in front of me. Best decision I ever made.

< Review>
I had LASIK done here about 2 years ago, and it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.  I am a very active person and love playing sports, snowboarding, swimming, etc. When I was dependent upon contacts, it was a hassle and huge inconvenience to do those things without worrying about my contacts drying up or falling out.  Now I never have to worry about that again thanks to Dr.Liang and his staff.  Everyone there is very professional and friendly and I felt completely comfortable with Dr.Liang performing my surgery.  After 2 years, my vision is still 20/20 and I am completely free of corrective lenses!  Thank you Dr.Liang!</Review>

< review>
We’ve eaten from here quite a few times during the pandemic era.  The food’s always ready when they say it will be and they’ve never messed up an order.  It’s tasty and interesting and they have pretty good cocktails - you pays, but you gets.  Today, though, perhaps the bar wasn’t being run by the A team in the middle of the afternoon.  Should I have to wait half an hour for them to sort out what should have been ready when I arrived?  They were apologetic but there was never an order to comp me anything.  The food is a little salty for my taste.</review>

Got food poisoning from their Claypot Salmon that landed me in the ER on 4/11/21. Will post a longer review with more details when I've figured out how to fit everything in the character limit.<//Text>

Great for a group dinner, people watching, and eating excellent Asian fusion food. Gives you all the reason to step out and grab a bite. The entrees are good, and so are the cocktails. While the starters are good - I highly recommend the Satays and fried cauliflower - a few more options would be great. Wok prawns spicy finished the meal well. Did not try the deserts though this time.<//review>

My fiancé and I were planning on having a nice night out. We've been going through a lot and really needed it. I talked about Straits and told him how amazing it was and really talked it up. We got to the outside lounge and the host said we could stay for about an hour before bottle service. We got to our seats and she served us water. Then we sat there for 30min watching everyone come in AFTER US get served drinks and food. NO ONE came to take our order, or check on us. I even made eye contact with two waiters and still no one came. We left and mentioned it to the host who also saw that we were not served and did nothing about it. Listen. We are all grown. If you don’t want to seat us because you are moving into bottle service time, or short staff, then just tell us you are full and cant seat us.< /text>

Covid nightmare. Overcrowded, staff polishing cutlery with masks under their chins. Piles of dirty hand towels in the bathroom. Spoke to manager, who didn't really care. Guests allowed to walk around with no masks.. no hand sanitizer. Come on guys.< /Review>

Great food, fast service, and safe COVID precautions. I really liked the Ginger Singaporean Soda and the garlic noodles. Most of the dishes that we ordered were kid friendly and the service was quick. Everyone was wearing masks, social distancing and the food came very quickly. Overall, we had as great of an experience as before the pandemic.< /text>

An "oldie but a goodie" on Santana Row. In the before times it was a great venue for birthday parties and private events, now it's a great spot for outdoor dining. The patio on the side has heat lamps overhead to keep diners comfortable. The tables on the street has freestanding heat lamps.
Service can be a bit slow to start but once food is ordered it shows up quickly, fresh, and hot.
Sushi sampler was the one disappointing dish - nothing bad, but nothing special.
Shaking Beef was better than I remembered with perfect medium rare steak. Lobster tail garlic noodles was delightful.
Drinks are beautifully made. Highly recommended for a nice dinner out.</Review>

<Review>The atmosphere is nice and the food is decent. The food we ordered was sesame glazed chicken, which was very tasty, definitely recommend that. The place follows Covid protocols but few of the seats are placed right on the sidewalk, which seems a bit too close to people literally walking by you.</Review>< pictures>

Food and wait staff is great however they do not serve food for people at the table at the same time. I was half finished before my dinner partner got her meal.  Ruined the dining experience</review>

My favorite restaurant when I come to Santana Row. The only problem is super long wait if coming during the weekend. Highly recommend Chicken Lollipops, Shrimp Scampi, Deep Fried Brussel Spouts. Excellent service.< /Text>

Straits is back in full bloom with pre-covid like crowd. Lots of outdoor seating. Good service and you get your food fast.

Getting back here after a long covid lockdown. Feel somehow the taste and flavors have changed. Possibly new chef and cooking team. Roti prata is good as always. Crispy cauliflower was too bland and not cooked well. Nasi goreng (fried rice) ordered with both brown and white rice was lacking the flavor or taste that I’ve experienced here before. Tried ‘Sentosa’ cocktail thinking that may be their specialty since it’s Singaporean but it wasn’t any good.

Overall, good place to hangout but expectations for food should be lowered.<//Text>

To the manager - during winter, give your hostess’ a heater! Can’t be leaving the first point of contact for your restaurant freezing cold outside while the customers are nice n warm 😤< /Review>

<Text>The waiters were nice. But the concierge did not do proper job of explaining how to order, and complained me later about making a pick up order in a rather condescending manner (and I am their patron!, Jesus). Food is just fine.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Horrible taste — so different from Singaporean! I ordered hainan chicken rice, which I frequently ate in Singapore and the chicken wasn’t flavorful, the ginger side dish was so salty and the soup that comes with it tasted so different. It’s overpriced. They should hire Singaporean cooks or have their cooks try the food in Singapore, if they plan on imitating and serving Singaporean.</review>

<text>Their food is fantastic.... definitely one dish can be shared by 2 easily; presentation is fabulous, waiters are nice and very well maintained, their cocktails are little over priced, specially wines, but it’s a perfect place for any type of hang out... ( date, family dinner, girls out or so), will definitely go there again.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Walk in service, with only outdoor seating on sidewalk. Tables 6 feet apart. Beautiful summer morning for a cheese and bacon quiche. They also have a vegetarian quiche.  Pastries galore with specialty coffee to order. Wonderful.  A big YES!< /review>< userid>

Love this place. The food is really good and the drinks are awesome. Our waiter, Adrian, was amazing and super fast and helpful.  The garlic noodles with chicken were my favorite. Usually,  I'm not a fan of brussel sprouts but the way they prepared it, it's just perfect. It was sweet and tangy and soft. The calamari was also really soft and so yum with their white sauce.</Text>

Impressed with the taste of the food and also price. I thought food will be very pricey, because of location, but I was wrong. We liked the Roti parata and Garlic Noodles. Vegetable curry was pretty good too. I am not a great fan of brown rice, but brown fried rice was very tasty as well. Good place to visit if you are visiting Santana row!<//review>

Nice place to grab a drink or dinner at Santana Row. Has a gluten free menu with many choices and the staff is aware of allergies. Can be pretty loud on weekends and also very busy.</text>

Just like the name describes, food is Asian fusion with s blend of southern Malaysian, Singaporean & some extents Indonesian.

I had a very bad experience. Waited for my food for almost 45 minutes. Looks like they forgot my order. I changed my table due to the chaotic location, none of the servers helped me, I had to carry my own plates and glasses.
Lacks a lot in mannerisms and serving etiquettes.< /Text>

I don't know why this place has below 4 stars. I went there with friends and absolutely loved the food we ordered. The chicken satay , garlic noodles and traditional chicken with broth were mind blowing! The ambience was quiet and nice. Good for office lunches. Would definitely love to go again.< /text>

<Text>Came here for drinks. It was the middle of the afternoon so there was barely anyone at the bar and yet we had to wait for a long time to get served. They put straws in their drinks (even glasses of water) which is an automatic loss of a star for me. Be environmentally conscious, it's not too much to ask. Overall experience was average, can't comment on the food because didn't eat here. Please stop with the straws!<//Text>< userid>

< Review>
Pros:
- Food was great, decent portions for the price
- ambiance is awesome, feels like sitting right on Santana Row.

Cons:
- terribly understaffed
- orders weren't just right. We asked for no straws in our drinks, and we got straws. We asked for extra spicy entrees and they were mild.

We went on July 3, and they had two main hostesses that were taking orders on our half of the restaurant. It took forever for us to get our checks and that really soured our mood, but those hostesses were doing all they could. The orders being off is probably a result of how understaffed they were.

The dishes were great though, and the drinks were interesting. Also, 6 people ate, along with drinks for $200 before tip (we shared dishes), which I think is a good price, especially considering it's on Santana Row.< /Review>

< Review>
Having lived in Singapore a while, I was really looking forward to this. I can’t say I was disappointed but I wasn’t wowed too. Maybe my expectation was too high. I asked our server if the Laksa would be a proper Laksa and he guaranteed me it would be...he was wrong. But then I thought maybe he hadn’t had a Laksa in Singapore. Maybe my my past experiences were lost when I left Asian years ago. We ordered a few dishes and the food was great (just not what you would have in Asian). The drinks were a little pricey but then you are on Santana Row. I suggest you eat here as you it will give you glimpses of Asian cuisine but if you want the real thing, you will have to go to Asian (or my country...Australia)!! Thanks for trying guys!!< /Review>

Service was ok. Not good not great nor terrible. Just ok. Food... Well 1 out of 4 dishes was mediocre. Ordered the BBQ chicken and well the chicken was flavorless and barely warm. The soup that comes with the chicken had good flavor but was cold. The rice and salad stole the show, simply amazing.< /review>

<text>Sat down at a sidewalk table as indicated by hostess. Water arrived quickly. No sign of a server for ~10 minutes. Asked bus boy to tell server we are ready to order. Took almost 5 more minutes. We understand it's Covid but we've tried to support restaurants either via takeout or recently outdoor dining, and this has been the worse. The person who took out order may have just been jumping into the breach... Hopefully the food will be close to how it was pre-Covid. Will edit... So far, not impressed.

Update: food was good. Not as hot as could be; several of the dishes that we ordered should have been premade (ribs appetizer, beef rengdang, garlic noodles) and they came out quickly. I'd say the taste was 80% of pre-Covid quality, which is not bad considering... Many other places are 60%.  Raising review from 2 to 3 stars.  Oh, an important datum: we had arrived before 5pm for reasons, so they weren't that busy. It could have been between shifts, I guess.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Poor service. Food was served late and cold. For the  price range we expect a much better service. Would not recommend this place.
Also spicy here is very sweet, beware.< /Review>

Samosa’s to Risotto to basil chicken, crab cakes popcorn chicken, vegetable fried rice and more for a party of 9.  Good seating. Great ambiance. Not very pricey. In fact very good value for money. Easy parking as well.<//Review>< Pics>

Service is good. The waiter is polite and attentive to us. Atmosphere is terrible. Covid seems really made straits a sad place. Everything rans down. The Food Quality is terribe. We order the sea food platter and other three dishes.

Sea food platter is really not fresh. There are yellow ring stain on the inner shell on all the shells. There was a dried fly stuck on the shell. When I showed the hostess, she told me it is a black spot. Salmon is too hard to chew. We left majority of the food untouched. Now I just hope that we do not get food poisoning.

Spicy street noodle is not spicy and chicken is hard in the pai Thai. What is really going on at straits. We used to life it a lot the quality is really going down.</review>

Great food. This place has nailed how to cook vegetables. The curry cauliflower appetizer was great! The salad was awesome. I'm a meat eater but I seem to like my vegetables at this place better than the meat dishes.  My wife's grilled chicken was dry but she said it tasted ok. That's the only reason for the missing star. I would give it 4 1/2 stars.< /Review>

<Response>None<//Response><review>I wish I could do 0 stars. First and definite last time visiting this “restaurant”. Yeah, service was quick but the portions were TINY. Even the entrees. We ordered buttered prawns. Not a mountain of bread crumb covering 5 pieces of  baby shrimp. The lamb was SOAKED in grease. Ordered Sea-bass as an entree, and got barely a espresso sized portion of fish with a couple pieces of mushroom and bell pepper. Overpriced for mediocre food. Ordered 2 drinks, a way overpriced appetizers at 18 bucks a pop, and 2 entrees and paid over $130. Please do yourself a favor and ignore the appealing physical appearance of this place and it’s laid back aesthetic and save yourself the torture. if you’re looking for a romantic night out, this is not the place you’re looking for, let alone ever.</review>< gmap_id>

The atmosphere here is nice, quiet and modern. We got seated fast which was nice for a Saturday. Most of the food we ordered was tasty, some not as much .. the chicken satay and phad Thai was good but nothing great, the portion size was no bueno to say the least. Usually when you go to restaurants that serve family style the portions are alot bigger and would better reflect why your paying so much... but I guess that just comes with Santana Row.. The bar and lounge area looked nice to do drinks and appetizers but I don't think I'll be back here for lunch or dinner....</Text>

<review>The brunch was some of the best I've ever had. The Chicken Tikka Masala Chilaquiles and the soft shell crab and grits were different that anything I've had, and both dishes were phenomenal. They also had $15 mimosas and bloody mary's. Only basing this rating off their brunch as it's been too long since I've had anything else there.</review>< Pictures>

< review>
Great location right along Santana Row

If you arrive just before dinner time, you can easily get seated. The hostesses were very accommodating with my need to work and eat and plug in my laptop. They seated me in an area where I could do my phone calls and work while I ate. The menu is different if you are seated at the lounge vs the dining area and drinks are different prices too.

Menu selection is great in both the dining area and lounge. Lots of exotic dishes that is a fusion of American and Asian cuisine. Prices aren’t too bad with a lot of entrée dishes under $30. Beverage selection is pretty good and prices are average. The portions are a little on the small side but very tasty. Service was good from the time you are seated to the time you finish off. They didn’t have any issues with me moving about the restaurant and changing tables.

It gets a little loud as the night progresses because of the music and a different crowd encroaches. It seems like a usual hangout for business visitors though.

I ordered the Pan Seared Salmon for $20. It was really unique with all my favourite flavours mixed in from cilantro to lemongrass chili sambal and mango salsa sauce. Salmon was done perfectly. I would go back again but the only unfortunate thing about Santana Row is that most of the restaurants are closed by around 11pm.</review>

But food the department went down so much since my last visit. All the food we ordered came in less than 5 minutes since we placed the order. I was bit surprised at the speed of preparing the meals. It felt kitchen warming up the cold food to achieve this speed. There was no flavor, or too spicy. Specially, Indian chicken dish was from packed Costco meals.

We were so disappointed and doubt will be coming back anytime soon.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<Text>Such a fun vibe! Love this place now, my first time and I will for sure be coming back! Great DJ and good music selection. The people in there were having a lot of fun! Bar wasn't overcrowded, but not empty. Attracts a fun crowd that likes to dance and listen to top 40 hip-hop! Such a fun experience!!<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Came here on a Saturday night.  Its an interesting concept (restaurant turn "club"/lounge).  Personally, the music didn't work for me... its not quite there to be club level, but its not quite chill enough to be a lounge either.  Plus the selection is predominately hip-hop through time.  Perhaps catering to local tastes?  The four star is entirely for the food, because its amazing.  Highly recommend the Nasi Goreng (Indonesian fried rice) and the Brussels sprouts<//review>< Pictures>

The Food and service were great. Large open seating area. Drinks were $15 bucks so a bit pricey there. The lounge area is a great place to grab dinner and watch the game or hang out< /Text>

Way overpriced, no service and bad business model<//review>< pictures>

The lobster garlic noodle came out more buttery than garlicy and dear daughter & husband did not enjoy it. The lobster was unfortunately rubbery tonight.
Roti, ahi tuna, lollipop chicken, pork belly slider and calamari were enjoyed by the family and recommended. I thoroughly enjoyed the spicy laksa that I was craving.< /review>< date>

Great ambiance and food! I find that some of the food is very sweet. I had brussel sprouts and whole red snapper fish. Both had sauce that was sweet af! I enjoyed it but man did I have a sugar rush and have to drink lots of water. I'd still come back here tho every time I have a spa day at Burke Williams.<//Text>

Food was great, especially roti prata and samosa. Fried rice was  good too but noodles wasn't tasty at all.
Ambiance was good.
Service wasn't that great. We had to wait very long for someone to come in and take the order. Every time we wanted water or order more, there wasn't anyone around to take the order.< /review>

Let me put it this way...You are a group of friends hanging out in Santana Row and you walk past Straits. From the outside it looked like a decent place. So you decided to sit in the lounge and have a good time. You waited for sometime and expected someone to come and serve you, clean your table or take your order for drinks and food. You waited and waited for several minutes and loose your patience.  No eminent sign of customer service. Thats exactly whats going to happen if you go here! So don’t ruin your beautiful evening and save your patience. This place is the WORST customer service. Food is nice don’t take me wrong. But to get to the point where you can enjoy your drinks and food, you have had already wasted a lot of time and probably gotten a bit frustrated. Hope this helps.< /Text>

Extra star for being clean and having good service. The food is not good, honestly. There is a strange mixture of cultural cuisines with no obvious cohesion. Chicken was undercooked, sauces were all very vinegary. Would not recommend going here unless you want to spend a lot for a little</text>

< Review>
Have heard great things about this restaurant and wanted to try since we only visit San Jose to see my grandparents.  Due to the convenience of charging our Tesla at supercharger we decided to give it a try.  We were in love with the ambient, the music and trendy lounge/restaurant setting.  Service was warm and attentive.  Loved our dirty martini and hot tea for my beloved Wife.  Fish is our favorite so we ordered what was listed first in the seafood section, tuna tartare, sashimi (missing the hamachi but didn’t even get a notice, just come out as if I didn’t remember what I ordered) so just tiny slices of low grade ahi and salmon.  And we also ordered the muscles which the sauce was great but the mussels were over cooked and a bit on the rotten side...should have sent those back but what the heck, it was our first time and I really like the staffs and bar tender who mixed a bomb kettle one dirty martini.  The food was disappointing, except for the tuna tartare.  I gave an average tip because the dish sent out anyway knowing that there was no hamachi, could’ve consulted and letting me know I would appreciate that.  Anyway, I would come back for the drinks and atmosphere  but I will not try the sashimi or mussels ever!!! 😕😔< /Review>

Was there for lunch. Had one of the worst customer service experiences ever. Servers literally throw dishes on the table. It was not busy at all. Got their special poke dish which resembled more of a sushi roll than a poke. When I asked repeatedly for soy sauce, which was not available at my table, I got salt instead. There were only chopsticks, had to ask for a fork, which the server forgot to bring the first time around. No water refills either. I am usually a happy customer and was in a good mood when I got there. I do not think the problem was in me. The servers looked relatively young, inexperienced and lacking motivation. Most of the time salary is the culprit of the subpar customer service. The management should definitely address the cause.< /text>

Atmosphere and food menu option is great. If you are looking for Asian inspired cuisine worth trying. Moscow mules tasted great. Service mixed up a lot of orders at our table. Pad Thai 2 Stars, it tasted very dry would have been better with more sauce.< /text>

Third bad experience in a row. This forced me to leave a feedback. Food quality is average at best and the service at Straits is consistently BAD. I’ve experienced everything from no one showing up to take your drinks order for 40 minutes to missed items from order, incorrect billing etc etc.
There are much better restaurants in this area. Save your money and go someplace else to enjoy a good lunch or an enjoyable evening.<//review>

Great ambience, food and service. Malay / Singaporean food. Try the back ribs, Laksa, watermelon-steak salad. It may be a bit noisy, but expected from younger and energetic crowd. Worth a visit.< /Review>

<Review>WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
Absolutely horrible experience. Glo and I went for lunch to celebrate our tenth anniversary.
Stay-cation kinda thing. So we try Straits for the first time.
This was an absolute disaster.
The hostess seats and says your server is -------.  About 20 minutes and 1&1/2 glasses of water later just as we start to question eating there another server introduces herself and asked if the original server had been by. We say no so she said she is assisting him and will help us.
I asked for Calamari with corn starch instead of flour. We also place our entree order being we've been waiting so long we know the menu.
The server returns and says the CHEF? said "he can't prep it that way". A so called CHEF and he can't do this. Maybe it was beyond his skill level. Not IMPOSSIBLE if he's a "CHEF".
So, no appetizer.
So the server brings me a GF menu and asks if I want to change my dish. I say sure. I'd like the salmon. She returns with that look like, "this ain't going well" and says the chef is only prepping salmon for dinner and not for lunch. Someone please explain that to me!
Sure. I'll stay with the original order.
We order the Banana Salad and a Yellow Curry. About 30 seconds later a third server brings us a salad and a green curry. We look at each other and tell him this can't be ours. I honestly said. Is this a fast food restaurant.
He gives my wife the salad and then tries to give me the curry and said this really can't be ours. It's not right. He picks up the curry and tries 2 other tables before he realizes it belong to the table next to us. The salad belonged to them also. So now they have to fix that table also.
Five ladies at a four top having a good time so they probably didn't mind YELP it.
I end up waiting about 20 minutes again and ask 2 servers for assistance. Looking for the order taking server. No luck. Ask 3 people to refill the Endless mimosa which is becoming a pain to get refilled.
I actually walked over to the bar and asked the bartender to send some mimosa over. Finally a manager named S-------io comes over with a lost look and asks if I need some help. I explain to him how mind boggling things are going so he offers to assist. I watch him go to the POS and review our order. He talks to both servers and the "CHEF". A moment later I see the chef bring him a bowl and........
The manager drops it.  Really. No kidding. He dropped the bowl.
Poor kid, he takes off and walks to the back of the kitchen. That's why I call him a kid. I guess maybe he's embarrassed. I keep watching because I'm laughing at this point thinking, can it get worse.
A few minutes later he brings me a bowl.  He tells me please be careful because it's HOT. Guess what. Hot?  Who are you kidding.
Still trying to get mimosa. I should have brought a flask. I literally asked nine times for 2 refills.
He never came back. Not MANager enough I guess. We eat.
I smile at my wife and tell her happy anniversary and apologize for picking this JOKE of endless JOKES as our special outing.
She smiles back and tells me.
I BET THE ONLY THING WE GET IN A REASONABLE TIME IS THE CHECK.
Guess what came about a second later. Maybe she saw them coming from behind me.
The manAGER comp'ed my curry only.  This place is truly head scratching as a successful restaurant.  I should have look for a camera crew to walk in any moment and ask "What would you do"?</Review><gmapID>0x808fcae00584be5f:0x1f519e646edac40c< /gmapID>< Rate>

<Review>The portions say family size but I would order per person.  Especially on a busy night when your waiting around a while, you'll build up an appetite waiting. The price definitely reflects a family style portion but that's not what you get, although it is  delicious. At night the lounge is a great place for drinks and hanging out.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><user>103849718284864069919<//user>< gmap_id>

This place is always packed on the weekends, so I went in mid-week for a late lunch, and the place wasn't very crowded.  Had the papaya leaf salmon with green mango salad.  It came with a medium spicy peanut sauce.  Pretty tasty, but ask your waiter for a small side of rice to complete the meal.  The salad was a little sweet, but was a good counterpoint to the spiciness of the peanut sauce.< /review>

Straits used to be the best spot in Santana Row, I used to come here all the time with friends.  Last 2 times I went, I waited about 20 minutes before I was acknowledge by one of their staff members who would be right back.... do you think they came back?  Left after waiting another 10 minutes.  If you are able to get service, their food is really, really good</review>

<Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808fcae00584be5f:0x1f519e646edac40c< /gmap_id><Text>Food was okay, nothing special. I’m mostly leaving 2 stars because of the service. My fiancé and I were blatantly treated like we weren’t going to buy a lot while the people next to us who were dressed in a suit and a name brand dress were treated far better. We both had the same server, but he spent like 2 minutes with us max and assumed we wanted waters didn’t ask if we wanted anything to drink. Another waiter had to get us water when he noticed our drinks were empty, 20 minutes after we asked our waiter for water. Our waiter spent a good 15 minutes asking about if the people next to ya wanted drinks and trying to give them suggestions. We were treated like we weren’t worth the time because we were both in our work clothes. And in the end when I told my fiancé I didn’t want desert because I didn’t want to stay there any longer the guy suggested desert places on Santana Row to us like we’d never been there suggesting cheaper desert places.

And to top it off Straits charges a fare fee which is basically their way of getting customers to pay for their servers minimum wage.< /Text></record>

Great place to talk business, chill, catch a game while being taken care of by a great customer service oriented staff.  Wide selection of liquors and beers.  Food is good.  Enjoy...< /text>

Great South-East Asian fusion fare. Good service and a good place to be. Gets quite loud during the evening or at night. But you can always go for a quieter brunch or lunch. I love the "Banana Leaf Salmon" that they serve.<//review>

I haven’t been to Straits in years.  I had a dinner recently to celebrate my friend’s post-birthday.  The service was the highlight of the evening, with staff refilling our water glasses regularly (even long after we finished eating and were just chatting) and the waitress offering me a complimentary glass of red wine after they ran out of my two original choices.  The perfectly prepared French Fries with two different dipping sauces was delicious. The Pad Thai and Spicy Noodle were flavorful but a tad too sweet.  The disappointment was the bland Eggplant.<//text>

<Text>Love this place. The food is very good, haven't found a dish I dont like yet. The portions have gotten smaller since we first started going here, but the taste is still good. The tamarind beef is to die for, you must try it. Low key ambiance until evening, then the dance music comes on and the bar area starts to fill up.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Excellent atmosphere with outdoor dining available overlooking the strip. The food was phenomenal and great portions for the price. There was a problem with my order and it took a little longer than normal, but the waitress, manager on duty, and chef all came to my table and personally apologized. Great customer service. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good Asian food.</Review>

Straits is a great place to sit down and have a quiet talk with a friend or group of friends.

It usually gets loud and fun at night. People are nice, they dress nice and everyone's friendly.

Great selection of cocktails and food. There is no way you will miss the target when you come here.< /Text>

<Review>Everything was perfect!  We had a great time.  Service was excellent and our food came out at the right times.  We had a thinly sliced rare beef appetizer (I do not remember the name), chili-crab, and Pad Thai.  I would encourage you to throw the Pad Thai noodles into the chili crab sauce (so good).< /Review>< user_id>

Surprisingly good food. Their laksa is pretty okay, but I was surprised to see it on the menu in the first place. The major negative about this place is the music they put on during the weekends. I think they’re trying to have some sort of lounge vibe going on, but it really ruins the vibe for the dining customers. We were unable to really converse with our group due to the noise levels. If they had full-fledge dancing I’d be cool with it, but it seemed kind of lame to be blasting top 40s for people in suits sipping cocktails on couches.</review>

the spare ribs were DELICIOUS!! we also split an order of the garlic noodles which was quite tasty and a good deal considering how much food is in this little appetizer. In addition to this, the drinks were not only tasty but strong enough to give me a good start to my birthday.

to top it off you can sign up for their birthday club online and get a free appetizer with purchase of entree.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Ordered a tasteless chicken and waffles and chicken sandwich that inexplicably took 45 minutes to make on a casual Sunday. Place was at best 30% full. Watched three other tables sit down, order, eat, and pay before we got our food. At least our server was attentive and came by to apologise about the kitchen, though I'm not sure what's going on there if other tables were getting food in a timely manner.< /text>

Straits seemed like a nice enough place until we asked for a couple more minutes to look at the menu. It then took 15 minutes just to be serviced again. The food was subpar and the service throughout the meal was downright bad. I’m certain they are working hard to attend so many tables both indoors and outdoors, but I can’t recommend this place with good conscience.</Text>

<Review>Selling itself as a “Singapore home style” restaurant, the reality is more “grab bag of popular dishes from India and Southeast Asia”.

Food is not bad, but overly sweet and not spicy at all. The roti w sauce was surprisingly addictive.

Ambiance is somewhere between power-outage chic and Jersey Shores pick-up bar.

Service is attentive to the point of obsequious, yet somehow still lacking …</Review>< Pictures>

I came here after reading an article on Chris Yeo preparing poh pia with his grandmother. However, the poh pia is not like what I had in Singapore at all. :'( :'( The version served here felt like a Vietnamese summer roll miniaturized into Spanish tapas. The char kway teow lacked wok power. The laksa tasted mildly of stale prawns.<//Review><rating>2< /rating>< userid>

<Review>Arrogant manager, slow service, charging for dishes they never brought to the table.

We had my husband's birthday party on Monday night, place was not busy, but it took more than 15 min to get the drink orders.
We ordered number of dishes and to be fair, food was good.
Bill had some item priced at $33, that we never got. I asked waiter to remove it from the bill. He did removed that dish, but  said that manager have SEEN that dish going from the kitchen.
Obviously, we did not receive that dish, so I asked to clarify that with manager. It took manager 20 -25 min get back to me. She not only have not apologised, she   spoke in very arrogant manner that she really see that dish going out. That was ridiculous!!! Just go and ask your waiter where did he take that dish, and apologize to your customer. They charged 20%of service fee mandatory for the big group...< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Date>1507620191797< /Date>< user>

Straits has a really interesting mix of Indo-Chinese food allowing for a wide variety of available cuisines. I thought the food was fantastic though I didn't enjoy the "club" vibe too much. I understand that that is what it turns into in the night, but I thought it was a little too early for that when I went for dinner.< /Review>

Love this place for happy hour!

They have cheap appetizers and a good selection of it too (roti, garlic noodles, chicken lollipops, calamari, corn croquettes, it goes on).

Ambiance is trendy, music is awesome, and the crowd is your good mix of young and old professionals, all somewhat dressed to impress.<//review>

They have no clue of waiting times. We were told 30 minutes, and it took them about 105 minutes to get us a table. If you don't have space, be upfront about it. You cannot cheat. They must realize they are in customer service business, not the other way around.< /Review>

The first time that we had dinner here, it was a great and pleasant experience. So we came back. And every time it got worse... They changed the recipe I think and my favorite plate now tastes really bad. The service is terrible! I don't think that I go back again. We gave them chance... I just don't give them 1 star because of the fantastic first time experience...< /text>

<review>Very poor service - after ordering drinks, waited for 15-20 minutes just to get our order of beer. After another long delay in serving food, they brought each dish with about 10-15 gap between the dishes, so the food started getting cold. Seems like they have serious staff shortage.<//review><rating>2< /rating></record></dataset><record>

Terrible service. I felt like I was being ignored and we had to chase down the waiter each and every time we wanted something. I was shamed by friends into tipping him because they felt sorry for him. I would never go back to this place again based on the service. Food and atmosphere was good though.< /Text>

I came here for happy hour and was a little underwhelmed.  The drinks were watered down, the order was messed up and it was so incredibly loud in there that you could barely hear anyone talking.

Not a huge fan, but still had a fun time since I was with friends!<//Review>

The food has declined over the years. But the service is good. If you go expect to pay $10 for a place in Man Jose. The atmosphere is good, but not worth that.</review>

<Text>A fly flew out of our food and then the management decided it was a good idea to be rude and condescending.  Over priced food and horrible service (at least this location).  I got in contact with corporate who said that management would call and fix things and never did.  The appetizer came AFTER the main course (how hard is it to get oysters out?).  The list goes on.<//Text>< GmapID>

<review>Food came quick but not great, overpriced. Took almost 20 minutes to get a bottle of sparkling water. Music loud so it's difficult to have a conversation without yelling. Bathroom was in very poor condition, only one sink worked and hardly any paper towel to dry hands. Not suitable for kids.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Didnt like the food, the fried rice was just so normal, i had to add salt to eat. The only good thing might have been the ambience</text>

<user>117694109416186891571<//user><Text>Didn't work out for us today. The food was horrible. We ordered from the vegetarian menu and all the dishes were pretty bad. Also they brought out the curry without bringing the rice. Overall, not a great experience. I don't know much about the non-vegetarian options but vegetarians should avoid this place.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

We went for the lunch on the Father's day! Horrible experience.
The food came after 30 mins of the order. The manager informed that they had only one cook. We had ordered thai tofu curry. It did not have tofu in it. The waiter was surprised too when we informed him. He came and told us that they are sorry as they are out of tofu. There was a fork to serve in the curry. The curry came 15 mins before the rice was given. Their food and service has been going down for past few times. We just pay for the ambiance for the over priced food. Can get much better food at half the price outside.< /Text>

Good food and drinks but staff seem lazy due to hostesses chatting with back turned as guests wait and a ladder in the middle of the lounge during business making the gentleman in a wheelchair at a neighboring table self conciousness as staff use the ladder.<//review>

We have dined on the banana blossom salad, chicken satay, roti, chicken lollipops, banana leaf salmon, butter chicken, mee goreng, and a few other dishes. Everything is delicious, but can be on the greasy side and can also sometimes vary in consistency. Nothing a nice cocktail cannot wash down, I assume.

The weekends can get crowded, so be sure to make reservations.</review>< user>

While service isn't always the best, their food and drinks never disappoint! You can't honestly go wrong with anything on the menu, ranging from their seafood crudo, lemongrass mojitos, roti prata or black pepper lobster. I would highly recommend!< /text>

Singapore is known for its flavorful and affordable street foods.  The high prices and loungy atmosphere of Straits misses the mark.<//Review>

The food has been good as always. The service has varied between snooty and absent on the past few visits. Might stop going there now< /review>

Food was delicious but the crab that you have to break apart to eat was discouraging, for the price we pay we shouldn't have to put in that much work to eat our food.</Text>

<time>1390013453448< /time><rating>1<//rating><text>BEWARE Please post if you have been victimized at a Straits Restaurant :
I was a patron in Straits restaurant on the evening of December 19, 2013, following a shopping trip in Santana Row. My boyfriend and I stopped in to have dinner and drinks in your bar.  I inquired to the bartender that my phone was dying and was there a convenient location for me to charge it while we ate. He kindly stated he could charge it behind the bar securely next to the cashwrap.

When we went to retrieve the phone after leaving, we were handed back ONLY the charger, not the phone.  This was a brand new Iphone 5S with 2 months worth of data and content backed up over a 9 year period.

We spoke with the MOD, the bartender and were informed that security cameras could identify the culprit, although that was never done.  Instead we were told to wait until the next day when we would be contacted again by the MOD, Jonathon Young.

We contacted Jonathon the next day and he assured us he would take care of the matter and that we would be reimbursed for the phone since it was clearly stolen from one of your employees. (The bar area is supposed to be secure with only the bartender and bar back entering the secured area.)

Several emails to Mr. Young proved unfruitful. I finally received a phone call from Heather Conry, on January 8. I called her back the same day and left a message as I was traveling.  I called her back again and again, and my boyfriend also called left her repeated messages.  She likely has over 6 messages between us.  It's unconscionable to me why she would reach out initially and then have ZERO follow through.  Im not sure what kind of management team you are running there, but it's unacceptable behavior.

We are considering opting into social media to spread the word of the poor service and treatment you have of your patrons.

Is this how you run a successful customer oriented restaurant ?< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

We chose this location based off the decor. We found out the service was good, but the food was pretty bad. Not impressed and won't go back.</review>

The girl servers are all pretty and thats the only reason I gave them 3 stars. The beer and drink here suck! Food: some are ok, some suck, definitely expensive but what can I say, its Santana Row. Nothing about this place that can make me come again. I just happen to go here a lot because my friends like the environment.

Theres happy hour mon-fri in the afternoon I think. Dont bother with the drink, get the food. The garlic noodles on the Happy Hour menu is pretty good, and probably the only dish that's worth it.<//text>

I have been going to this place for years, and they definitely keep making the dishes smaller and smaller without changing the price. The tamarind beef is absolutely to die for, and it keeps me coming back for sure!</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It is a restaurant where you can eat everything. The best thing is that there are many menus, and the green curry shrimp is too salty. In general, the sweet and salty taste goes well together.

Vegetable Fried Rice, coconut Shrimp Fried Rice, and Pad Thai are easy to eat for those who don't like salty taste.

The recommended dessert is Lava Cake

The dessert I want to avoid is Creme Brulee because it tastes like pumpkin under the caramel. The crème bouillet goes well with the caramel and soft creamy taste... but I remember that this was a ruined dessert by ordering two.

(Original)
무난하게 다 먹을수 있는 식당이다. 가장 좋은것은 많은 메뉴가 있다는것이고,그린커리의 새우는 맛이 너무 짜다. 대체로 맛은 단맛과 짠맛이 잘 어울려져 있다.

짠맛을 싫어하는 사람들이 무난하게 먹을수 있는 메뉴로는 Vegetable Fried Rice , coconut Shrimp Fried Rice, Pad Thai

추천하는 디저트는 Lava Cake

피하고 싶은 디저트는 Creme Brulee  이유는 캐러멜 아래에 호박맛이라니..진짜 아니다 싶다. 크렘뷜레는 캐러멜과 부드러운 크림맛이 어울리는데...이건 2개나 시켜서 망한 디저트였던 기억이 난다.< /review>< user_name>

<text>(Translated by Google) For those who taste from snacks... um.. entertaining can eat. A little expensive! However, it is justifiable in this place, and this is a famous shop! Come here for a taste of Southeast Asian cuisine, the sour and sweet taste is very suitable for summer!

對於從小吃這味的人來說...嗯..應酬吃吃可以。有一點小貴啊！不過在這個地點也是情有可原，而且這可是一間名店唷！來這逛街，嚐嚐東南亞美食，酸酸甜甜的味道很適合夏天的！< /text>< pics>

It looks neat tho, the quality of service is redicurously low.The waiter often behave rudely.I never come here again.

It looks pretty, but the service level of the clerk is too low, so it won't come anymore. If you don't ask me to bring a spoon four times, I wouldn't bring it, or I'd like to bring home a glass even though I've had a glass of wine.

見た目は綺麗だけど、店員のサービスレベルが低すぎるので、もう来ない。スプーン持ってきてほしいと4回お願いしないと持ってこなかったり、ワインを飲みかけにもかかわらず、グラスを持って帰りたいから早く空けろとか、失礼極まりない。<//Text>
