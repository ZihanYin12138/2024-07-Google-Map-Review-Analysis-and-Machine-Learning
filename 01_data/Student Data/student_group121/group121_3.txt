My husband and I recently purchased a vehicle from here. All I can say is that I am beyond amazed of the wonderful people here. They were not pushy whatsoever. Goes to show that they want to make sure the customer is satisfied with the car they choose. Oh, and were satisfied alright. The owners take care of you and make you feel like family.<//text>

Many people have been telling me about this place. Out of all the dealerships I visited this one had the nicest and cleanest cars. Lots of new options to choose from. I bought a 2021 Chevy Silverado with only 1k miles!! Got a great deal and couldn’t be more happy with my purchase. Will definitely be back for my future purchases.< /review>

<text>Really good people here. Always have, always will buy my cars from these guys. Always treated me and my family with respect. Just bought a 2020 Toyota Tacoma. I had previously bought about 6 cars from here already. If you need a car this is the place to go.< /text>< rate>

I’m so happy with my purchase from here. I have been in the search for a car for some time now and I’ve been hearing pretty good things about this place. I decided to go down and now I know why. Great people. The process was smooth and simple. Helped me finally get the right car.< /Text>

Absolute worse place to attempt to buy a vehicle from. My husband and I saw a vehicle we were interested in went ahead with the purchase with just me. Told them my credit score ahead of time. Signed a contract with very HIGH payments but understood due to my low credit score. Took the car home and was very happy at first. Not even days later Sarah from the office calls me and tells my so called loan didn't get approved so they need more than the $5,500 we gave them. They insisted they were trying to help us and would tell the bank that we were family so we could get approved. Went back, signed another contract with my husband as co-signer. Again, they said everything was fine. Sarah called us back a week later saying we didn't get approved together and they need MORE money. After a THIRD contract...yes a THIRD.  The dealership continued to harrass us and call both my husband and I insisting they could only help us if we brought MORE money for a down payment. Needless to say these people are scammers and the owner uses Sarah as their puppet and she gets paid well for it. They ran my credit TWELVE times and 12 hard inquiries appeared on my credit report in a two week period. DONT buy a car from these people! We ended finding the same car different color less mileage and better honest sales people elsewhere. Trust me these ppL are snakes 🐍<//text>

Great dealership and even better people. My wife’s birthday was coming up and I wanted to go big this year. I was doing research and going to a lot of dealerships. Dibwani Motors by far had the nicest cars compared to any of the other dealerships. I ended up purchasing a 2019  Escalade. My wife was very happy with the car. I’m glad I came across Dibwani Motors and will definitely be back to purchase my vehicles here in the future.< /text>

At first I was pretty happy to have bought my first car off the lot a few years ago, but I’ve come to find that these people are thieves. They wouldn’t pay me the rest of the money they owed on a cancelled contract which forced me to bring them to court. DONT BUY A CAR FROM HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET ROBBED FOR MONEY AND LOSE 100 points on your credit score as they shop around with your social security number until they find a loan that benefits them more than anybody else.< /text>

I asked for a 2017 BMW 5 series and showed them the exact one wanted and they got it. I’m glad I was recommended to this place, so I’m going to recommend it to all you guys:)<//Review>< pics>

Be careful they show you false car reports. Purchased a vehicle from them with a "clean history" turns out there were reported accidents.</Text>

<Text>My husband and I really dig this place, came here at least twice for a date night. But for some reason the bartenders always seem too busy for us, takes forever to get a drink. It’s also a surprise to me that people got food at this place cause every time we’ve come they got no munchies, not even chips< /Text>< Time>

The perfect dive bar! Good people. Great prices. Relaxed vibe. The bartenders are all very nice. You can bring in your own food which is pretty awesome. They’re open from 6am to 2pm. Free popcorn. The crowd is friendly and diverse.</text>

Total Dive and totally Fun. $2.50 Well Drinks with lots of locals and newbies having a good time. Cats wander around the bar and always some friendly old Dog asleep in the back patio area. Pretty 420 friendly. Diverse crowd in age, ethnicity, gender, and intellect. Great Bar to drink, meet people, and just hang out. Decent Pool players also.</Review>

This is a quaint little dive bar. If you're local you'll see a lot of familiar faces. Live music on Sundays is great. Take care of the bartenders and they'll take care of you.< /Text>

It's a nice hole in the wall bar that offers one side with a dj and the other side with touchtunes. They allow you to order postmates which is awesome because there are quite a few good places to order from.< /review>

<text>This place is the coolest bar ever. Sunday nights can't be beat. Live blues jam, food, and a Bud Draft, all for $2. The karaoke is pretty good during the week too. I've never seen the usual bar drama at the Desert Room either and that's phenomenal.</text></record></dataset><record>

What's the fuss all about. The legend continues, but the truth will set you free. Cash only, says it all. Smoking and drinking on the patio tells me that you better be able to walk a straight line when you leave.  I witnessed one man being OVER served with a glass of liquor 5x the amount of the mixer.  I'm not happy witnessing this crime, I'm worried if that man is going to kill me on the way home.  A joke! Do not go here if you wish to see your children in the morning.  You'll be in county jail.</Text>

<text>Horrible.. bathrooms are embarrassing and the place needs to be remodeled. I felt like I needed to get checked by a doctor after going thier.The karaoke is out dated to. It seems everyone who works there is in a bad mood. But the drinks are affordable and some of the regular people are nice to each other almost family atmosphere for the regulars.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>I Love this place. I have made myself at home  at The Dessert Room. Never ever judge a bar by its cover...You never know how great it really is on the inside. I have no idea why these pics posted ,but just a great buy at Betty's patio sale one of my favorite    items  $20.  Thank you Betty!!</Text>< pics>

This is definitely the most convenient and well preeminent pawn shop I’ve been to without a doubt. They’re very welcoming and as a Security Shift Supervisor in the corporate customer service field/area, they are on top of it! Sonny is the guy you want to talk to or inquire to if you come and I’m saying that because of my visit. If I was to come again and speak to someone else, I’m sure they would definitely be more than happy to help and assist. Top of the line y’all!!</text>

Just sold some beautiful gold pieces to Yev's. Sonny is not like your average pawn/jewellery shop dealer. He is very friendly and doesn't bs when it comes to price points. He paid me a respectable and fair market price for my items. I was very pleased with my experience at Yev's.< /Review>

Not only was the customer service personable and honest. They also were very generous in pricing with high quality products for sale. If your in the Los Angeles area and looking to loan or purchase a new piece of jewelry look no further.

<Text>I dont think you can find a better place to sell or loan your stuff.  I spent 6 hours and went to more than 7 places looking for a better price than Yev offered me. Had to come back and admit that he was right and that he offered me a good $for each item just like he said. Dont waste your time people like I did. You definitely can trust this place. Everything went smooth, fast and easy after we settled the deal.< /Text>< Pictures>

<text>I had to write a second review on Google because I felt that Yev's deserves two great reviews.

I was in a very dire situation and needed to sell my old HP touch smart computer. I wasn't expecting much, since last time I went to a pawn shop I only got a small amount for my Mac.

So when I called and spoke to Sonny on the phone I was a bit nervous. He explained to me that I would not get as much as I did for the Mac at any of the pawn shops. However after taking a look, Sonny was willing to take a risk and give me double what I would have normally gotten for an HP 15 Touch-smart!

I've had a wonderful experience and would totally recommend! The place is also very clean, and the guys are really chill, and really care. :)

Thanks again guys! ;) You helped me a lot!<//text><user_name>Syd Fox< /user_name>< Resp>

Go here if u are looking for people who really care about the customer and want to help you get what you need. Trust me I tried others around them and no one offered as much or were as compassionate during the process. You won't be disappointed.< /review>< Pics>

They actual go the extra mile for the customer and pay a lot more than other location in the area.  Don't hesitate to call or ask them questions about anything, they will do their best to work with you.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<text>No one wishes upon themselves to be in such a need that they have to pawn something, but if you ever do, Yev’s Jewerly & Loan is the place. The guys will take care of you to the best of their ability and treat you fairly with respect. From someone that’s used them multiple times, i advise you to stop by and give them a try.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1536867768771, 'text': 'Thank you Boubacar for your kind words.

<review>Best Pawn Shop in Hollywood and Los Angeles, without a doubt. No pressure cooker environment, Yev and his employees make you feel at ease and comfortable with the process - and if either side can't work out a deal, no sweat. No hard-sells, no bait and switch tactics. 10/10 I highly recommend Yev's Jewelry & Loan for any of your items, especially when it comes to selling your gold or buying theirs.< /review><Resp>None< /Resp>< user_name>

<Review>I went in to pawn a couple gold rings.  The owner weighed them and told me he would give me $160 for them, right before I left he offered $180. I didn’t take the offer. I went directly across the street and the guys at the shop weighed them, looked up the current price for gold and offered me 80% off the value. I left there with $275.  That’s $95 more than what the would give me at Yev’s!  Don’t pawn your valuables here. Always get a second  appraisal.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Ok let's face it with the economy up & down, $ gets tight and I have had to visit this Shop about 10 times over the last 3 years, I have gotten to meet the owner who has always worked with me and been more than fair, and allowed me to get loans against my property when needed then pay back and get my things back.  I highly recommend this shop, and I will continue to use them when I need a quick loan.</review>

I have a passion for watches,  as well as vintage pieces, rare artwork and antiques. I am a collector
of what I find interesting. In the past twenty-five years I must have visited over 150 Jewelry, Loan and Pawn shops in various states around the US and vintage boutiques in Europe.
From my first experience with the owner Yev Goldman and his entire staff, I have never been treated with a level of service which one would expect buying a 18k Gold Minute Repeater at the Vacheron Constantin Boutique on Rodeo or a 18K White Gold Paul Newman Daytona.
To call Yev's Jewelry & Loan a pawn shop, would belittle the boutique and the dedicated hard working staff. I have done both, purchased watches at a very fair price and loaned watches or other pieces in order to have immediate access to cash, if  exceptionally good deal on a watch or  collectors item was needed within hours. They have given me the opportunity to expand my collection at the best interest rates I have ever experienced. Most important is their integrity, they have educated me on pieces I overpaid and gave me advice not to purchase pieces that wouldn't hold value. I have never had a Jewelry or Watch store tell me that if I am buying a certain piece to re-sell at later time for a profit, not to do so, unless I truly liked the piece for myself and would keep it in my collection. Some of the Fancy Jewelry Stores in Beverly Hills that sell pre-owned refurbished watches or even new ones, should spend a day at Yev's to learn hospitality, service and most of all integrity.

Yev is the man ! I pawned my AP, mind you this is the first time I was in a jam like this. As I was walking out of the first pawnshop scratching my head thinking why they don't take this type of watch. In my home country they are very sought after. Long story short pawn shops in Los Angele's only take Rolex and Audemars Piguet is a brand they look at like it's something that fell of a space ship. Thankfully I found Yev's Jewelry on Google and the rest went like this "Cha-Ching". I some cash and paid my bills. Thank You Yev and staff you guys are good people.  I will be back soon to pick her up ))</Text>

< review>
I was at this location today to purchase a cake for a birthday. I though all NBC where the same. I though wrong. I purchased a 8" cake and got at best a 6.5" cake, see pictures. I called them out on it and they denied everything saying "we all use the same pans" highly doubt it. This is robbery at its finest. You need tk make this right not only for me but all the clients you've stolen from. I need something done about this.</review>

It's rare to find cakes that truly have that "wow" factor for me. Nothing Bundt Cakes, specializes in having that "wow" factor for me in terms of cakes. Not only are their flavors wide in variety and delicious, but their designs are also very pleasing to see and EAT! I got a gluten free chocolate chip, and OH MY LAWD, it was ADDICTING! I could probably eat an entire 8 inch version all by myself! It's soft, not too sweet, and delicious in every bite. I really really like Nothing Bundt Cakes and I REALLY REALLY hope they are able to open a location in LA soon!!</review>

<Review>Love the Bundt cakes (5 stars all day!), absolutely no complaints. However, when I come in, pay for some cakes, and then go walk around for 20 minutes while the cake is being prepared, I expect that when I return 45 minutes later that the order will be ready to go. Instead, you clearly forgot, and instead of trying to make things right and apologize for your mistake you tell me it will just be 5 more minutes to put the icing on the cake. Which then took an extra 15 minutes anyways.

Once again, I love your cakes but please take care of your customers. Especially if you clearly forgot the order and are in the wrong.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

When I placed it in my mouth, I experienced being transported back to 1975,in my mom's kitchen eating my mom's cake. I remember a tears boiling up in my eyes as I ate that bite-size of bliss. I walked away with a pecan-praline cake. OMG! I have to watch my weight while my foot is broken, but when I can walk better, I'll definitely be back in the shop picking up goodies.</Text>< Resp>

Deliciousness!!! Fresh and moist cakes with a pretty good selection. They offer samples and have monthly flavors. Perfect for special occasions or just a sweet tooth. Parking is in the shared lot behind the stores but they validate, so it’s a very short walk. Being right on Ventura it’s very convenient<//text>

The bundtlets are out of this world delicious. I personally recommend the lemon or the white chocolate raspberry varieties. They are delicious.<//review>< time>

The Service: Staff is friendly and gives good recommendation of their best seller.

The Cake: OMG! Super moist!! I chose White Chocolate Raspberry. The cake is not too sweet.  However, the icing is a little too sweet for me. But overall, great size dessert for one!!

Really cute, trendy bakery.  The special edition Lemon Raspberry bundt cake is special indeed "so moist & delicious!" The flavors compliment each other with their smooth, heavenly cream cheese frosting whipped just right: -).......You simply can't just try one.< /review>

<Review>Very disappointed I'm a part of a nonprofit organization who reached out for an in-kind donation for over a week I was never able to get a hold of the owner, our email was never answered. the manager was very short with me over the phone like it was no big deal she said we're too busy to deal with this today were her words. It seems like there's a lack of communication within your store when it comes to things like this. I highly suggest you put together a team that deals with donations etc. in a more professional manner

Love the cakes, poor customer service<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I always get a variety when I go so I can have a little bit of everything. Idk what it is about this place but their cakes are always moist and have the perfect ratio of cake to icing.< /Review><Date>1449169040045< /Date><username>Christopher Abbott<//username>< pics>

Signed up for the birthday club, never got a birthday club email. Superstar manager would not honor the free Bundt Cake but said I can try again next year. For the amount I spend on special occasions annually at this place, I am very disappointed. Will not be back.< /text>

<text>I came here yesterday to pick up a dozen individuals for my mom who placed an order! It's so good!!! I've never like bundt cake . I always felt like they were dry and a little boring but yesterday when I ate these I was blown away!! I had the lemon flavor and it was so good & so moist! My fiancé had the chocolate and his was very moist as well! I recommend you checking it out . The only reason I gave it four stars is because some of them were not placed well in the bundt cake holders and were tossed but still edible no one was upset . I will come back for sure !<//text></record>

< review>
monstrosity of a nail salon, is unorganized and totally unprofessional.  This was their second chance  from me and they horribly failed once again.  I booked an appointment before and they had me wait 45 minutes AFTER my set and booked appointment time block to even get me started. This time was the same occurrence but this time they were going to make me wait close to 1 HOUR after my set appointment time! This place needs to get ORGANIZED ASAP.  Do not even try setting an appointment here. I happily booked an apt at crown royal nails on ALLEN ROAD and they have yet to dissapointed me :)
May you all not have the same unnecessary experience that I had.< /review>

My dad and I come at least twice a month and everyone is so friendly. I love the costumer service I’m never disappointed in my nails. They also do great eyebrow waxing. I 100% recommend. I’ve been coming to this place for a few years now and have not once been disappointed with the service.<//Text>

I love this salon!  Linda is my favorite and does an excellent job on my tootsies...EVERYTIME.  She has a gentle touch, is very thorough in removing all dead skin, and gives a perfect calf massage.

I highly recommend Princess Nails & Spa so much that even though I've moved to Highland Knolls, it's still worth the trip.<//review>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>I got a set of acrylics and the nail tech was very very rude. On multiple occasions she would yell to her co workers and it was very annoying. I didnt appreciate her attitude neither. She kept shaking her head and acting annoyed because the hand rest kept moving. If she did not want it to move get it screwed in
Or glued down. Beside that it was good. If you go i recommend the male nail tech. He was very nice,  patient and overall very good at nails.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I went in for a manicure and pedicure. The lady that “greeted” us looked very angry and was not very friendly but because I was using a gift certificate I had to stay. A different woman gave me my pedicure. During the pedicure I could not relax because she kept digging deep into the side of my toe. After many pedicures where this usually feels great, this time was very painful. I just couldn’t wait to get it over with until the leg massage began which I did enjoy! I then had my manicure which also was nice. When I left, my toe was sore but I thought it would feel better later. The next day not only did my manicure begin to peel but my toe was swollen. I have never had an ingrown toenail but I think I may have one now. Two days later I have absolutely no paint on my fingernails and my toe is swollen and oozing. I think she cut my toenail and tried to dig out the rest but couldn’t get ahold of it so she just left it or she cut my skin that has now caused an infection. Either way it has caused my toe to swell and I now have to go to the doctor. There are plenty of shops like this around town! I suggest choosing a different one.</Review><Rating>1<//Rating><gmapID>0x80ea4485d96e1eb7:0xccf795f53febf4e0< /gmapID><name>Christy< /name></record>

I went in for an acrylic set and Lynn didnt listen to me and decided a dip powder set was better for me. I was already unhappy with what i was getting. She didnt fill my whole nail and blamed me when she never did it right to begin with. She fricken burned me multiple times with the filet and then wouldn't fix her mistakes. I have to go to another salon to get them fixed. I'm never going back.<//text>

<review>The most relaxing and thorough pedicure that I've ever had. Almost fell asleep several times.

Only negative is how busy they are. Expect a decent wait. Worth it tho.</review><gmap_id>0x80ea4485d96e1eb7:0xccf795f53febf4e0</gmap_id>< Pics>

I got my eyebrows waxed here, nothing fancy but it seemed clean. The woman was very nice but also pretty rough, she pushed my head back and forth and gave me a quick coarse face massage at the end. But my eyebrows turned out very well (which I am really picky about), so I would go back.</Review>

It literall felt like i was a being tortured by the woman who did my pedicure.  She kept cutting into my skin and after I told her three times that she was hurting me and telling her to stop she finally moved on.  I have a big cut on my toe (from her) and can't wear closed toed shoes.  None of my toenails/fingernails are uniform in length.  Some are short, some are SUPER SHORT.  I won't be going back her except to show the manager what was done to my toe.</text>

Terrible service. Waited 30 minutes and was next in line as a drop-in when one of the techs let some woman jump the line. She even looked over at us when she let the woman cut the line. I left fuming. Do NOT come here.</Text>

Great dog park. It has a big designated off leash dog area. I take my dog here almost every day and he enjoys it. There is plenty of space to toss a ball around and lots of trees and bushes for him to sniff.< /review>

Beautiful park here in Ojai with clean bathrooms and hand soap, pet area, playgrounds, pavilion for parties, seats, benches and sink/wash area.
Lots of grown trees for shade, plenty of parking, the sun setting over the mountains offers a beautiful sight to enjoy in the afternoon.< /text>

Park is OK but out of town and usually empty. There was a ranger there today labor day who wanted $4 to park and use the dog park for 1/2 hour. Nice waste of money but a great way to get time and a half holiday pay plus pension.< /text>

Dogs are only allowed in the dog park. You can get a citation for having your dog in the actual park. Other than that the park is beautiful and the dog park is shaded for the most part.</review>

Best park in ojai for sure. OJAI HORSE SHOE CREW IS THE GREATEST!!! Park Rangers are very rude though, I didn't have change for a $20, and Instead of helping me break the $20 to pay for parking they just told me too bad, and proceeded to write me a ticket... on a different occasion and older women blocked my car while I was drooping off a friend, and threatened to write me a ticket even though I had only been there for 5 mins, and was about to leave< /text>

< review>
The George, just might make me move from Chicago. I loved every aspect of this place. Came here for the weekend and my friends who live on the first floor housed me. I fell in love with the layout of the condo. Great space for them. 1 bed 1 bath + patio at a reasonable price. With everything being so new I loved the feel and the atmosphere. It is a great place to live, network, play and enjoy life. What creates such a great vibe is the rooftop. The pool is about the right size for a rooftop pool. The large hot tub is amazing, along side there is a small wadding pool/kids pool. There are chairs and beach beds for many people. The center of the pool area is the extremely large tv in the center. There is a party room that holds a pool table, ping pong table, foosball table, a very large dinner table, kitchen with a stove and fridge, large couches to hold at least 12 people. There is also an outdoor patio where there is a pour your own beer area. It has a great high end feel while it keeps things simple but elegant. The George is a lifestyle. One you will be very happy to live. I highly recommend this to be your place of living. Reach out to Laura for more information!< /review>

All the staff is super nice, but Garrett has been one of the best leasing agent that I’ve dealt with. He helped me and my boyfriend at the Marke and now here at the George. We love it here so much already. Our B1 floor plan is awesome! We especially love the kitchen space!<//Text>

Thank you Paul! Over this last  weekend our AC went out due to it being so hot. I could not bear the heat after one night with it out and on a Sunday after hours I called for the AC unit to be fixed. While I was on the phone I also requested some maintenance to be done to my guest bathroom as the shower was clogged. I never heard anything back about the AC but almost immediately I received a call from Paul in maintenance about my shower. Within the hour Paul showed up with the greatest attitude and fixed the shower right away. I explained to him that our AC unit was out and he said no problem and went to work fixing it. Immediately he went to his truck and got us a portable AC unit while he worked. In a timely fashion Paul found the issue and fixed it. Our AC is now working perfect in fact even better than before and we have Paul to thank for everything. Paul is an outstanding guy and deserves a raise for the extra effort he put in when he did not have to. I am glad we had Paul in our corner as not having AC was a literal hell! Thank you so much Paul from Tyler and Yaz.</text>

Toured with Garrett who showed us all the amazing amenities and about a dozen floorplans. He was very knowledgeable and patient, answering the million questions I had with accurate information and the kindness to put my mind at ease, we ended up signing up and cant wait to move in! Great location, easy parking, and super cool staff. Janine and Courtney were also very sweet and helpful!< /Review>

My experience at the George, has been great. The leasing agent Sara was very professiinal, knowledgeable, thorough, and couteous. I had some small issues to overcome before getting moved in. Sara was patient and understanding in assisting me in getting through them. I was very pleased with the total process and now that I'm moved in to my apt. The experience has continued to impress!</Review>

Needed an apartment ASAP and the George had one left at a great rate. Complex is clean with vaulted ceilings, two open courtyards, and tasteful design elements. Customer service is prompt and helpful (Thanks Nicole!), and maintenance handled a request two days into our move-in. So far so good! Highly recommended. -Anna< /review>

<Text>Worst apartment experience, I am so happy to be out of the George. It has been nothing but headaches and improper management. To start, this place is absolutely UNSAFE. For the nine months we stayed about 4-5 cars were broken into and 1 was someone that we knew. Before, there were no security outside the building until several cars got broken into and one of them all wheels were stolen. Even with security outside still recently vehicles were broke into.

I would NOT recommend this place to anyone who cares about their safely. The leasing office's solution to this was to tell the tenants to get rid of any valuables in the car. Are you serious?! How about what YOUR plans to help us stay safe. I was extremely cautious walking to my apartment at night. I felt very unsafe in the parking structure, this is not something that should be ok, especially for the dues we pay as good tenants.

This apartment is supposed to be smoke-free but that is not true! Just wait until everyone is off of work, you can smell the weed through the windows and in the hallways. It is extremely annoying getting the strong smell in most of the hallways, people do not respect the rules.

Yes, the rooftop is beautiful, but why is it that the couple of times we have gone up there, there's always someone trying to offer us drugs... One time during my family gathering, someone had the nerve to invite us back to their place for strippers and drugs in front of my adult family members. The George does not run full background checks on any of their tenants, which explains why situations like these happen.

My boyfriend and I have been woken up 6-8 times between 2-4am because of the surrounding tenants playing extremely loud music causing the walls to shake. The music was so loud that night, my boyfriend furiously went downstairs to look for security around 4:30am to seek help. Keep in mind we are working people, we could not go back to sleep causing extreme exhaustion the next day at work. Security all they do is knock and tell them to shut the music off. Yes, the manager might follow up the next day, however, going back to where the The George not doing fully background checks. Some of these tenants main purpose might be to move in for a few months and then leave.

Not only is The George unsafe but all their chains are worse! We asked to moved back to the Marke, but the manager offered us Nineteen01. We do a lot of research before opening our mouth or seeking for help. We heard someone got shot few months ago from a bad drug deal. Please do not let the positive Yelp comments foul you, the George encourages tenants to post yelp comments, then offer an incentive for doing so. Do not lease at Nineteen01 or The George</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBrPLBYsUiPZ5ySQqGrSbZw3jhs0Gib7xVbx7x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMD97GCp2grDVjay62gB4u1zBiUB-i0b6qc3T08=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNl7TR5COBIqWK4n2slyKA3kRbB_CzCEMerJah6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<date>1567192869173< /date><Text>Lidia Cabana is an exceptional agent. The George is a fabulous place to live! I was so impressed by the beautiful meditation garden, the pool area with the beer garden and oversized TV. All of the small lounge areas with free WiFi and conference room is a huge benefit to students and business owners like myself. I loved the modern contemporary decor and all of the amenities. All of the apartments come with a storage space at no additional cost. I lived at the apartment complex across the street-Gateway, and the George is better! More amenities like more lounges with tables and space and wifi. The vibe is a lot more young professional, versus Gateway is more family oriented. I want to give my compliments to Lidia for going above and beyond showing me multiple options, all of the amenities and having an apartment immediately available with a very smooth transition! The location, the views, the property grounds are amazing and very adequate of a luxury apartment! I recommend this place to young, single, students and professionals in the area! They even have a very cool convenience store that allows you to access essentials like toilet paper and food items 24/7 without leaving your apartment complex! You can have business meeting, do your homework, exercise, live and watch the games and party all in the same place! Seems all great to me !<//Text><user>118104975566677211759</user><response>None< /response><pics>None<//pics><rate>5<//rate>< username>

Honestly a very nice apartment complex. I am sharing a two bedroom with a few roommates which there is plenty of room and very nice apartment. And thank you for responding to my original complaints. I appreciate the concern. I still am not receiving texts or emails about packages when I receive them though. I will update this if it fixes. The Satff is very nice and understanding.<//Review>

<Review>All I can say is WOW! This place gets 5 stars in my book! From the landscape, to the decor to the friendliness of the staff, I was truly impressed. Laura Kaufman was the leasing agent that showed us around. She was extremely competent, professional and addressed all our questions with ease. This place is the ultimate in luxury!< /Review>< user>

I looked at the surrounding apartment complexes, & The George by far is the best. The staff is amazing, the amenities are great, & the gym and rooftop pool & beer gardens are one of a kind. They always have really cool events for the residences (ex:movie night on the rooftop -they have a 16ft tv). I definitely recommend The George.< /Text>

Moving is always so stressful but Claire made it so much easier!! She took me on a tour of multiple apartments just so I could pick exactly what floor plan and view I wanted while I live here. I’m so excited to move in this weekend and start enjoying all of the wonderful amenities this building has... Thanks Claire!!!!<//review>

If I could give this place NO stars I would,

My mother and I are a resident here, and we decided to break our lease in November after our car along with 11 others got broken into,

The first time of the lease termination, it was done incorrectly as they wanted to keep a Security Deposit 10 dollars short of $10,000.

So we have been waiting the SECOND  time to be served, OCSD came in the unit without identifying themselves, came in with guns and force, searched EVERY NOOK AND CRANNY, said paperwork was mailed out, Was not mailed out to said P.O Box, also claimed it was posted before on the door, it was not.

Also took the key fob off of my key set without my permission therefore committing theft of private property.

I will HIGHLY recommend people to consider either moving of your a resident, or dont consider if you are not.

WORST experience in my life.

Dont come here.<//review>

<pictures>None</pictures><Review>The George doesn't really check pay stubs/bank statements for employment or legal career.The George accepts any application to fill vacant apartments, 2-3 people around my apartment got evicted and we came across eviction notices on  doors on different floors when walking around the complex. People living here will be your worst nightmare because of the late night partying.
We were woken up several times by neighbors playing loud music between 1-4am, (neighbors wouldn't answer the door when security knocked and did not stop until much later)
People have broken windows to get into cars even with all the security they hired. Tires were stolen from a vehicle, people offering drugs at roof top, lack of team efforts from the George, not showing up on time for repairs in my apartment, and cops showing up almost every other week.  Lack of security at the roof top and drunk  people acting stupid on our first week of moving in. Fights during the roof top parties, and undercover cops arresting (illegal business) residents living at the George .
You can hear noise from events at the angel stadium, drifting cars in the angel stadium parking with loud noises coming through our windows, a lot of traffic from the freeway, and hundreds of exiting cars through the angels stadium games making it hard to enter the George.I witnessed drunk people sleeping outside in their cars in front of the George.
After several incidents I communicated with the management (and his team) and all they kept saying was " financially, financially, finically we cannot help". They don't focus in customer service. All they care is about financially stabilizing their business even though we had a good history living at the Marke for over 14 months and 9 months at the George.
If you want to take a risk and lease here try to get an agreement at least for 2-3 months probation, if you are not happy you can move out.
My family and I, moved out even though Financially it was expensive to move out and move in into a new place.  We CARE ABOUT OUR SAFETY, PEACE, AND ENJOYMENT and it was worth the move.
My friends who lived at Nineteen01 (part of Lyon homes, The George), Said a few months ago a tenant got shot from a drug deal that didn't go well (Again the George and Lyon properties don't verify employment so some people might be living here at the George as well). I heard Jennifer Simon was able to help some of my friends or neighbors more than the inside manager was offering at the location. After seeking help, I did not hear from her. When she communicated back to me I was able to tell she didn't take the time to read my email, didn't  really know what was going on based on questions I asked her. Jennifer Simons stated she was going to do research and get back to me. She never did and after following up and leaving a voice message I had Luis the general manager from LYON homes follow up with me. Within a few minutes over the phone his answer was no, what I requested was fair. All I kept hearing was financially, financially, financially from the manager, Jennifer Simons and Luis.
All they care about is the finance part of it but never customer service or to help us. Since the first week we had issues at this location. My recommendation to the manager, Lyon and management, Don't focus too much in the finance part and taking every cent from tenants pockets. Focus in customer service, offer help and solutions to make it equal or offer more  options to tenants going through hard times while living here, more security, lease application training, interviews,  neighbors, location safety, tighten policy more straighten.  Have more stringent lease application approvals, verify income and employments
The George needs to create a safer environment, hired more maintenance staff to help with on time repairs, security patrolling 24/7 going up and down the whole parking structure plus the outside of the building. Roof top: hire more staff to help with towels, TV channels, security for parties. Don't tolerate drunk people outside sleeping in their vehicles.</Review><time>1551821850032<//time>< Resp>

Perfect combination of great food and service. The owner is super!!! A lot of repeat customers and she knows all of them by name. I was impressed myself when I came back a few days later and she said ‘You came back, nice to see you’!!!  Food is delicious, price is reasonable, and portions are plentiful😊.< /text>

Mint's is always fresh and delicious. We have visited many times over the last 11 years and it has been tasty every time. They did catering at an event about 8 years ago and the food and service was delightful there also. The owners always remember us and greet us when we come in.< /Text>

I’ve never left a restraint review before but the food was so good I felt I simply had to leave a review. The shaken beef and sesame chicken was so good I wish I had infinite stomach capacity, because I would still be eating if not for that. I definitely recommend anyone even remotely thinking about coming here to try it out.

Side note: My parents really liked the wine list because I’m writing this in a Uber.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I cannot understand why this Vietnamese restaurant is not packed every night. We have been coming to this place for years and have never been disappointed with the food. Their rolls are all stellar particularly the scorpion role, the golden crispy roll is outstanding and this is the best banh xeo I've had anywhere including multiple times in Vietnam. For some reason they don't have it listed on their online menu and they call it Vietnamese pancake I believe. People in Sacramento need to support restaurants like this especially given the difficult times they've had throughout the pandemic. Come on folks. Get in here and enjoy some great Vietnamese food.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x809add6c31993b9b:0x264f170ed5c1d124< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>The food is great and a different twist on Asian food with a European flare. Straight 5 stars on the food alone. However, smaller portion size for being family style and higher on the price side, not a great combo! Serving staff is not bad, seems friendly enough stretched thin and a little slow on the refills.<//review><Name>Soren</Name></record></dataset><record>

Very delicious! Definitely a wonderful first impression, food smelt fresh and looked amazing! They got my order correct to the tee and even had the boxes labeled as the dish you ordered for no confusion. The lady was sweet and simple, fast service and excellent customer service.</Review>

The owners (Mr. & Mrs) are such a lovely and lively pair. I have dined at Mints for years and even had a bday celebration here (pre-Covid). They have always been so accommodating, especially during my early Uni. days and career pursuit, when I would sit in the back hall of the restaurant (where it was less crowded) and study for grueling exams and/or complete assignments. :)

Mints will always be home to my family and me. The yummy food, ambience, and very hospitable staff are always a reason to keep coming back.<//Text>

<Review>I love Mints. It's one of my favorite places to go to lunch. I treat myself to a trip here quite a bit. Been exploring the menu lately and love everything on it. Shaking beef is still my favorite but it's worth trying everything. So tasty. Great service too.< /Review></record>

This place is my favorite. I eat in a lot of restaurants but to this one I keep coming back again and again. The stuff is very cordial and the food they offer is so flavorful. I never miss an opportunity to have a nice dinner here. I recommend this place with pleasure.</text>

<Review>This is our favorite restaurant of all time. Food and ambiance are wonderful. Michelle, especially, is such a hard worker, making sure everyone is happy and satisfied. Daniel also makes sure all is perfect. All the servers are great!  I especially like the guy who serves at lunchtime, named Alex (cute guy!). We thank the Mints staff for the many years of tasty dinners and delightful gatherings with family and friends.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>This is by far the best in class for Asian cuisine!!! I have been bringing my wife here for years ... The quality of the food is superb! They have dishes in the 11 buck range up to 23 for pan seared salmon... Though it's farmed... Would give 4.5 Stars for that reason..   but otherwise the dishes are fabulous! The tia ice tea 😍 has edible flower decorating it...<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Just had dinner there - absolutely wonderful. Great ambience, upscale little place. The food is superb - menu is quite diverse, with a blend of Vietnamese and some Thai cuisine. The Vietnamese Spring Roles were delicate and delicious, and the Sesame Chicken was probably the best I’ve ever had - very delicate crust, crispy, and light. The portions are good sized and shareable, and very affordable. Very good service as well.<//Text></record>

<review>Spent the night in Rancho Cordova visiting family and found this gem of a restaurant near our hotel. The owners work in the restaurant. They had a nice wine list and the owner joined us for a glass!

Had the sesame chicken, shaken beef and steak. Left full and happy. Food was very reasonably priced for the quality of the meal. Definitely will make a reason to visit here again.< /review><gmapID>0x809add6c31993b9b:0x264f170ed5c1d124<//gmapID><rate>5</rate><UserId.>116703984907306770555< /UserId.></record>

Personalized? Really? I was making the person on the phone aware that I would not like all of the vegetables they typically include in a dish I desired and she said “well if you don’t like it you can go somewhere else.” I then expressed that typically a restaurant wants to keep customers and eliminating an item from a dish for the sake of the customer is just good customer service. She then said “Oh well” and laughed repeatedly.  I called back to get the persons name so I could make their management aware and the clerk said “That is the manager and her name is Michelle”. With this attitude - what else is really going on at this establishment? I don’t want to find out!  Plenty Thai restaurants around now. The system forced me to put a star but my intention was zero stars.<//Text>

<Review>Rarely I leave a review after one visit, however this place is exceptional. The service is warm and the dining area is comfortable and calm. The food is meticulously prepared and so delicious it will be quite memorable. I had the Vietnamese rolls to start. They are served in a nice display and the taste is  top notch! I love Vietnamese food and found this to be one of the best rolls I've ever had. I would eat the peanut sauce on everything everyday if it were so possible! My entree is grilled pork with stir fried spinach, onion , cherry tomato side. You can taste the grill in the pork and the onions in a very good way. The spice level is perfect...enough to where you know it's there but not so much that it burns. It was such a perfect blend of flavor. If I lived nearby I'd eat here minimum weekly! The only recommendation is boost your wine list offerings. They have three reds and they are priced well at $6-8 per glass. They are good and no complaints, however I would love a top shelf glass of red to go with the wonderfully spiced food!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x809add6c31993b9b:0x264f170ed5c1d124<//Gmap_id><rating>5</rating><name>nik s</name><UserId.>116800786319868543838<//UserId.>< response>

This classy restaurant has been in Rancho Cordova for a long time but we just found out about it. We had lunch and were blown away. The food is not your typical Chinese cuisine, but an upscale, delightful use of familiar dishes with a twist. I am picky but I was beyond impressed. Prices are very reasonable and service was exceptional. I highly recommend this incredible restaurant.< /review>

The spring rolls were very good, but the staff needs some training. I waited at least 5 minutes before even being acknowledged. The lunch rush had just left, so there was no reason for the poor reception. Two waiters were less than six feet away at the bar's computer, but didn't say anything. Maybe I'll return, but only for takeout.</text>

Spicy & Sour Shrimp Soup was divine. Sweet from pineapple but spicy build up from jalepeno yet no over-burn if you just stir the peppers in the soup but not eat them (unless you want that level of heat.) Shrimp was clean, nice mix of veggies. Would have gave 5 stars of they had used fresh pineapple but was still yummy. Very nice atmosphere compared to many nearby restaurants and still good quality after being in business for so long.</text>< Pictures>

This place was awesome! Really great food, and wonderful service! Don't be deceived by the outside, pleasantly surprised by the ambiance inside. Owners work there and you can tell they really care about their guests experience. The chow mien, spinach side dish and everything else was delicious! We all left with a happy tummy.<//Text>

I'm from Boston and was in town for business.  I saw that the reviews were good for Mints, but I wasn't expecting much, perhaps it was my urban snobbery.  Well, I was blown away!  It was by far one of the best Asian meals I have ever had.  The ahi tuna spring rolls were fresh, tasty and generous.  The Mongolian beef was flavorful and resting on crunchy noodles that soaked up the delicious sauce.  You won't be disappointed!<//review>

Absolutely incredible.  In town for business, and this is the best place I have ever eaten in years of business travel.  I don't understand why they aren't packed with a line out the door.  The menu is so carefully considered, and every dish was perfectly executed.  I will come here every time I come to Rancho.<//text>

I stopped in there tonight with a friend for the first time because the reviews looked great and we were starving. They brought out the wrong rolls and stuck is with it claiming we ordered incorrectly.  When our main dishes were served mine had a hair in it, or rather “an eyelash” according to the owner. It’s all the same right? Pubes, eye lashes, whatever falls off another humans body into your bowl it’s all good.
The worst part is it’s been an hour and my stomach has been upset and I’m sweating profusely.
I refused to pay, but my friend picked up the tab.
I’ll never return, even if the crispy rolls are the best.<//review>

Decent restaurant in Rancho Cordova. Try the crispy golden appetizer rolls, they are delicious and a nice portion size. I like the tiger prawns and the salmon w garlic noodles. Atmosphere is ok, service is decent, and wine list could be better...but overall, very happy to have them near my office.</Text>

Everything was clean including the hardbound menu. The only knock I had is that the price point was a little high, but in the end the experience justified the cost.< /Review>< pictures>

Incredible hidden jewel! Everything was perfectly tasteful and well thought out. Follow the recommendation of the wait staff, they will not lead you astray.

Try the spring rolls, I would definitely recommend them as a starter.< /Text>

This is a fabulous little restaurant. The server is one of the kindest women I've ever met, the food is top notch,  and the service is excellent!  Add far as price goes,  it's bit exactly cheap. ..but it's totally worth it.<//Review>

The food was ok but nothing special. I ordered a spicy dish but of course they added no spice.  After asking for hot sauce it was a little better. The really strange part was when I ordered, she asked if I wanted rice with it. This dish is a dish eaten with rice, so yeah! Please give me rice.  I was charged $1.00 for the rice! WTF!          The dish should have been veggies stir fried with chicken. It was chicken stir fried with a tiny bit of veggies. I do not recomend this place.</text>

We love to dine here. Our goal is to try everything on the menu and we have not been disappointed. It is our favorite restaurant in Rancho Cordova. But a side note----Thank you for your support to our wrestling team at Cordova High. Mint's donated new uniforms for our under looked team. Our Sons were on that team many years ago and I know they will appreciate what you have done for their old alma mater. Great Food and great Sportsmanship!!< /Review>

<Text>To say the quality was top notch is just scratching the surface. They completed my replacement with kindness, efficiency and with bonus laughs. These guys keep it glassy all day long. 10/10 would use again if an impromptu rock crosses my path on the freeway. Highly recommend.

They even helped me load the old windshield in my backseat to take home for my stained glass projects.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

It was just before the Fourth of July holiday and my driver side window wasn’t working. I was in a predicament, considering I had plans for the long weekend. They were the only company available, ready and willing to help me in my time of need. They were kind, professional and very efficient.  They came to my work and quickly finished the job within 20 minutes!  Many thanks to Nick & crew for making my 2021 much-needed-holiday possible- they are A+!< /review>

<text>$949 for a windshield?  Shame on me for not asking for a quote beforehand.  Sloppy work.  Large gaps in the upper molding.  Antenna grommet destroyed.  Install guy blamed issues on everything but himself.  Called the manager.  The guy who did the install is apparently the manager.  Told me I was lucky I found someone willing to replace such a tricky windshield.  Worst experience ever.

To address the manager/owner's comments...  If the attached photos look like solid workmanship, your standard is in the basement.  I expressed my concerns to you after you completed the work, and again when I called to talk to the manager (which turned out to be you).  I got nowhere.  I gave you and your employee a tip for making the trip up from El Cajon.  At the time, I didn't fully appreciate the shoddiness of the work or that you were the owner/manager.  You cannot fix this because, as you know, I shipped my vehicle overseas the following day.  I will never do business with you again.  Goodbye.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>
{'time': 1625188230344, 'text': 'I remember checking this out with you after the job was completed and when we left you were a happy customer that gave us a $40 tip. We discussed why the price was higher than usual. The top and side molding were replaced. All the clips were broken and we replaced them. The rubber for the antenna was ripped prior and we showed you that before we replaced it. If you are concerned with the job please reach out and we will discuss it.'}</Response>

<review>First time ever getting my windshield replaced. Over all the experience was excellent.
I ended up getting there 20 minutes early. While I waited I accidentally locked my keys in my car. When they got here  the windshield guy (Nick) called up another local place and had a guy come down to get my keys out. Neither of them charged me for that. When they started on my windshield they had told me that I was missing some molding from the top part of the windshield. They put new molding in there also free of charge. I had also brought some new windshield wipers that they installed also free of charge. After they finished they told me all the stuff about upkeep and I was on my way. The whole replacing process took around 15-20 minutes.
Safelight was going to charge me around 670$ but this place did it for 230$. Definitely coming back for furthers repairs.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>I had a hidden crack that expanded quickly on my 2019 Honda CRV. After getting quotes at other places, it was Nick who gave me a straight answer and great price. Nick and Frank came when they said they would and replaced my windshield quickly and professionally. Overall great experience, hassle-free, and great quality. Definitely calling them first for any future issues.</Text>< Time>

I highly recommend Chief Auto Glass. I had a crack in my windshield and was pleasantly surprised that they were able to come to my house for the repair and offered me a great price to boot. No hidden fees, what he quoted me was what I paid. Very knowledgeable and was able to answer all of my questions. Nick went the extra mile to make sure I was satisfied with the work. His customer service and skill are top notch! Thanks again Nick for a job well done!</review>

I had what I believed was a broken driver’s side window (the whole window fell down inside the door). Nadir and Frank responded the next morning and immediately diagnosed the actual problem (broken cable, not a broken window). They were able to quickly and locally source the needed part and still get the repair done during the same visit. They were efficient, friendly and knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend!<//review>

<Review>After having a bad experience at another local glass shop over the course of 2 days, I decided to search for another glass shop that was a little closer to me in El Cajon. I am so glad I stumbled across Chief Auto Glass and I saw they had amazing reviews with customers. I called them late in the day, they took my call and were very helpful and said that they could get the glass ordered and delivered that night and would be able to install it first thing in the next morning.

These guys are the real deal: excellent craftsmen and proud of the work that they do. You can see that they take pride and every installation. They use the best aftermarket glass (Pilkington not fuyao), and they're both certified glass installers by Dow Automotive.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXXzxbrvqlMWXB2xo1OBLgrBOnxwTJoycpNc-O=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNihiT8KJbJNHg6ZrHhKVKa2z5-sJoMfWytf9vQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7yl-yWh41YEZexDfT7pHOSch08ozxe5H_zm-X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhsJanP2VUQRaMNqL4uZf_ycP_ruCUdHVLdok9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Chief auto was by far the best rate for mobile windshield replacement. the windshield is good quality. They were fast, no joke 15 min. I felt the customer service was empathetic to my situation. They didn't ask for a bunch of personal info, like some other places I called for a quote.  I highly recommend using them.</Text>

They showed up on time, extremely polite, and did an outstanding job very quickly. I will refer Chief Auto Glass to everyone I know. Very pleased with them. Great job guys!!!!!<//Text>

I needed my windshield replaced desperately. They gave me a good price when I called. They came to my house the next day, and in less than an hour after they showed up, I had a new windshield on my car. Very clear communication, they do what they say they will do. You get quality parts, and they don't try to  up-sell anything. Very nice in today's world that wants to up-sell everything. The replacement comes with a warranty, and a free ding repair. I'm hoping I never need either. All in all a great experience.</Text>

The absolute BEST experience. I initially reached out when my car was broken into and my window was shattered to pieces & Nick fixed it right away in the comfort of my own parking spot. I recently had a second repair done due to a crack & it was again a great experience. Nick & Frank are not only professionals who provide quality, detailed work - but they are also both kind people with an excellent sense of humor. I would HIGHLY recommend them to anyone in need of glass repair.< /Text>

I had already called a few places for quotes but speaking to Frank on the phone really solidified my choice. He was clear, friendly and professional.

He explained that my car required an extra step that most guys skip/cheap out on. Only one other business mentioned the same thing. The other places were going to break it and glue it back on, frank explained.

I made an appointment and frank was able to come out the next day. He was even earlier than expected! He and his partner were friendly and fast with their work. I have terrible luck with auto glass and I know I’ll probably be using their services again in the future. Thanks guys!!< /Review>

On sunday somebody broke my window and stole something out of my car. I called Chief Auto Glass around 4pm and I was able to get an appointment next morning at 10am. They called an hour before they arrived, and called when they got here. I had to drive a minute to the lot to meet them and they were very polite and respectful even though they had to wait! Window repair took 20 minutes and they vacuumed up everything! Lowest price I’ve found, and they did a phenomenal job. If you are looking for a quick and affordable window replacement call Chief Auto Glass! I am very happy with their service.</review>

I backed into my storage shed on my property after business hours, completely shattering my back window. I hit Google looking for glass replacement shops and found this little gem right here. Not only was Nick very communicative, but he made me feel warm and welcome via text which is my preferred method of contact. We scheduled the visit, after hours at about 9pm, and he sent someone to me the very next morning! Not only did his representative replace my window in a timely fashion, he practiced safe social distancing the entire time of physical verbal communication,  wore a mask, and was completely professional and friendly. I was even able to pay using debit! I highly recommend Chief Auto Glass to anyone in need of quick, reliable service that beats the competition! Thanks again!<//Text>

Chief Auto Glass responded right away, showed up promptly, and did a great job in a short amount of time.  These people are not only extremely knowledgeable and efficient, but very courteous and friendly as well.  We would call them again in a heartbeat!

<Review>Thank you Chief Auto Glass!

I was shopping around and was quoted a lot of $280-$350 for a lot of windshield replacement.
My windshield had a crack on passenger top side and didn't even notice it until possibly weeks have gone by that I noticed a crack. Measured it and it was longer than a dollar bill so there's no way I can purchase a windshield repair kit and fill in resin in that.

Nick answered and provided me the lowest price and conveniently around my area. A+ for them open on a Saturday!

Repair: Nick came by and provided a good quality I'd say OEM Glass, about identical to my previous windshield. Nick noticed that I needed a new molding on the top and was able to replace it.

Tip for thought: They are mobile and can come to your location.

I'd definitely recommend these guys. Peace Google Heads!</Review>< Response>

<Review>The guys at Chief Auto Glass were very prompt. When the glass was late being delivered to them, they called me and apologized and were only about 40 minutes late. They worked efficiently on the installation and gave me a discount for paying cash. I would recommend them to anyone!<//Review><userid>114146602413361812219< /userid></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Got a decent price, but was waiting over an hour for the repair men. They left broken glass all over my driveway, gave me a bunch of attitude, and took several visits through out the day to finish the job. Gino, and Hussam were the worst. I would've rather paid the next cheapest quote, and had all the work done at once then have to stay home all day with a giant hole in my car. Wouldn't recommend.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1468212796119, 'text': "I'm sorry to hear of this but as the owner of the company I do not recall any of this happening.

< review>
Rosa, said she was site manager, phoned me yesterday and was unbelievably insensitive to my family.

Very sadly, my beloved daughter passed away suddenly.  The entire family is attempting to handle her business as best we can.  My daughter had a storage unit with Public Storage for a couple of years.  Apparently, rates went up recently, but the family did not receive notice, because of so much moving around.  Bottom line, I sent check for amount we had been paying, but it was incorrect.  Rosa called me and I sent another check.  Unfortunately, the second check should have been $9.00, but I made it for $7.00.  With my bad eyesight I mistook the "9" for a "7".

Just so you know.❌</review>

<text>From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a beautiful smile and a pleasant feeling. Rosa was amazing and made my day. Had to rent a storage unit and I was all over the place because what I was going through. However, Rosa made it so easy for me from start to finish and made me feel at easy. You can’t find that feeling everywhere you go. Thank you for having Rosa at that location.</text><Response>None< /Response><user_id>107737497293372437023<//user_id>< Pictures>

<review>We traveled all the way from Fresno to get into our storage. We made it here by 5 PM and they supposedly close at 6 PM. Nobody answered and the door was locked and we tried calling several times. We will have to spend the night and try again tomorrow morning.

<text>I came in looking for information on storage Rosa helped us, she was very helpful and friendly. When we walked in she greeted us with a smile and provided all the information we needed. She went above and beyond trying to help us and offered a variety of boxes along with other supplies that we will definitely be needing. We will be coming back once we're ready to start packing.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Rosa and Francisco were so helpful.  I was referred to this location by Shay, whose location did not have the size available that I needed.  Rosa showed me exactly what size unit I needed, signed me up and I was out the door in less than 30 minutes.  They were so nice and professional.  Highly recommend.<//Review><user_name>Alice Hahn</user_name><date>1604777753739< /date><GmapID>0x80dd35cc02fea3df:0x35798f107f5d2ce1<//GmapID><rating>5<//rating><Pics>None</Pics></record></dataset><record>

I needed to get a storage unit ASAP. I was able to walk in and lock in a storage unit with the help of Rosa Francisco. She made the process fast, smooth, and painless.
It's been about a month since I got the unit and haven't had any problems.< /Review>

Andres is the best! I’ve been storing with public storage for a couple years now and have seldom had any experience close to the A+++ service andres always gives. He is a true gift to the team and needs the recognition he deserves. Andres is always attentive, patient, and always makes sure the customer feels welcome and heard. He is the best there and I will continue to be a customer of public storage as long as he is there to assist me. Thank you Andres!</Review>

Went into this location to ask about pricing and received the best customer service from Francisco. Francisco was very knowledgeable about his units and what will work for my needs. Great security at this property and was very clean. Was able to get a unit and move in all my items the same day. Francisco really took a lot of stress off me. Would recommend this public storage and Francisco to anyone who needs storage.< /Text>

<Review>I was at my unit today and couldn't close my door,  Rosa was driving by on her cart and offered help. She showed me the problem and helped me close my storage properly. This team is always ready to help out. Love to see that someone is always driving around ready to help. Gives me piece of mind knowing my storage is secure and the place is always clean. Came in to make my late payment today, I wasn't feeling good and the staff showed concerned even offered me a bottled water. Now a days with everything going on a lot of people dont bother with you, the staff here is always attentive to their  customers. Thank you</Review>< Resp>

<review>I cannot thank Andres enough for the service he provides when I come there. Andres is always so friendly and sweet mand makes sure that I have all my needs taken care of. Any question I have he can answer and and problem I have he can address. He truly is a star worker and makes my experience at this location something I look forward to rather than a hassle. I hope your manager reads this and sees how much of a talent you are and a serious asset to the team. Many other worker have not given me the same amazing service Andres has and he continues to make my day every time I come.<//review>< response>

Francisco and Rosa really helped me with getting a storage at an affordable price. Once I found out I needed to move out of my house so much stress was on my mind. Didn’t know where I was gonna put all my stuff while I found a new place to live. Stopped by this location and was greeted with warm welcoming smiles. The property was very clean. Stopped by to find out prices and what I needed to get a storage. Francisco took me to see the unit and made sure space was big enough for all my stuff. He gave me all the information I needed and helped me sign my lease. Unit was very clean and ready for me to start moving all my items in. Didn’t know this process was so easy, if I would of known I wouldn’t of stressed so much.</Review>

I had a terrible experience with this facility. Many negative aspects, beware. The place is infested with rats and mice which are inside the storage units (see pics of droppings.) I reported the rodent infestation to the on site agent, who offered to rent me a different storage unit, but told me I would have to pay a transfer fee and move the items on my own! Public  Storage is the largest storage provider in North America with over one BILLION dollars in annual revenue. The CEO earns millions of dollars per year, yet they don't spend any money to maintain these storage units. Take a look at the pics I posted - the rubber seal on the bottom of storage unit doors are badly cracked and worn out, resulting in excess dust gets into the storage unit. The rope you pull to open and close the door is torn and came apart. When I first rented this unit I made a reservation on Public Storage's website at a price of $145 per month. When I got to the facility I was told the cost was $218 per month (exact same size unit.) This was a classic bait and switch. Furthermore, at the time of original rental I was told I must buy the extra insurance at $11 per month. I will never do business with Public Storage in the future.<//Text>

Went into get a storage today and I got helped by Francisco and he was excellent. Rented my storage and purchased a damp check to protect my belongings. Francisco customer service was excellent and the property was very clean. I would recommend to anyone. I came back a couple hours later to store my items and I seen Francisco cleaning the property. Would recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>

Updating my review after I got my storage a couple of months ago. Francisco and Rosa and all the staff here are so nice. When ever they see you on the property no matter what there doing like cleaning around the property they stop to greet you and make sure everything is working out well for you. The property is so big and always so clean. Couldn’t of choose a better location to store my belongings then this one.< /review>

<Text>First time getting a storage unit and I was real skeptical about putting all my precious stuff inside a unit and lock it away. But Francisco and Rosa had all the answers to all my questions. The property was really clean and the units was really clean as well. Jocelyn called me when I made my reservation and was really nice and kind over the phone and answered my questions I had on the phone. I would really recommend this place to anyone. I visited other storage places before choosing this place and because of the service and the cleanliness of the property I went ahead and choose this one.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Rented a 5x5 unit a while ago for $75 a month. After a few months they raised it to $99...
Besides they are not friendly nor competent, they probably have a policy not to help customers - or at least try very hard.
Today is my favorite! They changed the code w/o informing me. I had to go to the office to get it, which wasn't easy because i didn't had the code to get out of the gate.
There was not even a chance that lady was going to move from her chair to bring the new code to me. Great Customer  Service Public Storage!
I will move out of there before my stuff is stolen (happen to my storage neighbor today) or the price is going through the roof.

I hope you guys get more competition so you have to work for the $$$ you are getting from us customers!<//Review>

Francisco and Rosa are very polite and Knowledgeable of there storage and merchandise. They offered me everything I would need to keep my belongs safe and ready to use again once I move back into my house. It was very hard choosing a storage to secure my items. After looking at reviews and many different locations,I stopped by this location to see why they had nothing but good reviews. Francisco and Rosa reassured me, this was the place to store my belongings. The property was very clean and I would recommend this property to anyone.<//review>

After having to move and not ever needing a storage I have to say that my experience with this mess was the easiest part thanks to miss Rosa and a young man Francisco had been very helpful and patient with my hole ordeal I'd have to thanks public storage. Came back in for boxes and with all the renovations going Rosa and Francisco were great even while being in a trailer. They were busy with customers but not once did they seem frustrated or annoyed instead they gave everyone great customer service as usual with a smile. They make every visit worth my stop even when I'm having a bad day. Great job, great team.<//review>

Francisco and Rosa has great customer service. Francisco was very knowledgeable of the storage units and the kind that would best fit our needs. We were offered boxes and tape. We bought the tape and tape gun. Rosa helped us to assemble the tape and tape gun considering we had some difficulty because this was our first tape gun purchase. Thank you Rosa for everything. We appreciate the friendliness and helpfulness of this staff; at this location.Very clean location and great fees for storage spaces.</review>

Been storing here for a while now. I could not have made a better decision on where to keep all my precious belongings. No matter what time of day I come to my storage or come to make a payment I am always helped by a young man named Francisco. He’s always so polite and patient. Every time he sees me or other people he always ask how is the storage working out and to let him know if he can make anything better for them.< /review>

<review>I went to Public Storage asking for Prices and I was helped by the Manager Rosa and She made me feel very welcome. I liked the way she Stood up when I entered the Office and How she gave me all the Information to needed. I loved it so Much that I rented a Storage even when I was asking for Prices. Big Shout out to Her and Her Crew for keeping the Place Clean.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

I visited public storage last week to pick up packing supplies and ask for more information based on what storage size would be best for the amount of things I needed to store and I received amazing service from the property manager Rosa . She was patient with all my questions, polite and answered all my questions with detail so that I would get a better idea of what my best options were in terms of packing supplies and unit sizes. The customer service I received here was great! Highly recommend everyone to come to this location. I don’t need storage just yet but once my escrow closes my husband and I will be returning.< /Review>

Let me tell you all about this place, I’ve been renting here a couple weeks now and the young man and the property manager that are always here are always active and very welcoming. I came in this morning to put some boxes away and they were already at work cleaning the facility. Oscar and Rosa keep up the great job!< /review>

Excellent customer service by Oscar. He was very friendly and helpful. He showed me the space before I rented it and loaned me a hand truck. Nice facility. Some hidden fees I wasn’t expecting lost them a star. Otherwise excellent.<//Review>

<Review>I'm a less than a month old customer and since day one Rosa has been there every step of the way. She's extremely pleasant to deal with, very professional and understanding. It's worth the drive out of my city to store my things at this establishment. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING ROSA!!< /Review><Name>Scott Anderson</Name>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Most of the staff here are Great! They are informed and willing to assist with the most bizzar of situations.
Shay came straight to me, instead of clock in, to make sure customer comes first and stayed with us until ALL issues were addressed and resolved.  I don't think she ever clocked in to work.  Service like that isn't around much any more, refreshing.
Driving up to your units is great! From your vehicle straight in to your units cannot be missed.
The only down side is there hours of operation , they close early 6pm.
I give them high marks</Text><Rate>5< /Rate><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Melissa Wallace</Name></record>

Great Service.  I booked for storage space today and everything went faster and was much easier than I thought.  I spoke with Leslie and Rosa who showed me around the property and gave me all my options.  They really have your best interest in mind and aren't sales people trying to sell you the most expensive unit to rent.  I'm very happy with the service that I received from them.<//Text>

I had such a wonderful experience at this Public Storage location. I've been to other Public Storages, but this one is the best yet. The staff, Leslie, Cesar and Rosa were so kind and helpful. I rented for 6 months, and everything was perfect! Everything was clean, which is a big thing for me. I definitely recommend this Public Storage!< /text>

<review>My girlfriend and I have a unit at this location for almost a year and the staff is excellent.  We are living between friends and family, it's been a difficult year but every time we come to our storage the staff has been very helpful and friendly. They are very understanding of our situation they call and show their concern for us and our things in storage. We've been here to see how other customers talk to them and they still keep a smile. We really appreciate everything Rosa Cali and Juanito do. Thank you very much, we'll be sure to recommend to anyone that needs storage.< /review><name>jenifer castillo</name>< gmapID>

I called ahead of time and explained my situation and needs to the clerk (Leslie). She was very attentive to me and my needs while I was there, which was surprising as people were coming in back to back to make payments. She even had to call her boss to help me in the best way she could and she did it while not skipping a beat! I am not one at all to write reviews but at a time when I felt so overwhelmed it was pleasant to have such understanding and service. Really I appreciate that they will have a customer in me anytime I need storage services.<//review>< Pictures>

The service at this particular location was awesome! I was here at 9:29am, the doors opened at exactly 9:30am.. I was in and out within 15-20 minutes, Leslie and Cesar explained everything so well which made the transaction very smooth for me, especially since I have never done this before, and that's exactly why I gave 5 stars. If anyone needs a storage unit, I will totally recommend this location!!! Awesome staff.< /review>

<Text>It's just a storage space. The staff are very friendly and helpful. My storage unit is always extremely dusty near the door opening on the inside of my unit. Dirt and dust blow in under the door and it is a dusty  mess when I open it.  A few years ago, they had mentioned that they spray the perimeter of the buildings to control undesirable insects. But inside my unit there are often Daddy Long Leg Spiders and one time I was deep in my cluttered unit and when I came out.. There was a thick Black Spider on my pants leg. . When I first rented my unit, they were charging me $189.00 per month plus insurance and other fees they tack on. Each year they raise the rent a significant amount. I've had my storage  unit 5 years and I'm now paying $375.00 per month. Plus fees and insurance, etc. In that same period, I've gotten a total of $0.11 cents pay increase from my job so you can see that my Public Storage Rent is now eating up  up a significant percentage of my monthly income. I really need to clean it out and vacate the unit because I can't keep up with their large annual rental increases. I wish the units were under Rent Control. LOL</Text>< Pictures>

This place is a rip off. They raised my rate every quarter. What started off as a $65 monthly introductory rate became $190 after two years of storage. The place is filthy, especially the bathrooms.</Text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Review>We have been customers of Public Storage for many years and recently we needed to downsize our storage space.

Leslie & Rosa the Public Storage girls helped us with the move allocating a space across from the old one. They also made all the paper work easy for the new space. We had been dreading the move but Leslie gave us all the good advise. Thank you girls.</Review><username>John Mascola< /username>< GmapID>

<Text>I just moved from Vegas and needed somewhere to put my furniture. I arrived at the office and was geared my Rosa and Nieshia they were very friendly and helpful. I had a storage reserved but was very small. Rosa was very helpful showed up the next bigger one and was somewhat big. I wasn't sure on the price she offered look around for other stores but by this time I was already frustrated. I left and was very unhappy with the service i was offered at Extra Space do I came back and rented with Rosa and Nieshia they made this move easy for us. Thank you ladies.<//Text>< Response>

Public storage is your average storage place i'd say they are better conpared to other  places. Prices are good for the first 6 month-1 year, i always use them when i need to store something never had any issues place is clean and pretty decent prices</text>

Rosa, Shawnae, Juanito great service. We only had a few minutes to get storage move in and get to the gray hound bus. They were great they got us taken care of right away, they worked together as a team. They were busy with other customers and were still able to help us get out in less then 30 minutes. The location was very clean and they were very friendly and helpful. Best experience so far and made our day easier after the rental.</Text>

Shay was such a help. Showed me around, and was so patient while I decided on what size storage I wanted. And she even explained about insurance. Such a joy to work with.< /Review>

Sitting outside waiting to make a police report as I wait on the manager to get here. They changed my unit locks... removing both and replaced them without giving me notice. They won’t open the unit and are asking me to purchase a new lock AND pay them to remove the locks they put on!!!</Text>

Antwone was very helpful throughout the process of acquiring a unit. Thank you!

Edit: Every month that I've gone to my storage unit, Juanito and Rosa were always professional, kind, and helpful. Thank you for all of your help and being amazing people!< /Text>

<Review>I have to say that it's weird for me to review a public storage but the service I got was so great that it motivated me to to it.

Leslie, Cesar and Rosa went the extra mile for me.  I only use storage to store Jeep Top during summer time.  Of course I lost my key, needed receipts printed, had 1 day to get my top out... all kinds of obstacles that are my typical plot in life!  Thanks to these three I got everything I needed and laughed throughout because they are funny too!  I'll be going back in May next year when I need a place to put my top!  Thanks guys!</Review>< pictures>

<text>My uncle Erix came in today to rent a unit Rosa was very helpful. She was very nice and spoke spanish which is even better that way I don't need to come with him ever time. She offered him a really good price for his unit. Thank you for the great customer service Rosa and thank you for being bilingual. I know my uncle will be in good hands with Rosa. Plus she has a beautiful smile.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I would like to say that I am a person who has a large establishment. I was in need of expanding the storage area. I was recommended by a family member to this Public Storage service. When I arrived at the establishment I noticed the very clean area and the service provided by the manager named Rosa and her assistant Oscar, were without a doubt very outstanding, cordial and beneficial towards me. Without a doubt, I recommend this place for its service, security and professionalism.

(Original)
Me gustaría decir que soy una persona que cuenta con un establecimiento de tamaño grande. Estaba en la necesidad de ampliar el area de almacenar. Fui recomendado por un familiar a este servicio de Public Storage. Al llegar al establecimiento me di cuenta de el area muy limpia y el servicio brindado por la gerente de nombre Rosa y su asistente Oscar, fueron sin duda alguna muy sobresaliente, cordial y beneficioso hacia mi persona. Sin duda alguna recomiendo este lugar por sus servicio, seguridad y profesionalismo.< /Review>< Pictures>
