<review>I have just visited Mena for smog check, and I am 100% satisfied with the service I have received. The entire process (from greeting to the payment) took about 15 min and the owner (I believe he also performed the service) was so nice, kind, and professional. I can see why everyone gave a 5-star at this place. This place might not be the cheapest to do smog check, but by paying the appropriate service fee, you get the highest quality service. Highly, highly recommend!!!<//review>< pictures>

My brother referred me to Mena Smog Check because the service he received was top-of-the-line. When I arrived, Reda immediately greeted me and informed me that i would not be waiting for more than 10 minutes - he was right. He also was very polite and respectful. I highly recommend that you get your vehicle smogged here! A+++< /text>

<user_name>Janice Bonner<//user_name><Text>Upon my arrival, I was immediately greeted with professionalism and kindness by Mena.  He was attentive and careful in detailing the cost for both the smog check and the certificate before performing any services.
I sat comfortably in my vehicle while he performed the smog check.
He explaining which agency would receive my smog results so that could complete my registration, in addition to providing a copy. He was extremely helpful and I will be a returning customer as well as recommend others.<//Text><rate>5<//rate>< Time>

<Text>Came here to get my newly acquired car smogged so I could get it registered at the DMV. Reda, the owner, explained everything that he was doing and was extremely nice throughout the whole process. He really does try his hardest to get your car to pass the test, he’s not out to get your money if it doesn’t pass the first time around. Mine didn’t pass the first time so he gave it some gas for a couple of minutes and did the test again and it passed. Only after it passed did he ask for payment. Highly recommend this place and will definitely be back again.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>The gentleman was very kind and helpful.  Allowed me to stay in my car and he wore a mask while talking to me.  Was very quick with the smog check and gave me all the details prior to starting.  If I had a second car to smog I would definitely be taking it to him.  So I will be making sure I get my smog check done by him in two years.< /Review><response>{'time': 1608340974199, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your business and kind review god bless you'}</response><pictures>None<//pictures>< time>

<Review>It takes a lot for me to write a review and even more so for a smog station. By far the best customer service I’ve ever received bar none. Reda the technician is the nicest and most genuine person you’ll ever meet. If you need a smog check and are in the area defiantly call ahead and ask for Reda.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Went in for a smog check, and the owner turned out to be a very sweet man who made sure that I understood what he was doing. He was extremely kind in the way that he went above and beyond to make sure I got the best care possible for my vehicle. This was the fastest and most quality service my car has ever received. Much cheaper than other competitors in the area, and you can't beat service with a smile!< /Text>< Pictures>

Great service. Will continue to use this location exclusively. Service makes the difference.
Could not be happier and would recommend this location to anyone that asked me. Even if they were forced to raise the price, cause it’s a great price right now, I would still go here, and only here.</text>

I went for a smog check.   The owner was very nice and the smog check was super fast, I think 10 min.  My headlights were cloudy and he cleaned them.   The price is about average I guess for a smog but it’s worth the amount I paid.  I left pleased when I was expecting the worse.  I will definitely come back and I would highly recommended this business for your smog.</Review>

Come and support this shop! Reda, the owner, is an outstanding individual. He provides quality service and is very efficient. He goes above and beyond what you would expect. For example, my front bumper has been sticking out after someone hit me a few years back. Reda fixed it in seconds and now it looks like nothing happened! Also, I’ve tried numerous times to clean my weather-stained headlights, which he was able to clear out in no time!

This was the best service I have received alongside a routine smog check. For that, I’m recommending family, friends and you folks to support him. Most of all, it was great to meet a genuinely caring individual. Believe the reviews. He is a man of God and I hope his kindness comes back to him tenfold. God bless this business!<//review>

Best service I have ever received for smog check. Very kind man, greeted me warmly, cleaned up my headlights, and gave me a discount. Oh and it was super fast!  I'll keep going here.<//Text>

Reda, the owner, was very nice and genuine. His work was efficient and he was very kind. He also polished my headlights as a bonus. I highly recommend him. Great service with a smile.<//Text>

The shop owner is so kind and gracious, everyone should come here. He was telling me about his business and will soon be able to do repairs related to check engine lights, I'm glad to have two reasons to go to his shop.</Text>

<Text>Reda was very professional and provided excellent customer service. He was able to explain every step of the way for the Smog Check process, and had me in and out in a timely fashion. I would recommend his services to any and all people who need a Smog Check on their vehicles. I left the location happy with the service provided to me and all at a fair price.<//Text>< Name>

<text>Came here for breakfast. No one was around but still I was served by a nice lady who was friendly and kind. The place was neat clean, big and had good options for food. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered simply fried eggs with toasted bread. To my surprise I ended up eating a delicious brunch for less than 10 bucks: two eggs, plenty of bread, fries and fried pepper and other veggies. Highly recommended!<//text>< pics>

<text>Clean inside, the attendants do are very good job. But the only complaint I have is that some of the washers wreak of a mildew like smell. I believe that as much business that comes through that the washers should have a cleaning solution ran through them. This helps the smell and keeps it from transferring to your clothes. I used to have my own washer and you are supposed to keep the door open and use a washer cleaner periodically.< /text>< UserId.>

Love doing my laundry here, have been coming here for over a year pre Covid. When all the regulations went into place the staff here were  so great about making sure everyone felt safe and respected. The last couple times I have been here there is multiple people without a mask on and it makes me uncomfortable and consider going elsewhere to do my laundry. I am an essential worker and I already put myself and my family’s health on the line and every day when I go to work, would love to not have the same feeling washing my clothes. The staff does not enforce the guidelines and hope that it can get better for the everyone’s sake.</review>

Thanks for coming in.'}<//Response><text>Everything was going good till I used the restroom and realized I started my period and asked my fiancé to bring me a tampon. About 10 seconds after he walked in we hear the lady worker knocking on the door. We get out about 4 min after that. The worker then walks in and accuses us of making the restroom dirty. I told her it was already like that when I entered and she insisted that no one used the restroom before me. She then tried to argue with me so I ignored her. When she walked away I told my fiancé how crazy of a situation cause I never been in one like that before and she walked up from creeping behind the washers on the other side to argue again and say she wasn’t crazy. She then kept walking back and forth by us so I finally said excuse me to apologize to her for thinking I would call her a name; but she ignored me and rolled her eyes. I get that the area is “ghetto” which is why I didn’t want to go there in the first place but i was in the area after seeing family; but for her to look at us and basically say we are ghetto/ dirty is absurd and ignorant. I found it extremely disrespectful. To this day I’m still shocked on how someone would lie and assume we are the type of people to make that big of a mess. She swore she just cleaned it but then why was she walking over to clean it again ? I’m not sure but other than that easy place to do laundry if you’re not going to use the restroom or talk to the lady that works there. One other thing I forgot to mention was I called before and asked if they had free dryers and she told me yes; upon arrive and throwing my clothes in they were not. But they aren’t expensive what’s so ever.< /text><Name>Amber Dillinger< /Name>< rate>

I didn't want to do laundry today. But you still have go to work. It's convenient to pay with a debit card. But it is my last time here.  Laundry attendant tiesa was assisting another customer with their laundry.  As I came back from vacuuming my car
. I noticed her open my dryer for and place fabric softener sheets in. I informed her and she thought I was crazy. Asked me to confirm the washers I used stated the dryer was empty. And I cannot take my clothes out until the guy customer she was helping can come back and confirm that it's not his.i stated there's are indeed mine I can show you pictures of the clothes in wearing. As I went to retrieve my clothes hey standing over me. She kept murmuring things under her tongue in her language. The attendant kept shrugging hey shoulders when I kept saying these are indeed my clothes.. never once apologized and stated she's not wrong those clothes could belong to the customers wife. And insisted that I was crazy. Then stated she paid for my clothes to try if anything... You mean over dry?<//Text>

Very clean laundry place. New machines and great wifi.
The lady here is so friendly as well. She informed me many useful information regarding using detergents and the machines.</text>

<text>I'm getting tired of losing money every time I go to this place. Twice it's been a washer not starting, so I paid twice. Twice I've had a washer start but no water so had to redo it. Today the coin machine on the left ran out of quarters and only gave me $3 in quarters for $5 bill. I only go there once every 3 weeks I can imagine what they're getting off everybody else.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>I'm done with this place, I was about to dry my clothes in dryer # 23 and I find what looked like poop inside, disgusting. And now I'm standing here waiting for my clothes to dry and we got a homeless person taking a bath in the sink! Id like a full refund, this is the last time I'll ever come to this laundromat.<//Review>< Pics>

<name>Amber D< /name><Response>None</Response><Text>It says it has air conditioning, but it's so hot and humid that I feel like I'm having a heat stroke. it's claustrophobic because of how crowded it is, and there are barely enough dryers. I was able to find two but the one under mine took my quarters (something I saw happen to another person with a different machine.) Maybe it would be less busy on a different day but I'm here on a Saturday afternoon. The only bonus was the comic store next door was quiet and cool and a good place to kill time. Another good aspect was that there are workers that can be found easily.  (Also I guess I'm spoiled because the place I went to in Barrio Logan had vending machines with water so I wouldn't die. But I guess I'll just bring my own from here out.)<//Text><user>101887570046344700490< /user>< time>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>I only gave them four starts out of five because this place can get pretty crowded at times. But overall, it’s super clean and the laundry attendants are always super friendly and quick to help when machines don’t work 😊

I hate going to laundry mats where there’s nobody to be found but there’s always laundry workers on site to help with anything you need! —plus fluff and fold services?! SCORE!

Plus they accept credit and debit cards at ALL machines which is a big help since I hate carrying cash! They also wait a few hours to charge you so your transaction comes out in one big total rather than a bunch of small ones that will spam and shut down your bank 😊 which is awesome! Really love his laundry mat for my laundry needs!</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Well, I haven't been to a laundromat in a long time, but I had some really big comforters and needed big machines.  I looked up quite a few places and saw all the good reviews on this location, which is close to my house, so that's where I went.

WOW!!!  It is really a GREAT place to do your clothes!!!  Super clean, the two ladies that were there were very nice and helpful.  The entire time I spent there, the premises were being cleaned and polished and the floors mopped.

They obviously take great pride in making this chore as pleasant as possible.  I have a washer/dryer in my home, but I'm almost tempted to just take everything there from now on b/c it was so nice!

They also have free soap and you can use your credit card for the machines.

Finally, an outstanding place to do your laundry!!

Good facilities, helpful staff. I've been to half a dozen laundromats around San Diego, and this one was the cheapest - with no sacrifice in quality. Their single load washers retained detergent from previous washes, which was kind of gross, but the clothes came out so fresh n so cleannn.< /review>

<text>I am getting beyond frustrated that there is rarely any parking at this location.  I come at different times of the day and struggle to find a spot. I am starting to think that college kids are parking there, as SDSU is just down the street. One morning I was there, before any of the other businesses in the strip mall were even open. I asked the attendant why did she think the lot was so full, and she just shrugged her shoulders and made a 'iuno' sound. Then she said it was probably for the Optometrist. Really? For one, they weren't even open and two, I've never seen that many cars lined up for an optometrist.  Over the College Winter Break, I had no problems parking there at all.  But today, now that school is back in session, not a spot to be had. I circled the lot twice and even sat there, waiting for a car to leave. I could only stomach this for about 15 mins, before I gave up and came home. THIS IS BEYOND FRUSTRATING. This lot is not 'policed' as far as parking goes, so I am wondering if the other businesses in the strip mall are suffering. Something needs to be done. It doesn't help that I just  reloaded my laundry card, so I can't even go do laundry somewhere else right now.  I would love to hear back from either others experiencing same problem, or, the owner/operator of Wash n Go with a viable solution.</text>< time>

Always ready and the machines smell clean. Wonderful crew clean the machines and lint often. Love the change machine or use of swipe of my bank card. Or put $20.00 in and get 3 fives back and $5.00 in change to do all I need and not have my change stuck on a laundromat card. Free Wi-Fi good dryers as well free soap.</Review>

<review>No complaints they often have free soap after 9 AM.
They take change and cards for the laundry machines, and have cash to change machines if needed.
They will typically have the radio playing with two diferent televisions on, so that grows a little confusing as none of the audio in the area matches what you may be viewing.
If you want a nice price is their laundry cards which give you a cheaper way to pay for laundry.<//review></record>

<Text>I’ve been coming here since it opened I have always had a pleasant experience, the laundry attendants are for the most part nice and helpful. There is one attendant that I have seen a couple times and always has a poor attitude but I give her the benefit of the doubt maybe she’s had a bad day, that is until tonight last wash is at 9 I came in at 8:55 I put my blankets in the washer and than hear “ umm excuse me what are you doing? Get your stuff out and leave we are closed” I than said it isn’t last wash and 9? She than says well I’m closing early because I haven’t had a break and the owner said I can close 10 minutes early. After a back and fourth “argument” I ask her what her name is and she said “figure it out and get out” are you serious how is this person still employed? I’m sorry But I don’t think I can give them my business any longer if you are ok with your employer talking to your customers like that. And by the way her complaining that she’s worked all these hours and no break is not my problem take it up to the labor department. Sad to say neither me or any of my family will be back<//Text>< Pictures>

The staff was very rude to me. I was trying to dry my shoes with the blow dryer in the restroom (during one of the worst storms I have seen in my 5 years in San Diego!) because using a clothes dryer would damage it. The staff person then insulted me, calling it "interesting" that I was in there running the dryer and demanded I come out, saying that they have "dry machines" for such a task. I did come out at that point (so she wouldn't call the police on me!) and told her I would not put my shoes into the dryer with my clothes. She did start another dryer for my shoes but the dryer did NOT dry my shoes on the inside, something the blow dryer was doing a good job of! I didn't tell her I had taken appliance repair classes in my community college and knew what I was doing/talking about! This is just one of many places in San Diego where people just work, they have little to no knowledge about the goods/services they sell/rent...< /Text>

<review>*edited post

I have updated this post as this laundromat is and always has been one of tmy favorites.  I had recent concerns  and mgmt acted so quickly in remedying and reaching out to me.  You want clean hot dryers and attentive owners this is the place.  So many people use the fluff and fold and i have been coming her for over 6 years. Im not even in the area anymore but an still willing to drive 20 minutes. Wifi clean place, restrooms, working dryers free soap, huge washers makes laundry a breeze, and card readers on machines no need for quarters( high tech and innovation at its finest)

Thank you for your quick response!!!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

We have seen this many times before when someone is either in a hurry or has never used a side loading commercial washer. (UPDATED REPLY 8/28/18) We are looking into that exact washing machine to make sure its not a technically issues vs a user issue.\n\nWe kindly ask that you remove the three images and the negative 2-review review from the 6931 Google page.\n\nWe don't want anyone thinking our machines are not working when in fact they are working fine.

well it was too crowded with rude ass people. I waited at the customer service, for almost 30 minutes waiting for her I do not know where she went no one knows where she went she was gone more than that there was no sign up or anything saying she was on the break she's workingas of right now and today is Wednesday April 11th at 1:03 p.m. so after today I probably won't ever come back to this place cuz it's not worth it. PLUS THE LAST 2 TIMES I CAME, SOME OF MY LAUNDRY WAS STOLEN, AND ONE TIME MY BASKETS WERE. #SMDH #WORSTLAUNDRYMATEVER</Review>

We have been coming here for several months doing our laundry but most importantly drop off service has always been convient for us on busy weekends. The customer service from Taisa (blonde, thick accent) is absolutely HORRIBLE! We pay a little extra for same day service and as we come to pick up we are told that service is no longer available. Which on their website STILL states that it is. The lack of respect, the loud tone and lack of understanding blew me out the park. As she told us "My review of this place as she told us will not affect her or the place of business as there are others who still come here." TO ME THAT IS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! **If you like lost clothing lack of respect, and sometimes working machines this is your place!** This place will no longer receive our business!<//Text>

DO NOT DROP OFF CLOTHES FOR FULL SERVICE

They've lost my gallon of fabric softener twice. I was told by two separate staff members "I'll check and call you." Never heard back. Weird how that happens more than once.< /Text>

<Review>This is the first time in over a year that I've gotten my nails done, my nail artist was very talented and offer good conversation while she did my nails. In the past I've had issues at other nail salonswith my nails popping off the Polish coming off a day or two after the nail artist being too rough also getting the correct shape that I request for my nails, not one of those things was an issue here. For a full set with only $40 with gel polish and I have received multiple compliments on my nails. This is definitely my new go to place!</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Been here a few times. It's a really clean and basic nail salon. The women that do nails are nice and I have no complaints in regards to my experience.
The only thing I do recommend, is to maybe get a better waxer or have them practice more, because my eyebrows were done with bare minimum effort.. I am used to my old wax lady (at a different salon) spending ample time perfecting my brows, plucking them and making sure they are even. She did none of that.
My nails looked great tho so I definitely recommend Top Nails for getting your nails and pedis done!😊</Text>< pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I went into the shop today with my daughter. The lady Lisa, I think that was her name, first booth in the shop,  did an awesome job on my nails but she had the worst attitude I’ve encountered in a long time. She was rude in how she spoke and she pulled my arm A lot and threw my hand to the side when she wanted me to switch hands. I had to ask her twice if she could paint my daughters nails because she didn’t answer me and she said yeah let me finish first 👀. I said ok no problem I was just asking because you didn’t answer me. I was waiting to see how she treated my child because I would have lost it but she was fine with her. She finished my nails and didn’t put lotion or oil or anything on my hands. She never asked if o wanted a design or anything. I paid her, said thank you but no tip. I won’t be returning.  Gear work but ZERO customer service. No thank you.<//text>< pics>

I’ve been going here for a few months. This past visit I was told to come in at 4. When I arrived I was told to come at 6 since business picked up. I arrived and waited just over TWO HOURS to finally get my nails done. The work they do is great but the service can be very hit or miss. They can be very helpful and nice, I was even offered a ride home since it got so late and dark. But always keep in mind that the time they say isn’t always guaranteed.<//Review>

I've been coming to top nails since 2005 kasie does the best nails in lake elsinore, I wouldn't go anywhere else. Yes the wait is a bit long but the work is well worth it. Thanks for the great work you do.<//Review>

Actually ZERO STARS, this place has the WORST VIBES! Mostly all the workers have a bad attitude and if theyre having a bad day theyll take it out on you, they do the minimum job and if you ask questions they get mad, theyll be doing your nails and then go take a 30 min lunch break and not even tell you theyll just leave you there waiting, worst customer service ever!!!! Do yourself a favor and go to another.<//review>

Smokin Barrel is a first class facility. The facility is very clean and maintained to highest standards. I ventured into another range in Burbank and the targets kept swinging back and forth inches in each direction due to air flow it was difficult to enjoy the range. The Smokin Barrel has the most modern systems available. I never smell fumes and I can pickup my brass no questions asked. So best for last. With an influx of new gun owners safety is my biggest concern. The entire staff is the most professional, helpful and easy going folks I have met. The range masters are on top of it always providing a safe range and helping those who need help. Nobody ever gets yelled at or embarrassed. It's the perfect place for the novice or expert to plink and have fun. See you there and don't forget to tip the range masters and or staff although not expected ever. They are what makes this place so unique. Thank you Smokin Barrel.<//review>

<review>Great state-of-the-art range and facility. The range officers were cool, helpful and professional. Prices were reasonable and in line with what you would expect from a indoor range.

Simply the best there is. Staff is knowledgeable, professional and courteous. The facility is cutting edge as far as safety, ventilation and operation of target. Just awesome.<//Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I didn't know what to expect when I decided to buy my first firearm. My experience at Smokin Barrel was so good I needed to write a review. Kevin at the front counter made things easy, he explained the whole process and got my application started promptly, administered the test, graded the test on the spot, and discussed the 4 questions I missed (16/20, a passing grade). I picked up my gun yesterday and I look forward to going to Smokin Barrel to use it on the range. Last but not least, makes me feel good to support a local small business. Two thumbs up and 5 Stars!</Text><user>100164741025326299843</user><date>1601270098460< /date>< username>

<Review>Great place to practice your 2A rights. Very friendly and helpful staff. Large selection to find pretty much whatever you need for your gun. I am a first time gun owner and spent time at the range today, I was initially a bit nervous but really appreciated that they provided safety instruction that was clear and concise prior to entry to the range. Will definitely be back!< /Review>< Pictures>

Went recently during the madness and they were cool as a cucumber. Can't get closer than six feet to the display case at the moment but the dude who helped me out explained each gun to me in detail and took his time. Can't wait til the range opens up.< /review>

<review>Came here in December 2018.  No complaints, I would rather come here than go over the hill or into Oxnard.  I liked it good enough to get an annual membership.   The only problem I have is that I have not been able to get here a bit more often, not their fault I am busy.  Staff seemed very polite.< /review><name>robert stewart</name><rate>4< /rate>< Resp>

<rate>5< /rate><text>One of the best indoor ranges I've ever been to. The staff were very inviting and informative. The range safety officer was not "bugging" me whilst shooting but checked in on me every so often. I highly suggest this range for keeping familiarity with home invasion type firearms and any firearms in general. I will be returning frequently to use their facilities to keep myself proficient with use of all of my firearms. Great place!!!</text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

The shop has a friendly and helpful staff. They have a decent stock of firearms but lack heavily in the used and antique department. The range is state of the art but very expensive. $20 per person for just one hour is a tough pill to swallow. Overall a good experience, though.</text>

I haven't gone shooting in over 9 months and found this place online and though I would give it a try with my girlfriend and son. The place looks nice but still very raw and disorganized with the explanations of how to go about using the shooting range. They had the typical gun rental charge, lane charge, and bullets and target, but they charged for the rental of the safety equipment and for each person in the lane. They never told me I had a 1 hour limit and that if I stayed longer I would be charged longer so when I found out from one of the safety guys inside the firing range, we had to speed our shooting. Compared to the last time I went shooting, the bullets were very overpriced. Nice staff but very raw and not enjoyable.< /Text>

Good range but there prices are two high they need to charge a staight fee for the day not the hour. I would be here every week if there prices were not higher then other gun ranges. I hope they change the hour fee to a day fee. It would bring in alot more money and customers.< /Text>

<Time>1521065355405<//Time><Text>Very expensive to go there. They recommend no high shooting because if you hit the box right above your targets its $50 each time you hit it. When i went they have people who talk with you as they also count down your mins. I was told I would be charged another hr per person if we weren't packed by the time the hour was up.

Best indoor range in soCal.  Great amenities and safety #1.   I have read reviews by others complaining about range safety officers being nosy. Guess what,  that is because their job is making sure everyone have safe and fun time.   Just visit one of those ranges in LA county catering to tourists taking selfies with rental guns. it's accidental discharge waiting to happen.

I gladly pay extra to shoot here.</review>

This range is not for new shooters theirs a can like 10 inches above your target and if you hit it you have to pay 50 $  The owner of this place then told me he would of took it off if he caught it in time, then told my cashier to post the payment right after making that statement.  shooting is expensive enough i should not have extra penalties for being new shooter and not shooting that well.< /review>

They are a really expensive range. Yes they allow ARs but it’s like $20 per person with no same lane discounts. The ammo is very overpriced as well. In terms of the retail side they were not helpful when I came in looking for help getting a firearm that I had interest in.
I brought my business to Greta’s down the street and haven’t been back since.</Text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>We camped here in our fifth wheel a few weeks ago. It was a Sunday and really crowded.  We were half an hour early before check in so we needed to just wait. We saw a sign that said RV parking only. No vehicles. Perfect! A place we could hang out and wait. I jumped out to get food. Soon after my husband called and said he had to move the RV. I walked over from the cafe to see if our spot was open and it was, so I texted him to drive over to our spot. As I was helping my husband back in the RV, a woman walked up to me and pointed her finger at me and sternly said, “YOUR HUSBAND PARKED IN SOMEONE ELSE’S SPOT!” Confused, I replied, “what”?  She repeated the same thing, pointing at him and then pointing back at me for some reason. I said, “who are you?” She said she was the camp host. I was so confused because I had no idea what she was talking about. I explained there was a sign that said RV parking, and we were just waiting 30 min. for check in.  (See picture) It doesn’t say campsites. She didn’t care and said, “At least you actually do have a reservation because most people lie about that too!! So obviously you have never stayed with us , so let’s go over the rules!!”  She didn’t introduce herself when she walked up to me, just pointed her finger and yelled, was never friendly, and talked down to us the whole time. I’m pretty sure her name was Beverly. Then, the next morning at 5 am traffic began, since the RV spots are actually on the road, you hear everyone driving to work. We will never camp there again.< /Review>< userid>

I love this town and beach!  We are locals, lived here in SLO County from birth. We have always wanted to camp by the ocean in Avila but have never been able to get in. We have managed to stay at the RV camping up on the bluff. So, I was so excited when I managed to get a site at the Nobi area! Campsite #5 was the only site I could find available. For 4 nights!  Not over the weekend, but we were super happy to get one at all. The day we were leaving to come camp I checked the website and found out that Nobi 3 was available for two of the 4 nights we were there!  If you’ve been to Nobi, you know that site 5 is directly behind 3 and a camper in 3 can pretty much totally block site 5’s view of the ocean. Well, it was too late to cancel our original reservation without full penalty. But to us, it was worth it to pay for both sites to be able to have the unobstructed view of the ocean for two of the days.  I quickly reserved #3 and we were on our way. We stayed the first night with a small motor home between us and the ocean. The second night, the view was ours and we enjoyed it immensely. On the 3rd day the camp host texted me and asked when we were coming in. I responded that we were there already, parked in space 5. A few minutes later the camp hosts drove up, we had an issue and that we could not occupy 2 spaces unless we had another camper in the other one. We explained what happened. Their only response was, see the port for reimbursement.  We’ll we didn’t mind losing the money, especially if we had unknowingly broken the rules. The next day a huge Tiffan motor home with a full size Jeep pulled in, right in front of us. Gone was all of our view.  We were so disappointed. If we’d known the hosts were going to cancel one of reservations for that day, we would have chooses to move into the view site. But we had been told nothing about opening one of the sites we paid for to another camper.  My husband went to talk to the office the next day. They basically said, tough, you broke the rule, it’s too popular here for someone to have two sites and not occupy both. No refund. We ended up enjoying some days and hours with the spot in front of us empty. But the whole experience with the hosts was so negative it took a lot of joy out of our vacation. It could have been handled so much better, we are generally rule followers and would have cooperated with the rules, we just would have liked to have more friendly understanding conversations with the representatives of the port.<//text>

Great stay, best dog beach ever!!  We were on Nobi Point, site 5, which is right next to the road.  The site is really just a dirt pad, but the location was great.  We really enjoyed ourselves and the dogs loved the beach.  We’ll definitely be back.  4 stars because the road noise was rough - the first night there was what seemed like about a one - two hour parade of trucks at about 2:30am.  The next morning about 4:45 - 6:00 seemed like the shift change from the power plant and maybe some fishing folks.  That said, I’d come back - we really did enjoy ourselves.< /text>

Camp host was very friendly... Called to ask if they could give our reserved spot to another camper. That earned them a star.

But then they tried not to refund our payment.  Really?  Wow.  Ungrateful and greedy. Getting paid twice for the same spot.  Amazing how unethical some people are.</review>

Traffic goes all night long. Every shift change at the power plant brings hundreds of cars within a few feet of your camp site late night and early moring. $23 dump fee. They even charge for water. No refunds if you decide to leave early. Would not stay here again.< /text>

This is the ULTIMATE in scenes  !! Doug the camp host was a real asset and awesome ! Been hanging around here since 1975 and at 54 years old I wish I bought property here when they could not literally give it away. Shacks are a million dollars, very sad but good for the gipper I suppose... Very much my cup tea is the Harbor Terrace Project !!<//text>

Some of the best views for camping. It's within walking distance to the Port & services. They have showers and laundry services for quarters. The downside is it's all first come first serve with no reservations. It fills up fast so come before the weekend and holidays or you might not get a spot. It also pretty experience for camping and a 14 day max< /review>

$50-70/night?! That's insane. That's like $2000/mo, for a place to park. I've lived in houses and had apartments in SLO for less than that. That's the price of a hotel with room cleaning services daily. Is there staff going to come and clean my parking space every day, or at least between guests? nope. Ripoff.<//text>

Campsites are bare minimum. Very strict on no generator rule, although the guy next to us ran his most the night. They do not allow campfires of any kind, even a little Weber BBQ. The camp host was angry with the way my husband deposited our payment in the box and came and berated me for a good 15 minutes, even though I clearly had no idea what he was talking about and stated that to him numerous times. The only plus is it's an ok "staycation", and you wake up to beautiful views and easy access fishing, boating and swimming.</Text>

<text>Best part about this place is the View, which explains the 1st come 1st serve policy----- It is a short distance to Avilla Beach, which is great in the summer because of all the events going on- Only complaints were the sites with no hook ups, the crazy Bees, and the noisy seals at night,  oh and the nasty shower area. My  advice is go early and only get the no hook*up sites if you dont plan on bringing the kids or plan on staying a short stay< /text><Date>1528970443192< /Date><GmapID>0x80ecf8578b5f0ae9:0x759489e1699efc6d< /GmapID>< Pics>

Roadside rip-off :(

52 USD for dry camping in January, this place simply offers some roadside asphalt.

Showers were old and dirty, this place hasn't seen any love in a long time. Instead you get a rap on the door in the morning to remind you that checkout is at noon.</Review>

Caliber Collision European Auto Body offers the absolute finest level of service and repair. On our way home from the accident, we stopped for an assessment at a Caliber location near our home. Service Advisor Evan Murray was knowledgeable and accommodating. To make our experience easier, were able to leave our vehicle there and it was transported by flatbed tow truck to their European repair facility. Our Service Advisor, Lance Leonard, was with us every step along the way and kept us fully informed on the progress of our restoration. We appreciate his professionalism and personal attention to detail. General Manager Karen Michel even helped us with a vehicle issue that could only be remedied while the bumper was off our car. I only asked if I could make the minor unrelated repair for myself, and she generously asked her technicians to make the correction for us. Jessica in the front office was a pleasure to work with as well. Most importantly, our car looks better than before the incident ever occurred. Caliber Collision European Auto Body is in a class of its own!

Mr Kieran, the staff at Caliber Collision, and the tow truck driver were very professional at all times my vehicle was being repaired. Mr Kieran called me personally to keep me up to date the status of my vehicle. Their tow truck driver exemplified the best professional service. My vehicle has custom suspension and that did not deter from the staff or the tow truck driver from servicing my vehicle. That k you Mr Kieran, the staff of Caliber Collision, and the tow truck driver for their upmost professionalism and dedication to service to their customers.</text>

< Review>
I was in a crash that it wasn’t my fault however I decided to go through my insurance and they waived my deductible but I felt very confident choosing this caliber that has lots of experience with German cars. I did not worry at all and I think that they went above and beyond to not only get my car fixed but also to keep me in the loop and even did something extra where I had a little paint that was scratched and they fix it for me. Nice touch. My rep was Matt and I highly recommend them. I have used another Caliber where I wasn’t too happy but this one  sure!</Review>

<text>My car was sent here by my insurance company. They took about 5 business days past the original completion date, I had a rental car issued until the time of completion & since my car was not finished on time I had to pay out of pocket on the rental every day until my car was finally finished. Euro Calliber Collision called me and asked to drive to their shop 60 miles away from my home to deliver keys that didn’t even need. They asked for my bike lock keys and simply needed a Allen Wrench to remove a bike rack only to find out they never even removed my rack after finding some wrapping on my car. To make matters worse they stole my favorite NFL team prop in my window. The manager “KAREN” Promised to refund me for the rental a total of about $380.00 and it’s been almost 3 weeks since we talked. Miss Karen promised to refund me it was the least she could do after I lost money on my rental , spend time and gas to drive to their shop for no reason and then to find out they stole from my car. I take this all personal. My review is true.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

I could not be more pleased with the quality of work and customer service I've received from Caliber European! I've used them twice now for my for my 2014 Audi. Even after one of my repairs there was an issue with the headlight, which they spent plenty of time diagnosing and fixing for me. They're my preferred shop in San Diego and I can't say enough about them. It's rare that you come into a place who knows you by name and is as friendly as they are.<//review>

I had the pleasure of working with Matthew Weir recently on my Mercedes bumper. Caliber is the only Mercedes authorized body shop in the area -- that says a lot in my book.

Matt made the entire process easy and seamless. He worked with my insurer to make sure the job was done right and they took care of all payment. Matt was always responsive and extremely diligent.

I will use Caliber for any future body work needs on our cars. Thank you!<//text>

<review>Work done to vehicle is just ok. Nothing extraordinary as far as repair. Not everything was done as promised. After initall inspection and working on vehicle noticed all sloppy work.  One wheel supposed to be fixed all they did just put it on the front and try to cover damage up. But of course they charged insurance for it.  Also rear bumper sensor for foot operation for trunk opening wasn't installed back correctly. I could've been standing with groceries in my hand and moving my foot all day long nothing would've happened. I would recommend avoiding this shop. Don't get fooled by your insurance company and dealers take your europian car somewhere else.</review>< response>

<Review>Used them twice in the past 6 months.Best auto body shop I’ve ever been to. Aaron is the most professional service rep I’ve ever dealt with, has bent over backwards for me. Work and service is impeccable. And, this review doesn’t do them justice. I won’t go to another shop. Only one I will trust with my nicer cars.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>{'time': 1528750522630, 'text': 'Mike Moulton, thank you for the fantastic review!

I had absolutely the best service anyone could expect.  My Service Adviser was Justin Tostado.  He was extremely knowledgeable, professional and communicative.  Hopefully, I hope I don't have to go back to Caliber Collision with another damaged car, but I would not hesitate to go back.< /Review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>My new Jaguar had an unfortunate scrape with a stucco wall. Since it is all aluminum architecture, just any body shop would not do, not that I would trust my car to just anyone. Caliber Collision Foreign was amazing. Car looks like new, no tell tale signs of damage, super clean and it was ready within 5 days. As an accident investigator I know what is bad, good, great and amazing. This was amazing! Highly recommended. .<//review><gmapID>0x80dbf4c3004c3151:0x8802f762aabc4f95<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<rate>4</rate><review>Although I'm new to RV living...I've had absolutely NO issues since being here six months. The staff has been decent to me. The workers are friendly, and work hard cleaning and maintaining the park. Rent is computerized, which makes it easy and efficient.
My space is near the street, which makes it hard NOT to hear the traffic...but after dark here in the 55+ area, it seems nice and quiet.
Although this is my first RV experience, I feel safe and comfortable here, and am happy to give them four stars.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

< Review>
My first visit was nice, although I was just dropping off my girl at a friend's my visit was short it's a quiet place easy to find and fairly large mobile home park. Like most parks there's no street parking and sound travels. So you have to be quiet in there to not disturb other residents. It's most common with all parks, I did like the palms at the main entrance. They have lites at night on the which looks great .</Review>

" I had a problem and the landlords took care of it"
Depends which side of the fence you are on. Annoying neighbor doesnt know how to tell her dog to quit barking and Araceli has taken no action (6 months later) against something that should be common courtesy. But if we try to drown out her dog with our music, suddenly were at fault?
The logic doesnt get very far.< /Review>

Nothing But the worst Slumlords, you have vicious dogs everywhere, seen couple of pitbulls loose in the streets occasionally, always have shady/ tweakers walking around asking for food and money, you have a public homeless shelter in the front within the bushes or hiding around there, it’s like the new Americana 2.0 version, and don’t be surprise if your electric or water gets turn off for no reason for “Repairs” without any warnings</Text>

Been here 14yrs. and it has gone downhill. Poor lighting by the dog park, drugs, dogs running loose, people speeding and playing loud music, people on go karts, quad runners, 3 wheel carts, land scaping sucks in back. Administration sucks!!!!<//text>

(Translated by Google) Not rerecomiendo this place for three things the first today April 1 raised almost 100 dollars of sopeton suspect what are roving the tenants today binieron to ask me if they also raised me 100 without warning I told them that if the second is because there are many problems with the light I have a year living here and the light is followed by the problem that every time it takes up to 12 hours to fix it as a result your food is dropped aperder I regret seeing something grabbed here in this parking lot and the third there is no cleaning control or parking always agree in a saying that says one thing is to be poor and another to be a pig pig Marrano I do not understand many people who do not like to have their clean space nice

(Translated by Google) Very bad because there is no discipline, here everyone grabs what they want, they park in the street, steal things, and they are very aggressive, they hold parties and loud music until dawn and the Manager does not take anything I would like it to be More strict.

Muy  mala  porque  no  ay  disciplina, aquí  todos  asen  lo  que  quieren, se  parquean  en la  calle,  roban  las  cosas,  ay  jente  que  es  muy  agresiba, asen  fiestas  y  la musica  alta  asta  la madrugada y  la  Manejadora  no  ase  nada  me gustaria  que  fuera  más  estricta.</text>

Ryan with American Plumbing Group is my go to plumber for residential and commercial plumbing needs.  He just installed a garbage disposal for me (pictured) at my home in University Town Center (UTC).  Having done a fair amount of plumbing work myself for my occupation I can really appreciate the clean work, friendly service, and fair prices he offers.  He is a top notch professional.  When he has sent out employees to do work for me they always are very friendly and perform work up to his high quality standards.  I highly recommend Ryan and American Plumbing Group (APG) for any of your residential or commercial plumbing needs.</Text>

<text>Ryan is the plumber for our condo building in Gaslamp and I have heard nothing but great reviews from my friends about him. He is very professional, timely, friendly, and takes the time to explain plumbing fixes. He replaced my shower cartridge, repaired my leaky faucets and unclogged another plumbing issue. I really appreciate it!</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dbfff043b701c3:0xb6477ea355d620a1<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Ryan is great; I wouldn’t use anyone else. He does good work and stands by it, he’s quick to respond and his system of keeping you posted by text is efficient and helpful. He was on time to the minute and had all the parts he needed for the job. Highest recommendation.</Text>

<text>Ryan with American Plumbing Group provided outstanding service! Ryan is professional, personable, skilled and very efficient. When you encounter a plumbing problem in your home you need help quickly and Ryan was responsive; he answered my call right away and I was able to book an appointment for the next day. Not only did Ryan successfully clear our bathroom drains, but he also replaced a tub cartridge resolving a slow drip. I highly recommend APG and especially Plumber Extraordinaire Ryan!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Worked with Ryan today. He helped us with some old washer valves and installing our washer dryer unit. Very much appreciated his good communication, promptness, and attention to detail. Thank you for your help and now I can get to my laundry!< /Review>

Ryan is a champion plumber. That's the take-home message of this review.

If you are interested in more details: He did a phenomenal job in a house that was plagued with issues left and right. Very helpfully, he aided us in prioritizing what to fix, and how best to fix different problems. All without using any jargon and always clearly explaining how things work. He was promptly available to come work in our house, and was very punctual.</text>

<text>Ryan made a quote over the phone based on pictures which was very fair, he was on time and the work was easier than expected so he charged me less than the original quote.

He came back multiple times to check for leaks after the joints cured for enough time.

He's extremely professional and reasonable. I will call and use him for any plumbing job I have in the future. I've already called him back for another job</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80dbfff043b701c3:0xb6477ea355d620a1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Ryan came over first thing this morning. He was extremely professional and took care of the problem efficiently and effectively! He was so calm and really helped relieve my anxiety over my plumbing issues! And ladies, Ryan is very good looking (no disrespect Ryan)and that never hurts. I will definitely use his company again when needed. I highly recommend this company and Ryan in particular.< /Review>

<text>Ryan came out to inspect the sewer line and give us a quote for plumbing repairs on a house my husband and I are in the process of purchasing. He was very thorough and friendly, answered all of our questions, and sent us the quote quickly. We definitely plan to contact Ryan for any plumbing repairs we need in the future!< /text>< resp>

I found Ryan, the plumber, to be very professional and pleasant to deal with.  He was on time, in fact even a little early, which is refreshing, found the problem and fixed it within 20 minutes.  I would recommend this company highly and I plan to use them again for my next plumbing issue...since there always seems to be one with an older house.< /Review>

<text>Everything about the company was great.  I requested a quote on replacing my old hot water heater and Ryan provided a clear and fair estimate on all my options.  Ironically my old one started leaking the very next day and he was able to schedule me very quickly.  He installed a new tankless and it works great.  He was professional and courteous and very efficient.  He was recommended to me and I would not hesitate to recommend him to anyone!<//text>< rating>

I have used American Plumbing Group multiple times and always have a great experience, so when I had a plumbing problem recently, I didn't hesitate to call them again. Their prices are much more affordable in comparison to other quotes that I received from other "top companies" in my area. I spoke to Ryan, who was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Garrett came to my house to fix my issue and was so quick and efficient. They made my experience much less stressful! I will definitely use them again in the future!</text>

American Plumbing Group has been nothing short of fantastic. We had them out twice within a couple of weeks for two separate projects (install a new toilet and replace the flush valve on another toilet). Garrett did the service on both jobs. He was on time, courteous, and respectful of our home. He kept the job clean too. Scheduling is a breeze with APG and they'll keep in touch with you along the way until they arrive at your home. I hope that I don't have them to our house too often, but I will definitely use these guys in the future if needed.< /review>

Have nothing but great things to say about this company.  Garrett, our plumber is conistently professional, prompt, honest and the company's services are reasonably priced.  He has completed several repairs on our home and every time, gives us 5 star service.  He explains every step of the process, takes a conservtive approach first in order to save us money and has given us valuable information about our home and how our systems work. I will continue to trust him with all of our future plumbing needs.< /Text>

Okay, THIS is the plumbing company I will use from now on. Forever.

Like you, I was also searching online for reputable plumbers in SD. Let me help you out right now -- your search is over! Don't waste another minute of your time; just call APG and rest assured you've made the right choice.

I called APG today for a slow drain in my kitchen sink. From the moment Ryan answered the phone (on the first ring), my experience with APG was fabulous. Ryan was helpful, competent, and friendly, letting me know they could come out this afternoon. I received texts throughout the morning, updating me on my estimated appt timeframe (within 30 minutes, mind you, not the "we'll be there between 8am and 8pm" stuff), and also a text letting me know when they were on the way to my place.

Garrett, the service manager, showed up right on time. He was extremely professional, friendly, careful, and informative. With some initial examination and troubleshooting, he was able to get the drain moving faster. But he did advise me that, unfortunately, the problem wouldn't be completely resolved as there was likely a larger underlying issue with a broken or fractured pipe inside the wall. As such, he wrote up detailed notes on recommendations for moving forward for me to pass along to my landlord. When I asked him how much for the service call, he said zero -- since he wasn't able to fully eliminate the problem, there was no charge. Every other place I've ever worked with charges a flat fee just for the service call. Incredible!

It's obvious to me that APG operates on straightforward, honest, and ethical business practices and that their reputation is very important to them. I would give them the highest recommendation for customer service, quality, and competency.</text>

Super awesome escape room! As an expert escape room enthusiast, I would honestly say the Fair Game room was the most fun I had inside a room. The puzzle are extremely creative and takes the whole team to do. Josh was our game master, his briefing was top tier and he made my team comfortable and he hyped up us before and after the game. 10/10 I would highly recommend. Can’t wait to do the other rooms.< /Text>

<Text>I did fair game a few weeks ago and I came back today with my family to play prison break. We had an amazing time and there’s lots of fun puzzles that make you use your mind and body. I would 100% recommend you to try this room no matter your experience level. On top of the rooms there is great customer service with the game master (Max) being very encouraging as helpful.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I've done almost 90 escape rooms as of this review, and I can say without a doubt that Red Door has some of the most entertaining rooms in San Diego. I've played all of their rooms except Prison Break, and of the four I did, Gift was my favorite. I felt it had the best puzzle flow  of the rooms and our game moderator Zach was an absolute blast to talk with. Once Upon a Time was also very fun and whimsical, and the ending to Fair Game was quite possibly my favorite part of the games overall. Confinement was a good room as well, but the last puzzle in it was a little frustrating, especially for only two players. That took away from the experience a bit, but the room was still enjoyable as a whole. Many thanks to our awesome game moderators, Zach for The Gift, Amber for Confinement and Once Upon a Time, and Josh for Fair game. All three of you did absolutely fantastic. If you're an enthusiast in the San Diego area or just want to try out a new hobby, definitely give Red Door a try.</review>

We did Confinement and The Gift last night and it was an amazing experience! For a group of 4, both rooms were very doable and action-packed. We recommend both!

Confinement was our favorite. It provided a thrilling plot that had unique puzzles that were appropriately difficult and thought provoking. There were 1-2 times where we were stumped and needed a nudge in the right direction, but the puzzles were very outside the box and creative.

The Gift was very visually exciting! It was very clear that there was a lot of effort placed into the room organization and decor. The puzzles were a lot more linear and rewarding. The puzzle-solving felt a bit more classic than Confinement’s, so it was easier to follow through the story and know what to do next.

Our hosts, Sarah and Zach, were very good game masters that immersed us into the stories and enthusiastically guided us throughout our journey. Their clues provided just enough help to nudge us in the right direction without removing our ability to be able to solve it ourselves. We will definitely be asking for them when we return for the other rooms!<//Review>
<Resp>{'time': 1629751398350, 'text': "Aysell, thank you very much for such a thoughtful review about all of the episodes you've completed so far here at Red Door. Each of our game masters facilitates a unique experience for every group that walks through our doors! It sounds like both Sarah and Zach understood exactly what your group was looking for when solving these challenging puzzles! That makes us so happy to hear! It is so important to understand exactly what a group needs when they come for our episodes, so from beginners to enthusiasts we always strive to provide a six star experience. Based on your feedback we would recommend that you try Once Upon A Time. That episode fits beautifully into our storyline that you enjoyed, and especially since you've already played The Gift!

First time doing an escape room and the staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. The prison break game was a great start (although we didn’t escape). It was such a fun and great immersive experience. The game master did a great job feeding hints when needed but not giving too much information. I highly recommend trying out this place. Will definitely be returning.</text>

<Text>This is definitely one of the better rooms I have done. I usually have bad luck with fairytale rooms, but their “Once Upon a Time” room was perfect. Not super hard to connect the dots.

<text>I went there the other day with my family and a few friends and we all ended up enjoying it a lot. We did the fair game. I’ve been to 9 other escape rooms and this is by far the best one. The puzzles are very creative and a few of them require you to actually throw and move around. The halls and very well decorated with all sorts of 3d objects and inside the room the decoration are great too. I 100% recommended others to go and try it out especially if there beginners. I plan on going and down my another escape room very soon.< /text>< Rating>

An intense but joyful experience while racing down to the clock to try to escape the room. The rooms are very well decorated and you really have to work as a team to figure each puzzle out. Game master Sarah was excellent in helping us out and even since before the room started she helped us feel ready and in the best possible mood to start the day. No negative comments to add, overall very exciting and I 100% recommend this to any group of people, whether that be friends, family, or work related groups to try this experience. Trust me, you won’t regret it.</review>< Name>

This place was awesome. Me and my boyfriend found it by accident and ended up coming two nights in a row to play fair game. The employees there are so sweet, fun, and helpful. I’ve tried other escape rooms before but none of them were as fun as this one. This place has so much hands on stuff to do that involves teamwork. I’m going back soon to complete the story lol< /Review>

A group of five us went to celebrate a friend’s birthday and had a wonderful time escaping the Fair Game! Erica and Sepehr made our visit extra enjoyable and were extremely welcoming. A free locker for belongings and restroom were provided prior to the game.

The puzzles rely heavily on teamwork and communication to “acquire the sight!” Good luck!

Accessibility note: As the elevator is currently broken, stairs are the only way to access the puzzle rooms in the basement. This might make it difficult for wheelchair users.</Text>

Our entire experience was great.

From the start to the end.
We did the hardest room in this escape room and it was our first time doing something like this.
It was great
Amazing customer service and amazing experience I would 10/10 recommend to book for a special event with a group of friends.
Thank you Alex for being amazing and explaining every.

< Review>
What an awesome Escape Room experience. We played Prison Break, and it was a truly immersive game. Red Door goes the extra mile to create props and rooms that make it seem like you are really in jail. Max, our Gamemaster, did a great job. We could tell he was tracking our progress and conversations by the nudges and clues he provided.
We came really close to making it out, and are excited to try another game soon.<//Review>

My husband, son, and I had an amazing time in the Prison Break room! Our game master, Amber, was awesome. Very thorough, answered our questions, and made sure we were comfortable both in the game, and in their facilities. Everything is new and clean with awesome detail. We will definitely be back!<//Text>

Robby was a great host for our first Escape Room, and had helped us with hints my team and I were struggling with, with the amount of energy we have had left in our system 😂 will definitely do this again for part two, or maybe try the other challenges.

<review>Love, love, LOVE the room themes and attention to detail at this location! I have done over 20 escape rooms with various companies and I have to say that Red Door is one of the most immersive and creative companies out there. I've done two of the rooms so far and have two booked already - both Rachel and Amber were EXCELLENT game masters too - they made it all the more fun! Highly recommend!<//review><Date>1628615440899</Date><Rating>5<//Rating>< Response>

<Review>We went for our son's 14th birthday and had a group of ten people.  We split the group into 5 and 5 and went into 2 different rooms.  We had the young kids with us and my son went with our adult friends.  After our time was up because we did not escape we meet the group after and shared all of our expieriences without telling eachother clues.  What a BLAST!  The other group did not escape in time either but one thing in common was everyone was so mentally stimulated and talked about how it took the group to get through the room and we all will go back and try the other rooms.  The staff from the person that checks you in to the masters that run your room,   (our's was Lauren, she was more than great) will cater to each groups dynamics.  This place was very accomodating with lockers and restrooms and kept very clean.  Location is perfect for parking and getting food afterwards in the mall.<//Review>< Pics>

We played the Once Upon a Time episode. Our team had 2 adults, 2 twelve year olds, 2 nine year olds and a 5 year old. Everyone had a great experience. Even the youngest was excited about the experience even though she wasn't involved with solving clues. We used a lot of hints but only when we got stuck, and completed the challenge with less than 2 minutes to spare. Our game master, Alex, was helpful, enthusiastic and encouraging. Well done!<//review>

<Review>I went in just to get prices and all that kind of stuff and talked to the front desk person (I think her name was Sarah). She was so informative and very kind. Even pointed out the 50% off coupon online.

< Review>
Had my first escape room experience at Red Door and it was so immersive and fun! Our game master Aleks was extremely charismatic, answered all of our questions before starting and was very attentive while we were in the escape room as well. Even when we weren't asking for hints the encouragement and playful questions they asked us via the screen in the room assisted both with morale and getting us to think outside the box for solutions. I would love to have them as a gm again! We played through the Once Upon a Time scenario and the attention to details in the room/decor help you get into the whole thing that much more. The puzzles were challenging, but definitely doable with a group and the hints that Aleks gave us. I don't want to give too much away, but if you love fairy tales or high fantasy this is the room for you. Figuring each part out felt rewarding as the puzzles take thought and effort. Also, even outside of the escape room is decorated so beautifully- where we were briefed/locker area was like being in a sand castle!!! Definitely want to try other rooms they have and will see if I can request Aleks as our game master again!< /Review>

Our personal gamemaster Aleks was so phenomenal, we even requested them for a second experience! From their introduction and brief, to the personalized clues and congratulatory messages they left us on the screens in the rooms, we felt throughout that they were not only part of our team, but excited for us to succeed.

I cannot wait to come back to Red Door! So far I’ve done two of their rooms, Prison Break and Once Upon a Time. And I’m going to be really sad once I’ve done all of the rooms because they are so much fun! The experiences are so well thought out and really immersive! Especially Once Upon a Time! But by far the best part of the experience was our wonderful Gamemaster Aleks! I really felt as though they became a part of our team. And they were really encouraging to our success! I highly recommend going here. And if you can request Aleks! You won’t regret it!< /review>

The Red Door was just 3 weeks new when I gave it a shot. Our group had a great time! Game Master Lauren is witty and energetic. Her clues pulled us out of a lull or two. She was very helpful! The game was fantastic, and kept an interesting and evolving story theme going. Well be back to try the other rooms. I hear that they are related to reach other!<//text>

Amazing experience our game master sepehr was awesome. He was an awesome game master. We were so close to getting out. I loved the whole mystery finding clue aspect and how everything could or could not be a clue. It gives you such a rush. I had so much fun and I definitely want to go back and try all the other escapes room. It was not what I expected it to be it was so much better. Glad I got to go and enjoy the experience.</review>

Beautiful and spacious.  There were a couple parties going on during our visit and yet there was room to comfortably navigate and plenty of space for our son to play.  We enjoyed the park and the surrounding walkways.<//Review>

<review>Lovely little park. Very green, there is a path for walking and bike riding that runs parallel with the water. The one thing I didn't like was that there was some litter in the water, which I know is hard to maintain, but definitely sad to see. I came to feed the ducks but also saw some (surprisingly friendly??) geese.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOe8zHBYiFCqeFV5Ndc5bK7gNrFUMO2UfGCYBU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmUZkC7mA4eXcfbVGC_YNm-12ILAt6iuV2Rh4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxalFdBH1sB88dJY8-jum5gkbeve2leyqT3NM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTamvOyQblmimOmoaC2IVfxOFihFsAE5tVLqc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

The park is VERY shaded! Which i love cause I can take my granddaughter pretty much any time of day and there's plenty for her to go on that isn't hot. Royer park is one of the only parks that I know of locally with as much shade. It really is family fun.< /review>

<review>This is a great place for all ages. They have 2 play structures for children and lots of grass.

Not to mention tables for gatherings and park employees trying to keep things tidy.

There is also an exercising class that meets near the small children playground on weekends.

Not to mention all the bridges and long walking trail.< /review>< Response>

Very nice park to walk around and burn a few calories. Kids love it. Adults and children are usually very friendly. My 1yr old grandson, lovesss (yes, with 's') walking across both bridges watching the stream/creek. Especially, when the ducks are enjoying the water.<//review>

Too many ruff looking people there. I've seen on multiple times where cops had to be called in after a fight or someone trying to instigate a fight. Bathrooms are just creepy looking. Other than that, it's a great park for kids. It has areas for toddlers and older kids too. It's next to a creek with lots of wildlife and good place to fish. There was even a duck who managed to hatch her brood out right under the slide's steps.   I even managed to take a picture of those cute just freshly hatched fuzz balls before they left for the creek.</text>

My granddaughter, 12 years old, has her school baseball practice there. It's a nice area and the grounds seem fairly well kept.</review>

<Text>This park has awesome and unique play areas. The tennis courts are in good condition, and the basketball full-court is decent. After dark, you can press a button (in both the basketball and tennis courts) and light will turn on. However, like many parks, homeless often visit and whether or not that bothers you is up to you to decide.< /Text>< Pictures>

This is definitely one of our favorite parks to go to for the number one reason that there is so much wonderful shade. There are two parks, one for younger and one for older children. There are two sets of bathrooms and it’s just a bridge crossing away from downtown Roseville.
The only downside is that sometimes transients frequent to the park area, but they almost always keep to themselves.< /review>

Always well kept and clean. I am constantly seeing groups with pop up shade and lawn chairs. Lots of trees for shade. Also, for Pokemon Go players, there are several poke stops and 1 of the 2 gyms is an EX gym! Great place to meet up.<//Review>

Beautiful old neighborhood and the park is well kept however this is another park that the homeless  love to hang out at.Don't get me wrong most homeless have issues beyond there control due to mental illness and drug addiction, but some are just plain lazy.California is real good at letting the tax payer take care of problems they create.Alot of Moms take there children there to play this is not a good environment to experiment on whether or not the homeless can safely be around small kids especially if there issues are not known.LOVE AND GOD BLESS,HANK< /review>

You would not expect such park in the downtown area. There is a trail and creek going along with it that allows you to enjoy the nature.<//Review>

But the main reason I Visit this LOCATION is to be there every day in the instance that my beautiful Sisssta! is able to find her way back to where she jumped from my car and ran away.
She doesn't have to come live in my car again with me. I know that that is no life for a kitty. Sisssta! just needs to let me know that she is okay.
Somebody somewhere knows something about what and where she is.
If you're reading this and you happen to live in the Royer Park area please please keep an eye out for my Sisssta! please?!
Please see photos.
Even if you've seen her dead or alive living a happy warm life, PLEASE reply and just let me know.
It's been 11 long months of looking, but it might as well be 11 long years.
I will never give up looking for my Sisssta!
Ever.
So, if you know ANYTHING, please respond.
May God's Blessings Always Be Upon You!< /Review><Response>None< /Response><rate>5< /rate>< user_id>

Huge park with lots of shade from large old trees.  Multiple play areas for the kids.  Tennis courts, baseball diamond, walking paths. The green grass is beautifully maintained. Several reservable picnic areas for large groups. Very serene and peaceful in a beautiful neighborhood.<//Review>

This is a nice park that is mostly shaded. There are two different playsets, one looks to be old-fashioned. There is a scenic bike trail that begins at the north of the park.< /text>

This park is now very nice, lots of shade, play areas for the kids, and  easy access to downtown Roseville with new bridges, as well as extra parking too. Great walking trail as well.<//Text>

Seams unfinished or like there was no design to amenities  and building  more functional work out bars would be desired since it is a great park to run up to and warm up and catch on the way home to maybe make time for runners to talk or get to know one another since most ppl pretty much live in the same area and neighborhood.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><review>This is quite a lovely little park. The grass is perfect. The area is clean. There's an area for kids and families. The homeless keep to themselves for the most part and stay out of the way here. And RSVL has put in plenty of parking garages and bridges to access that parking. Very well done.<//review><Time>1572802587239<//Time>< pictures>

This park is limited on parking and street side parking but it does have great playgrounds for kids of any age.

The biggest complaint I have at this park is that it has a lot of dog owners that do not pick up after their dogs. Dog feces can be found in almost all of the common areas and kids, mostly, are suspect to stepping on or touching them. Not only does it smell but it is very unsanitary and nothing can be done about it, legally. This is very frustrating!</text>

Great park for families to enjoy. Lot's of structures to climb, slide and explore. Many improvements are new construction are underway and almost completed. There are so many beautiful trees that provide shade. The park is green, clean and well maintained Although, there are park benches near the play structures, I would like to see more park tables and benches where families can enjoy a meal while watching their children play. We had a very enjoyable day playing in this beautiful neighborhood park.</review>

I absolutely love this park! Families probably love it for the nice playground, but I love the bike path and arm walk. Right along Dry Creek, you can listen to the relaxing sound of rushing water and see lots of ducks.</review>

Great place to bring the family. When the homeless population is not out of control. The new walking bridge that leads to old town is nice.<//text>

<Review>Really nice and updated! Rated low on stars because half the parking lot is blocked off due to construction and the basket swings for really young children are the only thing fenced off with no access which made our visit a waste of time and there is no reason for them to be fenced off. Stupid construction workers!< /Review>< Pics>

I met out there last Sunday night for a group drum circle. The park seemed nice, playground was clean.
I didn't realize until we were picking up to leave, that I've been bringing my son here for the past 10 years to play at a different part of this park. I suddenly realized it was fairly big, a lot of room to run. nice houses surrounding the whole thing.< /review>

This is a very beautiful park with lots of trees and shade. There is tons of seating so this place would be great for parties or a picnic.

The park rests along Dry Creek. This is a great location for Creek walking. Be sure to bring bread for the ducks! They get very hungry.

There are multiple parks for multiple age groups, a huge grass area, a trail that links you to another park, multiple restrooms and so much more.<//Review>

My daughter loves this park. Only thing that could be better is cleaner bathrooms. Maybe a patrol car coming through to rid some of the homeless that gather at this park.<//review>

It's an older park, but there's a wide variety of play structures and things to play with. There seems to be a good amount of other kids and parents there to make new friends with.<//Text>

<text>It looks like Roseville has given up trying to combat the homeless situation here. There’s a lot of trash and people sleeping under bridges all the time. I was OK with the occasional person napping under a tree but it has graduated to almost Bay Area levels. As a taxpayer who lives in the city, it makes me depressed and frustrated.< /text><date>1589043140581< /date>< rating>

<Text>This is a cool park that seems to maintain a universally chill vibe!  Its a picture of a world how it should be, with people of all walks of life and character cohabiting the same area and doing so in relative harmony.  Having said that, it's a fantastic park as far as amenities,  too.  Two levels of playgrounds for the toddlers and the bigger kids.  The picnic area and 2 separate sets of bathrooms make this a fun park to have get togethers or to just take the kids to burn some of that nonstop energy.   It's a great park!<//Text>< rating>

Mature trees lots of shade. Plenty of grassy areas, large and small play areas, including swings. Has horse shoe pits (bring your own shoes) basketball courts, and bathrooms. The only reason for 4 stars is the there were a few too many homeless people in the area.< /Text>

Nice park the children  enjoyed it and there's a lot of shade. There is two parts to this park, younger children play area and older children part. Meets our needs 12yrs, 6yrs and 3 years.< /Text>

<Review>Very nice park set just alongside Dry Creek where it intersects with Douglas Blvd.  Playground, softball, tennis courts, and horseshoe pits.  Bike trail and creek access, as well.  Great place for families.  No BBQ puts though.<//Review>< Pics>

Best park in Roseville. Beautifully shaded with huge, old oak trees. 2 great play structures for little kids and older kids. Lots of picnic benches and a bathroom. Sometimes there are large groups with lots of kids because it's such a great park.</text>

Perfect family park. Filled with sporting events. No adult activity allowed. Purely for family members. Tennis courts, small basketball Court, green grass in other half for soccer, fisbie, nice Walk along creekside. Police patrol is excellent. Bathrooms as well but, not open all the time. Homeless people gather here Wednesday at 5:00 for ministry and food. Very active veteran community parking is hard to find. Other lot across bridge has more parking for park visiting community. Parking by park is utilized by our Veterans. No parking along street. This is a neighbor hood park.</Text>

<Text>Has fun playground structures for the kids, a baseball diamond and a nice trail to walk down. The only downside is sometimes you may come across the homeless on the trail which always makes me a little uneasy, but we've never had any problems.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Of course with all its shade and beauty it gets 5 stars. This is the heart of Roseville.  Over 35 years of family reunions and my first born birthdays were spent here. Will always love Royer Park!< /review>

We love this park, its defenitely in our top 5 parks within the Roseville and Rocklin area, however the homeless camps here have increased recently and therefore the trash all over the place, for this reason I'm giving 3 stars due to the trash issue is a serious matter.</text>

Dry Creek runs alongside of the park with Geese, ducks, bass, and even salmon when they come to spawn. Basketball and tennis courts and even a horseshoe pit. Large open grass area for soccer or whatever and a baseball diamond.< /text><rate>5</rate>< Response>

<Review>This park is amazing, been going here since I was a child & now we take our kids here regularly. Big, spacious, great shade coverage, 2 different playgrounds. 1 for toddler/tiny kids & 1 for older kids. Great for BBQ'n & parties, or events, pic nics, or just to spend some time in a beautiful park.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>
