Service was excellent and quick. They change oil and transmission fluid on one day then did smog on 2nd day. Have used them for other services And prices are very good. Highly recommend them.</review>

After they completed it I went on a 300 mile trip, after which I noticed a funky, burnt oil smell coming from my engine. I popped the hood and found a pool of oil sitting around my oil filter. I should have never taking this anywhere other than than Subaru Dealership.

I left this experience hoping that it has been a reliable  repair. I had to spend $500 more than the original estimate And never spoke with the mechanic. If there are any issues I will directly asked to talk to the mechanic and not just the front office person, Michele.< /review>

<Review>Our 2012 Toyota Highlander needed an oil change, and the usual place we use in Santa Rosa was booked out till the end of July.  An employee there, realizing we lived in Sebastopol which is where Golden Gear is located, recommended them (Alex) to us.
So glad we went with her suggestion!  We got an appointment the next day.  The oil change included a multi-point inspection and free tire rotation. Things under the hood needed attention.  Long story short, we had neglected (forgotten!) our 60,000 mile maintenance check (about 12,000 miles ago), and Alex took care of that for us.  He was easy to talk to and work with.  And he called us when the car was ready the following morning.
Alex is very nice, friendly,  professional and honest.  And he provided personalized service.  I’m glad we were referred to Golden Gear and will definitely be going back for oil changes and more in the future!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Had new headlights installed there because I couldn't remove the bracket screws. For a reasonable price they took care of my Toyota Tacoma in just under 45 minutes. Big O tires doesn't even provide headlight service. Golden Gear is now my first choice for all my vehicle's needs.<//Text>

Alex always does a great job caring for my car and keeping me safe on the road.  I value his skill and professionalism and, most importantly, his honesty. I feel very fortunate that Golden Gear is available to handle any car issues and perform scheduled maintenance here in Sebastopol.   Thanks, Alex, and the team at Golden Gear!</text>

I've only been here once but the owner Alex is straightforward and kind.
I took my clients car here for a smog and although a bit more expensive than the ones out of town it was worth the extra ten bucks.
I will probably bring my own Subaru in instead of taking it to big o tires where I've experienced many grievances over the last couple years.</text>

Great experience. Honest and informative. I took my car elsewhere and they tried to tell me a million things were wrong with my car and that I had to fix them all at once (over 3k+ in repairs). At golden gear I just told them what the error codes were and how the other shop said I needed to fix everything at once and Alex (the owner) explained to me that yes those repairs are warranted but not crucial to the drive ability of my vehicle. In the end Golden Gear just fixed the crucial components of my vehicle and I got out of there paying less $600 for the repairs (way better than 3k+) and my car runs great. 10/10 would recommend based on honesty alone.<//text>

Just moved to Sebastopol, was hoping to find an honest, knowledgeable shop close to my house. Though busy, they were able to get my wife's car in early for smog. I have an 05 Ford Five Hundred that runs well, but if I have issues, this is where I'll go for repairs. Thanks!< /text>

My girl accidentally put diesel in the truck instead of gas, so the engine was stalling out. GG auto charged 160 for "diagnostic" and Alex checked everything out. When we talked he said the gas smelled a little like diesel and white smoke from exhaust... it was most likely thing. So after checking the engine in a few ways, and checking that the fuel pump had pressure,  he drained the gas and put a few gallons of regular gas in. Started and ran fine.

Charged me $550 . I feel like I was overcharged. Not going back there again.< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Took my truck here to diagnose an electrical issue. I had told them I believe it was a problem with the pcm (engine computer). They came to the conclusion that it was in fact the pcm and needed to replace it. They said it was very difficult to find one but finally did and gave me an estimate of $1600 plus the $160 diagnosis fee to fix the truck. No way was I paying that much. I found the part online very quickly for $130 and installed it in my truck in 10 minutes. Worked perfectly. Don’t go to this place they will try to rip you off.< /Text>< Pictures>

I showed up needing a smog certificate. I was queued up immediately. Seemed like a matter of a few minutes the inspection and certification was complete.
I paid and departed a happy customer. Moyes I recommend.
Yes I will return.<//Review>

I know Alex from long time, when I knew he was running his own shop I didn’t doubt to take my cars to smog them at his shop. Alex works with ethics and integrity. I recommend Golden Gear Automotive without hesitation.<//Review>

Alex was so helpful, prompt and professional. He was ready to work on my car at the appointed time. He completed the work that day, so I didn’t have to come back. Alex was very nice to work with. It was a great experience</review>

I highly recommend Golden Gear Automotive. Alex is kind, friendly and very competent. He returned my car to me quickly and communicated with me well about what was happening with my car so I could make informed decisions. His prices are fair and he is honest. This is a family run business you can trust.< /Review>

Pretty standard auto shop.It has typical wait times compared to dealership and other shops near by. It took about 3 hours for an oil change. They didn't have the air filter for my car so they ordered one. Brought it back and took about 2 hours to replace. They don't have a waiting room but fortunately Sebastopol has enough places around to walk to while you wait. Prices were also competitive.< /text>

We were happy to see a young family man open back up our local automotive repair garage.
<br>Alex and his crew have been a real asset to our neighborhood this last year. I've had him replace starters, timing belts and he services our air conditioning. I own older cars by choice and he keeps theit mechanical parts in top shape. A new starter failed and he replaced it as a warranty, no charge
<br>You should try Golden Gear next time you want your car checked out.< /review>

I needed a Star Smog Certificate and Golden Gear was recommended to me by another shop. So I tried them and found Alex the owner/manager to be polite and accommodating. I was in and out in about 40 minutes. I would go back to them again for smog check and to see what else they could do. Also, they are very convenient as they are right next to the post office.<//review>

Excellent experience. The staff is friendly, polite and respectful. Alex, the owner, explained clearly and kindly, the problems of the truck without exaggeration. He repaired everything possible  within the estimated time. Very reasonable price.
I would highly recommend the place. Golden Gear Automotive  is the place where I will bring my truck for any service  from now.</Text>

Though Alex was not able to solve the problem with my old 1980 Chevy pickup truck, he was very fair in his costs and was able to direct me to another repair shop that might be able to solve my complex problem. I would heartily recommend Golden Gear for any auto repairs.< /Text>

<Text>I told him when I made the appointment that I had just reset the code and that’s why I was eager to get it tested before the check engine light came back on.  Instead of telling me that it takes a few days of driving around after you reset your check engine light in order for the smog test to pass they went ahead and did it and of course it failed because I hadn’t driven around a few days after resetting the check engine light.  They retested for free and are super concerned about the customer being happy and feeling treated fairly.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

The shop presents itself well and I had hoped that I would have a new garage to be loyal to. However, big problem. Alex told me that my truck was trashed, that I had blown a head gasket, I needed new heads and the truck wasn't worth it, and there was no way I was going to pass smog.

Well, the truck is running just fine, and I just passed smog with numbers far below the limits.  If it doesn't seem weird to you, feel free to explain to me why I shouldn't be unhappy.<//Text>

<Text>Made an appointment for SMOG check on the web, they were ready to do the test at the appointment time and I was in an out in 1/2 hour. A bonus is that they are in town and there are plenty of places within walking distance to hang out while waiting.

Golden Gear fit me in at my first choice for service time, they were friendly, efficient, and I even got to spend a minute cuddling the shop puppy while I was picking up my car.< /Text>

Needed a smog check on a 1987 vehicle, and they did an efficient job. Even though rear engine cover had to be unlatched for smogging, they didn’t have any problem or “extra charge.” Main thing is, I passed!</Review>

This shop opened after Lange's closed down. I have heard great reviews from friends and neighbors who have gone there since the new shop opened. Alex, the owner, is the head mechanic and smog tech. This shop comes highly recommended.</Text>

I had 1500 worth of repairs here that are supposed to be under a 2 year warranty it's been 7 months and 2 different mechanics have told me that the valve cover wasn't done correctly. I took it back to Alex who of course denied it. I'm so disappointed that he didn't even try to help me. I am now lost on what I can do except warn other people not to go here.<//text>

<Text>The owner made a mistake when I told him the model of my car for a battery replacement. It cost more to replace my battery than he had thought but he honored the original price. Very good sign. He charged significantly less than a nearby competitor.
He had space to take my car and had a good turn around on the repair.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808430a6965284cd:0x3cd8d61cc5bae2c9</gmapID></record>

<Date>1613781329285</Date><rating>4</rating><Review>They have a 7 room bed and breakfast with 3 hot tubs. And several rental homes. We rented the 1 bedroom rental house called the bunkhouse. It has a fully equipped kitchen with a coffee pot, a shower, space heater that looks like a fireplace. Even bath robes for your private hot tub just outside the front door. The views are incredible from everywhere in and outside the house. We even watched Buffalo grazing from our natural springs hot tub. There's an small ghost Town with neat stuff to look at and an old cemetery up the hill.<//Review>< pics>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Camped at Benton Hot Springs for two nights. Due to Covid restrictions I never went into a building. Registration was outside and contactless. Specific instructions about proper campground etiquette were written down with a signed agreement and a copy for guests. Each campsite had its own tub and was as private as physically possible without constructing a complete barrier around the tubs. The campsite tubs are drained and cleaned after guests depart. The campground is clean and free of litter. Reservations are months out, and all campsites are full.  This is a little gem on a less traveled road.< /review>< Gmap_id>

As a hot spring afficionado, I had to visit the Benton Hot Springs. We stayed for one night, tub was super clean and the temperature was perfect to soak for hours without getting overheated. There's nothing better than sitting in the hot tub at night with the crisp air around you, watching the stars for hours.

Bring a robe and extra towels with you if you're camping.

Will definitely be back again in the future to spend a full day.<//text>< gmapID>

Friendly accommodating staff there to welcome you. Comfy eclectic settings and clean rooms. Many clean hot springs tubs to choose from with soft fluffy robes available for use. Located in lovely shaded desert setting. Shaded outdoor seating available under big leafy trees. There is even a very friendly feline there that loves to be petted.
Great way to meet people from different walks of life and share a wonderful deliciously  prepared breakfast in the morning. Two breakfast times to choose from, 8 or 9 AM.<//review>

This place is Awesome! Relaxing, enjoyable. My first time there and it has to be on my number one places to go now. The atmosphere was incredible! Hot springs were the best was to unwind from everyday life. If your looking for a place to get away from it all and just relax this is the place. Rooms are incredible with a history and a time of their own. Simply AWESOME!< /Text>

Excellent camping spot and extremely relaxing. They have a no music policy which I agree with, unplug and take in the surroundings. Be advised, you may not have any cellular reception there either ( I certainly did not).< /text>

Great place.  Make reservations months in advance.  Staff is friendly.  No food because if covid.  Pull in.  Use the walkie talkie at the bulletin board.< /review>

A beautiful getaway with healing waters, surrounded by mountains and peace. What more could you ask for?
The smoke is visible some days and others none. It's incredibly worthwhile to come.<//Text>

Fantastic early summer stay. Hot springs are to die for. We were super impressed with the lengths at which the hosts adapted to Covid sanitation standards. Felt absolutely safe and responsible. Can't wait to come back.< /review>

<text>You would think with it being 100 degree weather the owners of this establishment would be considerate of their guest and think of them being in direct sunlight as a problem however they could care less!! Honestly how is anyone supposed to enjoy themselves when the sun is beating down on you with no shade option besides the one in the 90degree tub.very disappoint with management and how they treat guest would only reccomend to someone I hate to stay here.no customer service full of bugs and rudeness DONT GO HERE !!!!! Many other places that offer the same thing with more care don’t go here !!<//text><user_id>112252408757058392944</user_id><Name>Miranda Balderas< /Name></record></dataset><record>

What a perfect hidden gem! A few girls and I rented an outdoor hot spring here.  We set up our tents and soaked under the stars after a long weekend of hiking and it was quiet and perfect. So much Nevada history here too! Very interesting...a bit spooky next to the cemetary but we liked it 👻🤷‍♀️</Review>

I was impressed, It was very clean & cozy, quite & the staff are friendly & their breakfast cook is very nice & makes a great breakfast.
The only thing I would suggest is a coffee pot with coffee, hot tea  cause it’s nice to enjoy in evening . A vending machine with cold drinks snacks for guest to have access too if there late arrival or just want something to drink after hours. But yes I will come again & suggest this place to all my friends.😊👍< /review>

<text>Camping at Benton hot springs was a worthy challenge.  Online reservations were easy, though I wish there was more info on particular sites.  Nonetheless I booked site 3 which was very relaxing, each site seemed to have its own uniqueness and privacy.  it rained/snowed on our arrival night which made things a bit cold and wet. Travel dates middle of March 2020, Chains were not required.  Light snow, ice cold temps overnight, and partly sunny days.  It was nice to arrive with tub being filled with hot water. Odorless, very hot water. (Warning for those who are sensitive to hot soaking temps) Camp site had bbq and fire pit, picnic table.  No wood to be bought on site.  Actually nothing to be bought on site so bring everything in. Otherwise a grocery store is in bishop (40 mins away) no cell signal or WiFi unless you’re staying at the “inn” also breakfast is not included for guests staying at campsites or cabin rentals.  Bring your ez up. The best things about Benton hot springs:  Dogs allowed, Each campsite has its own private tub, & clothing optional.
For the price to camp in freezing wet temps, I would expect at least shower facilities or toilet, not Porto potties. Also some signage or information on water properties, etc. front desk staff was not very helpful.  They did not ask once how our water temp was or anything, and it was scalding at first.  Though I am pretty self sufficient I could see how guests would have a hard time navigating to their site if arriving after dark.  But the experience and hot springs makes things well worth the stay.</text><userid>117366387172873440049</userid><Response>None</Response>< username>

We loved our stay in the miners cabin! The cabin was quite rustic, but included all the details to make sure you're comfortable. This is the perfect place if you're serious about getting away from the hustle. Word to the wise, there's a small diner a few miles away for dinner, but it closes early.< /Text>

It's a surprising place! When you arrive, at a first glance, it looks like other places but then you discover how beautiful and welcoming it is. The miners cabin is cozy and romantic, the hot tube are surrounded by nature and they are so hot and relaxing...! And the breakfast? Wonderful!<//review>

This absolutely wonderful place offers quant rentals, cute vintage decorated rooms, family style meals and a charming self-guiding walking tour of the surrounding buildings and history of the town of Benton. With perfect views of the White Mountains, there is much to learn, and enjoy while visiting. The hot spring tubs are clean, and the soothing water is untreated and fresh. The inn staff is warm and accommodating. I'll absolutely be back again! What a gem!< /text>

Interesting historical spot. Individual hot water pools are top notch. Lack of RV hookups makes 4 instead of 5 stars.</Text>

We really loved this place. The ability to have your own private tub and pool your arvey right up to it was amazing. Even though there were others in the adjoining tubs we felt completely safe and had privacy. We are making Benton Hot Springs a must stop on our travels.< /review>

Three there are rules no music, no being loud, you can only be naked in your tub and if you don't follow them they charge you $50 for disturbing the peace. It is a great place though if you want to not talk and be silent.

The campgrounds are wonderful. We have stayed many times in The Old House--you walk into a set from the Old West, including a big comfy kitchen, porch with swing, and your own hot tub. The land here is gorgeous in every direction, with countless places to hike in the quiet gorgeous landscape. Bill and Diane are wonderful hosts. The memories of these trips sustain me throughout the year. Awesome!<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Our second stay in the Bungalow - we thoroughly enjoy the setting, the accommodations and attention to detail.  the Bungalow is an eclectic, comfortable and nicely furnished spot to enjoy the solitude of this beautiful area.  The kitchen has all the cooking and eating utensils needed to enjoy your own cooking in this tranquil setting.  the hot springs tub is wonderful!< /Text><gmapID>0x80bdf06ff6b62d6d:0x755a150ffc8572ec< /gmapID></record>

Breakfast, beautiful landscaping, nature and natural hot spring tubs, to name a few perks. Thanks Jimmy Dale! The campground rocks too, you're guaranteed a private pool for each spot, each set up a different way. My husband and I "vacation" here as often as we can.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80bdf06ff6b62d6d:0x755a150ffc8572ec< /gmap_id></record>

The Campsite at Benton Hot Springs is a piece of Heaven on Earth! The sites don't have electricity or water hookups, but come with their own private clean  HOT TUB filled with hot spring water. While soaking in the hot tub you have the most idyllic view of the desert Sierra Mountains in the backdrop. The star-gazing at night is also unforgettable! If you're driving from Yosemite to Las Vegas, this is an THE BEST night stop you could imagine!</Text>

You'll have to make reservations way ahead of time, but this is a really cool place to camp. Make sure you discuss with the owners how to handle the tubs being too hot, as the water was way too hot for us to get in without plugging and letting them cool off.<//Review>

< Review>
Our party recently booked a stay with Benton Hot Springs and we were very excited to visit and rent the bunk house, however, our beloved Grandmother passed away within the 72 Hour cancellation notice and we had to cancel to attend her funeral.  Just be aware that this resort definitely does not 'pay it forward'  No exceptions, no refund.  We will not ever patronize them in the future because of this.  Sorry Benton you lost out on at least some future business.  Very disappointed that even the more dreaded part of the human experience isn't considered in their deliberation of 'policies'.  Overall, it may be a wonderful place, but customer service is CLEARLY not a priority for them.  So if customer service is important to you, perhaps avoid this place.</Review>

<Text>We drove up, took one look and decided there was no way we could stay there So I went in and told the attendant..She said we had to pay anyway so it cost us one night's room rent.

The Inn appeared run down and there were no restaurants nearby as expected from reviews I had read.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Made a reservation online 3 days ago. Called today because I never received confirmation either way and they said they were completely booked. I asked why they didn’t let me k ow that so I could plan accordingly and they said it says on the site it takes 48 hours. I told him it’s been 3 days. What a bunch of idiots. This is terrible customer service, pull it together.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I stayed at the Benton hot springs last week on my cycling journey across the west from Colorado to California. The people who work here are the most caring folks in the world. when I arrived, I had a huge cut on my left leg from a collision I had had on the road during the night. I didn't have large bandages to cover the wound, but one of the ladies who works at the inn drove 38 miles to the town of Bishop where's the nearest pharmacy to get the bandages, a saline spray, neosporing, and some gummy beans for me. she went way above what was required or expected of her, and she made a huge difference for me to be able to ride the next 300 miles to San Francisco. Theresa, you are my savior and my angel! I would not have made it to the end without you. I will pay your generosity forward to someone else who is in need, and will treat them with the same care and love you showed me. Thank you!</Review>

If you haven't paid them in advance they don't want to even talk to you about the place and coming back.  When I got home I read others (a lot of them) who had the same thing to say, RUDE PEOPLE!!!!  Then I also read about all the problems people who have been there have had with the bugs and bites and having to go to the Doctor.  When asking the staff there about it they were even RUDE about that too!  So I am really glad that we didn't get to bath or stay so I didn't have to be miserable with bug bites and a Doctor visit!  I have been in many wild hot tubs in many states and many pay ones also.  I have never been bitten or infected or had to go to a Doctor.  If they are this RUDE to customers then one can only guess at their "cleaning" of the tubs!!  This is one to take a pass on!!!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80bdf06ff6b62d6d:0x755a150ffc8572ec<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The grounds are well kept with lots of nice little areas to hang out outside. They have a couple of nice patios and a barbecue for lunch and dinners. We stayed in the Marquessa Suite...the room has great charm, beds were comfortable and the room was clean. The TV had terrible sound but not a deal breaker. For those of you who care, the WiFi was very slow, but you cant complain since this is the middle of nowhere. I've stayed at other B&B's and the breakfast here was just ok. All in all I'm planning on staying here again as it was an enjoyable and relaxing time.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

This shop is amazing! Sergio and his crew did a wonderful job on fixing my car! I love the detail they also did on my car! If you ever get into a collision pick this shop, they’re professionals and have great customer service.< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>United was so helpful and communicative after I got rear-ended and needed a new bumper. They were very clear about when my car would be ready, updated me regularly, and were really hospitable when I went to pick it up. (The repairs looked great, and my car was spotless otherwise.) I will definitely come back to United for any car needs.< /review><username>Elena Saavedra Buckley</username>< date>

My car was almost 2 months there and when I pick it up I realized that the parts that they “supposed to repair” was very bad quality, So now I have to pay extra money to someone else to fix what they caused to my car. I don’t recommend this place for any reason!!<//Text>

Amazing job and quality work. I would recommend this place to anyone in need of help in a heart beat with my eyes closed. The best auto collision place in Los Angeles, no doubt. Very attentive, helpful and like always very professional. Phenomenal staff from the clerk to the technicians.</review>

Total time from the accident to the day I picked up my car was approximately 3 weeks. When I picked up the car there was some minor complications that United was more than happy to work out for me. I am extremely happy with their quality of service their level of professionalism as well as their outstanding communication very nice and pleasant people to deal with I would highly recommend them to my friends and family</text>< pictures>

United Collision Specialists is doing business right.  I was nervous about my daughter dealing with car repairs on her own in LA, but these guys took care of her.  Sergio and his team did excellent work at a great price, and even fixed some things they didn't need to without charging more.  They deserve your business.  My highest recommendation!</review>

<review>I brought my car in to have the front passenger side door fixed which was damaged by a rolling cart. When I picked up my car on the day they said it would be done, it looked like it had never had any paintwork done on it!

There was also a small dent on the front fender which was never included on the initial estimate, they went the extra mile to remove a dent for me on the fender, which I was never charged, they did it as a courtesy!!!

What impressed me the most is that they actually finished my vehicle on the promise date, unlike other body shops.  I was notified every step of the way by the estimator that was handling my car.  When I went in to pick up my vehicle, it was spotless!!  inside and out....

Living in greater Los Angeles area, insurance costs go up quickly, I choose to not go through my insurance company for the damage which ended up being a wise decision on my part.  These guys did the complete repair ++dent for less then my deductible.

Thank You Royal Motorsports!!!</review>< name>

I took my my car to United Collisions because of an accident. Right from the start, seeing how helpful and accommodating they are,  I knew I could trust them.  Serg helped me all along. He advised me on how to deal with the person who had hit my car from the back and wanted to settle without informing his insurance, and when I decided to call his insurance company,  what steps to take with the insurance company. My case was a bit complicated but all the issues were resolved in no time because of their  help. Now I have my car back and it looks as good as new.</text>

<review>I recently got into a car accident in the Fresno area and United Collision Specialist came to the rescue. I had to get my car shipped over 500 miles round trip, they did it with no questions asked. United Collision Specialist went above and beyond my expectations. My car had sever undercarriage damage which was not visible. Instead of Jerry rigging the car they did a thoroughly inspection and figured my car should be totaled so I would not have long term issues. I did not expect it to be totaled but after I saw the car stripped i was thankful that they took their time to find all the issues. They kepth me updated on every step of the way. They were easy to work with and were able to answer all of my questions. I will definitely be working with them again in the future.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
I've been coming to United for over 8 years. I started going to their first location on Pico Blvd and now go their new shop on Beverly BLVD. This is the best collision center in Los Angeles, hands down. Serjio and his staff will bend over backwards to help you get your car back on the road as soon as possible. Their work is incredible and quick! My whole family trusts this place to fix all of their European luxury cars. A++++< /Review>

<text>Friendly and courteous  service coupled with expert work. Serg and his team went above and beyond my expectations and fixed my daughter's car on a timely manner. There is nothing fun about being involved in an accident, but being treated as well as I did by United Collision Specialists team surely eased some of the inconvenience.<//text>< name>

<review>This place was nice at first, and I let them take my car, they noticed me in the street stranded, they seemed trust worthy, but now they have my car and they want to charge me $450 to get my car out, how much is towing anyways?...like $120,  I was never quoted anything. And a cousin of mine was treated the same way, but my cousin told me that at the end of it all, they don't show you an itemized list of the spending they do, so the work is pure cosmetic work, on the inside their could be broke peices and could cause an accident or worse. If they finish the work they don't go back and fix it, they have to charge the insurance again and again.. I'm working hard to get my car out of there, so far I havnt signed anything, so I should get my car out..one way or another.<//review>< Name>

I can't say enough about United Collision Specialists. Serge and the entire team are dynamic individuals who really took care of me and my cars. After my daughter was in a terrible accident, and her Mini Cooper totaled, United Collision came in and help us sort our problems between us and the insurance company, while storing the car. They were a huge relief in a traumatic time.
I then brought my Mercedes E400 to them for a full detailing, and the work was spectacular. It had scratches, chipped paint and needed tons of TLC. I drove off in a brand spankin new car. The best part is that they got the car at noon, and were done by 4pm. WOW!
Big thanks to United Collision Specialists...you guys are rock stars!</review>

< Review>
Hermosa Mexican Cuisine is a great local authentic Mexican restaurant in Hermosa Beach.  Love the quant restaurant with the homey feel.  Really good and authentic food- I recommend going to either breakfast or lunch and getting the salsa (which you can buy to go as well).<//Review>

Pretty good Mexican food.  My daughter loved the taquitos- the meat inside was excellent with great flavor. I had hard shell tacos that could have been a bit crispier. The chips were just ok. Overall - decent, 4 stars is about right. Will go again.< /Review>

{'time': 1596337296997, 'text': "Thank you for your feedback. The tacos and the taquitos are done on the grill, therefore sometimes they don't come out as crispy as if the shell was deep fried. We appreciate your business in these times."}<//Response>

Family run and operated. Cozy little spot near Hermosa Beach Pier. Yes, we all know the place is small. I don't recommend it for large parties. Order to go and have a seat on the beach, it's right there. You can't beat the view. Despite the size of the place, The real magic happens in the kitchen. The art of great authentic Mexican food isn't something you just smother with cheese and salsa. It comes down to the ingredients used day in and day out. Been coming here for years and it's hard for me to decide what is my favorite meal. The main man and the master chef always has surprises up his sleeve; the best meals aren't on the menu ;)

They're extremely popular for their breakfast burritos here. Well portioned and able to create it to your liking. You can't beat the price for the amount of food you are receiving. One of my personal favorites is the bacon cheeseburger. Yes, I said the bacon cheeseburger. Get it how the chef prepares it. Overall great quality of food. The best Mexican Food in the south bay, hands down.< /Text>

Great food, great little location... you can order to go or eat inside or at the 2 top outside.. it's all good at this place.. right near the beach for a quick bite while playing volleyball or sunning your buns..
Their carnitas definitely doesn't suck!< /Review>

Great Mexican food. I am usually hesitant to order tamales from restaurants, I took a shot and ordered the tamale and enchiladas plate. It was delicious 😋 We also had fun looking at all the neat things on the walls. I would definitely recommend! (we had a group of 6 and was lucky to have found seating. Sitting is limited, but don't let that stop you from checking it out, get it to go and hit the beach which is one block away🏖 )</Text>

<Review>Awesome little spot, you'll miss it if you blink. I have lived here for a year and it was my first time there. Very reasonable prices and fresh made food. It's smaller, so consider takeout or being friendly with your fellow diners. I don't mind community style seating and I'll definitely be back!< /Review>< pics>

<text>Hole in the wall place with solid mexican food. Owner is really nice! Definitely is vegetarian friendly and it doesn't make a dent in your wallet. I've been there twice now - first time I got their veggie tostada, second time I got their cheese enchilada and potato taco. Both times it hit the spot but I definitely enjoyed the enchilada/taco combo more. 10/10 would recommend/return!< /text>< Pictures>

Went through the drive through. There was two people working one drive through window. I guess one was training. Missing my cole slaw and chicken was not crispy like I ordered as well the wrong prices. Didn’t know until I got home. Drove back and the cashier on the inside still got my order wrong. He gave me the right chicken pieces but left out the mashed potatoes. I asked for a manager for compensation since MY food was at home getting cold. It took three times as long when the manager was putting my order together then it did driving to and from my home. I didn’t get any refund but he remade the entire order which I didn’t need.</review>

Staff needs to pay a little more attention to the orders they put together, bought a meal and only half of my order was in there luckily I dined in so just went back and showed them my box. This has not been the first time, also been short on items on drive thru unfortunately didn't check my order till I got home.....but it was not just a taco or anything of the dollar menu, it was sides and large order of shrimp but never said anything wasn't worth driving back since I drive 5 miles to try them. Very disappointing since I try giving way too many chances, but It's an every time thing I'm not sure if to return.<//review>

<Text>It always mess up your orders.they never give you your whole complete order without forgetting one two or three items.. today we ordered a famous bowl and they forgot to put the corn and the gravy. We ordered six tacos and they gave us four. We ordered three burritos and they gave us two.. this is typical for this taco Bell never go to the drive-thru because you will have to get off to get the rest of your food.. the manager is horrible she's like an Indian lady who never wants to give you the remainder of your food she will sit there and argue that the order is right even though you're telling her it's wrong.. this place needs New Management.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I had to leave a 5 star review for this place.   A worker there... Gabe (wish I would've got his last name) went above an beyond on service.  Took our order with a smile and while he was cleaning tables offered to refill our drinks and offered us napkins.. I know they're little things but your lucky to even get a smile at fast food places now of days.</review>

After finding out my  crunchwrap supremes did not have nacho cheese. I went in and requested they be remade. The superviser made a point by smashing my food and showing me she had put plenty of meat and cheese in it. Which was not true. Promptly asked for a refund and left.<//review>

Sat at the register for about 3 minutes before anyone even came to the cash register. The place is a mess. Dirty tables and floors. Its Friday night and as the dinner crowd came the line built up still once again with no one at the register< /Text>

Food was good but the restaurant was very dirty. We had been out of the country for a month and could not wait to go to our regular TB.  No soap in the women's bathroom, soda dispenser counter like a drippy river, come on guys!< /text>

The night crew is super rude! Mind you I'm very respectful and try to make peoples day/night. My festa potatoes were hard and the taco literally just had lettuce and cheese. I asked for hot sauce and the employe just  through it in my bag as I was holding the bag. I still mange to stay calm said thank you and he said "ahah"!<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>after finding a Bobby pin in my order I was told that my entire order would be remade for free. when I went to redeem it I was accused of lying, only got 1 thing made, and experienced the worst customer service I've ever seen. I have a large crew that frequently visits this place but we will no longer be supporting this buisness. absolutly absurd. I don't understand how these people can keep a job with terrible attitudes and 0% customer service.<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I had a bedroom flood and needed to replace the carpet pad and baseboards.  Called several carpet stores who really weren't much help.  Called Design Time and Tille.  Spoke with Aaron and he wanted to help.  He came out that afternoon, measured for the pad needed and said he would try to find an installer who could do it quickly.  He found someone who could install the pad and replace the baseboards in 2 days.  I truly appreciate his willingness to go out of his way to help.< /Review>

I had to put one star in order to write this review, otherwise it would have been zero stars. I called to ask if the employees wear masks and they said "No, it's YOUR choice to wear one". Well they just lost out on a 20k job! Nuf said< /Review>

<Review>Aaron Schmidt is very helpful, knowledgeable and honest. The showroom is stunning and very inviting. None of the sales staff are pushy, and the quality of material being used is second to none. 5/5 Highly recommend to anyone needing a top quality remodel!</Review>< gmap_id>

When you walk into a showroom with such a vast array of products as Design Time and Tile has, you need someone like Aaron Schmidt to help you hone in on what's right for your project. He is extremely knowledgeable about each product line, is great at understanding what you are hoping to achieve and is an utmost professional during every step of the process. I highly recommend him and the company he represents!<//review>

I worked with Peter Hurst. My fiancee and I needed to replace flooring or our entire home. Peter made a point to understand our need before making any recommendation. He learned that we had a pool and pets. He guided us to a durable yet beautiful product for the great room where wet pool feet would be crossing. For the carpet we really wanted to go with a white so Peter warned us about the need for a stain resistant product and helped us to settle on a leading stain resistant product we could feel good about. Peter has impeccable integrity and insists on delivering "above and beyond" service. I won't buy from anyone else.</Text>

Wonderful bakery with interesting selection. Everything here is a treat. We especially love the pastries and croissants. The strawberry croissant is particularly good. The bagels are soft, chewy, and have great texture. Flavor offerings are pretty standard however: plain, blueberry, cinnamon raisin, everything, onion, poppyseed, cheese, jalapeno cheese, olive, cheese spinach, sesame, etc. I expected a place called Bageloo to offer more interesting and original bagel flavors. I also expected the bagel flavors to pack more of a punch. While the textures of the bagels were excellent, all the flavors I tried were on the light side. Again, wonderful bakery and a local Diamond Bar gem. To have this kind of quality in a small town is amazing! Lastly, do expect to pay $$ for the quality. Fifty bucks got me 12 bagels, 6 croissants, a tub of cream cheese. Yum!< /Text>

I'm amazed by this Raspberry piece of art, in each of the raspberry jam is also being squeezed into, above the fresh cream are the crushed pistachio,   the most surprising part is the base is not soft instead it is actually meringue! The moment crushing into the crispy she'll is indescribable. With different layers of taste and just right sweetness, it's a piece of art!

I come here saying:" Gimme all the Hazelnut Financiers!"

Every
Single
Time

At the same time I want people to know how good it is and wishing nobody would take my pieces away when I'm there.

Except the hours are not quite friendly for working weekday visits...</review>< Pics>

Extraordinarily friendly service, delicious, fresh roasted coffee that was smooth and nutty, and the most enticing selection of bagels and baked goods in DB. I wish I could start every day this way!</text>

<text>I like this place. Relaxing music, good coffee, and a great lox.  My go to is a hot vanilla latte with the lox. Latte is a relaxing blend and the lox is combo of good fish, capers, onions, bagels, and okay tomatoes. It's possible to order the lox on a plate or sandwich. I prefer the sandwich personally but I like the presentation of the plate better.

The bagels at this place are solid. Everything bagels are everything I want in a bagel. A little pricey but that's about par for the course at a place like this. Overall I've already been here a couple of times and in so far as I continue to work nearby I will be back again.<//text>< pics>

<text>Horribly rude owners 🤮
Walked in today at 3:27...The owners didn’t even acknowledge me as they were preoccupied with a group of customers who they were chit chatting with. Finally the lady walks up to the cashier and just stares at me blankly - I suppose waiting for me to give my order? No greeting or anything.
I order a sandwich and she says she can’t make it because the kitchen closes at 3:30, which at that point it was exactly 3:30. I have been coming here for awhile and have never heard this rule, nor is it posted in the store anywhere. I would have made it before this deadline if they didn’t ignore me when I walked in. To top it all off, as I walk out, the guy is just standing in the doorway chit chatting with the same customers, and I have to wait a good 30 seconds for the customers to ask him to move for me! And on top of that he only moves a smidge - in an era where we are told to stay 6’ apart. It’s hard to support small businesses when they act so unprofessional.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><date>1606175364335<//date>< user>

<Response>None< /Response><review>Tentatively rating three stars for now. Had a latte and a Churro dossant. The latte was very light IMHO. No little foam drawing 😅 it's just like poured coffee in the mug and added some milk foam. The churro was very very oily.... I haven't had a churro for like a decade 😁 and maybe it is oily. Maybe should have tried their bagels instead.<//review>< Time>

Best bagels, pastries and sweet rice doughnuts. Twisted and glazed sweet rice doughnuts are very chewy and these are my favorites. Some people have never been to this place, but no one has ever gone only once!  You will not be disappointed.<//review>

I absolutely love the atmosphere here as the place is clean every time I come here and the staff are super nice! The bagels are very fluffy but have a nice chew to them at the same time 😍 The coffee is amazing and you can really taste the deep roast.</text>

I would give zero stars. We order 1 dozen assorted bagels to be picked up on Saturday because the business was not open on Sunday the day on which we would be having them for breakfast.  When I opened the box to verify my order I was in shock to find that they were already sliced. Yes it was a convenience but wrong to do so. I grew up back east where all bagels were packed whole. They last longer that way. I told the owner you  should always ask if the customers wanted them cut. We will never purchase anything from them again. BTW the bagels were only so so.<//review>

They make small batch pastries that you'd have to travel to the Westside to get, and prices to match. The only high quality crossiant I've found around. They have other brioche dough based goodies. Very worth it, imo. I've seen small specialty loaves and milk bread but haven't tried those. I recently tried a slice of the blueberry yuzu cake with yuzu pastry cream studded with fresh berries and covered in whipped cream and its heaven. I also tried passion fruit tres leches, so good. Plus berry cream. I've seen carrot and an Earl Grey. It rotates so you never know but you can order a 9-inch 3 layer with 3 days notice. $42 to $48 iirc.<//text>< pics>

This was a surprise! Don't judge this place by its location or exterior. It's tasteful and clean inside. The staff are quite friendly. The selection is great. The food is really very good and full of flavor! Coffee is solid. You can let them know how strong you want your pour over.< /text>

<Review>Great pastries and great service. I had a sausage, egg, and cheese sandwich on a garlic bagel, which wasn't the most impressive. My girlfriend got the same but with bacon and avocado. However, the pastries are unique and taste great. Also, the service was wonderful. I don't know her name, but our cashier/barista was super helpful with a lively spirit. 10/10 would recommend this place as long as someone like her is helping out.<//Review>< date>

My favorite and go-to breakfast/brunch/lunch place around the Diamond Bar area! I came here a week straight when I first discovered it and come here every time I meet with my friends! I’ve recommended Bageloo to so many people (including strangers who I’ve overheard talking about bagels in the area...). You really can’t go wrong with anything you order. The bagels are PERFECT. They do get quite busy so sometimes you may have to take your order to go, and the service is a hit or miss depending on who is working. They also run out of bagels by late morning, so try to get there earlier so you can see their entire flavor selection!

Update: I really hate to knock off a star, but the last 3 times I’ve been here, the same cashier has gotten my orders incorrect even after verbally confirming my order :(. I have to ask for no cheese due to food allergies but they melt it all over the sandwiches so it’s hard to take off when the order is to-go.< /review>

These Bagels actually tastes like New York. Wonderful selection of bagels and they have donuts and a fruit brioche. Coffee was wonderful nice and spacious inside and cozy. Can't see from the street unless you're on Grand going south. Do yourself a favor come on in and give it a try. You won't be disappointed.</Text>

I waited 10 minutes and nobody noticed I was standing there until I asked “can I please get some service?” 5 workers, all too busy to acknowledge me.  I was the only person in line and then a few people came after me.  I starred at them hoping they would ask me what I wanted.  Then sat down and waited 30 minutes for my bagel.  Everyone who came in after I did, got their orders before me.  Then, my bagel had barely ANY cream cheese on it. I threw it onto the ground for the birds. Total waste of time and money.  Terrible service.<//text>< pictures>

It'd been a while since I was at Bageloo. It's raining so I ordered their hot lemon tea.  Even a tea is delish! It feels like they prepare their menu items with lots of care for us! Thank you, Kelli for the high level of quality in service and food you all provide!<//Text>

Finally, I found super wonderful pasties!!!
I am so glad to move back to D.B from Newport Beach.
Now, I don't have to go to Melrose or Laguna Beach for perfect desert!!
I have been many desert store in France, Spain, Italy,,,,  Michelin star restaurants.... This Bageloo better than their desert!!!
This is place should be mark as "MUST to Visit" in California!!!<//Review>

(Translated by Google) I have waited for a professional coffee shop in the meantime, but there is a place that gives me the best coffee flavor by roasting it. I am happy to think that I will go to the next time. I am happy with the friendly smile of the owner welcoming me with a smile. A coffee sack that can give a nice and warm incense .. A round barrel of coffee roasted I was warm and sincere ... On a rainy day, I appreciate the beagle and the coffee,

그동안 전문 커피전문점을 기다렸는데 직접 볶아서 최고의 커피맛을 내어 주는 곳이 생겨 다음에 또 갈것을 생각하니 마음이 기뻐지네요..들어서면서 반가이 웃음으로 맞이하는 주인의 친절한 미소와 잘 조화된 실내 구조..정겹고 훈훈한 향을 낼수 있는 커피자루..커피 볶는 둥근통 마음이 훈훈하고 정겨웠어요...비오는날이면 밖을 바라보며 쫀득하고 아삭 거리는 베글과 커피 고마워요</text>

Customer service here is always great. No complaints at any point in time. If you are lucky to get the three regular ladies behind the counter on your day, you’ll probably get fantastic bagels and service. (August 2020)</Text>

Our family's favorite bagel store in South Bay. They open really early and have a great selection of bagels and smears. Jalapeno cheddar is our favorite and their mushroom Swiss egg whites on bagel thin is my personal favorite. Orange juice is fresh squeezed. Coffee is also great. Seating area is a bit tight indoors. You can phone in orders in case you're in a hurry and want to pick up instead of dining there</text>

Noah's bagels pass for bagels but if you want a GOOD bagel, head over to a house of bagels or the bagelry in santa Cruz. These bagels are soft and don't have a good consistency when toasted. On top of that, the amount of cream cheese is never accurate, it's either too much or not enough. It's not spread evenly across the bagel leading to inconsistent bite.

Calling these bagels is almost insulting to a true bagel, but if you want toasted bread and cream cheese come here.<//review>

I am a big fan of Noah's Bagels in the Bay Area. I was first exposed to their food when I came here as a visitor. When I moved to the valley, one of the first places I visited was my local Noah's Bagels. They offer a bunch of bagel options, a good vegetarian veggie melt and a good veg-out bagel sandwich. My favorite is their veggie melt but with two custom changes. I request the peppercorn potato bread which has a nice spicy punch to it and I request for their best cream cheese, the jalapeno salsa. The jalapeno salsa cream cheese has a solid kick to it. Coupled with the peppercorn potato bagel, it is a killer combo, par none. Try it and you will not regret it.< /review>

Food quality is okay here. Typical Noah's. Small store. Plenty of parking shared with the other stores in the area. Peet's next door. They need to keep up with the coffee supply since they were completely dry on both of their non-decaf drip coffees and a bunch of us were waiting a long time for them to bring out more. Staff were courteous and apologized for the wait.< /Text>

< Review>
I'm a really big bagel fan especially since I work in the area (perfect for a quick breakfast), however I am no longer going due to having an employee there snapping at me for not "ordering first and then paying," which I've never had to do before. It wasn't the first time having an employee act unprofessional and extremely rude towards me there.  It's a shame because I was practically a daily costumer. I don't recommend it if you want great service because you won't get it there.<//Review>

It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Lol. First time I visited was helped by a manager and service was awesome, but Ive beem 3 times since and it's hit and miss. Sometimes over crowded and workers seem irritable others it's chill.</Review>

I am a bagel lover, but this place,
I had a worst bagel in my life in this place.
Bagel was like a rubber and veggie cream was salty.<//Review>

<Name>Lynn Berry< /Name><time>1515518054975</time><Text>Only complaint about this store is that they recently changed their flow around the register. Before, I could pre-order bagels and go directly to the register and pick them up. Now I have to stand in line and wait my turn for the register. It makes pre-ordering less appealing. I might as well just place my big order at the register like everyone else.</Text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

OK beagles, but the service is horrible. Don't ever try to order anything special (like heaven forbid..."no onions"). There is a 100% chance your order will be messed up.<//Review>

I was speechless when I received my customized bag extender.
I have this vintage Gucci bag which I don’t use that often because I prefer my bags to be crossbody. I didn’t really know what I was looking for until I talked to Mautto. I sent pictures of my bag and they knew exactly what I wanted and the result exceeded my expectations. I’m so happy with the extender, it feels like I have a new bag that I can wear in multiple different ways. I can’t recommend Mautto enough and I will be ordering more stuff soon. Thank you! / Stephanie, Sweden</Review>

Thank you. Could not find a cross body bag that was big enough. My new straps made it possible for me to carry my Coach© bag. Perfect.</Text>

Thank you for creating a custom purse strap for my order. I was helping an older friend  by placing it. Although we had some trouble at first, my email inquiry was answered very promptly and all our needs were easily met. The purse strap arrived quickly and was even better than anticipated. Thank you!< /review>

<review>I have ordered from Mautto several times for small accessories such as the clips and loops. This is my first time ordering a cotton strap (blue and while combo with gold hardware) for a denim crossbody bag. It came wrapped nicely. The colors fits perfectly with the denim bag and the length is perfect as well. I can not be happier with my order. Will definitely order again in the future.<//review>< Pics>

<review>I purchased this Beautiful name brand purse, I loved everything about it...except the thin strap and unstable clasp that would dangerously and constantly unhook from my purse!
So needless to say I became desperate in search for a more steadier strap.
After a couple of dissatisfied purchases, I decided to give this unknown to me company Mautto a try!  It was delivered yesterday.  And I’m more than 💯% satisfied‼️<//review>< time>

I’ve purchased several leather purses with removeable crossbody/shoulder straps. These straps are always too narrow for the purses. I order the 1-1/2” canvass strap and it is perfect. I will order more for other purses!< /review>

Mautto is the best. Lynette is wondeful. She worked with me to custom design this strap you see in the picture. It is a perfect match to my bag and is better than the strap that came with the bag.  If you aren't sure about what you want I suggest that you e-mail them and ask questions. They are friendly and there is no pressure to purchase. This is my second strap with Mautto and I will be using them again in the future.I highly recommend Mautto.</Review>

I ordered a black crossbody purse strap for my Coach purse. The leather is a great match and the gold metal connectors match too. I had to order a wider strap than the original to get the correct color and texture, but I am pleased with the quality product and would recommend Mautto to others.</review>

I'm so glad I discovered Mautto! When even the most expensive purses have thin straps, usually either too short or too long, it's impossible to find the perfect purse. Knowing you can buy the purse style you love and simply replace the strap was a game changer for me.
It was important to me to find a quality leather with traceable reviews, because sometimes leather has a strong smell, or is stiff and hard. I was looking for a soft, pliable and well made purse strap, and I was not disappointed. I was able to update my new purse, which had all the wrong straps, and use the same new strap to update an old fave when I want to switch bags!</text>

<Text>I ordered a longer, adjustable strap for my alma bb ebene, and Mautto did not disappoint. The color of the strap, thinness, and hardware style & color is an exact match to the bag. I also ordered a strap off Amazon, and Mautto blows Amazon out of the water. The quality of Mautto is unquestionably superior, and the strap itself is softer. Amazon arrived faster, but Mautto is better. Well done.< /Text><Resp>None</Resp>< Rate>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Beautiful shoulder straps made of soft leather they also have multiple colors so you can match  your bag. They also have different sizes or lengths I find some of the bags I buy the shoulder strap are too long. PLUS they finish the strap no raw leather showing on the sides. Just go on line and have a look. Great people to work with.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808e17b6b14d8f21:0xaa82306265c8d8c3<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The straps I've ordered (recently as well as in the past) have been stellar in  detail, craftsmanship and leather quality.  The mahogany color straps work perfectly with all my monogram Louis Vuitton handbags.  The production and delivery of all items ordered has been quick and the staff at Mautto have been helpful and great at communicating with me when I had questions.  If I could give them 6 stars, I would.< /text>

Love, love this place.  My leather strap arrived yesterday and even though it wasn't specifically "designed" for my Tiffany bag - it is a perfect match! Beautifully made and worth every single dime.   Thanks Mautto<//Review>

<Review>My new strap is AWESOME.  Totally what I wanted.  I received a new Coach purse for Christmas with a thin cross body strap.....Not comfortable and I like having my purse higher up under my arm.  This new shorter strap is wonderful.  Tapered for comfort and it has lovely shinny gold hoops.  It looks really sharp and the leather matches my new purse.  And you shipped it out so quickly! Thank you!<//Review></record>

I’ve heard nothing but good things about their products, so I ordered the strap chain extensions. I just bought the newest edition of Louis Vuitton Odeon PM, but the strap was shorter than I would like it to be. I was saddened when the U clasp was too small to fit the O rings on the bag. Hopefully in the future they will adjust them to fit the newer bags.<//text>

<Review>First review ever. I love the strap and all the combinations possible. Allowed me to match a Dooney’s hardware and gave it an updated look. Now much easier to use as shoulder or cross body for the heavier purse. I love it. Well made and love the Bright colors!!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808e17b6b14d8f21:0xaa82306265c8d8c3<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I realized once my order was placed that the wrong size clips were added to my order. I emailed customer service to correct the size and they got back to me immediately and assured me the correct size clips would be added to the order. I received the beautiful gold chains with the perfect size clips. Now using one chain my Louis Vuitton hand bag can be worn as a shoulder bag or using two chains I can wear it ad s cross body bag. I will definately be ordering a leather strap in the future to make my Coach shoulder bag a cross body bag as well.
The service is great and I received my order in less than 7 days! AND Mautto's quality is superb!<//review>< Time>

<review>Omg, Mautto you are a life saver! So I purchased the Louis Vuitton Felicie Pochette in Vernis Amarante. Receive it last week, fell in love with the color and style but it did not go well crossbody. The chain was not long enough to drape at my waist. I called LV to see if I could purchase an extender or another chain to accommodate the crossbody look I desire...they do not sell additional chains or extenders other than the key chains they offer online says the rep. Saddened, I initiated the return with the rep to send back.

I got home and began to google LV chain extenders and came across Mautto. You had EXACTLY what I was looking for with the identical lobster clasp as my Felicie chain. I read the reviews and was convinced to order.  About an hour after ordering, I received an email notification that it had shipped. I placed my order on Friday afternoon and received it Monday afternoon. NOW THATS SERVICE! The links are slightly bigger...I mean slightly than the original chain but not enough to notice. My crossbody is a perfect fit AND a keeper!!!

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this site to my family and friends.< /review>< Pics>

I am so disappointed..... that I didn't find this company a long time ago!!!  My strap arrived today... 1 inch wide, Cognac color, shoulder strap with brass hardware and yellow stitching, to match my vintage Louis Vuitton bag. It is absolutely perfect! It came sooner than expected and it was also beautifully wrapped. I highly recommend Mautto!!!< /Text>

Upon receiving pics of the damaged shipping package and chain, Lynette immediately shipped a new chain that arrived in 3 days in perfect condition. The only unfortunate part of the transaction was that her reply emails to me went to TRASH rather than the INBOX so I did not see them in a timely manner. Imagine her frustration! Each of her reply’s were in a polite, professional and customer service-oriented tone.  I recommend Mautto’s products and will order from Mautto again.

I recently bought a very small should bag and luckily the strap is removable. I bought two chain wristlet straps from Mautto - one gold and one nickel - so I can turn my shoulder bag into a wristlet. The quality of the chain and the clasps is excellent. Very happy camper :)<//review>

<name>Kenya Swain< /name><Time>1436494310476<//Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>I ordered two straps to replace the ones on my Etienne Aigner travel tote.  I've had the bag for years and it is in great shape(except for the straps).  Etienne Aigner told me that they did not have replacement straps for the bag, so Mautto was my last resort.  I placed my order and the straps arrived quickly.  Unfortunately, I did not order the straps with the correct size hardware.  I called the company and texted a photo to explain my dilemma.  They had me send the straps back, switched out the hardware, and now I can use my favorite carry on bag again.  They were great and so is the product.  I wish I knew how to attach photos to this so you could see it.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I had a Fendi bag that was about 22 years old and the strap was starting to flake and degrade.  I checked Fendi's website to see about ordering a replacement strap: they were $500!  I thus began my web search and found Mautto.  I wanted them to create a new strap which made use of the existing Fendi hardware and which had contract stitching.  We emailed back and forth a bit, I ordered, then mailed them my old strap last week.  I got my new strap today and IT IS BEAUTIFUL!!!!  I couldn't ask for anything more!!!!.  The price was great, the turnaround time was fast, they were friendly and accommodating, and the finished product is very very high quality; dare I say it makes the purse look shabby?!  LOL</review>

My boyfriend and I visited yesterday May 13,2021 for lunch. Google had the operating times wrong so when we showed up at 10:45 the owner politely let us know they weren’t quite open but she let us sit down and poured us a beer. We ordered the pretzel with beer cheese as an appetizer which was so yummy! For our meals I had the pulled pork sandwich with garlic fries and my boyfriend had the linguicina sandwich and added the loaded fries for a little up charge. They were both so delicious and they surely don’t skimp on the meat!
Also... the blackberry cider is to die for. The best cider I’ve had!</text>

<Review>After a long hike, local folks recommended this spot, it was packed, but we were able to get seats.
Only negative comment was one waitress, said she was going to clean off a table and be back. Never came back.
Another waitress and a guy helped us instead.
The appetizers were on point! Poppers and beer pretzels were perfect snacks, flavored and scrumptious!
The gentleman told us about the beers and my hubbe loved the "Macho malt" so much we ended up getting a growler...
Lunch was so yummy, we got full fast.

We also appreciated the LOVE we got, def #LGBTQally!

Recommend highly.< /Review><user_name>Andrea Juarez< /user_name>< Resp>

Stopped in after our hike. Dope little corner brewery in the middle of downtown.. Beers are great. They have a beer sampler which is nice helping determining which beers you enjoy the most. Great table/customer service. Oh BTW my pup loved this spot too. The girls we're really nice about him and even brought him over a water bowl. Make sure you guys try the pulled pork nachos as an appetizer 🔥.  Will definitely be stopping by again. 🍻</review>

Obviously the customers weren't wearing their masks because they were eating, but even some of the staff had their noses out or used their masks as chin guards.
Aside from that, the cider and beer was great. However the food was average. I might go back for just the drinks next time.< /review></record>

<Text>No rush? No problem. The staff are friendly, and the food is decent. I tried the avocado toast and breakfast burrito my first time in, and both were acceptable for the price. The food took almost a half an hour to come with just a handful of other diners in at the time.

The avocado toast was much larger than expected, the bread was delicious and thick for being a white bread. The avocado was...bland...but a little salt, and the heart attack amount of pepper made it decent—along with the egg. The egg itself was perfectly done, but had obviously been sitting with the rest of the food too long as it was warm—not hot.

The breakfast burrito was a decent size for the price, and had a good portion of eggs, potatoes, and cheese. Nothing special about it, but a good price point.

They have a great selection of hot sauce, including Secret Aardvark (for habañero lovers).

I look forward to seeing the improvements time should bring. I’ll come back to give the rest a try.

Until next time!<//Text>< user_name>

<review>The food here was stellar, among the best brewery foods that my party had tried.  We tried and very much enjoyed the following dishes:
Mozzarella Stick - Cheesy and Gooey
Popcorn Shrimp - Well battered and with a tasty dipping sauce
Pastrami Sandwich - Salty and yummy
Garlic Fries - Done with Garlic Oil, so amazing
Deep Fried Jalapenos - Spicy and crispy

They also have beer!  The beer is good, but not great.  The food more than makes up for it though.  We did try like all 5 of their IPAs and they were all good beers.<//review>< userid>

Perfect place for date night for us while in Sonora. We always enjoy the food, service, atmosphere and brew! Owner's are good people. Very personable and family oriented, and that gives the business a small town but professional feel to it! The servers actually act like they enjoy serving! Very happy to support our first micro brewery in Sonora! Five stars⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐< /Text>

The staff is friendly and engaging, and the service is efficient. The food is OK, but certain items do not appear to be fresh: the fries seem to be frozen with a starch coating.<//Text>< rate>

Great new option in downtown Sonora. We had lunch & it was busy but service was great. Nice beer menu, good pub food, and excellent deli  food (it used to be a deli). I opted for the deli combo, with Philly Steak Soup - highly recommended!</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Awesome spot to stop for a bite and brew when visiting or passing thourgh Sonora! We had the Blonde with the Chipotle Chicken sandwich, and the IPA with the Caprese sandwich. Friendly and helpful service; our waitress let us taste the different brews before deciding. Definitely going to stop by on our next trip to Stanislaus!!!< /text>< gmapID>

<Text>Wife had to wait 15 minutes to get a cup of water. Food came out unprepared, ordered cheese burger came out w/ no mayo, no lettuce, or tomatoes. Gave it the all American try. Will give the old benefit of the doubt due to COVID but will not be returning for a while. Good location.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Very cozy and beautiful place. Family brewery and cafe deserve your visit and joy. You definitely can make likable selfies and pictures for Instagram here. It custom-designed with nice little touches. The cuisine is also exceptionally delicious, and they offer kraft fresh variety of beers. Conveniently located in the heart of Sonora's historic downtown makes this spot iconic and serene. Good for couples, singles, companies, and families with kids.
The kitchen offers breakfast until 11, so don't worry if you missed your omelet! You still have multiple options on the lunch menu.
Sonora Brewery is a very good place, and if Kenzie will serve your visit, you can consider that you gained the jackpot!< /text>< Response>

I feel in love with this place the instant I came in. They had little to offer, but over time they have flourished into an impressive operation and their products are some of the best I have. Definitely come check this out and see what's brewing in the house, and with the community it's serving.</Text>

Went for breakfast while visiting Sonora. Great staff, very friendly people in the kitchen too. I asked for my egg Benedict without bacon/sausage since I don’t eat meat and they offered the best alternative ever: crab! 🦀</Review>

The beer was good (I had the blonde). The staff was friendly and the atmosphere's nice. But, the veggie burger is one of those meat-mimicking burgers, which, as a vegetarian, I find pretty gross. I was especially disappointed because it was advertised as a spicy black bean burger, but definitely wasn't.<//text>

The grilled burger & fries was very good. Had to wait awhile for our food (me & my grandson) but the wait was worth it. I give it a big thumbs up. The service & waitresses are friendly & efficient. Need to go earlier & try their breakfast.<//review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>This was my 4th time eating here since they have been under new management. I wanted to give them multiple chances before writing a negative review, but unfortunately my experiences have gotten worse and worse every time...

I work in an office with 10-15 people and we have been ordering from lighthouse for years with no issues. Ever since Sonora Brewing Company took over the service and quality has majorly suffered. They have been 1.5 hours late for a delivery that was called in 2 hours ahead of time. They make (big) mistakes on every order. I even called them at 9am to specifically ask if I could order a veggie patty in place of a beef patty. They assured me I could but said we needed to have our order in by 930 or they wouldn't do it. We got the order in on time but they gave me beef and messed up on 2 other orders. They also threatened that they will not be doing "large orders during lunch anymore". How can you stay in business if you refuse to serve large parties? Their staff has been unfriendly on multiple occasions... when you go in the restaurant the seem annoyed to serve you. It's too bad because I think their food is good - they seem to use the same menu as lighthouse did with same ingredients - but after 4 bad experiences we will not be ordering from here anymore.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This review is not for the food because we were not served by this establishment. My husband and I waited 1.5 hours and watched three other patrons get seated after us and receive food in that interval. Perhaps there was something in the order that delayed its fulfillment (doubtful, because we ordered breakfast items in the morning). Perhaps they were overwhelmed with the number of patrons. However, they ultimately failed to communicate anything to us about the delay and served all other customers first, even ones that came in after us.< /Text>

<date>1563930919377< /date><rating>4< /rating><Text>Beautiful fixtures and furnishings, with stunningly finished bartops.  The brews were good, and the staff was friendly, efficient, and cheerful. But the bar seating is weird with 5 choice window seats, a pile-in with strangers 12 seat table, and a wall facing 8 seat bar. And nowwhere to hang your elbows and in front of an actual bar tender to badger.  A flight of four for $15 underscores the marketing position on Washington as more tourist magnet than your father's brewhouse and your brewers'
microbrewery.  A wonderful friendly family restaurant highly recommended for all visitors!</Text>< Pics>

We came in with about 5 minutes left to their happy hour (3-6 and 9-cl everyday)... the hostess was so nice and made sure to seat us quickly so we could get a happy hour order in. Not to mention, our waiter was so very welcoming and was able to let us order our happy hour food and drinks just in time. The happy hour prices are really good, and the food is delicious. Will definitely be back regularly! Great service, food, and ambiance.< /Review>

Good food (meats were great, and the pasta was good even by Italian standards!), good drinks, good atmosphere and kind staff. Big, clean restrooms and overall a pleasant experience, recommended if you're in the neighborhood.< /Review>

My friends and I ate here for Easter brunch. We called ahead briefly, but didn't make reservations and luckily they were able to seat us! They had a set menu for the holiday. I had Shrimp and Grits. It was yummy and I think all my friends enjoyed as well. A two-year old was with us and they treated her like a princess.<//text>

Mo recommended the 28oz bone-in ribeye and 7oz lobster tail to share. It was very good and cooked to perfection. Mo also recommended the perfect drink for my husband. Overall we had a great experience and I would defined recommend this place. Prices were also reasonable considering this is an Napa Valley Grille< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Nice restaurant for dinner, date. Big, but not over stuffy. Had dined many times since they opened. Chilean sea bass is pretty good, also turmeric crusted tuna. Good wine. I was meeting up with friends before when we only had couple of appetizers but mostly vine and good conversation. Very nice ambience.< /text>

Napa valley hosted my office for a holiday party. The staff was attentive and friendly. I went again with somw old friends for lunch. Love the chill vibe: think stone and fireplaces. I had the burger and it was everything I needed. I also tried a taste of my friend's rose sangria and another sangria option they had. Both were tasty.<//Text>

<text>We went to the Napa Grill a couple months ago, we must say our experience with the bartenders &
servers & overall service was very disappointing we only went back today Tuesday September 3rd right after the holiday because we love the food.  The experience was outstanding this time, everyone was pleasant, greeted us, engaged made sure we were served right away. The experience was so different I was shocked & very pleased, the food again was outstanding!   The staff working the bar area, need to be commended they were nothing like the people that work there a few months ago that served us. That ignored us we could barely get their attention,  more less order!
It made such a big difference with this crew working today, thanks for a great experience.<//text><Resp>{'time': 1567645833299, 'text': 'Audrey, thanks for trying us again.  Honestly restaurants can be fickle places.  Not only can we not be up to par, but our guests too can be preoccupied with their lives and we can miss that as well and not rise to the occasion.  For us, we do always try to deliver as best we can.  We so appreciate that you took time to write the good and the bad.  It is especially heartening since your last visit was such a good one.  See you again soon we hope,  Brian'}</Resp>< GmapID>

<text>Can't say anything about the food because I didn't have any, but the drinks are solid. The best part is the outdoor patio, which is a fine place to hang out and have a few day drinks.

UPDATE: I tried two appetizers and they were great. I highly recommend the fish tacos.<//text>< Pictures>

Barnabas was our amazing server and he did an awesome job with us. There were 6 beautiful ladies who got such amazing attention and service. The brunch menu was great and the food greater.

Friendly staff at the door greeting you. Once seated approximately 15 minutes before attended... Food appeared quickly once ordered....

Napa Valley Grille is a consistently great all-time favorite.  The menu accommodates most any palate; the food is delicious and the service is excellent. Today I had a very enjoyable lunch with a friend where the service was nothing other than superb by our waiter Jesse.
If you’re in the area and are looking for an excellent place to dine alfresco, or in a cool air-conditioned nicely decorated restaurant then take yourself to Napa Valley Grille.</Text>

I came for the first time tonight for a work meeting. Service was great. However, they were out of the turkey sandwich at 2pm when the place didn’t even seem busy. The Caesar salad I had instead had barely any dressing. Good fries and bread though. Not sure I’ll be back :(<//review>

Food was very good. Service pretty good. Ambience fair. 1 "modestly" priced bottle of wine, 1 appetizer, salads, 2 sides and entrée for four $250 before tip!
The sea bass and the double cut pork chop entrées generous portions. The sides are big enough to serve 4. Bottom line is I might go back, but it is not a must go back place.<//text>

We've been to this restaurant several times over the years. It has always had good food and great service so it's a dependable, go-to choice. However, they must have a new chef and/or menu because this visit, the food was terrific from the appetizers through the dessert. Everything we ordered was just a bit better than we could recall from prior visits. Definitely a case of getting better with age!!</text>

Have been here several times for dinner with friends.
The staff is always friendly and welcoming. One time a friend had a little stumble outside and the staff immediately helped out with a first aid kit.

The food has some very fresh choices with seasonal vegetable options, everything is well seasoned and well grilled.

I also came here for a private event recently on the patio and the Tumeric Lamb Skewers were fantastic! Also had some very good fried chicken sliders as well as beef sliders that evening. I remember the wine being very compatible with the range of different seasoning in the small bites.< /Review>

<Review>Been here for the first time with a friend from abroad. The waitress has been very nice, friendly, and helpful. However, sometimes, she disappeared for a long time, it looked like she had to take care of several tables across the entire restaurant (which is big), and we had to wait for her repeatedly.
There's been honey on the cheese board which we spilled on the table, and it stayed there with no one bothering to wipe it off.

The food has been very good. Incredible sauce for the filet mignon, awesome crust on tuna, and the wine has been just perfect.
The dessert wine from Canada has been beyond my imagination, I'm feeling happy to have tried it.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Great place for HH!  I'm sure dinner should be pretty good too.  Stopped by before we visited the Hammer museum.  The food was good and the server was excellent.

We ordered some kale salad, chicken sliders, sweet potato fries and some Sauvignon blanc white wine.
The photo basically speaks for itself!!

All and all it was quite pleasant.  Though it's my first time reviewing this place, but it wasn't the first time here for me, and it won't be the last time.

4 solid stars!!< /text>

{'time': 1570651273199, 'text': 'Steve, we are so happy with our new menu.\nThanks for your review. New menus take time in general. We change our menus 3 times a year so the menu is always pretty much new. The response has been fantastic actually. People are loving the new Scallops plating with bacon, the Chilean Seabass, the tumeric seared Tuna and the Bison Burger to name a few. At lunch we have gotten a lot more vegetarian and gluten free and even potentially more Vegan when one omits cheese from a dish. As for fine beers, we are very happy with the selections from Smog City and Madewest that we currently feature.  Very well made and very tasty!!\nAppreciate you taking the time, Brian'}< /resp>

Beautiful restaurant, it's got a cozy and laid back ambiance while still remaining chic, and the service is great. We shared a few dishes--the flatbreads, broccoli, and sauteed potatoes.  Everything was to die for, typical american-style dishes (salads, steaks, soups, seafood) but all had a unique flair. The wines were also priced really fairly, and they had a pretty good selection. Definitely recommend, as an after-work spot, meeting up with friends, or as a more laid-back-but-still-trendy date night.< /text>

My wife and I were in town from Phoenix for a few days and came across Napa Valley Grille while visiting our daughter at her office next door.
We returned later for dinner and really enjoyed the food. We ordered the Steak with tater tots and the Lamb Rump. Both dishes were phenomenal. Service was a little slower than I would have liked but Dave Myers, one of the Managers stepped in and made it happen.
Thanks to him, we'll definitely return the next time we're in town.< /Review>

This was for dinner before a play. Service was excellent as was the meal.      We shared the kale salad. I had  rare seared tuna and my friend had salmon. We also ordered a side of brased brussel sprouts. I brought a Napa Valley red wine. Knowing we were attending the play the waiter moved things along so we had plenty of time to walk back to the Geffen Theater. Room is modern and relaxing, quiet.</review>

We love this place, esp perfect for large business lunches. Pleasant staff. We are addicted to the green salad with maple olive dressing. FYI, great for post Hammer lunch. Really a 5 star place, but this is LA so.....subtracting a star because multiple times lately--even at off peak hours---a crowd of us wait over 30-40 mins at valet stand. Maybe Uber/Lyft, skip valet & enjoy everything else about the restaurant (?)<//review>

<Text>Salad and soup was good, pork chop was very tough and inedible to my taste. I had to return it. I ordered a burger which was ok. Neither the waiter nor the manger apologized to us. My husband also had a pasta which was ok but nothing special.< /Text><date>1562123889166</date>< user_name>

<review>I only went during happy hour. lunch and dinner are way more expensive

Napa Valley grill has an excellent happy hour. I believe it starts at 3pm.

I started off with the melonball martini, it was pleasantly delicious/ freshening. After that I tried the apple something sangria. I recommend leaving out the cinnamon. My friend tried the cherry float which had Bacardi, a different liquor and is topped with whipped cream. It was suspect lol but still ok. The happy hour menu varies, they offer 4 martinis, a nice selection of wines and mixed drinks straiting from $5 to $6. Beer is $4.
mini sliders are $2.50 each but well worth it
Napa valley salad is $4 and good
MAC and CHEESE $4 I highly recommend
the crowd is older.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJgG3hY_EfoogstxcC1GvKRVlhRlPpURMn0HT6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>{'time': 1499460247395, 'text': 'Dear Tiffany,\nThank you very much for your feedback.\nWe are happy you enjoyed our selection of drinks and food we offer for happy hour,\nand we hope to see you again soon.\n\nHave a great day!\n\nBest Regards,\nMassimo Marmorino'}</response><gmapID>0x80c2bc819e68e19f:0xd07725e890452c4e< /gmapID></record>

Great post-concert or after-theater dining experience... A little bit pricey, but worth the extra penny. Definitely a grown up outing, not the type of place to go get rowdy with friends.< /Review>

<Review>This place is wildly overpriced for what it offers. It has a small menu of meats, the usual tuna and poultry served with zero garnishes or sides. It used to be a fairly good restaurant. What happened? Our waiter on my last visit was delightful but tried to sell me the most expensive glass of wine on the list, a total rip off.</Review>< pics>

This experience has dampened my desire to eat at this location.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Huh.  We drove across town to come here as we often have but this time we were turned away.  Because they were closing.  It's only 9pm.  Weird.  Doesn't seem quite right.  I guess they don't want any further long term repeat business.< /Review>< Pictures>

I had intentions to eat here but the B grade in the window from the County Inspection was the downfall.  As a health and safety consultant, I researched their inspection history and they have a poor track record with the County even a shut down this year.  I'm sure the food taste good but was the food prepared with integrity? Idc howuch the food cost,  I need assurance that my food is prepared with integrity. -ZR, EHS</review>

Very unprofessional staff. I've made a reservation a week ago, 3 hours before the dinner they called me and informed me that someone paid more money and patio is reserved. I had a few private parties at Napa, will never come back again.</review>

This place only caters to the locals and resorvations.went their was told all the booths were reserved.Then when I went to the bathroom saw people who did not have reservations during in a booth. Then I ordered salad no dressing ,it came with oil and vinegar .The rib eye was not a steak ,it was sliced meat with a piece of cheese. We ordered Tea the waiter brought us a coffee cup with a tea bag but only one cup.I saw him barring a bo x of tea to the other clients. Never came back to ask if we needed anything. On top of it all when I asked to see the box of tea he made a joke to our waiter laughing as t us.< /Text>

My first visit tonight. I was highly satisfied from beginning to end. The staff were so attentive. The atmosphere was super cozy clean and wonderful. I ordered a fresh plate of oysters. They were SOOO perfect!! My caesar salad was very creamy with the right amount of dressing. My prime NY strip cooked just right was served with charred onion-thyme jam, green peppercorn cognac juc, literally melted in my mouth. Last but not least my cream puff with strawberry mousse had an excellent amount of crisp and puff. I’m deff coming back here. I will post more pics from the lunch menu next!!! Overall the price was fair for me, the quality of my food was exceptional!!<//text>

Had a wonderful time, and as a fan of wine and big dinners with friends, this place is PERFECT!! Large groups, like mine, had a blast in the private dining room. And with no Room Rental Fee, we were happy to eat and drink the night away in our own private space. Also, LOVE the happy hour! Who can beat 3-7 for yummies and drinkies I'll be back, in fact I'm here now!!<//Text>

Friend made a reservation here for a club banquet.

Our waiter was definitely one of the most helpful waiters. Really cared for making sure we stayed within our club budget for the reservation in ordering food and just gave wonderful service in general.

Our group split the charcuterie plate and I have to say that this is wonderful. I'm a fan of charcuterie in general and it didn't disappoint. Wonderful prosciutto and cheeses!

I personally got the oven-roasted turkey breast sandwich. It was alright. Not the best sandwich I've had, but not the worst either. I did enjoy the flavors, but the turkey was pretty dry in general. I also got the peach-infused iced tea and this was good! Not sure if they do free refills, but definitely would want to get this if I come again.

Our group also split a bunch of desserts. All time favorite is the bread pudding. The waiter recommended it and I was so glad they did. I'm not the biggest fan of bread pudding, but this one is definitely worth checking out. Not too sweet and the roaster marshmallow on top definitely adds to the flavor. The dark chocolate fudge brownie was also great -- honestly no surprises because this is such a classic dessert and it was done well. The toffee date cake was also good, but not my favorite. The strawberry marscapone cake was served in a mason jar, so not the best dish for sharing, but was definitely good as well.

Anyway, solid place for a nicer, fancier brunch, but definitely a little pricier.<//Review>

<text>The decor and overall vibe is on-point, but don't let that fool you-the food is a disappointment. The juxtaposition between the sub-par food and the upscale atmosphere made for an overall strange dining experience. Food was overpriced and frankly, just bland.

A $17 plate of fish and chips should not come with an ounce of flavorless, crappy potato chips. "Chips" used in conjunction with "fish" means French fries, and at least a serving of actual fries, instead of that pathetic excuse for potato chips, would have made me feel like the exorbitant price was more worth it.</text>< pics>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Review>Came here during the week for a work lunch. This place is surprisingly full during lunch. Although we didn't have reservations, we were able to get a seat on the patio which was gorgeous. To start, we ordered the blue crab cakes to share. They were perfectly seasoned and melted right in your mouth. Really really good. I also ordered the short rib sandwich and a side of chimichurri fries. The fries were so amazing that I ate every last one, despite being full. I love garlic and chimichurri and am a serious French fry snob but these were some of the best. The sandwich was far less to call home about. The meat was really good and tender but the sandwich was lacking in flavor overall, which was disappointing. I wouldn't order it again. Our service was good and the ambiance was a mix of older women and business people, but it's a great place to go in Westwood for a nicer lunch.</Review>< Pics>

<text>I came here for a company sponsored dinner last week and had a great experience. We were in a private room so may not have had the same experience as sitting in the main dining area... but still very good!

Food - I had the braised short ribs which were very good, moist, and melted in my mouth!
Drinks - Try the no-jito cocktail! It was like blueberry/blackberry mojito! DELISH!
Dessert - We had a 3 dessert sampler platter which was a great choice and

Service - Our service was great, the waiters joked with us, refilled our wine very quickly (:)) and were able to detail the food options very well!

Overall - I would definitely come back to this place... a little out of my personal price range but good for a work sponsored dinner!</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Napa Valley Grille is an outstanding fine dining establishment.

First, I was very impressed with how large it is with a nice long bar, spacious main dining area(there is also a private dining room) and a beautiful, large, airy lounge with plush couches overlooking Westwood.

I decided to enjoy my dinner in the very comfortable lounge.  My server, Carlos, did an excellent job telling me about their offerings.  I also met the Manager, Sebastian, who was very helpful and informative.  The bartender, Erik, was also very professional and on point.

Napa has a large variety of classic American cuisine to satisfy the palate.  I decided on mussels, roasted filet mignon 8 oz.(medium rare, Nebraska corn fed beef) and an Artisan cheese board.

The mussels were succulent and delicious as well as tender(many restaurants cook them too tough but these were just right).

The cheese board was wonderful.  The variety was very good with raspberries, blackberries and honey to complement the fine cheeses.

The Star was the roasted Filet Mignon.  I asked for medium rare.  The steak was cooked perfectly.  The taste in the steak juices and sauces was phenomenal.  I also added the soft cheese from the cheese board for even more flavor variety.

The Steak I had here is the best I've had in LA so far this year.  Well done Napa and Chef Carlos(also named Carlos like the server).

For wine, I had a glass of Frank, Cabernet Sauvignon 2014 Napa Valley-superb complement to the steak.

The atmosphere at Napa was very comfortable, classy and works well for either romantic dates or business meetings.

Napa Valley Grille is one of the best 10 restaurants I have been to this year in either San Diego or LA and my #1 pick for steak.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Handmade Bolognese was bland. Rack of lamb was bland. Service was okay. Waiter made some recommendations off the menu but was not familiar with everything on the menu when I asked about the salad that came with the lamb and the kids sliders.

Kids cheeseburger sliders were dry and flavorless. I actually ordered the hamburger sliders but the waiter brought the cheesebuger sliders. Waiter also brought the sliders out with just cheese and none of the toppings that was listed on the menu. He took it back to the kitchen and brought out two large pieces of lettuce, two slices of a tomato and aoli on the side and told me that's how they normally serve the sliders. I sent my lamb back to be cooked longer because of a personal preferecnce and the waiter brought my plate back without the balsamic drizzle, so I asked him about it, he took my plate to the kitchen and two seconds later came out with what looked like someone quickly squirted the sauce onto the plate and put it all over the food instead of taking the time to draw the intricate culinary art design next to the lamb like on my original plate. I just sent it back and didn't order anything else. I did however order a side of seasonal vegetables along with my lamb and they were good and a large portion as well. The whole time I felt the waiter was trying to be nice and say and do the right things but he wasn't really friendly. He was attentive however.

Everything was priced high and the lamb dish was the most expensive. I was at least expecting it to taste good but it needed salt.

This place is dissaponiting seeing that they have fresh handmade pasta, nice location, a lot of dinning space, great decor, white table cloth and a bar, but the food lacked flavor, the service was okay and the bathrooms weren't clean.  This just wasn't a good dinning experience, I regret not bringing it up to the manager. Definitely not returning.<//Text>

<text>To drink I had a two house special drinks, I forget what they're called but his was a lemonade with hinder and other stuff mine was chamomile tea lemon ginger and soda. We started with the wagyu meatballs and the charred cauliflower. PERFECTION.  My entrée: steelhead trout, his was the house made  lobster ravioli 😇😭😇 it was so delicious I will definitely be back to taste the rest of the menu.

Other stuff: Our waiter was super nice and attentive but not so much that he was always at our table. The atmosphere is romantic in the dinning room with a fire heated patio outside. Parking doesn't seem very fun so we took advantage of the valet out front. We walked in with no reservation on a Friday night, I'm not sure if thats normal but it worked out great for us. I would definitely recommend this place for an anniversary dinner, birthday date or some other grown up reason. I wouldn't bring anyone under the age of 15 unless they just booked a reoccurring role on a Disney show or something...</text>< pics>

Seriously over priced.  No salad with chicken should be $27.  My friend and I each had a salad and a bottle of water (shared bottle of water) and with tip we each paid $44.  It's way over-priced.  I'm never going back there.<//text>

Been there only once.
This place fancy itself as being fancy, however I couldn't ignore how some of it is fake, starting with the decor that tries to much and the service that wasn't as professional as one night expect.

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Excellent restaurant highly recommended very well located in Westwood ideal to share with friends or family. The kitchen is very good you have a good bar with many varieties of drinks and wines. It is in front of the Hammer Musseum so if you visit the museum you can spend a contribution here. It has valet parking. It has a great outdoor space around the corner.
