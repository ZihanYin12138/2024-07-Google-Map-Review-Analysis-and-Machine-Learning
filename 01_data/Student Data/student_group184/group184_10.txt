If you’re gonna work there with an attitude dont work there. I came for a simple two questions about a package that is late on their behalf, and  talked to me as if she didn’t want to serve. She was serving everyone with a bit of an attitude and it ruined our visit, the vibe she created was as she didn’t want to help anyone thats in the line. Black woman with braids. Lightskin.</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>I actively avoid this post office. Everything here takes twice as long than at any other branch. The staff is indifferent, slow (they lack even basic typing skills), and unhelpful. Their manager regularly shouts orders at them from her office. The time I decided had to be my last visit, I could hear the manager disciplining an employee by yelling at them at the top of her lungs. The entire lobby could hear. The facility is run down and unpleasant. If you can avoid this place, do it.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>I'm very unhappy with the delivery service I get here. I have had mail suppose to be delivered that day and it would not be in the mailbox. It would show up three or four days later riped up and dirty. I have also had a home medical test that had to be sent back to the lab and it took todays. for the mailman to pick it up so it was fineing pick up and the silly milkman took it next door and put with the junk mail at my neighbors apartments.If it wasn't for them my lab test would n't of made to the lab to see if I had cancer.  We have a mailman pick and choose s what mail gets delivered, or not all.
Its a dam shame. I use to go to that post office when I was a little girl. No problem at the post office or delivers. Now that I'm in my fifties I give the delivery service a BIG FAT F !!!Its 6:36 pm Sat where is is my mail !!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I have been to this post office numerous times now and have had very good experiences.  I was mailing multiple priority envelopes internationally and, although the process is time consuming, the staff does a very good job of handling it while balancing other customer needs as well.  All of the staff members that I've interacted with have been very friendly and professional. As post offices go, I would definitely recommend this one.</text>

<Text>It's incredible that a government office can get away with what this Post Office does on a regular basis. Check out the Yelp!reviews if you think I am exaggerating. This office DOES NOT ANSWER THE PHONE. Even if you receive a slip from your carrier telling you to call and providing the number, it does not matter. This office DOES NOT ANSWER THE PHONE. Lost packages are a common occurrence and when one escalates the call to the Regional Supervisor, you are told not to feel bad, it happens to a lot of people. Lost packages? In fairness, the staff often doesn't have time to answer your phone call, they are very busy bring either bored or surly or both with the walk-in customers. Yet nothing changes year after year. It really does feel like walking into the Twilight Zone just to buy a stamp.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Deplorable customer service!!  If you can avoid coming here, you should.  It seems as if the employees do not care about their customers and just work to collect their checks.  I have had way too much problems with this particular station.  If I can rate it a zero, I would do it in a heartbeat.  I think today is my last time coming here.  Just awful!!<//Review>< response>

Highly doubting if anyone actually works in this building. My package has just been sitting in their building for over 2 days. My package must be lost, which you'd think a business operating for as long as they have would have a decent organizational system. Don't bother calling either. It's just a waste of your time.</Review>

I'm calling (yes literally still on hold as I'm writing this review) for a simple answer about mailbox availability and though my call was answered almost immediately. I was put on hold so she could check for me....my current hold time in now just over 22 minutes. This is ridiculous. How long does it take to check mailbox vacancy? I'm positive the staff does not have to manually check every single mailbox to see if its in use. Though with this hold time you would think so. Going on 25 minutes now.</Review>

This post office is the pits!!!!  It's in the middle of the neighborhood yet they're are always busy.  I've trying to reach someone there for over two hours and it's always busy!  Yet if I go in there's maybe 2-3 people in line!

And this issue in regarding delivery.  I got a Sorry We Missed You! notice.  It states that they tried to contact me, but they never did!  I was home all day and I never got a knock on the door or a doorbell ring!  I live in an apartment and it's not like I can't hear it either.

Just ad this up to other complaints I have regarding these guys!!!!!!<//text>

This probably the worst of the worst post office that I’ve been to. Avoid this place like a plague. Customer service doesnt exist anymore. Lazy POS deliver my packages instead of giving notices. To lazy to deliver packages if its bigger than their brains. No wonder they are loosing business. Hoping this POS location will shut down soon. So our are will get a better usps.<//review>

This post office once ran pretty smooth, previously I had no real issues, when packages arrived that I needed to pick up at the window it was in and out in a flash. All of this was as I stated: MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH THIS POST OFFICE. THE DIFFERENCE IS STRIKING SERIOUSLY... THE DECLINE IN SERVICE, SPEED, ORGANIZATION ALL BOILS DOWN TO A CHANGE IN WHO RUNS THE PLACE NOW. IDK why things changed, why they brought in a different person to run the place, it's really unfortunate because the previous man who ran things really did excellent work. I added a description of the man so ppl knew who I was referring to just to help explain the details better.. (Tall, middle aged white guy unsure of his name hence the reasoning for my description of the previous office manager at the Pacific And. Location) So now things TAKE FOREVER, I MEAN FOREVER, I WAITED 35 MINUTES YESTERDAY BEFORE FINALLY JUST WALKING OUT,I had already waited in line a previous 15 minutes just to be told to wait for the manager who didn't even come to deal with helping to locate my package for about 25 minutes then when she did the overall customer service was non existent, not even a smile how are you, nothing, which isn't too dispersing for this area, L.B. as a whole severely lacks customer service in most of their stores, shops, food places etc. IDK if ppl are forgetting that it's because of the customers that come into their establishments that they themselves even have a job in the first place. Without customers there world be no job PERIOD. THAT GOES FOR ANY PLACE GIVING ANY TYPE OF SERVICE TO THEY PUBLIC. So it's really disappointing to go from one of the few places that is around here that really gave exceptional customer service, that was organized, incredibly helpful, and in and out fast service, to the COMPLETE & UTTER OPPOSITE TO WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED, SLOW SO SO SO SLOW THAT I LEFT STILL NOT EVEN RETURNING YET TOO RESOLVE MY LOST PACKAGE ISSUES, LACKING ANY REAL ABILITY TO BE OF ANY HELP, NOT EVEN A HELLO, HI, ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT WHAT SO EVER NOT EVEN A SMILE WOW, AND EVERYTHING SEEMED SO INCREDIBLY UNORGANIZED WHICH ONLY TRICKLED DOWN TO THE EMPLOYEES. WHEN MANAGEMENT CAME SEEM TO RUN THE PLACE IT SALLY SHOWS AMONGST THE EMPLOYEES WORKING UNDER MANAGEMENT. It was like no one could figure things out, not only with me but also with the customers I was observing while waiting my almost 40 minutes.. JUST a really poor experience. I'm hopeful that that gentlemen comes back or honestly I might just find a new place to go it's that bad..<//Text>

<review>As far as the people who are there at the window go, they're very helpful...to some extent.  I was supposed to have a package delivered and on the tracker it said it was already delivered, at my doorstep when I was home all day and nothing ever showed up.
Then I go in and talk to the people there, they said my package wasn't there and gave me the name of their supervisor so I can to talk to him.
Here, is the problem.  I talked to him, he assured me he'd get to the bottom of this, even asked for my name and phone number, and that he'd call me back with information ASAP, two days later....nothing.  No package, no phone call.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I was pulling out the trash can out for collection.  The mail lady said I had a package, yes I know I will get it in just a minute.  The she picked up the package and started reading the label. I told her it was mine please leave it alone.  She continued to read the label and feeling of the package.   It was not her mail to deliver, it was already delivered, she had no right to go through my item on my front porch.</text>< Pics>

< review>
I've had issues in the past with deliveries a few years back, but I actually found out that google maps has my address with a picture and location pointed at the wrong house (my neighbor's house). I didn't find out until quite recently.

I've sent emails in the past about misdelivered packages (with tracking numbers) a long time ago and they actually did better! I left a note on my mailbox about leaving packages right at my door because I've had a package stolen by a passerby even though I was home all day. It was frustrating back then. The usps people who deliver to my place no longer misdeliver my packages or leave them in the open for theft. They knock before leaving a package, which I greatly appreciate.

The delivery people are nice enough and the post office people have not been rude when I make a mistake or want to deliver/pick up something.

If they get temps around the holidays, I wouldn't be surprised with misdeliveries since they are not acquainted with my address.

Anyway, I'm really happy with their service and have been for quite a while now. They are very responsive through email. Calling hasn't been the best experiences, but not the worst, and as long as you are nice they will work with you. I'm sure they work really hard and have been through a lot.< /review>

We have multiple Packages that was suppose to be delivered today and like with all orders we the customers (Pay* for Shipping and Handling). As a customer we should have our packages on the day it's suppose to be Delivered*. We track all orders because of the INCOMPETENTS that work for the USPS* again and again they keep proving to us that they don't have the ability to do the simplest of tasks, Deliver My Package!. isn't it your job?. Stop pretending and falsifying that you left any type of notice at the door, just leave me a message on my tracking history that you messed up, like you usually do....

Nothing is going to change and I know me leaving this message doesn't affect anything, but I just want people to know don't trust these people with your valuables.
Track, hunt down your package and if you have to... get insurance.

By the way why would you deliver 1 out of 2 package?
and claim you left a notice?
"UPS" Delivered 1 out of 1.

USPS needs to change to POS!...

I will have my cameras ready for you next time.

My package says out for Delivery*. I just talked to your Carrier and he says No package today
1-19-2016 6:15PM everything is delayed.... Why is your system falsifying information.<//Text>

<review>They lost my phone i send back to my insurance, they said it was never scan correctly. So there wasn't any evidence it was there in their facility but even gave me a tracking number which was invalid. They send me to the other office by redondo i believe and they said i had ro deal with the office on pacific. Where they lost it, so i end up paying still for my insurance the phone that was damage that the post office lost. And it's been months and yet package never appear and can't even filled a complain or refund since it was never scan properly by them 😔</review>< Pics>

Was here for the City of Cypress 10k/5k race in July and it was a nice area. The police station is right next door, in the same building. There is a lot of shade and parking here, with grass in the front. Easy to see from the street and the directions led me right to it. You can get in from either corner, too.</Text>

<review>Professionalisms at it’s best! If you are looking for a car lot that will help get you approved for not a ok car but a great car! Go see Jimmy at Car Tag USA I am very particular on what I like & here all the vehicles are professionally detailed cleaned. This is not your average used car lot every employee here makes this car lot function at its best from sales man to auto detailer to mechanic any questions/issues are catered to & taken care of. Go here if you too have high expectations you will not be disappointed!<//review>< Pictures>

Not trustworthy, not informative about inventory, test drove a truck that needed desperate repair work and I am not even a mechanic. I drove 1 1/2 hours to this place and felt so relieved that I walked away without purchasing a vehicle, esp. after reading these reviews (which I should have done first, whew, I dodged a bullet) they need to remove the USA from their name. Stay away and if you don't, good luck.</Text>

The owners Javier and Jacob are fantastic. They always have a revolving inventory of very nice clean pre-owned cars. All of their vehicles without exception are very very high quality and very clean vehicles. They're very picky and selective on what they allow on their lot. Two of the most straightforward and honest individuals I've ever known or and work with<//review>

The dealership makes all the other ones in kern county look like dumpsters because Car Tag USA is god tier compared to all the clowns you see waving signs of there “cheap used and cheap brand new “ deals, they just do 100$ off and call that a “deal” Car Tag USA gives legitimate deal and with legitimate and reasonable people . Overall best dealership in kern county.<//Text>

Not real trustworthy. I contacted them three times about a truck. Told them I was coming twice on a Saturday to look at the truck
Showed up at 9am no one there
No one answered phone
Finally got a hold of someone 45 mins later only to be told the truck I was going to look at was still in a repair shop
I drove two hours and even told them days prior I was doing so</text>

< Review>
Very sketchy dealership. I had messaged Danny Ramirez about going in and purchasing a vehicle after several messages we scheduled an appointment. even though I had an appointment I wanted to check before I left because I had a 1hr drive he said that the appointment was still on. when I finally arrived I started looking at the vehicle I was interested in only to my amazement that he had sold it 1hr before I got there. He thought he could lie to me and still make me drive all that way so he can sell me a vehicle that I did not care for. from my experience with cartag all I can say they seemed very shady. I would not suggest buying from them. the bad rep used car dealers get is mainly because of dealerships like these.<//Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><review>NEVER AGAIN. If I could put 0 stars I would.

-My husband got a truck from here & put a good down payment. Andy, (the finance manager) told my husband he was already approved & let him drive off with the truck. Andy made up a contract with my husband, which they both signed. Andy also made my husband sign an Arbitration form to mediate and come to an agreement before any legal actions are taken. The next day, Danny, (the salesman) called my husband and told him that he was not approved. Andy then asked for more money down. My husband gave $1500.00 more down on top of what he had already put down in the beginning. Come to find out, Danny or Andy never submitted any paperwork to any finance companies to get my husband approved. Andy told my husband that he needed to put $4500-$6000 down to get approved to “show the banks commitment.” Andy & Danny gave my husband the run-around to try to get him to go get approved on his own. (My husband STILL had the truck at this point.) My husband was having a hard time getting approved because for one, the truck has high miles, and second because the truck was valued at less than their sale price. My husband tried to get them to come down on the price, but they denied. It has been more than 4 months & my husband is still having trouble getting approved & still, Andy & Danny are asking for more money down. Recently, my husband received a phone call from Danny threatening to take the truck back or $1500 more down. Which breaks the contract that Andy & my husband signed on their behalf.

-I KNOW my husband has not been late on any payments as far as the contract he signed with Andy.

-About 2-3 days after my husband got the truck, he took the truck in because it had only 3% oil life left, (which means CarTag did not service their vehicle before they sold it) & the Service Brake System light was on. When he took it in, Andy & the mechanics wanted my husband to buy the oil & parts to fix the truck. They claimed to have fixed the service brake system, but 4 months later, it still turns on.

WE WILL NOT BE BUYING ANOTHER VEHICLE FROM THIS UNPROFESSIONAL “DEALERSHIP” AGAIN.< /review>< Pictures>

< review>
Real sketchy went in to see a truck I saw online in person because it didn't have the miles so when I got there and saw the miles I checked it in the Kelly blue book and it was suggested for alot less than it was priced on line and when I spoke to the sales person I asked what was the asking price he gave me a price that was even higher than the price they had online so I said no and left...I got a bad vibe from the place so I honestly wouldn't buy a car from there and I would suggest anyone to do their research before making a deal there</review>

Purchased vehicle from this place a month ago. Had to take in twice for repairs, have yet to see if repairs were really made. Guys named helter and jacob are scams. They never return phone calls. They lie and blame everything on eachother, never give you a straight or honest answer. Most unprofessional business I ever dealt with. If you get a car with no issues your lucky. Me not so much. Shop elsewhere, plenty of good places here in Bakersfield, this is not one of them. Terribly disappointed with my purchase.<//Review>

I purchased a 2015 Camaro from Car Tag USA and I could not be happier with my experience with this dealership. I live in St.Louis and was helped by Helder. He was extremely helpful throughout the whole process and did everything he could to help get the deal done!!!  I would not hesitate on using this dealership again!< /Review>

<Text>A friend of mines took his truck in to get some work done on his truck .not only in my opinion the took advantage of him (he's slightly mentally challenged) but they stole from him . this is my opinion from the facts I've been presented verbally and physically. They were to see if the heads needed repair .they dismantled the engine told him he needed a new one .at the time they should of put his truck back the  way they received it cause he didn't have the money to do repairs and had him women get his vehicle .so the vehicle is in the possession for some time .I guess they go back and forth trying to come up with a solution .fast forward my friend is driving down the road sees his truck on the side of the road hood in the bed no motor just the block all the wires cut battery missing which was new the exhaust cut .its like they had no intention on repairing his vehicle .they or somebody took off what they wanted and left it there .the vehicle was in a&k possession for repairs to to that point not returned to the owner .they have dealt with my friend before and over charged him on prior repair job .  I just feel that they took advantage of him in my opinion. So be aware of your dealings</Text>< Date>

A & K Towing did an amazing job when I had an issue with my CV axle. My car had to be towed after hours to their shop but they were very accommodating. They performed the work on time and their work was very professional and thorough. Thanks Praveen and Chris for doing an exceptional job and being upfront about what to expect. I highly recommend them and their exceptional service.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Terrible service! their towing service should be ridiculed and revoked!! Do not use their towing service, Geico informed me they will not be using their services anymore. I reached out to them after waiting 2 hours, a male informed me their tow truck will be there in 15 minutes, I call 40 minutes later and the receptionist tells me I was never in their system, a blatant  lie. They canceled on me without informing anyone. They then  deliberately lie to me saying I WAS NEVER IN THEIR SYSTEM! Geico informed me they canceled 2 hours after they mentioned their dispatcher would be at my car in 15 minutes.  I have never complained/ critiqued online about any service or establishment but this has to be shared. DO NOT USE THEIR SERVICE, Geico customers be aware.  Geico rep mentioned A&K will be dropped from their vendor list. What a day wasted.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

My car broke down, and Robert was dispatched to tow it yesterday.  He was polite, professional, and so kind towards my 4 year old son.  He showed him how the levers work, and let him be part of the whole process.  I would highly recommend their towing services.</Text>

<text>Got a call from the mechanic shop that the repairs on my car were finished, so I called A&K towing to two the car back to my house (car was not ready to be driven on street). I got to the shop at the same time of the tow truck, but the car wasn't ready to leave the shop (a bit of miscommunication with mechanic). I had to tell the tow truck driver that I won't be needing their service, The mechanic also explain the reasons to the driver. I was ready to pay for the tow or at lease a service charge (it would be understood). Driver call the office and they didn't charge me anything.... I felt very graceful; the repairs on my car were very expensive and at that point every saving was good. This was my second time using this company and they were the one taking the car to the shop in the first place.
So,... Thanks very much for your graceful gesture!!!
Also among their awesome service, their price was the most reasonable!!< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Excellent job of excellent people. I got my car fixed few months ago and another one just a week ago. My first shop visit, the owner Praveen made a great job simplifying by replacing just the stripped wheel bolt, instead of the whole wheel assembly, resulting to a reasonable cost. My second visit a week ago, Mr Praveen, made a good AC diagnosis for free on my Honda. He takes care of his customers the best way possible.
I highly recommend this shop for all of Customer's car problems.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

A&K towing towed my Scion FR-S yesterday and took it to a shop of my choice. I have never had such a great experience with a towing company EVER. the owner of the company himself came to help me out and was very humble , polite, educated and was clearly all about customer service. He assured me that he would get to the shop safe and timely. When we got to the shop he shook my hand and thanked me for my time. It surprised me because of how respectful he was. Simply a man that genuenly wants his business to do well by quality and honest work. I will 100% give them a call for a tow and if I ever need work done on a car. These guys will help you out without a doubt in my mind and more importantly they will give you an honest quote and will not waste your time nor will they up the price for anything. I’d give them 10 starts if possible.</review>

Mario was my tow service provider,  he took extra care in handling my beautiful 18 year old BMW E39 and putting her on the flatbed like a champ!  I couldn’t have asked for a more professional tow service. Thank you Mario and the rest of the team at A&K towing.  These folks aren’t rude like some other tow companies!  Highly recommend! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

<Review>Jesus, a member of A&K,  is very friendly and passionate about what he does. He has helped me pulling the car out of the garage and assisted me to take the car to the designated location. He updated his location status while on his way and engaged in conversations with you to make you smile. Very quick responses and highly recommended to anyone in need of towing services.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< Pictures>

I needed roadside assistance through Liberty Mutual.  They sent one of their trucks from A&K.  The truck took twice as long as the ETA said.  He even had to stop for gas before coming to assist me.  That is unacceptable.  Terrible service as well.  AAA would never take that long.<//review>

This is the best auto shop in town and so I had a broken Nissan Maxima engine that needed to get fixed and so I went to A&K repair and towing shop and one of the employees Chris helped me get my car fixed in no time and successfully replaced my engine with a whole new engine and now my car is running Great! I recommend Families and Friends to get there cars fixed to all your car problems no matter the make or model of your car at this shop and asked for Chris he will make sure your car will get fixed ASAP!!< /review>

My radiator pooped out on me last month and when I called my insurance agent they recommended A&K Towing...they were so reasonable and were out at my house within the half hour....Praveen the owner was the one that showed up and was so helpful and friendly and got the job done in no time... I will always use A&K for all my towing needs and to recommend to all my friends and acquaintances...Thank you A&K Towing!</Text>

I had a very bad experience when needing road service the time b4. I did everything I could do so I wouldn't have to make that call. Eventually called & dreaded what tow company & technician would be sent. Jesus showed up and was so professional. He really helped me & my grandson.

He made us feel like he genuinely cared that we were cold, wet & been scared waiting at night. I hope I can get him everytime in the future should I need roadside help again. He went beyond the call of duty with his help and kindness. He reinstilled the trust I had lost.</Review>< time>

Praveen was amazing. Locked myself out of my car and despite complicated security system, he was not going to be stopped in getting the car unlocked.
Saved me.
You can call A & K Towing with great confidence. Thanks Praveen.</text>

My car would not start and I thought it had to do with battery. I called AnK Towing and spoke to Praveen who is the owner and he immediately came within 20 min. He was very professional, extremely personable and knowledgably that he took extra time to look into my car and help provide his insights from having a mechanic background. I would definitely use AnK Towing for all my future services. He is truly knows what he is doing as both a mechanic and a towing service....his quality is of a very high grade. Thank you so much Praveen!<//Review>

Praveen Chand, A and K Towing owner, and his employee Jesus saved my day.  Their professionalism, friendliness, and very competitive pricing made the necessity of needing a tow for my pickup truck a much better experience.  Thank you!  I definitely recommend A and K Towing.< /text>

I took it back 1 week later and was told it was leaking oil and that I ran all the oil out, but I jad no oil on the ground where I parked my car. Praveen changed the oil plug but now my van consistently leaks oil. I am positive they forgot to put the oil in from the oil change and now my vehicle engine is damaged forever. I also had 3 catalytic converters changed and now my car rattles on acceleration and my engine light came back on within a month of having this work done. Never again will I take anything here< /Text>< Time>

I called my insurance company and they stated a hour and 15 min wait for tow service then the guy calls me back and states it would be 60 mins and I told him about my gate  was a closed community and access is limited the contacted AnK tow company and the guy on the phone was very polite and decent and reported that my driver would be there in 10 mins far off from what my insurance said but very impressed with time schedule the driver was excellent and very hard working his name was jesus<//review>

<Review>This is the second time I have used A&K Towing.
The first time I called a few tow companies and found them to be the most reasonbly priced and friendly.
This second time my Insurance company chose A&K Towing.
Both times I found them friendly and professional.
I would reccommend the to everyone!</Review><GmapID>0x80855bfc453c8a3f:0x7d8e25e1e4b4fd5e<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>A&K is the ONLY tow company y'all should use.
They are the kind of company that sees the big picture. I believe that if they, for some reason, could'nt  solve your problem, they would help you solve other way.

<text>Good Filipino food and pastries. Kinda pricey. I like coming here especially if I need to shop for Asian ingredients in the main store itself. So convenient.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>While unassuming, the desserts where great. Wasn't expecting to find a good bakery inside a grocery store, but wow! The three things we tried were great, all new experiences.  The staff was prompt,  courteous and kind. Will most definitely be visiting them again in the near future.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
This is the bakery inside of the Rachno 88 Asian Goods store.  The bakery is awesome with all kinds of traditional breads fresh-baked daily.  Also has hard to find traditional pastries and desserts.  I got some kind of tofu thing floating in syrup.  It was delicious.  The bread is really where it's at though.  Just amazing.<//review>

Totally great place to spend a morning or afternoon, or the whole day.

Plants, trees, and flowers that you won't see often unless you do a lot of world wide traveling.

My wife and I spent the afternoon stopping and gawking at the wonderful plants.  We were here on the 21st of November and the fall colors were also glorious.

A fun place to use an app to help identify flowers and leaves.

The only drawback was the lack of bathroom facilities and drinking water.</text>

We like to go out to UC Davis a couple times a year to check out the plants and enjoy the college campus. During covid this was wonderful, plenty of space to sit in green grass and relax or walk along the water to spot turtles and various birds. Our kids enjoyed seeing the horses, cows and llamas as well. Great way to spend an afternoon.< /text>

Nice design. Started at the western end and saw so many varieties of oaks. We had no idea there were so many, and we still would not if they hadn't taken the time to mark them; and not with little metal stakes or tags. No, the markers in this part of the arboretum were talented art installations of ceramic on concrete.
Then we went on around the pond. All the other plants are marked, though not with the same flare.
Altogether we walked 2.5 miles, but we could have walked further.
At the eastern end of the pond is a "creek." At that point there is a bridge that we didn't cross, and there are more as the path meanders along the water.
The bridges are located frequently enough that if one begins to regret not crossing over at the last one to begin the return to their car, there will be another coming along soon thereafter.
It made a beautiful after lunch walk.< /text>

<text>The arboretum is one of those zen like places that allow you to regroup and reconnect with nature. Although next the UC Davis, you'd hardly notice it. Family friendly and relaxing. Also, it's an idealic place for photography.<//text>< Pictures>

I celebrated my graduation earlier this evening in this fine place. I am glad to say that we passed a brilliant evening and the restaurant was unquestionably one of the reasons for the happy gathering. The crew  collaborated in a gorgeous way, the cooking was extremely good and my guests were so  joyful. We shall no dout return for more celebrations. thanks very much.< /Text>

Horrible, 3 people working, and 1 manager, 14 people waiting for their order to be done. Receipt shows 1 p.m., no orders to go have been called, it is 1:20 p.m.. Worst experience ever, and lunchtime is already over. Completely unorganized. Pictures depict the situation of people waiting with no takeout food in site.< /Review>

<review>Depends on the day. Sometimes you get fast service and the right food, but mostly either the wrong food or slow service. Staff is super friendly though.</review>< Pictures>

Waited over 30 minutes for tacos. Could have gone to the commissary, bought the ingredients, cooked them all and made my own faster.< /text>

The slowest service I've seen. Been standing in line for more then 10 minutes now, they still haven't taken my order. Would give negative stars if possible.< /Review>

Though I have never actually dined at this location, I thoroughly enjoy watching it's mobile activity on Google Maps.    The downside is, by the time I drive there, it is sure to have been moved...and we'd have to settle for JJ's "nasty" Mexican food.  From what I read, that isn't worth the drive!<//Text>

I always hated the term "Hidden gem" but this place is exactly that; fresh fish, healthy portions, affordable prices, and the nicest sushi chefs ever. Tucked away in a quiet strip mall right off the 15, it really is a hidden gem.</Text>

<Time>1495443059721</Time><Review>The fish was well priced and fresh. The restaurant is on the smaller side. We had a fairly large sized party of 8 people (7 adults and one infant) we squeezed in but it didn't leave much room for others. Staff was a little too relaxed. Had to keep getting their attention even though it was not to busy during our visit.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmWh6biryWfVzdRiqRFb1lnNK4hipNFLAQBKp5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyE1Qmid8Rta7X-0QwPCJ76oeRqQ06GNtK2USH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures></record>

Been coming here for over 5 years. Was absolutely shocked to place an order to go half an hour before close..to be hung up on. There's plenty of other sushi businesses that will gladly take my business. Very disappointing.< /review>

<Review>Delicious! The Chiba noodle soup was wonderful & comes with gyoza, shrimp tempura,  a small salad & is filled with good things like chicken, fish cake, surimi, & snaky udon noodles. My son had Ginger Chicken that also came with lots of delicious things! Just yummy!</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRzliIH3ni9NRofMDfc1iZeimrnwQQKpyp5zub=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkK6kNqisWmByxGT6NTFlmgZrLEQOIZydoorvX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM8Y72vgDTdE2pm6IReR0rf4z69l4kEFoDJp-Hw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfB8YZqHS0tFBsM3jcepuzwBm4Oc-O6-D4XsR5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOF2Axwascn0iYPjUxMAdtxE8ac0ZXdeD5Bxr9R=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

Dynamite roll to die for! Its our go to sushi place.  Fresh sushi everytime we have gone.  I also appreciate that their rolls aren't ridiculously overpriced allowing their patrons to enjoy quality sushi at a fair price. Go early as their is limited seating and parking.< /review>

Solid hole in the wall Japanese food. Great service from the waitress. They have Japanese beer in both big and small bottles so it makes the experience damn good. Nothing beats a Sopporro and sushi. They have a pretty good lunch deal. A must if your into hole in the wall Asian places. They do take out so there is a lot of people who do that. For me it's all about having a beer at the sushi bar and a couple rolls.</text>

This spot is quaint it's a bit small but it's cozy it's Monday daughter's favorite spot I've enjoyed it on occasion and we've actually held her 21st birthday party there. The sake served hot or cold and then wasabi is good and the prices are really cost effective.</Text>

This is my go to spot for fresh fish and tasty rolls.  Service could be a little better as it gets busy they are less attentive.  Food order comes out a little scattered too.  Decent place for a party of 4-6.  Anything larger can get awkward.<//text>

Awesome food, kind staff. The teriyaki chicken is very good and so is the sushi. The location location is a little hidden and parking is at least easy but I do like his place.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I come here frequently because the staff are kind and genuine. The food is extremely tasty and affordable. I like the variety that they have and the option to use soy paper instead of seaweed in their sushi rolls. I usually order the special A which comes with chicken teriyaki, salad with citrus sauce, small appetizer, and rice. If I'm feeling particularly hungry, I also order the Las Vegas Roll, which is one of their premium rolls and I usually don't see this roll at other places. So it is a unique and tasty restaurant that I highly recommend you try.</review>< Pictures>

I'm starting to strongly dislike this place as they are cheap liars. Their menu always describes a roll with it fillings a topping and when you get it it all most never has the topping sauces. The first time I thought it was just forgotten , but now I realize they are just ripping off their customers , I've been dumb enough to let this fly over 3 times over the past 2 years but im totally over it. Never coming back.... They have a right to change their items and ingredients, but they've had more than enough time to take it off the menu but they don't the leave it there and mislead people and serve you a dry ass roll. Don't get me wrong, I love all sushi, nigiri, sashimi, all of it ....but when I want a crazy smothered " fun" roll and you have it listed on the menu and I'm paying for it.... You should be serving customers what they order as it reads on the menu . ...or change the menu and be cheap and tell customers they have to pay for their toppings.<//text>

My friends and I lovingly refer to this place as "No Parking Sushi", since it's next door to a popular sports bar. Best value for sushi I've found in San Diego.< /text>

Seth held an amazing succulent workshop for our workplace over Zoom. All materials came quickly and were in spectacular condition. The packaging was meticulous!! The class exuded care and passion for plants of all kinds. Bonus points for being a plant doctor to our at home plant babies that weren’t even purchased at store. Truly generous and skilled. Two of the best traits you could ever ask for in a plant guru.<//Text>

First time in this store.  I was disappointed with the succulent display inside the store until I realize they have a lot more in the back garden. I love the variety of different types of succulents and some of them I have not seen at other local stores.  There prices are very reasonable.  They range from $4 up to $16 based on their sizes.  Personally, I like to get the small ones so I can grow them myself.  I picked up 9 for a total of $40.

The staff at the store are very friendly and helpful.  They checked in with us regularly to see if we need help but they also allow us enough privacy to look around on our own.  One of the succulents I asked for was out of stock, the lady offered to take down my number and call when she has it. This kind of personal service is hard to find nowadays.   I used to go to the one on Bayshore for my succulents and other plants.  This will be my go to place for succulents from now on.< /Review>

<text>The variety of plants at this store is great but the customer service definitely leaves something to be desired. I was interested in getting a Hoya heart and mounted stag horn fern but unfortunately the woman working made me and my boyfriend feel so uncomfortable we left. Within the 10-15 minutes we were in the store she checked on us 4 times and followed us throughout the whole small store while leaving other customers unattended. I definitely did not get the feeling she was trying to be helpful and felt more like I was being watched. I’m an avid gardener and collector and I was really excited to add some of your plants to my collection but unfortunately I didn’t feel welcomed in your store.< /text>< Pics>

{'time': 1611420709165, 'text': 'Hi Camilla, I’m so sorry we made you feel that way. Our customer service style is to make sure we are giving our attention to everyone in the store, but definitely not to make you feel like we are stalking you! I’m super sorry that happened and would definitely like to personally welcome you through the shop if you would ever choose to come back. The pandemic has definitely cramped our style a bit and we are working on it daily. I hope you give us another chance. Feel free to contact me on by email to share more about your experience so that we can learn from it. -Ken'}</resp>

<text>Great spot for succulents, air plants, and terrarium supplies in general. They have hanging pots, wall planters, and medium sized pots. For terrariums they have all kinds of glass containers. They also have sheet moss and different colored dyed moss. And of course, So. Many. Succulents. Prices are reasonable as well.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Their succulent workshops are so fun! Also a great place to find a gift or supplies for planting your own succulents. Knowledgeable and friendly... Definitely worth a trip to Bernal Heights.<//review>

I decided to use an old glass jar to do a terrarium and than realized stay at home didn't make it easy to shop for plants so googled and made an appointment for a FaceTime shopping consultation and between a very helpful call to help me pick out a plant that would work, soil, and moss plus curbside pickup I got some life in an under corner of my living room during that makes me happy!<//review>

<text>This place is so cute! Perfect for a fun and interactive date. You can build your own terrariums or plant plants in all sorts of containers. You can bring your own container and/or plant if you want and just pay to plant it at the plant bar. They provide soil and rocks and decor for your planter as well included with the planter bar fee ($10 for a 4” container, add $2 per inch I think is the pricing).

They also have classes for more advanced vertical planters as well as basic classes. You can go in and just buy plants if you want. There’s a big selection. They also sell salt lamps, soaps, water bottles, socks, and other knick knacks.

The woman who assisted us (I think her name was Eye), was so so friendly and helpful. Can’t wait to come back for a class with my friends!

I didn’t end up planting in the store for lack of time, but here is my final product in the photo. I got the bulbasaur planters on amazon and the plants from Succulence.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuaTZXkcuuyeiTgC7NhGs5JfgB458ukKbRA0nE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIrHH36JyCZZ7_7pKk8psiDAn_jblKzX33Re6n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1bjPmBxvfFRwe1yoxopZXQqPSu6MpWp13_KgS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

One of the best selections of specifically succulents in San Francisco. They’re kinda expensive, but they have a great stock and helpful staff. Expect to spend a sizable sum if you go here.<//text>

What a place for succulent fans! I feel like in heaven of succulent when I stepped in the backyard garden.

And we had so much fun in the terrarium building class.

Our instructor went over the steps on how to make terrarium detailedly. We can choose up to 4 succulence and any kind of sand, stones, and moss. We also went through the predilection of each kind of succulent that we selected and learn how to take care of them.

We have a wonderful experience here and definitely will come back for the cute little succulents and plants.<//text>

<Review>Shop has a nice selection of plants that appeared healthy even in wintertime. The place has a slightly uppity vibe as compared to other floral shops I have been to and no one spoke to us until we were ready to pay. I am super happy with the plants that my SO and I purchase though!<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f7e5959ad85a7:0x63c4d87dbc4c93bb< /gmapID></record>

Just got off of the phone with Dan who I believe is the manager. I needed some advice on best practices for care on my late Grandmother's succulent I inherited. He was knowledgeable, friendly, and very willing to listen to be ramble on. I have to say it is rare to find such great customer service especially when it is over the phone. I havent even been into the shop yet and I already know I want to give these guys my future business.</Text>

I love to gas up at this location. This Succulence has the cheapest gas in the San Francisco (30022) area. The price today (Jan. 8th) was $3.01.  :)  I would totally recommend getting gas here. And I would also recommend getting your car washed here as well since they also have one of the cheapest prices.<//Text>

This was a beautiful store with a wide selection but unfortunately they sold me a fern that was infested with thrips and spidermites. Luckily I kept the plant away from my other plants so I didn't get an infestation but now it's sadly been banished to the porch where it'll probably die b/c the temperature is a little too low for the poor guy. I really thought a plant from a specialty store like this would've been better cared for. Buyer beware.<//text>

Cool place for a variety of succulents & plants. They also carry an assortment of big planters as well, but not many options for single sized smaller plants. Knowledgeable staff. Parking was easy. Nice neighborhood.<//Text>

<Review>I live on the east coast and was looking for a fun gift idea for a friend’s 30th who lives out in SF. Got her a gift card for the terrarium classes. I had some special requests for my order and the staff was excellent and responsive. Shout out to Harrison who was very kind and accommodating. Would definitely recommend them!< /Review>< pics>

<review>This place is really nice. I went there looking for plant pots and was really pleased with the selection. I looked at some of the house plants and the prices were comparable to places like Armstrong. They have a good selection of indoor and outdoor plants. Definitely will be back.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Succulence as the name implies is a store filled with succulent goodies. Goodies ranging from art work, to decorations, to various succulents, and colorful moss!

Perhaps my obsession for succulents has gotten out of hand, but I could spend the whole day in this tiny shop. On select days, they offer classes on making terrariums which I highly suggest because they're fun to do :)

If I was rich, I'd probably buy the place out. But since I'm not, I'll settle with just a sea urchin shell, plant glue and purple moss for now. Yes, their stuff is a little bit pricey than the average, but they have items that are hard to find anywhere else.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

A tiny bit out of the range I would normally pay for a succulent but an excellent selection. I've been here multiple times, mostly for the selection, and it really depends on who is there for the quality of service and advice they can offer but overall I would go back, especially since I have educated myself no thanks to an employee from my last visit.</text>

<rating>5</rating><text>I have never. Let me finish that statement-I have never been more captivated with a life and garden store. From the moment you walk in you are greeted with smiles, not just from the genuine owners but from the neighbors themselves!

Succulence sits atop Bernal Heights surrounded by a beautiful culture that is driven by the community-for the community. Upon arrival to Succulence, Ken, the store owner who adorned with vibrant hair and eye catching style was eager to simply have a conversation. Selling anything to help boost your garden to even quirky gifts of how to grow a compostable pizza, Succulence is just perfect!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<rating>4< /rating><text>So this place isn't that far from me, and I stopped in to see about their plant workshops and to try and learn to take better care of my aloe vera plant. They have some classes that I haven't signed up for yet, but will, and the owner seems really knowledgeable. Despite the name, they also have some other plants that are not succulents, though succulents (think cacti and other "juicy" plants) are their main focus. The store has a big selection and keeps most types of cactuses (cacti?) in stock year round. What a gem of store right in my city. Some of their customizable options for creating decor for your home are really cool.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808f7e5959ad85a7:0x63c4d87dbc4c93bb< /gmapID></record>

The store itself--awesome.  Great selection of succulents and succulent accessories, including terrariums, hanging pots, and even tiny succulent necklaces.  Prices seem to be slightly cheaper than at Flora Grubb.  Succulence gets only 3 stars, though, because the service was pretty poor.  I was in the back room putting together a sort of potting kit for my housemate, and while the associate would say things like "let me know if you need any help," when I'd ask questions, he'd give me short answers as if I was asking stupid questions.  I had already told him that I wasn't very knowledgeable about this stuff, so no need to treat me like I'm stupid.  Overall I felt really uncomfortable around him.  The woman at the cash register, who seemed to be a manager, was much nicer and more helpful; just wish she was the one in the back helping customers out.</review>

So I'm building a camper van and everything about my van is a little different and technical, I wanted a back up heat and cooling source inside of the van ,power bye the engine, they were able to set me up with exactly what I wanted. Witch was above  and beyond most install, at no extra charge.  I don't think they made money on me at all , due to the extra but I'll be back for sure

Grate guys willing to go above and beyond< /Text>

These guys are amazing. They wired my alarm  and stereo equipment flawlessly. They had to make a small hole for one of the knobs, and I am so grateful they asked before making any holes, then they found the best spot for it. I cannot tell you how highly I would recommend this shop. They tinted my windows as well and the whole thing looks great. They have great prices and are so helpful and customer oriented. I appreciate the fact they answered all my questions, even though they have probably heard them hundreds of times. Thanks guys!</review>

Jay and Rylan at Cartronix do an excellent job. They can do about anything involving car stereos or nav systems...including custom work if needed. They have tons of knowledge and everything they do is done professionally and on time. If you want a job done right, they are the ones to do it!

Would highly recommend them and will be using them in the future when needed! =)</review>

Fantastic guys working at this place. They're very knowledgeable and helped me replace my car's dash stereo to one with Bluetooth and more power. Pricing was better than I expected, but I'm not sure what most of the components normally go for in the first place. I'll be going back to them for my next upgrade.<//Text>

<Date>1376812814301<//Date><text>They are very nice and have great customer service. They have amazing resources to look up the parts they need. Everything about them is perfect Sept for one problem. They only carry up to date kits. So just about any car before this years models have to the frame and its stereo harness ordered. Granted the when they order parts it takes a max of 2 business days. Some people just don't want to wait. So if you want a quality job done go here and if you need to have them order something do the waiting. Because they do great work.< /text><rating>5< /rating><UserId.>115092189863526012851< /UserId.><name>Seth Sawyer< /name>< gmap_id>

Only been there to talk about what I'm looking for in a car audio system so far. But was amazed by their knowledge. They carry some of the best brands for audio system and the have all tools need to install and tune your system. They were willing to look at my car and tell me what I need for free to help me out. Thats what I call great service. It shows that they are not in it for make a sale. They are their to help a customers. If you want a quality work and quality equipment this is the place to go. Thank you< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>After being utterly disregarded/ignored at "audio enhancers" (prior customer of 4 yrs) from only sporadic, gentle inquiries regarding minor & quick wire checkup, & later not having success getting in sync with workloads of other local shops, i was gonna toss in towel & take my business out of the city.  my last attempt was here, as a WALK-IN, entered this shop first time ever, greeted warmly & h778k9fternoon, was called & squeezed in for what turned out to be quick, well done, honest service.  and most impressively, i was given an impromptu detailed explanation/troubleshooting commentary about cause of & care of saix, which i appreciated very much.   my bill, in my opinion, did not reflect the quality of overall experience, & tried offering more, but was humbly declined.  managed to leave $5 tip before leaving, very satisfied & impressed by the all-around A+ service, & obviously recommends them over any other shop, who (may/may not) caters to a certain demographic.<//Review>< Pics>

<rating>1</rating><text>Absolutely the WORST hotel I have ever been to. Do not, under any circumstances, stay here... especially if you have kids.
The staff was absolutely rude and disrespectful and there was so much gang activity/ drug dealing/ noise/ etc.
We ended up not staying. The hotel staff cancelled our reservations, unbeknownst to us, but it was a blessing in disguise as we probably would have been killed in our sleep or got bed bugs. Reading others reviews after the fact, I am beyond thankful they screwed up our reservations.<//text>< Pics>

When I called to get a price on the room the lady asked for how many people, I said for 1, so she said $75 for the night. So I get there, it’s been a long day, I’m not feeling well, so I park my car, I then proceed register and I need to be buzzed in. There’s a bunch of middle eastern men in the small room were registration counter is at, but since he said that the $75 was without the taxes, I was so ready to walk right back out the door, but interrupted me by saying that if I paid cash then he could keep it at $75. So I stayed until checkout time which is 10am, which sucks.<//review>

<text>Worst place I've ever stayed in my life, when I went to check in the front they were so disrespectful and unprofessional.Then when I got to my motel there was blood on the door and on the bedding , also someone wrote all over the walls , the ceiling was falling in the bathroom. Alot of drug dealing going on . When checking out the lady was disrespectful.  Oh ! and I had to sleep with my sweater cause the bedding was disgusting had blood and holes in the blankets . I never make reviews on places I stay but ive never seen anything like this.  Dont stay here . It's not anything like the ad says .</text><user>101628461038791381428< /user>< Name>

There was loud music playing, had no working cable only Wi-Fi and that went out couldn't watch any tv after that, I asked for an extra pillow I got that but not a pillow case for it.

<Review>This hotel is the filthiest place ever! I really don’t know why Orbitz would even recommend this dump. The rooms are disgusting, bed covers had holes in them with burnt marks, they look like they don’t even change the bedding. Nothing but criminal activity going on all over the place. Just horrible.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

Hotel is unsanitary and has too much structural issues to be open for business. The internet is so bad I could barely even load up my email , the clerk couldn’t even confirm my reservation because she said she had no internet either. they spent some money remodeling the bathroom tile and flooring but there is noticeable mold in the drywall and rotting also.! the door was stained black like it hasn’t been cleaned in weeks, when I took my socks off entering I noticed a good amount of dirt and sediment on the floor...I wouldn’t even spend $20 for this motel< /Review>

I didn’t actually get to sleep in a room and I’m glad I didn’t.  Their front desk service stops ar 12am- after that it appears the hotel goes wild.  I saw at least 6 cars pull up and get drugs from one particular room over and over.  Crackheads walking thru on foot and bike.  Prostitutes hanging around on the balconies.  All this i observed while on hold with hotels.com for about 20 min.  Stay if you want to but don’t arrive after 12am or you won’t get your room-< /Text>

I'm almost 5 month pregnant, my pregnancy is high risk. So my husband tried to go park close so that I could check in, but right as I approached the window to check I hear a woman yelling and scolding my husband for parking and what was the"MANAGERS PARKING" we were not planning to stay parked there. If anything he always tries to find the closest parking to our room for my comfort. "The Manager's behavior and attitude was totally uncalled for, aside from that I had to go in with a bottle of bleach and cleaner to disinfect the room. Bed poorly made and it was on the first floor facing the back of the hotel with no windows screen and no windows treatments and nor security. Making it totally accessible for anyone to just jump in the window, for management behavior you would think hotel is in top notch but No! Totally ghetto people screaming and party at late hours of the night having visitors park anywhere they want. I hate the fact that "Hotels.com" being such a popular site can't do a thing for their customer when it comes to cancellations I wanted to leave to another hotel but their"Non-refundable" policy makes it totally inconvenient especially when you don't read the little lines and you end up sleeping in your car without a room that it's already been paid for. I will never stay at this hotel again.< /text>

<review>This was the WORST motel I have ever stayed in - ever in 47 years of life!  NOT for FAMILIES!!! It was gross and dirty.  There were paint splatters all over the shower - the tile, the shower curtain (which was dirty and had hard water stains on it), on the walls.  The tiles were old and dingy and looked gross. The floor mat towel was dirty.  One of the paper shampoos on that towel was empty.  There were no hangers on the rack.  The back of the door looked like it had been continuously kicked with direct boots and never cleaned.  There was a random table by the TV with missing paint and it looked dirty.  Scratches and chunks out of the laminate flooring.  The top cover and the blanket underneath had stains.  I seriously set NOTHING on the floor, slept in it for six hours because I had prepaid and there were no refunds, then I left.  I tried to check out at 9:00am and the office door was locked with no one in sight.  Oh and when I checked in, I asked if it was safe and he seemed offended.  This place is only 3 miles miles from Disneyland mostly down Ball, but it felt like another place, rows of motels and the one next door had weekly rates.  I never saw a female anywhere, only sketchy males and one hanging out in his car.  Between 12:00am and 1:00am after a long day at Disneyland someone knocked at two different times at the next room.  I think illegal activity was taking place.  Our remote had yellow duct tape on it, there were no cups or anything at all.  It was horrible.<//review><Response>None< /Response><Date>1584316800000<//Date>< user_name>

The location is so nice, considering it’s right next to Knotts Berry Farm amusement park, you’d expect clean and decent people, unfortunately not the case. Maybe due to Covid-19?

The guy in the office was nice, but the room smelled bad and there was people yelling and knocking on doors all night. The room was dirty, there were stains on the bedding and the walls were dirty. Things were broken, like the toilet paper holder. It was a little uncomfortable.</Review>

By far the most FOUL place I've ever been. There was BLOOD on the floor. Wiped up red but mostly black because the floors have NEVER been mopped. Told management and she gave nothing but attitude and lip. Sent a random lady(NOT a worker here) to come wipe the blood up. Asked her to mop and change the sheets because they have brown stains all over them. She gave me attitude and said she doesn't work here but I can go ask the manager for a mop to mop it up. She later came back with a brand new mop that she was sent to buy and "fresh" sheets which for some reason were covered in cardboard and still had huge brown stains. Worst experience of my life. Should be shut down. Non-livable. Absolutely DISGUSTING</Text>

< Review>
Has to be the worst hotel/motel I've ever stayed in. The pictures on some of the booking sites are deceiving. Aside from what you can see in the pictures in this review, there was nothing positive to say aside from the TV, which was mounted on wall. I would give if less than a star if it was possible. It is not worth what we paid and for its location, it was even more disappointing.<//Review>

Looks great for the outside but once you get inside you get really disappointed. Needs a lot of attention and repairs, and if you complain they dont really care</text>

<review>I stayed 30 minutes and left.  The worst, I mean the worst place I have ever seen in my 15 years of traveling.  The smell is horrid.  I went in to take a shower, the water smelled and then the tub over flowed.   I tried airing out the room but the stink was so horrible.  I couldn’t stay, I picked up and left to a near by hotel.  UNBEARABLE.  By the way the pictures posted on the page are fake, the rooms look nothing like that.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<text>Let me tell you about a little place called Rainbow Inn, when we first walked through the room door the horrible smell overwhelmed everyone. The bed sheets were stained and covered in cigarette burns, needing to be replaced immediately. Way too many shady characters hanging around too, did not feel very safe. Having said all of that, I will say the shower was very impressive compared to anything else in the room. The water pressure felt great and the newly remodeled shower tile were much nicer than the rest of the room. Wouldn't recommend this place unless I really didn't like the person.< /text>< Resp>

< review>
I booked a reservation with these guys but didn’t notice my dates were wrong and they charged me already for it so the day of I called them to cancel it and if I can get my refund and a guy name AUSTIN that works front counter specifically told me as my mom && family as a witness cause he’s on speaker he said I would guarantee get my refund of $200 plus back. I mean come on now I booked it for the days I WAS STILL IN AK not CALI. A week or so later still NOTHING!!.. at this point I’m getting really irritated and wouldn’t mind flying back to CALI and raising hell in their office because the MANAGER is NEVER around and the front desk is NO HELP AT ALL smfh. All I want is my money back because I NEVER STAYED WITH YALL && I’m glad I didn’t because of all of the other reviews I’m seeing now on how WORTHLESS this Hotel or Motel is!!..<//review>

<date>1576615702103<//date><rate>1</rate><Text>We stayed at 5 hotels & motels in Texas, California & Nevada in last couple months, Rainbow Inn is the worst. Room is very stinky, dirty, damages every where, you can find much better places for the same price. The attitude of receptionist and manager are terrible, they did not return my ID after check-in & check-out. My dad was in hurry to airport, after we got back to home land, my dad called and talked to both receptionist and manager. The way they talked are very impolite, finally they agreed to mail it to us. 2 weeks later my dad called back & was told the ID is still there & and asked my dad to reapply for new ID. For the security of my family, my dad decided to report it to Police, FBI, CIA.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>The most horrific stay we have ever had. Very dirty and uncared for room, which could be expected for how cheap it was. We brought our own blankets and could handle that, we were not expecting a five star stay for that price. However on our 3rd night we had a man knocking on our door multiple times throughout the night not leaving us alone even after my husband explained he had the wrong place. He was definitely under the influence. By 1am we decided we did not feel safe enough to stay and called the police. We also called the front desk and when I explained what happened the man on the phone asked for my room number and then hung up. Once the police showed up, we got out of there immediately. The next morning (today) when I called the front desk to explain the situation and hopefully get some sort of a refund, she yelled at me for not coming to the front desk and refused to refund. Even though I told her we DID call The front desk she said she can’t refund because we booked through an outside source. She was extremely rude and condescending. Would recommend taking this off of your site for available booking, it was extremely awful. Please let us know what can be done about receiving any kind of refund for this stay.</text><rating>None<//rating>< user_name>

Room was horrible, I think there are better rooms in the hotel but I know the one I got was gross, holes in the walls, weird paint splatters that weren't suppose to be there, carpet that was permanently sticky and stains I can't even describe on the walls. And they wanted to charge $100 for that.  You couldn't pay me to stay here again.< /Review>

This hotel was disgusting! There was blood stains on the walls and the bathroom door. There was tagging on the furniture and walls.The bathroom door was broken it looked like it was kicked in. Then to top it off there was a bunch of crack heads running around outside all night. The list goes on but bottom line DO NOT STAY HERE</review>

TERRIBLE! We walked in with a prepaid room. She sent us to two rooms and when we opened the door people were already staying in them! Terrible service. We had to leave and purchase a different hotel. They refused to give us our money back but they didn’t have any rooms!! Never stay here!</Review>

<text>We stayed there for two nights while we visited Disneyland. Rooms were clean. Decent bedding and pillows. Pretty quiet; couldn't hear our neighbors at all. Even though all rooms were booked due to a convention going on at the same time. Service was friendly. The reason why I didn't give five stars is because of the parking. Parking lot is small and you can't park in front of your room which I would have preferred. Otherwise a good experience. We would stay again.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

The pictures are outdated. The place is sketchy. To many "gang related " posted outside the motel. It is cheap. It did smell bad in a room that it was none smoking. The car parking is small compare to the other hotel near by. The staff was friendly but other then that I was walking by my room and there was just a random guy posted by the stairs. For a sec I thought he was a security but he was just one of those guys being a loser on meth. I hope they remove the pictures and add the recent ones. I hope it gets better if not there is a motel 6 near it which looks promising.</Text>

<Text>Dirty floors, linen has cigarette burns, room had a lingering cigarettes. Nightly activity with crackhead like behavior. Everyone sits in front of their room door and watches each other. Front desk doesn't care, they were paid already.
I'll put it this way, they get two stars, 1 for having direct TV and 2nd for having working hot water.<//Text><response>None< /response><UserId.>112742025444727649795< /UserId.><user_name>Johnny Gonzalez<//user_name>< pictures>

<Review>Upon getting there, shady people hanging out outside the hotel rooms, watching your every move; scary situation being there by myself, didnt feel safe for myself or my car parked there. Non-smoking room smelled of cigarette and musk. Bathroom celling had obvious humidity damage. Bathtub was stained and peeling. Whole room seemed to have some humidity issue of water damage as most floor moldings and corners seemed corroded. Floor didnt seem at all clean. Unsanitary fridge. Loud noise from neighbors fraternizing and boisterous socializing was easily heard.Only upside was large mounted tv.< /Review><Name>Travelocity reviewer< /Name></record>

Really good price!! A little under dated,  but a good flat screen t.v. that isn't static is way better than nothing. The beds are comfy and clean, (comfy because I like firm beds) I prefer this place to the Howard Johnson conference center to be honest. It has no free breakfast, but a few good places to get food are really close. The staff is friendly. I would recommend this as a place for just a nights rest if your going to spend a whole day out at the theme parks!!< /text>

<Review>This place was great price wise and the customer service was good. They were polite and nice. I was not impressed with the room or the atmosphere. These departments need some drastic work done. I was hoping to rest but instead there was people up at all hours of  night and it was very uncomfortable.</Review>< rating>

<text>I honestly don't understand the negative comments and complaints. I've stayed here twice already and I absolutely love it! For a NON high class motel, it's great! When I walked in, it was a little stuffy but all I had to do was turn on the A/C. The beds are decent. Everything is decent! There should be no complaints about this motel especially for it being on beach blvd! If you're those people who have to complain about everything then spend $125 for a night. That's all I have to say! The rainbow inn is my favorite! And the guy at the front desk is awesome and helpful.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<text>This hotel was the worst. As soon as we got to our room, it smelled like cigarettes & the smell wouldn’t go away no matter how much febreeze we sprayed. The bathroom sink would drip it’s water, there was a huge hole on the wall, you could just see the room wasn’t well taken care of. The pictures they post is such a false advertisement. Too many like homeless people living there and would make too much noise at night. Don’t let them fool you for the “cheap” “good” price, it’s not worth it. I’ve stayed at much better hotels for around the same price. Just awful.<//text>< user_id>

It was filthy and terrifying. Everything surface in the room was grimy and covered in stains, the blankets had cigarette burns, I was tempted to sleep in my car but the general area wasnt very nice. Long term residents were milling around everywhere, smoking on the staircases and washing their cars in the parking lot. The water pressure, however, was excellent.<//text>

Worst motel I've ever stepped foot into. Doesn't even deserve 1 start, but I had to select one in order to submit this. We had just arrived after an 8 hour drive, so we checked in, threw our luggage in the room and left for dinner. When we came back and actually saw the conditions, we were disgusted! There is human fecies and urine on the bathroom walls and floor. Hair in the fridge, on the sink and all over the beds, as well as stains from God knows which bodily fluids all over the comforters. There are so many more things like the floor not swept and dead bugs everywhere and the jucuzzie is ice cold. We went to the office wanting to leave and they refused to refund our money to stay somewhere else and in fact wanted to charge us a cancelation fee to not be charges for future nights which came out to a little less than our full reservation of 3 nights anyways. Further more he stood there arguing with us, stating we are wrong the room was fully cleaned when we arrived and he even refused to come to the room and see the conditions for himself. Terrible business. Teerible customer service. And disgusting rooms. Do yourself a favor and stay anywhere but here!!<//text>

<review>I would give this hotel a zero and a big fat ZERO On that. This hotel is disgusting DO NOT FALL FOR THE PICTURES THIS IS NOT A FAMILY HOTEL. The managers or owners no clue who they are but they are the WORST!!!!!there's no point talking to them or trying to tell them there's an issue if you do they will try and call the police on you. I was staying at this inn for not even a night it was so disgusting my wife and I had to sleep in the car. When we entered our room there was left over food in the fridge and in the MICROWAVE!! like seriously its not hard to check that before a guest checks in. Now on top of that bed we filthy bathroom toilet was clogged on our arrival and the door to the bathroom was kicked open by someone or something because the lock and door were splintered out. I mean we took pictures of the hole in the wall too we have uploaded them to Expedia if anyone wants to see them!! My wife and I called Expedia to complain about this dump and while doing that we were simultaneously talking to the front desk and she said we were rude and loud and she's called the authorities. Because we complained on this oh before I forget also outside the room door everyone was either on drugs on on something it was horrible! Expedia called the hotel for me to complain about there service and they said my wife was naked and a prostitute!! I mean are you F****** kidding me how dare YOU and how would they see her, there's a tiny window in the corner of the room facing and empty street while we're on the second floor??!! She's a nurse and I'm in insurance I came on work!! EXPEDIA WAS HORRIFIED BY THERE RESPONSE AND ILL INTENT from the motel. I'm going to try to put the pictures here for everyone to see. DO NOT AND I MEAN DO NOT STAY HERE ITS A HEALTH RISK!!!! Honestly this place needs to be demonlished I think it's infested. Even though we paid the night we slept in the CAR!!! My wife didn't even want to use the shower or bathroom here.  Please for all that is a cheap price it's better to sleep in a rental car!</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPehWyQdSU2QDOxXwpSXoH_l6jOjYk5HaSwQYqH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< user_id>

<text>Was very dirty. Curtains,bedding, refrigerator, microwave, bathroom toilet were all DIRTY And even towels looked dirty. Wouldn't recommend coming here. We saw what a nightmare it was and wanted to book another hotel but they were all booked otherwise we would have left immediately. Locations is convenient close to bbn Disneyland but that's the ONLY good thing about this place!@</text>< pictures>

< Review>
Room number 220 on May 25th 2019 was pathetic, It was the worst hotel I've ever been in the room the blanket  hadthrow up on it no fitted sheet there was half a pill on the dresser, no towels,  burns
on the blanket as well didn't didn't bother sweeping the floor. Was discusting . Then went to office to refund my money and the owner had an attitude with me. REALLY THE WORST PLACE TO STAY AT NO MATTER  HOW CHEAP.......< /Review>

They treat you right n price is the lowest you can find anywhere. Rooms are larger than expected and spic n span clean. The guy at the front desk was not only friendly but he was very helpful as well as made me comfortable. You'd think that it would have cost much more. If this was a case of "you get what you pay for"  tben this one has the bonus feature<//Review>

The rooms are disgusting, the linens were riddled with cigarette burns (in a none smoking room) the walls were covered in bad drywall repair, our smoke detector was missing entirely (appeared to have burn marks around it😂) an entire plug socket was covered in scotch tape, and the room smelled like some class A mold. I would occasionally step outside for a smoke and for the 15 minutes I was out side endless cars would be coming and going (this hotel is small maybe 40 rooms). Insane amounts of shady dudes just sitting in the parking lot, homeless people just walk the parking lot aimlessly like an episode of the walking dead. At one point some guy with a respirator mask and gloves was walking in and out of a random room with a security door like an episode or breaking bad. Honestly if you need a room spend the extra $20 a night and stay some place else. It was honestly comical how horrifyingly bad this place was.

On top of that, we found a bed bug on one of the beds. I am pretty sure there are other places close by that are the same price but nicer. The one good thing was that staff was very friendly and accommodating.<//Review>< Pics>

You get what you pay for. Not a bad place, not nice either. Room wasn't ready and we arrived at 7pm? Kind of weird. A few sketchy guests asking for cigarettes at night, but a lot of Disney~excited guests with kids in the morning. 15 min drive to Disneyland with traffic and one wrong turn.<//Text>

Worst place ever. I wish i could give zero stars
Expensive. The service at the front desk sucks.
I just needed a room to stay in for a few hours just for the sun to rise this was at 3am or so. i was willing to pay the entire night but the lady at the from desk said she doesn't give rooms to my kind. When i asked what she ment she said people who have crazy hair colors because all we do is throw parties and trash places that don't belong to us. I gladly walked away from there and asked an IHOP parking security guard if i could sleep in my car for a few hours< /Text>

This place is awful. Drug dealing going on all the time, jacuzzi doesnt work it was freezing cold. they told us that the warm water doesnt come included. Cops there every night and people actually live there. Rooms are filthy they had roaches, blood stains, dirty walls. The linen they provided had also stains but they said they washed them. Pictures on here are completely different rooms do not look that nice.</Review>

<text>Worst motel I've ever stayed in. VERY VERY DIRTY AND UNSANITARY. For a motel that has 100's of different people in and out of the place on a constant basis the place should pay attention to making sure it's clean and sanitized as to not spread germs and diseases to
other people. The managers care nothing about the place or it's upkeep. The county should shut it down until it's cleaned up and then maybe it was be worth the $50 it's costs online.</text>< Pics>

The mattress is turning yellow, the towels have dust and stains. Please do your health a favor and DO NOT STAY HERE. This place should not be considered inhabitable, let alone a place for lodging while on vacation.

<Text>They need to wipe down the inside of the doors! I hand washed it when staying myself and it was filthy! So if they paying their maids the least they can accommodate is housekeeping actually sanitarily doing their job! If you see spots on the walls wash it down! it’s gross paying for a room and it’s not clean thouroughly for the new guest arriving! Disappointing! Hope they do so as they renovate the new rooms their remolding because you definitely see why the old rooms need remodelling they weren’t taken care of properly at all. Other than that Guest service was welcoming and friendly.</Text>< pictures>

Then the phone wasn't even connected to anything because when we tried to use it my son saw that the wires had been pulled out of the wall. We went on Wednesday and they had music blasting at 12:20am then I didn't want my kids outside at all because you could see people dealing drugs it was way to obvious.

The a/c was taking too long to cold up the whole room and the bathroom knob was broken. Very slow wifi almost can't even connect to everything at all. The front desk doesn't look like she wants her job and the bed was a little bit smells and itchy<//Review>

The room was damp, the toilet couldn't flush, and the bath tub looked like it had not been washed in years.  I called the front desk and they moved me to another room, (the front desk gentleman was wonderful).  The second smelt damp too, but at least it looked better.  I slept there for one night and checked out the following day, despite the fact that I had paid for three nights.  That was a nasty experience.  The only advantage was the proximity to Disneyland.<//review>< rate>

We booked 2 rooms from this motel, if I could give it a lower rate I would. It isn't the most affordable rate in the area. And the rooms need a total new remodeling. The carpets are so old that there is an odor as soon as you walk in the room. The furniture is falling apart drawers are broken. Just a very poor experience. I would not recommend it to no one</Text>

<Text>Amazing place! They really saved the day when were unfortunate enough to rent a room from a really disgusting motel across the street. It cost around $325 for a week, but we ended up leaving because of how horrible it was. Rainbow inn promised us a weekly rate of $365, but when we got there they only charged us $310. Amazing beds with down comforters and pillows, really clean, fast wifi, flat screen TV, big room, quiet, nice staff, just amazing! Would recommend it to anyone!</Text><time>1378705770671< /time>< user_name>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>My initial assumption of the Inn was that it was nice of course this assumption was based on pictures.  Once we arrived we were greeted by a wonderful young man, who was very kind and helpful.  At this point I was quite satisfied with the Rainbow Inn.  Until I place my card in the key slot and opened the door, at which I immediately wanted to run in the opposite direction. I figured I only had to make it through a few hours until I checked into the next hotel.  As I walk in to the room some kind of odor permeated my nostrils, scared I leaned down and smelled the bed.. UGH... after this I entered the bathroom which stunk of urine and did not seem to have been cleaned in a relatively long time.  As a whole package I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.</Review>< pics>

Close to Knott's berry farm Disneyland and Honda center or angels stadium if you're in town for sporting events like I was. Easy in and out no issues there and good value for a place to rest your head without breaking the bank</Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>We have stayed here before for Disneyland. It was ok then and did its job. Price was good and good customer service.There were drug deals going on in the parking lot then when we stayed and the police came. Now on to the not so good part of our current stay. This go around is not the any better; we arrived just in time to see another drug deal going down right in front of the office. There were less pillows than last time and they are so flat and uncomfortable.  There's only 2 towels that I'm not sure if they are clean or not. You can smell someone in the room next door is smoking cigarettes in their bathroom. You hear people all night long. My daughter asked me if someone died at our hotel it was that bad. Yes, they have a flat screen; woohoo big deal. The air conditioner doesn't work, it is only blowing air from outside. Our room is soooooooo hot. The place is filthy and badly needs to be updated. Don't stay here if you value the safety of your family.< /text>< Response>

The mattresses are like stone slabs. The wifi reception is terrible and spotty at best. It just looks terrible. Ceilings leaked At one point and they did a lousy job of repair. Of course my wife wouldn't read the reviews prior to booking. But you really do get what you pay for. Rainbow sucks</Text>

<review>This motel should not be listed on Travelocity! We came back to the motel after visiting Disneyland with family after midnight tired and wanted to rest. We discoveed the pillow covers and bedsheets werent  changed from previous guest, there were filthy hairs and stains on the bedsheets. So you can imagine what a night mare and disgusted. Called the front desk and request new bedsheets. We have to change the two beds by ourselves. By the rime we were done changing it was close to 3:00am! We were book to stay for two nights, we checked out next morning!<//review>< Pics>

Well it was the cheapest available and did not offer any smoking rooms. You can smoke outside, but then if you go outside to smoke make sure you have the right colors on or you might get shot. Its that kind of place< /Review>

<review>Fair
For a budged is ok, very cheap I would say, close to Disneyland, others theme parks, Huntington Beach and many stores and restaurants, but this place could be better, I stayed 3 night there, and my biggest complaint it's about the smell in the room very bad it smells moody, but since I was in a very limited budged, I just bought some febrezze, and it help it... the guy at the front desk was very nice and helpful... if you are looking for something cheap and close to Disneyland and the beach this is the place just get your febrezze ready..< /review><rating>3<//rating></record>

As a previous employee of this establisbment, I would say that the only thing that the owners care about is your dollar. When people check out early, they won't bother to change any of the sheets or covers. They will simply make the bed, change the wet towels, and rent you the room. If you have a problem and it results in them losing a penny, they will find any and every way to ensure that you don't get anything from them. I've seen rooms with bed bugs that they continue to rent out. I don't have any problem with the owners but I have a huge problem with them renting out rooms that are swarming with bed bugs to families just trying to save a dollar for Disneyland. I wouldn't reccomend this place to my worst enemy.</text>

This was a second place where I had to pick up a Passanger that was kicked out.  My passanger was told that the Motel was completely booked an that her room was already booked by someone else. When I showed hee online that booking showed rooms available she was upset. She asked the manager for an explanation. She responded for her to leave or the police would escort her out. Not the friendly customer service that people post.</review>

Dirty, old, moldy, dusty, dingy, stained ceilings, and dead bugs on the ground. Room was filthy. Beds were small. Parking was bad. Motel 6 is a luxury hotel compared to this place. Pay a few extra dollars to stay elsewhere.<//text>

This place is HORRIBLE! I wouldn't let any of my fur babies stay here! It stinks, it's nasty and not fit to even use the rest room! I took pictures, if I could post them I would!!!
By the way, it's a shame you have to rate 1 star to even post!</Review>

The room they put us in was beyond disgusting, the nasty stench was only the beginning... A/c continuously blew out a nasty gross smell, tv from the early 90's, ceiling looked as if someone had smeared "something above 1 of the beds, beds were NOT queen size like claimed but in fact FULL size, dust ruffles were... Ugh, let's just say that one of them looked like it had "spunk" drizzled down it & onto the floor, comforters were so dirty they looked like they'd never been washed & smelled even worse, the carpeting was gross & I wouldn't take a chance walking on it for fear I may get some kinda cooties, the bathroom was DISGUSTING... Layers upon layers of paint trying to cover up mold in every single corner AND on the ceiling, walls had someone else's hair randomly dangling all over, pubic hairs all over, rim of the toilet bowl was so caked in black mold that I'm really not sure how it actually was able to still let water into the bowl, the tiles were not only sticky but so dirty that it was impossible to tell what the true color once was. The bedding below the disgusting "comforters" naturally smelled gross as well, & the "down comforters" were dirty & terribly stained, sheets were tattered & had been bleached so much that there was tears & holes in them... Under the beds literally had NEVER been vacuumed & had random stuff under them like little pins, hair balls from lord only knows when, dirt etc., behind the night stand is never cleaned nor are the corners through out the entire room, corners & baseboards had so much "crap" caked up that it'd probably take a jackhammer to get through it all, the headboards on both of the beds looked about as "clean as the flooring, baseboards & under the beds" (note the sarcasm there) and last but DEFINITELY NOT LEAST.... The noise through out the entire one night stay was ridiculous!! People on the 2nd floor right above our room were in & out all night, every step they took was heard like I was actually up in their room with them rather than below them,  people on each side of us could hear us talking & we could hear them as well, even over the tv being on.... Might I add that there was noise like that all night long non stop.  Oh & the door to get in & out of the room had no other lock of any kind other than the standard "card/key" type... Meaning that it could have been opened at any time by anyone with a "master key" and/or opened a lot easier by any UNinvited / UNexpected "guest(s)"....
I've been to & stayed in 1 & 2 star rated motels before & this one more than "takes the cake".... Seriously pondering the thought of contacting the local health dept for that area, give them a little insight on that place of pure nasty gross disgusting against health code sh*thole "place of stay/"motel".... I highly recommend NOT NOT EVEN CONSIDERING THE THOUGHT OF STAYING AT THE RAINBOW INN!!!!!!!!
Should you go against my will d here & try your luck there anyway, make POSITIVELY SURE that you DO NOT take any little brownish colored bugs with you when you check out to leave... BEDBUGS ARE A HORRIBLE THING to get rid of, & it only takes ONE SINGLE bedbug to create a disaster for any & all things you come in contact with, including people!!!!!!!! DO NOT STAY AT THE RAINBOW INN!!!!!!!!! Seriously just needs to be condemned... Ridiculous & overly disgusting 1,000,000,000,000,000 over!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Review>< pics>

<Text>First let me say this place is disgusting.  Walked in to our room and found the curtains were tied by a plastic garbage bag, then found rat poop on the floor. The heater/AC unit blows out this nasty smell and doesn't even heat the room, only one towel on the rack in bathroom, bathtub floor looks gross and the floors are all stained. Think twice or three or four times before booking here.</Text>< pictures>

Complete lie about breakfast.
The breakfast consisted of the cheapest dollar store muffins and elematary or daycare boxes of Apple or orange juice. Every guest within earshot was outwardly disappointed and verbally complaining.  The definition of false advertisement.<//Text>

The rooms are very nicely done clean and well kept up, but the management are rude and lie trying to make you pay more for the room than your supposed to have to pay and they say they have no vacancies when half the Motel has no guests in it</text>

If you need a place just to sleep and aren't trying to spend much this is the place... the rooms could use some remodeling or touching up but then again for what I paid I can't complain... parking is a mess tho.. seems half the cars there don't know how to park...</review>

Nice location, it's right next to the stores and some fast food restaurants. I only went to check if they had any rooms and they were expensive, but the lady was very nice. I would have stayed there if there wasn't 5 cheaper hotels right next to it<//text>

Me gusto la habitación muy amplia e instalaciones muy limpias.Lo que no me gusto fue que yo reserve hace mas de 3 semanas y pedí que mi pago fuera al llegar al hotel. Leí los terminos y condiciones y decía que tenia que llegar a hacer Check in antes de las 3. Puse una tarjeta de débito y en ese momento marqué a las instalaciones para avisar que mis amigos y yo llegaríamos a las 11 u 11:30 pm. Al momento de llegar nos mencionó una señorita y nos dijo que no se había reservado por que mi tarjeta no se había aceptado. Yo llevaba mi hoja de reservación y confirmación con el numero y todo, pero nos contestó que no se pudo hacer nada. Afortunadamente había una habitación disponible pero tuvimos que pagar más de lo acordado.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Not recommendable place. Completely failed experience. The rooms are terrible. Tags, soiled bed, greasy floor, broken furniture. After reporting to the reception, we were kindly invited to keep our room ..... after 1 hour waiting for our room to be cleaned, 1 family decided to leave the hotel and look for a new room in a other hotel. Really disappointing this type of standing! We can't put negative stars, too bad

(Original)
Endroit non recommandable. Experience complètement ratée. Les chambres sont exécrables. Des tags, lit souillés, sol gras, meubles cassés. Après signalement auprès de l'accueil, nous avons été gentiment invités a garder notre chambre..... en 1h00 d'attente du renettoyage de notre chambre, 1 familles ont décidé de quitter l'hôtel et de chercher une nouvelle chambre dans un autre hôtel. Vraiment décevant ce type de standing! On ne peut pas mettre des étoiles négatives, dommage< /Text>

<Review>The hotel was awful, the walls and furniture was marked with marker, dirty bath curtains, smelled like cigarette smoke, and the carped was tremendously filthy (food and other unrecognizable stuff piled up below the beds).I would never come back even for free.< /Review>< date>

Le personnel ont été serviables et courtois.Ils ont été chaleureux et mont été dune grande aide pour maider à me diriger dans la ville .  Lhôtel est situé à quelques pas des grandes attractions. Idéale pour les petits budgets et pour ceux qui ne recherche pas le gros luxe.  Je vais retourner dans cet hôtel lors de mon prochain voyage en Californie.< /review>< pics>

Unsere Zimmer waren schlecht isoliert, die Bettdecken, Wände, Teppiche, Möbel waren voller Flecken, es roch muffig (Fenster öffnen war allerdings aufgrund der Hauptstraße keine Option) und es war laut.
