<review>Moto Joes is awesome! It was time for my 4,000 mile service and I gave them a call and set up a day to bring my bike in. They were super nice and knowledgeable, let me know what they were going to check and do on my bike, and ended up doing the service faster and cheaper than the shop I went to for my 600 mile service. With a different shop I wasn’t super sure about what they actually did as far as the service goes, but I know for a fact my bike feels better after I got it serviced here!

Not certain if it’s a coincidence on timing or if it’s just that Moto Joe’s pays attention to everything on the bike, but before the service my kickstand was feeling a little stiff going down and now it feels as smooth as the day I bought the bike! If they have the attention to detail to catch that I have no doubt in my mind that the service done to the rest of the bike is just as awesome!

I’ll absolutely be back for any other work I end up needing on my bike!< /review><user_id>100599991050014350023<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80dafe87f40dd23b:0x16ca49692be95f1c< /Gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures><time>1611359736638<//time><Name>Cody Wagaman<//Name>< rate>

<Review>I contacted Moto Joe's while still in Mexico to see if the could service and install new tires on my KTM 950. While initially I thought there were concerns it turned out that more clarity was needed. After meeting Joe and arranging for what was required all went without a hitch. I was truly impressed with (Moto)Joe's knowledge and experience of not only my KTM but of my other motorcycles. As we were of the same (+/-) vintage we talked about our  Honda's, Kawasaki's, Suzuki's and even my Harley! I truly enjoy 'old time' shops that a competent and welcoming such as Moto Joe's. I give them my Pierre 5 stars and you can bet that if and when I'm back in the Coachella Valley I'll be back at Joe's.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWEbXRjzg2Ln2-3nQYKruBrAKzIDesD2uK4VYG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOb3KUvJ2uTMy4OnlHM3jcpELMYUOzVs3F1ca7F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_aPDinRQ90bOyZN3kGnx4U3krzsevkLJa0Wh3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

My kind of shop n show room.
Garage style all about bikes and knowledge with out all the extra bling.Called for a GSXR rear tire replacement had it swapped mounted balanced chain lube n clean and personal safe ride by the mechanic in about an hour.
Professional friendly down to earth with all the knowledge you could ask for.
Thanks Jose Moto!< /Review>

<review>Called to have my tire changed and they told me the tire for my bike was not currently in stock. I told them that it was fine and I would order my own that would arrive by the next day. They insisted I don’t do that but instead let them get the tire that would arrive in 1 day. Two days go by and I take my bike in for the tire change. Tire is no where to be found by the staff. Called the next day and was told the tire would not be here for another 3 days and I would be contacted to set up my tire change appointment. 3 days goes by and I receive no phone call from them. Went through all this pointless waiting when I could of already had the tire if I ordered it myself.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Joe was the second shop i called in search of a new front tire. The quote was 80 dollars less than the first place i called, also said next day service was available. I came in first thing the next day and was serviced immediately, first class treatment. I barely made it walking to the gas station and back before they were done, they found a loose bolt on the rear brake, showed me and fixed it free! The mechanic also showed me how to change brake pads on my bike too. I WILL come back another time. Thanks for the great service guys!<//Text>< user_id>

Joe is a great resource for me. His pricing is very competitive and he has been able to get pretty much any Motorsports part/accessory you could ask for. Although his store is small, he provides full service quickly and professionally.<//review>

When you need work on your motorcycle, Joe is the guy to see. He is honest about what he does and that can be a big relief when you are not familiar with fixing your own motorcycle.</review>

< Review>
Took me in with out an appointment that was the good part but the price for a full set was in believable 80 dollars.  Wow never in my life paid that much I did have anything special done. Way to pricey.  But they also switch you off to another person to finish off I don't like that either. I like one person to do the whole job. Anyway learnt lesson here. They were a nice couple.  And friendly. And that's what the stars are for.<//Review>

Anne did such a good job on my friend and I’s nails! She can recreate any design perfectly. That’s what she did with us. Our nails came out so good! Exactly like the picture I showed her. This is my go to salon now. I will definitely be coming back and asking for her!< /Text>

<review>The main lady that does the acrylic nails always looks upset. Like she hates her job., at first I thought she was having a bad day. I went back twice and the same thing. Never again. she is not professional makes you feel uncomfortable. My nails had bumps  and started lifting within a week.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

She was too busy in the phone to even ask me what I wanted aside form color. I asked for manicure with the sip powder but no manicure so my cuticles still look like garbage.  she filed down my nails even though I didn't want them filed down. like I said she was in her phone talking to some guy so It was difficult to even tell her what design I wanted or if they had specific colors. will not return</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtX1q61HPVbunhCQwbkg2ENibqQhJfvklLsl77=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><rate>1</rate></record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Honestly, I don't think I'm ever going to go to another salon. I was so blown away at the beautiful work Ann did. The nails are a little fatter, and not so thin. She soaked my older nails off instead of pulling them off (which I hate). She listened to everything I wanted, and was just a wonderfully pleasant woman.

If you need a new nail salon, come here. I cannot say enough good things about them.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1PBB1LRSTFYyPtws-7cCkVG_vsjXZ7S3XPbuT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKjYEC3GrVDSxe3Hd_GEHls5oFK056a9AX2MQe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

The place is clean the staff is beyond nice. I did not feel rush at all. They get busy so it’s best to make an appointment, they also do walk in but I am sure it will be a bit of a wait . Which I ya e no problem waiting for Anne. Finally found a salon I will be using in the regular .<//review>< username>

Definitely LOVED their work, Benjamin was such a SWEETHEART! He told me to sing to him while he did my nails and said i was really good! He’s so gentle as well. I STRONGLY suggest having Ben do your nails, and also strongly suggest you go here. Their services are awesome and all the workers are very polite. They always look like they need a laugh so don’t be afraid to talk to with them! ❤️<//text>

The lady that did my nails started with an A. First off I asked for the old set to be removed.. They ripped them off taking my real nail with it.  I asked if they can be soaked instead which she did but only grinded the fake nail down and did not removed them. They are lumpy and each nail has a different size.  I paid $45 for crap and my nails hurt way to much to go back to get them fixed.  My advise  is to slow down! I've attached pictures which don't do the justice of how bad they look.</Text>

<Text>I had been seeing Peter for a very long time when out of the blue when attempting to make an appointment I was told Peter was on vacation.  Ann assured me Peter would return in two weeks and told me she would be so happy to fill my nails in Peter's absence.  Ann was LYING, and I should tell you that she is the only woman filling nails in the salon in case you're wondering who the last reviewer saw.  Peter is never returning to this establishment however, I am delighted to report that I have found him.  He is on the south/west corner of Soledad & Sierra next to the Pizza Hut.  I received a magnificent spa pedicure at an unbelievable price as well as a much needed fill to perfection!! If you're looking for Peter you too may find him at 251-3186.<//Text>< resp>

They may be cheap, but you get what you pay for  is an old saying that's 100% true in their case! Had her wax my eye brows waxed here and I live local so it was convenient to go there and get it done. But a huge mistake! 😠 Because now I'm going to have to wait for three to four weeks or more to grow out me eye brows? Both are now completely uneven and look like two different eyebrows now. If I could seriously give zero stars for a rating, I would! But it requires at least one star. Avoid them at all cost! They're too stupid and careless to be in business. They're absolutely the worst and need their license pulled! I would always have to tell her how to do it and she would get offended???
She shouldn't be offended says I'm a customer. Her and her boyish girlfriend are not even legal here...
I'm calling the Better Business Bureau. Anybody else who has a problem should also. We can get them shut down if we all call. I had her offer discounts to give her a 5 star rating and begged me not to say anything bad about her poor work. I have also heard her say this to other people. In one case I know she did a girl's nails free and her sisters nails for free.
Most of their ratings are by their friends anytime they get five star. If you look at the scale they never get 2,3, or 4 Stars, it's either 1 Star mostly... the few 5 star ratings she gets her boyfriends of hers that she gives big discounts or does free work for.
If this is all she does by trade, then she has absolutely no Talent at all! I'll say it again, avoid her at all costs! Better to pay more and get it done right then to Pay less and be unhappy.< /Review>

<text>The service was horrible. They screwed up my cousins nails and made her cry when it was their fault. And in seeing that my cousin was crying, they didn't even try to make her feel better. Instead, they proceeded to tell her that it was her fault for not telling them how she wanted her nails when we had specifically told the lady to do her nails a certain way when we first got there and reminded the lady again before my cousin got her nails done. They don't do it the way you want it done. Instead, they tell you how you should get them done. Which is fine whatever recommend all you want but telling someone exactly how to get their nails done is a huge no.</text><Rate>1< /Rate><response>None<//response><user_id>103563322710107983355< /user_id>< gmapID>

Great service, good coffee. There was one male employee (didn't get his name) who was very personable and fun and gave a great drink suggestion that we really liked. It's good to see happy, enthusiastic employees who make you feel special and valued.< /Review>

I ordered a strawberry frappuccino with whipped cream. It was perfectly made and they were very quick about it. I would go to this location again. What's nice is that u can get your target shopping done and get your Starbucks right away.< /review>

The past three times I've come for something, they didn't have it. It's ridiculous and there's always an excuse. If you're looking for something specific, I highly suggest you go elsewhere to ensure they have it. Also, you can't pre-order on the app, so there's no knowing unless you're there in line.

The staff are always nice.<//Text>

<text>There was only 1 person working, and she was very slow. Took about 10 minutes to place my order because she was chatting with the person in front of me. There were also many people in line behind me. Then, she didn't shake my iced tea but poured it in the cup and added ice. They also were out of sandwiches.</text>< user_name>

Quality low.  Went today and got an ice tea and a tomato mozzarella panini ~ tea is fine but the panini had no tomatoes or spinach.  So I spent $5.55 on melted cheese, bread and pesto.  Sandwich was heated and then put into a pastry bag so it is not possible to check ~ but why should you have to when these are premade and packaged?  Just disappointed.< /Review>

No outlets at this location as it's in a Target store. It's a good place to chill out though and get out of the heat.< /Review>

<text>It's a shame this place isn't better because it has an excellent outdoor seating area and it's located in a relaxing area. The pizza was New York style in slice size and thickness, but was so dry that I didn't even need a napkin when I was done. They have no hot sauce. The restroom was grimy, poorly lit, covered in graffiti, and seems like it's barely washed.

I felt bad for them because right when I arrived the health department was posting a B, but the owner left immediately after the health department guy, so I get the impression that this business is not his primary concern. If a little more attention was put into this place it could be a lot better.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>I'm shocked this place is not more popular.  I have been coming here for years.  It is the closest pizza to real New York you will find in Los Angeles.  I now live all the way in Glendale and I make the drive almost every week.  The pizza is that good!  Yes it is a little pricey but that because they use the best ingredients.<//review>< pictures>

5 years ago when I moved into the area the food was good. Today will be my last order. The toppings were sparse. A pizza with spinach had 2 pieces of spinach per slice. The chicken I paid extra for added up to a small handful of little pieces. I ordered food asking it to be well done (chicken) it was not.
And the girl who answers the phone is so rude!-She could use some lessons in communication.
I  would suggest looking elsewhere for something to eat.< /text>

<Review>Worst customer service. I ordered two salad's online and asked to get the salad without croutons. I also wrote a detailed delivery description. As my order never arrived, I called the restaurant. The person who picked up the phone was very unfriendly and almost yelling at me that it wasn't his fault and what I want. I told him that I'm wondering where my delivery is and that he should know. He yelled something and the driver came on the phone. The driver said that he delivered the order and that's it. Nobody apologized.
In the end I found out that the order was delivered to a different house, so I had to drive around to find it eventually.
On top of that, the salad I ordered without croutons came with them. Quality was poor for what you are paying.

Mistakes can happen - even though it is annoying that the order was delivered to the wrong address -I understand. BUT yelling at me on the phone and being super unfriendly without even apologizing is a NO GO.

Will never order there again!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Very poor.

Charged tobdollars for coke.  Handed a can of coke.

Chicken wings not marinated just had sauce poor over them.

Pizza was ok but base was soft.  Otherwise would have been zero for this visit.

We ordered a medium mushroom and chicken pizza. What we found when we got back to our boat was basically red colored with some flecks of what we assumed was cheese. There were no mushrooms or chicken! The person who served us opened the box and checked the pizza before giving it to us. We didn't feel like driving back to ask for a refund and by then we were so hungry that we decided to just choke it down. It was easily the worst "pizza" that either one of us has ever eaten.< /text>

My wife and I are from out of town and were at the Marriott for the nite with our daughter. So we decided to order a pizza from this place because it looked good. Couldn't even get that far, due to the customer service. Whoever answered the phone, was some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. He was very disrespectful and could not answer 1 question about the food. Owner should look in to this guy making the businesses look really bad, because you don't treat paying customer's wit such utterly disrespect.< /Review>

<Text>We ordered 4 pizzas and the wrong order was delivered. When we called to ask for a redelivery of the incorrect pizza we were told we could reorder and pay for the pizza or we could have a $5 coupon for a future order. We asked for a manager and we're told they would call back. After 30 minutes and no call, we called back and we're hung up on when we asked for a redelivery. Stay far away from this place.<//Text>< pictures>

I'll gladly give more stars when my food arrives. It's over an hour late (approaching 2 hours since ordering), the restaurant is closed, and I'm beginning to think it's not coming. :-(

Otherwise 1 star will have to stand.<//Review>

Worst experience ordering pizza in my life. I paid for the pizza online and showed up and the person behind the counter wanted 3 more dollars on top of the $26 I paid for 1 pizza, I waited for my order and walked back to my room and found they put jalepenos on my pizza. I called and they offered to deliver a new pizza and when they showed up they asked for the old pizza back and caused a big scene in the hotel complaining about how we attempted to try to eat a piece. He eventually gave me the pizza and left mumbling things under his breath after asking for $10 more dollars for a runny pizza.< /review>

I'm fearful they might be open to long. I wouldn't even give them one star. But this owner, not sure what one. told me the restroom was for adults only. I just needed to change the boys diaper. Next he acted real peculiar when I asked about my pizza, after 30mins I went back inside requested my money back. And he said it's been ready...and handed me a Luke warm pizza. I was furious. Stated he was a dushebag and left.. what a tool! Oh, and btw the pizza was like 36$ SMH</text>

The food was decent but the service was not good. Owner /manager /whoever was serving needs a an attitude adjustment. He turned away a couple of customers in a short time I was there.< /Review>

I love the pizza. It's a great local pizza place. Salad is always fresh. They also have different kinds of pasta that I like.</review>

<review>The only decent reviews made about this place have to be people who are paid because I will never be returning and have already told several people near me not to as well. We ordered a pizza online after their website said we’d save $3 that way. Since the pizza was already a bizarre $27 we have it a go. My husband walked to their restaurant and when he arrived the man demanded the extra $3. I guess their business is doing so bad they are really riding on the extra cash. So he gave him the extra money and took the pizza and left. Once he got back to the hotel we found out there were japenpenos on it. Which wasn’t apart of our original order since I am allergic to them. So my husband called them and asked for a new pizza or a refund of some type. A lady answered the phone and said that it would be no problem to have someone deliver it for us. A man delivered the pizza to the hotel and asked for the old one back. Not sure why... a little gross if you ask me but who knows maybe since their company is doing so bad they needed it for dinner tonight. However my husband walked back to the room and grabbed the old one after the man followed him up the elevator to our room. He asked the man to keep his distance because he wasn’t sure what the mans intentions were. My husband gave the man the old pizza and the man boarder line assaulted him causing a scene at the hotel because a piece was missing. Which was thrown away once we discovered the jalepenos. Anyways he demanded $10 more dollars for a horribly made pizza I’m assuming was made with no effort due to us not being satisified with the first. They really know how keep business right? Anyways I’ve already told other guest in the hotel to stay away and I will continue to spread this review on other sites. If you are visiting the area there are MANY other GREAT places to eat.<//review><GmapID>0x80c2ba977fbc315d:0x3d0c22b7c1cd2b4a< /GmapID><response>None</response><Name>Megan Terry<//Name>< Date>

4 dollars for a slice of pizza is expensive. 4 dollars for a bland slice of pizza is inexcusable. This place is very hit or miss I've gotten decent pies here before hence the 3 stars. Maybe it was an off day.< /text>

Food was not good: gristly sausage and what tasted like canned sauce. Would not recommend it. I have no idea about the decor because I had the food delivered. Assuming it must be excellent, or the place would be out of business by now.</review>

<review>I ordered a large sausage..lets say most slices of the pizza didnt have any sausage. I swear I didnt say half cheese and half sausage or a dash of it . I asked for a L Sausage and was very disappointed. Not only that the blonde girl who was at the counter was not nice at all. She talked to me like I didnt belong in that part of town,like totally uninterested in servicing the customer..What the hell?? There was a gentleman who walked in and stood behind me when he got up to her and said he only wanted a slice,she says so rudely "go over there then" indicating him to the other side where the pizza is behind the glass..Overall Pizza was a fail but the girl and her service was worse..<//review>< pics>

Frankie and Johnnie's New York Pizza is a popular hot spot for surfers and Venice Beachians alike.  I am pretty sure my boyfriends' roomates alone could keep the place afloat, however there is always someone chowing on a pizza or sipping a beer at all hours of the day.

Frankie and Johnnie's extensive menu, quality food, and convenience keep us coming back for more.  Everyone is sure to find exactly what they want and prepared just the way mom made it. We take advantage of their to-go service, dialing their number from speed dial and picking it up percisely 10 mintues later without any wait or line.  Our house favorites are the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Grilled Vegetable Sandwhich, and pastrami reuben.  The Grilled Vegetable Sandwhich combines a variety of cooked vegetables providing a beautiful pallete of colors and tastes, to create a sandwhich of perfection.<//text>

(Translated by Google) The pizzas were tasty and although the place is not very big, the waitress gathered some tables and we ate nine that afternoon. Attentive treatment.

(Original)
Las pizzas estaban sabrosas y aunque el local no es muy grande, la camarera juntó unas mesas y comimos nueve esa tarde. Trato atento.<//review>

<Text>The gas station is fine, but if you go to Baskin-Robbins watch out, I got overcharged nearly two dollars.  However, after contacting the corporate office, I got some money back on the next order which happened after a week.  Unfortunately, they still charged me food tax, and I don't get why!<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Too cramped hard to maneuver to a spot. Entry way and exit can be a pain. Car wash line has taken  over 50 minutes and counting. I’m tempted to leave, unfortunately I paid at the pump with gas.  No prices on beverages it’s an overpriced surprise at the counter. Gas price clarification  the $3.09 per gallon is only if you purchase a car wash.< /Text>< pics>

< Review>
The old Mexican worker is a big racist. I gave him $100 and Advil to purchase along with a couple other items and he said I have no change. The customer after me came in and gave him a $100 and wanted $10 in gas and this guy went to another register to make change to give to him. RaCist RaCist RaCist RaCist<//Review>

< review>
UPDATE! ROBBING! BREAK-IN AT MY FRIEND’S HOUSE! WE ALSO HAVE BEEN RECEIVING REPORTS OF SOMEONE’S HAVING UNKNOWN TRIANGLE MARK AT THE APT DOOR! DANGEROUS! DO THINGS YOU COULD TO PROTECT YOUR LIFE! It’s dying inside. Oh, and outside as well. That’s why they are struggling to retrofit the walls, while that’s a torture to residents since we gotta be waken up by sounds of punching and scratching and have no where to get in/out of our apt. It’s full of defects, and danger too. I would have given a negative 5 stars if there’s a way.< /review>

I have lived here for two years now. The good side of living here is they keep the outside clean, except the pool. But they wake you up at 8 am with a lot of noise. When it comes to your own claims the office does nothing to help you and/or will blame you for your concern. I have been trying to move out but they do not let me due to their own unreasonable excuses. Expensive to live here. Maintenance takes forever. They tried to kick me out at one point and forced me to agree to a renovation I kept saying I did not want. They then proceeded to still charge me for rent after trying to kick me out.<//Text>

I personally love living here. I have a lot of sq footage. The pool and spa are pretty nice, especially to have people over during spring quarter and the summer. The ladies at the office are always sweet and help me out all the time. They're incredibly pet friendly. Give out a lot of free stuff. Also my apartment was spotless when I moved in, and I know that a lot of other apartments don't do as good of a job cleaning.</text>

{'time': 1548975173435, 'text': 'Hello Michelle,\nThank you for your feedback. We appreciate hearing from our residents. I sincerely apologize for your dissatisfaction. I know the construction can be inconvenient at times, but it will be over very soon. Tanglewood has made many updates throughout the years to have our residents live in the best community in Davis. Tanglewood strives to be transparent with all residents. I know the lease agreement can be very long and tedious to read entirely, so I understand how it could have been an oversight to the "Construction" notification. Tanglewood does our very best to get notices out to residents far before the legal 24 hour notice. Currently all notices are sent out the Friday before the week of work being performed. If you have additional suggestions on how we can improve our practices, I would love to sit down with you to discuss further. Again, we value your feedback and we thank you for your residency.\nSincerely,\nLayce - Community Director'}< /Resp>
<Review>I wish I can give them a negative star. The apt didn’t tell their tenant before contract signed that they r going to renovate during the leasing year. If u think this is acceptable cool. When they try to replace the door and windows, they break into ur apt and even the room without asking ur permission even thoug they’ did send a email. All ur stuffs r mess during the renovating and they even moved my bed and broke my stuff. Super suck and feel terrible to live here. The supervisor is mean too.< /Review><Time>1548972785678< /Time><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMwDjVny3-ypeAviOwS7_XRTOTzi8PkIbxqaZxK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< GmapID>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>First of all, let me say that the one star is for the fact that the apartment is near the grocery store and the concierge is really responsive and fast. And here we go: 1- my bike tire got stolen from the bike rack and also the bike rack itself it's so thin that the robber can easily cut the bike rack. 2- My car got hit by eggs in my parking space and other houses I heard they got hit by eggs too, also cars windshield got broken in the parking space. 3- the pool isn’t safe, strange people come to the pool with dogs. ( two bulldogs without leash and swimming in the pool and poop in the pool). 4- I saw leftover urine in the Pepsi bottle near the pool and in the parking lot. 5- a big construction without further notice before signing the lease, however, they are saying that it was mentioned in the lease agreement but for this massive construction they should notify the leaser about it. It's impossible to be in the house with this loud noise and dust coming to our apartment. 6- no gardening happening however you can see toxic mushrooms outside 7-rude management you can’t really talk to them especially the one lady sitting in the back room. I just shared my experience for Tanglewood apartment. oops i forgot to say that there is no tennis court or basketball court.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1552061067636, 'text': "Hello Andrew,\n\nThank you for taking the time to bring these concerns to my attention.

They had made no change even a lot of people complained about it over a whole year. It’s not everyone should get up before 8 AM just to cooperate with their work right? This one star review is for the noise and the workers. I like the office staff though, they are friendly and helpful.< /Text></record>

<text>Hello whoever is reading this,
I am a second year at UC Davis. My roommates and I chose Tanglewood as our first official home away from home. Since no one counts the dorms as a home. We chose their 2 bed 2 bath renovated apartment. It is me and 3 others so rent is only $580 a month. Counting utilities it gets up to around $650 a month per person. All the amenities like their: 24 hour gym, 24 hour study room, AND a pool and hot tub with surrounding BBQS and fire pits. All this and they also have great employees!

Their office staff... WOW they are all so nice. Whenever I walk in to the office they are like "Hey Preston!" And they check in to see how they can improve my living here at Tanglewood.  Kyra, the "Assistant Community Director", somehow remembers my name... mind blowing for me. I am absolute poop at remembering names. Layce, the person in charge// the "Community Director" is also really nice. You just have to get past the fact that she has to do her job and tell you not to stick an amazing painting on your balcony wall, 'cause it might damage their newly stuccoed walls. It totally makes sense! I am just one of those bone headed people that want to do the opposite of what people tell me. But I'm glad that has been the only not so great thing about living here. Anyway... the Bosses are great people. Then there's Brandon. I don't know his official Title, but he is great! Sometimes during the day, when we are in the Tanglewood 24 hour study lounge... yes they have one of those... he will stop by and we will chat about something, or anything.  He is officially "office staff" but feels more like your friend when you get to talk to him. I am happy to live here and have them as the office staff, especially when I talk to quite a few of my friends from the dorms last year, who NEVER see their apartments' office staff OR maintenance.

Speaking of maintenance, I'm going to brag about them now. I have filed at least 5 maintenance requests, for a bunch of different things: light in the fridge went out, smoke detector needed to be changed out, shower knob became lose, and even one because our dryer wasn't drying on the first run. They all the week of submitting the request. Except the light in the fridge which was within two weeks. It's great. I am not going to lie, the washer/drier, dishwasher, stove, oven, and microwave are not top of the line appliances, BUT they work well and Tanglewood is great about fixing things when something comes up.

This morning, Tanglewood had free drinks and doughnuts in their study lounge for a little thanksgiving treat. They say it is nothing in comparison to what they will be doing EVERY DAY during finals week. This is what finally pushed me to leave them a nice review.

I am very happy here. And believe whole heartedly that we made the right decision by choosing to live in Tanglewood.</text><response>{'time': 1574782951022, 'text': 'Hello Preston,\n\nWOW!

<text>I really enjoyed my time at Tanglewood. Large apartment, with plenty of closet space were two things I was looking for when I moved to Davis and Tanglewood was the perfect match. The leasing office staff comprised of Denise and Becca were always friendly and quick to help me with whatever I needed. I can't say enough about how nice  I was treated. Maintenance staff is top notch as well. Quick and efficient.If for some reason I find myself back in Davis, Tanglewood is where I would want to live.< /text></record>

If I could leave 0 star, I will definitively do that. Layce Baker which is the Community Director at Tanglewood Office is not offering any solution for people who want to rent the apartment and also with BAD attitudes. Giving people some ridiculous  requirement. If you want to rent the apartment, you need to have 5X on your gross income, if you do not have it, then you need to have one year rent in your saving account which is more than $20,000. Seriously? People who make under $5000 DO NOT think about rent here because this is impossible. I-20 international students are does not have those income requirement, and the requirement is different to international students and California residents. No students are going to qualify for these ridiculous requirement. If you sign it up, it is actually hard to let other people take over your lease. There are many choices in Davis, DO NOT CHOOSE Tanglewood!!!  1. Apartment construction is never end. It actually started in September, 2017 until now 2019 2. The rent is going up every year without any reasons. 3. Office Workers are  Sucks.< /Text>

The qualifying process can be stressful, and at times seem unnecessary. Rest assured, all applicants are screened equally and fairly to meet the same criteria and given all the same options. Luckily, Tanglewood is able to take several different forms of income, can combine those forms of income to meet the income criteria, and also offer additional options for guarantors/cosigners to help cater to all applicants.

I went into the office and asked to speak to management and she would not come out because she was “too busy.” While the lady at the front explained to her what was going on the manager spoke very loudly so I could hear and said, “crime has no zip code” which is true in a sense, but if you acknowledge it and my surrounding neighbors had their cars broken into as well in recent months. Why wouldn’t you be proactive and assist your residence in feeling safe?  I asked management about moving car ports or hiring security or placing cameras in the parking lot. She stated I could not move car ports because it would be a “domino effect.” My issue is not every apartment has a vehicle and if they were to get one, I’d of course move my car. There is a lot of theft in this complex with bicycles and people stealing packages that were delivered to your door. People from the trailer park come over at late hours of the night to smoke marijuana, also there is many transients that come and scavenge through the garbage at different times of the day.  You are paying a pretty penny to live here and quite frankly it’s not worth it. Find another place to live; that is my honest and best advice.<//Text>< Pics>

Horrible & arbitrary management of the lease, not letting the residents know that there gonna be the massive construction throught almost the whole year.

1) They did not give a single hint that there will be a massive contruction on the building we live in. I am pretty sure there is no legal problem about this, but as one of people who don’t read every single lines of the contract, I felt greatly deceived. The noise was so loud that it ruined my days multiple times,and we got kicked out from our house on a very arbitrary date they decide.

2) There was a change in our lease. They emailed us a deadline for making a change on the lease. However, 2 days before the deadline, they suddenly emailed that we have to reply by 4pm, again, without any previous notice or clue while we all planned out so that the things work out right before the deadline.

I got so much unnecessary troubles added in my life THANKS to Tanglewood.</review>

**update, Tanglewood noteded no damage when we moved out but still decucted $400+ from our deposit, to me this seems to be unreasonable.

Tanglewood has nice facilities and decent staff, at least in my interactions but also misses a number of the fine details. EX. The gym is out of cleaning supplies, the communal grill doesn't work and my hallway light​ was out for months despite requests for a fix.

Hey all, an update- our washer has been broken for 3+ weeks now despite several requests for a fix, only Jerry rigged fixes have been applied, we were promised a new part was coming weeks ago however have not received an update.

Nearly every appliance in the apartment has broken at some point. Fixes are slow to come.< /text>

< Review>
While living at Tanglewood, I didn't have any major issues.  My bad experience began when I moved out.  Although I had rented the apartment 'as is,' I still left it in a much cleaner condition than when I moved in.  Upon moving out, they charged me several hundred dollars in cleaning.  They have not responded to my calls, requests or complaints.  I have hired an attorney to deal with the matter and they have failed to respond to any of these requests.  The drama begins after one moves out.</Review>

{'time': 1552405136559, 'text': 'Hello Yolanda,\n\nThank you for your feedback. I do apologize the construction is going on, but your building is almost done if you are getting your front door painted or just had it painted. We did have to reschedule some painting days due to weather, but all front doors are painted in 1 day. All instructions were on your Notice of Entry form, but I understand how that could have been an oversight. The weather has been so wet lately that it has really slowed some things down, so we sincerely appreciate your patience.\n\nYou are more than happy to reach out to the leasing office during normal business hours to report any suspicious activity, but outside business hours we do ask you to contact the Davis Police Department. Should you need further assistance please let me know. Crime has no zip code, but we can try to help where we can. I would like to speak with you directly. I am available Monday to Friday from 9am to 4:30pm. You can contact the leasing office at 530.757.6130. Thank you, again, for your feedback.\n\nSincerely,\nLayce - Community Director'}< /Response>

The staff here are awful and they can't stand for you to request a work order when something is wrong.  They get a 0 for customer service.  I would give them 0 stars if I could.< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) **Roommate changes/takeovers will not occur until a lease renewal for 2019-2020 has been executed and signed by all current parties**

This renewal rule is very poor
If you can, a star doesn’t want to give it
Then the car breaks in the parking lot when the winter break is broken. I feel that this place is not very safe.
Rent is expensive
In short, I don't recommend tanglewood.

Updated

They finally let my housemate renew the lease without my signature for the renewal of next school year, which I think it’s more reasonable. I appreciate that.

(Original)
**Roommate changes/takeovers will not occur until a lease renewal for 2019-2020 has been executed and signed by all current parties**

這個renewal的規定非常差
如果可以的話一顆星都不想給
然後winter break的時候車子停在停車場被人破壞 感覺這個地方也不是很安全
房租又貴
總之不好 我不推薦tanglewood

You are absolutely correct on the roommate release procedure. Although this procedure may seem drastic, and we apologize,  it is a common practice in the Davis market as it's necessary to start pre-leasing very early in the year to ensure availability for the following school year. All residents were informed of the roommate release process on their renewal notices posted back in January 2019 and was also included on all renewal reminder communication. Tanglewood encouraged residents to notify the office of these changes and are able to assist once your renewal agreement has been signed. Residents had from January 2019 to March 1st, 2019 to renew their lease agreement and request roommate changes. If you have any further questions that I can assist you with a renewal and roommate change please let me know.\nThank you,\nLayce Baker Magana - Community Director"}< /resp></record></dataset><record>

Very very good. You just need to go. Seriously and get a smoothie bowl. You won't regret it. But they moved to the market place area. Here's also some updated pictures. Don't even read another review or place. GO.</Review>

The best smoothie bowl I have had in my life. I’ve been here maybe 10 times, I come back any time I’m in the area. The acai is perfect, the topping with cacao nibs and coconut and fruit is on point. The granola is perfect.

I have travelled the world and tried acai bowls everywhere I go, they are my favorite food. Including (but not limited to): Bay Area spots, Hawaii, and my current location in Bali where acai bowls are served at every hipster cafe.

Hands down, my favorite acai bowl is from Kravabowl.</Review>

Ordered the cauliflower quinoa burger and it was literally just chucks of cauliflower and quinoa in between a bun. Not an actual burger. Would be great if there was an actual vegan burger option considering there are so many delicious possibilities. This menu item was not worth the cost. Paired it with sweet potato fries and they were soft and mushy. On a brighter note, also had the ProBowl which was really good.< /Text>

Prices are reasonable, and the bowels are huge. They have vegan and vegetarian warm veggie options in addition to the fruit bowls. Also serves meat. Best avocado toast I've had, and cheaper that most for the amount of food it contained. Ocean view and walk around town was lovely.</Review>

Great food questionable service.
The food was great. The menu was pretty diverse. It took a minute to make my decision due to the possibilities. I ordered a Hot Pastrami sandwich with fresh fruit.  The Pastrami was fresh with marinated onions. The fruit was ripe and full of flavor. The portions were decent so I ended up getting a to go box. That's where the three stars comes in. Upon approaching the order window a female employee was handing out an order. The men asked for extra sauce which she provide. Once she gave them their additional ranch, I asked for a to go box. The response I received was a stare and walk off. I questioned if I did something but was handed, no let's be clear slid a box across the counter. I made sure to keep continuous eye contact to ensure I was not reading the situation wrong and received that confirmation when I said thanks and received no response.
I'm not sure if she was having a bad day and pissed at her friends but it was obvious that she was irritated and taking it out on women customers, as opposed to men.  Or maybe she just didn't like me. Hmm</review>

<Text>Went here for breakfast, horrible food, the avocado toast was as hard as a rock, they served an English muffin plain with no butter or margarine (not even on the side and no jelly/jam on the table to use either). Scrambled eggs were rubbery, coffee tasted watered down, the best part of the meal was the sausage.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Deeeelicious. Huge portions (although it is a bit expensive) with fresh fruit piled on top, and amazing smoothies. They also have a new special bowl every so often. Very good. Good place to hang out with friends too.<//Text>

We were very disappointed when we when one Sunday. We looked online to see what time they close that day and it said 7pm. we got there 5till 6pm. and another lady and I got there at the same time and the lady working there was very RUDE and said they were already close and we both said there website said they close at 7pm. And she also said that was there summer hours. I felt that she should have still taken our order because it was there mistake for not changing it on there website. We own our own business and we would not turn away paying customer. You guys just lost a family of 6 customers. We would not recommend theses place):< /text>

<Review>The Kravabowl is actually inside the building that says Avila Market. It's in the back-left corner on the main floor, and you can also order normal food and beer at the same counter.

It was my first acai bowl so I have nothing to compare it to, but it was pretty yummy. Kind of like a berry smoothie in taste and texture (and in size! although in a bowl-shaped plastic cup rather than a taller smoothie-shaped cup), with various fruit/granola toppings.

Pricier than I expected (~$10 for a "regular"), but also larger volume of food than I expected. It's still going to be more expensive than a smoothie of the same size, but then again this is a beach-front shop so you kind of expect prices to be inflated.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80ecf837b7a750c1:0x7736c60e44edb6b5</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have enjoyed everything Finley community park has to offer. From the kiosk with ample seating to smaller party areas. Tennis, volleyball and basketball courts. The rec center is home the senior citizen activity center and meeting rooms of every size with kitchen facilities. Last but n o t least is the swim center with a shallow and deep pool.</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808438384efc937b:0x54cb20ecdd94d3b9<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Amazing. I worked the winter camp and it comfortably accommodated the entire camp. They have a lot of local art on the walls, which gives it a very homey feel, and even a senior wing. The amount of activities you can do here are insane, and most are inexpensive< /text>

<review>Finley Community Center has uniquely beautiful architecture that serves well for events and has pools that make swimming enjoyable for all ages. It has heritage oaks, vertical growing oaks, deciduous redwoods, and notably excellently planned landscaping to accentuate the location as a place to relax. Take in what Sonoma County and Santa Rosa in particular has to offer by utilizing Finley for any community gatherings and other outdoor experiences.<//review><user>118211049647485516120</user>< Gmap_id>

This is an important & critical community center that deserves our full & complete support!! Their excellent staff is consistently warm, friendly & helpful. They provide vital services to a broad spectrum of our community's residents. From seniors to scouts, from stamp collectors to artists & crafters, this is an ideal place to hold your meetings & get togethers!! As a member of the Santa Rosa Stamp Club, I can personally vouch for this superb facility!!<//Text>

<Review>Temporary shelter for Santa Rosa/ Tubbs Lane fire victims. Vince and I checked into this shelter and was treated kindly upon intake was offered drinks and assured a safe place to use while trying to attain some more permanent housing. Then fed some dinner and shown where other amenities can be found. Surely this is Gods grace on action.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>been here a couple of times since I am a coordinator for private events. In most cases I would not take time to comment on horrible service from an agency however, yesterday when I went to reserve a spot at a local park the Hispanic women was just judgemental attitude. First of all I was not aware of the fact that they were not affiliated with this park, instead of being courteous and direct me to the appropriate place to contact,  she just sat there with an unpleasant facial expression staring at me. I had to ask her after she blatantly said NO WE DON’T DEAL with that park, I said ok well do you happen to know who’s does and once again She responded very vague with a “yea” but that was it she didn’t bother to give me name or phone number or whom to contact, it was after the fact that a lady that was sitting behind her responded to my question and gave me the number and place and at the end of it as I am walking away irritated the Hispanic girl says “by the way there won’t be any reservations taken for the rest of the summer” I was so taken back that I dont think I have ever felt this annoyed by customer service!!! Suggestions:  Girl you need to change that attitude before it catches up to you!!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808438384efc937b:0x54cb20ecdd94d3b9<//gmapID></record>

As a regular lap swimmer for many years there are times when 3 are in a lane and one of the swimmers does not know about circling and yielding for the faster swimmers.

Went in to get some soccer gear for the kiddo. The employees were very friendly and helpful. They helped pick out the right size shin guards and talked about playing the game and their favorite professional players to my son. He really liked that, and I appreciated them sharing their love of the sport to get my son excited about it.</Review>

<review>Very good product selection and friendly helpful staff. Overall it is a nice store. Could use a little more lighting, it was a bit dark in some places. Good selection of most things and a surprisingly good selection of braces, for us older folk who play sports regardless of our age. Great kids selection of items also.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Went in to get some new shoes. Walked out with three new pair at a decent price. Their selection wasn't as large as a dedicated shoe store, but they had a good cross section of athletic shoes and I even found a pair of casual dress shoes appropriate to wear to work (where jeans and a polo shirt is acceptable dress). The people working there were friendly and efficient. Would definitely shop there again.</text>

Really nice staff. Big 5 doesn't carry the latest top end sporting goods, but it is a good discount sporting goods store. Make sure you look for discount coupons online, or sign up for their email and get at least 10% off your purchases.<//review>

Employees are helpful but the store is mediocre at best.  I made a return less than a week ago and the process was weak.  With receipt it took over 10 minutes.</text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>Of all the clothing subscription boxes, Trunk Club seemed the most safe since it is a Nordstrom company, known for exceptional customer service.

Unfortunately, Trunk Club falls severely short.

Pros:
The clothes are fairly priced - the same as what can be found on Nordstrom's website.
The process is very easy. Everything comes in a box with 5 days to review. Ship back returns in the same box with a prepaid label and closure adhesive.

Cons:
In a months time, the stylist assigned to the account changed 3x. Not sure if this was due to turnover.
Nordstrom's flexible return policy does not extend to Trunk Club, even though the same clothes are being sold on both Nordstrom and Trunk Club.

This review applies to the online service.<//text><user_id>115054812125529448730</user_id>< Date>

Poor selection... no offer upfront when store is having a sale an they are charging you retail price!!!
Would recommend just going to a store or Bloomingdales in store service is better and broader in scope!!<//Review>

I had an issue with 2 items where the quality did not last and Trunk Club will not take them back like Nordstrom would normally do. Vince shoes that I have had for a couple of months and a purse where the strap broke within 4 months. BEWARE!!!! Just buy from Nordstrom directly so you have the protection where you can return items if they are defective. I am honestly shocked at the customer service. It is also extremely hard to return items- you cannot simply take them back to a Nordstrom store. Why go through the headache? TERRIBLE practices as a Nordstrom company but one that does not have the same policies and practices that Nordstrom built its enitre company on from day one in Seattle!< /text></record>

<text>After waiting a year to finally try trunk club, I was pleasantly surprised they had a club House less than 5 miles from home. I set up an appointment and was paired with Annie. Upon arriving, my girlfriend and I were offered drinks and a seat by Paul. As soon as Annie walked in the door, my gf said "I like her style, I bet that must be Annie! " sure enough, it was!

Annie came and introduced herself, listened to everything I had to say about the style I was aiming for and how I needed her expert guidance, then she went off, only to return with many outfits that all seemed perfect! If something didn't fit right, she immediately went off in search of something better. 2.5 hours later, I left the store feeling like a new man.

The entire experience was fun, the staff is great, and the clothes are perfect!!! Thank you Annie and team Trunk Club!

Update:

While Annie is no longer with the company, I still do a lot of shopping here. Jessica is my new go-to stylist, can't recommend her enough!</text>< pictures>

Best shopping experience ever. Personal stylists help you find a great look for yourself. They make everything so easy. And the custom creations will make you look and feel like a million bucks.<//text>

< review>
Got a gift card here. I was super excited, bc I loved the idea of having stylists send you fashionable clothing in the mail. The catch is you have to stop by the store to get fitted and show them the style you prefer. Isn't it the point of the stylist to pick the clothes for you and if I don't like them I ship the clothes back?? I could do the same thing at any department store.<//review>

Place is pretty awful. Handler was rude and tried to lecture me about time appointments. The time I arrived was still within my time slot so why would it matter. That doesn't make any sense unless she just wanted to go back to doing nothing or I was interrupting her. And this is a place you spend thousands of dollars in and they treat you like crap. Oh well. Management take note. All she had to do was " well your late, let's get started".< /Text>

Such attention to excellent customer service, beautiful and comfortable surroundings, pampering with delectable treats while you sit in a designer chair, or sofa, and best of all stylist Carolyn Martin's taste in clothing puts you at ease knowing you will walk out of the Trunk Club with a selection of clothing that is just perfect for you.< /text>

I’m on my 2nd Trunk and so far would say it’s ok. It’s helping me to push the boundaries of what I would normally try on and I appreciate that. I was surprised by how right on my first Trunk was! All of it is drawing upon Nordstom but the inventory for Trunk Club isn’t the same inventory for Nordstrom so I had to purchase sizes not available from Trunk Club through Nordstrom or items on the Nordstrom website I’ve suggested to my stylist have had to be purchased from Nordstom. A drag because I cannot apply the styling fee to items purchased from Nordstrom because sizes or styles aren’t available on Trunk Club.

Some frustration stems from the timeline. There were only two days to review my 2nd Trunk online prior to shipping which caused my stylist to rush items in after I rejected some of the suggestions....and I didn’t get to review those items prior to the Trunk shipping. One of the items was on point, but the other was 100% acrylic, even though I’d specifically stated “no acrylic”. This indicates that stylists are working with some kind of Trunk minimum they need to hit regardless of whether items fit the criteria stated by the customer.....

Worth a try but definitely not perfect so far.< /text>

Takes a little while to get order... average 7-12 minutes. But that's okay, I guess perfection is worth the wait. Especially since the food is fresh, hot & tasty. That first bite was worth the stop.<//Text>

This is a solid location for the franchise. I always find the fries to be underdone for my taste, but I recently got a tip to order them "well done". Much better! Also, ask for fried onions.

Definitely makes for a satisfying meal after a day of wine tasting!< /review>

The line looked like it would take forever but they where really ontop of it and no complaints about what I got. Everything ok as correct? Love the secret menu! Anyways only downfall is I wish they had real Iced coffee. Some people only drink Iced or frapps. I can't stand hot coffee!!< /Text>

This particular location has a full time dining room person - Dave - who goes out of his way to make sure you have a great experience. The only downside is the parking, which can be stressful during busy hours; it seems that all In-N-Out burgers have the smallest parking lots.<//review>< Pictures>

Always a real nice change from the establishments. And you know that everything is fresh and freshly cut, including the potatoes.</Text>

<Text>The food and service are very good.  The menu is a little short basically burgers and fries and soda and milkshakes.  The Traffic is so bad that often I turn around and leave.< /Text><user_name>Alan Symcox<//user_name></record>

This location killed it! Food was nice and fresh. I ordered a double double anima style and they nailed it. The line was wrapped around the corner but well worth it! This location was prompt, clean, workers were polite.

Parking: plenty unless super packed.

Food: hot, fresh, and got my order right the first time.

I'm a Tampa girl so this was my 1st time having In-N-Out. My bf who used to live in Petaluma raves about it. The service was quick and the food was hot. The burger is a cross bedwetting a big Mac, having something similar to Mac sauce on it, and a double whopper since it had lettuce, tomato & onion on it. The burger was delicious! I'm not really a fan of their fries though, so I gave 4 stars instead of 5.</text>

<UserId.>108341231341418524257<//UserId.><Rating>5< /Rating><Text>The first time I had In N Out I was 11 years old. It was in 1969 at the drive thru on Arrow Hwy. in San Dimas, CA. The only other location was in Baldwin Park, CA.
I moved to Northern California in 1980. Really missed those great burgers!!
In the early 90s I heard In N Out was expanding to Nor Cal. I couldn't wait! Would it be the same?
I wasn't disappointed! Same great burgers, same menu, the only difference was that you could eat inside. The original locations were drive thru only.
I have had In N Out countless times over the years, but every single time I chomp into one I'm back to 1969. Sitting in a Plymouth station wagon with my brothers, sister and Mom and Dad, stomach growling, waiting for our turn at that drive thru window.

When I want a burger, I usually opt for a grass-fed one. BUT every now and then I get a craving for an In-N-Out burger.  They ARE pretty tasty 🙂.  I prefer to order inside; it's quicker and then I can eat at one of the sanitized outdoor tables. I must say that the"crew" are ALWAYS smiling and friendiy.</review>

Fast, family friendly, clean fast food, and a California classic. Fresh quality ingredients make these simple burgers truly delicious and always fresh cut fries just taste better. I love em animal style and there's a lot to try on the not so secret menu like the protein style burger. When you just need a really good simple burger nothing beats In-N-Out.<//text>

Simple, fresh, incredibly satisfying. These burgers rule. Try them “animal style .” Though the line to order was long, it went pretty quick. Worth the wait!!<//Review>

In my opinion In n Out is the best fast food place in the country. They have fresh food that tastes great. If you are visiting from out of state you gotta stop by and try it because it's a California staple.</text>

Always incredible and fresh! Not only do I, as a Californian, love it, but my British husband is now totally on board. He wasn't to sure the first time he tried it but it's grown on him and he even has a custom order now with chopped chilies, pickles, and whole grilled onion with well done fries! I get a double double with cheese and whole grilled onion only with light well fries. If you think I'm picky because I only get cheese and onion on my burger, then you're wrong. I could get salad on my burger, but you try it once without the lettuce and tomato and tell me it's not a deliciously different experience. I've also realized I love eating here more than almost anywhere else. After eating at a restaurant I think, I could have got in n out for less money and enjoyed it more! Also, the fries people like to hate on, are REAL fries. People just aren't used to what non-frozen fried potatoes taste like.</Review>

I'm not your typical Californian. I don't swoon at the thought of In and Out. But my hubby loves it. We go once in a great while. We live hours away from one, so since we were in Santa Rosa, I thought we'd have this for dinner.

At almost 8 PM on A Wednesday, it was a typical In and Out experience. Line around the building, out into the road. There must have been 30 cars at least, in front of us. I was convinced we would be there an hour.

The line moved surprisingly fast. We were literally in and out. Haha. Maybe 15 minutes to get through. There was a guy out there taking orders, so it would be ready when you got there.

I got the double double animal style. Yum! Extra everything. With grilled onions. It was delish. Actually better than I remember. I got animal fries, which has sauce, grilled onion and cheese. So good! And a large coke.

Hubby got a double single. (Double meat, single cheese). With regular fries, and a root beer. We scarfed it down. It was pretty darn good.

We asked for no tomato on my hubbys, because if he eats any seeds, it can make him really sick. But, they put tomato. We also asked for a handful of sauce packets. The guy handed us one. Haha. They must take it out of his pay or something.

It was a great meal. Yummy.</Review>

Great place where you can always rely on good food and probably one of the only places you can still use the bathroom during the pandemic. Which is great if you are traveling. The parking lot at this location can get a bit congested would be the only negative.<//Review>

<review>I was there a couple of weeks ago with my girlfriend & we were in line waiting in the drive thru to get our food. The cashier at the first window’s name was Tony. He was one cool guy. He was very respectful to me and my girlfriend and I don’t live in Santa Rosa my girlfriend does. We went here to go eat dinner. I called In N Out & made a good complaint I hope Tony got the message. I’ll for sure will be coming back here again.< /review><user>112188663868885590077<//user><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Their burgers are pretty good and hecka cheap but the drive thru lines get kinda ridic. Pretty typical for in n out... It has its own left turn lane out on the street that backs up into the intersection a block away. Ya might want to park down the street and walk in.</Text>

Always busy, I like it that they provide jobs for young people, the food is always fresh (has not been sitting under a heat lamp for ?) and the prices are lower than other chains who spend on ads/promotions. A tasty burger, fries, cola can't be beat. Easy freeway access, close to center of town, late hours, always clean. I shop other burger chain stores occasionally but they don't have the consistency of I & O. Yum!<//Text>

I ordered a meal here today around 6pm and by the time it was handed to me the fries were cold, not just barely warm but actually cold. My cheese burger was cooked well but the bun was also cold to the touch. I've been here many times and have never had any complaints so I'm hoping this is an isolated incident. I will be going to the Rohnert Park drive through next time. Disappointed in this meal. On a positive note the staff was friendly as always.<//Review>

I thought I hated In-N-Out Burger, but then I went to this one and have been back several times since. It's always delicious. They've only messed up once by giving us 2 vanilla shakes instead of chocolate, but everyone makes mistakes sometimes!</Text>

<review>This was my first visit to an In-N-out Burger, I heard from Swedish friends they have the best burgers.
But the place was packed with people, such long lines, no where to sit, long wait for the food, the shouting in the speakers from the staff was very disturbing. So even if the cheeseburger and milkshake was very good, all the other things drag the review down.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN7NNsZ9sWRdK4-nOF7hautA7x7u8V2Yoen34Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x8084388c86efee91:0x8c755c5baeb27781</gmap_id></record>

If you've never been to an In-N-Out, and you aren't looking for a "gourmet" burger, give it a try. The menu is limited to burgers (you can get a grilled cheese), fries and shakes, BUT they have perfected what they sell. My other main reason for liking In-N-Out is that the employees are always smiling. VERY family friendly.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Generic review, as opposed to location specific, as in my opinion, in-n-out have done a good job of providing exactly the same experience wherever you go. If you have never heard of in-n-out....they are a burger joint. Freshly cooked, high volume, high throughput. Famous for their basic no frills menu and their extensive a la carte "secret menu" that everyone knows about. IMHO, good burgers.< /Review>

We got to the cash window (no mask) and once we got to the food window the employee I think his name was Zac said it so rude. “Put your mask on” and while the window was still open was talking rudely about us and cussing and everything. I understand it is a law but when we have gone to all the locations in this county and not once have been told to put on our mask in their drive thru and it’s 11pm at night after just spending 7 hours in the emergency room for pregnancy pains.

Good fresh and fast food. Fast service.
The only issue is that people (the employees) keep talking about politics.</Text>

Amazing food, but what really stands out is the customer service here. David working in the dining area was so friendly and welcoming. Saying hi to everyone, sitting with a lonely customer, taking moms trash for them. All that and more during our short lunch.< /Text>

Always love coming here. There is always one employee that walks around making sure everyone is happy and thanks them for coming in. This place is consistent, clean and yum! Never had a bad experianse and I don't think I ever will. That's why it's always packed!

I'm hungry now...</Review>

<text>Way too crowded.  The burgers are great and at a good value but not worth the wait and noise. The bathrooms are spacious, updated, and clean and there's plenty of parking. The drive thru is almost always crowded with the line out to the street but, due to the location of the restaurant, it doesn't impede on traffic or cause too many traffic safety issues as does some other In-N-Out locations. Recently, there has been a security guard patrolling the parking lot. Not sure why but it kinda causes some concern as to the safety of the patrons if there is a need for security.<//text><Resp>None</Resp></record>

Im from the south and this was my first time trying In-N-Out, I wasnt honestly impressed. I thought the food was decent but didnt warrant all the hype ive heard for years. Maybe I just tried the wrong location? Will definitely be open to trying agin though to make sure this wasnt a fluke experience.<//review>

As a fan of the franchise, I already have a decent idea of how the stores tend to be like. However this one in particular had superb service. Obviously there were long lines and crowded seats, but the one kicker of this location in particular was a certain gentleman who greeted nearly every customer at the door, politely opening the door for guests, walking about the store and cleaning up any messes, making polite compliments, and asking guests how their experience is so far, like a more formal restaurant. This alone made the experience absolutely exquisite for an In N Out experience. Highly recommend visiting this store in particular, hopefully so you too may meet the fine gentlemen I met.</Text>

Who doesn't love the classic environment of In-N-Out Burger? I always enjoy having a double-double with an order of fries and of course the awesome spread that is unique to the In-N-Out Burger experience. regardless of the lines that can get backed up in the drive-thru, they always manage to serve you in a timely manner.</Review>

- Mustard fried (patty)
- Whole grill (onion)
- Bun extra toast or tomato wrap in lieu of bun

Dining time is definitely need to wait, parking sometime is little bit of a headache. If you prefer walk in to order in a busy time. Is possible to find some street parking across the street. Drive though in peak hour will be a long line. But normally drive through is always faster.< /review></record>

<Review>First timer from the East coast. You guys have something here. A really good fast food burger with excellent service. We were in Santa Rosa California at lunch hour. The place was so hammered, we almost didn't stop. Lines at the counter moved fast, but I wasn't rushed when my turn came. During my short wait I got the best treat....watching the behind the counter/kitchen performance. Well trained and executed. An older employee, David, was wandering the eat in area, checking on customers, offering pickles, and engaging in friendly conversation when a customer seemed open to it. 35 minutes to get in-N-out during lunch. A very good value for the area as well. If all of your stores operate this way, we'll be seeing you soon.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

It's the first time I've ever seen a live menu EmazingLights although the line was long and still it moves pretty fast! In the only thing I got was a milkshake for my dog and I and it tastes like an old fashioned milkshake. Thank you very much< /Review>

You can skip the buns and go for a lettuced burger, still delicious. However, you have to eat the fries in the 4 minutes after purchase, or you’ll munch on cardboard with salt. All in all, my favorite fast food in Cali.< /Text>

Great food! The reason I'm not giving it another star is because most of the time, THE LINES ARE LONG AS FRICK. I got lucky and got no line the day I came. The inside of the place is cool. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for an *iconic* burger</review>

Double double protein style has saved my life 4387 times in the last 15 years. Find the closest in n out near you. Move there (walking distance preferred) visit all the time. Life your best life. :). Neopolitan shakes ftw!< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>West Coast classic. My go-to order: double-double animal style, french fries, and a neapolitan shake. You will not find tastier fast* food with friendly service for less than at In-n-Out.

* In-n-Out is definitely not the fastest of fast food. Get ready for a wait when busy, which is pretty much always.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Real, fresh-cooked food for cheaper than McDonald's. Never disappointed there. I feel fuller when eating there than I do at other fast food places, and that's because they don't use preservatives or filler in their meats!< /review>

I am from Ohio, and was excited to try this legendary place.

The burgers were not all that special to me, even animal style. Too much lettuce and not much flavor.

Their animal fries are amazing!

The parking is mostly a nightmare

I prefer a burger from Five Guys but not their fries. The wait at Five Guys is better and so are the burgers, but their fries don't compare. It depends which you like better.<//review>

Huh...???  Why tell others when EVERYBODY already knows what a Fantastically YUMMY place this is!
I mean, as packed with customers as In & Out ALWAYS is, that would be like "Cut'n My Nose To Spite My Face," wouldn't it?
The employees ARE Friendly, Silly & quite Professional at the same time. Always a pleasure to watch a "Winning Team" in action.
Thank you ALL, (BOTH Locations)

Always a classic. I love that they have a non-burger option available, the grilled cheese is amazing. For a simple menu, there’s still a lot to choose from. Wait times are consistent with other locations, always long at peak times but the food is worth the wait.< /review>

In-N-out burger is honestly the best chain fast food restaurant. The fries are perfect and have just the right amount of salt. Also, unlike Burger King, the paddies are not just frozen paddies or packaged cheese.</review>

Great prices and friendly staff that's open late. The food tastes pretty fresh. You can watch them cut the fries. While a good establishment I find this place very overrated. They don't offer a large variety of food options. Unless you order any of your food "animal style" it really  has no taste. The fries need better oil and some salt. The burger patties are pretty bland. You also usually have to wait up to 30 mins in the drive thru line. Not really worth the wait.<//Review>

Who doesn't love In-N-Out Burger?! Great location and down-right delicious food! Ok, so maybe vegans don't like In-N-Out... unless it's their cheat day! Yup, everyone love it!</review>

When the inside is closed due to the pandemic and the guy taking orders in the drive thru cause the lines backed up to the street on a hot day starts to walk back inside tells you "no i can't get you a cup of water" when askes politely but then walks out almost immediately after going in holding a cup of water just to drink it in front you</review>

< review>
Visiting some of my family here and they decided to “treat” me to the In and Out. David (who works at the I&O) greeted us at the door and made sure my 89 year old mother got the best and closest table. He was so great and really made the visit. I was treated to animal fries (very different and definitely delicious) and a big juicy cheeseburger all the way.
A simple menu makes it easy to quickly decide what to order. Not wordy and complicated like those other places.
It’s no wonder why the I&O is such a great success...great food, smiling people working there, and a menu that’s just a little different from all the other places.
It’s one of those places you can go to five times a month and never get tired of the food.
Five stars every day for this place.

<userid>108817290677587938308<//userid><Review>It's probably the best fast food chain burger. It's just a very tasty burger. Gordan Ramsay likes em and he seems pretty selective. I used to hate the fries but they grow on you. They cut em up and make em fresh right in front of you and you can really taste the potato. They taste like they were alive at some point which is more than I can say about other burger places. If you've never been you should really go at least once, just to see what the fuss is all about.< /Review><date>1519797272510< /date><Gmap_id>0x8084388c86efee91:0x8c755c5baeb27781<//Gmap_id>< Pics>

Definitely the best quality of a fast food place, if you can really call it that. It's got a drive through but, while it isn't exactly slow, it's definitely not fast. The service is great too, always very friendly and they know all the orders so they are good at managing alterations to the standards. Even without that they'd still absolutely be worth the wait just for the burgers they have :)< /text>

I'd like to know who doesn't like In-N-Out? Vegetarian/Vegans don't count.  I'm talking to the meat people. Whether you're a health nut (don't get fries and opt for a bun-less burger with "Protein Style") or a Quarter pounder freak (grab a "Double Double", Triple Triple, or whatever number your heart desires) In-N-Out burger will do you right.

Animal style adds mustard, diced grilled onions, and pickles onto your burger or fries (sans pickles/mustard) while grilled cheese sandwiches, protein style burgers and I'm sure others don't quite make the menu.  Some secrets have to remain, but who says you can't have it "your way" at this burger joint?< /Text>

Food is great here, they get the order perfect 95% of the time. Only issue is long drive through times, due to a large crowd being here at literally all hours of day. Don't go in drive through if you don't have 20 minutes to spare. Going inside is almost always much quicker.< /Review>

<text>It is In N out. What can you say? The food is consistent, the people are unfailingly friendly. They have no issue qith changing every last item for your food allergies, prefrences or because you like some freaky combination of tasty fast food. It is busy because they are all busy. But the food is fresh and you don't wait all that long.<//text></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>A great place for a burger.  You should always order it animal style.  "In-N-Out Burger is an American regional chain of fast food restaurants with locations primarily in the Southwest and the Pacific coast.[3] It was founded in Baldwin Park, California, in 1948 by Harry Snyder and Esther Snyder. The chain is currently headquartered in Irvine, California and has expanded outside Southern California into the rest of California, as well as into Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Texas, and Oregon. The current owner is Lynsi Snyder, the Snyders' only grandchild."  Wikipedia 2019<//review>< pictures>

<review>The drive-through line is always long, winding like a snake through the parking lot, and sometimes backed out onto the street. But fear not, they are very, very quick. My go-to order: cheeseburger animal style, regular fries, Neapolitan shake. The best. I have to limit myself to one visit a week, which is hard because I work in the area.< /review>< Pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>My favorite fast food yet!!!   It's soooooooo busy it's not in and out, but find a parking spot, wait in line to place your order, and find a seat.  That's the fast part.  Then you wait 5 (if you're lucky) to 20 minutes waiting for your delicious double double with fries and vanilla milkshake to arrive.  When it finally arrives your in heaven!!! The quality and price are amazing!!!  When you leave it's a breeze!!  Is the 10 minute to 30 minute wait worth it?? Yes!!!</text>< pictures>

I can't remember why I used to like this burgers, the fries were soggy and tasteless the same as my burger, I had a completely different image of In-N-Out, I don't know if they changed or it was me but I didn't like it at all.</Text>

There is no doubt how popular this place is when it takes 20 min. Just to get into the drive way; let alone the drive through. Yes I did wait. It's that good!< /Review>

If you've been to an In-N-Out burger before, this location is exactly like most other locations. Same layout, same hats, same food, same beverages, not as much parking as you want, and many more people inside than the parking seemed to suggest.

If you haven't been to In-N-Out before, then you may as well try it here since everybody raves about it in California, and if you don't go now, somebody will probably want to take you later. The food tastes more fresh than most fast food places (some of my friends would probably get angry for me just calling it fast food), but it's not like insanely good. The prices are reasonable, the shakes are good (vanilla is bae), and the fries are good. I like to eat a pepper with my burger, but the peppers are spicy so be warned. The lemonade here is sweet, but it tastes good as well.

If you're a tourist, may as well ask them at the front for one of those hats as well. Or get it for the kids.

Why 5-star if I think it's so overrated? People talk about it like it's a 7/5, but really, it's just good fast food. I rate it 5/5 for fast food, not for some fancy anniversary dinner.</text>

Usually good but very crowded most times. Quick service but often hard to find parking in lot. Watch out for the panhandlers in the bushes next to drive through. Food good and seems well run.<//Review>

Absolutely an event if mayham to go that being said food is hot fresh and taste great it just takes 15 to 30 min to get your order. That's after 15 to 30 to park and 5 to 20 to back out and leave<//Text>

<Text>What do you want me to say? In n out is fantastic, and this chain site doesnt dissapoint! Absolutely delicious and great staff. Great facility too. Just be cautious about when you come in. If it during rush hours or after work times (4 to 7 pm workdays) expect rhe drive thru to be a +45 min wait. At that point you might as well go inside. The drive thru can circle all the way around and to the street 😂😂 honestly it is just a testimony how great this place is.

One of the better burgers around.  It's gettingbreally busy here.  Think they need to open another.  Avg wait time in drive thru is already 20min but worth the wait< /text>

Of course they're awesome. Usually long lines, drive thru line sometimes complicates parking. Outdoor seating. Next to gas station on corner. There are off menu items, in case you haven't heard, like "animal style". Also Atkins lettuce burger, tell them gluten allergy and they'll accommodate your order.</Text>

Always a good time, the guys taking orders for the drive thru need a raise, very professional. A homeless man yelled at our guy while he was taking our order, but he still repeated the order back flawlessly. Impressive considering it was an order for 4 people with all their various preferences.<//Review>

It's a good burger, that's for sure. The fries were a little salty for my taste. My meal price was extremely reasonable and the people were polite. However, the 20 min wait in drive-thru isn't worth it.<//Text>

I am an east coast man primarily but while I travel alot I have never been to an in n out. With that said, I'll never go to another. I do not see what the hype is all about. 5 guys has them beat hands down. The french fries are wierd almost like the texture of pringles which I've always wondered if they're even real potatoes. The burger was fine but nothing to write to your mother about. My wife didnt even eat most of her food. Dont waste your money.<//Review>

<review>I live in orcutt and I'm a volunteer SAR member. Unfortunately they forgot my remaining items to my order due to the fact that I was being called out. Unfortunately when I came back around to retrieve the rest of my order they ignore my presence and continue on. As a loyal customer this was a shock!<//review>< Pictures>

I love the fact that they slice their french fries right in front of you and you can see that they are from REAL potatoes, and oh so delicious. I like how you can see EVERYTHING being prepared. Best of all the price is right too. If you haven't tried In -N- Out burger you owe it to yourself to please your palette.</Text>

Great that a young man takes the orders outside so our food is expedited, but if your going to require someone to stand outside in cold weathet to take orders,  the least you could provide is an outside heater.</Review>

Their hamburger patties have some substance and taste fresh and all the toppings make for a delicious burger. In the past I have not been impressed with fries at other locations which were limp amd soggy despite being made from fresh cut potatoes. But this location has it down! Delicious crispy fries! The shakes are nothing exciting (I grew up on Burgerville milkshakes, sorry). There is also a secret menu which I rarely order from but I'm sure you could Google. I do know you can ask for grilled onions on your burger and I have tried the "Animal Style" fries which are pretty good (smothered in fry sauce and grilled onions). Plan ahead for a bit of a wait. There's usually a line at the drive thru and a slightly shorter line inside.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><rate>5</rate><GmapID>0x8084388c86efee91:0x8c755c5baeb27781<//GmapID><Name>Jessica Leavitt<//Name><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

Love it all the way. I always order double double protein style (wrapped in lettuce) and animal fries (fries with American cheese and spread). It is the perfect combination.< /Review>

Pretty standard in'n'out, honestly. Parking is a bit lacking, but the service is fast and friendly, the food is exactly what I expect, and there's a comfort in the familiarity of a place being EXACTLY what you expect!<//review>

This gets a 4.9.  They could earn a 5 if they would only find a way to get rid of the lines.  Nevertheless, the lines indicate the popularity of the food.  You always know what you will get here.  Of course, one can't forget to mention the real ice cream milkshakes.  I better head to In N Out right now...< /review>

What can I say, it's In-n-Out, awesome burgers your way all the time. Go with my favorite, double double with Animal fries and an Arnold Palmer with a slice of lemon. For fun get yourself a grilled cheese with onions and pickels.</review>

What can I say? Consistent In-n-out resto. Friendly, helpful staff, limited menu made with good quality ingredients. The entrance is hidden, very frustrating, but even worse is the horror of a parking lot that is confusing, always full, and hard to turn around in, especially if there are a lot of truck-nut style pickups in the lot.  But I love the friendly, helpful service, freshness and consistentcy. Good for late nights rather than lunch due to parking frustration.</review>

When you gotta have it, you gotta have it. Hopefully you don't gotta have it during normal meal times, because the drive thru line is a thing. It's the only one in Santa Rosa, and parking there can be an exercise in controlling your road rage.<//text>

I'm from Mississippi and have always heard about In-n-Out Burgers. We were in Rohnert Park and the nearest one was too busy so we drove to Santa Rosa and ate at that one! Best burgers and sauce I've ever had!!</text>

< Review>
In N Out is IMO the best fast food burger anywhere in the world.  That being said this is only true if your willing to eat a double patty cheese burger. Single patty cheese burger is a B+.. Protein style cheese burger is a solid B, and a burger with out cheese i would never eat so i can't speak to that.</Review>

If you don't know what In-N-Out Burger is, a trip to one of their stores should be the next thing you do. Just stop what you're doing and go get a Double Double, because whatever other Hamburgers you have been eating (with a few exceptions) were full-stop worse that what you can get here.

This store is just as nice as any other In-N-Out. The service is generally quite fast except at peak evening hours.</Text>

It was my first trip to the west coast,and all I've ever heard was that I needed to try In and Out burgers. We tried them,and it was ok. The French fries were very soggy,needed t ok be fried for a much longer period of time.</Review>

No discussion, if you want a good burger, this is the place. If you opt to have the "secret sauce" on the side, you can taste how good they are straight up.👍< /review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>What's not to say? This iconic chain burger joint is always a crowd pleaser. Always go animal on the burgers. If you've never had animal fries, now's the time to try them. Their shakes are pretty decent. My favorite is the neopolitan shake. All three flavors in one shake. Enjoy!< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

In N Out has excellent food compared to other fast food chains. They have a simple menu that they stick to, and though it may be a small menu they stick to it and do it well.</Review>

OMG, build a few of these in Omaha will ya? By far the best fast food burger ever made. Best fries. Happiest staff. Smilingest customers (if not a word, add it to the dictionary just for In & Out). Cleanest too. Love this place...are six stars available?</Review>

Average In-N-Out. Very friendly staff, accommodating kitchen and staff, and equally tasty burgers. Clean washroom and tables.</review>

The design of the parking lot does not meet the demand of the customers. The drive through needs to be routed a different way; the people in the drive through are blocking people from leaving the parking lot.< /Review>

<review>What can be said? It's In-n-out and it's the best!
The parking can be a little cramped at busy times, so you will have to park across the street, but the short walk is well worth.
You can expect a relative wait time depending on what time of day it is, but that is because every other person in town is coming here for lunch or dinner.</review><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

Im not a fan of in and out. Lets get that out of the way. I don't see what the hype is all about. They have average food like any other fast food joint. If the food is so good then why are they just a regional restaurant?< /Review>

One of the few last remaining chains that hasn't gone megagodzilla on us and our environment. The food is better than most fast food venues and the help is as scrumptious as the meal - stellar service and great prices.<//Text>

Poorly designed parking lot and drive through. The cars in line for the drive through block a large portion of the parking lot, making it very difficult to get in and out.</Review>

While food and staff are great trying to enter and exit the parking lot is a nightmare. The restaurant draws crowds larger than it can handle and the adjacent areas are littered with trash from their drive through. I wish they would redesign their entrance and exit not having the dive through line snake through the parking lot effectively blocking access to restaurant.<//Review>

Along with their consistent burger making, this one has a decent outdoor area with a few tables.</review>

New to the west coast but In-N-Out lives up to the hype from my west coast friends.

Fresh ingredients, quick service, cheap prices. Can't come out west without an In-n-out trip.< /Text>

<review>Always busy, parking is limited, especially because of the way the drive-thru and street traffic is structured. Noisy, crowded interior that is about 80% college and high school students, but usually everyone is friendly. The food is worth it, value and taste wise. Just go already.< /review><UserId.>116680729866839438656<//UserId.></record>

15 cars in the drive thru and a full parking lot everyday. It took me longer to pull out of my space than it took to get the burger that was luke warm by time I could eat it. Waste of your time if you ask me<//text>

<Review>This is a fast food place,only hamburgers are served,they are delicious I have severe food issues but
I CAN eat these hamburgers without any problems.Prices are unbelievable,
From $2.30 to $3.75 for one hamburger,
Coffee is only $1.25 served in a large cup and it is delicious.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><gmapID>0x8084388c86efee91:0x8c755c5baeb27781< /gmapID></record>

(Translated by Google) It is in my opinion the best burger, I love the taste. Another detail that I like is that they are well organized to be able to attend us as quickly as possible due to the drive-thru and the attitude of the people who work there is very good.
