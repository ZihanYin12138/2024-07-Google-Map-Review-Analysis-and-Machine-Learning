I really like Dr. Lahijani and always look forward to my visits. She explains everything that she does in clear language that is easy to understand and takes her time, you never feel rushed out. Everyone at the office is helpful and polite. I recommend her to EVERYONE.< /review>

Her staff are friendly and professional, her office is spacious and clean, and appointments are not hard to get. If there is a wait, it is only because she and her staff take the time to answer patient questions, explain processes, and address your concerns. I truly appreciate her expertise and professionalism. I think it speaks to her character that two of her staff members have been with her for as long as I’ve been a patient.</text>< pics>

Dr. Lahijani has been my Optometrist for over 15 years.  She is caring and is the ultimate professional. Ruth and her Team are also excellent and have provided me with fabulous service over all of these years. I come back from my appointments here even after I have relocated!

Thank you.< /Text>

<Review>Wait time was normal (if there is such a thing during a pandemic)— staff was friendly and helpful.

Doctor Lahijani was very warm, thoughtful, and thorough with her explanations.

I had a very positive experience— will return for my next checkup, and would absolutely recommend this practice to a friend!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1616643714632, 'text': 'We are happy to hear that you had a great experience!'}< /resp><UserId.>117091206603860967860</UserId.>< gmap_id>

A very accessible place to see a doctor for eye check up. The place is awesome more space not crowded.
I will always recommend Dr. Shermin to all my friends and families. A very prestige doctor I ever had.< /Review>

I hadn’t been to the eye doctor in 6 years. Not only is their staff attentive and friendly, but they make sure they keep their clients safe and their office clean. They are taking all precautions which made me feel comfortable and the whole process was easy. Yes you may have to wait but it’s better to wait and be taken care of than rushed and not get quality help. Thank you guys for being amazing with me and even getting to see my son as well.< /Text>

I love their new location. Dr L is amazing. I will follow her whenever she goes. I will bring my family to get seen by her in the coming weeks. Very professional and easy going. I have always had a great experience and look forward to my visits with Dr L and her staff. I felt safe coming here as they have safety measures they are following and have the entire place sanitized constantly.</Review>

Everyone in this office is super professional and knowledgeable. Dr. Lahijani is so wonderful and patient and I really enjoy my appointments with her. She takes the time to address all my problems and I never feel rushed or uncomfortable. She makes suggestions as to what is best to purchase if I need lubricating eye drops and also doesn’t push expensive eye glasses on me but will suggest only what my insurance will actually cover and explains the difference between bifocals, progressives and just getting two separate pairs for driving and reading and what will be covered by my insurance and if I need any additional treatments to the glasses like scratch resistance or glare prevention etc. I also appreciate that they took all the necessary steps to insure that I was not exposed to anyone else who might be infected with COVID. Everyone had to wait outside and before coming inside they had their temperature checked and one person at a time was let in for their appointment. I would definitely recommend this office and especially Dr. Lahijani.</review>

I have been knowing them for 7 years now. I took my daughter first and now my other child and myself.
Great service, very polite and professional.
I felt protected when I visit their new location. With the health regulations now days, they sanitize and take everyone's temperature at the time they check in. Thank you for going the extra mile. I definitely recommend Hollywood Optometrist and will keep coming to them.<//Review>

Everyone here is great!
They are professional yet warm and caring.
I’ve never had to wait for more than a few minutes to see the doctor and/or technician and am always treated with the utmost respect and patience.
The offices are clean, clean, clean!!
Can not recommend enough.<//review>

<review>Such an excellent place for an eye exam and for purchasing eyewear. From the ladies at the front desk to those who do the fitting and those who help you decide on frames to the optometrist, they are friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. I had a hard time deciding on the frames, but they were very patient and they had an amazing deal on a 2nd pair. Dr. Lahijani puts you at ease immediately and answers all questions. Shout out to David, Karla and Jocelyn for their kindness. Love my new glasses!!<//review><resp>{'time': 1592324764569, 'text': 'It is our honor to serve you!'}< /resp>< pictures>

The Staff and Dr. Lahijani were very professional & following the COVID19 guidelines perfectly. Of course, Dr. Lahijani took care of my problem as quickly as possible.  I am waiting for my new pair of glasses with the better vision now. Looking forward to it.
Thank you very much 🤓</Review>

I went to do a DMV Vision exam check out and I got to learn a lot about my vision needs. The exam was easy and the staff makes everyone feel welcome. I love how they make you feel safe during this pandemic. They sanitized everything you touch before some else uses the machines, setting area, etc. Thanks you soo much<//text>

I had the most pleasant experience during my visit. The place is neat and the staff was extremely friendly and professional. Now the doctor was so down to earth that we started chatting about everything except eyes. She's so cool. Don't look any further, this is the place. Make you appointment today.< /Review>

Amazing team! I was seen quickly the staff all knew what was covered on my insurance and were extremely helping me choose my frames! Dr. L is a star, listening to all my concerns and going above and beyond bring me care and made sure I understand my eye health!< /text>

<review>I make an appointment,and ask for the cost on eye contacts was told 75. But Dr want to charge 130 making excuses that she need to do also for glasses
And I must pay for everything. I been wearing contacts for 20 years never heard of additional charge normally is included in the first charge.< /review><Time>1598629658918<//Time><Response>{'time': 1598635284929, 'text': 'I apologize for the misunderstanding of our fee structure.

<review>Hollywood Optometrist has a great selection of the newest style frames. Dr. Shermin does a thorough examination. The staff is always friendly and helpful and take the time to ensure you get what you came in for. It makes my life easy going to one place that has both a great optometrist on hand along with frames versus other places where the doctor is meh and selection is great or vice versa. One stop shop!</review>< UserId.>

Dr. Lahijani has been my optometrist for over 10 years.  I started going to her for my eye care out of convenience, but very soon after it was because of her gentle, caring attitude towards me and her extensive knowledge.  That along with her great staff has kept me coming back all this time, even though I have to travel 20 miles.  It's like going to visit an old friend.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.</Text>

Dr. Lahijani is very detailed ans really gives you information you need to know about your eye exam. She reccomends the right type of glasses and contact lenses for you.

The staff of the office is really friendly and accomodating!</review>

I recently had my eye exam with Dr. Lahijani.  She is very experienced and knowledgeable.  The frame selection is extensive.  Their prices on frames are also reasonable.  I will definitely go back again to see her.< /text>

< Review>
I hate to do this, but I had a rather terrible experience with them recently. This is aimed more at the staff out front than the actual optometrists, because they're both fantastic! So I had found their website (which one of them claims doesn't exist) and I went ahead and asked for an appointment. They promptly e-mailed me back with an available time and I agreed to it. I showed up at my appointment time and let the man know I was there for it, and he proceeds to tell me that I didn't make an appointment. So I inform him that I did, and tell him I made the appointment online. Nope, nothing. I'm furious at this point because I had been in dire need of new glasses (See my other review about Woori Optical) and I come to find out that I have no appointment and the person behind the desk has no idea that they even had a website. So he gives me an appointment at a later time that day, and I've settled down a bit, and I leave. That was the worst experience I've had there. The rest of the staff out front can be rude and give off an attitude, though, so just a warning.

The doctors themselves are both wonderful women, and are very attentive and make sure to ask a lot of questions. They remember who you are and even things you've told them, which is really great, it just shows they care.

I just implore the both of them to get better staff, I understand why this wouldn't be considered, but when you have employees who don't even know you have a website, where you take appointment requests over E-mail that goes to you, and the other two have a tendency to be extremely rude to patients who may not be able to articulate themselves better due to a language barrier, something must be done about it.<//Review>

I cannot say enough about Dr. Lahijani and her whole staff. They are friendly, efficient, and very trustworthy. I'm particularly sensitive when it comes to my eyes (I always have been since I was a kid), and Dr Lahijani put me right at ease. This means so much to me, I highly recommend her.</text>

<rate>5</rate><text>I have been coming to this dentist for 10 years. Having switched insurances/dentists and moved all over SoCal, I can confidently say that Dr. Tatulyan is absolutely the most gentle and skilled dentist I have been to. He spends time with each patient and really explains how to best proceed given your specific situation. You can tell he really cares about his patients rather than simply trying to promote the business side of his practice. If you are looking for a family dentist in the valley this is the ONE. Not to mention it’s conveniently located down the street from Cleveland and other schools.<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Dr. Tatulyan totally gave me my life back.  He is wonderful!  I’ve been seeing him for years, I trust him 200%.  Years back I had a crown done for my front tooth but it was paper white making it very obvious I had a fake tooth.  Recently I made the decision to have it redone with   Dr Tatulyan and I love it!!! I now smile without being self conscious.  Him and his team are amazing! My family and I aren’t going anywhere as long as he is around.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I've been seeing Dr. Tatulyan and his team for a while and refuse to go anywhere else. The team is absolutely incredible; they're thoughtful, gentle, kind, funny, interested in their patients, and passionate about their work. Not only are they incredible people, but they're also fantastic at their jobs. Dr. Tatulyan is quick and nimble, each time I've gone in for anything it's been completely painless. They're wonderful and I highly recommend!< /Text><user_name>Gillian Evenas< /user_name><Rating>5<//Rating>< time>

<review>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Super friendly and professional staff. Extremely accommodating and attentive to the patients. I always learn something new about general oral care that can be applied at home to keep my teeth healthy. I remember I had misplaced my receipt after a visit. I called the office and asked if there was any way they are able to reprint it, they told me sure and I can pick it up at my follow up appointment which was coming up in a couple weeks. When I got to my follow up appointment, the receptionist handed me the sheet to sign in and my receipt. She already had it printed and ready for me. I didn’t have to remind anyone or anything. Simply amazing customer service. Definitely glad I started coming here.</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<user>116803608301779096689<//user><review>I have been with this office for over a year now and can say that they are the best office I've attended. The staff always makes a point to remember your name and give you goodie bags after each visit. The doctor has one of the best "bedside" manners I have ever encountered in dentistry. He will explain each step in detail and why it is important while making sure that it is comprehensible. I absolutely recommend if you are looking for a new dental office.</review><name>Chris L</name>< time>

The Best Dentist I ever had in my life. Dr. Tatulyan is so caring, knowledgeable, and very gentle. I never felt any pain on deep cleaning, root canals, wisdom teeth removal and fillings. He is very caring doctor, for him patients are very important be without pain. Once i had very bad pain it was his day off he opened his office for me. I only recommend DR.Tatulyan, he is number 1 doctor. Also his assistants Pinkie and Rachel are the best. Love them all. Thanks to my doctor for my healthy teeth!<//review>

I highly recommend this dentistry clinic. My family and I have been coming here for years. Dr. Tatulyan and his entire staff are wonderful. Everyone is so kind, caring and helpful, It’s always a pleasure coming to my check ups. What I love most is that Dr. T takes his time explaining each step to what he’s about to do. During procedures he continues to talk you through what he’s doing which definitely helps me keep calm and comfortable. So if your looking for a great dentist, look no further, Sterling Smile is honestly one of the best 😁</Text>

Best place in to get your dental care.
Dr. Tatulyan is a true professional. He always explains what he is doing and makes sure that you have a pleasant and comfortable experience.  And, I can't say enough about the staff. They always greet you with a smile and work with you to get you the most convenient appointment for you. Everyone makes you feel like family.< /Review>

I have been going to Dr. Tatulyan for many years now and can say that he is a true dedicated professional dentist which I have had excellent results and great experience with.
He works with you on a  budget and insurance coverage and never tries to sell you procedures which may be costly and unnecessary.
One of his best qualities I really appreciate is his gentle touch, you never feel the pain in his care and I could almost say that local anesthesia is not even needed for most the procedures.
I recommend him to anyone looking for a great dentist!< /text>

<Review>This office was recommended to me by a friend. It is, by far, the best dental office I've ever visited. Dr. Tatulyan and his wonderful staff are extremely caring, and make you feel the most comfortable about having dental work done. The doctor is very detail oriented, gentle, and will let you know exactly what he is doing step by step. I really appreciate that the staff has made me feel like as if I am their only patient through their friendly welcome in the office, and by working with my schedule for appointments. They also keep you thoroughly informed about the work being done and upfront with billing.
I have gotten a cleaning, X-ray check up, fillings done, and currently undergoing Invisalign treatment.
Thoroughly recommended!!< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Dr. Tatulyan is gentle and caring, he explains what he is doing during the whole procedure. He never recommends an unnecessary procedure. He will do whatever it takes to save a tooth. The front desk staff is friendly and accommodating to your needs.

Dr. Tatulyan and his staff are professional, friendly, caring and dental experts!  I have been a patient here since Dr. T. took over from the previous Dentist. What I like most about Dr. T is that he really cares and is very concerned about not only my dental health, but my overall comfort while in the office. Every procedure is done with patience and accuracy. His entire staff shows that they really do care about me!  His gentle hands and caring work make going to my appointments easy.  I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Tatulyan! Thank you for taking such good care of my teeth!< /Review>

My wife and I have been going to Dr. Sergey for years.  He consistently impresses us with his knowledge and technique, and his focus on delivering the highest quality care.  He's also personable and patient-centered.  Dr. Sergey is the best I've ever had at giving local anesthetic injections!  My wife is very happy with the appearance and comfort of the crowns that he's put in.  I would add that he will take the time to answer whatever questions you have.</review>

Sergey Tatulyan and his team are AMAZING! I never enjoyed that dentist and orthodontist office as a child, but I honestly LOOK FORWARD to coming here! The Doctor is very gentle. He explains everything as he works. I've never doubted that everyone has my best interest when I'm in their care. I've gotten to know everyone like family and I'm blessed to have that type of relationship with dental care.</text>

< Review>
I can say that in all my years I have never met a dentist quite like Dr. Tatulyan. I went to Dr. Sergey originally to find out more about invisalign and he made the process so simple for me. The trays that I had to wear were convenient and the best part about them was the fact that they were not noticeable to anyone. I saw a difference in my teeth even after the first trays and really loved the results after I was finished with the whole process. With the welcoming and kind nature of all the staff at this office the experience of going to the dentist is made much more enjoyable. I have come to this office for a couple years now and I can truly say that I am completely satisfied. I go to Sterling Smile for all my dental needs and can not find one bad thing about Dr. Sergey and the rest of the staff.< /Review>

I have been having my dental services handled by Dr. Tatulyan since he took over the offices from Dr. Achetel. Dr. Tatulyan is caring, experienced and highly capable in all manner of dental procedures. My wife and I have been extremely happy with all our dental needs and are pleased with how well the staff supports us during cleanings and other procedures. A 5 star staff and a 5 star dentist!!!!< /review>

I haven’t been to a dentist in a very long time other than an Orthodontist for braces.  This is because I was traumatized at a young age —neglecting the health of my teeth. I didn’t know I had cavities since my teeth seemed clean. I use a water pick and a sonicare tooth brush. When I went in, I was greeted by Kristine and Pinkie, they were both super friendly and accommodating with my situation. Dr. Tatulyan was very nice and has very gentle hands! My childhood dentist was rough and didn’t wait for the numbing gel to kick-in as opposed to Dr. T, he was very patient and didn’t rush the procedure, making it a pain-free procedure. He clearly explains to you what he is going to do and explains why. I had a deep cleaning and have had my cavities removed, all of which have experienced no pain at all during the procedure, even after the numbing gel has worn off hours after.

The facility is located at the corner of Wilbur and Roscoe Blvd and can easily be missed. Parking is located in the back of the building. It shares the parking space with another clinic located inside the building.

Overall, I would highly recommend anyone who is afraid to go to the dentist or is very sensitive to pain to go to Sterling Smiles, you won’t regret it!

Cheers! :)</Text>

Sergey Tatulyan DDS is a wonderful dentist.  I live approximately 27 miles from Dr. Sergey's office, and could find a dentist in closer proximity to my home, but I believe the quality of care is important, and I am willing to make the drive to get my dental care from Dr. Sergey.  He always takes the time to explain each procedure, which is important to me.  His office staff is also wonderful...Pinky, Rachelle, Kristine...!!!  Thank you Dr. Sergey!!!<//text>

Not only is Dr. Tatulyan a very good professional, but is also very intelligent and I always enjoy speaking to him about a variety of subjects, which makes the overall experience a very pleasant one. He is very patient wtih everyone and kind to his staff. My husband's teeth were in horrible condition a few years ago. He has a perfect smile now thanks to Dr. Tatulyan! Give him a visit and you will not regret it.</Text>

I’ve been going to Dr Tatulyan’s dental office in Northridge, CA since 2012 and by far he’s been the best dentist I’ve ever been to and I can confidently say that I will never look for another dentist ever again. He explains all my dental treatment in detail and always made it sure that I am well informed. His staff are always helpful, kind and caring and makes me feel like I’m family in their office. One of the things that I Iove about him and his staff is  that they always make sure to pre-approve my treatment needed to be done to my insurance before starting any dental procedure. I will highly recommend him because he is an excellent dentist that takes pride in everything that he does.</Review>

CCV is an amazing community and a place that I call home! Not only has this church brought me to Christ when I was baptized in 2010 but my husband as well who was just baptized last year in 2018! My kids both love going!  My youngest son is 4 and is special needs and the church provides him with a 1 on 1 buddy so that he can participate in all the Kids Activities while my husband and I enjoy the main service.<//Text>

<Text>❤️ This became our home church after the first time we attended. We had been attending a previous church for 14 years, and the first time we went to CCV the people were so welcoming and made us feel like we belonged. It has now been 2 1/2 years for our family attending this beautiful church where we are able to connect with Jesus and be involved with our community service locally as well as abroad. Loving God and loving others is what we get to do daily through CCV.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Rating>5</Rating><UserId.>110782991793571772132< /UserId.>< Response>

< Review>
I went to this church in Arizona for 10 years in my youth and teenage years before I left Christianity. It was just the message of the cross and how to be happy. I never heard repentance mentioned once in those 10 years. I was led to believe I could sin as much as I want because I did the sinners prayer. The questions i had the pastors couldn't answer and I ended up leaving Christianity when I was 18 in a search for answers to my questions. CCV will lead you and your children to hell. About 80% of my youth group no longer are Christian today. Fun and Games doesnt prepare you for life and leaves you with a faith paper thin.</Review>

<Review>After going to a church for over 30 years, my husband and I decided to try out CCV. Within 30 minutes of being there, we both felt that this was home. The love and grace that radiated from the people told us that the Spirit was active amongst this body of believers. Christ is at the center of the congregation at CCV. A place where all are welcomed and loved, and where biblical truth is taught in that very love. The Spirit of God is on the move at CCV and I feel incredibly blessed that God brought us here. The greatest Spiritual growth that my husband and I have had has been while we've attended CCV the past 4 years. My daughters and my son have all found their best friends at CCV, and frankly, so have my husband and myself. Doing life together in a community of loving believers is a gift from God, and CCV has mastered that gift. You belong here!< /Review>< UserId.>

We could have not found a better more fulfilling place to hear God's word through Bible based ministry. Our pastors are all awesome! Our volunteers are many and delighted to help all in the glory of God. We are the most welcoming, accepting church of all people no matter what your background or baggage may be. This Easter the Etiwanda campus will be celebrating Christ's resurrection at several Easter services. I encourage all to consider attending and pray for God to bring you to CCV. May you be all blessed.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>My new favorite spot! The drinks are inventive, tasty, and strong. The menu is great for bar bites and larger plates. We had the lumpia with yummy pickles and fries with fried parsley, and I'd love to try the other offerings, especially the ramen. Service was super prompt and friendly. Great music, decor, and amazing bathroom.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3aOrZ-zaK14iaQ4ttugY40YmsmwgypCrsN3Mq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_xzbB9RHueRr1Twt0bOttd_WKataFcjr5ChU-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6fSw3aDpp8UOUwzjQB3LjaECesdkakiaJY5IN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

The Bartenders know what they are doing. All the drinks seem well thought out and delicious. Fun atmosphere with a hip staff. Whenever I’m up north, I always got a stop in for some refreshments.<//Review>

Upscale bar on the main drag of Gyservile.
Great for fantastic food, fun cocktails, or a shot and a beer.
Large tv is perfect for watching sports.
Eclectic art and bathroom decor< /text>

Great bar in wine country located at the intersection of Geyserville. Don't blink or you'll pass it by. After a day of wine adventure it's time for a cold beer or a cocktail. This is your place to grab a quick bite too. Simply fantastic. Surrounded by cool little tasting rooms and a couple of restaurants. Fun!<//text>

In my drinking days, this was my go to spot. Place has a great ambiance and they always have some sweet movie playing in the back. Why do I keep coming back when I don't drink? FOOD. The quality of food that comes out of this kitchen is to die for. Do yourself a favor. Make the trip. They also make fantastic mocktails!!</Text>

Passed this place a few times and finally decided to stop in. They had a fun cocktail list. They were out of something in what I ordered & the bar tender whipped me up some mezcal Margarita type thing with ancho reyes. Sounded weird but was delicious. She really knew her stuff. Bar back was very nice & helpful as we were from out of town. Would definitely stop again & recommend.</Text>

The Bomb...
Ultra cool space, clean innovative menu made for the cocktail crowd, drinks are delish and the staff smart and friendly!
Go for the Griffo Chardonnay Barreled Gin on the rocks with a twist!</review>

<text>Can a pub get 10 stars? Can anything get 10 Stars? We visited this place while roaming around wine country. First off it's a Cheers type bar with a loyal local clientele as well as tourists. They specialize in handcrafted drinks with hard to find spirits. There is an eclectic menu that changes almost daily and good for quick bites. Diavalo's Pizza next door is owned by the same chef and we ordered gnocchi from their menu and ate at the gun club bar. I've eaten hundreds of gnocchi dishes and this was by far and away the most unusual, and almost risky recipe, so much so that I just had to try it. It was the bomb!    I wanted to live in Geyserville just so I could hang out and eat there. If you are in the area and tired of high-priced meals, this is just the place to eat well, at a moderate price.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Over priced for self service dining tables & nudging up to the bar to place your order and chasing down a fork! Beware of their "medium" made to order burger more like rare.</Review>< pics>

A good bar with good service to get us our drinks but they failed to deliver our fries we had ordered. Good crowd. I would go back for drinks.< /Text>

<text>A great cocktail bar! Unique drinks with some great spins on classic cocktails to change things up. Service was fast, helpful and friendly. The food was great as well! We had their curry fries and calamari fritti. They were both delicious and the portion size was perfect. This place is a must for anyone visiting Geyserville!</text>< Pics>

Great ambiance, fun cocktails, good food, and the bartenders will mix up something creative off menu if you like. Yes it's the one bar in town, but it would stand up favorably to most SF bars - except here you don't have to deal with the crowds.< /review>

Today is my first time I went to this store but i saw their prices are way higher  and cashier is so rude  , i guess Tall skinny dark skin less hair in his head he was the cashier may be he is owner but he was so rude guy i have ever seen ,  His customer service is so bad ,  I will never ever go to this store again , if they don’t know how to speak nicely then we will not give this store the business... i requested to Innocent customers plz if u feel  this store owner or cashier is so rude then plz do not give them a business.  We no need this store actually this store need us , If they are rude with customers then no more business with them .  K from sacramento</text>

It's definitely a store where you get what you pay for sort of thing. Produce is cheap, but most is poor quality. Overall go and check it out it's an interesting store and adds variety to what you can buy around the area. Watch out for mold in several of the items you are buying.< /text>

I went to get some “gur” (sugar cane) from this shop and the owner wouldn’t get off his iPhone. I finally found “gur” and I ask him for a bag. He said in Punjabi “tenu pata nai mein phone teh a” (Can’t you see I’m on the phone?)
Very rude to customers</Text>

Lentils (dal) are thought to be a stable (legume) in India!

So I thought...

I went in to the store so confidently to purchase a bag of lentil. It was supposed to be a quick in-n-out event. But, what occurred next took me by surprise:

First, I could not find lentils, up and down. So.I decided to inquire with the shop owner. Giving me a perlexed look, he said he had no ideas as to what lentil is. Still Perplexed. So, I googled the image of lentil and showed him. He confirmed, again, that he does not know.what it is. OMG, now, I was speechless...

I left the shop thinking I need to watch the film, "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" (1982), tonight, for a good hearty laugh...

And, no one should assume by apperance that a Chinese-American would surely know.what fried rice and potstickers are..The truisim.would.also.apply to Indian-American culture.

What I should have done beforehand was call, first, to verify the shop carries the lentils...< /Text>

Friendly, open-air market atmosphere. Fair prices. Huge variety of Indian foods. Deli with pastries, sweets, and entrees reasonably priced. Samples here and there give a chance to see what foods are like before purchasing.</Text>

Today was my first visit to Day Camp Coffee. It was a cold, wet and rainy March day in Chico (3.10.21). A good friend of mine suggested we check it out and I'm glad we did. The ambiance was really nice. The decor and interior aesthetics were very clean and contemporary. They offer a nice selection of drip coffee a variety of teas and a variety of other beverages. The young man behind the counter was cool and courteous. The drip coffee I purchased was delightful. We lounged on the very cool and comfortable leather couch upstairs. I will be back soon.<//text>

One of the Best Coffee shops in Chico, and we have alot! I have tried every one i have heard of in town now, with Daycamp being the last on the list for now.

Lets start with the brass tax, the coffee and pastries are phenomenal! I got their Guatemalan blend drip with a savory bun. Coffee notes are complex and my savory pastry is to die for. Atmosphere is very modern with everything just right, from the long spoons that are never too short even for my 16 ounce thermos to the expansive open room that really lets your mind wander.

You will definitely find me here more often!<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>I have moved and was is town for one day. The main thing I was going to pick up, while in Chico, was about 4 bags of coffee. I probably would have purchased drinks too. Anyway, I walk up to the place in 100°+ weather and was refused service. It’s turned into a Covidiocracy! She didn’t say I’ll come to you and take your order, it was a NO. She wasn’t polite at all. Try turning your TV off and grow a backbone. You don’t even serve things inside! Rationale straight out of the window. Most the people outside were maskless (which is awesome, since this is a psychological war). People that push TV propaganda are low.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

I’m friends with the owners so my review will be a bit biased... but friendships aside, Daycamp is awesome. Last time I was there the weather was nice enough to have the roll up door open, which added a whole new level to the pleasantly spacious and well designed interior. Now, friendship NOT aside, Kyle and Mark have always been known for their extreme passion for high quality coffee, and when you visit Daycamp, that passion is obvious. If you already appreciate great coffee, or you’d like to see what perfectly roasted and brewed coffee tastes like, then stop in and pay these guys a visit.</text>

Blended coffee drinks taste stale. Employees also not real big into revealing who they are getting their beans from. I'll come back in 6 months to see how they evolve.<//Review>

I loved the atmosphere day camp provides! They always let me bring in my Klean kanteen to use as a cup instead of the disposable ones! I would recommend this cafe to anyone looking for a great atmosphere and sustainability fans!<//text>

<user_id>108479451076475821335<//user_id><Text>Daycamp is a true recollection of a back country day camp: Hot coffee, friendly people, epic atmosphere. The Barista's at Day camp are talented to say the least. They are excellent at making my favorite espresso drinks, a Flat White, Cortado, Macchiato or a shot. They even roast there own beans! Overall I'd say that the quality of their beans are about a 8/10 and their espresso drink skills are about a 9/10. Looks like I found myself another great Chico coffee shop!</Text></record></dataset><record>

My puppy dog got a very handsome hair cut and he seemed to not to be too scared. This was his first time and I feel the Clean Cut personal kept him very comfortable. I will definitely use them again.< /Review>

<Review>Moe was so kind and gentle! Came to our house and washed all three of our dogs and groomed two! Can't say how much they needed it! He was prompt, spoke softly and was so so gentle with my small elderly nippy dog! Can't recommend him enough! Thank you Moe! Hope to see you again.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

My puppy was styled in a timely fashion, thank you Clean Cut Grooming! This animal grooming company is professional and has over 5 years of experience. They reassured me that the products used were with grade A ingredients that will help reduce skin reactions. They also offer moblie grooming options and will come straight to your front door. I will definitely try the mobile service next time. I still can't believe how cute, cuddly and scratch free my puppy is now!< /text>

These guys come to our home and deliver excellent service. They groom my dog regularly, and I don't have to drive to them in the heavy traffic. Very convenient. The grooming is professional and of the highest standards. You and your pet will be happy after the session. This grooming is important not just for beauty; it's also for the hygiene and health of your pet. We are lucky to have this service.</Text>

Clean cut grooming has amazing services with an affordable price. I took my baby Bruno there to have his fur unmatted and cut. Not only are they professional when it comes to dealing with you and your dog but they do such an amazing job. My baby looked so beautiful and clean when we left. Thanks so much guys!!!<//Review>

<Review>I took my kitty there for a bath and nail trimming because he gets fussy. They were amazing and showed me how to do it myself without getting hurt. We finished in an hour. I even got a cute green bow tie for him. I felt confident and trusted what they were doing. I'm glad I took him they're. I purchased some electronic pet dispenser products and got a discount for being a first time customer. I highly recommend clean cut grooming it was a great experience and I actually had fun.< /Review>< pictures>

Ya'll let me tell you how amazing this company is. As soon as i called I was greeted by a friendly woman (whose name escapes me at the moment) who helped me make an appointment to fit my schedule. I love my dog but as he is larger ( a saint Bernard) it is not easy to get him in the car and take him to the groomers. Clean cut groomers offers Mobile grooming with a wide variety of services. I paid for the full service bath, which was really affordable. Especially considering the convenience and the amazing job they did with my big baby. Thank you a million.</Review>

I used this family owned business for first time and I'm so pleased with level of service. They did such a great job on my boy. I'll use this grooming store again and I would recommend them.<//Review>

At Clean Cut Grooming I found excellent customer service and also expert grooming services for my skittish boy cat Saffron.  He is rather heavy and hates to be bathed and as such is too difficult for me to bathe alone.  He also needed his fur trimmed and claws clipped, and Clean Cut Grooming handled it all!  They treated my boy cat very gently and he really didn't get that upset about his bath.  They trimmed his fur real cute and he came out clean smelling and very handsome!  The price was great, very fair and the best price I'd been able to find calling around.  I really can't say enough good things about this full-service grooming facility.  Give them a try... I am sure you'll be as pleased as I am!<//Review>

Clean and calm van, fast and friendly service, Knowledgeable groomer. Needed to find a groomer for my dog. I was hesitant about trying a new one. After taking  to Moe(the mobile Groomer), I have to say that she came out looking good and cleaner than ever! Couldn't be happier with the service and fair prices.< /text>

I were really nervous about taking my babies - Yorkie to a new groomer. When we arrived I was impressed ,

When I picked him up, he looked absolutely fabulous!

I've finally found a groomer that I am totally comfortable with leaving my babies and knowing they're, literally, in great hands!</Review>

I've tried numerous groomers in the area, and nobody can seem to get my mini poodle's hair quite the way I like it. We don't give her a typical poodle cut, so most other groomers get kind of confused and end up just doing whatever. I got a recommendation for Clean Cut Mobile Pet Grooming from someone I met at a dog park. Her cockapoo looked so precious, so I looked them up on line and gave them a call.

I had never used a mobile grooming service, but the convenience really cannot be beat. They arrived when they said they would and everything from scheduling and noting what I wanted was extremely professional. Best of all, they really listened to me and my dog looked just the way I wanted her to.

The groomer was so nice and obviously very skilled. Not a single uneven spot or any complaints. we will definitely be scheduling another appointment very soon.<//review>

<Review>So my rescue cocker spaniel Kirby is a seasoned escape artist, and he's not trusting of strangers. Groomers in the past have found it difficult and stressful to tame his ferociousness let alone his fur.
This is why he looked like a lion for so long poor baby. It's getting hot so I had no choice I had to
Trim his fur.

. I wasn't expecting much other than them coming to me.  it's just my dog, he's an angel but he's nuts and determined to remain stinky!

But somehow his doggie -A.D.D wasn't an issue.He was trusting and submissive with the groomer who was very friendly and knowledgeable in breed specialty cuts.

They brushed his teeth and out little bows on his ears, they cleaned his ears very well. Anyone with a spaniel knows how much maintenance those floppy ears can be.

I highly recommend these guys if they could
Groom my pretty- much -Farrel- spaniel, quickly, come to me, and at a competitive price?? Yeah I'm
Breaking up with the old groomer.

And my car won't smell like wet dog from the ride home anymore!!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<Review>Took our dog for first time here after getting a groupon discount and we are not satisfied at all. When we got home we noticed this cut on his back leg covered with skin glue. We called and we are told he had a curling nail into his back lateral  paw and in the process of cutting it got a little cut open. He apologized  for not letting us know when we picked him up. Today 2 days after, our dog licked  the skin glue out and we can see the cut clearly  and it is not close at all to the nail. To us it seems the cut happened to the back of paw while cutting his fur.< /Review>< pictures>

I went in for a quote on august 5th, everything went incredibly smooth and I was able to find a quote that matched my budget , incredibly professional and helpful. Definitely will recommend to all my friends and acquaintances. I believe the representative that guided me through the process is named Cassandra. Sadly I can only rate 5 stars but I’d rate it higher if I was able too!! Amazing company.<//text>

I called and set up an appointment for insurance and when I got there, I was shown to Kate’s desk right away! I don’t know too much about insurance so it was nice that she broke down the different types of coverage and made recommendations of what type of insurance I needed for my car. I thought this would be such a long process and I was in and out of the store in like 45 minutes. It’s nice knowing I can actually come into an office and see a REAL person when I need it. Kate did an awesome job and I’ll make sure to come back to her for any changes in the future!!< /review>

Today I was so surprised with my visit to the Cost-U-Less Insurence.. The nicest and most helpful young lady named Clairee Goins waited on me and made my experience so simple. She explained everything so I could understand it and found me a plan that suited for me. She was such a breath of fresh air. I would recommend this office just because of her. Thank you Clairee<//text>

Do not trust these people!! I called in to put full coverage insurance on my brand new car and basic liability insurance on my used 2000. Queren who did my policy put the wrong coverage on my car and did it the other way around full coverage on my used car and basic on my new one. Never once mentioned it even when I asked her what my coverage was went in a second time and asked about my coverage once again not mentioned! Fast forward to today and I got into an accident and they’re saying I never had full coverage on my new car. I do realize that the consumer is responsible for signing the contracts and asking questions and it is simply the brokers job to help and answer the questions. But what do I do now after I asked these questions and I trusted these people to insure my vehicles the way I asked them to and they don’t care enough to do their job correctly or even look at a computer screen long enough to answer my questions correctly. Everyone there is incompetent! Right down to the corporate office who calls me everyday other day to harass me to tell me it’s not their fault mind you I have only called them once and have not called since then. Do not trust this company!!!< /Review>

<userid>111810284541581032878<//userid><text>Had the most wonderful experience today, had a million errands to run one being insurance.  I walked into Cost U Less and was approached by the most engaging and professional young lady by the name of Claire Goins. She was very attentive and really understood what my insurance needs and budget was. I walked out with a great policy and price that I was happy with. I recommend her to anyone looking for great insurance and even greater customer service.

Thanks Claire Goins,

Had a very quick and painless start up of insurance at Cost-U-Less on Pacific, and I must say Clairee was to thank for that. She was very knowledgeable, cheerful, and and made me feel good about my choice of insurance. I would reccomend them to anyone, and if you want to be treated right, ask for Clairee.</review>

<text>What an experience!!! I am a USC graduate student and I commute on a regular. I have had AAA and GEICO before in the past I can FOR SURE say that COST-U-LESS out beats them in customer service. Immediately I was helped, in a timely manner, with adding another car on my insurance at a crazy reasonable rate; LIKE CRAZY!!! Especially for having a "speedy" record. David Lagenour, I am humbled to have had you help me with the process, and you are such a down to earth individual. I might just want to add another car just to have another helping of a great car insurance experience.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

1st: The first car I initially started a policy on had its registration suspended because whoever entered the vin initially was off by one number. I had to pay $14 to have the registration reinstated. I called them about it when I received the first notice and was assured everything would be taken care of (It obviously wasnt.) It wasnt until my registration was suspended that their staff caught the error.

2nd: I recently purchased a new vehicle and ended up starting a new policy. Initially I was quoted a price that I was ok with so I drove over 100 miles to pick up the vehicle. When I called back to purchase the insurance, the down payment amount changed. The agent at that time was able to figure it out but through all the confusion, forgot to add my SR-22 to the policy. I have to have an SR-22 or my license will be suspended. I tried to take care of it over the phone on 10/20/17 but was told I have to go to the office to complete the process. I went early Saturday morning (delaying my plans) and was told that I was given incorrect information and did not need to go to the office, rather, just call the new insurance carrier. To add injury to insult, today I received a letter from DMV stating my license is now suspended (it was dated 10/20/17). I have to pay $55 to have it reinstated. So due to the negligence of Cost-U-Less, not once but two times, I have had to spend $69 in DMV fees and approximately 3 hours of my personal time to right their obvious mistakes. You can look over my account and confirm everything I'm stating is exactly what happened. I requested comments be placed on my account summarizing the conversations each time I called. Bottom line, what is the proposed remedy here?< /text><time>1509085410952<//time></record></dataset><record>

Took my truck there so they can install 4 new tires That I bought. I ask one of the employees how much to install all four tires he said 100 I said ok it took them 25 min so I paid them as soon I got into the freeway my truck started to  bounce so I took it back to them and they charged  me 15 dollars more I paid again so they balance the  tires again so left again I got into freeway with in a 1/2 mile it started to bounce again I never took it back to Gaby ‘s tire shop.   I got it fix in lemon grove at Evans tires</Text>

Had a flat and they were the closest to my house. Blown away by how fast and no nonsense the place was. Got right to it, plugged my tire. Didn't even try to sell me a used one. They just said to come back when I'm ready to get all 4 replaced.<//Review>

Had a flat that needed a repair. After two shops telling me they couldn't fix it, I went in search for a used tire to get me by. Gaby's shop and crew saw me right away and was able to match and replace my tire for an awesome price. Thanks for all your help. Highly recommend!</Text>

Be careful if your instincts are not up to par I wouldn't recommend this place. However on the other side of the nickle service is fast they do a good job their service rates are almost what the competitions are sometimes it veries. I personally frown coming to this place unless I got a blow out near there. It's kind of grimmy  it can be accident prone from all the pnematic air tools & long hoses, tools, tires ,rims, floor-Jack's, etc laying around. So if you must go just be extra cautious, be sober 💯% watch your step.<//review>

Very fast (& friendly) service. I was driving on my spare and that's all I needed to tell them when I drove on to their lot. They had me back safely on the road with a spare where it belongs(in the trunk).😁< /review>

Great employees fast and they don't give you the run around trying to up sell you. Any questions on the quality they show you black and white. I bought new tires for two different cars and still could not have found better place for the price or quality work.</Review>

<Text>Straight forward no fuss tire shop.  My family and I have been coming here for years.  Used tires for my compact car are only  $35 and I have to have an issue.  Today I came in because the low tire pressure light kept coming on eventhough I checked all 4 tires twice.  They found which was leaking air but solved the problem without trying to sell me something I didn't need.</Text>< pictures>

<text>I had a blowout and put on my donut type spare on my car and threw the flat tire/wheel in my trunk. Later that morning I got a used tire from a friend. I went to this establishment with the used tire to get the used tire installed onto the rim then have them mount the wheel onto my car. They removed my spare donut tire and placed it into my trunk. Then they removed my blown tire carcass and put it into my trunk on top off the spare. Then they grabbed the tire I got from my buddy and installed the used tire onto my rim and lastly they balanced the wheel, THEY DID IT ALL FOR ONLY $!0!! And it took only 10 minutes.

(Translated by Google) I went to have a tire repaired and they helped me with rapids and excellent work. It is my preference when I occupy tire service. I recommend them to all those who are looking for good quality tires and at a reasonable price. When you occupy service you see Gaby's Tires.

I am absolutely astonished at how awesome parcel pending is! Their customer service is so amazing! We were dreading having to call in because our Amazon delivery driver ended up placing our packages in a different locker than the locker that we got a code to. We contacted our apartment complex and Amazon, and they were totally useless. So we contacted parcel pending, and not only was our customer service representative Melanie S so kind, but she was extremely helpful, dedicated, and hardworking. She saw us from start to finish, and was able to help us retrieve our packages, which I never even thought would be possible! I highly recommend signing up this service if your complex/community offers it. It is a safe way to receive your orders, and they are a caring, professional company.< /text>

<username>Garrett Villarreal< /username><review>I’ve been receiving texts lately saying my account needed to be updated. I would go on my account and everything was already updated. I felt like I was running in circles trying to figure out what was going with my account. I finally got a number and spoke with Wesley Zoroya. Apparently I had two charges on my account due to not picking up packages within the deadline.(I had no idea this what a thing). Anyways, Wesley was very friendly and polite, he waved my two small charges and helped me get my account updated correctly. I’m simply writing this to let anyone know that Wesley is a great employee and definitely has his head on right. I always like to acknowledge great customer service whenever I receive it .</review><Date>1619635489789</Date><gmap_id>0x80dce9a99fc89803:0x19e29dc8eaffd1f9< /gmap_id>< Resp>

I’m so impressed with Mic.  I had minimal information and he looked in so many areas as to where my package was located. He indicated that to please enter the code and that the item was in a large box.  He actually made my day with him being professional as well as considerate  and calming to my every need.  I’m usually a “trucker month and loud” but even the way he answered the phone I felt he’s the one that I can be calm with. EXCELLENCE.  He should be considered as a designated trainer and what and how the job is done.  Thank you so much for Mic.</Text>

Kari is outstanding at what she does. She went way beyond in helping me locate a lost package. She is a great asset to your company and should be training all your people. She was very cheerful yet concerned committed and focused. She kept me calm and skillfully guided me through the process and located my package
Thank you Kari</Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>Kari did a fantastic job, and she was very helpful and I appreciate it. I just think that the service should be able to handle larger packages or someone should inform the tenant if they have a large package that parcel pending can’t deliver. This is America and people buy large items such as TVs or furniture and you should be able to handle that as well. To not even consider it, but to have so many spaces for smaller boxes is a bit silly. In the future you should be able to accommodate all packages, if this is a service that is customer oriented.</review>< Pics>

We recently had the package lockers from this company installed at my property.  It's a cool idea and convenient when it actually works.  The lockers seem to lose their connection to the internet quite frequently or the door for your package just doesn't open like it should.   I've had to call customer service multiple times and their phone menu says they are experiencing "higher than normal" call volume every single time.  If you are a property manager considering this for your property, you should look at other options and ask tough questions.  My experience has not been convenient, it has been frustrating.<//text>

This company cares about their customers!

had been looking for my package that UPS said was delivered to my address about a week ago. I can't stress enough how hard I was working to find this VERY important package. I was able to connect with their customer service line in about 5 minutes  today and they stayed on the phone with me until we were both able to track it down. The employee went out of her way and used everything she had available to her to help me. I couldn't be happier with the way this company handled things.</review>

I’ve spoken to two people at Parcel Pickup this week (it’s the holidays; things get lost).  Dee Dee was exceptional in her knowledge, thoroughness, and follow up.  I appreciate her empathy and work to ensure my package was found.</Review>

I cannot rave enough about how helpful Stephanie was in helping me find my package today! When it was delivered, I didn't receive a code but only had a picture from the shipping provider - and with that alone she was able to track down which locker it was in and open it remotely so that I didn't have to wait two days for my leasing office to be open again to help! On top of everything, she was the kindest person to talk to.  So glad this service exists and that they hire great people.<//Text>

Michelle T. was very helpful, patient, and understanding when I called looking for help. I experienced some difficulty retrieving a package that was delivered incorrectly by USPS and she was very resourceful in trying to pin down the location of my package. She was extremely respectful and showed true empathy. I greatly appreciate the effort she put in to help me. I know it’s not easy dealing with frustrated  callers, but she was honestly so gracious. Thank you for your help and kindness, Michelle.< /review>

Nicole Krochmalny was literally the BEST customer service representative I have ever had out of any service I have used! She actively listened to my concerns and was able to provide fast and effective service. I do not know what position she holds in the company, but I DO believe that she should be paid to teach her excellent customer service the rest of the company!<//Text>

<Review>My apartment complex uses parcel pending for package deliveries.  A few months ago, I had several packages delivered to me but did not receive a notification for one of them.  I picked up all but one package due to the confusing way their notifications are sent.  Due to that, they charged me a late fee (which they waived on the account) but we're forcing me to add a credit card into their system.  I do not add my credit card information randomly into websites, however when I called parcel pending a few months back I spoke with quite possibly the rudest customer service agent ever.  He deactivated my account, however recently I have found that parcel pending is still accepting packages for my apartment number, and then holding the packages hostage (no notification, my apartment complex can't help because they state that parcel pending controls at all, etc).  Ultimately, due to this horrible experience, and the absolutely horrible call that I had with their customer service agent, I would not recommend this company at all.  Super frustrated with getting packages delivered to me because they keep intercepting them.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Tracking said my package was delivered, but there was no sign of it and I didn't get a code. I called Parcel Pendung for assistance, and the customer rep Mic was SO HELPFUL. He went above and beyond to help me. It d=turns out the delivery person did not scan my package, but Mic went through the unassigned packages until he was able to find mine. I truly appreciate such great customer service.</text>

This company is a joke. Amazon delivered a package in the locker even though I have specific instructions not to.

I call customer service and they tell me that since I am not a registered member they can’t do anything about it. They have effectively stolen my delivery and will not help get it back. The agent I spoke with said “we take care of our members” and hung up on me.

I will be filing a compliant with the BBB.<//Review>

Parcel Pending is the BEST invention ever!!! Hearing that locker “POP” open with my secure package inside is THE GIFT that KEEPS ON GIVING!!! So thankful my apartment community has this service! So convenient because I can get my package at any time!!! I have never had an issue with the lockers or keypad system either!!! #LOVEParcelPending #ApartmentMustHave #HappyResident<//Review>

I had the pleasure of dealing with Kari Fjugstad today ultimately resulting in finding my wayward package.  She was very professional and acted as if the delivery of my package was important to her as well.  I recently retired after 42 years in Sales & Marketing management and I understand the challenges faced when providing telephone support.  I give Kari highest marks.  Thank you.  Sincerely, Bernie Drury< /Text>

My package was showing as delivered on fedex system but I didn’t get any notification from pending parcel. I think there is a error in system as I noticed there is no space between my first and last name from shipper, so parcel pending couldn’t send me a notification.

I call parcel pending at least thrice to scan items based on my apartment unit but all three representatives found nothing but on my forth attempt, Kari lifted my phone and was able to scan and track my lost packages. She was so kind and able to help me beyond my expectations. I would really like to give her 5 star and would appreciate all her help yesterday to retrieve my packages.</text>

I spoke with Michelle Torres, and she saved my day! I had a package delivered to my apartment complex via FedEx today, but the package was placed in a Parcel Pending box (even though an account was never created for me to receive mail that way). Michelle was able to promptly locate my package and provide assistance with accessing it. She was kind and extremely patient. One of the BEST customer service experiences I've ever had.

Thank you,

-Jasmine< /Review>

We’ve been happy with the service so far, it’s always “just worked” and has been a nice amenity to have access too. We recently had a package go missing due to a UPS error with both UPS and the vendor being of minimal help in resolving the situation. However, within an hour of calling parcel pending and speaking with Michelle Torres our package had been located and everything was resolved. She was extremely sympathetic and thorough in helping us out!</Review>

Unlike some that have written bad reviews about Parcel Pending, I have only great things to say. Their customer service is incredible. I had a serious issue last night, 10/22/20, around 10.30pm. The locker was empty and no item could be found. The customer service representative,  Patricia Lubera, was unbelievable. She stayed on the phone for almost 30 minutes. Then called me back to ensure that everything went well. 5 stars are not enough. Thank you Patricia.

<Text>I was getting messages sent in error regarding my packages, and was notified that I'd be getting charged daily for packages that I had already picked up. Even though their email customer service was a bit slow (kind of frustrating) their customer service help line team is incredibly helpful, very patient, and resolved all of my issues. Cheri even called to follow up and let me know that all the issues had been fixed, which is a wonderful person touch that I greatly appreciated.< /Text><Date>1595006720163</Date></record>

<Review>Andrew M. helped me find my package and also helped me understand the hang-up that caused me to not get an alert at the time of delivery.

5 stars for delivering a super easy solution and clear, reasonable explanation. 5 more for having an upbeat attitude. Must be hard dealing with lost packages on a normal day. Add in world conditions being what they are? Tough gig!

Bravo. Thanks!</Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Parcel Pending is an amazing service and I highly recommend investing to anyone on the fence. It is money well spent.  I don't normally leave reviews but I am leaving this specific review about the OUTSTANDING customer relations specialist Melanie Satterfield I had the absolute pleasure of speaking with. She was kind, professional, knowledgeable, and went above and beyond to help me troubleshoot and problem solve through my question. She is what I think of when I think of excellent customer service....I hope her manager/Parcel Pending Management sees this review...she's a keeper and deserves praise!!!<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I couldn't be happier with the service at this company. Ive lived in communities with this system for several years now and only Once have i ever had an issue with the system itself. This week i reached out for some assistance with the locker system, and learned that there are some tech issues right now which the team is building an new update patch to resolve. Andrew Montecino Emailed me shortly after i submitted the ticket to assist me and help me better understand the steps that were being taken to address the issue over all. After an extra day being able to get into the locker he assured me that the fee tracking system was disabled since the system is hard to access right now AND he called me personally to see if i was able to stop by the locker before the end of his day to try to remote unlock the lockers my shipments were in. He has been so kind and very patient, taking the time to follow up with me as well as offer additional solutions when the first step took a hair longer than anticipated. What an excellent service team they have here to support the user base.

For the company itself i think its a fantastic idea, it is so much easier to get my shipments securely with this system in the community!

Thank you!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I want to take the time to say thank you to Susan Miller who could not have been anymore helpful. During these tough times I imagine that many people are having things delivered and with increased deliveries comes a few issues. She was extremely patient and diligent in her search for my package. I am happy to say that we were able to locate it and even if we had not I know that she did the best she could. Thanks so much Susan!<//review>

<Review>This company has lost 6 packages in the span of 4 months. This company will blame the carrier (ups, usps, fedex). But they have a system where packages go into a room where everyone in the apartment complex can go into. PACKAGES CAN EASILY BE STOLEN BY PEOPLE OF THE APARTMENT COMPLEX OR CARRIERS. The company has no reliability system. WE PAY FOR THIS SYSYTEM.  Yet we get literally NOTHING IN RETURN. Plus, they charge you $5 a day if you do not pick up your package within 2 days. WORST EXPERIENCE.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I just wanted to share how much I appreciate Parcel Post.  They are a comple blessing.  No more lost packages.  Amazon delivered my package.  They put it in locker without scanning it, and Amazon basically told me go fly a kite. And Parcel Pending found it.

But I just want to say that I’m 54, and today I met the most caring and diligent and zealous customer service representative.  Nicole Krochmalny.  Got information about the package, drop off time, carrier.  She called and texted me, and did not stop intil she found my package.  Parcel Post is lucky to have an employee like her that cares.  Nicole thanks so much.  You made my day.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>I had an excellent experience with Parcel Pending as Kari Fjugstad is one of its employees. My very important document was missing and Kari went above and beyond her day-to-day responsibility to help me find the package. She listened patiently and greatly understood my concern. Kari demonstrated her outstanding customer service skills. Kari is a tremendous asset to any company that she works for.</text>< pictures>

Between my apartment saying they don't have them, Amazon and others saying they were delivered or cannot put them in my parcel pending locker I was getting extremely frustrated with the experience. I finally got to speak with Aaliyah G. From parcel pending she was able to help me within 5min. Got me squared away and I was able to retrieve 3 packages that have been in the lockers for 1 month.< /Text>< pics>

I recently had an Amazon package misplaced by the delivery driver. I spoke with Michelle Torres and she was amazing!!
Not only was she able to find my package, but she was able to contact the resident who's box the package was in and arrange a neutral place were I could pick it up.
Michelle really went above and beyond to help me out and I really appreciate her kindness and consideration.
If there were ever an example of excellent customer service Michelle Torres would be the epitome.<//text>

I called the customer service for get my package today. I never bought the service from them, but Fedex send my package by mistake to the locker. When I call them, one of a female customer service representative told me they are not able to help... And then hang up my phone???? Why she’s so rude to me???? This is my worst experience for talking to the customer service representative ever... I hate her!< /review>

Turned out that we each got recharged the initial fee of $20. After talking with my building I decided to call and request a refund. I want through and found my original invoice # and the most recent one to be prepared but once I got on the phone with Michelle Torres I had no need for all that info. In fact Michelle was able to pull no only my double charge but also my husbands. Thank you Michelle for your quick, friendly and extremely helpful assistance in getting our refund.

That is what I call great customer service. ;)</review>< Pics>

I had an unassigned item in a locker and Michelle Torres quickly helped me find the item. Using a picture from Amazon of the unassigned item sitting in its locker, Michelle helped me open the correct locker which contained my item. In just about 10 minutes I was able to get my missing item very easily. Best experience with parcel pending so far, thank you.<//text>

Had a jammed locker situation and Mic was great helping to resolve the problem.  Kinda fun kicking the affected locker to shake it loose so I could re-enter the code and retrieve it.  Very unusual resolution but it worked!!<//Text>

Danielle DeFazio has been the absolute most helpful company rep i have worked with in a LONG time! As we are switching over 300+ residents to parcel pending lockers i have gotten mounds of questions from residents and she has answered every single one, sent over updates on who all has registered, sent out reminder emails for us, the whole works! I  highly recommend parcel pending as a stress free package system but even more for their costumer service!</Text>

<text>Called in for help on a missing package and talked to someone who not only helped me figure it out but was seriously so fun, happy, and a pleasure to speak with. I won’t care if another package goes missing so long as I can talk to Sydney! This was the easiest process possible with such a helpful woman!</text>< gmap_id>

<Review>I had to call to get assistance with two packages that were left supposedly in the Parcel Pending locker room, but I didn't receive a PP notification, just a photo from Amazon of the packages sitting on a floor.  She tried helping me out with the tracking information I had and verified there were only four packages delivered about 40m after the amazon tracking posted the picture and tracking of the delivery.  The PP rep was very helpful.  I've been very pleased with this service our apartment complex has adopted, just very disappointed that their are people out there that are stealing packages that aren't theirs.  Boo on the amazon delivery guy and the person that took the packages.  Yay for PP, you guys are the best.< /Review><name>Heidi Welchlin< /name><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< rate>

Tonight after having one the worst moving experiences during an extremely difficult time Michelle Torres with Parcel Pending became a hero to my 7 year old daughter and myself. Michelle was so helpful, kind and empathetic to our situation. I called late at night thinking I would get an automated message but instead I heard her comforting voice walk me through the process and get the information she needed in order to help me locate the packages. Then once she was able to locate the codes she stayed on the phone with me while I walked down 3 flights of stairs and helped me until all 3 packages were in my hands. The world needs more people like Michelle especially in times these. Thank you for your kindness, professionalism and empathy.< /review>

A young woman named Michelle helped me try to track down a couple of packages that the post office said they had delivered. She did an exceptional job researching where they might possibly be. She was very kind, patient and professional, and certainly deserves a promotion and raise! Parcel pending offers a terrific service!</text>

Had a great experience with Parcel Pending customer service! I had packages getting delivered there with no notifications. I called the customer service number and Oscar Anguiano answered. He was extremely polite and knowledgeable of what I needed to do to retrieve my packages. It was almost 10pm at night but he took his time and helped fully enroll me and my girlfriend. I really appreciate the help Oscar!!<//text>

Great customer service. If you ever need help finding a package or getting into the unit, the customer support is just a phone call away. Melody helped me and went above and beyond to get a package that had been put in the parcel pending without a code. She was very nice and approachable and if I ever need help I won't hesitate to call again.</review>

Today it's Sydney's turn to deal with me and my package problems, and all I can say is WOW Parcel Pending, where do you find these awesome people? Sydney, you rock!

At our previous apartment, packages were delivered to our door - which is wonderful, UNTIL THE PACKAGES ARE STOLEN!! The security of Parcel Pending lockers is a cherished amenity at our new apartment. We are able to see exactly when our package is delivered and we know they are safe until we are ready to pick them up.<//Text>

I contacted my resident services at Irvine Company, and they were unable to figure it out. My husband called, and Parcel Pending yesterday and was able to figure out the sensor was not activated inside the lockbox, they asked us to call back with a tracking number. When I reached back out to Glory Viramontes at Parcel Pending customer service this morning, she promptly checked my account and I provided her with tracking/photo. She was extremely patient and literally walked me over to the package room and helped me retrieve my package, as it was placed in a different box than the one that opened. I'm very thankful, as this was time-sensitive. She went above and beyond, all whilst making me laugh at the whole ordeal that initially stressed me out. There should be more CS reps like Glory!

Danielle DeFazio has been absolutely amazing. I work with so many people on a daily basis and it is so wonderful to have someone as helpful and kind as her. If you ever get the opportunity to work with her you are lucky! I am glad I was able to work with her!!!!</review>

<review>We have Parcel Pending lockers at two properties I manage and have worked with Danielle DeFazio for close to 2 years now.  She made getting everything set up so easy and is always very quick to respond if we ever have a question about anything!  The lockers have also been a great added amenity for our residents and made our lives in the office much easier. I highly recommend installing them at your properties!</review>< date>

<text>Ms. Susan Miller showed me the best customer service I have experienced! During these crazy times the one thing I have relied on for my small business is the mail. Our complex currently uses parcel pending. Yesterday there was a mishap with my package and I called customer service and was immediately greeted by a friend voice, Ms. Susan Miller. It was difficult navigating what was going on but she was very patient, diligent, and worked efficiently to get it corrected. She did not pass me off to anyone else, she didn’t get frustrated. Her problem solving skills and knowledge for the company she works for is amazing and as a business owner I aspire to know my product just as she does! Very happy with my service today!</text><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

Parisa Ghandian-Wright was absolutely helpful!  I was very impressed by her customer service.  Had spent the past two days trying to set up an account online before finally calling in.  After she heard my trouble, she stayed on the phone with me the entire time and walked me through the set up process to ensure I had no difficulty and that everything went through correctly. That kind of follow through is so valuable but unfortunately all too rare.</Review>

ASK TO SPEAK TO MICHEAL!!!!! Up until I spoke to Micheal I was so fed up with Parcel Pending and the four other representatives I spoke to. He has AMAZING customer service, very personable, and tries all avenues to assist you in whatever you’re calling for. I’m so glad I spoke to him and he was able to find a resolution to my problem and in a timely manner. Thank you so much Micheal!!!!!</text>

<Review>Thank goodness for the UPS guy who told me to sign up for this service! Package theft is super high in my area, but I haven't had to worry about that since I started using Parcel Pending two years ago. Knowing my stuff is secure while I'm at work and easy to pick up when I get home makes me wonder how I ever ordered stuff the old-fashioned way.<//Review><rate>5</rate>< UserId.>

<Text>Melody Henderson was a STAR!!! She was patient with me while we figured out which locker it was. Then we tried a couple of times to unjam the locker and it finally worked! FedEx is famous for jamming boxes into the lockers that don’t fit! But Melody solved the problem! Give that woman a raise!

I never write reviews but just wanted to thank Sydney M. for helping me with nightmare delivery problem because Fedex couldn’t provide a code marked. My package was basically in limbo for days but Sydney tracked down my package PLUS the delivery driver!! It was some FBI next level, I can’t even explain. Thank you Parcel Pending and Sydney!!!<//Review>

Warning do not give these thieves access to your credit card number. They will charge you for storage even if you didn't order anything. Was on vacation for a month and these thieves charged up my card to the tune of $5/day for having nothing at all ordered.<//text>

I am a leasing agent at a property and residents packages always get locked in the locker and they are never sent a code. Their customer service reps have hung up on our residents, tell them incorrect information, and if they can get ahold of a rep they are on hold for a very long time. Horrible service and such a hassle. Not worth having. Definitely don’t recommend.<//review>

Awsome customer service!! Especially on Christmas day after unreliable postal service (ups) failed to read simple signs from the apt complex not to put any packages into the malfunctioning lock box.  The customer service here saved a Christmas for someone special.</Text>

I had an issue with not receiving text notifications about my packages. When I notified the company I got and immediate response from Noor. Once I explained the problem and the extenuating circumstances involving my health she not only fixed the text issue, she added (with my permission,) my husband’s number so he gets the texts too and she gave us a refund. This was all on a weekend and went above and beyond my expectations!</text>

Steven (Stephen?) Swerve told me to punch the locker to make it open, but informed me that id be held liable for any damages to the locker itself after it couldnt open. After asking for him to confirm that i was being given the ok to hit the locker by him on a recorded line, he hung up. When i called and asked for a manager i was told they'd give ve me a call shortly back. When i used the phone system the next day and requested a callback it never happened. Nothing seems to work at this company when it comes to getting answers or your packages. The pending part is that they'll hold your package for longer than what it should. Its convenient to have a place for it to be stored, but whats the point if the locker cannot open? My parcel sitting in a box, just pending dong for the amazing system to work, to punch in a 6 digit code and for the thing to malfunction. For the support people to claim to send an email to my apartment staff to retrieve my package, only to find out that never happened as well? I personally would rather take my chances of having my package stolen off my doorstep. Id get a refund faster from amazon than it takes to get my package out of one of these awful lockers.<//review>

We have Parcel Pending at our apartment complex. Amazon delivered our package, but we never got a notification. I called customer service and Sam was very helpful. He was able to quickly track down that it had been placed in the wrong locker (along with several other people's packages). Sam was a quick and effective communicator and gave me a number to call or text with any questions. A+ service.<//Review>

<Text>The WORST customer service experience.

After spending 5-30 minutes on hold (there doesn't seem to be much in between), expect to then have to wait minutes or up to 48 hours for a resolution to an issue like a package being delivered and not getting an access code for it. There really aren't many options or alternatives to waiting, since your package is trapped in some locker.< /Text>< pics>

I called Parcel Pending and this joyous man named Mic Buehler was on the other end of the line. We worked together to locate the offending locker. He attempted to open it remotely - didn't budge but made a sound. He then instructed me to kick the locker before reattempting. It was unsuccessful. Then he instructed me to kick the locker like it was a bad ex before our next attempt. I swiftly followed his directions and voila, the locker opened once he buzzed it open. Not too long of a wait on hold and friendly people on the line - Parcel Pending knows how to keep its customers happy.</Text>< Name>

<review>Really innovative idea, this company takes the boring mail system and turns it into an efficient modernized process. My packages are no longer left outside my door for hours, they are locked in safe lockers until I retrieve them with my unique security code. I am also texted immediately when my item arrives at my building, getting rid of the anxiety of thinking my package was delivered to the wrong address.

I have never had any issues with them and their customer service is remarkable. They require a small fee to continue to use their service, but having had 100s of dollars worth of items stolen from my door step while I am at work, this is a small fee. Now moving from apartment buildings from San Diego to OC I make sure they have Parcel Pending, or else I know packages are going to go missing/be late etc.

Parcel Pending is the next step in apartment buildings to stay current with technological advances. LOVE IT!!!<//review>< Pictures>

Love the concept and convenience of Parcel Pending. And when I was running into a potential lost package the team at Parcel Pending was super helpful and understanding specifically Syndey McGregor. Her sympathy for my dilemma was refreshing and that kindness restored my faith back in customer service. Way to go Sydney! Rockstar!!< /Review>

After spending 5-30 minutes on hold (there doesn't seem to be much in between), expect to then have to wait minutes or up to 48 hours for a resolution to an issue like a package being delivered and not getting an access code for it. There really aren't many options or alternatives to waiting, since your package is trapped in some locker.<//Text><gmapID>0x80dce9a99fc89803:0x19e29dc8eaffd1f9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Our apartment complex has been using parcel pending this past year, and I was concerned at first, because I didn’t know what would happen if a delivery person entered in wrong info, and you couldn’t get your package. I’ve had lots of trouble in the past with incompetent amazon delivery people. And sure enough, they enter my info wrong. I got an Amazon notification that my package was delivered, but no code through parcel pending. I called their customer service, and was helped by Michelle Torres who was super helpful, and got all the info they needed to try to find my package. I got off the phone with her, and about 10 minutes later they had found it, and sent me a code via the app, and I was able to pick it up. It was super quick and easy. So glad they could fix amazon’s mistake, and also glad my package was safe in a locker, as opposed to delivered to someone else’s door.</Review>

<text>Hmmmmm where should I start.... can we all just have a round of applause for Miss Sydney McGregor 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Anything I mean anything that we’ve had an issue with Sydney has come to a solution. So personable and outstanding customer service. She takes pride in what she does. If there’s an issue at hand Sydney treats it as if it’s her own. She will not stop until there is an resolution. Thank you Sydney for helping with any issue that I or my fiancé have had. We couldn’t thank you enough. This review was long past due my apologies!</text>< pictures>

Yeah I would rather drive 15 minutes to go grab the package from my parents house, than deal with customer service for the 5th time in two months. It seems like they only have 6 customer service representative for the all of the locations they serve across the United States. Always 45 minutes on hold for customer service and even with an audit of the lockers they can never seem to find my package. However, I will still receive notices that I have a package in the locker. It sounds like this company needs to have a better way to audit each set of lockers, since it sounds like previous tenants are left in the system.</Text>

<review>Kari Fjugstad was amazing! She truly helped me when no one else wanted to. I have been through a month long feud with Forever 21 and Ontrac because I never received my package. I was fighting for a refund by Forever 21 and they denied me because the package was delivered. Well turns out OnTrac put my package in the wrong locker therefore I never received it. I went to management at my leasing office and they refused to open up the lockers so I can find my package. I went to Ontrac to accept my claim so I can get my refund and they denied my claim. So I was about to lose $200 worth of clothes until my last shot was with Kari. She kindly said she would open all the large lockers electronically for me and on the third locker opening, there was my package!!! I am so happy and so grateful for her. No one wanted to help me and she did! She is amazing!!!! Thank you so much Kari!< /review>< pictures>

<review>Love the concept and convenience of Parcel Pending. And when I was running into a potential lost package the team at Parcel Pending was super helpful and understanding specifically Syndey McGregor. Her sympathy for my dilemma was refreshing and that kindness restored my faith back in customer service. Way to go Sydney! Rockstar!!< /review><Resp>None< /Resp>< Name>

WORST package system and customer service experience I have ever dealt with in my career. Couriers can't open lockers to place packages for residents and if they do, residents don't receive notifications or worse it gives them an error code and can't open the locker. This is on a frequent daily basis. Their customer service team is rude and not helpful in the least. They will just refer you to the office which in return the office gets frustrated because we have 412 apartments so the whole point of purchasing the lockers was to reduce resident traffic. Their package locker system is always malfunctioning and they expect the office to go out there to retrieve resident packages manually which you have to open EVERY single box and look at names which is VERY time consuming. They also expect the office to go perform maintenance tasks rather than send a technician. Ed Padilla, our account manager, doesn't care how frustrated we are, he will just ask us to keep going out there, reboot, take pictures, notify what boxes, etc. Knowing what we know now, we would have NEVER went with this company. Our future properties will NOT be signing up for Parcel Pending.<//Review>

I went on a one-week ski vacation and wasn’t aware that I could put a vaca hold on my deliveries.  I received a package while I was away and expected to be assessed additional fees due to fact that I was unable to pick up the package within 24-hours. Next, I sent a message to Parcel Pending asking what my options were. Mishell Zavala promptly replied to my email. She explained all my options and put a vacation hold on my account for me. Much to my surprise, Mishell told me that I would not be charged additional fees.  Mishell Zavala provided excellent customer service and was a pleasure to work with. She represents Parcel Pending most excellently!<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

SYDNEY MCGREGOR!!!! Unfortunately we’ve encountered some issues with packages going to wrong addresses with usps.

If you need a matter/issue resolved my only advice is to ask for Sydney. She goes above and beyond to research, investigate, and find the issue and resolves the problem! Very professional, and what customer service relations is all about.

Sorry we have to speak on not so good terms Sydney. Lol. But we appreciate all your help! Awesome is an understatement. Thank you once again.

Can I tell you that I had a great experience with Kashus. I work for Brio Apts and we have been having issues for a while, but no matter what happened, Kashus was there with a smile (over the phone smile) It felt like he was truly here to help me resolve the issue that we've been having.  Thank you Kashus for everything! Keep up the good work !<//text>

<Review>It only works if the USPS delivery person (mailman) is willing to use it.  Our mailman takes packages back to the post office and leaves me a card telling where to go pick it up at the post office; The mailman will not use the Parcel Lockers. It was a shoe-box-sized package, too.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<review>I had a problem with a jammed locker. I was really worried I wouldnt be able to get it, since it was already almost midnight, but I called the support number and was able to get it fixed.
Vanessa was really patient and I really felt that she wanted to help me fix my issue. In the end, after trying a bunch of things, I got the door unjammed. Even if we didn't that night, she assured me that she would contact the local office for me to help me in the morning. Thanks!< /review>< user_id>

Customer service was decent enough so I'm giving an Extra star. For me this service doesn't make much sense, and I surely didn't opt into it. My package is being held hostage in a locker that's registered to a prior tenant. I don't want to pay 20 dollars to register and 5 dollars a day for a locker. Leave my stuff on my doorstep its Newport Beach not Mogadishu</review>

<review>Ran into an issue with apartment not closing out prior tenant's account. Cheri fixed almost immediately. Bumping up rating. I think complications occur more with apartment management than with Parcel Pending itself. Willing to give it a try and so should you guys. Just make sure you guys set up accounts and stuff to identify and resolve issues before they occur.

Thanks again Cheri!<//review><user>105887032664932409529</user>< gmap_id>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>The lockers are great. The issue is they haven't done anything to ensure delivery companies can actually use them. So they sell you an expensive solution that ends up being useless. Parcel Pending needs to hit the phones and work with UPS and Canada Post to see how they can meet their needs so their staff will use them. At this point everything on Parcel Pendings website is a lie. Or at least a theoretical idea, as a parcel locker in a country where the top 2 major parcel delivering companies refuse to deliver to it is deception.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80dce9a99fc89803:0x19e29dc8eaffd1f9< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Original review - Such a gross middleman. Missing packages are never my problem. The company that ships it always replaces if something goes wrong. This company doesnt deserve to exist.

UPDATE: July 8 2020 - package is stuck in a locker. Called customer service to get it. They hung up on me. Now I’m on hold waiting for them to pick up. We’ve been affected by COVID for 4 months. You no longet get the excuse that it’s “high call volume”. Hire enough people to handle your service. 10+ minute wait times are worse than dealing with cable companies.<//Text>

Terrible customer service! They gave me a code for my package that i have been waiting for but only to find out that the locker was empty. Only got an email that they would look into it but never heard from them since then. Good thing the store i bought stuff from were kind enough to resend my orders at no additional cost and only took me one email! I wish our apartment complex would just get rid of their service! Id rather wait at my door the whole day for my package to arrive!<//text>

<review>horrible service! How can you not leave a file or photo of the package in your system. I spend 3 hours just to figure out the package in the locker box is mine< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>Terrible customer service! They gave me a code for my package that i have been waiting for but only to find out that the locker was empty. Only got an email that they would look into it but never heard from them since then. Good thing the store i bought stuff from were kind enough to resend my orders at no additional cost and only took me one email! I wish our apartment complex would just get rid of their service! Id rather wait at my door the whole day for my package to arrive!</text>< Pics>

This company is horrible. Multiple times they’ve double billed me the annual fee. Though they always acknowledge the error, it takes multiple calls over the course of weeks for them to reverse the charge. Their system also has frequent errors (e.g. a few times it thought I had moved for no reason).<//Review>

My groceries used to be delivered to my door, now they're delivered across the apartment complex. And if I get home after 9, I have to wait till the next day to retrieve them... It's a big hassle now.<//Review>

Had a poor rating at first, deleted that rating, the management,  solved the issues,  some mine, some there's,  non the less problems solved,  took some time. We are on same page now, this thing they call parcel pending is the greatest concept ever, no time limit on hours, you get a text message,  with a code number, you pick it up within 24 hours all is good, you tell them you are going on vacation,  they store it for you anyway, rate them 5 they should get 10</Review>

They don't offer a "service". You are given no other options if your complex chooses to have contracts with them. They force and trap you into using a system that delivery employees refuse to mess with. They force you to pick up your mail at an address completely different to yours, causing furthering confusion and packages being delivered to anywhere the delivery driver pleases once they realize how complicated the whole ordeal is. They make you pay for it and then call it a "complimentary service" to write off any and all complaints.
This company causes nothing but problems. The puzzle they've turned receiving packages into results in an abundance of  lost packages and high locker fees if someone sends something unexpectedly and you're too far away to pick it up.
I can't think of one part of being forced into this that I've appreciate or found convenient in any fashion.< /review>

So our parcel locker broke at the apartment complex I'm at, and when we asked the front desk lady what was going on, she said that she called their support and was hung up on when she asked for help. No alerts on their socials as to whats going on. Completely unprofessional company and now the whole complex's packages are stuck in the lockers because the delivery people are still able to drop the packages off. We just cant pick them up.< /Review>

Poor service. Not very professional and the business does not respect their customers. I have been having some problem with the service all the time. Recently they changed my status to moved out and did not send me any notification which resulted to a loss of packages. Poor management! No respect to existing customers!</text>

< Review>
This company is the worst. We were displeased when our apartment building decided to partner with a start up company and planned to stop accommodating packages at the front desk. We were assured this would be a positive experience and it has been anything but. Our names and information got scrambled with other residents. We had packages go missing with no explanation and had to work with Amazon, even though they had proof of delivery. Our account continues to have issues. Randomly the account just stopped working so we are back to picking things up at the concierge desk. We just recently got an email saying any packages sent to the front desk will be returned to sender so we are beyond frustrated! Terrible company, buyer beware!<//Review>

<Text>I honestly had low expectations with this service as my bf used it back in LA years ago and said it sucked...but last night the lockers needed a reboot at my apts here in NC (annoying but expected with robot lockers). I did wait on hold for a while, but after speaking with their friendly customer service human at almost 9pm my time, they personally texted AND emailed me within an hour of contacting them. They remotely reset the system and I was able to retrieve my package from the robot lockers. Thanks so much! :)< /Text></record>

My order doesn’t come to the parcel pending locker. Deliverers left my stuffs front of my door.
Meaningless service..

Update 6/13/2018:
I got the 1st parcel through “parcel pending” today. Let me inform about the service after months.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I have never seen such a brazen company in tm...
I didn't buy this business, because it is stupid to go through the community and pick up a package within the specified time. It is even more stupid to pay for it... This sb service not only has to pay a monthly fee. I have to pay the account opening fee, and the parcel will not be taken in time and will be fined.
The courier industry can't manage, just find a user's name, and then throw my parcel into it, even if the delivery. It happened twice in just one week. The parcel disappeared... I didn't have the code to get the parcel, the seller refused to pay. Because it has been delivery, the customer service has been calling for a few hours, and no one will ever pick it up. I am buying things now, try to choose fedex and usps, the two will not throw the courier into this locker box.
Black Heart Company, Garbage Technology.

我tm从未见过如此厚颜无耻的公司啊...
我没买这家的业务, 因为穿过小区, 在指定时间内去pick up一个包裹, 已经很蠢了. 自己还要付钱, 就更蠢了... 这sb服务不仅要付月费, 还要付开户费, 包裹不及时拿还要罚款.
快递员业管不了, 随便找个用户名字, 然后把我包裹丢进去, 就算delivery. 短短1周发生了两次. 包裹都消失了... 我没有code无法拿出包裹, seller拒绝赔付, 因为已经delivery, 客服打了几个小时的电话, 永远没人接. 我现在买东西, 都尽量选fedex和usps, 这两家基本不会丢快递进这个locker box.

Canoga Park Heating and A/C is a great company.  I've used them for years in 3 locations.  My unit needed some repair this time and Jose G explained everything which made decision making easy.  He showed us the old part and unit is working well.  I appreciate a company that I can count on in years to come.<//text>

<Text>We needed the rooftop  HVAC unit  and duct system inspected and problems diagnosed. Everyone who assisted us was professional, helpful and pleasant.

Response was very timely and tech, Jose Rivera, called to let us know that he was on his way. He arrived during time frame given by the great scheduler, Ben.

Tech, Jose, was masked and followed strict Covid 19 protocol.

He did a very thorough inspection, was kind enough to take pictures and send them to my email , and explained everything well.

The price for the inspection was very fair.

My partner and I were very pleased with the service from Canoga Park Heating and Air and rate them 5 stars.<//Text>< pics>

My Nest heating system has been having issues for a few months. Jose came out today to take a look and I was so pleased with the service. He was on time, very courteous and did an amazing job. I will definitely be reaching out to Jose again for all of my future HVAC needs. I highly recommend! Thank you so much Jose!</Review>

<text>I had Canoga Park Heat & Air at my house last Friday. My heater was making a strange noise I’d never heard before. The technician’s name was Johnny and he was a pleasure to deal with. He said it wouldn’t hurt to let the issue go for the summer and revisit it come fall. He could have said anything really. I will definitely be using them again.< /text>< Rate>

My maintenance service visit was  thorough and as always, Jose was courteous and helpful. He alerted me to a part that might need replacing in the future, but did not pressure me at all to take action until it was necessary. I appreciate that tremendously.<//Review>

We are very happy with the service provided by Johnny from Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning. Our AC was acting weird so we scheduled a service call. Johnny inspected the device and informed us that our thermostat was not working properly. Johnny installed the Nest thermostat and it is working beautifully. Johnny is very professional and extremely knowledgeable. Thank you!!</Text>

Johnny is very knowledgeable, detailed and patient. He always takes the time to explain everything and answer any questions we may have regarding our large systems. We highly recommend Johnny and all of the Canoga Park HVAC team. The Canoga Park office staff, technicians, install teams, really every person we have worked with has always been professional, knowledgeable, kind, and nice! The world would be a happier more peaceful place if there were more people like the Canoga Park team!</Review>< Pictures>

<user_name>RD Voo</user_name><review>Amazing how fast they came out during the hottest week this year. I called Friday night and they were there on Saturday!
They've been my go to for twenty+years

Turns out my combo heat and AC unit was 29 years old.  They maintained it so well. As it was time to replace it,  Dave came out,  chose the best one,  great price,  for my house.  They were perfect,  everything clean and did an amazing job.  The unit is incredible!<//review>< Response>

We have old units (1979 and 1986) and they've had no issue fixing them for us. We had Dave out today to give us an estimate on a new air conditioner and furnace. He was on-time, professional and the price was fair. We highly recommend Dave and this company.

After getting quotes from 3 different HVAC companies, we decided to contract with Dave at CPHAC for new Carrier furnace and AC equipment. We are very happy with the work done. Dave was super quick on getting back to us on questions we had both before and after the job was done.< /Text>< Pictures>

First and foremost, Dave has been Amazing! From our first interaction, Dave has been very professional, helpful. He helped guide us through our purchase of a new HVAC system without being pushy. Made sure we knew all about meeting codes for what we were looking for. After system was installed, Dave still answered our questions and continued to guide us through the inspection and permit process. The installation team was very professional and thorough.  We will definitely continue to work with Canoga Park Heating.<//Text>

< Review>
I just had a routine heating maintenance by Alan. He came with the appropriate PPE and did a thorough job checking the heating unit and air handler as well as checking for any potential carbon monoxide emissions from the heater (none were found) and appropriate heating output. This system was installed by Canoga Park Heating and Air Conditioning several years ago and has performed well so far (Heating and AC). My family has used this company for decades due to their high quality service and installations.<//Review>

<Text>I am surprised by all the wonderful reviews. We had them come out to check out our unit that was not working. When they completed inspection they said we would need repairs and refrigerant that would cost us $2500+. We we're close to pulling the trigger but decided to get a 2nd opinion. We had another company come out to check the same unit and they questioned if someone had been on the roof already because the power switch was turned off, the caps were missing and apparently they disconnected some wiring to a different unit. These guys tried to come and sabotage us for more money. We did need more of the refrigerant but we did not need any repairs or replacement parts. They probably thought we wouldn't have found out but I am so glad I got a 2nd opinion because these guys tried to screw us!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1611844849075, 'text': 'Hello Mr. Garcia. Thank you for your feedback but some clarification is needed. As it was it explained to you, two units were checked and the estimate given was to repair both units in your commercial space. The technician left everything as found until proper approval was given, nothing was sabotaged. It is very easy for another company to put a bad name on any previous contractor trying to impress customers to get the job. The technician did leave the switch off as the unit was not working properly to prevent further damage to your system. It is disappointing to see this review after it was fully explained and seemed to agree.'}< /Resp>

<Review>Johnny really helped us out. We were dealing with from our home warranty company putting off completing this job for 6 weeks!  Johnny came out, diagnosed the problem quickly, and was very helpful in giving us the information we needed to submit for reimbursement from the home warranty company. When he returned to actually fix our furnace, he did the job in less than an hour, had all the parts, and was very professional and courteous. 6 weeks of waiting was resolved in less than 2 hours thanks to this company!<//Review><Rating>5<//Rating><Resp>None< /Resp>< Pics>

Canoga Park Heating and Air is fantastic!  I have a regular service contract with them for my home and my rental property and they're always total pros!  Service tech Kevin has been servicing our systems and he's super knowledgeable and helpful.  We've had two major A/C systems installed by them at two different properties in the past few years and we're thrilled with them.  They know their stuff!  Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go sit in my perfectly-cooled 75-degree living room while the rest of the city swelters and sweats.</Text>

On this visit, the technician installed a new part (ordered from the manufacturer) which he had diagnosed on a previous maintenance call.  Installation was done without problem; my thermostat "checked" visually as well as internally (on wall); optimal temperature range recommended; next "step up" reviewed and quote given to me.  Cool air was welcomed;  job completed to my satisfaction.</Text>

<Review>I cannot say enough good things about Bob and his team. Bob was amazing at answering all our questions (and there were a lot).  He was patient and friendly and actually loved the questions and being able to help us get what we needed out of our system.  The installation was seamless, the team was clean with the work they did and didn't leave any kind of mess behind.  I had to delay the fire-up of the system a couple times due to other work being done in the house and Bob and his team were extremely flexible.  I am a tough customer and communication is very important to me.  Bob did not disappoint, his emails and phone calls were right on point.  Our household expect the experts to know their work and we research and check-up on everything we're told.  CPHAC was there 100% with every answer and accommodating every need.  If you want an amazing experience, simply call Bob.  He will get it done!<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Time>

It was the hottest day of the year so far and my A/C stopped working.   I called their office and spoke with Grace.  I was expecting to be told that they wouldn't be able to come out for a week or two but Grace was able to get somebody out the very same day!!  Their tech Johnny was great as well and very professional.  Changed out the capacitor and got my A/C working again.  If wish I could give them 6 stars for how they took care of me and my family.</Text>

He was extremely knowledgeable and able to explains the issues in a way that was very understandable. He made recommendations that I supported and we agreed he would be my "go to guy" for all future work. I have used Canoga Park Heating over the years and they have always been great!<//Review>< Response>

I went on the web site on Sunday morning and messaged them that my air conditioner had stopped working. They got right back to me and put me on the list to call Monday morning. They called Monday morning, made an appointment for early Monday afternoon. The service tech arrived on time and fixed the system. Great explanation of what had failed and what needed to be repaired. The air conditioning is working great now. They also installed the whole air conditioning/heater system 14 years ago and this is the only repair it has needed since that time.<//text>

<Text>They are very attentive to our HVAC system having installed a new system in 2012. They come out twice a year change filters and inspect the whole system.

I purchased my HVAC system from Canoga Park heating and A/C a while ago and they have kept it running perfectly for many years. Of course, after over ten years of no problems, my A/C decided to have a system malfunction, at night, while the weather reports were predicting 100 plus temperatures in two days. I called Canoga Park Heating and A/C in the morning and to my surprise, not only could they come that day, but they would be there by 1pm. We followed their app, knew who was coming and could tell  how far away Kevin was and when he arrived at the house... so we could mask up!  Kevin quickly found the problem, told me the approx. cost, but said it required  parts that might not be in stock. He asked for a minute to check and came back to tell me, not only were the parts in the warehouse, but they were less expensive than he thought. YAY! Then he told me he could pick up the parts first thing in the morning, but had to check the schedule and I should call, if I hadn't heard back by 3pm. I am so sorry I don't remember the name of the woman I spoke to, because she was wonderful. She put me on hold while  she checked with Kevin, and came back to tell me he would be here between 8-8:30am. I was  beyond grateful. Kevin, our super hero,  arrived the next morning, fixed the system in record time and just as the temperature started to rise outside.....The temperature  inside was coming down. I would say that this was the most stress free emergency service I've ever experienced. I have appreciated this company and their regular service for many years, but now I have a whole new appreciation for the service they provide and the wonderful people who make it happen.</Text>

Jose, was an excellent technician... He solved my problem in a matter of minutes, and now I can rest assured knowing my AC will last through these hot summer days to come and will filter out the polluted air from these fires.
5+++ Stars!

To begin Craig is not On the list to give a review for. Told him how to get on the roof and after just 10 minutes he came back and said he was ready to show me the quote. I know that he never went on the roof and lied. After I said that other companies said that a 2 ton would be more than enough he said he would not take the job if that’s what I wanted. What company turns down work like that. I asked him about the intake and out take being to small for a 2.5 or 3 ton he said that it does not matter. He seemed to not want this job and did not care at all about anything I would say. I will not call them back.< /Review>

Kevin found the problem with our A/C in minutes. He explained the options we had for repairs, and they had the parts for our 2007-vintage system on the truck.

We asked some not-on-the-order questions about our system (duct/flow issues) and he didn't hesitate to climb in the attic to take a look. Unlike other places we've talked to in the past, there was no pressure to do things that did not need to be done.

Professional, can-do attitude and got results. Highly recommended.</text>

<review>Overall we are very happy with the service we received from Canoga Park. They installed an entire new HVAC system to replace our non-functioning evaporative cooler and old furnace.
When Dave came out to give us the estimate he was extremely knowledgable and understood what we were looking for. He was able to get us a great system without taking us over our budget.
Throughout the install the team was very respectful and covid conscious. They cleaned up after themselves before leaving each day.
Even after the install was finished, when we had concerns about some leftover ductwork, Dave came right out to take a look and fixed it on the spot.
Would definitely recommend Canoga Park Air Conditioning!</review>< user>

<Review>For once, I felt the technician was focusing on finding the problem instead of confusing the customer with different issues to complicate matters.  Kevin found the problem, unplugged the main A/C drain pipe from the bathroom plumbing and redirected it into a bucket under the basin.  Unfortunately, he couldn't quite explain the wet in the wall.
Although I still need to call a plumber to complete the task and find the cause root of the damp in the wall, I am satisfied with his work.
One improvement, the company did tell me about the $85 call out charge which only goes towards parts and I since didn't have any parts needed changing, I lost there.. The company did not tell me about $120 hourly rate either. Overall, you can put your trust in the company.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1594218769034, 'text': 'Thank you for your 5 star review, Karine!

Jose Bolanos was the service man that came to my house. He was on time friendly and highly knowledgeable in his field.
He took his time working through his lunch to make sure both my heating units were serviced according to my needs. He Cleaned the filters, he made sure  there’s no gas leakage, and added Freon to the unit. He also installed a Nest thermostat for each unit so I can control the temperature from my IPhone.  Thanks to him I don’t need to replace my units. From now on I will use Canoga Park Heating & Air.  👍

Thank you Jose, you did an amazing job!😊</Text>

Such a nice guy! He was on time and so courteous and Covid safe. He came in, accessed the filter and lines and main unit. He gave us a complete run-down on everything and replaced the filter and cleaned up and set us up for a payment schedule and was done in about 30 minutes. Such a pleasure to have him here today.

9/25/20 Kevin Castro came today to search for the smell we keep smelling coming from the AC. He did a thorough inspection and did not locate any problem. He was on time, with a mask and so nice. He told us about another service that can be done to eliminate contaminates in the air and we will be looking into it and may have them come back to set this up for us. We were really happy with our service, again, today.

Allan just came for another filter replacement and unit check. Everything went well. He was in and out in no time and wore a mask the whole time. Always a good experience. Thank you!

Last time: Allan was just here to replace our AC filter and do a check up on our unit. He was on time and thorough in checking everything out. Gave us some great info as well. Great experience! Thank you.</Review>< user_id>

My heater failed the day after “safe at home” went into effect, and I was able to get service the same day. The tech showed up within the service window, in protective equipment, and finished promptly. He let me know there was an immediate problem and a potential future problem, and allowed me to choose what to fix. The price was fair. I love this company.< /text>

< Review>
Canogas Heating & Air's Bob Wiseman was patient & professional in assessing my needs and presenting his proposal. Bob answered all my questions clearly. I used his company for another installation 18 years ago, and I look forward to getting a brand new 5 ton package unit. Had an issue with my old house wiring, and they went out of their way to solve the issue quickly and professionally!<//Review>

Bob Wiseman and his team including Kevin, Jorge & Salvatore were all very easy to work with and the job was completed quickly.  Knowing that the split unit has a 10-year warranty & I can rely on Canoga Park Heating and Air Conditioning to fix any potential issues down the road gives me peace of mind.</review>

I'd been struggling with my Nest thermostat for a couple weeks--restarting, reprogramming--before I called Canoga Park Heating and Air.  Why didn't I call them sooner????  They sent Kevin who arrived promptly at 8, donned his booties, and went to work. It turned out to be a heater problem, which he fixed and explained to me.  He also changed the filter on my heater and gave me more info about my Nest. Above and beyond, Kevin. Thanks. Now the system is working great. I heartily recommend this company.<//Text>

<Review>Got a quote and was extremely relieved that they said I didn't have to replace EVERYTHING (which all other quotes I got said I had to do). I will save more than half the cost by just replacing what they verified has gone bad, and can save the rest of the system for a future repair. I appreciate this kind of honesty and it makes me want to do business with a company like this.< /Review></record>

<Text>This was our first experience with Canoga Park Heating & Air Conditioning.  We have relatively new Lennox units and have been remodeling so needed one hooked back up and needed some duct work tweaked on the other.  Dave was on time, courteous, incredibly knowledgeable and honest.  He spent time getting up to speed on what we needed and absolutely acted in my best interest when he told me that while he'd love to have our business, we would be better reaching out to our original Lennox dealer.  He then offered possible solutions for our duct work.  I tried to pay for a service call and he simply said the visit was complementary and that their philosophy is not "a customer for the day", it's "a customer for life". I  am sad we aren't able to work with Dave and Canoga Park Heating & A/C. I highly recommend them!  In addition to Dave's amazingness, the company texts reminders and alerts when the technician is on his way. They include a photo of who's coming as well.  A top notch company!

After their technician Johnny came in and diagnosed the problem with my heating system, he suggested to replace the circuit pump. Few weeks later the part came in and he replaced it but there was still no hot air! Then he said the problem is with the water valves and I need to call a plumber to fix it. And still demanded me to pay $1200 for a service that has not fixed my problem. How unprofessional is this? I spoke to Ben in their office today and shamelessly he too wanted me to pay this amount!

I do not recommend anyone to use this company.< /review>

Allen arrived and was very friendly.  He explained everything he intended  to check and thoroughly went about his business checking the AC refrigerant level and operating controls of the outside unit.  He gently washed the fins of the exterior unit for better air flow.

He also checked the forced air component inside and temperature levels coming from all room vents.  Very professional!</text>

Canoga Park Air continues to offer the better quality and service.  Most recently CP Air installed a new 4 ton unit in Simi Valley.  The installation was done as promised.  The technicians used all the Covid safety precautions we hoped for as we are in the high risk category. The system works great.   I recommend this company without hesitation.</Review>< Pics>

Eddie was awesome!  He made a service call after hours to fix my heater, so I didn't have to spend the week freezing while waiting for Saturday.  He also got on the roof to put sealer around a vent that was leaking rainwater.  Wonderful,   I'm telling all my friends.  Canoga Park Heating/Air Conditioning is the BEST!<//Text>

Jose Bolanos was here to install our new NEST thermostat. He is super knowledgeable and friendly, and made sure that we knew how to use the Google Home app to adjust our thermostat when we’re away from home. As usual, our expectations were exceeded. That’s why we’ve been loyal customers for over eight years.< /review>

Johnny Reyna arrived promptly at the earliest stated time and was friendly but business like. He exhibited an excellent knowledge and took time to explain what he was doing as he worked. When questioned about the problems he was looking for and what symptoms might develop he was quick to point out that the needed repairs should only be done by a qualified professional. What was even better was his more than favorable appreciation for his employer. Johnny is welcome to service our HVAC system any time. Good Job!< /Review>

Johnny was on time and immediately got to work. Showed me the filter was okay until summer checkup. He was pleasant to speak with and completed his work in an efficient manner. He remembered providing service here before. Wished us happy holidays.
I continue to be completely satisfied with the maintenance service CPHVAC has provided over the last four years since they installed the complete heating and AC system.</text>

The tech was great and thorough. However,  Inspection of HVAC system for purchase of house.  I must have misunderstood, I thought . I would get an estimate for repairs from the technician that came out but have to have a separate tech come out.  Since I don't yet own the home this is problematic!  In essence I paid to service the existing homeowners system and to learn what was wrong but without the estimate for the larger repair.  Wish it could have been done in one visit.<//Text>

Excellent service!! Kevin clearly and throughly explained what was wrong,  what was needed,  and how he solved our problem.  He  also explained how we should use the appliance to prevent over loading it thereby prolonging the life of our AC unit.  We will request him  next time we have an AC or heater  issue. Excellent!!</Text>

I was told that the service charge would go towards any work I had done. Guy said he couldn’t give me a price to repair my unit because only people in the office can do that. Told me we needed our new thermostat wired correctly, I asked how much to do that he said $120 ok fine wire it correctly then and I’ll use the $85 service fee towards that. NO CAN DO! I’ve unplugged the system upstairs because the wires are bad. What does that have to do with you hooking up my new thermostats correctly???? So let me get this straight....you can’t give me a quote on repairing my system, you are refusing to do any work while your here, and you want me to pay you $85 which is supposed to go towards any work I have done, but yet you won’t do anything!! And you still think I should pay you!! No way. You completed wasted my time and only wanted to collect a fee for doing no work at all!!!!   Shame On You!!!< /text><response>None< /response>< rating>

<text>Jose B. is very friendly & professional. He called to see if he could come ahead of the scheduled appointment which was better for us. When he arrived he explained the procedures of what he was going to do. He was very efficient, and when he installed our Nest Thermostat he showed us, step by step, how to adjust the thermostat, and helped me put the app on my phone.  He was wonderful.< /text><rating>5<//rating><user>109116358123939645479</user><Response>None</Response>< Date>

Eddie the service tech did well, except for tracking leaves in. He was very helpful at explaining some things that I can do my self to save on $$. He was also friendly and good worker. Only trouble area is getting a receipt with my correct name and address on it. Started with wrong first name, last name, city, and zip on both billing and Job address. After three tries by email to get corrected receipt, they still have wrong first name on Job address, but I am giving up on it. I am glade Eddie's knowledge of AC is better than their ability to write receipts.</Review>

Our heating unit went out on one of the coldest nights this winter.  This company couldn't initially come out the same day but while I was calling around, they called me back and was able to come out that morning. Their service man, Kevin, was very polite and efficient in assessing the problem. He had to order and pick up a part but was back as quickly as could be expected. He took care of the part installation and we were warming the house back up to a livable temperature in record time. I was very pleased with the result.

The a/c tech from Canoga Heating and Air came out today to install our new Nest thermostat as part of DWPs program. Jose came out and did the installation and inspection of our system in about an hour and did the job efficiently and professionally. Based on Jose’s work, I would definitely call Canoga AC for repairs in the future.< /Text>

<rating>3</rating><review>Eddie has been to my home to service my air conditioning/heater unit several times. He has always been on time, polite, knowledgeable, and professional.

A different tech recently visited my home. When I changed the filter myself months later, I noticed that he put it in upside down. This makes me wonder if he was competent in doing the other tasks that I am unable to check. I have contacted the company but  there has been no follow up from them.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Dave was on time (even a little early!), super knowledgable and friendly. I can tell Canoga Heating & Air would do a wonderful job installing a new HVAC system. Their price seemed a bit high but I get the sense it is reflective of the kind of quality and attention they would put into installing and maintaining....recommended.<//Text>

Canoga Park Heating and Air is the most professional and honest service provider I have ever came into contact with. The fact thier service guts don't work off commission gives me a piece of mind that the service is done correctly without, "hey you need a new this or that." They come complete the service and educate me on how to conduct proper matianance in between our annual checkup.

Two thumbs up and highly recommend them for all your heating and AC needs.</review>

<Review>Canoga Heating and Air replaced our HVAC 15 years ago.  The installation was smooth sailing.  The system has been fantastic.  We have regular service.  The technicians are professional, courteous,  show up on time and they even wash the unit.  They always clean up after their work is done with a wonderful attitude. We usually get the same technicians.  Eddie just left,  he found a bad capacitor, he showed me how he tested it and he replaced it avoiding a system failure.  They are a family business and we feel like a part of their family.</Review><gmap_id>0x80c29c130a13496d:0x47ed47c9f3625480<//gmap_id>< Rating>
