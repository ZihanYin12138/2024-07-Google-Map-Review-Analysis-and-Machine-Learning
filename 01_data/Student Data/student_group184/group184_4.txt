< Review>
2 stars are for the wait.  We had reservations and were seated on time. We waited over 30 mins to order our drinks. Once we ordered our food, it took over 1 hour to be served.  The food is unique and taste good but not worth waiting for.  I did inquire  about the long wait when I  paid $$$, they said 1 cook, 1 waitresses, 1 bartender were out. They did not expect the demand for the day.  My advice call and ask them about the service wait. If you get there and are hungry you might be eating a couple of chip baskets. We were there mid week Tuesday evening.</Review>

< review>
Ok tbis place is very interesting. The decor is very neat in terms of being corful and every table colorful along with colorful chairs don't don't match. That makes it extra fun. The art is also very nice, very traditional to a state in Mexico might be Oaxaca but I'm leaning more to being the State of Guerrero but I can be wrong. The food is great. I ordered a dish that came with bacon wrapped shrimp stuffed with Marlin and some vegetables 😋👌.  You can also order the Matlin stuffed Shrimp as a taco 🌮 so you will definitely not go wrong. I order an Agua de piña/pineapple water, it was very good. The menu items all sound interesting and will likely go back to try something else.

Let me tell you something. Just come here. A review won't give you the entire experience of just how AMAZING the food is. Mexican seafood is normally not something I crave so when I tried this place, I didn't expect much. Now it's one of my absolute favorite places to go. My sister doesn't even like shrimp but somehow this restaurant was able to convert her.

I recommend the ceviche dishes because they are ABSOLUTELY to die for. The best ceviche I have ever had. My mouth waters just thinking about it and I wish I had more!

Spiciness Rating: Moderate-High
If you don't have a tolerance for spicy food, I'd stay away from anything that has "house spices". I LOVE spicy food and there dishes made me order multiple glasses of water. So be prepared if you want that extra kick, but it's definitely worth it! The spiciness of the food doesn't take away from the flavor!

Health Rating: Moderate-High
Most hole in the wall Mexican seafood restaurants don't have the freshest fish nor do they have many healthy options. Rest easy knowing that their seafood is fresh and you can definitely taste the quality. I recommend the octopus dishes! They also have vegan options as well so go nuts!

Atmosphere: High Quality
Stepping into the restaurant, you're greeted his with history, culture, and art at a blend of traditional and modern taste. Dining in is a must just to experience all of the beautiful Mexican art work, as well as reading the origin story of the restaurant. I could sit there forever and take in the scenery.

Service: Low-Moderate
Normally when it comes to my dinning experience, service is 50% of my interest. How often do they come check on your table, do they refill drinks, are they friendly, etc. And when it comes to service, this is the only downside to this restaurant. Whole the servers are friendly, don't expect them to be attendant. I'd expect this if a place was busy, but I have been here three separate times with varying levels or business and it's still a hassle to get their attention. There were only six tables seated and many servers but it still took multiple times to get a cup of water. Normally that's fine for me but not when my tongue is burning- While I would normally bump a star down for service, I can't do that! My heart and stomach loves the food too much to do this!

All in all, definitely try it! I BEG you to try and see for yourself!< /Text>

Also the staff was very kind and prompt buyI was disappointed with the quality of the food. We had two different baskets of very stale chips. And we came here for the tacos because we read the reviews saying they had good tacos but they were very subpar again the tortillas were stale and the meat had a very weird smell and just didn't taste right. But thankfully the fish taco was really good. Just didn't eat the tortilla for the fish taco. The quality of food was not good at all. Very disappointed</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Food is upper scale Mexican food. I highly recommend the pulpo and ofrenda. If you looking for cheap food truck tacos this is not the place. It’s a sit down and enjoy complex Mexican cuisine. Only problem was hard to see waiter to ask for items. I had to get up and walk in to ask for extra condiments and water. Perhaps it’s a culture thing or not enough waiters for a busy sat night? No complaints on food. Will return once in a while. Definitely can be a tapas style mexico cuisine.<//text><GmapID>0x80c2d91a9557cc5d:0xe37b49e737b101c2<//GmapID><Name>conan teng<//Name><Time>1601188114710<//Time><user_id>110521235564665000891< /user_id>< Response>

< review>
Fresh Otopus Ceviche, great presentation and interesting favor combinations. Really like the colorful interior, it is a happy place to eat and enjoy seeing many creative ideas throughout the restaurant. Definitely one of the great restaurant in the area, hipster invasion is coming to El Monte.
Absolutely five stars from my experience.< /review>

<Text>Such a great place and everyone especially Alex was exceptionally kind and provided the best of service.  It may seam a bit pricey at first glance but you will leave not only full but happy you tasted such well crafted food and drinks.
The Ceviche with octopus is now my gold standard, which I reluctantly ordered in fear that the octopus would leave me disappointed like it does at most places due to its less fresh or on the edge of being a bit gummy in firmness. I was so wrong, it had the creaminess of firm cream cheese.
Also you need to get the Shrimp with heads, so many good flavors in those delicious bugs.

I don't recommend many places but my friends that enjoy good sea food will be getting an earful from me very soon about this place.

Sorry, no pics of what I ate but there are already alot of good photos of there items already.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
The food is okay very small portions for a very large price I asked for a steak and I get little three strips of steak House expecting a little bit more for what I paid play $4 is very old and price for what I got three little strips of steak and a couple of teaspoons of vegetables. Alcoholic beverages super expensive and very watered-down up on the alcohol not worth it. All I will not recommended and I will never ever ever go there again</Review>

Really good upscale Mexican food. There's a good amount of experimental dishes on the menu which does a great job of modernizing traditional Mexican food. Outdoor seating available which is great for this year ruining pandemic.< /review>

Service is horrible. Do not order through their website. You supposedly get 15% off but the code doesn't work. Food is ok, but service is just not worth it.<//review>

<username>Anthony Turgman<//username><date>1576558140673</date><Rating>4</Rating><text>This place is definitely trying to infuse culture and food. Love going here, but gosh, it's expensive. I can't often justify spending $4-5 on tacos, but I guess every now and again it's worth it.

Food selection is cool. Ordering online is confusing as hell. GrubHub doesn't have all of the actual menu offerings. Servers over the phone are a pain to work with at times, but in the end they'll make it right.

Beautiful women behind the counter. Tip of my cap to them - they do great work .

Been here a number of times, tried almost everything. I stick to the tacos mainly as everything else isn't sized well for the price. At least the tacos are a pretty decent size and the gobernador tacos are absolutely delicious.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The exterior as well as the interior is reminiscent of Latin inspired colors and culture, staff was friendly, they had a smoker outside actually smoking meat (insert drool face here), they also had veggie options for those in your group who do not eat/consume meat.

Portions are small, not a bad thing just don't expect a huge taco when you order just one, ample parking and prices are slightly above average but food and atmosphere are more than worth it<//review>

<Review>The food is delicious I've been wanting to go for a while. To my surprise The portion sizes are extremely small. They used to be twice as big. Service is mediocre.  We asked for extra salsa and they said it was 2$. I dont know if it's because of new management but I liked this place better before.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

The workers here are very nice and it's a nice place to come eat. The only problem i had with this establishment is that the asada taco didn't have much flavor. Overall the was the only problem i had but i definitely recommend coming here because they're many options</Text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Food was okay but service just sucked!!! We ordered one taco, some oysters, camarones amarama, and one additional plate that I can't remember the name of . We waited for around 40 minutes before any of our food came out. I would have thought that maybe the food would have come out in phases (taco first, then the oysters, etc...) but it didn't. We ended up cancelling the oysters because they still didn't come with the rest of the food. We then complained to the manager (some chubby guy with glasses rocking a white Torres dodger jersey) and he couldn't give two sh$ts about our experience. He basically just walked away. This must be his first time managing a restaurant.

To add insult to injury they only gave us silverware for one person. Since the waitress wasn't coming around we just had to share the silverware. Needless to say we won't be coming back.</Review>< pics>

The food tastes healthier than I expected aguachiles were really good the best I have ever tried. But service was really slow and all the people working there seemed lost they don’t have many options as far as drinks and food either, it felt as if they cared more about look then service or food.  I would go back only for aguachiles and probably to go and I will be ordering at least an hour in advance due to how slow it is< /review>

This is not your typical Mexican Restaurant.
Loved the food, atmosphere and service. You have to visit yourself and have a great experience.< /Review>

Woah, this place was good! Wish I would've taken pictures of the food but I seriously under estimated this place. The asada plate was the best! And I feel the portions were just right. Not too much food ☺. But anyway, cute little spot, food was great. Will probably hit it up next pay day fosho!<//Text>

They gave us plenty of chips & salsa.  I ordered 2 tacos de Asada  tortillas hechas a mano/handmade, aguachiles $20 which is pricey for the small serving size. Agua de Pina $3.95  served in big Mason jars and delicious.  Every one full, satisfied and back to work :) Thank you!< /Review><date>1555622295440</date></record>

Food is good but lately we don't know what to expect because they can't stick to one way of doing they're dishes, they're different every time we go in, idk if  it depends on the cook of the day or what  but cosineros  please get on the same page.<//Text>

Hi i was there earlier today for food and drinks and we asked if they had a Happy hour menu and they said they did not have happy hour so when I got home I called the restaurant and the girl that answered I asked her what time happy hour was and she told me all day so I don't know what that is all about but some body is not telling the truth not happy at all I won't be going back there< /Review>

We have new team members that are still in training. She should have asked her supervisor. We apologize for the confusion. Our happy hour menu is on our website, xecorarestaurant.com and on yelp if you would like to review it. We also offer a free Agua Fresca drink with yelp check in.

<text>This place has some amazing tacos! Normally when you think of tacos, you think of street tacos but this place truly elevated those $1 tacos to another level. I opted to try the of three tacos: pastor, Ensenada Style with Fish, and Volcan with pastor. All three came out nice and hot on freshly made corn tortillas. The tortillas are soft, except the Volcan, which came out on a crispy shell. Honestly, I would've ordered more and stuff my face l but since all tacos were generously portioned, I couldn't have another bite.

Another thing my friends and I enjoyed were their tortilla chips and salsa; we couldn't get enough that we asked for it twice. However, it was a bit too salty for my taste but still delicious.

I'll definitely come back for more in the future. Try this out if you're in the neighborhood or want dinner really good tacos, you won't be disappointed.<//text></record>

(Translated by Google) Well this was my favorite restaurant, I do not know what is happening but the service is very disorganized I think they are taking more care of the appearance of the same than to please the customer. We were waiting more than 20min for drinks and when they were going to take me They didn't have the one I asked for, I switched to another one and it took another min. And so they would tell me that I didn't change again and they can't believe either! And I want to point out that it wasn't full I think there were only four tables.

(Original)
Bien este era mi favorito restaurante, no se q está pasando pero el servicio está muy desorganizado creo q se están ocupando más por la apariencia del mismo q de complacer al cliente.Estuvimos más de 20min esperando las bebidas y cuando ya me las hiban a llevar q no tenían la q pedí cambié a otra y tardo otros min.y para q me dijeran q tampoco volví a cambiar y tampoco pueden creer !😔😡a y quiero destacar q no estaba lleno creo q había solo cuatro mesas.< /text>

<text>Their food is really good ! The pictures speak for themselves. I ordered fettuccini Alfredo with chicken , the texture is on point , it's really creamy and the flavor of the taste if very rich , it's also come with a peace of bread . I also got a side order of a pizza slice .
I give this place 4 stars because their never reply to their Google reviews which means the management doesn't really care about their customers :( they also only have 8 pictures on here ( including the two that I posted ) .<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl-cXhSX2nbxmTn8uFc3Wfh5waKnaJUhA9O5Pj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv3vJCWJb_i2xvwuGEpcPjVpTmFhVPvpHBZRYn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<Review>Ordered delivery through slice. We ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and half and half different veggies. The pizza was delivered very quickly. Probably because it hadn't been cooked enough and there was no pepperoni or sausage on the pizza, only the veggies.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>This was my first time ordering from Ameci. I had heard good things.

The delivery guy couldn't figure out how to get to the elevator of my apartment, so I put on a jacket and walked for 4 minutes to go down three floors to meet him despite the order saying it would be left on my doorstep.  The $4.50 delivery fee and tip I paid up front felt a bit unearned. Then when I get the food up to my apartment, I see the salad is not the salad I ordered. Fine. I pick off the meat and peppers. Then I (foolishly) poor the dressing over the salad. I ordered Blue Cheese. Then I notice the Blue Cheese is a bit thin--because I was given Ranch dressing.

The pizza tastes good. But I'm not sure it's worth all the mix ups. I thought I'd try someplace new to me. I can say I tried it. Again, the pizza tastes good. Yay for that.</text><userid>105893157153440471543< /userid><rating>2<//rating><user_name>Scott Delgado< /user_name>< resp>

Don’t listen to the one star sub sandwich guy, this is a pizza and pasta place. Don’t get it twisted. I only tried the pizza & it is delicious. It was from my first time ordering from here tonight. I’ll be definitely ordering from this place on the regular.<//Review>

My number one choice for Italian food in the area! The complimentary garlic bread alone deserves 5 stars. Plus the pasta, ravioli, and pizzas = 5++++! Everything taste authentic and homemade. All the sauces are great. Portions are generous. There are always left overs for me which I really enjoy because that means I get to eat it again for my next meal.</Review>

After all the hype on yelp, my husband and I went to check out Little Star.  I had prepared myself for a 30 minute wait - at least, but we got seated immediately.  I think being a small party helped.  Great pizza!  GREAT pizza!  We ate every bite.<//text>

<review>I had a classic deep dish and have nothing but positive things to say about the pizza. Wouldn't get this that often since it cost around 20-25 for a small pie but would not hesitate to go here again if I'm craving deep dish pizza.< /review>< pictures>

horrible experience . For future reference attitude of your cashiers goes a long way, no matter how good your food is theres a lot of room for growth and maybe training with your very rude staff. I WONT BE COMING BACK< /text>

<Review>Ameci’s has been in Irvine since the early/mid 90’s and I have been going to this location since I was a kid and pogs were in style... it has always been consistently good. The fact it has stayed in Irvine for so long ( as Irvine is a place that has churned and burned so many businesses over the years due to Donald Bren operating Irvine like a dark lord sith ) is a testament to what they do well and that’s delicious Italian food for a reasonable price. They are always my go to place for pizza delivery. To be honest I haven’t had pizza I have disliked there. I also really enjoy their antipasto salad. I just got done today with a long week at work and just ordered two jumbo sized, two topping pizzas special for delivery . It’s good stuff.<//Review>< pics>

< review>
Decent Italian food and it's a good bang for the buck. I have eaten almost all their food items except for a dish with sausages and broccoli, a meat lasagna dish, and a couple other items.
This of course has spanned about 11 years.
My first experience with Ameccis was in Fountain Valley at Magnolia and Talbert, where the first thing I tried was linguini and clams... Superb. Then I tried other items.
I was so glad to find them at a location in Irvine, as I was doing business for a few weeks there.
They are franchises and I think the consistency of quality at each franchise is remarkable.
They have a nice lunch specials, great pizza, and plenty of individual items.
Their prices have not really increased over the years, however, I do believe and I suspect the circular tins they put their food in has gotten a bit smaller. I just remember the portions weighed maybe 15% more and seemed bigger 10 years ago. It's just an observation and not really a knock because their food is so good.</review>

<text>Took over three hours to get our pizza. Three hours!! After waiting one and a half hours we called and it turns out they overlooked our order. Then,  rather than placing our order on high priority,  we just went to the back of the line. Will never order here again. This is ridiculous.< /text><user>111246768241095563655<//user>< Response>

<rating>4</rating><Review>I have been coming to Ameci for years now. I usually buy the Italian sub.. for some reason I like theirs better than most. It is toasted, has a healthy portion of ham and salami and the olive oil and vinegar dressing they use is particularly tasty..

Decent location, in a popular shopping center with ample parking area. The fellows taking care of the business not always the friendliest but not rude either. It is primarily take-out however right outside there is a nice court yard where you can enjoy your meal in the open.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I'll never Order again from this place. The customer service is always bad. I placed and order for delivery and waited almost 1 hour and 45 minutes,  no pizza was delivered. When called back they said it was for pick up. Total B.S. because they asked for the office address and said it would be $3 delivery fee! Sorry you didn't even care that to offer a pizza or anything to save me as a customer.
Never again will my office order from Ameci.  !! We spend $ 1000 a month</Text><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dcddd909c228b1:0x9eb3657cdf0a83fd< /GmapID>< user_name>

Worse experience ever. Do NOT go! Always told different things. Was supposed to be done in January but they keep adding shot for us to do for them to send off our paperwork. Go anywhere else!</Review>

<GmapID>0x80dcacfea05e5033:0x3680e11d01af7589< /GmapID><Review>In general, this college was extremely unorganized and unprofessional. Every single meeting/ appointment planned before classes started ended up beginning 30min-1.5 hours late. It felt like a huge waste of time to get to any appointment on time. The first day of class, our instructor arrived and hour and a half late and class starts at 8am so I could’ve easily gone to eat breakfast somewhere. Apparently she hadn’t been notified of her start date until the week before so she had a night shift the she couldn’t call off and made it to class with no sleep. On top of the lateness, all of our orientation paperwork was lost so we had to resign and refill out everything (including sensitive information like social security numbers) so it felt very uncomfortable to know that those papers were lost somewhere. Paperwork was constantly misplaced. Our final state exam date wasn’t communicated to us until it was about 3 weeks before the exam so if you had plans during that time, you either had to reschedule it yourself or cancel your plans. In the end, it was supposed to be one day and ended up being rescheduled to a different day because of lack of organization so just another example of being unprofessional. Our instructor was not trained in teaching CNAs and was not properly prepared in the material for the state exam however she did do the best she could. At the same time, though, I did feel like a lot of time was wasted in class due to being off topic and having no planned activities. There was a lot of unused time and space in the classroom and I felt like I could’ve learned everything online with the amount of time wasted. The organization of the nursing school (but more specifically the CnA program) was far below expectations. If I were you, I would gladly take my money somewhere else.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

<resp>None< /resp><review>If you are contemplating Summit College, please avoid this school at all cost. They truly don’t care about the students. They only care about taking the money out of our pockets. I know COVID-19 is a new experience for all of us but Summit College literally has no control over this situation and its real disappointing. They were such in a rush to get students back into that tiny a** school, they have potentially exposed at least 100+ plus to Covid-19. Before going back to school summit college told students they had  certain protocols in place in order to protect our health. Unfortunately my first day back at summit (June 1st) showed me that the protocols set in place was something that looked good over email but nothing in that email was followed once students returned to school. First thing first, they told students that temperatures were going to be taken at the door before entering the school. THAT WAS A LIE! We were given questionnaires about our whereabouts other than school that instructors were suppose to collect to be reviewed. THAT WAS A LIE. They lied to San Bernardino Country about social distanting. Some classroom were too small for us to social distant in. All I'm saying is if you're planning on attending summit college I would wait until this pandemic is over! Summit college is letting us down :(

P.S.  Don't let these old a** photos on here fool you. All the equipment in this school doesn't work, have mold growing on it or is outdated. Don't waste your money here< /review></record>

<review>Hi,
I am just going to finish my HR Payroll Program.
I am an honor student of your college.
i was really satisfied with my instructor Mr. Kevin Blake. He has a lot of experience in his field . he didn't teach us professional growth only but he taught us personal growth as well. He always support and motivate us.
I am very happy to have the opportunity to learnt with such experienced teachers like Mr. Blake and Miss Sonia (Career Development Instructor).
Thanks for the Institute to provide us quality.

I was very disappointed in the quality of education Summit College is providing. I dropped out the LVN  program. I paid a registration fee of 150 dollars that I wont get back. But i left the program before I was committed to 20k debt and OBLIGATED to pay 20k for tuition. You only get 5 days so careful on how long you stay there. For a new LVN school they should have hired a experience instructor. She did not know what a syllabus was! It does not matter how much experience you have as a nurse but the matter of being able to teach it. The instructor did not know what was on the PowerPoint she was lecturing on. Ms.Crowdus was definitely winging it. And trying to skip curriculum. You cannot skip curriculum in nursing! It's a standard for a reason. Everytime the instructor read the slide she kept saying "I think what it's trying to say..." what do you mean "you think it's trying to say" ?!?!?!?! Unacceptable. She could not even answer my questions. Additionally to her response on the PowerPoint,  the instructor would say "I didnt know that" after reading a paragraph based on the powerpoint. How could you not know? Very unacceptable and very unprofessional. The instructor lost 3 hours of lecture, skipped curriculum, Additionally to not lecturing for 3 hours she would get OFF TOPIC ALOT. We as students cannot lose time in a 12 month program! There is alot of information to retain. I left in tears today. I know my last name is a color, however it should not be assumed and misspelled as BROWN. Like okay you forgot my last name was Black you're gonna remember it's a color and assume its Brown?!?! How do you assume my last name?! Is it because I'm a brown woman? I was insulted! After crying due to feeling discriminated and  feeling like I was just another body who was willing to pay.  After everything I went through they should at least given me a refund of my registration fee. I went to Concorde. They made Summit College look like a joke! At Concorde college if you are military affiliated  there is extra grant money to aid for tuition. I felt like my education was valuable there and they truly care about the students! I was welcomed with joy and made me feel like I belong at Concorde  College. I met all the wonderful staff and they were all excited to meet me. I surely did not feel like a piece of meat. Run run run run as far as you can from this campus all they care about is your money but hey if you want to be treated like a piece of meat for all means go for it.</review>

I’m currently attending this trade school. And all I want to do is bring these problems to light. I have had 4 different instructors since I started this program. And here I am sitting in this classroom at 9:25, Class started at 8:00 and I do not have an instructor for my class present. The instructor for the beginners class is having to come over and give us assignments and then go back to teaching the newer class. The main campus has heard our problems and don’t seem to care about what we have to say. They have made promises they can’t keep. “ we will get you a new instructor.” “I will see what I can do about getting you refunded.” “We can allow you to stay here until you feel comfortable with what you are being taught.” These a just a few things I and my classmates have been told. I just hope the ones in charge of the ones who “run” this school see this and realize things need to change and they need to happen now!<//text>

<text>My review is in regards to the LVN program:
This school provides schedule flexibility and great equipment for "real life" practice.
The classroom sizes are small and comfortable.

The two complaints/concerns I had were towards their enrollment processes and their current passing rate. The passing rate has dropped down to 70%, which is rather low in comparison to other LVN programs in the general area. And due to my distasteful experience with their enrollment team I'd like to simply state the following; Understand that these types of schools are a business. THEY make money off of students. That being the case, remember, you are the schools biggest client and should be treated with respect. Their "are you good enough?" approach to enrollment paired with a condecending attitudes towards potential students was enough to make me walk away.<//text>< response>

<review>Overall good experience studying here at Summit! Great instructors in clinical setting as well as in theory classes. Student body were very opinionated and complained a lot about the school but I personally had no problems because I tried my best and was always staying on top of things as an adult should, no games here people, worry about your own grades and stay courteous. .

Employees don’t care about the student succeeding, they only seem to care about the money. I was able to get through the first semester with one retake (I was told I had 2 retakes), then had to use the other retake for the second semester (struggling with personal issues and couldn’t make it through the semesters). They wanted to charge roughly another $4000, but as far as I knew I already paid them for all 4 semesters, not sure why they wanted the additional $4000, on top of that I called and left a message so I could talk to them about this problem but nobody ever called back. Very unprofessional. I should be getting a refund on the last 2 semesters since I paid for them but was not allowed to take the last two (because of the unpaid additional $4000). Very unhappy with this school.<//Review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Review>Went in to grab some info on the welding program. I already weld for a living but thought it wouldn't hurt to go back to school and learn some more. I went in to talk to an admissions advisor. Man, I didn't know what was going on. I was told to go here and talk to this person. And didnt know why, then back to this person without knowing why. Back and forth. I decided I would come back after doing my FAFSA at home. I came back the next week and the financial aid officer told me I could take out a loan and had me fill out paperwork. When I saw the Interest rate and the amount I would have to pay back, I said let me talk it over with my girlfriend and my family member who is an accountant because I didnt want to take a bad deal. The lady, a black woman chuckled and said hmmm okay in this tone that was demeaning. I had a bad feeling. Now i went back to talk to the admissions advisor and get some paperwork to look over at home.
21 percent of the students with loans defaulted. That number is really concerning.
I looked at the salary rate for graduates.
It ranges from 15k - 35k
I make more than that. Why go to school when I already make more than this.
After talking to some people in the field, I got the consensus that Summit College does what's called "cattling" where they get as many students as they can, get their money, and whatever happens to you, happens. They already got their money so they're happy.
I was really hoping to hear good things about this school, but I'll just stick to learning elsewhere.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

This place is a rip off no matter what program your doing there better and cheaper programs that are a lot better then summit just research and google. If your in the welding program they aren't gonna teach you any real welding. Charging all that money for nothing and the electrician programs are a joke</Text>

This school is extremely racist.  During an open book we worked in groups to complete. In our group we had to black people and one Hispanic person. We all compared answers. We all had the same answers. Why did the hispanic person get a "B" and the two black guys get a "D"? Same answers. Same test. Instrurctor actually said to the Hispanic student "They look out to ensure their own are more hireable".  Don't go here!<//Review>

I am so excited to say I will be starting the LVN part time program in about 2weeks.I started going to summit in 2011 & graduated top of my class from the Medical Assisting program. I have been in the medical field ever since, I am now looking to expand my knowledge and provide more care to patients. If it wasn't for summit career college, I wouldnt be where I am today! Great advisors and teachers, most of all, it was fun and worth all the trails. If you aren't ready to commit yourself 110% this is not the school for you.<//review>

Although the classes were great and I did graduate the top three percent of my class, I am not working as a medical assistant. When I first entered the program as an Medical assistant, I was promised the sun moon and stars and they did not deliver. they do not have a working relationship with Loma Linda and the career service coordinator put me in a filing clerk position instead of a back office medical position. The job leads suck as they pulled them from craigs list. what a waste of time energy and money. There are other programs out there... seriously do not waste your time with this school.</Text>

<Text>I wouldn't have attended if I could have a do over. Hind sight always being 20/20. 80% of the time they're making you do busy work.  Because they have nothing real to offer. The school, the program, even that old woman the D.O.N. are all a complete joke. The D.O.N. Mrs. Shanahan has a napolean complex caring more about being in control than actually doing her job, showing preferential treatment to her daughter and her daughter's friends.

You should look to a community college. It might take an extra year. But it'll be an actual education at a fraction of the price. The price at summit is about $8000 every 3 months. And with a price tag that high they still have the audacity to charge $60 for their lab manuals.
If you drop out you are still on the hook. Not to the school but to the government. Remember this is a for profit school. Its first about the money and education is second/ third.

I finished the program and I knew some of this going in and I still ended up regretting my decision to attend.  Non of these courses are transferable. Once you start you have to finish at this school.

I just graduated from the LVN program. It was hard, but they provide a lot of resources to help the students succeed.<//Review>

Racist staff! Students referred to by the "N" word regularly by the director of education. There was this one good instructor but, he got fired after complaining about the racist comments.</text>

<Review>I attended this place back in 1997 in their Graphic Design class.  The 3D modeling portion of the course was useless. It was like teaching someone to draw using crayons.  The program wasn't even an industry program.  I learned useful programs like Photoshop, but they didn't teach the industry standard Adobe Illustrator.  Instead we used Corel Draw ... which hardly nobody in the industry uses.  We learned how to use Quark but now nobody uses that either.

It would be an interesting coincidence to mention that the spell checker in Microsoft office likes to replace Summit Career College with the word "Scam".  If you are going to that school, try it.  Kind of entertaining and telling, don't you think?

Their career center is pathetic and useless other than being able to use their computers and fax. Their guidance counselors did nothing to help us find jobs as promised.

Our externships were ruined by the school changing how it did things midterm and doing an internship print class that basically sat around and played on the computer all day and did nothing for several weeks.  I had a chance for an externship at ILM and they screwed that up because they wouldn't help me with the paperwork after I was PROMISED help with externship paperwork.  So much for an amazing career right?

The great instructor that we started out with (the school made him made and chased him off) was traded out from some cocky self absorbed douchebag who thought very highly of himself, yet failed to produce any artwork that would impress me.  He knew little to nothing of 3D design either. The last month of that class was wasted watching him wildly click around the screen trying to figure out how the 3D program worked ..... greaaaaaat.  On his first day when we asked to see his website so we could see some of his designs, he refused and said it would just discourage us from moving forward.  I managed to google the clown up and found that he was a pretty low level designer with no real talent, or history.

After going to additional real colleges and learning some more programs, I managed to become an art director for a large graphics company. Very little thanks to Summit.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

Do not go here. It’s impossible to speak with somebody on the phone, you will continually get transferred to voicemail after voicemail. Poor quality teachers, poor quality student services.<//review>

First time visiting a frozen yogurt since moving back to Cali 2 years ago &y family & I will definitely be back. Both employees were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The location was clean and and the staff was willing to assist and remain patient as my children are young. Definitely a great first impression experience.<//Text>

Love This Place! Everything Is Fresh, Yummy, Clean, & They Treat You Nice & Are Very Curious! They Change Up Their Flavors Monthly ( I believe ), But Will Also Bring Back Your Favorites If You Don't See It On Your Next Visit. Love This Frozen Yogurt Place! My Fav!< /review>

When someone needs to use the restroom, they give you a suspiciously phallic like ribbed plastic 'wand'...if it could even be classified as such (pictured =\) with a meager selection of unpopular flavors and unresponsive teenage staff, we left without creating our treat. I don't recommend this business to anyone.< /text>< Pics>

Great fro-yo. Wish the website would tell you the flavors they had in real time so you would know if they had what you were looking for. They should also make a way to vote for your favorite flavors. I love coffee or mocha fro-yo but they only have it sometimes.<//Text>

Well what can I say when I'm in the mood for a tasty Froyo treat there is only one place I go and that's the Tutti Frutti on Hesperia Road not only is there a slew of flavors and a slew of toppings but the customer service is off the charts you could even say its down right fantastic. So if you want a nice tasty Froyo in a clean environment without a bunch of Hassle and Bs then go to the Tutti Frutti and you can trust me because I'm fat and I know what good food is. 🤗 👍😁👍<//Text>

The frozen yogurt here was nothing special to me. There weren't that many choices of yogurt and not a good variety of toppings. At least for me because there were hardly any chocolate toppings. It seemed to me like they were more into unique toppings than having the good ones. It was very clean though and the staff was friendly. They did have a no sugar added and a Splenda sweetened yogurt that was diabetic friendly.<//review>

<text>Being here many many times and having my card stamped for free yogurt on the tenth one I was told I couldn't use it because it no longer was good on the card it didn't stay that it expired but she told me somebody had stole the stamper and they would not take it that really upset me not that I didn't have money but I burn my 10 visits and felt I should have got my free yogurt she kind of was like accusing when she said somebody stoled it and we don't know who has access to it like it was me who stamped all my punches thank you tutti frutti for making me feel like a victim although we did have our yogurt me and my granddaughters cuz we frequent that place and I will go back but I am going to call on this issue<//text>< pictures>

This is a great place to take someone weather you are congratulating them or mabye you just want to have a nice dessert, this is the place to be. me and my mom have been to a lot of  yogurt places, but this is by far the best of all. I hope you go and you won't be disapointed.<//review>< Pictures>

I thank this "team" and will recommend and will do business again with TOM DAVES and TEAM.. Thank you 👍< /Review>

She helped me sell a rental property and purchase a primary residence.  My rental property sold in 2017 when the market wasn't as hot as it is now.  She reached out to multiple leads which led to multiple offers.
She also helped me search for and buy the house that was perfect for me.  Lindsay takes the time to understand your families needs to find the perfect house you may not have even known was the perfect house.  I gave her criteria of what I was looking for which was limiting the results I was finding.  She convinced me to check out a house that fit all of the criteria but was slightly over ($15K) the budget I had set for myself.  She found the perfect house for me and my family.  She handled everything (negotiations, inspections, contracts, etc) to make the process smooth even when the seller made it difficult. I've recommended Lindsay to many family and friends, all of used her services and have been extremely happy with the outcome.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1619020199554, 'text': 'Thank you for the review Janet!

Any questions that we asked were answered quickly and we were given great advice. Start to closing only 5 weeks. Over $60,000 above our asking price. We would use them again and again.

Thank you

We have been a client of Lindsay Carlile for over 5 years now and we could not be happier. Her knowledge and expertise of the industry allowed us to not only maximize the profit off the sale of our house but also saved us thousands on the buying end.
Lindsay is a growth mindset individual keeping up on the latest laws, regulations and trends of Real Estate which keeps her skills on point.
She is real, honest and sincere and we felt as though she had only our best interest in mind during the entire process.
We are always referring her to people we know who are looking to buy or sell and when we move in the future, Lindsay will be the first person we call.<//review>

Dawn handled our buy side.  She was professional, very friendly and she made herself available any time we had a question.  If she handled sale side also, it could have worked out better, maybe.  Anyway, we appreciate her constant communication very much.< /Review>

Lindsay Carlile was our realtor/broker when we sold our home last year. She went above and beyond to make sure the deal was successful!  She is professional, personable, and respectful of her clients needs and concerns. She is also very sensitive and understanding to the amount of stress involved with moving. My husband and I highly recommend Lindsay as an outstanding realtor.<//review>

Natalie from Tom Dave’s Team was the BEST realtor I could have hoped for. She went above and beyond. She anticipated needs and met them all with a smile on her face and expert advice. She was aggressive with the sellers agent and loan company when needed. She was so compassionate and sweet. She kept me informed of every situation no matter how good or bad. Natalie was super responsive. I just can’t express how AMAZING she is. She was an absolute pleasure to work with and made the selling of our home and the purchasing of our new home seamless. I feel so blessed that she was our realtor. All of Tom Dave’s Team was amazing! THANK YOU!</Review>

We had a great experience working with Tom - we were buying and selling all at once and Tom and his team were wonderful at putting our minds at ease.  Prior to listing our home, Tom gave us great advice about when to list our home and how to be prepared for listing at any time.  It worked out perfectly, negotiations went smoothly, and we love our new home!< /review>

<Text>If you have the misfortune of living in a house (as a renter) listed for sale by these people, they will make your life miserable. Their staff is unprofessional, and inconsiderate. If I could give 0 stars I would. Most times, clients show up early to tour the house,  and show up  without face masks, or the agents themselves. Tom Daves (and team)  are driven by greed and don’t  care about stepping on people to get their commission pay. They seem to forget people still pay to live at this address..  Already reported one of his team members to the BRE for making an inappropriate  comment, which I reached out to the Dave’s team to address, but it fell on deaf ears. Would not use these people or recommended them to anyone< /Text>< pics>

I can't say enough about how great our experience with Tom Daves and his team was! We had a very difficult situation with having to sell our parents' house when they passed away, and we didn't know what to do. Tom and his team treated us with such respect, and they kept us in the loop every step of the way. They provided superior personal service, and no matter what time of the day I contacted them, they always responded quickly and helpfully. They got us a sale quickly, and answered all of our questions about the process. I highly recommend Tom and his team to anyone looking to sell, or buy, a home. Thanks, Tom!!!</Review>

I have reached out 2 or 3 times for different things regarding their listing which I am currently living in and never did I hear back what so ever. One of the reasons for contacting was regarding a disrespectful and unprofessional agent of theirs who I actually filed an official complaint about but wanted them to know that said agent is not allowed to come back, but never got a response from anyone even acknowledging they got my message. I have also contacted him regarding my availability to view the house so I didnt have to decline everything that wasnt in my availability but i still have to do that as well because I never got a response regarding that either.
Unfortunately I'm not the home owner, just a renter, so I obviously dont matter to them, but it is still very unprofessional. If I needed a rental agency I wouldnt choose them.</Text>

We were very nervous about selling our house as it was only the second time we had sold our house and it had been 14 years. Tom was great. He help us get it ready to sell and got it on the market quickly. We had two offers the first weekend!

We bought our new house after looking extensively throughout the area. Tom and his team were very patient with us and kept looking until we find the perfect home. He is very professional and does whatever it takes to make sure that you are completely satisfied.  I would highly recommend Tom Daves!<//review>< pics>

It has been great working with Tom Daves and his team. Even if you're not quite ready to buy or sell, Tom has a wealth of information about the process in this willing to share it with you. He took the time to walk through my home with me and provided excellent market analysis. Only someone with other people's interests at heart would spend their time doing this and it meant a lot to me. I highly recommend Tom.</Text>

Tom and his team represented us as both a seller and buyer agent.  His sound advice for listing our house for sale was spot on and we received an offer immediately.  His staging professional provided excellent and realistic advice at what buyers want to see, his photographer took some of the most amazing pictures we've seen, and his listing manager kept in close contact with us always communicating any updates.

Purchase of our new house put us in contact with his lender who provided competitive rates, wonderful customer service, and a down-to-earth approach throughout the entire process.  Tom's assistant was in touch with us at all times with quick and thorough answers to our questions.

Tom oversaw the entire transaction and was always available to answer questions and help in any way.  Having a team means there are no delays as the work can be delegated to many competent team members, and this is why he is so successful at what he does.

We highly recommend the Tom Daves Team to anyone who wants the job done right.  Many thanks to Tom, Matt, Brianne, Jon, Ally, Natalie, and Andrea - you made a potentially stressful move into a seamless process.<//Review>< Pics>

Tom is the best agent around. He and his team care about their clients personally and they go above and beyond what most other agents will do. He's been in the business a long time and knows this area well, there's a reason he's been awarded one of the best agents for Keller Williams on numerous occasions. Give Tom a call when you want to buy or sell, you won't be disappointed!< /review>

Both properties sold within a week!
Tom's team provided professional advice to prepare the properties for the best possible price.  Tom has associated professionals that assisted us with repairs and "freshening up" the properties.
I do recommend Tom Daves of Keller Williams Realty!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1619122966827, 'text': 'Thank you for trusting us to help you! I appreciate the review and kind words!'}< /response>< gmap_id>

Two stars is not reflective of the teaching staff or the professors at all. Rather it is a review of the administrative staff and the counselors. They offer little to no help at all, often times having no clue what is going on. I do not know what they are getting paid to do because it seems as if they know little to nothing about any questions, issues, or concerns that an individual may have. If you attend be prepared to deal with a lot of confusion and frustration in regards to counseling and dealing with administrators.< /review>

Veteran friendly, staff is helpful and resourceful. Teachers are well versed in in their respective fields of study. The college is hidden away from a lot of distractions. The library is well connected to outside databases and sources and staff is also well versed in finding the book or resources to have the book available to the student.  Food is pricey but its convenient. Overall empathetic and respectful with student activities. Great start.<//Review>

<Text>The admission and counseling departments needs to truly be there for their students otherwise why even waste their time. This the time to get your life organized but without good teamwork from all sides, there’s no point. I highly suggest going to another community college!  Don’t let them waste your time and money.<//Text></record>

Avoid at all costs. Instructors force you to show them your room before a test/quiz during online classes and if you refuse to do this you are dropped from the class. Massive security risk and incredibly inappropriate<//review>

Bad with emails and answering calls-- the best option is to physically go to the school and ask your questions. I had submitted a form for my transcripts to be requested to a specific school and had sent the form to the desired email Las Positas had stated, however, I had received no reply both times I submitted and sent the form.
I also called them and stayed on the line for half an hour, and I still received no answer.</review>

The campus is nice and well appointed. The teachers mostly seem well versed in their subjects and able to speak passionately to them. The greatest weakness here is the counselors. They do an inadequate job of clearly communicating program paths, options, and requirements. The physical school and curriculum are good, but the counseling administration is so bad, I considered rating the whole school lower.< /Text>

I attended Las Positas College in my younger years when Las Positas was just opening it's doors and I attended again and received my A.A. Degree in Liberal Arts & Sciences with an emphasis in Social Science in 2017. I was also Editor in Chief of the Las Positas College Literary Anthology. At all times, with every instructor I had and every Las Positas employee I was treated with respect and caring. The teaching staff are one of a kind, helpful beyond the call of duty, encouraging, they understand the strengths and weaknesses of students and give them the direction and guidance they need to succeed. The campus is clean, the students are friendly. It's a wonderful learning environment conducive to the learning experience as a whole. The cafeteria serves great food. I have attended other colleges and Las Positas College is by far the better choice. I am proud to be an LPC  graduate and I reccomend it highly. If you want to attend a school where student success is of the utmost importance and you would like to enjoy your learning experience and grow in many ways LPC should be your school of choice.<//Text>

The campus has a partnership with the Lawrence Livermore Lab where scientists come in and give talks on research in the auditorium. Students also receive opportunities for paid internships at the lab.

Great campus that I recommend highly, especially for science students.</text>< pics>

<date>1473120680706< /date><Text>You know how everyone talks trash about community college? Well they shouldn't. I have two AA degrees from Las Po and a BA from CSUEB. I value the education and experience I received at Las Po so much higher, I pretty much wish I hadn't wasted my time at Cal State. There is such a broad range of basic college, continuing education, self-improvement, exercise, and job training courses at this school. It's a much more affordable option for sure. One huge difference I noticed at Las Positas was the level of service you get from the counseling staff. Also from the Veteran Services Office, because I'm a veteran--Todd Steffan was the single biggest help I've ever had in getting my education. I had a wonderful experience here and I'm actually thinking about coming back for some continuing education/self improvement type stuff.< /Text><Name>Brian Gates< /Name></record></dataset><record>

My name is Mary Bagorio and I attended LPC first in 1977 -79 and again in 2015 to the present. I graduated in May 2016 with an AA Liberal Arts & Science/ Social Science. Great staff, students and instructors! Always friendly, helpful, patient, and caring. With winning ways to motivate students the Instructors are amazing. Their positivity and dedication to bettering the education you receive makes LPC rate at the top. The Campus is clean and beautiful.
The educational experience is one you will remember with fondness. Every opportunity to succeed is right in front of you.  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐✨✨💫<//text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>I literally wasted an entire year here. Some of the teachers I had seemed uninterested, and looked like they would rather be somewhere else. Some wouldn't really give out any homework so you didn't really know if you were learning the material, and others weren't great at giving directions on assignments. Just go to a different college.</Text>< pics>

I can not express in words only how much I have groomed and learned here.
The teachers love and support the students,the librarians and the computer lab teachers go out of the way to help and they reach out to the students.
The buildings are clean,ample space for students to sit and relaxor study.
Te cafeteria is awesome with  a lot of choices and place to sit down and watch flat screen TV.
Very clean facility ,lots of friendly people and zero chances for being bullied.
I have attended many colleges like Mission College in Sanjose,Ohlone College in Fremont, Merrit college in Oakland, Chabot in Hayward
and they all are nice .
Las POSITAS is special.very special.
Hats off ro all the teachers,student body and the student community and all the other staff for such a brilliant time that Ispent here.
Iam thank ful to you all because you care.</Text>

Counseling Office is a joke. Sat on hold for 2 hours, finally someone picks up the phone and before I can even reply they hang up. Horrible service at times.</Review>

The manager doesn’t believe their customers.

After I talked to the teller Mustafa he said the manager will be here to help you in seconds. After I waited for her she failed to waive a cashier check fees of $10.00 only even though I have told her I don’t do cashier checks often and usually they waive the fees, her response was: what is the name of the branch that waived it for you before, and the name of the representative!
I told her: Why do you need these information? You already have it in my account!
She said “to call her and tell her she is not supposed to do that?

Excuse me!

I am closing all my accounts very soon because of your attitude. Worst Wells Fargo branch ever!<//text>

I went in on Monday December 7 at 10 AM spoke with the receptionist sandy and made my appointment for Tuesday December 8 At 4 PM since they had no other available slot due to covid they are appointment only. I called to confirm my appointment with no answer,
mind you I left work one hour early and lost an hour pay for this appointment to open a new debit card. I thought since I have a car loan with Wells Fargo a debit account would be beneficial.
If I could rate this place zero stars I would! never go to this branch the receptionist was so inconsiderate and unprofessional.. They made a mistake on my appointment then continued to tell me that I never made the appointment as if I was lying very unprofessional I would not advise this location.<//text><UserId.>102005905479017755410<//UserId.></record>

First of all, WellsFargo need to hire more tellers, because they are always short and the process will take way too long. Also, they need to teach their security how to respect. Overall, I will rate this bank ZERO not even one start.<//Review>

When my turn came, the teller told me I must register my name with the manager outside and when I entered the is nobady outside to register my name. I waited more than 15 minutes, and then the manager told me "my bad" I don't see you I have to write you name and you have to wait to help all the customes then the teller help you.</Review><UserId.>117119329109201557873< /UserId.></record>

Spent an hour waiting for a banker to help my son sign up for a new checking account.  Signed in, and was asked multiple times what the name was, and what were we there for.  We kept being told we were next, and it never happened.  Finally left in disgust after the bankers that were there disappeared for over 20 minutes.  Thank you to Chase bank for getting us in with someone in 5 minutes and out with a new account in less than 30 minutes.  Customer service is a wonderful thing.  Maybe one day Wells Fargo will learn that.<//Text>

What a joke of a "bank" the only thing you can bank on here is high fees for everything.. and they hassle you to death check double check verify, call your references, take your blood, finger prints, run a background check and your credit and then you have to mortgage your children just to make a deposit in cash! This is everytime with valid ids ...three or four of them   are a must and this is for long time customers who come in every week!  WOW! Oh and they DO NOT want U.S. CURRENCY! !!<//Review>

<text>Service was great, honestly. They were accommodating and friendly. The place was clean too! My friend and I had a mani-pedi, and while the experience was good overall, the quality of the service could have been a bit better. My friend's pedi got messed up multiple times even though we waited quite a while before leaving. 4/5 of my nails on one hand had to be redone as the color started to bubble, and one of my overlays was not fully glued down to the natural nail. Overall, i might rate 4/5 stars but really it was just that there was so much to fix between the two of us before we left that I didn't rate higher.< /text>< gmapID>

Since I never tried one and I didn’t know what I saw signing up for,‘I said yes. I hate it! The services are way below standard and not a great value. Everything was rushed and not super precise. While sitting there, I missed even the most mediocre nail salons in NYC. If I ever come back to San Diego, I will never feel tempted of going to that nail salon again. It was the worst! My pedicure was ruined as soon as I got back to the hotel - bad quality products! No, I do not recommend this place to anyone. Awful!<//Review>< pics>

My friends & I came in at 9am before our trip. They were able to get us in and out on time. I love my nails and toes. We’ll be back anytime we’re in town. Thanks again.<//Text>

I LOVE THIS NAIL SALON!!!!  Because of my job,  I always have to get short nails.  They always do an amazing job  on my short coffin style nails.  I usually get a pink and white acrylic,  and they have been the only shop that does the ombre effect PERFECTLY!  The prices are perfect too, which is great since you have to pay for parking (freaking downtown).  I'm just in love with this place.<//Text>

They did  a great job! And considering my nails were all messed up from moving that's saying a lot LOL. Price is very decent too especially for downtown and well worth it!<//text>

The hand and calf/foot massages had a nice, deep pressure, and you can tell they take pride in doing a good job. I am visiting SD for just a few days, and I would highly suggest others looking for a reliable salon to trust Plaza Nails - they won’t disappoint!< /Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

They told me they couldn’t do anything I wanted not even a basic French manicure because I wanted it done with regular polish not gel. They just want to nickel and dime you. Don’t waste your money go somewhere that is happy to have customer.</Text>

Excellent service. Friendly staff. Great prices! Best basic manicure I've ever received and it was $15 - lasted a week and a half! Basic pedicure $25. FIY - prefer cash only and have an ATM in the salon. They also offer $1 off if you use their ATM.< /review>

I walked in when it was a little busy and without an appointment and was sat down in a chair within 10 minutes. They were not pushy with anything different from what i had wanted. They made sure that i liked the length of my nails and any concerns i had with my nails and fixed them as soon as i noticed anything. I am more than happy with how my nails turned out. I would definitely recommend this nail salon. Good prices and affordable.< /Review>

Worst manicure ever. I felt rushed picking out colors and I had a few questions about different services but they made me feel like I was being a bother. I ended up getting a powder dip ombré and he didn’t do anything with my cuticles, at all. He didn’t clean them up, push them back, or trim them. It just looks awful.<//review>

<review>Really upset with my visit today. I was seen an hour after my appointment and three walk-ins after me finished a whole hour ahead of me. My pedicure was a disaster. Lopsided cuts, uneven filing, and a messy paint job. I pointed it out right away just to be assured it looked great. I asked several times for them to look at it and they barely gave me the time of day.<//review>< Pictures>

Great experience! I'm a visitor and wanted to go some place close and picked this salon based on past reviews. I'm very glad I did. Possibly the best experience I've had at a salon. Friendly staff, relaxing and my hands and feel look perfect.< /text>

<text>I had just flown into town,  needed a Mani/Pedi, BADLY, and it was Easter Sunday. I noticed not many places were open but Plaza Nails and Spa was, and when I arrived this place was hopping, some pun intended 😉 There was quite a wait, but it was worth it! Great quality and the customer service was impeccable. Thank you!!</text></record>

The place was very clean and open, and all the women did a great job for my mom and I. They took the time to be precise and thorough, and yet were fast. Great polish options too. If you go to their website they have coupons too.< /review>

The best salon experience we've ever had! The facilities were clean and inviting, and very sanitary. The foot baths were lined with plastic that were changed with each use, and the tools were freshly opened. The staff was friendly and gentle, and took their time to make sure you received a positive experience. I definitely recommend this salon to anyone looking for a mani or pedi.<//Text>

<GmapID>0x80d953581842c1b3:0x8818f22187f8e9f8<//GmapID><text>So disappointed with my manicure. My “dip” lasted less than a week. Probably my worst dip manicure to date. I hate to give it such a low rating because the staff was attentive and friendly but I can’t believe that I paid for dip for it to last as long as a regular manicure.< /text>< Time>

<text>Worst. Experience. Ever. Was in town for a conference which had a two hour window to “refresh” so several women attending the conference decided to go here to get our nails done. The manicurist cut my cuticle. Badly. There was so much blood that one lady with me thought that she had spilled nail polish on me! Decided to end the manicure right then and there - but then they tried to charge me for the whole service. Please...My cuticle was still bleeding several days later. Don’t risk I‎t!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80d953581842c1b3:0x8818f22187f8e9f8< /gmap_id></record>

Sandwiches are not wimpy.  Pick your bread, meat, vegetables, condiments and add extra to create your signature favorite. Try having one their way too.  I love the Perry's Ranch! Best deli sandwich and made in front of you.  Always fresh and they dont skimp on what's between the bread. Local chill vibe, seating inside or to go.  Highly recommend!!< /review>

They also accept orders over the phone if you are in a rush. Great selection of ingredients. Their rocky chicken sandwich is by far the best fresh chicken sandwich in town.< /review><rating>5</rating>< Response>

They accommodate in every way possible.  Food was great, gluten free sandwiches added to the menu.  The guy behind the counter saw that I was holding a lunch meeting and ran the wifi password out to me before I could even ask.</text>

Stopped for quick bite off 101 freeway in Novato. Lots of choices, top notch service, good flavor and value. Single person bathroom clean and big, hallway to it a little sketchy (part of their back room). Will mark it for future use< /text>

Been going there for years, best deli and staff in all of Marin county.

Not only are the sandwiches delicious, they also have fresh, hot Rosie rotisserie chicken!</Review>

I love this place! Great sandwiches, quick service, call ahead. The bread is always fresh  and they do gluten free if that’s your jam.
Grab and Sando and go have it with a pint at Beercraft next door.< /Review>

Used an old napkin. Did not use a clean napkin, the napkin he used was dirty with spots of oil on it. Cute nails but he charged me so much for something  so small. $58 for something worth 35-45 honestly. They do not sanitize their nail equipment, I did not see them stand up to go clean it or clean it in-front of me. I’m just disappointed that they charged me so much. I think they added themselves a tip because they knew I wasn’t gonna tip them because they were being mean to me just because I wasn’t sure what color to get.< /Review>

She made them look lumpy even though I payed her to fix only the broken ones. She said that I was "breaking them on purpose" and that I wanted her to fix them for free when it  hadn't been a week and by then I had 4 broken nails.<//Review>< userid>

<Review>I went in for a manicure and was directed to chair #4. I noticed she skimmed over my nails haphazardly and did not smooth them after filing. I said nothing. I asked for polish that was red glitter underneath black but the black wasn't used so I asked for a different color and they ladies were upset. I decided to stop and leave and they wanted to charge me $25 no polish no nothing but changed it to $20. I paid and left immediately. This morning while washing my hair my hair kept getting snagged in my fingernails which shows  how poorly the job was done because my nails should be smooth. I'll never go there again. Is there a nail salon to go get a REAL manicure not cold water sloppy filing and shaping where the don't herd you in and out like cattle? I've been to numerous salons over the last 30 years and I haven't found one yet. Where is the quality????????<//Review><rate>1<//rate><name>Cacti One< /name></record></dataset><record>

My first time coming to this nail shop and it was great. I only ended up going here because the other nail salon I went to said I would have had to wait over an hour. However, it was perfect! The prices here are pretty reasonable and the staff are very nice. I will definitely be back! Emoji rating=🙂👍🏽💅🏿<//Review>

<review>I've been getting pedi's here for YEARS. I could go anywhere, but I like it here. I know their faces and they truly are the nicest people and I will always support them and their bussiness. Sure, it's not fancy, it's not the best in town, I'm sure, but their work and kindness is what does it for me. I feel comfortable there and trust them and that's what gets my money and support.< /review>< Pics>

This place opened up on time. The lady that did my pedicure was very friendly. She made me feel comfortable. She did not take long. I also did my eyebrows and the lady did an excellent job for only $8!!!! The prices are very affordable. I will definitely be back.< /text>

I asked for bright sparkles and my nails to be rounder than the photo. My nails are uneven. Crooked and they're not even the same size on each hand. Will never come here again! Super unsanitary, as I was leaving I watched them use the same pumice stone on 2 different customers 🤮🤮🤮<//Text>

I won’t waste my time and money on this place again. I am very unsatisfied. Each time I asked for something to get corrected, it ended up worst. Also don’t like that no gloves are used. I asked for a discount due to I still being unhappy and they declined. I paid $40 for these horrible nails</review>

I took my daughter and her friend to get their nails done and they were not nice to them at all. They didn’t do anything they asked. For example my daughter asked for square nails and they gave her a round shaped. After she asked them to make them more square  the guy told her no that it looked better round. She showed them a picture of what she wanted and they tried to talk her out of what she wanted. Telling her she would like better. She left super upset. The Worst part is her nails chipped the very next day less than 24hrs later. All she did was shower.<//Review><Date>1547336530128<//Date>< username>

No communication with customers at all. They're like little robots programmed to just work period. No how can I help you? What do you need? Or at least a hello please sign up. Nothing!!! The most boring salon ever.
Didn't even get a chance to see their work after waiting for 30 minutes without being asked what I was there for at the LEAST.< /text>

<Review>I am very particular when it comes to a good manicure. Of the four different nail salons I've tried in Bakersfield, this one I liked the best. My manicurist's name was My, and she was very attentive and friendly. I ended up not liking the color I had originally chosen, and she patiently waited for me to chose another. She asked questions here and there to ensure she did what I wanted, and was pleasant conversation when we weren't talking about nails. The whole experience was very pleasant, clean, and affordable.<//Review><response>None</response><Rate>5<//Rate>< pictures>

Very nice people in there that also speak very plain English and enjoy carrying on a conversation with you.  They all do very nice manicures.  I usually get gels done.  Their rates are very reasonable.</Review>

Horrible! The lady was in a rush while doing my fill, she cut me 4 times with the drill! I will never return here. I’ve never gone for a fill at a salon where they didn’t drill my natural nails underneath! This looks HORRIBLE. I was so unhappy with this place<//Text>

Walked in without an appointment and was taken care of right away.  Danny did a fantastic job on my pink and whites! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was a bit dirty.  I will definitely go back.< /Review>

Bad customer service and experience. My mom went in for nails this week April 2019 and they were so bad. They were crooked and thick all the nails were a different size and she still had to pay full price for ugly nails< /Text>

Very disappointing! I called for an appointment and was told just to go in. I did but then realized that the man that was doing my full set was in a hurry to leave. So basically he rushed through the whole thing! He spent more time buffing out my cuticles and not the nails themselves. As a result, EVERY ONE OF MY NAILS, is uneven and lumpy! He turned the fans off (so I had 1 hand partially dried) and then he walked away, literally got in his car and drive away, before I could say anything about the sh*tty work that he just did. Now I'm stuck with this for 2 weeks!! On top of that, he spent most of my visit trying to talk me into a different color, a gel polish, my nail length preference, etc... Look.. I'm not paying for an opinion. I'm paying for my nails to look how I WANT THEM. Instead, they look like a 5 year old got a hold of a DIY gel kit. I will not waste my money here again.< /Text>

Asked for natural looking nails and matte, ended up getting pinkish nails glossy, I dont understand what was so hard about what I had asked for. And to top it off 4/10 of my fingers got cut and bled. They were so quick with the work rushing it all so that they can get over with the customers and go home. NEVER AGAIN!</text>

They are rather expensive. The people aren't very friendly and most of the aesthetic are men. It's very clean. I personally would not go there again but different strokes for different folks.<//Review>

<user_id>114874288284164795725</user_id><Text>So if you need a pedicure everything is great about it except the polish . Was so happy with the service of the pedi till i went home and looked closely at my toes ..it looks smudge  so lets talk about the fullset the price is on the board well dont even bother looking at it bcuz they change the price anyway paid 28 dollar not including tip for just white tip acrylics.  So didnt get his name but a man did my fullset sits in chair 4 and he filed my cuticles with the lil drill . I told him your hurting me im bleeding and he was like u have hang nails like boiii if i have hang nails clip them gently or leave them alone so i can deal with them . Dont file them with the drill. I had to come home and put alcohol on them . He files idk how many other ppls nails and keeps his drill head in an altoids mint container . Hope i dont get anything my fingers hurt and he kept pushing for me to get other services like i dont want that i told him 5x i dont want pink and white . After i showed him i was bleeding he was like oh sorry not even caring . Never going again.</Text>< Rate>

<Text>Nope!! I needed a previous set taken off and just wanted gel. Long story short it was a painful process. If I wanted to rip my nails off and make them bleed and be super tender I would of done that at home and saved me the trip. Needless to say I left mid torture. No thank you.< /Text>< pictures>

A lot of variety from vintage clothes to real plants and incense. If you're visiting definately gotta stop by, every Sunday from 9 am-5. Local artists, lots of plants, yummy food, candles, jewelry.< /review>

<Text>The vendors and actual market is great. The atmosphere and vibe is good, too. It's just super crowded. Parking is a nightmare, so just beware of that.< /Text>< Pictures>

<name>Rod N</name><Text>Newly opened areas for foot tragic flow; gives this place a welcomed new  feel!  Sunday's only 9am 5pm

No parking. Parking lot was full. If you can find one, street parking available.

Admission...$5

The line to get in was long. However, the line moved quickly and we were in!

100 +  friendly vendors offering you the best deal they can.

Live DJ Killing it!
And Various Music playing here and there as you stroll looking for those sleepers (hidden treasure)!

Shady areas to relax/ post.

Delicious Food trucks to fuel you when you get the munchies. And yes, Rest rooms available and clean.

If you enjoy:
A lively atmosphere.
Youthful spirited energy.
Friendly faces. And a barrage of clothing, vintage items, oddities, Art,  etc.

Then I'll see you there!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Great location & variety of vendors. So many great finds, but also some vendors have the audacity to try over-charging for used clothing items that you could buy new today at Macy's for less 😅 do your research & haggle as necessary</text>

<review>Don't go during the pandemic, guys. Bought tickets before realizing how crowded it was. Most people were wearing masks BESIDES THE PERSON WHO CHECKED OUR TICKETS...?! I didn't see any vendors clean any of their merchandise at any point. It seems like a breeding ground. Definitely wait to come until COVID 19 passes.</review>< GmapID>

This is the best flea market that I've ever been to! Sooooo many cool things to get here! You pay 5 bucks to get in, but the prices are pretty reasonable at most stalls. This is a great place for unique clothing and gifts! Love it :)< /review>

<text>Really nice experience. Not a lot of social distancing but definitely encouraged. Mask were worn by mostly everyone. The Thai and Jamaican food trucks offered some great tasting food. I found some vintage and trendy items here. I would suggest prepurchasing a ticket to avoid waiting in line.<//text>< Pics>

Always fun. Although stupid 3 line policy in effect now.  Get it together. Guys behind   me, bought tix online. Stepped over the rope, and got in right away. While others who had paid the cashier still waited to go inside...< /Review>

This is a touch-free option that allows you to skip the cash line and check-in with the pre-paid ticket scanner.

<Review>MTP - As of 3/28- awesome place to shop vintage and high and low brow wares. Must wear a mask to enter and pay for a ticket. Proceeds benefit art programs for the fairfax highschool grounds that the market takes place on. Some vendors will also negotiate the prices. I bought a vintage italian sweater from the 70s for $25 instead of 35. And a Canon 35 mm camera from ' 99 for $60.
Not bad!
They also have many garden and house plants as well as holistic and organic options to clean your home.
But if you're looking for cheap costume jewelry, sun glasses and the perfect distressed tee, this ... Is the spot to be.<//Review>< pics>

Definitely come by, tons of very cool vendors and unique stuff. Absolutely worth visiting if you're looking for some retro goods (clothes, vinyls, postcards). Don't confuse this with a vintage store or thrift market, these are artisans and these goods are not necessarily cheap.</text>

Intriguing. My first time there. I was surprised to see such a counterintuitively large public attraction on the eve of a major regional pandemic shutdown, but everyone I saw was masked properly and socially distanced. Hopefully it will continue to operate during the holiday season, I'd like to return.< /text>

Great choice of vendors! The vibe here was so chill! Found some good stuff. Plants galore! Go early when it's not so damn hot. There are a few food trucks. I got super lucky with the parking but it is a challenge getting down Genesee Ave. Very narrow street.  Looking forward to my next visit.</review>

The place to find unique one-off items. From clothing and accessories to furniture and trinkets. I love wandering around the aisles, getting lost and promising myself not to spend any more money. Hard to do.

They raised entrance fee prices from $3 to $5. Cash is best to have on you for most of these merchants.

Come right when it opens to find the best items. Or if you just want to browse, take your time and get here before they close or else you’ll get a million reminders on the loud speaker about closing in x-amount of minutes.

There’s a cute food court area - all located out doors. Get coffees here, rest your legs and unwind.

I love how people who shop here are wearing amazing, trendy clothes.< /Text>

I love this flea market. It’s there every Sunday and there’s always so much to choose from. I saw Heidi Klum there with her daughter last time I went! Definitely check it out if you’re in the area. There is free valet parking here as well or street parking available. There’s always live music and food trucks here with delicious food!<//Text>

< Review>
Awesome market. only a cupla bucks to enter main gate.Anything and everything type traders. We found treasures! New hand painted shirts through to vintage glass! Held at Fairfax High School grounds on Melrose, only on Sunday, the area this market takes up was very worthwhile taking the time to go and wander through, as it’s extensive. If you’re looking for an ‘Aladdin’s Cave’ treasure hunt market, this is it. Beautiful array of stock, a visual feast, well set up alleyways. Good food available, the restrooms are in the school building, and walkways are asphalt, some shaded, some sunny. also had a beaut little mini golf area kids can use for FREE, using fancy shoes as the bumpers.<//Review>

<review>This is the place to go to in downtown when you don't know exactly what you want to eat or when you're with a lot of people and you can't decide where to eat. This place is packed with flavor from different parts of the world. I was able to see Thai food, Chinese food, Salvadorian food, Mexican food, Italian food, and even vegan food (yes, I know vegan food isn't a part of the world but it deserves recognition as a food category haha). There are also little markets inside that sell produce, meat, spices, and candies. This place has it all!</review>< Pictures>

So many options here. There is something for everyone. You can't go wrong with any store here, even the shop that sells mole. It does get crowded but can't complain about it. That is the nature of Melrose Trading Post. Parking prices are pretty decent for downtown L.A.</text>

This place is massive! It's also a bit of a maze so I would suggest getting a map. Don't come here if you are looking to get valuable items for super cheap prices. This isn't junkers laying stuff on tarps (which I happen to love also). The sellers here know what's for sale and prices are similar to antique stores or Etsy.</Review>

Not as good as it used to be even though it is bigger now. The set up seems to have no rhyme or reason now and not a lot of cool stuff like before. LACC is just as good if not better now and is a lot less to get in to.< /Text>

<UserId.>117082501629010057928<//UserId.><Review>We love the Melrose Trading Post, it opens every Sunday on Fairfax, supporting the local High School.

There are so many vendors filled with creatives who’ve come together to bring you affordable one of a kind pieces from; furniture to antiques, to jewelry, clothes, a shiatsu massage, crystals, vinyl records, dream catchers, plants... etc

There is a lovely square of food trucks and a live band.

Great place to go with friends, family, or with people visiting!</Review>< username>

$5 per person is a bit steep for a flea market, reason for two star. Cute stuff but more of a arts and crafts festival than a swap meet.< /Review>

This place remind me of my home town Tlacolula plaza because there are a lot of different vendors so you can enjoy different kind of foods and flavors. You can also rest under a big tree with a big shade there. The cost for the entry is $5.00 each person. If one day you are there, I hope you search for the girls, Miss Hollywood and help them to help the program "No Kids Go Hungry." They sell water and sodas too.<//Text>< resp>

Ugh.  I only went because my trendy daughter dragged me there.  Typical L.A. flea market littered with used $98 Levi's and the smell of pot wafting through the air.  So not my scene.</review>

What can I say,  I love the Melrose market!!!!  So many awesome vendors: clothes,  accessories,  home goods, plants, art,  vintage,  repurposed,  new,  local,  global, you name it! I've bought handmade jewelry,  rugs,  candles,  homemade beauty products etc.
We also always go to the food area and get crepes and lemonade.  They have so many choices though.  Live music as well.  The best Sunday hangout.  Entry is now $5, I seem to recall. Might want to bring cash, although most vendors do square now.< /Text>

Lots of clothes and art. Not that many who sell antiques and stuff for your home. Not a place to make a bargain or find. Entrance $5.</text>

I could go on and on about this flea market - I have devotedly attended this Sunday tradition for years now and have watched it steadily grow in size, vendors, and popularity.  You can find an eclectic variety of wares here: vintage clothing, artisan and vintage jewelry, houseplants, antiques, local artists, new furniture from local craftsmen, food for all tastes and diets, knick-knacks galore, and even more items in between. Most vendors inside accept cash and cards, but be prepared for the cash-only entrance fee of $5. You’re guaranteed to find something you didn’t know you wanted every time you go.<//Text>

<text>Very nice flea market. There is a great variety of goods on sale and you will be surprised by what you will find. Even if you dont buy anything just looking at all the wares is fun and worth the $5 dollar entrance fee.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2beccfa5466f5:0x5f3fd735a7af1c9e< /Gmap_id><rating>5< /rating>< UserId.>

Lots of clothes and art. Not that many who sell antiques and stuff for your home. Not a place to make a bargain or find. Entrance $5.< /review>

<Text>This is a relatively fun, but small flea. It carries a $5 entry, but once you're in you're greeted with mostly vintage clothes, a few succulents and/or house plants vendors, some vintage print places, local Jewelers, vintage furniture, and a pretty great coffee place. It's more of a quirky outdoor home decor shop with a cover fee, but it does have its gems. Go here for clothing, or home decor. Don't come here for bargain hunting and lots of treasure hunting.</Text>< pics>

< review>
This is a relatively fun, but small flea. It carries a $5 entry, but once you're in you're greeted with mostly vintage clothes, a few succulents and/or house plants vendors, some vintage print places, local Jewelers, vintage furniture, and a pretty great coffee place. It's more of a quirky outdoor home decor shop with a cover fee, but it does have its gems. Go here for clothing, or home decor. Don't come here for bargain hunting and lots of treasure hunting.</review>

First time here. It's awesome! Traffic is bad and parking is worse. And there was a line to get in. But that's all expected so if you aren't up for that, you chose the wrong place. Inside though, there are great vendors. Everyone was very friendly and tasty food stuffs!
Here's a photo of something that made me smile.<//Review>

I love hunting for treasures here. It gets pretty packed with “trendy” people who mostly shop for vintage clothes, which works great for me because it keeps the crowds concentrated at the clothing booths while I look for home decor. You’re able to find anything from antique pieces to modern handmade crafts. Most of the vendors are the same every week, but some change out and you’re able to find new things every time.</text>

It's cash only, but if you don't have cash there is an ATM right by the entrance. Inside there are a lot of vintage items & stores that sell sunglasses, clothes, furniture, accessories, candles, food, & just some random items. Reminds me of an upscale outdoor swapmeet. It's only on Sunday's and it's just a fun spot to walk around! You may find a treasure or two!<//Text>< Pictures>

You get your food like cafeteria style but it's so good and you can ask for small alterations in your order without the price going up. For example I wanted less noodles and more meat sauce.

Had a good time walking around and looking at all the cool, vintage clothing/shoes/ jewelry and kitschy decor . Definitely have to visit the corn booth. The baked potatoes are at the same booth and are really tasty. Live music brings it all together.< /Review>

This has to be one of the most trendiest flea market I have ever been to. They so much great and unique vendors. I was finally able to find the perfect camo jacket Ive been looking for, for lower than store price. The boyfriend and I got some healing gem stones for 2 for $15 and so on. I def would recommend!</Text>< Pictures>

If you check the website, there's usually a coupon for $1 off entry.

Early bird def gets the worm here.  If you arrive early there's parking, but if you are like most of LA you aren't gonna get any parking, good luck with that!

As my friend says, it's like an outdoor goodwill, so you don't get the musty smells.  Are you spending an arm and leg on stuff you can get for a few dollars at Goodwill?  Probably!  But the goods are always unique and there are also almost always celebrities if that's your thing.

There is always awesome music in the food area.  And the food isn't bad either!  The guy in the corner doing corn bowls is awesome with delicious kombucha on tap.  Other notable eateries include the crepe place and there are always samples of fries.< /Review>

Not exactly my style per say... very vintage.
The music, food and drinks were great ! Very nice set up too. The plants (for purchase) were BEAUTIFUL. Extremely hot inside here though because of all the tents. Also, I think the entrance fee of $5 was a little silly.</text>

I luv this smallish swap..The vendors are very nice for the most  part...Another reason I come is the CVT soft serve truck by the entrance. Jammin' soft serve.

Then I drive down the Street to Little Johns toffee @Farmers Market...the Carmel apples r to die for.</text>

This flea market never gets old. I love spending my Sundays here. The food is great and sitting and listening to the music is nice. Always something to purchase and prices are better now then when I used to go a couple years back. I would say you can clear about 2-3 hours of the day here. Even though it’s $5 now I still think it’s a good deal. They do have $1 coupons online so check it out. Also, you may bump into your favorite celebrity or musician because there always some wondering around.< /Text>

<text>First time here. It's awesome! Traffic is bad and parking is worse. And there was a line to get in. But that's all expected so if you aren't up for that, you chose the wrong place. Inside though, there are great vendors. Everyone was very friendly and tasty food stuffs!
Here's a photo of something that made me smile.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBSTY3dcp7lDes1T-1XtHWmZoCYZORXUPuUoBF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

<Review>The Melrose Trading Post is a weekly (Sundays) flea market type of outing, and it features many eclectic and trendy artisan and collectibles-type of vendors. I went here for the fragrances by RxCandles, a great producer of fine scents for personal and home use in aromatherapy.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2beccfa5466f5:0x5f3fd735a7af1c9e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>5 dollars to get in. Some booths are, to be honest, just people looking to get rid of junk they found at a thrift store. Some people sell vintage clothes (also probably thrifted) that could probably be cool but they’re a little hard to look through. The cooler vendors in my opinion were the ones selling handmade and refurbished furniture, some sold handmade jewelry, and the plant vendors were fairly priced. A good way to spend a Sunday afternoon.</review>< pics>

This place is a complete dive.  You can get everything there cheaper elsewhere.  If you buy there you're getting ripped. Super bored, disengaged unfriendly people.  $5 just to get in and look.  $5 just to look!? Zero atmosphere. Went to The Grove right after - it's free to look, straight away you're 5 bucks up.  It's also absolutely beautiful, not a grim dust ball; far better experience, product and prices.  Many other better things to do than get scammed at this dive market.<//Text>

<Review>Fun, and I thought there was a lot of variety in vendors. Vintage clothes intermingled with artist Renditions of old and new ideas. I found some great antique jewelry reasonably priced. A few seamstresses out there making some unique athletic wear as well as club attire. There is a cover charge to get in... I think it is worth it as I'm sure it decreases the vendors lease fee and not everybody sells what they'd like.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

This is a great "flea" market.  There are some that are mostly trash, but not this one.  It is well known and has great vendors of used, new and a mix of both.  Really good food vendors too.  Have only been a couple of times, but had good shoping experiences.  Have also had good breakfast burritos and even good live music.  Not only is it a shopping experience, but full family entertainment too.  Will always,go out of our way to check it out whenever in town.<//review>

This place is great! I love that the admission fee goes to a local high school's programs. The street market itself has a wonderful variety of handmade jewelry and products from local vendors, and folks selling vintage/used items. A great spot to find unique gifts or just to spend an afternoon (plan on taking some time to get through it all).< /review>

Massive flea market with lots of artisan creations to choose from. Last time there I bought an India-made beaded sheer fabric necklace (yup, that's right) and a very cool looking hip holster purse made from recycled tire rubber.< /Review>

<Text>This little alley is suuuuuuuuuper cool. You want some odds and ends that can't be found other places (this is it) Such a good stop.

Music
Vintage Gear
Food trucks
Art
Shoes and more

This is what you expect in this part of town. Just a cool little stop for any age.< /Text>< Response>

Not a bad place at all. Extremely vintage, but definitely some gems in there. $5 entrance is definitely worth it, especially to support an endeavor from students. 8/10 would deff go back<//Text>

Its a street market showcasing local artistry and people's vintage finds. What other would call junk could also be another person's treasure. No shortage of old clothes and ornaments. There's a vendor there that has a whole department store section for aloha shirts for 7.00. Great fit for summer or for a gift for your trendy teen. It's bigger than you think so take the time to explore. Also, say hi to all the dogs you'll see. Came around 1:20, didn't find parking until 2:00 so I suggest coming early. There's also a mini street market across the street. It's a great Instagram photo spot due to the fact that there's an angel wing mural at the entrance of it. Great place to visit for 2 or so hours.</review>

Rock 'n Roll heaven. The $3 admission goes entirely to arts education at Fairfax High. Art is the Heart of civilization. Great food, great finds, tons of fun. a curated vintage, up cycled, recycled and hand made goods post. Multiple music options throughout, bathrooms, trash cans, valet parking, website. Open ever Sunday...your spirit will be moved.< /text>

Of the flea market offerings in LA, this is a big one.  However, the dominant item is clothes, clothes, clothes.  If you are looking for curated/vintage home goods or local artists, artisans, etc, this swap meet does have some, but they are few in number compared to the clothing offerings.  It's mainly a younger crowd, so whatever used-clothing trend is happening at the moment for that audience, you'll find a lot of here.< /Review>

A fun place to spend an afternoon, but less useful for making purchases. From my perspective, the household goods weren't very varied, well-priced or high quality, but may just not be my style. Great people watching and food trucks though and admission is only $3 per person. I'd really like to give this spot 3.5 stars.

Also, uncomfortable restroom experience - guests can use bathrooms in the high-school, but the doors are so low that people standing in line waiting for the rest rooms can see you over your stall. Not sure how this isn't a problem for high-school students...< /Text>

Love this outdoor flea market. Great unique finds!
However, lately I’ve noticed the vendor’s prices increasing and merchandise is becoming a little too expensive which completely contradicts that of an  traditional flea market or swap meet.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2beccfa5466f5:0x5f3fd735a7af1c9e<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great place, but not worth 5 dollar admission, it should be free.I paid more for admission then what I came out with.$20 total just for admission to walk out  with a $10 shirt and 1 plant that was $3 dollars.</Review>

This is the coolest market I've seen! Flee Market, maybe, but more like artisan trading post!
Obviously there's a ton of clothes, but you can find art, accessories, gadgets, and even games!

This is a must-see I'm Los Angeles!</Text>

Ah I've been here so many times I can never get bored of this place. There is so much to see and so much to do. Plan to spend a good 3 hours walking around checking everything out. I love the coffee at the food truck in the middle of the market. Remember to bring cash for the door to get in.<//review>

I see this as an over rated market. Clothes, furniture and food - all were below average. The only good thing is to enjoy the music and songs played by the musicians. Also, few plant shops are wonderful. Also, the entrance fee varies depending upon your arrival time.< /Review>

<Review>After arriving in 1997 & moving into the neighborhood it became one of my regular weekend destinations . Super cool then as now! A Melrose tradition! I love the early morning crush to get in... vendors & patrons. My most fond memories of the flea market are attending with all of my old friends. Remembering 20 years of sleepy mornings rolling down to the post. #oldschool #vintagestuff #ravers Thank You.< /Review><user_name>Krysta Abesamis< /user_name>< Response>

<Text>It was a first visit for me. Lots of cool stuff, though a bit expensive (I think) for old, raggedy, stained vintage clothing. The atmosphere was chill I enjoyed the whole scene.</Text>< userid>

You have to come here! First off, the $3 admission ticket goes to the high school to help pay for programs that get cut (arts, physical fitness, etc). And then plan to stay AT LEAST four hours here. It’s amazing. So many different type of booths from grunge and cheap to chic and pricey. I stumbled upon this going up Melrose on a Sunday and I’m so glad I did! One of my favorite activities during my trip to LA.< /Review>

NOT a flea market! But perfectly nice. Definitely too pricey 2nd hand stuff and fancy new stuff.  Pleasant to wander around though and nice food stalls.<//Text>

The hot spot for LA’s urban dwellers every Sunday, Fairfax High School parking lot is filled to the max of hipsters and kiosks ready to upscale your wardrobe or you interior decorating. Entry fee is under $5 and you can literally spend a whole day here checking out the shops, some live music and a delicious snow cone. Every trip to the Flea Market I walk away with new hand crafted jewelry or a groovy pair of sunglasses. Do yourself a favor and brave the parking to come wander around the asphalt, it will not disappoint.</Review>

Big flea market, Melrose = pricey but there are lots of vendors packed full of one of a kind goodies for you to take home and wow your friends and family. Lots of shopping in walkable distance so plan to make a day of it.<//Text>

It was warmer than I expected. The booth I was looking for had moved and I could not find them! I was a little frustrated. However, I did find some really great bargains!</Review>

Had a lot of cool vendors and you’re bound to find something, but can get crowded if you come late. Come early and take your time browsing everything!< /Text>

This place is crazy, no offense, but when you hear that assume an offensive comment follows. It's a giant thrift store outdoors, most of it and I mean most, is used clothing. So if your into the whole BoHo seen, head right over.< /text>

Parking is a nightmare but there’s some cool stuff here. I’m not the fashionista / retro hipster female consumer they’re after but it was cool to walk around for an hour or two. Worth a Sunday afternoon!<//Review>

Get there early before the crowds. Very trendy and fun. If you're looking for "deals" you can probably find cheaper (but you'll have to work harder for them).<//Review>

Not a good flea market basically a place for hipsters to come meet for coffee on the weekend not a good place to find anything really cool vintage wise don't recommend it go to the Pasadena City College one that's much better<//review>

The lady at the front taking "mandatory donations" is extremely rude! Also most items at this "flee market" are extremely over priced...you can buy brand new at regular retail stores for cheaper or same prices.< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Admission fee $ 5 / Stamp your back
Food truck meals, small shows, clothes, flower pots, accessories, antiques, furniture, shoes, photos, picture frames, cameras, and candles.
From looking good new products to garbage
From something you want to be a little expensive to selling at a reasonable price
There are many kinds of things, so it's fun to watch them and the time goes by quite a bit, but I personally have nothing to buy ^^;

입장료 5불 / 손등에 도장찍어주고 입장
푸드트럭같은 식사, 작은 공연, 옷, 화분, 악세서리, 골동품, 가구, 신발, 사진, 액자, 카메라, 캔들 정말 다양한 종류를 한 데서 팔고 있었습니다.
괜찮아보이는 새제품부터 쓰레기가 아닌가 싶은 것까지
조금 비싸다 싶은 것부터 꽤 저렴하게 파는것까지
여러 종류의 것들이 있다보니 구경만해도 재미도 있고 시간이 꽤 금방 지나갑니다만 개인적으로 전딱히살건없더라고요^^;< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO9CHEgcgLns8Zy6LkHxooD5Fu-eSReINOpcnF2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPw6GcGEM2sRiYmwsC0g9nkYHyx6Xsl56ROt1KY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvil352mD7IShtvo8anzXGw5Ei6TBNL6cQJd47=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGfcDctGhshTRP4hp5wzSpux2jJZXlb0KexF7e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1ZYYy5RoRmzzIGAndQNTPwchlWiVqXTpBAF_h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< gmapID>

<review>(Translated by Google) One of the best popular markets in Los Angeles and worth a visit, the prices are very reasonable and the merchandise is very unique and there is music on stage in the food side. Overall the place is worth a try.

It opens only on Sunday, the entrance fee to the place is $ 5. Most places require cash to pay, but there are withdrawal machines with an additional fee.

(Original)
من أفضل الأسواق الشعبية في لوس أنجلس و يستحق الزيارة، الأسعار مناسبة جدا و البضاعة جدا فريدة و يوجد موسيقى على المسرح في جهة المأكولات. بشكل عام المكان يستحق التجربة.

يفتح فقط يوم الأحد، رسوم الدخول الى المكان ب٥ دولار. أغلب الأماكن تتطلب كاش للدفع، و لكن تتواجد مكاين سحب مع رسوم إضافية.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwDLjVodX-wt7hiCE_vvFrtLtdJmWVCjXFGidc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-gHcCTFESE9vdCN0qTEMQZTwkEhTRmYivgryW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMI9E9Nja1sTbSHLGX_O7KVLuO17W29FW9IDXKG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2beccfa5466f5:0x5f3fd735a7af1c9e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) A large flea market held every weekend at high school.
It costs $ 5 per person to enter.
It can be purchased for less than half the price of used clothing stores in Japan.
They also sold miscellaneous goods, accessories, antiques, used clothes and furniture.
There are many stylish people so you can enjoy just entering.

You can enjoy a variety of food trucks and live performances.

<review>(Translated by Google) The Flea market is located in Fairfax High School, on Elle's famous Mallory Street. Admission is $ 5, free valet parking. It's always crowded with young people and tourists living near Hollywood. If you come to Los Angeles, the center of world entertainment, I recommend you to stop by.

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is a nice antique fair, there are also some artisan exhibitors. Approx 200 stalls there are also food shops and when I went there was a girl singing live with her guitar. It is done every Sunday and admission is $ 2. I parked one block away on the street at no charge. You can haggle or ask for a better price. There are very nice articles. Worth a visit.

Es una linda feria de antigüedades, también hay algunos expositores artesanales. Aprox 200 puestos también hay negocios de comidas y cuando yo fui había una chica cantando en vivo con su guitarra.

Also When you visit this place do not forget to take a little tour of the food stalls. Many choices and everything tasty, especially the Mexican food from Alberto I love when I go I do not hesitate to stop by for some tamales or a dish that they prepare. Delicious.

(Translated by Google) There was a lot to see, but it was too hot.. The admission fee also rose to 5 dollars. It is worth going at least once.

볼건 많은데 너무더웠어요..입장료도 5달러로 올랐더라구요. 한번쯤 가볼만합니다.</Review>
