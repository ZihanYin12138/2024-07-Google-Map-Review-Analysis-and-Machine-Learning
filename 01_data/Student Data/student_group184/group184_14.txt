< Review>
Went in for a light inspection.  Was told a list of items that needed to be fixed( pretty much all of my lights) they quoted me a price. I did the work myself (replaced everything they suggested,  grill and ALL  lights front and rear) went in for re-inspection  and they failed it because they said the grill was loose.  I asked them to show me the problem  and they couldn't,  . Pooor customer service and shaddy practices! Terrible place to take your car!<//Review>

My tech would have needed to "tear down and inspect"  to see what was causing the grill to not properly secure. (you did not want to move forward).  Could be broken items where it should be been secured.  I am sorry you were not satisfied with our information. We have to follow the CA State Lamp Inspection procedures. I hope you find a shop you will like in the future.'}< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Thank you so much  taking care of my mom and the issues with her car. My mom being elderly and not living close to family is always a target. When she took her care to you for an issue with a Joe not only were you professional but you explained it to her in a way she understood. When she told me about her experience she started crying and said she felt respected and that she mattered. Thank you you are an amazing company and I hope nothing but success for you. Everyone should be taling their vehicles to you!!!!< /review>

I called Automotive Mediocrity for three things, one of which was a broken air conditioner. They couldn't get me in for a couple of weeks - which is fine - and I decided to wait it out in spite of the 110 degree heat wave. The morning of September 1st finally came and I brought it in to get it fixed. They said they needed a couple of hours to run diagnostics and then would call me with an estimate. They didn't call until after hours, which is also fine. I learned that they had additional diagnostics that they needed to do which would take about an hour and would I like to schedule that for September 10th - 10 days later- their next available spot, after which they would know what was wrong and could then schedule work to be done.

Wait, what? I brought my car in to get it fixed, not schedule more diagnostics for 10 days out only then to be able to schedule it to be fixed?
The guy who I spoke with treated me like I was nuts to expect that when I bring my car in to get it fixed it was... wait for it... to get it fixed. I felt like I was getting gaslighted.

I found a different mechanic pretty quickly and told Automotive Malignant that I was coming to get my car. They indicated that they needed to put the front bumper and other parts back on, first, because they had to remove them for diagnostics. Fine. After paying $260 I drove my car from Automotive Inimical to the new mechanic and the front right side of the car sounded like it was dragging and about to fall off. I was scared to death. I don't know if they intentionally or negligently did not put the car back together correctly but either are equally awful. When I got to the mechanic he verified it wasn't secured properly (at all?) and recommended I take it back to have it done at no charge but I said I would rather pay than have that guy gaslight me again and treat my like I was nuts to think there was anything wrong.</review>

Frank was super helpful. We had our engine light on and Frank read the code and recommended a new gas cap. Problem solved. Definitely, if we had a serious problem we would’ve left our car here for repair.< /review>

<Review>Went in for a brake and light inspection for my project car, on the recommendation of a friend who had done the same thing.  Couldn't have gone more smoothly.  Very professional, friendly staff, and a thorough run-through for the testing process (had the car for several hours).

I would recommend this shop to others.< /Review><rating>5< /rating><username>Mark Keuning</username>< response>

< Review>
I was GREATLY APPRECIATIVE! We were cared for on the highway as two AAA Road Service men teamed up to care for my wife and I, keep us safe, and tow both our truck and trailer to an OUTSTANDING Service Center - AUTOMOTIVE EXCELLENCE REPAIR in Placerville. Owner ROSS MITCHELSON continued the excellent care by going over and beyond the call of duty, by fitting us into his schedule at the end of the day, repairing the problem and getting us on our way home. THANK YOU!

AUTOMOTIVE EXCELLENCE REPAIR TAKES IT’S NAME VERY SERIOUSLY!  “THEY” ARE SYNONYM FOR INTEGRITY, CARE, EXPERTISE, SERVICE, FAIRNESS,  AND “COMMUNITY,” WHETHER YOU ARE A LOCAL OR A TRAVELER.< /Review>

<review>Jake at the front desk sets this place apart for me. He is friendly and knowledgable. He stayed late so I could pick my car up after work. When I arrived I found the price was $180 less than the estimate. I was told it did not take them as long to install my belts and they only charged me for the time it took. I found the honesty and customer service in the shop to be above and beyond.< /review>< response>

<Text>They are all very friendly, They did a lot more then just a oil change when that's all I took it in for, They even rotated my tires which was included in the price. They gave me a coupon price even know I didn't have a coupon. The owner Randi even came out and chatted with me since I was the only one in the lobby at the time and offered my water. That is great customer service. They also showed me samples of all my fluids to show if I needed anything and everything looked great. I will recommend them for sure to my friends and family

Automotive Excellence is all that needs to be said about this repair shop. Every time I have done business with A. E. they have always gone the extra mile to get the job done.

<review>Had my ac and water pump, fan serviced/replaced, $3k job.
Got it back on time but a VERY audible noise inside that was only present when the AC was operating.
Took it back, they found a bad clutch on my fan, replaced the clutch. Got it back same problem. Took it back was told whole AC job needed to be redone. Metal was found in the system, bad compressor.
Got the it back and found the noise still present. Took it back, was told the AC lines were making contact with the body or firewall. Got it back noise is still there but as loud. I've had this truck for 140K miles never made this noise before. Even after the previous AC service. I question how long this will last...
Also why did I have to point out the noise each time? Anyone with ears could and can still hear it.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Randy and the whole  staff are always so helpful.  I have taken my BMW here for years.  I went in just today for a smog check,  which I had failed the previous day at a different place(jacks place in jackson) over something that the smog tech should have done his job and would had seen that it was all up to code(im talking about a K&N air filter that didn't have the manufactures sticker on it). Anyways because the tech at automotive excellence knows  what the heck he's doing.... Did his research and I walked out with my smog certificate. And because I had smoged  it there before I was outta there in less then a half an hour.
Recommend this place to anyone.< /Review>

First, I have to plan my Saturdays accordingly with all the errands and tasks I can't get done during the normal work week.  Working M-F and being gone from 6am to 7pm doesn't leave much time to do anything.
On Saturday, April 8th, they closed early.  No message.  No note.  Nothing.
I called and talked to someone who apologized and verified they were supposed to be open. I made an appointment for 10:30 am for today, 4/15.
Today, I arrived a few minutes early to find out I didn't have an appointment.  My name wasn't on their board.  I was asked to come back again after 2pm.   Really?  To get screwed over again?  This was my first and second attempt to do business with them.  There will not be a third.< /text>

Highly suggest not going here! Im a fan of getting a business a chance to correct itself but these people have no clue on making customers happy and didnt try.

So, per a friends recommendation I went in there at 10am yesterday for a smog check. Price was reasonable, job got done and at the time I thought everything was A ok. So I decided I would come back that afternoon and get an oil change . Thing is I would found out later that the first job they didnt do correct.

Funny thing is I met with a client told them I had to hurry our appointment as I was going there after to get an oil change. He was a good guy and seemed to know the area and advised me not to go there. He told me the place was known for upsales on everyone that comes in. Well I didnt take his advice and went in anyways to my appointment at 4pm.

Got there at 15 minutes to 4pm they advised me that my car would be ready in 45 minutes to an hour tops.

One hour later....still waiting in loby. I go the counter service man advices me they are pulling it now.

One hour and 15 minutes later....still not done. The owner sees me frustrated and comes up to me and says she will check it out, I tell her I need to go to a dinner date.

Owner comes back and has a tray says my fuilds are dirty, coolant, rear diff fluid, transmission fluid and more. Thus upselling begins find out later that they do this to mostly everyone. She then mentiones other problems I inform her again I need to get going.

Finally almost wo hours later my car is outside. I immediately notice oil smear marks on the side of my car, and when I open the door notice oil on the seat on the door hinge snd more! I start trying to clean when the guy that did the oil change comes out and aplogized saying his hands where dirty and he was rushed. Well it was so bad I went in tor a towel inside to clean up.

Owner asks me whats wrong I inform her of the oil mess and that I wasnt happy with time issue. She immediately goes on the defensive tells me now one of my lug nuts was to blame as it took extra time to take off. She then tells me im a liar basically by saying she saw the guys hands and watched him wash his hands. However, she did not know that moments earlier he had apologized for it and admitted to it. So I tell her finally your guy came out and admitted to it and aplogized . She then says says how sorry she is and that if he is doing this she would fire him. She hands me a wet paper towel and helps me clean up the mess. No other offer for this horrible service was given and I had to help clean up a mess that should have never happened.

So....I finally drive away hoping this is the only set of problems hopefully. I get on the road and notice im now on empty!!! I pull over to get gas and notice my locked gas cap cover is not on and is actually on its side where the hole is. Well I know I wasnt on empty before I got there and I have ocd about my gas cap. So I drive back the shop and talk to another man which may had been the other owner.  I tell him im not accusing him specifically but I know I didnt do the gas cap and that it wasn't on empty before I got there, he tells me he watched them do it and nothing fradulent was done. I was nice and said was there any reason they may have unlocked my gas cap he said no. I then asked being lifted is it possible because its a truck that it showed less gas then there was?

He stated no way possible.  I told him I was upset and would leave a review. When talking to a friend they told me most likely that when they did the smog earlier that day on the first job they opened the gas cap and then ignored putting it back on right. So thats a possible senciero.

Either way, a two hour oil change, oil all over the car and seat, the extreme upselling,  and gas cap and mystery gas disappearance im beyond dissatisfied.  I highly recommend choosing and reading reviews before going here. Appears im not the only one with problems here. This is also the longest review ive left on here thus expressing my frustration .<//text>

{'time': 1532449623533, 'text': 'Dear Dana. We do appreciate your feedback, however I think there may be some confusion. It appears you had asked us for an estimate on a State Brake & Lamp Inspection. As it is a boat trailer, it requires additional labor time (compared to a standard vehicle) for the inspection, as we have to comply with state guidelines. The quote also included the Lamp inspection. (not sure if you already had that done as well). I find it interesting as you say you had it done already for $90. We just spoke to you less than 90 minutes ago. The  inspection would take at around 90 minutes if this is a true State Brake inspection done by a certified shop.  If you have any further info that I may not be understanding, I would appreciate it if you could please give me a call.\nSincerely,\nRandi\nOwner- Automotive Excellence'}< /resp>

<review>I have been going to Carl's Jr. since 1960, because for me they're the best fast food burger.  The one l had today at the intersection of El Toro and Moulton was terrible.  It started with the cashier screwing up my request for extra pickles.  I was watching while it was being made and noticed the order said 'no pickles, extra onion'.  I caught the girl who was preparing it and told her the right special request.  The first bite was terrible and it only got worse.  I was going to work so l didn't have time to take it back.  It was so bad l could only stand to eat half of it.  I had to rate this post before they would accept it.  I say minus 2 stars!!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I've been eating here for a long time and I always notice how dirty this place is especially the bathroom. I saw this while I was eating. That was the last time I'm going eat there. Imagine this bug gets in your food ( this table is just next to the kitchen)<//Text>

<Review>I come to this restaurant because, I get a special version of the Famous Star. They have done it right EVERY TIME! BTW, I get a Famous Star with, no Special Sauce and; no mayonnaise. Instead, I get it with Santa Fe sauce. DELICIOUS!<//Review>< pics>

The food is delicious, but the prices are high and the speed of service (at least at this location) is slow.</text>

<Text>They need help. No napkins, bathrooms are dirty and toleit paper. The Mayor was in the parking lot yelling at people and throwing garbage at cars driving by. ( Not kidding) Not going back to this location.  Lake Forest needs to do something about their " Mayor".< /Text></record>

The manager was sucks there. I got a medium strawberry and Limon drink she put more ice than juice. I ask her to take pour some ice out and to put more juice she said do it yourself.  Im like lady do your job. That's not my job and she gave me attitude.</review>

<review>Burger was cold and soggy and looked like it was thrown together by a 2 year old.  Will never eat it again ever. Probably one of the worst tasting burgers I have ever had. Ended up

Do not order a salad at this location. It looks like someone made a BBQ chicken sandwich, removed the bun and placed it over a bow of iceberg lettuce.
No drive through at this location.</Text>

Liam is an amazing host and very knowledgeable about the wines and their history. We did a barrel reserve tasting with him and it was hands down the best I've ever had. Well done. Their wines are amazing. It's a must.</text>

The owner, Dominic, hosted our wine tasting and he and his family/staff were a real pleasure. Their wines are very flavorful, even turning a sweet wine only drinker into a chardonnay purchaser. I'm now a club member and look forward to introducing more of my family and friends to their establishment.</review>< pics>

<Text>Very friendly staff and beautiful grounds!  The tasting room is small, yet cozy.  Easy to get to and they're open until 6pm!  Tasting of their current four wines cost $20, unless you purchase a significant amount of bottles.  Bottle prices averaged just under $50.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMPJw9qDVHBl3d3K29KPKZcdxig05zgy4cKnGDX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjJNTMTYhsl26-UQ09zrpgl68Fp_dzCl7G1nLh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTSH2_A7QS_g5h8O-e20Uer81Kzvxadu8LLc6G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP8oxQTfPzf6DaPj5mDQcUwaeKGKhhWfkhKwGE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJUq4fffVlA0xNj-KKZ3PYTN4JZLrHG7V-vcuB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9K8CwmoI-59SnA7q63NjhekE7ht4lxr1NLHMh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcY9GN4__xnpbMxERupWkktRvwpbkyZq1dbfWz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxnBKgtqL1sDVBwBbMvxTLFjmaD5BVapzg7Gg5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPzW3ml-xPp4IWhwmRQSn37_QiBUnq7kHLG0Oix=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPULHBjWCkExPvn0xWxw0KzIYR7Sm7edyBSXW6P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkz8ipeeej62I36zXT2d1oFTP9jAdomA9LjrCx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808416f67192355f:0xc33e8f384e7613e2< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We did the Ultimate Tasting Experience and had a great time with Liam (one of the owners). The wines were great, and they had brie, crackers, and prosciutto to go alongside everything. It was fun to try so many wines from the barrel (they offer "futures" to purchase some wines in advance of their production, which we did not do). There were great views of the vineyards around the area, and we got to say hi to the vineyard dog, Carolina, which was a plus!< /text>

We had Madison for a legacy tasting and we can't speaking highly enough. The property is beautiful and the wine club has so many perks that we just had to sign up immediately. The wines are really complex and well rounded, we took 2 cases home.</Text>

<review>Came here with some friends after running the Cloverdale half marathon, boy is it a beautiful property.  The parking situation is a bit strange, they don't have any designated spaces except on handicap space.  So you either have to park along side the driveway or do what most people do and back in between the vines.  The tasting experience here was very pleasant, thankfully our friends are club members so we were able to relax down by the pool.
The staff made it feel more like a hangout than a proper tasting which was really nice.  We were able to just take our time and enjoy the wine, the property, and the company.  The wines were all pretty enjoyable, but were a bit too light for my taste.  We didn't end up purchasing any bottles this time, but would consider buying some in the future.  One of the strangest things to me was that to join the wine club didn't offer any discounts on the wine.  It was more like they are trying to sell a membership to their property instead of focusing on the wine.  Definitely would be worth joining if you are a local, or within an hour or so.  But, for someone like me who enjoys buying and aging wine it didn't seem like a good sell.<//review><user_name>Nathan Delaney<//user_name>< gmap_id>

We learned more about wine making than we ever could learn in a book in such a short time.  The view of the fields from the house is amazing for the 6 of us.<//review><gmapID>0x808416f67192355f:0xc33e8f384e7613e2</gmapID>< Pictures>

We discovered this winery several years ago and they are WONDERFUL. We held a birthday party there, full with extended picnic on their patio, guitar-playing and swimming in their pool. Hard to find a more friendly, laid back place with such great wine!<//review>

Wines are good, petite syrah port was really good, but a bit expensive for half-sized bottle!<//Text>

<review>Fantastic wine, I loved the pinot (and I don't normally drink a Syrah) but the old vine Syrah was the best I'd ever tasted.  Beautiful location, we sat on the deck by the pool drinking wine and watched the sun go down over the rolling, misted vineyards of California.  Wonderful experience, hope to be back soon.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

RIP Christopher Creek as we knew it. We came here years ago when CC was still under the original ownership. Back then we were absolutely impressed by the personable service, the friendly low key atmosphere and the Cab. Well, several years later although the buildings are the same, the wine and atmosphere is not. Although the guys working the tasting room were friendly and the wine was okay, we were underwhelmed and the prices are ridiculous. We met one of the new owners, who had quite a snobbish air about him. They seem to be all about pushing membership and catering towards the members only. We left there feeling disappointed, like this winery has turned into a money grab more typical of the Napa wineries. They were out of the Cab, too.< /text>

Really good collection of red wines with pinot noir n blends.. meritageand petit Duran port was perfect .. estate tasting was 25, legacy tasting with reserve n barrel wines was 40.. the petit syrah is only for club members.. n they have a pool, Jacuzzi, and grill.. pretty unique for a winery.. check it out..< /review>

Unauthorized charge on my credit card for $744, I am not a member of their wine club, nor was I in California to purchase any wine. I live 2000 miles away.</Text>

Not only do they have the freshest donuts but they are so festive and have fun themes for each holiday! I stopped in this morning to pick up Halloween donuts for a party I am attending and I know they will be a huge hit! Donut Star is the Best! I highly recommend stopping in if you're in the mood for the best donuts in town!!!</review>

They guys are the Best!  The Donuts. Smoothies, Ham & Cheese Croissants are to die for.  Once you've tried their food, you'll be back!  Oh, and by the way, they keep that place very clean and the servers their care about us little guys!< /review>

<Review>I love this place! The girls that run the place are quirky and fun. They have this thing called a cronut... It is wonderful! It's basically a fried croissant donut!

<text>Donut Star is fantastic!!!  Great price, delicious donuts, great service, fast, polite, and helpful!  I am definitely going to go back and try their fancier donuts, but their regular glazed donuts are so light and fluffy, I can't resist them!  60 students agreed with me, they are the best!</text></record>

Thank you Windy 👌 for the great advise and super delicious freshly made 🍩. Me and my friends we keep appreciating for accommodating us to come inside after you have closed. Your donuts were super fresh and the taste was to the point. I was also surprised to see your place super clean and shining star 🌟 which made me more satisfied with my order. We will definitely come back as we all friends live in the area. You and your sister both are really sweet people to talk with.
Thanks 😘<//Text>

Not only does Donut Star have great donuts, they are community-oriented and a friend to Olive Elementary School. We were in need of  donuts to sell at our annual Science Night to raise money for our Outdoor Ed program, and Donut Star came through for us with delicious donuts at a great price. We could not be happier with our experience and thank Wendy so much for working with us. What an awesome donut shop!<//text>

Their New Fruity Pebbles, Fruit Loops & Cocoa Pebbles Topped donuts are like a flash back for my taste buds. Great morning donuts. Make sure you stop by to see whatever they create next. Highly recommend.< /Text>

Always a great selection of great donuts to choose from.   Great service.   We moved out off state over 10 years ago and the owners remember us every time we come back to visit.   This is always a "must" stop when we are back iin California.</Review>

I am wondering why they're getting more than 4 stars. The reason is because they are cheap I guess.

Eh...we came here after several beers at Bottle Logic and just wanted something sweet. Their donuts were fine, but they also offered bubble tea and that was mediocre at best unfortunately. I would suggest a new recipe for that particular item.< /Text>

<rate>2< /rate><Review>Be careful with the expired milk.  Two days ago I bought a milk that didn't have an expiration date, strange, but still opened it and sure enough it was bad.  So today I purchased another one and it also didnt have an expiration date so I asked for one that did.....the milk had expired 5 days ago.  The cashier (owner, I think) got upset that I didnt want expired milk - wow!  I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY ARE RUBBING THE EXPIRATION DATE THEMSELVES.

But they do have good donut holes.< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Honestly guys, I don't like writing bad reviews but this place is pretty bad. My rating is a 1/2 star or less.

The staff seemed nice... unfortunately the donuts are very old. I'm guessing they were probably getting slow, so they started keeping unsold donuts and stuff for an extra day. Sad thing is, this is not going to keep customers or convince new customers to come back. Now it seems as if the items are days old.

I normally go to Jumbo Donuts on Lincoln and Glassell. We were at 7/11 and decided to try Donut Star because it's across the street.  Jumbo donuts is around the corner and well worth the min drive.< /text>< gmapID>

< review>
I believe in supporting small business but this was pretty bad. They nuke their ham n cheese croissant but globbed in the middle was the cheapest ham, sliced rolled up, 1/2 slice of american cheese and way too many jalapeños. The strawberry banana boba smoothie was disgusting and the service was so slow it was embarrassing. All the while a woman was yelling at, her son?... instead of getting off her butt to help the poor kid. Not good at all guys... I will not be back< /review>

Great donuts. Great customer service. It's always nice to hear, "Hey! How have you been? I haven't seen you in a while. Things good?" from the staff. My first choice for donuts.< /Review>

I got a dozen donuts. Half of them were over cooked and tasted burnt. The traditional sprinkle donuts we’re good. The maple and chocolate bars were burnt. The maple bar had a very good maple flavor separate from the donut. The jelly donuts were absolutely terrible. The jelly tasted like licking red plastic. Probably from being over cooked.

Pros- they take debit/credit, the glaze on the donuts is good and the service was as good as any.

Cons- hi expectations from being Moreno Valley’s voted best donut shop and served over cooked burnt donuts.</Review>

<Review>Pleasant service at both locations (the other is on Perris Blvd). And some of the freshest and softest donuts in Moreno Valley. And the ham and cheese croissant is awesome. If you stop in for a bite and some coffee you won't be disappointed.</Review>< rate>

The last two times I came here my donuts were raw. I understood the apple fritter because added moisture but my regular donut was raw too.< /Review>

<text>Went today in the morning, and one of the two girls working there was so rude. I went into trying to buy a dozen and she didn’t even give me time to choose properly. Went up to pay and asked me if that was it and I responded yes. Then ten seconds later she yells at me is that it. Went with about 5-6 Coworkers  who told me originally about this place After what happened today,  we are all staying away from this place now and telling friends and family to stay away.</text><GmapID>0x80dca717769c57fd:0xdb13be130bffb215</GmapID>< username>

Better Be Donuts has the freshest baked goods: from light and fluffy glazed donuts to delicious cake donuts and delectable apple fritters, as well as other standard donut selections - they even have ham and cheese filled croissants that are better than the ones from Starbucks. They are open at 5:30 am 7 days a week and close at 9:00 pm every day except Sunday when they close at 8:30 pm.

I usually visit once a week and try to go first thing in the morning when the donuts are freshest and still a bit warm. On a few occasions when I was unable to stop in the morning I called ahead and asked to have my order pre-packed for pick up anytime up until closing, thus ensuring I would have my weekly doughnut fix.

The employees are well mannered, attentive, and are quick to help. But be warned; these doughnuts are so good that by closing time there is little selection left from which to choose.  If you can't go until late, it's best to call ahead to pre order.< /Review>

Every time we go they have no selection left just left over ones from earlier. We left the last few times. One time because the selection was really limited and there was flies in the display case we told him and he blamed it on people not obeying the sign to keep door closed but there was quite a few landing all over them, gross< /Review>

I want to recognize the outstanding job done Steven did for me here at Irvine Bicycles.

I took my 2018 Santa Cruz Tallboy C build MTB here to have my bottom bracket, broken spokes, and brakes checked.

Steven did an amazing job done, I saw the quality and thorough job he did while servicing my bike. He did not try up sale me or add in things like many other bike shop services at other places. His goal was the same as my goal, to get back out on the dirt with minimum down time, that’s the kind of bike technician you want working with you!

I’ve also brought in other bikes to have Steve look at, and continues to do a thorough job!

Thank you.

Steven</text>

like so many car dealerships, they don't make money selling bikes, but on service.  It is overpriced, more expensive than most all other bike shops in the area, I've tried them out a few times, it has always ended with me being on the short end of the stick.  It is focused on profits, not customer service or needs.   Should steer clear.  If I pay more, I expect top rate service, not so here.  Serviced brakes several times, charged labor each time, but it's still not fixed.  how difficult could bike brakes be??  that should say it all.  I won't even speculate about ethics here, you just have to guess, who it benefits when you have repeated problems, over and over, reminds me of the days in college with car dealerships.<//review>

<Text>Refused to work on my bike for swapping out crank arm because I took it to my team coach for a shift trouble. They built the bike and it wasnt shifting right. Took it back to them twice and paid them twice but couldnt get it fixed. My coach fixed it perfect without charging me. And now they are refusing service on my bike. I had good impression on them for 2 years and now I am very disappointed with their refusal. Rude and expensive.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

As someone who knew nothing about bikes aside from how to mostly ride one, I am so grateful for Frank, Peter, and everyone working in the shop when I came in. I would have laughed me out of the store, but everyone was very helpful and got me matched with the perfect bike for what I need.  They were even able to deliver it to me after everything was customized to what I wanted! They’ve got a loyal customer for life.< /review>

<text>I called them to get a gear cable to change my rear derailleur cabling that had broken and they said bring your bike to the shop to see what cabling is best for you. I took the bike there and they said it will cost $30 to replace and leave the bike there for the job. When I went to pick up the bike the next day they charged me over $60. They are ok but I don't trust them with their quotes. They will raise their price. Be careful with pricing.< /text>< Pictures>

I decided to try this bike shop because it was close to home.  All I needed was a 5 foot length of cable housing: I was charged $5 a foot (even after questioning the amount).  Online you can buy it for $1 a foot or even brand-name with the cable included for less.

Not a very good promotion for future business!<//Text>

The best value & reliable option if you're in SF for weekend trips or all-season rentals. If you come by on a weekday, hopefully you'll get Kenny. Fast, knowledgeable and fair!

While they no longer credit your rentals to the purchase of new skis, you can't beat $360 for a full season of premium ski rentals, and the saved hassle & time of renting/fitting new skis at each resort.

Also, make sure you bring 1 ski boot to your rental session!<//review>

<Text>I have to write this review because I like things done right and I was amazed at the level of detail, service and great tune up they provided.
The two times I've visited the shop for flat tires and a tune up, they've done amazing work and at a reasonable price.
I'm bringing my bike here from now on. Good job and thank you Irvine Bicycles!!!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dcdd6bab93d1c9:0x933f272750c269d7< /gmapID></record>

The service was outstanding.  Since I was purchasing my first bike, I had a lot of questions and I always had 1-4 guys helping me with answers and suggestions.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  Thank you guys for making this an enjoyable experience.<//Text>

As a 10 time Ironman finisher I’m crazy particular about my bikes and service. Frank, Peter and the whole crew go out of their way to make my bikes race ready. No matter what you need, they’ll have it or get it for you ASAP. It’s the rare find...a bike ship that makes everyone feel comfortable and important.<//text>

Nice guys but overpriced products and services.   I purchased a brand new bike on-line and took it to Irvine Bicycles to assemble. The bike was practically built already except for the dropper post, which required internal cabling, and the front disc brake to be installed.   They charged me the full pro-build price of $250 for a boxed bike.  This is not a frame-up build. I knew that was pricey, but I did agree to it only because I did not want to bother shopping around.  They gave me a free 30-day adjustment period.

I went back to the shop about a month later for adjustments.  Frank said the 30-day did not apply because I changed out components.  I had changed the rear derailleur because I bent it on my first ride off-road. I had to get a new tire because the tube blew and it blew out the tire beads.  I also changed the handlebar and stem to fit me better.    I did not modify the hydraulic brake system.

I totally understand why the 30-day did not apply because it was like rebuilding the bike, but then again……they charged me $250 assembly for a boxed bike that was practically built already.   I would have appreciated it if they can install the new oval chainring I bought (by the way, I highly recommend the oval chainring). Frank was going to charge me $45 to install the oval chainring.   I knew that was pricey, so I declined.  I left the bike for them to “look it over”.

I picked up my bike later that day and took it another local bike shop to install the chainring.  $15 and  10 minutes later I was enjoying my newly installed chainring  (by the way, the Truvativ Stylo crank was easy to take off to install the chainring; catch it on YouTube).

The point I want to make is……shop around.  In fact, on a couple of occasions before I bought my bike on-line, I had gone to Irvine Bicycles but the prices were too high.  I know it’s tough being a local bike shop on pricing, but it’s all about building relationships.  I’m not here to tell Irvine bicycles how to run their shop. I really wanted Irvine Bicycles to be my “go-to” shop for my cycling needs, but based on my experience, the pricing and relationship just isn’t there.< /review>

Worked with Peter who got me fitted to my Cannondale Synapse.  First of all, he steered me to the right bike for my kind of riding and then spent all the time it took to get me properly fitted. The mechanic, I wish I knew his name, applied the bar tape and finished the bike as if he were working on his own bike.  They were nice and very 'guy-to-guy' with me, not high-powered salesman.  They service my bike now and I feel like a supported racer knowing that pros have worked on my bike.  I recommend without reservation.<//Text>

< Review>
I came to the shop this weekend to get some advice on an old road bike I recently purchased. They told me that I was ripped off from the seller and that I wouldn't be able to find shimano levers that old on retail, and that a pair of used ones would cost about $150. I got a second opinion at another bike shop who tested them and found a brand new pair for half the price that Irvine Bicycles suggested, and they were still sold in retail.</Review>

I came here in search of a new road bike because they carried other; more boutique brands of bicycles. I was doing heavy research both online and at various bike shops, and the staff at Irvine Bicycles had no problem with me just browsing and testing out various bikes.  I eventually settled on a Felt Z85 which I love to this day. It fit within my style of riding, and more importantly, my budget! They also made sure I fit the bike by supplying an expert fitting that took about an hour... any reputable bike shop should do this for you.< /text>

My friend walked in here today and asked if they carried a bike brand he was looking for. The guy at the front yelled “NOPE!” and walked away. It wasn’t just pointless, it felt condescending. Obviously doesn’t want to sell a bike. This is why people shop at Jax.</text>

< Review>
I have been a customer of this place for a long time and buy all my bikes here. They are an authorized Colnago dealer and they helped me build up my colnago concept aero with the the perfect components tuned in. Once i put a deep scratch into the frame and they had it sent to a local person they knew who does repair work for colnago. The work was done perfectly and you cannot tell there was damage there, all for a reasonable price. When this shop sells you a bike, they take care of you.</Review>

<text>When you walk in you can already tell that the morale is low and people don't enjoy working there.  The owner or manager quoted me $70 for a Conti tire that sells for $79 for a pair on most online sites.  When I asked about price matching he got highly critical of online shops and how you can't trust them.  Whether there was any merit to what he was saying is negligible.  The people are rude and very disinterested in customer service.  The good thing is that I was only in the ares shortly and will never need to go again.  DO NOT GO HERE.< /text>< time>

They have excellent customer service here. If you are a Sepcialzied bike fan,  this is not the place for you. This shop carriers brands like Colnago which is pretty rare to see in Orange County.
Their shop may not look 100% neat,  but it's a bike shop so no big deal.</Review>

<Rate>3</Rate><text>Ok. Here is the good-Brian is an excellent mechanic and very knowledgable. The shop carries a diverse line of bikes and should be among your first/last visit for a road bike (I would not recommend for MTB...unless it's for service-TALK TO BRIAN). Here is the bad-It is NOT a great retail experience. Accessories are difficult to find and there is flotsam/jetsam on every available counter surface. They have good product/inventory but it is not logically presented. Could use a big and effective re-organization.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Avoid Frank, if you can. He is the one with glasses trying to sell you something, but never working on the bikes.

The mechanics are generally knowledgeable and helpful.  When I'm lucky enough to drop in while Frank is away, the experience is good.

However, I've had repeat experiences to the point that I now peek just to see whether Frank is behind the register.

He once made a major fuss over me trying to use a credit card to pay for a $40 purchase. Seriously if its that important to save the fractional service charge for cc processing when you're already charging full MSRP on basic accessories, you might be doing something wrong.

Today I had the misfortune of listening to Frank try to up-sell an old man a new tire for his "value class" mtb which he brought in for a simple flat fix. The tires showed age, but little actual wear. Frank didn't even inspect the tire for damage / puncture debris which, if found, might justify replacement.  He immediately turned on the sales pressure. The man made it clear he was "old and broke" and his bike fit the bill.  This didn't dissuade Frank at all. "Save time and money if you replace both [tube and tire] now".

One time I asked Frank if he had glue for tubulars and he tried to sell me tufo tape. I clarified, "its for cylco-cross" and he continued to school me on how the high tire pressure paired with the tape... I all but lost it.

I happen to live around the corner and would prefer shopping locally, but with such experiences, its my last resort.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<review>Tried to schedule an appointment but was denied service for no apparent reason. Asked the staff if they are trained professionals to treat severe muscle aches. Her response is that they are just general massage therapists and that I would now need a doctors note to come in. Absolutely terrible service dealing with a potential new customer. Service rep working at 1pm Friday, Feb 5th.<//review>< rating>

<text>Kathy was sooooo amazing. Professional, and  a seasoned one at that. I could tell by all the pressure points she was hitting. Yes she used a lot of feet, and I will say that it's not for the faint of heart mainly because the pressure can be intense. But if you're like me and enjoy medium and harder pressure you'll absolutely love it and get kinks worked out. Currently in a dreamy state and about to chug tons of water to continue detoxing. Enjoy!< /text>< pics>

You're not paying a premium, so you're not going to get some of the add-ons you might associate with more upscale massages, but the actual massage itself is incredibly good. The masseuses are all very thoughtful and experienced, and they're also very receptive to requests to customize comfort level and pressure.< /review></record>

In the heart of Mission Valley (super easy to get to).  Talk about a hidden gem!  Amazingly cute place and incredible services!  Shelly gave me the best massage I have ever had ( and I have had quite a few).  Highly recommend!</Review>

Took my mother here for her birthday. She had a 60 minute signature massage with an extra 30 minute foot massage.  90 minutes total for only $100 because it was our first time the gave us a $10 dollar discount.  They were very nice and amazing. Great service!!! I will be coming back.<//review>

LA Sports Massage is my favorite place for a Massage. Come here twice a week religiously for past 8 months. All the staff is amazing and their therapists are actually knowledgeable in muscle groups and how to work problem areas. Highly recommend this place over any cookie cutter institute like Massage Envy or Heavenly Massage. This is an actual Therapeutic Massage place. They do unique therapies such as cupping on top of standard massages like deep tissue or Swedish.</Text>

Ashley was amazing! The room is very intimate and private but at the same time super relaxing. Everything from the decor to the music to Ashley's expertise, I give it a 10/10. Best massage in a while.<//Review>

<Text>This point in an oasis in the urban jungle called San Francisco. It's like walking into a serene, quiet, peaceful environment just steps away from the hustle and bustle. I recommend a 90 minute time massage Arrive early so you can enjoy the tea garden, and stream that flows through Suchada.< /Text><user>109936365525681908284< /user>< Rate>

This is not a spa.  It's the place you go for a manly massage.  Hua, brought some amazing massage techniques from his native Hong Kong. If you are a man and want a strong massage, this is the place to go ask for Hua.</review>

I've booked appointments here 6-7 times and am always been impressed with the quality of massage therapists. However, I'm not interested in supporting a studio that pays some of their trained and licensed therapists $11 an hour while I pay $100+ tip. I understand they have a business to run and facility to maintain. I just don't want to enrich owners that charge a premium, then pay below standard market wages (poverty level by westside standards) and expect me to make up for it with my tip.

They also SPAM me with emails which don't contain a legitimate unsubscribe link.<//text>

<Review>Went to my first appointment for 30 minutes with Tyshon. Been having some inflammation on my left leg cause I don't stretch enough and had a knot of my foot. I was limping for the past couple days and after this session I felt so much better. Decided to book another appointment and go an 1hr. Clean place and were helpful. Tyshon knew what my problem was and was able to make me feel much better than when I first step foot on the door.</Review>< gmapID>

I recommend them to all my clients (I coach) and friends. When two orthopaedic surgeons told me I had so much structural damage to both my Achilles that I could never run again, Dennis Lisaius, the owner, kept my body working well enough fur me to get national rankings at stupidly long runs. Can't say enough good things about them!<//review>

< Review>
This is the only car wash i go too, convenient being near my house and appreciate their good job on keeping all washing tools functional .
I can suggest a couple of things might need to take a look at. Paying with a ATM is a burden sometimes work something it doesn’t . Maintenance people at night time , be rude by blocking bays and can’t ask them a question cause they complete ignore any questions .
One suggestion I have for you guys , is if you guys can post signs letting customers know to have courtesy once Finnish washing and air drying their car .  It might avoid a few arguments between customers,cause some customers like to wax and hand dry their car in the bay  not concern about others trying to wash their car.</Review>

Best car wash in the area if you don't like drive ins and others touching your car. Some sketchy people either manage or hang around the car wash which is weird but they mind their business. I dislike when some are smoking cigarettes around your bay, which is disrespectful.<//review>

Lawndale Self Car Wash is perfect location for me it's on the way to King Harbor Marina where my Best Friend works & Lives on his Boat. It only costs $3 for me to have enough time to get a Good Car Wash.</text>

<Review>This is now my go-to spot for the years to come (hopefully). Cards and coins accepted, plenty of bays, not very busy, great value for the time, great selection of tools - ie. tire cleaner and air dryer. This blows almost all other nearby self service car washes.<//Review>< pics>

Very nice place, I love the fact that you can use your debit/credit card for washing, it gives you 12 minutes for $5.00 dollars. They have Presoak, high pressure soap, Tire cleaner, 3 color foam conditioner, foaming brush, high pressure rinse, spot free rinse (Soft water leaves no water spots when water dry) and air dryer. I also had a problem a while ago whit my car getting demaged on a broken drain cover and they paid for the repairs without any struggle totally recommend the place.</text>

Glad you found us and enjoyed your first experience.\n\nFor the AMEX issue, I am not sure our credit card system supports it but I will look into that for you (we buy the credit card system from a 3rd party company and can’t usually change the settings).\n\nFor the high pressure soap, the chemical has to make its way from the soap tank in the room through the hose and clear out the water that was used before it, so it does take some time to see it show up in the bay. However, it shouldn’t take that long - maybe only 10-20 seconds at most (also note: if you happened to be in one of the bays farthest from the chemical room, the soap has to travel farther, so try one of the bays right next to the room next time which should help).  The high pressure soap won’t really “suds” up and get foamy though since it is mixed with the high pressure water - for the really foamy soap make sure to try the Foam Brush instead.\n\nThanks again for the nice and honest review and hope to see you back at our wash again soon!'}<//Response>
<Review>Update:
Visited this location again and the soap quantity was perfect. Think it was just a fluke wash. Owner replied—(as seen) and I’ll look forward to AMEX maybe becoming available one day. I have updated my review to (5) stars!

Review:
I have been searching all over for a Self-Service Car Wash that accepts credit cards. This establishment accepts Visa, Mastercard, and Discover and it's a pretty simple system to use. I used my Visa card tonight and paid $5 for a 12min car wash that I was presently surprised with. I will say the High-Pressure Soap didn’t start spraying suds until about 60+ sec. and was not as sudsy as I expected but it did get the job done. My vehicle was moderately dirty from the recent rainfall in SoCal.

Things I liked:
- Ability to use Credit Cards: Visa, Mastercard, and Discover
- DO NOT take away Credit Cards abilities, please!
- High powered "triggered" blower was AMAZING and nothing like I have seen in a Self-Service Car wash before.
- High-Pressure Sprayer has good water pressure and excellent wide spray angle

Things I feel need Improvement:
- Credit Card Acceptance for AMEX —(I understand AMEX charges higher fees, so maybe charge AMEX card users $6-7 instead of $5 for 12min) I personally would use my AMEX card and pay the ($1-2) increase in fees for my points and AMEX customer service backing.
- High-Pressure Soap dispenses more suds during the wash—(This could be a one-time issue and I will update review in such case I find it’s fixed)< /Review><user_id>109796208191112654392</user_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< rate>

They have the best variety of products you can apply while washing your car... Meaning directly from the wand & they even have a blower gun for blow drying  your car... The only self serve around that I know of with.many of their choices.< /Text>

The park was clean besides some graffiti on the benches outside. The guy cleaning the park was a bit rude however. I didn't enjoy my visit there, came here to rest after walking for two hours but left quickly after.< /Text>

Go home and smoke pot all you want, losers! The only time the park is decent is when they have the volunteers come to play games and do crafts with the kids after school, they are always nice, we have stopped going due to the park being such a mess..<//Text><Response>None</Response><UserId.>117942215721038104960<//UserId.><Date>1492673033924< /Date></record>

A really scary part from a human aspect. The reality is, this part sit in between the Norwalk city service yard ,and a grade school . Surrounded by factories. The best part, most days you'll find an amazing assortment people , ranging in the unlawful septum of human exsistence. They have a children's activity center here for summer events. Two basketball courts. The restrooms are swell to say the least. Baseball is the biggest field here. The walking path is ok, but the sprinkler system and pooling water from the construction yard, make it impossible to enjoy the park. When the park is only less than a square mile. It is a "utilitarian" park.<//text>

(Translated by Google) This park might look nice, and well lit at night for games, and all that, but it is a meeting place for drug and alcohol use! The light of day and night! I have also repeatedly used condoms in the parking lot as I got out of my car! This park is adjacent to Dolland Elementary School and many children go through this park and even stay to play in the after school programs provided by the park. The school staff afterwards is friendly, but they can't stop pot smokers! I DO! I call and report any strange behavior! I have reported time after the use of the time of drugs and alcohol and all the garbage seems to me that it tells me that these activities are frequent and without being seen by anyone using the park! What is wrong with people? You all have cell phones use them! Call Norwalk Security: 929-1677 or 863-8711 Norwalk Sheriff Let's make this park safe for our children! I can't give this park rating greater than POOR as it is! This park MIGHT appear Nice, and well lit at night for games, and all, but it is a gathering spot for Drug and alcoholic use! IN DAYLIGHT and evening! I have also on several occasions found used condoms in the parking lot as I got out of my car! This park is NEXT to Dolland Elementary School and many Children pass through this park and even stay to play in the after school programs provided by the park. The after school staff is friendly but they cannot stop the pot smokers! GONE! I call and report any strange behavior! I have reported time after time use of drugs and alcohol and all the trash I find that tells me that these activities are frequent and unseen by anyone else using the park! What is wrong with people? YOU all have cell phones USE THEM! Call Norwalk Safety: 929-1677 or Norwalk Sheriff 863-8711 LET'S Make this park a safe one for our children! I cannot give this park rating higher than POOR as is!

Este parque podría parecer bonito, y bien iluminado por la noche para los juegos, y todo eso, pero es un lugar de reunión para uso de drogas y alcohol! La luz del día y la noche! Tengo también en varias ocasiones que se encuentran los condones usados en el estacionamiento como salí de mi coche! Este parque se encuentra junto a la Escuela Primaria Dolland y muchos niños pasan por este parque e incluso quedarse a jugar en los programas después de la escuela proporcionados por el parque. El personal de la escuela después es amable, pero no pueden detener a los fumadores de marihuana! LO HAGO! Llamo y reportar cualquier comportamiento extraño! He reportado tiempo después de la utilización del tiempo de las drogas y el alcohol y toda la basura me parece que me dice que estas actividades son frecuentes y sin ser visto por cualquier persona usando el parque! Qué está mal con la gente? Todos ustedes tienen teléfonos celulares usarlos! Llame a Norwalk Seguridad: 929-1677 o 863-8711 Norwalk Sheriff Vamos a hacer este parque sea seguro para nuestros hijos! No puedo dar esta calificación parque mayor que POBRES como es!    This park MIGHT appear Nice , and well lit at night for games, and all, but it is a gathering spot for Drug and alcoholic use !

While I’m not a cider drinker, my girlfriend is. However, after spending an evening here I think I will start drinking more ciders. This place was so great they’ve turned me on to ciders (not as my first choice still). The concept was really cool: choose 3 ciders as a flight and enjoy. Excited to return next time I am in San Diego.</Text>

< Review>
I visited Bivouac for the first time this weekend and it was nothing short of a great experience! The establishment was decorated with an “outdoor” theme, with meaning behind their decorations, and it was very clean! The service was amazing, attentive and nice staff, giving us all the info of what the ciders were and explaining them so we could really decide which ones to order. The cider was AMAZING, very fresh bright in flavor! I cannot wait to buy some 6 packs for the next outdoor adventure. So happy with my experience I can’t wait to go back! Love this place.<//Review>

The ambience was great, the drinks were superb, and the service was A1. My friends and I ordered the beer flight, and my favorite was the chai IPA. It was earthy, caffeinated, and had the right amount of chai. If I could get a whole keg of it, I would!

This place is definitely a great weeknight hangout. They have outdoor and indoor seating, and the decorations are simple, yet impactful. I absolutely recommend going here for a drink or a small treat!< /Text>

<userid>106501510921392075803< /userid><Review>We went for cider and brunch. Neither disappointed. Each did a flight of cider. Savoy was our favorite, with San Diego Jam coming in a class second. Next time we will bring a growler to fill. Their growlers are cool, but very pricey.

Brunch was the Campfire Scramble with a side of potatoes, which we shared. Both were prepared wonderfully. Flavorful with no additional seasoning needed.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Awesome cider! However, know that the food is not  worth ordering. We ordered a few flights of ciders and were all impressed, but the table agreed the real winner of the night was there non-alcoholic cider option. It was incredible.

The food was lackluster, to say the least. High prices (~$16-18) for our entrees (burger, risotto, fish and chips) and charcuterie board. Servings were small, but not quite delicious. No one left pleased with their meal.< /Text>

I'm not a Cider drinker but my wife is so we visited while in SD, and I have to say I was very impressed.
We had a couple of flights all all were really good. Much like craft beer, these Cider's are nothing like the "big boys" that you see everywhere and that definitely a good thing.

Loved the decor in the bar, staff friendly and helpful. Well worth the visit!<//Text>

Great selection of ciders, with both traditional and experimental flavors. I did prefer the more traditional ones, a testament to the quality of the fruit and to their process.

Tried one food item, the chilli fries, which were delicious, crispy and well seasoned. Very friendly and helpful service too.</Review>

Good cider, I only took a star off because it would be better if the windows and doors were closed. With them open it was hot and a lot of noise came in from the street. FLIES EVERYWHERE</Review>

Service is lacking, there were 2 servers and it seemed nobody wanted to make eye contact or offer service. Servers were on their phones,  sipping cider, and giving preferential service to their regulars and friends.

That said the ambiance is beautiful.

Super cool place with great service, amazing flavors for both food and ciders. The wait staff are all super friendly and shout out to hostess Sophie and our waitress Sophia for making our experience top notch! Highly recommend the fish and chips and the grass fed burger paired with the Savoy cider. Delish!<//Review>

If you enjoy cider, this is the place for you. With 6 house ciders on tap, and 5 guest cider, you won't get bored. They also serve brandy and fruit distilled spirits. I recommend the ceviche, delish!< /Review>

<Review>It's great having a cider place in North Park.  I love all the beer tasting rooms, but some people aren't beer drinkers. Bivouac fills that side need. Besides... The food is great!</Review>< pics>

<Review>Gorgeous space for upscale cider tasting experience, with artisanal ciders sourced globally.  Exquisite attention to detail from stone laced bar stools carried through to stone tap handles encasing slices of apple inside.  Fantastic, creative brunch menu to die for too with Egg Cochon poached egg over pulled pork, bread pudding and gochujang coated crispy potatoes, super fragrant Fried Rice with crab and spam.  Love this place so much, I consider it worth the drive from LA to SD many times over.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoFa4odLCjd2Un7iF3tCplRUNtAs_sBD9BVDOI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOy6KDCmwaEJAupBFk4eKVv4LpbHpKMB35zk56A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1gSroPhquZE70ziodXqTFlHH978fXOeCoFcND=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPE9JJksglT1WcvDER6CKLQsy2lLW6ZRGMXaQ3f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhh_hFucv4zL8OfL7FDrmbGovEJWdxQvKyqoFP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8M57h8G1Y401p_M3zQ5EnGny4HQ7xUgdGO_JV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkkdaWKh3KoNPVatObGEYsXhzwzO2uzg7zoiht=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Bivouac is a great local space to meet up with friends. The selection of ciders is eclectic and fun to try the different flavors. The food is also delicious and, combined with the ciders, made for great time with friends.< /Text>

I really enjoyed the ciders last night. We visited this place when they opened, was really disappointed and didn't go back. We visited another great cidery in the area, Serpentine, and they told us to give Bivouac another chance. I'm really glad we did. We had 2 flights each, and was able to navigate their whole line up. We did not have one that was disappointing. From prickly pear to strawberry ginger, they all tasted great. I ended the night with an Ube Pina Colada mixed cocktail and was very impressed! We really appreciated the staff and the drinks. We didn't eat, but now will definitely be back for dinner as well.< /review>

Came during covid-19 crisis, got cider to go.

We spent a long time deciding and discussing what to get. The lovely Bartender Chris was so patient and helpful to us. We really appreciate places and people like this within our community.

We will absolutely be back once things "normalize" again.< /Text>

<Text>This is beautiful little cidery. Wonderful bar opening onto the sidewalk. Womderful bartender - helpful and fun. Good food and service. The grass fed burger was absolutely amazing. The bad news is the cider isn't that great. Tried 4 in a flight and they all tasted about the same. I'm a big cider fan so this was disappointing.<//Text></record>

Among the best ciders I've ever tasted was their 'Alpine' flavor. Place is covered from head to toe with subtle stylistic touches that really enhances the laid back friendly atmosphere. You must order the street corn, for it would be a serious crime against foodies the world over if you were to pass up such an opportunity.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Very cool atmosphere, friendly personable staff and inventive ciders brewed in house (tanks in the back). An $11 3-cider flight is the right way to go. They also have food if this is your only stop in North Park. Flavours change throughout the months. To celebrate fall, I tried the Cat’s Paw, a pear and pumpkin cider (basically pumpkin spice). The other two were amazing as well but I’ll leave it to you to explore for yourself. ;)< /review>

We came just before it started to rain.  It's a shame because they have a nice front patio.  It was still great as they had board he's and plenty of seating.  I tried a sip of the mango habanero which I was hoping was more mango than habanero.  I tried the Albright, a pear cider with hints of vanilla that was tasty.  The Sheepshank, which is matcha cucumber, tasted better after a few sips.  The San Diego Jam is a sweet blackberry cider which I quote liked but my friend did not.<//review>

I do not know a better word than impeccable to describe Bivouac. Their cider as well as their food is absolutely delicious and their service alone deserves five stars. Everyone is incredibly welcoming, knowledgeable and goes above and beyond for all of their customers. If you happen to live in the San Diego area or just visiting you must make this place on the top of your list. Grab a flight of cider and some tasty food and the experience will be delightful!</review>

Found this place on a list of greats places to visit in San Diego and boy was I not disappointed! The ciders were amazing the food was pretty good and the atmosphere was very inviting. We had an issue with some flies (it’s an open air seating area) but it’s California what do you expect. Will definitely be back<//Review>

My wife and I were pretty lucky to get princess parking on 30th.  The atmosphere was inviting. I enjoyed the"camping" theme.  I forgot to ask how to pronounce the name of this place.  The cider was pretty good but I found the flavors a bit flat.  The Hunter's Bend was my favorite of the five we tried.  Expensive menu but the food was good and service fantastic.  We'll be back hoping for more flavor complexity.  Good to see a solid addition to the North Park scene.<//review>

Bivouac was epic! 🌲❤️ The ambiance is so chill and inviting, love the feel of the place! Also the staff was friendly and helpful. Most importantly the food was delicious! Try the wings- best ever, along with the chk salad and hummus, so delicious:) Loved the cider and you can get some sweet swag too. Got to meet the owner, she is equally inviting and fun and friendly, great place, get there!:) Embrace your adventure<//Text>

<review>Fun spot! The outdoor bar seating is prime real estate, especially when paired with some classic San Diego weather. Unfortunately, the house made ciders were just ok. Despite the delicious descriptions, I found the actual flavor profiles to be a little muted. Food was just ok as well, but I’m open to coming again to try some other menu items.</review>< pics>

<text>Beautiful venue! Perfect chill/ laid back date spot. They have a ton of ciders of course but they do still have some cocktails, beer, and wine if you prefer but don't expect some large selection. Great for groups as well! The food is pretty good for it being supplementary. I'm not big on Cider so I liked that they allow you to do flights so you can try different things.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80d954f6e5ea13ff:0xb0906cf5c9bba6c0<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place offers an extensive cider menu.  The awesome part is they have a legend that tells you which ciders are dry vs sweet. They also have creative appetizers and the vibes are trendy and fun. It's also pretty casual which makes it easy.<//Text>

Bivouac is a new ciderworks in the heart of North Park, which is craft beer heaven. They do have beer at Bivouac, but they are known for their cider. I don't often drink cider because I imagine it as a super sweet drink. Not the case at all! I had three different fry ciders that weren't sweet at all, just delicious!  The food is also excellent. Great wings, the clam chowder was more like steamed muscles (but clams) in a delicious sauce. The Patty melt, hummus and poke were all wonderful. Great place!<//text>

I absolutely loved it here! My best friend who lives within walking distance (how cute is North Park btw) took me here because she knew it'd be a place a gluten free person could love.

I don't always get to have a flight of anything, mostly because there not usually more than one or two ciders available at other places, so being able to try both the In and Out ciders and Bivouac was an incredible experience.

Also, the fries are freaking amazing. So amazing, I made a phone background with them.< /Review>

<Date>1517784581253</Date><text>For the first week of being open, this place had really great service! We had been waiting for a good cider place to open in our area for a while. If you like Newtopia you will love Bivouac in my opinion. Not only are their ciders outstanding, but they have a really great menu to boot. We were really pleased with the vegetarian dishes that anyone would enjoy. It’s a must in North Park!</text>< UserId.>

<review>A solid spot limited only by their theme, with great food and awesome ciders and brandys. The alpine decor is one of the most innovative in town for this small and hip local spot. I wish they put more emphasis on European ciders from Europe (French and basque especially), but they brew their own and have to keep that a focus.</review><response>None< /response><rate>5</rate>< time>

Fabulous ambience and great service. Menu is beautiful in theory and a little lackluster in taste for the price. Pretty good happy hour selection including $9 flights of delicious small batch cider. The big booth is a big swing which is super fun!<//Text>

Overrated hipster restaurant. It was like they said, "what are all the popular trends with food right now?" and then proceeded to make all of them, but do a subpar job of it. Would maybe only go back for the atmo and the collection of drinks. Should probably stick to the cider because it was the only thing that made our time and money worth spending there.< /Text>

< review>
This place is really well decorated and has great cider. Unfortunately, they had a special menu tonight and it didn't have any vegan options at all. Their normal menu online shows vegan options but their random special menu tonight did not. We had a couple drinks and then went somewhere else for food. As mentioned, it was a very nicely decorated place, but they had loudbmusic playing which literally left everyone yelling at each other just to try and order.

I'll try this place again in the future and will update my review then. But for now it wasn't that great of an experience.</review>

This place is very cool. Super trendy. The cider selection is great and mostly made in house which I can appreciate. They so have afew guest taps. The music was a little loud and the appetizers were good but it would have gotten five stars had they been just a little better. I didn't try a main course so perhaps I'll go back and adjust my review. Definitely still worth a stop... Especially if you're thirsty for a good cider.< /Review>

**Update: Liquor license granted, pouring from 23 January.

They're waiting on their liquor license, but don't let that stop you going for an amazing lunch. The burger is fantastic, their special ketchup is my new addiction, and they have plenty on the menu for vegans too. The fries are ultra thin and crispy, with just the right amount of garlic and parsley. The interior decor is gorgeous and clever, the vibe is classy and casual. Lara and the rest of the staff are great. Can't wait for their full opening!</review>

This new-ish place in my neighborhood is an absolute gem. The design is incredible, and I would come hang out here even if the food and drinks sucked- which they do not. I've tried almost all the ciders they offer currently and have not been disappointed by one. I love that they have dry, less sweet ciders. I wasn't expecting to be wowed by the food at a place known for the drinks, but all I can say is get the 'tongue and cheek nachos'. One of the top ten best dishes I've had in my life.
I love their commitment to using locally sourced food as well.

The service is really great in that "very friendly but not annoying" way. Hosts, bartenders, servers, bussers- everyone was smiling and helpful and honestly that is sadly hard to come by in restaurants these days.

Bivouac is now one of my favorite places to go on a date, with girlfriends, or take clients to for a hip atmosphere and delicious dinner. I wish I could just eat there every day.<//text>

Horrible service! I’m only reviewing service. Waitstaff and girl at door were oblivious. We sat at a table and were waiting for 20 minutes with no service, we even asked the girl at the door for a server and no one showed up. We finally left- happy that I didn’t waste my money on lousy service. Was very easy to walk to the next brewery that had great service!</Review>

<text>Bivouac’s summer menu release is a delightful tease of the imagination and a tastebud tantalizer. We’ll return until we’ve tried everything they have to offer. So far, I wholeheartedly recommend the swordfish belly tacos with sunchoke mole in handmade tortillas, the Korean BBQ braised beef short ribs on a kimchi cake, the Achiote chicken salad with charred lime vinaigrette, aaand the banana bread donut topped with miso maple glaze. The three at our table savored every bite of our shared plates and watched each other’s eyes roll back in our heads. Really. Mouth party. #embraceyouradventure @bivouacnorthpark<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

The Cider and presentation were excellent. The food however, sub-par. I had the Waygu dinner plate. It was tough and gummy and nowhere near what Waygu beef should taste like. I would go back for the Cider, but not the food.<//text>

We enjoyed excellent service and tasty food in a simple but detailed atmosphere. Not fans of hard ciders and the ciders here don't deserve to be lumped in the same category.<//Text>

<username>Jay Shriver< /username><Time>1582331878786</Time><review>Edit to my below review ... I had another business trip to San Diego this week. I stopped at Bivouac and was hugely disappointed. The ciders tasted flavorless and watered down (another reviewer noted the same thing and she's right, even though I initially refused to believe it). Rumor has it they changed cider makers. Stay away, Serpentine is more of a drive but a much much better product.

Old review:
I love ciders. When I travel I look for cider houses to visit. On a recent work trip to San Diego I thought I wouldn't get a chance to visit Bivouac but a 4 hour delay in my Southwest flight gave me the window of opportunity I needed to visit. After a bus ride and some walking I arrived around 2 pm on a Friday afternoon. The first thing I noticed was the decor, I can see it being a popular place to socialize and enjoy some adult beverages. I took a seat at the bar near the window that opens onto 30th street. The bartender was sweet and very helpful. After discussing the flavors with her I had a flight of the Savoy, San Diego Jam and Hunter's Bend, and all were delicious. I also had a pint of the San Diego Jam and a pint of a Transom/Albright blend suggested by the bartender. All were very enjoyable. I also enjoyed talking to the owner Matt, he's a friendly guy who was very easy to talk to. I wanted to stay longer but it was time to call Uber and head off to the airport for my flight. I had a great time and would definitely go back!<//review>< Rating>

< review>
Bivouac is a new, rather unique restaurant and bar that specializes in their own house made cider with alcohol.  The place looks brand new with gorgeous furnishings(I got to sit at a booth with seats suspended from the ceiling that rock...fun).

There is a full bar and restaurant seating.

I had the cider flight consisting of 4 glasses ranging from apple to currant which was my favorite.  The cider is made in large, brand new, very cool looking distilling vats on the premises(that I photographed).

I ordered mussels and their signature "Impossible Burger" with shoestring fries and remoulade.

The mussels are top quality PEI(prince edward island canada) and were plump and exceedingly delicious in the buttery broth.

The burger was cooked perfectly to my specifications with gouda cheese on top and was so tasty; I award it best burger I've had so far this year.

Service by Owner Matt and server Anna was 1st rate.  Matt went over the selections with me and explained some interesting facts about the cider making process.

Bivouac is my favorite restaurant/ bar in North Park now...not bad for only being 8 weeks young.< /review>

It’s an easy in n out if you driving on highway 5. This McDonald’s parking is not the best and I never liked. Staff definitely have to deal with a lot of strange people. Food is great but rest room normally needs attention. Kudos to the staff to keep up with it. Food is always great and warm. Great deals on the app so do yourself a favor and order ahead in the app and choose curbside pickup rather then long wait in drive through. Your choice anyway.<//Text></record>

<review>McDonald's has improved their service the last few times I've been there have been great  got my proper order the food was hot the fries was perfect and soda didn't taste like water and the workers had a great attitude.i hope that they keep hiring friendly people who care about customer service and care about the food sent out of the facility they work at. After all we pay to get hot food and getting tasty food with good service. If you all don't get what you wanted to eat tasty. Go back through drive through and have it made for you again.< /review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Mobile order number was confirmed on loudspeaker and by window 1 then all of a sudden things changed once pulled up to window 2.

My order vanished and manager with no name badge just resorted to “I’m just following store policy” and “there’s nothing I can do” pawning me off to the 866 number. Showed her emailed receipt, mobile app, bank charge.

No refund has been issued and she just handed me someone else’s botched order. Still stating “oh by the way this is going to be a huge loss for our store, I’m just giving away this order” and slamming the door/window.

I’ll have to wait until Tuesday to talk someone at the call center now.

Ok so I know most McDonald’s have peanuts for the sundae the provide on the menu but if you ask for some at this location they will straight up tell you the don’t have any, (sarcastically) well thanks I love my sundae drenched in caramel with no peanuts and A very small amount of ice cream love paying the amount you ask for, for a simple sundae but no damn peanuts!!!!

<Review>To all male and female. It is not fair, for restrooms to be closed to community consumers. Is it not fair for the convenience of McDonald workers to have there own private toilet. This is not Covid procedures, this is taking advantage of the situation. Converting pandemic into ;I do what ever I want; We all urinate and release waste.  Stop treating people like animals. This message is to all McDonald structures who are active serving food and drink. Community means people. Treat us like people. How about a reimbursement to all consumers who wasnt able to use the restroom.  I JC speak the truth. I would not lie.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>My order was not correct nor was it fresh at all. I parked out front and called so I wouldn't have to wait in line again. Still the lady tells me to come back in the drive through, where I again had to wait in line. I received nothing but attitude from the younger female that was working the front drive-thru window. And no sense of urgency from staff.<//Text>< username>

<Review>I work down the street from this McDonald's location and I wouldn't ever go here if there was more of a food selection in this area. Before COVID this place is always overun by homeless people just hanging out taking up the majority of the tables. Now because of COVID, I go through the Drive Thru and 7 out of 10 times everything will go fine. But there are occasions where they will give me 0 napkins along with my food, they won't give me a straw for my drink, they forget to give me my dipping sauce for my nuggets, etc. It's a major inconvenience to have to go back or attempt to call them when you're on a short lunch break. I'm thankful this McDonalds is close to my work but if it weren't for that I would never go to this location.</Review>< Response>

<Review>Right off the highway easy to find.

Food has been good over the years whether it was made correct or not.

Plenty of parking and a long drive thru .
Careful with all the local people walking randomly through lot.

Before covid-19 the inside was newly updated and pretty clean.< /Review><pics>None</pics><username>Scott Deitzel< /username>< userid>

Would accept my mobile order with the coupon, and then we ordered again from what we did on the app and they didn’t use the coupon so we ended up paying more for some food that they most likely spit in.<//text>

< review>
Ronnie would roll over in his grave if he knew how much the food has changed. I remember as a kid that was the highlight of our week. Would be riding. Stingrays to McDonalds and was great. Now they are so focused on mass production. They food has no taste especially the hamburgers taste garbage. The french fries are still great as long as they have changed the oil in the fryer in a timely manor and they not cold when it comes through the window. It really is said what the fast food business has become. I guess really it is all about GREED and shareholders wanting the return on there investment. Corporate needs to wake up and put some pride back in to it or they just do not care. I am talking to you Mr. or Mrs. C.EO.< /review>

<Review>The food is usually your typical tasting fast food from McDonald's. We all know it nothing great but it's doable when hungry and need something quick n easy.  Had a quarter pounder meal.  The fries nd drink good love their fries but the burger got thrown out after the first bite. My first big disappointment by any McDonald's.<//Review>< Pics>

I celebrated my nomination last night in this excellent restaurant. I am glad to say that we enjoyed a outstanding evening and the restaurant was certainly the reason for the happy gathering. The waiters  helped in a gorgeous manner, the cuisine was extremely good and my buddies were extremely  happy. We shall no dout visit again for more celebrations. thanks very much.< /Review>

Odelia was so rude to me in the drive thru she literally THREW the happy meal when she handed it to us!!! I cannot believe her attitude when she was taking our order she was literally yelling at us when we asked to give us a minute to order. She is a “shift manager” and she is acting that way?? She needs to be fired asap!!!!<//Text>

Honestly, I do not like coming here because of the homeless outside the restaurant are super aggressive. A year ago I came here around 10pm a homeless person knocked on my window begging for money. I was terrified jump out of my seat cause I didn’t see him coming. It happened while I was trying to grab my card from my wallet.

Yesterday, came in around between 2-3 pm. The coolest part they accept apple pay now so that makes me happy. Payment window, young man African American super nice very engaging to the customers. Looks excited to serve people.

I feel bad for the young lady where u pick up your food. The guy before me was yelling at the lady telling her (you gave me old burger) lol... Then the young lady handed him another one he yelled at her again. He said (this burger is cold) hahaha at this point, I was like 😳 the customer is getting really aggressive. She asks him to park in the front so they can address all his complaints in the side, which is the right thing to do so.. We can get our food lol. When I get to the window she greeted Hi and smiles at me like nothing happened. This young lady needs a raise. She looks like an 17 years old African American. That’s awesome customer service right there. She even apologizes to me for the wait. She deserves recognition. I can attest. Oh wow! Been in Customer Service for 7 years. I appreciate people like this!!! I told her I’m sorry. She told me thank you I appreciate you. Man......!!!  She sure did lighten up my day. Hope get her name.<//Text>

Not the same as when we were kids. Used to have the best fries, now they are the worst. 2 stars for the any size drink for a dollar, nothing here for me to eat as the big Mac is like two jr patties!< /Text>

Located in a decent location right off the highway, convenient for those that commute ( right here 😁✌).  The homeless population is a bit high in the area as well.   You'll walk in and notice that have a security guard doing rounds.  Usually nothing is happening so they're just talking with co workers and taking it easy.  Some* ( only some ) of the staff takes it easy as well, you'll notice.  The bathrooms require a buzzer to open and you may recieve a little attitude when you're asking to use the restroom.  You may get an attitude from some of the girls at the register also when ordering you're food and asking for a special order. ( no onion or pickles earned me a huge eye roll 🙄).   Nevertheless I recieved my food in a decent time and sat down to eat.  The seating areas are nice, gotta give them that.  But I was bumped at least two times by a homeless guy who came and sat 2 seats next to me.  He was walking back and fourth ( good times ).  I also witnessed a lady order an iced coffee, right behind me and about 4 people were served before her.   2 stars for access off freeway, the food being hot and speedy, and seating arrangement.  Minus 3 stars because of non friendly staff ( manager was a coo guy tho ) , attitude while taking orders, lack of attention to customers, and lazy cleaning habits... mopping for one worker was about 15 minutes of complaining and 1 minute of dragging a mop around.  Also, bathrooms stink like if the walls were the urinals.  Hope this helps.< /Text>

The line was ridiculous, and slow. I tried three times to order 2 medium fries. And three times they missed it. When I told her she missed it at the order window, she told me just to tell the next person at the next window. When I did that she said oh yeah, I added it. When I got to the third window, she told me it was just one fry and unfortunately she could not add the fries. Ridiculous incompetence.<//Text>

<Text>I go here all the time and the wifi went off and I asked the boss lady that worked the shift if she could fix it and she said that they don't have WiFi and I told her that I was just using it.

Our coffee's were wrong. My daughter asked for1 cream and 6 sugar's. My order was 5 creams and 10 splenda.( Yes 10). Our orders are always the same no matter what McDonald's her or I go to. For some reason they can never get it right.<//text>

< Review>
I visit this McDonald's daily and notice something different each week. Like increase pricing and denial of certain promotions. Like coffee refills (U WON'T BE ABLE TO GET ANY!). FREE Ice Cream cone or Cookies when you do the survey a from receipt like all the other restaurants. It would seem to only only cares about raising prices. This place gets a lot of business. Which does compensate for the minor loss of revenue for the promotion's. I'm willing to believe he would cancel all promotions if he thought it would not hurt his business. he is very fortunate that there is no other businesses like this in the general area! Like Burger King and Jack in the box. I would go to these places instead of here. That's how I feel! Just keeping it 100< /Review>

<Review>Me and my wife just came from this McDonald’s and for the 3rd time the order was COLD and INCORRECT. This made the misses upset since she’d been craving McDonald’s the past week. She asked for a mcchicken w no mayo and got a mcchicken with mayo. She asked for 2 fries and got one so we had to go back around, the drive thru employee took forever to ask for our order and when they did they stopped talking and completely left for a few minutes. Then by the time we got home all the fries were cold and we found out about the mcchicken at the same time. DO NOT GO TO THIS MCDONALDS! Terrible service, Can’t get an order right and the amount of homeless people surrounding the McDonald’s was unheard of. I hope that McDonald’s gets shut down or everyone working there atleast could get fired.<//Review><Rate>1</Rate>< Gmap_id>

Constant homeless presence detracts from an overall average level of service. Frequent altercations within the restaurant with transient persons, and order accuracy leaves a lot to be desired. Staff is overall helpful.< /text>

This location treats all their customers like they're criminals trying to get over on them, I ordered 2 cpmbi meals and was only given 1 order of fries. When I brought it to the attention of the lady who gave me my food she went back inside and brought other orders out to other customers and THEN asked to see my reciept. I was on my way yo work and by this point running late. I tried handing her the bag so she could confirm what it contained but instead she wanted to look right at my reciept and say I only had 1 meal and two cheeseburgers when the reciept plainly said 2. I walked over to the door with my receipt and a nice young lady tried to get the fries and then the manager started yo argue with her about it, even though she was showing him the slip. It took 3 people to get my fries, and no apology or anything.I've never had such a rotten experience at McDonald's in my life and won't ever come to this one again.<//Review>

As always the McChicken sandwich was tasty. Can't beat the cost but when they want .75 cents for extra lettuce that's too much. If you want tomatoes it's .75 extra, what happened to customer satisfaction.</text>

<Text>Downgraded it to two stars. Reason I downgraded it is went through drive-thru and ordered a sausage McMuffin and a sausage burrito.went back inside show them my receipt and they corrected the order. No apologies nothing.there is a homeless problem around this location which I don't believe they're doing anything about.this is the worst McDonald's location I have been to and I only stopped there when there is simply no other choice.</Text><userid>108196681929835619890</userid>< gmap_id>

What can I say about a place as ubiquitous as McD. This location has the fastest service ever. Two drive thru lanes, and they always get it right. How do they do that? Really impressed with the service there and I have traveled some. Unfortunately, they have a  phalanx of home bless awaiting. Do not feed them. They will break into your car for nothing and leave the change.< /text>

<review>They forget part of our order 3 out of 5xs double 1/4 lb. Second time meat wasn't cooked all the way. Same restaurant that takes your order so fast you can't tell them what you want.  And it doesn't matter if you check your order on screen cause most of the time order is wrong. We ordered large mocha frapps we got small.  Fast is good but only if your order is correct. Sorry this is a FAIL MCDONALDS<//review>< Pics>

Loved the fries!!!🤘 It had been quite a while since I'd gone to McDonald's. Thank you for not disappointing me for GREAT Fries! I was grateful to get my order fairly quickly and that is always a plus.
The parking lot needed to a power washing. Why businesses don't clean up the parking lots more often, I don't know. My shoes go from the grease and grime also have to get into my fairly new car as well.
Overall, it was a fair experience. Although, next time I will make use of the drive-thru.<//Review>

<Text>Hate the decor. Prefer the old nostalgia McDonald's started with back in the days it started. Foods just ok and has become too expensive for what it's worth.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x809ad6dca8008d49:0xdd06283234e1bd52</Gmap_id>< date>

Slow service, no refills on coffee. I would suggest going to the next McDonalds down the road. This McDonalds needs a complete remodel from the management to the facilities.  I have never been to such a terrible place.< /text>

I go there around 6:00am.. when I'm in Sacramento California and the girls who work drive thru are so friendly and courteous they usually always put me in a much better mood than when I arrive in Sacramento. Coffee is fabulous too. Great job.</Review>

Always a good time at McDonald's and the discounts are always on point for what I need at the time. People should ease off of how often they come here since I always see the same people there, but I guess that makes me a regular too.< /Text>

<Text>Not friendly staff and they play something that resembles sound and music incredibly loud outide the building.  Please turn that stuff off.
Though a pretty new looking one, very dirty.  Sticky floors everywhere, bathrooms. Dirty.  Also, a lot of homeless people , sad to see folks are all over there.  Some get a little attitude with you.</Text><Rating>1</Rating>< gmapID>

It was not good there were so many homeless people hanging  in front asking for money and food .it's pathetic ! Kind of hard to enjoy your meal when there are cold hungry people standing   in front of you asking for food ..and as far as the food I had coffee which is always good at McDonald's but the Sausage biscuit was hard and very dry  two bites and it went to the trash.
Sorry for the bad review but it was not good ..<//Review>

<user>115963893180866196205</user><text>I'm usually happy with this place. Not happy today when I went in to order. Ordered a kids meal with ketchup, didn't even get ketchup in the box. Went up to trade my kids Barbie and the employee looked through five boxes up front in the drive through area before coming back and saying that the same Barbie was in all the boxes and he couldn't find the one my daughter wanted (the princes Barbie) really?? He didn't even try looking harder or even in the actual box all the toys come in. my daughter was very upset. Thought the saying for all employees in customer service is to go above and beyond for the customer instead of making a three year old cry and pout by barely even searching for a doll? Seriously?<//text><Rating>3</Rating>< time>

<username>Kimberly Hicks<//username><text>I finally used an order kiosk instead of standing in the line with 5 customers before me. I only ordered a soda, so I thought a counter server would call out to give me my cup, but no, I waited and watched the 5 customers order at the counter and get their food and 3 more who arrived after me and ordered at the counter and 2 of those already had their food before my number was called out and I was handed my cup.<//text>< date>

Most mismanaged place I've seen in my life. Asked for two simple burgers with no cheese and they messed up. Turned around to get them remade, and the associates not only ignored me, but someone told the the cashier to go on lunch when 3 people were in line with no replacement for her. After ignoring me and taking the guest's order that was behind me in line, they finally remade my order. Which was wrong again and had cheese.< /Text>

This is an amazing restaurant. They operate like many other McDonald's, however they also have a population of homeless folks in the area. They have found a great balance with serving their customers and managing the needs of their homeless patrons as well. The restaurant is always clean and well stocked with supplies. Great Job!< /Review>

<Text>Quick and polite service but other than that this location definitely has its challenges. Very dirty restaurant and not well maintained. Many people come in off the streets and panhadle customers while they are eating while the employees just watch. A lot of yelling outside and no security present. Definitely recommend Drive Thru if you must visit this location. Otherwise the Downtown location is a short drive away.< /Text>< gmapID>

< Review>
McDonald's is an American classic they've been around for over 60 years and then menu hasn't changed very much which I like burgers are always great and tasty the size of salt he's just like I like them. For a quick bite to eat you can't go wrong at McDonald's there's a reason they've been around so long and I'm pretty sure they'll be around even longer<//Review>

This is not the cleanest of McDonald's I have been to, but the structure feels new and I like the self order stations.

Quite a few homeless folks hang out within the vicinity, but that is probably a "downtown" characteristic.

Food is standard. Workers seem courteous.</Text>

Chicken tenders were hot. Problem was you have to wait 15 minutes for them. This happened on more than one occasion.<//Text>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>Located at the intersection of Richards Blvd and Bercut Drive, this McDonalds has come a long way in just a short year. I've been dining here every now and then for 3 years, when the craving for nugs hits, and believe me when I say 4 stars is rightly earned. Customer service is great, the dining area is kept clean, and the electronic kiosks help the flow of traffic. I won't mince words and ignore the homeless situation, that just like most parts of our city this McDonalds had its fair share. But they took steps and are once more comfortable to eat at. As far as food goes, they never had a problem with what they served, nor with how good the stuff tasted. Order what you will, it's McDonalds so I won't say what is my favorite *coughmcchickencough*</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>THE WORST!! I already don't like McDonald's... Accept when I order fries with no salt, just to make sure I get fresh cooked, hot fries. But we took the kids here and the food was disgusting! We got there about 9:45 and it took the kids dang near 15 minutes to order through the kiosk menu in the restaurant. Then the employee comes over and says... You are going to have to get your order to go cuz we are closed!  I said we have been in the restaurant ordering. She just walked away. The burgers were cardboard, the fries were cold and hard, and they only way they were edible was drenched in a milkshake! Lol. (apparently the kids like that). The "crispy" chicken on the salad was old, cold, shriveled up, and very dark. This place is for people with no taste buds and very poor standards. Kids will eat almost anything and even they were throwing this food in the TRASH WHERE IT BELONGED. WE SPENT $50 on food that ended up in the TRASH!! And the only reason we didn't go back. And complain and make them cook it over is because they were already rude and closed. Probably would have done something NASTIER to the food.<//text>< Pics>

<text>Terrible. I made an order they forgot a bunch of stuff and I go back to get it and they were rude as can be about the 2 cheese burgers I ordered that were missing and 3 medium fries I know I ordered at the drive through. They tried recharging me for what was missing on my receipt and had no sympathy for screwing up dinner with my family while we were on vacation. They also gave me a double quarter with one patty that I had to return as well. I'm filing a huge corperate complaint. No wonder why this place is 3 stars. I'll be getting my coin back one way or another.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

This place was dirty, stuff all over the floor, drink station was sticky and looked like it hasn't been properly cleaned in weeks. Employees were loud and rude, when they even bothered to acknowledge their customers. They also forgot part of my order so I had to go back to get it. I'll never stop at this location again, if I could I'd give zero stars.< /Review>

Lobby dirty at 1130AM crew members were rude and unprofessional. Order was wrong and when i politely told cashier what the issue was she rolled her eyes and said next time order right the 1st time. I said i did order right to begin with. Maybe u need to clean ya ears out n listen to the customer without attitude the 1st time. Now refund me my money and take this order back.<//review>

Service was quick, pleasant and the food was hot and juicy! I've been ordering the Quarter Pound Deluxe - which is nothing but the McDLT from back in the '90s - early 2000's. The addition of mayo,ketchup, pickles, onions transforms the Quarter Pounder into a juicy cheeseburger you'd get from larger restaurants. This store us actually one of the best in Natomas/North&West Sacramento</Review>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>It's actually a very nice McDonald's... in a popular area for the homeless, I mean "unhoused." The manager and staff are friendly. Bathrooms for customers only. Generally enough parking for a pickup truck and trailer, on a big corner lot.
2 McDoubles for $3.50 (plain) are a favorite of the pitties.  They know sit, shake... McDonald's.</Review>< pictures>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Review>Went to a different McDonalds before and got a 6 piece chicken nugget happy meal. Normally, I would eat a 10 piece but every time a new toy display comes out. I gotta get a happy meal. Sadly after I ate my food, even though it was a small portion. I got an explosive diarrhea after. I won't blame you for this. The quality of the food is overall great. It's just that sometimes, my stomach gets messed up after eating junk food which is normal. I may be sometimes intolerant to sugar or salt. Otherwise, great customer service and good food 😊👍🏻<//Review>< pics>

This morning I went through the drive thru. I had about 9 cars in front of me but it went fastser than I expected. Infact when I pulled up to window #1 to pay for my meal the person handed me a 90 second glass timer to give to the person in window # 2. She said if the timer runs out and I dont have my food I get a coupon for a free meal or something. I got my meal on time. But honestly I feel bad going here because there's so many homeless people around. I wish I could buy them all breakfast.</review>

<Text>This was the worst McDonald's I've ever stepped foot into. The floors and tables were filthy, the service was so slow. I was so shocked that I turned around and left after waiting 8  minutes for someone to approach the register and help the person in front of me. Never have I seen such a McDonald's in all my years.

If you don’t mind eating nano particles mixed in with the special blend, special formed “chicken nuggets” and you love those 100% “Beef”patties(!100% beef Parts is still 100% Beef right?!)
Then this is the place for you ! If you’re a grown adult go for it, but don’t do that to your children. They trust in you and your ability’s to know good from bad. It’s time for people to Wake Up . You and your family’s lives depend on it!

<Review>Usually good but this was the "night crew" with obviously a lack of responsible supervision. The drive thru staff was obnoxious talking loud back and forth to each other about non McDonald's related things and the fries were underserved(for $3 I expect a large fry to be filled up to top) and the bun on my big mac was hard in a spot. Very irritated. Ghetto employees and lack of supervision.<//Review><Name>Jadrew Scrapper< /Name><Gmap_id>0x809ad6dca8008d49:0xdd06283234e1bd52< /Gmap_id><rating>2< /rating><UserId.>105831316995422624990</UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Text>You give your employees an inadequate amount of breaks!!! They are not slaves they are EMPLOYEES, do not confuse the two. If I could give this rating a 0 I would but it only allows 1 star and you don’t even deserve that. I am not at ease with the way you treat your employees (my boyfriend in particular) and if this problem is not attempted to be solved I will sue.< /Text>< Pictures>

Stopped in to get fries. Every single person in that place is rude AF!!! Seriously, I know you hate the world because you dropped out of school, smoke weed and are so sadly unemployable, but it's not my fault. Those homeless guys out front would probably love to have your job. So if you can't put a smile on your face, well at least say, "Hello!" For God's sake!!!!< /Text>

<Review>This McDonald's literally is the slowest McDonald's in the history of McDonald's i waited 20+ minutes for two sausage egg mcmuffins. The system they have there is rediculous. This is why i don't eat fast food its really slow food.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x809ad6dca8008d49:0xdd06283234e1bd52<//GmapID></record>

Service and food is always good but this is the local hangout for a lot of homeless. Be aware of your surroundings.< /Review>

<response>None< /response><Text>Terrible service and wait time. I knew the moment they took my order I was going to have difficulty. They rushed me through and never asked my drink or sauce with my chicken nuggets, I had to cstch them at the end of their statement of cost to get a word in that I wanted no ice and what sauce I wanted, which was supposedly taken but the receipt showed they weren't paying attention at all. Wrong drink, wrong sauce. The staff were particularly rude about their own mistake and gave me grief the whole way through me correcting their order, promptly forgetting to give me a straw and demanding I give the correct order from now on. Like I know it's McDonald's I am not expecting 5* menu and service but damn did this McDonald's have no class.</Text>< gmapID>

I got a coffee in the morning, feel asleep and when I woke up it was gone! I didn't even take a sip. Then I ordered another one. When I got done drinking it, I went to get a refill and they refused!! So then I asked for hot water so I could brew sone tea. They would only give me the smallest coffee cup of water and told me if I wanted more that I would have to pay for it!!! Bout the only thing good about the place is that they allowed me to loiter for a couple hours, there are too many homeless degenerates around<//Review>

<Review>This location can be crowded during lunch or on weekends because of its proximity to the river. It also has quite a homeless population hanging around. They suffer from the occasional oddball staff member. Having said that, the staff is nice and you can tell that they make a huge effort to provide great service and a facility.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Always an interesting place.  For dine-in they give the number on the receipt aswell as a delivery number to srt on the table.  So I ask "will the good be delivered to the table?" Yes, they said. So I sat & sat with no food delivered.  It was on the counter, they were calling the other number.  Not sure what the table number was for.  A lot of the time the don't have what you want on the menu.  How can you not be able to serve coffee drinks at 6am or 10pm? There's a wide variety of excuses but it's all the same.  This style of service has existed at this McDonald's for many years and they are in no hurry to change.  Best to use a different McDonald's.  Oh, there's also a high level of homeless in the area.  They use a security guard but it is still eye opening.</text>

Usually pretty quick service. I just can't remember the last time I went there and the damn ice cream machine was working. Sometimes all a girl wants is some nuggets and a caramel sundae. Is that too much to ask Mr. Ronald McDonald, is it?! 😂</text>

If there is anything that's not great, it's the location.

It's okay, can't complain! This location is always crowded so usually when I dine in it's dirty tables and trash everywhere but like I said they are always crowded. The workers are nice, great customer service a little slow but not rude and so far very friendly.</Review>

This location is the absolute best when it comes to FRESH fast food. Everything is always hot. The staff is friendly and fast. If there is anything that's not great, it's the location. Easy on/off of I-5 in both directions and super close to work; however, the homeless population is a problem because they hit you up coming in, going out, and sitting in the drive-thru. I don't mind helping them out once in a while, but multiple times while in line is a bit much.< /Text>

<text>I, pregnant security officer, was denied to use the restroom. I walk in to ask to use the restroom at 510am and they said No.

I was pretty flabbergasted. I waited until they open. It's pretty upsetting when a baby is pressing on your blander. Beside that, I was ready to order food but their system was not up and ready. I was disappointed with them. Clearly they are not ready to open at 5am. Poor time management.< /text>< pics>

The food was not up to par at all the fries were really dark in the oil needs to be changed in the fires obviously they were really busy at the time nobody took concern to look at that. They replaced the french fries for me when I brought them back to the counter the rest of the food was mediocre if anything's can understand they were little pressed and busy at the time but all-in-all you still have the establishment you posed to keep a certain standards for and they fell through this time.</Text>

Bought Quarter Pounders through the drive-thru started eating them realize we didn't get our drinks, went back in to get my drinks. one of the workers asked me if I ordered my burger that way, I hadn't really even looked, when I looked at it it was bloody. Got the manager a middle-aged Hispanics Latino gentleman and he basically tried everything he  could to make me feel like a piece of trash. as if I didn't order that from him, digging through receipts back there. I am bothered that I ate blood and I'm also bothered that I was rudely treated by management I wonder if I can sue< /review>

Been there three times in the last week and they never have any sodas hooked up to the machine. You get water or carbonated water. 2/3 times the service was horrible. The food was fresh the 3rd time I went.<//text>

<Text>This McDonald's is the worst.... Even the manager can not pick up the phone when you call in, to tell them the food you just got through the drive was cold and I mean cold!!!!  I have been going here awhile because it's convenient and the service has not change.. matter fact it's getting worse, so maybe the manager should step up and get things on the right track! Or maybe get rid of the manager!!!!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It's McDonald's what can you say. You can't beat the dollar Iced Teas or the double cheeseburgers. That's about all that I really like here</Review>

Normally I would rate McDonalds a little higher, solely because I love their mocha frappes.  But this location had an extremely high percentage of homeless people inside and outside, with one acting very erratically.  Very unnerving.</review>

Been a while since i've been inside to Order MacDonald's so to my surprise to discover No Longer do Customers place Orders@ the Main Counter but on a Kiosk then pay @ the Counter. I  Now Am Convinced that if This is what  working Fast food is worthy of 15.00 an hour is a Shame.</Review>

This location is AWFUL! You can't get in without walking past a bunch of drunks, you walk inside and they are all over the dining room too. I went through the drive thru to avoid it and as soon as I pull up to the window they tell me they are waiting on fries and have me go park. I waited 10 minutes and went inside where I was met by the rudest manager EVER, who tells me YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WAITING, WE ARE WAITING ON YOUR STRIPS. I  told him that they had told me I was waiting on fries. He goes and scoops the fries and puts them in the bag and walks away. 10 minutes later, I walk up to the counter and say, I HOPE THESE ARENT MY FRIES, I DIDNT PAY $50 TO EAT COLD FOOD, he says no, they arent cold, sticks my strips in the bag and walks off. I wait for him to walk back, 30 minutes have now passed. I told him this situation and his attitude were unacceptable and he just said SORRY and walks away again. I will NOT go back.< /Review>

There's two lines to order and apparently it's only one employee taking your order and rushing you. Mc Donald's should have another menu board so you can have your order ready so when you get up to the speaker and the second menu board you have your order ready.<//review>

< Review>
Manager gave away my meal to a different car while I had my baby with me having places to go to before work so had to wait 45 more mins for them to re make my meal and on top of that I get home with my meal missing some ingredients in the burgers and yet I called they did not want to replace my meal when other mc Donald’s places have given me the same meal I get for free the next time I go. Worst location to go to manager doesn’t do his work right.</Review>

Not going here anymore, two employee's are very rude and one was arguing with me of how wrong i was about their drive thru menu being wrong on display. Says 2 mcmuffins for like $3 and i was told I'm wrong when it clearly shows on the menu. So i guess this McD's only hires rude argumentive employee's telling it costumers they are wrong. Nice going management.<//text>

<Text>This location is AWFUL! You can't get in without walking past a bunch of drunks, you walk inside and they are all over the dining room too. I went through the drive thru to avoid it and as soon as I pull up to the window they tell me they are waiting on fries and have me go park. I waited 10 minutes and went inside where I was met by the rudest manager EVER, who tells me YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WAITING, WE ARE WAITING ON YOUR STRIPS. I  told him that they had told me I was waiting on fries. He goes and scoops the fries and puts them in the bag and walks away. 10 minutes later, I walk up to the counter and say, I HOPE THESE ARENT MY FRIES, I DIDNT PAY $50 TO EAT COLD FOOD, he says no, they arent cold, sticks my strips in the bag and walks off. I wait for him to walk back, 30 minutes have now passed. I told him this situation and his attitude were unacceptable and he just said SORRY and walks away again. I will NOT go back.< /Text>< Pics>

< review>
The bathrooms were beyond dirty. There was a que of homeless people in line for food, some with McDonald's cards. We left extra cash for the ones without enough money, but the next person in line, who, though amazingly unclean, was quietly ordering when a manager came over and refused to let him order. Though the shop is located in a difficult spot, their meanness and lack of cleanliness was very upsetting. We had to wait a long time for our food and I became increasingly anxious to go. Not a good McDonald's experience.< /review>

They are alright. They're an awesome team of people in a completely sh*ty neighborhood. They try and keep their facilities as clean as they possibly can considering all the homeless people who come in and either are on drugs or have mental Issues.these people put up with alot.. thats why I gave them 4 stars... Truly at best Its a 2 star joint... And that's stretching it< /Text>

The reason I give a Mc. Donalds five stars is that there are automated machines that take your order. A major advancement in fast food is in this restaurant, in particular.<//Text>

they r rude to the unhealthy people that live around here. like they r a nobody.  even me at times.  and I witnessed the male manger talking about people and the employees following along and it's both Spanish and English. I didn't appreciate it..i did say something at the time.  a manager is a role model for employees. so he needs to be retrained also.  other then that. food is ok.  timely service is not. some customers waiting up to 15 mins for just a cheeseburger. . not kool.<//text>

Fast and friendly, clean, good quality; which was unexpected as it seemed a bit shrouded in vagrants.< /text>

Horrible employees I was kicked out they wouldn't allow my companion dog to accompany me just to grab something to go and I even had proof of him being a service animal but he wasn't allowed yet they allow homeless people to just chill in there and beg for food. My dog doesn't even do that he was working and they wouldn't allow him to work!!< /Text>

The staff here was very nice. The only problem with this place was the location and the crowd that hangs out around the bus stop out front. I would eat here again, though.<//Text>

Too many flies, most of staff poorly trained, stank attitudes, No care or pride in what they are doing, absolutely no customer service skills, No one ever smiles. The only reason I return is McDonald's food is available eatable, and inexpensive, also there are two staff members that are always polite, professional and courteous. Ms. Janet, and Young  Tyrisha. These two staff members display the customer service that I've groan to Love . I think Ms. Janet is a manager. She is patient and willing to make things right and the customer feel respected satisfied when they leave. Ms Tyrisha is a counter clerk and a large smile is on her face no matter the customer. yes even to the homeless...these two staff members should be the ones that train all current employees and future...

Drive thru is slow and somehow, no matter which lane I choose, the other goes faster and 2-3 people that pulled in after me end up getting ahead of me.  Picking a lane is like gambling. I don't have time to keep returning to have it fixed because I am on my lunch break and I already spent 20+ minutes in the drive thru. I had not eaten McDonald's in over 3 years and the only reason I started again because it is the only food place near my work. After experiencing poor service the overwhelming majority of times, I regret ever giving this company my business and will never do so again. If you go there, check your order thoroughly. I mean unwrap burgers and everything (especially if you had any special orders).<//Text>< resp>

I was there at 7pm after a long drive and mcd was at a waking distance from my hotel, as soon as I came in, I   notice that most of the tables were taken by all this people not consuming and using the WiFi. I set there eat my meal and 100% of the few customers that came in, would order to go. As for the cleanliness,  the clean up bouquet was right next to the front counter,  the place looked clean but the same water bucket was use to clean the restrooms and the main floor. I do not know if the same situation happens during the day, either way, as tier as I was, I would drive to the other side of town for a meal.</Review>< pics>

<text>Hi I have just noticed your public relations manager replied to my trip advisor review but I am sorry it's not good enough. I have sent 3 emails to your hotel after YOUR hotel phoned my partner Mitchell Boyle to apologise for our stay quite soon after we had returned from your hotel. Andrew phoned him and apologised and said we would be offered a free nights stay to make up for it especially as it was two couples anniversary and after everything that had happened during our stay. My friend that was also there phoned last Wednesday and spoke to the manager that said full refunds would be made and a free night at the hotel with dinner, bed and breakfast but again nothing. So upset that we were willing to return and give you a second chance but it was only words and false promises. Such a shame cos you have a lovely hotel and most of the staff have a hard time dealing with customers due to their stay here and the service. If this was my hotel and I was reading this I would be incredibly embarrassed. Please make this hotel better or else you will have no customers<//text></record></dataset><record>

Shittiest service by terrible employees. Don't go here. Your order will be wrong, they cant handle a rush, and they won't take your order until you drive up to the window. This is the worst location.< /text>

If you're going to this McDonalds to use the internet don't go they say on the door free Wi-Fi but then they tell you you have to purchase something there to use it. And they have very poor service they do not step on their burgers worst McDonalds ever terrible horrible + the area is overtaken by homeless people</review>

Took a long time to get food. Plus they shorted by friend 81 cents because the triple triple is programmed wrong in their computer so it charges more than $3 like advertised. Check your receipts.<//text>

<Text>I went through the drive thru it took me 10 minutes with five cars in line.  it has to be the slowest McDonalds Drive thru ever. I'm not sure I'll go back here. Drive through the parking lot was very littered with trash very dirty place can only imagine how dirty it is inside the restaurant.< /Text><Time>1456458771592< /Time></record></dataset><record>

Worst place to spend your money in Sacramento. Staff there are extremely disrespectful. I was stuck in one of the drive thru lanes waiting to order for 15 minutes while 7 cars went through the other lane, then when I reach the first window to pay I asked the gentleman what the hold up was with my lane he stated,"do you want the food or not" then refused to serve me. People like that are the reason crazy things happen at these kind of place.</review>

You might as well order medium because the fries are always short, i got my meal wrong today the lady looked like she needed sleep, anyway the drive thrus usually serve people constantly depending what time u come seems the employs cant handle it or should be trained more i dont know and dont care because i would not spend good money there; corporate needs to look into this, i have ate mcdonalds all my life and this just isn't right.< /Text>

<review>AVOID ...this location. Homeless , homeless everywhere ...outside, inside just staring or asking for money. It's a sad fact of the area, yea, but your manager needs to complete their travelpaths through their lobby so that your customers don't get constantly harassed before even getting to the counter!? .  I won't be back until it gets cleaned up!<//review><username>Todd Montclair</username></record></dataset><record>

Really bad service from the cashier young black girl, I understand some times we have a bad day, but you need to leave the problems in your car or house, but I don't know if the other people are friendly, but I had a really bad experience, sorry for the owner.....<//review>
