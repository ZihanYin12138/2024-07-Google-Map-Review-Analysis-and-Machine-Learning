<Text>Every time I've been to capital city loan I'm greeted and helped so fast. I recently went in and seen a chain I really liked so I asked to see it. I was helped by Cecilia and Bryan and they were very helpful and professional telling me about the merchandise. I buy my jewelry, shoes, and other little cool items All the time here. Great service and deals too. Thanks again for your help and service Cecilia and Bryan.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Tony is amazing. They helped me with what I needed, they never let it bother them that my transactions kept them well over closing time. They kept me laughing and I have to say, the most entertainment since COVID-19 started. I will be back to purchase more as their selection is fantastic. Great quality products and the jewelry, AMAZING! I’m a forever customer!</Text><Date>1617933445662<//Date></record></dataset><record>

At capital City Loans & jewelry  II on Fruitridge,  one man in particulates his name is joe, I think his ID # is 1106. He was very kind and he was knowledgeable about almost everything I  was curious about. I took a long time looking but that didn't seem to bother him but I did buy a gps with  a stand and cord charge, for my car and he helped me to unstoo how it works   He  was so friendly.  I loved his accent  ,his voice really calm and smoothing.  He said that he had an speech impairment . I love the way he talk and his helpful nature  and attitudes. Thank you  joe  from A satisfying customer</text>

Worst customer service and most exspensive prices with  firearms that I have ever experienced. Waited a 1/2 hour to look at a .33 caliber rifle, and nobody even asked if I needed help. If you want fantastic customer service with a great price go to River City Gun Exchange. You will be happy you did.< /review>

<review>Very friendly staff. Greeted by 3 different Associates. Bryan gave excellent service.
Been using this facility and my best banjo to get by for the last couple years. Hopefully, last time. Social Security in October!  Who am I kidding? See ya in 6 months!

I’ve come to this pawn shop for about a decade.
Friendly customer service and you’ll get a good price for a pawn/loan. I like buying merchandise from here and I save money 💰💰💰 ask for José</text>

Aron was so helpful while I shopped for jewelry. He patiently and kindly showed me everything I asked to see. He let me take photo's and even modeled the rings for me. He was friendly helpful with his price negotiation and working with me on a great deal.
I love a deal and Capital City Loan and Jewelry is the place to find it! they have a wish list program also, so if they don't have it in their store but you want it they go looking for the item you want and call YOU when they find it at the price you want to pay!! that's what I call great service....
While I came looking for a gift for my fiance I found a something much nicer than I even expected to find and at an Awesome price!<//Review>

Customer service was great. TJ took good care of what I needed. I was looking for a necklace and I showed a couple of them. So instead of one I was looking for I walked out with 3 and I was very pleased. Thanks again and I will be back.</Text>

I was greeted in a timely fashion as well as assisted from start to finish even though I bought 1 item and then saw something I was interested in and something more. TJ was the rep that assisted me and was knowledgeable of the products your store had on the shelves< /review>

The manager is a crook . he basically played me into buying a macbook pro that does not even hold a charge.  Basically trying to sell it for high  .atleast let it work he really tricked me into believing it worked i guess he thought because i was a woman i didnt know anything.  . and he claims he is the one who makes the prices for electronics .Dont waste your time or money .<//Text>

For the most part, the employees are friendly. I think they are fine to go to for Gold, but if you wanna sell silver, you might take a loss. Like with any pawn shop, they pay more for what sells most.<//text>

This was my first time getting an eye exam and the girl who did my eye exam was Danielle and she was so nice. She explained everything that she was doing so that I would feel comfortable. She even helped me look for glasses after. I would highly recommend going to Stanton to get your eye exam and glasses!<//review>

Do NOT go to the Clovis Stanton Optical!!! I went in December and had (2) different Doctors examine me with two different prescriptions and (8) different pairs of glasses and eyesight was still blurry at every turn. Wanted a refund and after 6 months - yes (6) months I finally got my money returned! Oh yea and I fell down- should’ve sued
Do yourself a favor DONT GO! & there Corporate Headquarters are a bunch of quacks located in Palm Beach Florida wow! They are a JOKE

<Text>I normally never leave reviews on businesses, but due to the poorest service I received today in my the Clovis location, I had to leave a comment. This is the first and last time I would ever go to this business. I went to the Clovis location and the staff there except for 1 employee was terrible. No acknowledgement, no eye contact because they’re afraid if they acknowledge you, they’re going to have to actually work. My appointment was at 2:25 p.m. and didn’t get any help until 3 p.m. The guy that was helping me had a runny nose and wouldn’t  blow it. Gross! Not only that, I left about 3:30p.m. To just get the lens replaced. He told me that it was going to take 1 hour to fix and they’ll call me when it’s done. I never received a call. I called around 5:30 p.m. to check on the status and the call center couldn’t even get through to the local store to confirm for me if it was done. Awful!!! I ended going into the store myself before closing and when I went in, there was no one in the lobby to help. This is the worst business and customer service I’ve received in a long time. Don’t go here for service. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Customer service over the phone and in person is horrible. The only good part of this visit was the eye exam. Over the phone the customer service told us they accepted our insurance (which is a major insurance company PPO) in store we were told another story. Our “salesman” Eddie, looked like he just woke up from a nap in a sauna, and was equally unhelpful and confused. After spending 2 hours at the store (at closing time) we parted ways with Eddie agreeing that he would contact our insurance the next day Saturday) or Monday at the latest and call me with the new information from my insurance that he was guessing was right on Friday evening. After attempting to call the store on Monday and not getting anyone at the store to answer I was transferred to customer service who also could not get anyone to answer the phone at the store. This repeated itself everyday until the following Friday, and I finally got someone to answer the phone. They told me Eddie didn’t make any notes on my exam and he will be available in 2 hours. 4 hours later, I called 15 times in a row until someone answered the phone. The sales manager told me there’s nothing they could do for me, and I should go to another optician. Thanks Stanton I will do that.</review></record></dataset><record>

Went in during rush hour, so took bit longer than expected. But they made sure to check up on customers often and were very nice! Great deals too -- if you've got the time and don't mind the wait, definitely worth it! Mitzi assisted us and she was very nice and attentive!< /Review>

<Review>Went in with an outside prescription Mitzi was so knowledgeable and wonderful to deal with superb Customer Service. Took in my own frame along with purchasing a complete pair of glasses. The top lenses for my high prescription were given to me hence the sky high price others wanted to charge me .

Great experience! It was my first time visiting this location and I am very happy with the service. I was helped by Mario and April. Both of them were very bubbly and friendly. It was definitely the best service I've received for an eye exam. In addition, everything felt clean and organized. I can see myself returning to this location in the future.</Review>

We loved the service and experience at Stanton Optical in Clovis. We were helped by Mitzi! She was very sweet, personable, knowledgeable, and kind when guiding us (my 8yo son) in the process of picking the right glasses for him. Will definitely recommend this place, and come back again in the future! :)</Review>

Stanton Clovis is the place to go. The eye exam was very thorough for me and they have a good frame selection. I can't wait to receive my glasses. Although we were all wearing masks, you can hear it in their voice that they were happy to help. Thank you Mitzi for your great service.< /Review>

If you want to get exposed to covid feel free to stop by the Stanton, I went in for eye exam and the manager was very ill, complete disregard to us. I myself suffer from allergies so I understand and get it how people may react around this time of year but her symptoms were beyond allergies and she had the nerve to try and lie saying she had only sinus pressure. I could clearly hear in her voice how Ill she was and she would rush to the back and start coughing and clearing her throat of flem. My station was sanitized before I began but the person performing my exam didn’t bother or offer to sanitize after the  manager was coughing as she went passed us into back room. I shared my concern and she basically just shrugged me off and just kept talking about her pregnancy. Afterwards honestly didn’t feel comfortable buying anything there or trying anything on. Turns out u can just pay $45 for your eye exam and buy glasses online.

I almost felt like asking her to check her own temp, if they have thermometers for customers they should probably use them on themselves aswell. No doubt in my mind she was running a fever.  Is Stanton optical even making their employees test anymore?< /text>

<text>This was the best Stanton experience I've had. Always a good experience but the Clovis team has been the best. So helpful  and friendly. Mitzi in particular had the best customer service that felt caring instead of sales person-ish. And always felt safe with their COVid safety measures. If you need an contact exam or glasses, definitely go there!!</text>< pics>

I have been wearing glasses since I was 5 years old and the experience that I had today at the Stanton Optical location in Clovis with Sales Manager, Mitzi Ruiz, was the best I've ever had!  She is amazing!  I had just picked up my new glasses two weeks ago and I went in with some concerns I had been having with them.  She listened to all of my issues/concerns and MADE things right.  She is so nice and very personable as well.  I just can't say enough great things about her.  That girl deserves a raise!  Thank you Mitzi and thank you Stanton Optical!</Text>

< review>
If you can wait at least 3 weeks for your glasses the staff is great here but unfortunately if your glasses break don't come here it will be a while. They will tell you 7 to 10 business days but in reality you looking at at least 3 weeks.

Update: i called this morning to make sure my glasses were ready for pick up and I was told my glasses were ready. I go down there to pick them up and  of course only 1 of them are ready. When i asked to speak with a manager she was unfortunately clocking out. My eye appointment was on the 8th its now the 2nd this is ridiculous and I would definitely recommend shopping elsewhere.</review>

Great experience! Staff is polite and very helpful. The store is clean, organized, and set up in away that makes the process of getting your eye exam to getting your contacts/glasses very efficient. Mitzi helped me out, and I felt very well taken care of and attended to. Wonderful location.<//Review>

Exceptional customer service. Set up an appointment in less than 2 min which was great. When I arrived for my appointment was helped almost immediately after arriving. Mitzi, April, and Jason were amazing. Their positive attitude and bubbly personalities were comforting. As this was my first ever eye exam that I’ve had they were very informative, and easy to talk to. I was also fitted for contact lenses and they were helpful on how to apply them to the eye safely and easily. Definitely a great choice in optical establishments. My go to store hands down. Thank you Mitzi, April, and Jason you guys were awesome. Also leaving same review on Yelp.<//Review>

I called to make sure that this place carried toddler glasses, they ensured me that they did.  I booked an appointment for later that day, had my husband miss the last 3 hours of work to care for out other children.  I arrive at the appointment and no one was there to meet us.  I informed them of my appointment and  was told that I would still have to wait in line. So what was the point of making an appointment?  I then asked to see the toddler glasses and was told that they do not carry them.  I called the number where I had originally scheduled and was placed on hold for over 11 minutes.  At that point I just hung up and I google searched other places that might carry toddler prescription glasses.  Luckily I found a wonderful mom and pop place with excellent service.

I do not recommended Stanton Optical.  My husband lost 3 hours of work, they wasted my time and I found them to be extremely unprofessional.  If you value your time and want customer service this is not the right place for you.</review>

I give this location 5 stars because not only was it neat and clean. I was the only costomer at the time which made it really nice during this pandemic. Mitzi took care of me through my appointment and made me feel very comfortable. Great costomer service, was attentive and super friendly. She gave me an amazing deal, thank you again Mitzi! My husband and i will definitly be back for more pairs 👍<//text>

It's been a year since I last purchased from here but I would not recommend this place, you're better off going to Walmart vision center if you're on a budget because they're pretty much the same price. At the time I thought that having a doctor exam you through a monitor was because of COVID but nope I guess that's something they've always been doing, I should've walked out then. My salesman was also really pushy he even tried to run my credit for down payments without my permission. What is this, a car dealership? I should've walked out then but was in need of some new glasses and thought maybe their glasses will be fine despite my pushy salesman. After wearing my glasses for a few days my vision became blurry and my head felt dizzy, pretty normal for adjusting to new glasses right? Fast forward a few weeks and it's still the same. Fast forward a few months and it's still the same. I eventually just gave up on them. The glasses that I purchased for over 400 dollars were completely unwearable and a waste of my money. Only good thing about this place was their nice frames and the nice hispanic lady, other than that you're better off going to an actual eye doctor, or Walmart for the same price, or a car dealership for pushy salesman lol.</Text>

<Text>This place have become unAmerican and nothing like it use to be. This place caters to non-English speaking people. I went Monday and was first in line waited for a long time but when a non-English speaking family came and stood behind me they were noticed immediately, a foreign guy wearing a white coat uniform came,  took their temperatures and assisted them first. The workers here could use more orientation classes on how to treat all people with respect and fairness. Coming here ruined my day. This place use to be tidy and clean.

This place is a waste of time. After my eye exam for contacts it took them MONTHS...just to get my *TRIALS* in. When I asked for a refund the manager offered me a $90 credit towards contacts instead. When I attempted to place an order with said credit they wanted to act like they didn’t know what I was talking about, no such credit was offered, that person doesn’t work here anymore Ect etc! They’ll also try to sell you on disposables and say it’s better to use in re to pandemic but actually it’s because they cost 4x more. In fact, with my pair of monthly trials they switched the L and R...hoping to prompt me to prefer the disposables but I could *see* through that BS! So dishonest!!   Do not trust them with your time, money and vision! DECEPTIVE DISHONEST BUSINESS< /text>

I walked in and was greeted kindly and promptly. Although I saw there were a few patients waiting, I was still seen in a timely manner! After the initial eye exam, Jason did an amazing job helping me choose frames; he was patient with me and gave me very honest opinions! He had turned my already good experience into an exceptional one, and I can definitely say I would recommend this location to everyone! Thank you x9000 Jason; stay awesome! ✨</Review>

<Review>Mitzi was very helpful during my eye exam. She was very kind and patient because there was 2 other people waiting while I was there. Jason helped me pick my glasses out. He was funny and sweet and didn’t lie when I asked for his opinion. I LOVE my glasses. Thank you guys!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Positive reviews on here must be fake. When you have a problem and receive a reply from the owner to call you will never reach him/her. You'll be put on hold for 10-15 minutes and hung up on each-time. This is the most unprofessional business I've ever dealt with.<//Text>

<Review>I had a really great experience here. I booked the appointment online and was seen on time as requested by the doctor (via xoom). Prices were explained and broken down which are simple and very affordable. They offer a buy one get one with lenses/frames . The frame selection was a bit smaller than I thought it would be.. That would be my only complaint but maybe it's probably due to COVID , not even their fault. Jason helped me all throughout. He was very polite and well-practiced. I look forward to picking up my glasses in a week or so<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>10/30-I received a call that BOTH my eyeglasses have arrived & ready for pick up Stanton-Clovis. I went after work about 4pm, told the CSR (NO NAME tag) that I received a call to pick up both my eyeglasses. She said "only 1 has arrived & the other 1 will take a out a week or 2". I replied "I'm disappointed I was not given ACCURATE info but whatever I'll be back. CSR replied "you will get a call when your other lens arrives" (that never happened). I called friday 11/6 & asked if my lens were in. The CSR (over the phone) said it's at Stanton Clovis since thursday (still disappointed). Again, after work 11/9 I went to pick up my lens, however the progressive lens on both glasses was NOT working for me. So I told Mitzi (she recommended "PROGRESSIVE") that I'm not adjusting to the PROGRESSIVE prescription & would like it removed from BOTH lens and get refunded or credited after I paid $355 total. She said will call her GM to see what they can do because they do not credit or refund. Now irritated! Asked her to have him call me & if I can't get a refund/credit for removing PROGRESSIVE feature than I would like a full refund & I'll get my prescription lens elsewhere. Mitzi said she will call me 11/10/20 after she talks with her GM. After this experience I am not sure of this place #noglasses👓🕶😔

10/16 -
I'm very happy & satisfied to say I had the BESTEST service with my eye exam.

I’m giving a 5 star review for CLOVIS, CA location. I am extremely happy with the customer service they provided. I am specifically going to mention the manager Amy. She took her time, educated me a bit on my insurance plan, and even helped me out to pick out the best looking glasses for me. I wouldn’t go anywhere else if you’re looking for an outstanding service and people who are actually happy to help you.</text>

I got to work with Mitzi for the majority of the process. Amazing person. Has the patience with me through out the whole process and very personable. She took the time to make sure I was 100% Happy with the purchase of my two first ever glasses. The entire staff works great together. Absolutely happy I made the choice to make that my very first optometry visit.

Need somewhere to visit for comfort, knowledge and to receive a personable visit? This is the location to go to. You will walk out feeling happy about your choice.<//Text>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Text>Bunch if scammers! Website says $99 for contact eye exam and 1st pair of contacts.  When I called to schedule they said the price was $89 - same deal - and got me scheduled quickly. I asked if they price match contacts and they said it's up to the store manager. When I get there the kid with the sideways tabletop haircut with his mask only dangling from 1 ear starts telling me it's only $89 if I buy contacts from them after the exam otherwise its $149. I explained what I was told over the phone and that I'm not committing to buying anything because I dont know their prices. He said he'd check with his manager but usually the best they can do is 20% off the contacts if I purchase a whole year supply and that just depends on what they have in stock or if they have to order them. You'll notice there's NO requirement on their website to purchase contacts from them for their advertised price.  Skip these people and go across the street to Walmart.  Same $89 price for the exam, NO requirement to buy contacts from them but why wouldn't you, they're the cheapest in town!</Text><resp>{'time': 1594306324385, 'text': 'Hello Jennifer,\nWe appreciate you took the time to post the review about the experience that you had in Stanton Optical store, our commitment is to deliver the best service to our patients offering an abroad range of frames with very good deals, we do apologize to hear that we did not fulfill with your need since you was giving a different price for the examination at the moment you visited the location, and we apologize for any inconvenience this experience have caused you, we will absolutely take your opinion into consideration to continue working and giving even better deals, remember that in case you would like us to help in any concern you have, you can give us a call to our customer service line at 888-792-8588 and we will be happy to assist you.'}< /resp></record>

I was at first skeptical of getting contacts anywhere other than an optometrist but considering the deal they had I decided to give Stanton a try. Everything was fine, but red flags began to appear when my “optometrist” was giving my consultation through a monitor. After my consultation I was told my contacts would arrive “in a couple of days”. Fast forward to over a week later and my boxes had finally arrived, cause for celebration right? Wrong. They had actually ordered the wrong magnification for one eye. Simple mistake but it’s been over two weeks and I haven’t received a call about a reorder or anything. I didn’t even receive my prescription for my lenses either, even after asking for it. If you’re on a budget this place will work, but please, do your eyes a favor, if you have decent insurance, go to a reputable optometrist.< /Text>

<time>1603947292318< /time><text>Giorgio's makes the is the best tasting Calzones! I got a Large Combination Calzone, for an affordable price for such a wonderful meal.

The first time my boyfriend came home with a Calzone we fought for the last piece. I was impressed, full, and already had been talking about when he'd take me out to dinner to eat there again. That date was tonight.

Although COVID-19 has made restrictions regarding indoor dining, Giorgio's still serving takeout Pizza and guess what...CALZONES! It was my lucky night!

I also give my thanks and appreciation to the woman who gave such a great experience and we will meet again!

So for everyone reading this while you browse the net looking for a place to eat one night, remember GIORGIO'S! YES! CALZONES! YES!</text><response>None< /response>< pics>

This place adds some much needed comfortable charm to Healdsburg.  The food is delicious and affordable.  The place looks rough around the edges, but I wouldn’t have it any other way.  It feels so comfy in there and kind of like I went back in a time machine to a  Italian place in the late 70s.</review>

< Review>
The place was completely empty when I got there.  I ordered the Chicken Cacciatore.  The meal was great.  Side salad with creamy balsamic was pretty good.  The bread wasn't very good.  Some was hot, some was cold.  Came with cold butter packets which was impossible to spread on the soft bread.  Meal showed up shortly after I finished the salad so the timing was great.  The dish was very par.  Just what I expected, no better or worse.  My friend ordered the Chicken Marsala.  The wine wasn't reduced enough, the mushrooms seemed to be thrown on top as the left no flavor in the sauce, and the marinara seemed over simmered.  We then sat there for 25 minutes after we finished waiting for the waitress to come by.  We were still the only table in the restaurant.  The hostess even walked to every table in the restaurant polishing the glass on the table and didn't bother asking if we needed anything.  I paid the tab without looking and the recipt came back very high.  I asked for the itemized receipt to see the waitress charged us an extra $9.50 for our side salads that came with the meal.  She fixed the error without issue.  It was a mix of good and bad service along with good and bad food.  However, the inability to properly charge us was unacceptable.  Especially for paying $65 for 2 with tip for something I could have had cheaper, with better ingredients, better execution, better service, and about the same price in downtown Healdsburg.< /Review>

<Text>The place is dump city with all dirt from years of construction workers coming in after work for beer and pizza.
The great thing about Giorgio's is the pizza, specifically the sausage, mushroom and olive...that's it, don't order any more than that!   The sausage is house made and full of flavor...old school flavor.
It will bring back memories of your best ever pizza.</Text><rate>5</rate>< date>

<Text>Terrible atmosphere and service. First time we came to this restaurant and the waitress was smoking a cigarette on the porch. We walked into a dark, dirty, carpeted restaurant that looked more like a dive bar than a “family” restaurant. There were only four other people in the restaurant and two waitresses. Took 5 minutes to get water from the waitress now cloaked in cigarette smoke. Waited another 10 minutes and finally walked out without being greeted a second time by either waitress. The two people sitting next to us said they had been waiting an hour for their food. As we walked out we saw the cook sitting down at another table eating. Maybe the food is good but you’d have to get past the disgusting environment, cigarette smell and terrible service to enjoy it. #neveragain<//Text>< gmapID>

Seems like the community supports the restaurant.  The portions are good sized. The servers check on you regularly.  The Italian food seems to be lacking in spices.  Italian food should not be bland.  The garlic bread was seasoned well but the pasta was not.< /review>< Pictures>

Read some good reviews on here and was excited to find good Italian close to home...... unfortunately that’s not at all what we found. The food was marginal at best and the service was horrible. Guess I shouldn’t have been too excited about a place that was completely empty at noon. Thumbs down for this place. Just keep driving into Santa Rosa if you want good Italian and any service at all, go to La Coco’s in old downtown SR.</review>

About a year-and-a-half ago I stopped in this restaurant after a long ride around the country on my scooter from Michigan via Route 66 to the Coast Highway I'd been on the road for about 12 weeks when I happened on this restaurant, needless to say I wasn't smelling good and a tad tattered. I was greeted by the waitresses or servers who I believe we're related to the owner possibly daughters. I was made to feel like family I needed this at this point in my journey. The food was delicious the wine was scrumptious and the company was great. I will be certain to return on my next go around.....< /text>

<Review>To start off with the food was good. How ever the service was terrible. The waitress was awful. It took probably 15 plus minutes to get set down and then probably a half hour for the waitress to come get our order. Another half hour-45 minutes to get food that was not even what we ordered and my husband had to go get drinks himself because the waitress didnt even bring them. The lady who brought us wine was nice and seemed on top of things but other than that and the food it was a terrible experience and I would not reccomend this place.</Review>< username>

We walked in the door and waited at least 10 min to get seated in a place with a half dozen or more open tables.  We only got sat because I went to the bartend r asking for a table.  The food was very slow, it was 30 plus minutes to get our meals.  The attentiveness of the waitress for drink refills was not great but part of that was due to them using small glasses, so refills are needed quickly if you are thirsty.  All in all go someplace else.<//text>

<review>Long, honest review.
I was born and raised in healdsburg Ca, I have been coming to this restaurant with family and friends since I was little. Their Italian cuisine is outstanding. They have tons of pasta, pizza, calzones, lasagna, you name it. The only issue is the quality of the food and the way it’s made depends on their current cook that being said I do enjoy their calzones so much but occasionally someone makes them differently and they just don’t taste right, again not a big issue just honesty.
Drinks are always good, made right there by amazing bar staff. Low staff but very friendly and inviting.
Great place, great food, just wish they had a consistent staff (like cooks).< /review><resp>None</resp><userid>113472960889107320586</userid>< time>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Text>Italian food Americana with pasta dishes, pizza and antipasto.  Veal scalopini slightly over cooked to have tough edges. Good flavored sauce, but needed better portion. Penne pasta served with marinara sauce and vegetables that were nothing memorable.  My son enjoyed his pizza. My daughter had good salad.  A very nice clam chowder that was said to be too thick which I disagree.  Two others had linguine alfredo and loved it. Garlic bread was very tasty just a very small portion for the price. Beer and wine were reasonably priced.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x8084171e1c5d0dfd:0xde1f9bf86672086f</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The wait was long and on top of that they told me it would be ready in a little bit instead of just telling me it would take over an hour. Food was very greasy and bland. I should have just gone to Olive garden. :(< /Text>

This place has amazing pizza. It is a run down little hole in the wall place with slow but very friendly service. They make their own dough, sauce and sassage, and it shows. The pizza was the best I've had in Sonoma county and I have lived here for 10 years.<//text>

<Text>I give them 4.5 stars! I just ate there with my family tonight for the 1st time, I had the Veal Scallopini, my husband had the meat lasagna, dad had the Veal Cutlet Parmigiana, and mom had the Eggplant Parmiagiana. We ordered a side of mushrooms which were amazing! After dinner we ordered dessert and were extremely pleased with not only the taste and portion, but the fact that it is made fresh by the restaurant. I wish their salads include some green leaf lettuce in addition to the iceberg, but the dressings tasted home-made. The servings are a very fair size, especially considering that all the entrees are below $20. They are more expensive than most of their online menus suggest (I think they may just be out of date), but my veal was only $19.50 and worth every penny. The wait staff are super friendly and helpful.Our one and only complaint.... no air conditioning and the main dining room has no ceiling fans either so it can get a bit stuffy and warm. This place is a must eat if you want delicious hometown Italian food.<//Text>< pics>

Foods still amazing and that's why it gets 3 stars, took about an hour for my order to come out, the first two dishes came out within 5-10 minutes of each other, the next took another half hour and mine finally came out about 10 minutes after that. Next time I'll just call in my order and do take out.<//Review>

<review>Hard to believe this place has any good reviews.  The food is very substandard.  I ordered the veal Marsala for $20 expecting a decent meal.  This was like something cooked by an unskilled cafe line cook.  The veal was tough, over cooked, the sauce was like sweet and sour sauce from a bad Chinese restaurant, the bread was so dry I could hardly chew it, the plate for the side salad was so small the salad was falling all over the table.  The only thing that was good was the bottle of Lagunitas Sumpin.</review>< pics>

Don't judge this book by its cover. Cozy dining with authentic, homemade italian cuisine. Sure to be one of the local favorites! We highly recommend the "family meal" on the menu. It is well priced and will satisfy any appetite.<//Text>

If you want a low key, local fav, Giorgio’s is the place! If you want uptown, expensive, go to central Healdsburg.</Review>< Date>

< Review>
Have been going to Giorgio’s ever since I got a phone call from my brother Giorgio, (girigieo) as we called him when growing up togeather), asking me if I would work for him at his Restaurant in Healdsburg, California in Sonoma Country.

There were four older brothers and I was the youngest and only girl. I grew up loving and living in the restaurant life in San Francisco with my parents after we came to America as a Naturlized American Citizens in 1954. Our family was one of the last families that was processed through Ellis Island and one of the first families to bring New York style pizza to the West Coast in San Francisco along with Toto’s on Mission street at the time, and  Pasqule’s Pizza off of Irving Street. That was more than 64 years ago ! So when I tell you that my brother’s restaurant is steeped deep into Italian heratiage, know I am telling the truth because in a nut shell, it is who and what the sum of my life is today because I have staked my whole life in it as did my  brother George as I called him in our adult liAfter George had an untimely death when only 49 years old, 30 years ago, it was then my brother Bill took the restaurant until his own death five years ago.

Now my brother’s two children run Giorgio’s, carrying on the tradition. Marina and Angelo Anastasio are who you will most likely be seated by and greeted when you first enter through the front door. Know that they are not only giving you the best table in the house but are also welcoming you into our family as an unofficial member of all the families who have become part of our present day family. Welcome to all families of all Nations. When it comes to family, there is nothing more important except for my answing yes to my Brother’s question in that phone call so many years ago because I would never trade one moment of my time working at Giorgio’s for anything in the world and cherish each and every moment of those happy times.</Review>

Excellent service

Classic family style meal was delicious

The Mrs received a red rose for Valentine's Day

Complementary brachuto was served

Generous servings of wine

Fresh flowers on the table added to a perfect dinning experience

Unique coffee shop ! extremely pretty nude girls serving with a smile. Lot of TV screens showing sports and news. Would be a 5 star place if girls were more friendly instead of just smiling. Nice for a leisurely coffee or juice or coconut water drink.<//text>

The servers are beautiful and go the extra mile. However a few can use a major attitude adjustment. Coffee is supremely potent. Overall a great value for ten dollars< /review>

I love Kazoku! Been ordering and eating here for years.  Everything is excellent. Friendly staff, quality sushi, clean restaurant & bathroom.
*Bonus - they have their own delivery person. I do not order from places that let a random person deliver my food. The spicy tuna boat is their version of crispy rice spicy tuna, and I could order several and just devour them alone, but then again, I have to dabble into their rolls. Every roll here is stellar. ♥</text>

<Date>1490418865216</Date><Rate>5</Rate><text>Found this place based on yelp reviews. We were visiting Griffith observatory and decided to go here for dinner after a nice evening at Griffith observatory. Even though it says they have valet parking inside but it was self parking.

We started off with hot sake and then ordered fiery roll, tsunami roll with edamame. Service was pretty and I liked pretty much everything.< /text>< pics>

Sadly, underwhelmed by the food experience. Read a lot of good reviews about this place, but it just didn’t exceed expectations. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is friendly and welcoming. However, the rest of the meal just didn’t meet expectations. Previous reviews stating small portions is correct. I paid around $18 for a crunch California roll and a lobster roll. They tasted almost exactly the same. Saddened to see only 4 pieces for a California roll. Wait time wasn’t long, which I did appreciate, but it just isn’t on the top of the list for Sushi I must have.<//Review>

<Text>Go during happy hour for the best prices! It's a quite and cozy place nestled between a dozen of Thai restaurants. Been here twice now and would definitely be going again. I had been craving takoyaki for a while and this place cane through. The sushi is also great. Had the triple layered chocolate dessert and it was delicious too. While the happy hour prices are a steal, the regular menu prices are pretty decent too and worth paying for the food.<//Text><Time>1536776366554</Time><gmap_id>0x80c2bf50d2886feb:0xf21c0bbbb53ff6be<//gmap_id>< user>

<text>Sushi tasted like it had been sitting for a long time. Ordered 4 different rolls and all of them had a very strange texture. Looked like something you could pick up at a convenience store. The wasabi was even dry with almost no spice. Just bad.< /text><GmapID>0x80c2bf50d2886feb:0xf21c0bbbb53ff6be<//GmapID><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< date>

Left very disappointed. I wasn't expecting great sushi, but figured 4 stars would've been at least decent. We went during happy hour, hoping it wouldn't be super expensive, came out spending a lot more than we thought we would and still hungry.

The biggest disappointment was the shrimp tempura. The supposedly "crispy" crust was just soggy. The sashimi and sushi were very mediocre. Service is nice though, just wouldn't return again.< /text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Excellent small establishment. The average price of a roll is $ 12 delicious. A bit upset about the small amount of fish in Philadelphia. Worth a visit if you are nearby

(Original)
Отлично маленькое заведение. Средняя цена ролла 12$ вкусно. Немного огорчилась маленьким количеством рыбы в Филадельфии. Стоит посетить если будете поблизости<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_E2ZFkEb8ba--mtRXknOeieAlfHxOoBWe6zZd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnhg5FAo8NNBGNF2DxWeS4GARFCKzVVqKnOEU2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2bf50d2886feb:0xf21c0bbbb53ff6be</gmapID></record>

Amazing customer service and very professional medics. I visited the Center several times with different injuries and each time got immediate professional help.
Everyone from nurses to doctors are absolutely wonderful.< /text>

<Text>I was referred to this place by my office last week when I had injury at work. This week another of my colleague was injured too and I referred her to Medical Centre of Marin and since then, they have been taking good care of our conditions, hoping for the best in due time. Keep it up all.
Happy Easter and God bless you 🙏</Text><rating>4</rating>< Pics>

<review>I went to this clinic after verifying they could give blood tests regarding Lyme disease beforehand.  They assured me the examine doctor could make that determination, so I made the appointment.

I could not believe the level of hostility I experienced from the doctor.  She glared at me and kept repeating to me how my insurance might not cover my lab tests.  I kept having to reassure her I would take care of my expenses.  I don’t understand what aggravated her so much.  Patients come because we’re not feeling well.  Instead of being shown kindness, we treated with hostility. What is wrong with this place?!< /review>< pics>

<Text>Worst place unless you have simple issue, even that was a hassle...first time I went in had to wait  over an hour or more,  was about there 2 hrs for nothing waste of my time..they could have look at my issue or complaint and assess that they would not have the facility or equipment to do any other testing...then I waited in the room another 10 to 15 minutes  so altogether I was seen for 5 minutes and for the PA to say he could not do any more, all they took was an urine test and said I had blood .., their front desk is a joke...cannot get paperwork sent to another place so can be seen right away for who knows what condition I may have... they said they would send request for me to an urologists' and gastrologist ..called so many times, never got done...then I went back there again hoping for some luck for another issue,,had a bee sting, could not reach to take stinger out and I thought ok this is a minor issue   no one was in waiting room said there rooms were full and could not see anyone..was 2pm...seriously this place is a joke would never recommend anyone going there... I went to Dignity Health in Mill Valley.. was larger and cleaner  ...I was seen altogether from start to finish in  20 minutes and got whatever I needed and was done...the people there are so much nicer and better  ..not saying it will not be busy next time here but atleas they are more responsive and better managed than the other place...Now I know where to go in case something happens...</Text>< Pictures>

I was seen very close to my appointment time. The assistant helped me complete the forms (my finger was injured and broken). Everything was super clean and professional. The doctor is an ER specialist and was great. I felt confident in his diagnosis and treatment, as well as the care of the nurse. Two days later they called to check on me. They are a class act.</Text>< pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I understand that different places have different policies, but seeing one of your nurses walking around with out a mask, and another staff member there also not wearing a mask it’s quite worrying! Among the other patients there we just looked at each other in disbelief haha, it was quite comic. I just hope that you take our health and your health more seriously from now on. I will forward this to my HR dpt as well, poor safety standards in a medical clinic during this pandemia shouldn’t be an option.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80859a8d11dce6c9:0x8b78adf855a0230f<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The pretentious woman at the front desk obviously needs to look at what kind of vibe she gives off. Not a nice atmosphere at all the only person there that made me feel welcomed was the doctor he obviously knows that she is not good at being a receptionist but doesn’t fire her I guess anyways just wanted to share that experience...<//Text>

<Resp>{'time': 1565147600574, 'text': 'Dear Janna,\n\nWe are very sorry to hear about your experience at Medical Center of Marin. Our team works diligently to accommodate patients as swiftly as possible. However, if an insurance card is not presented at the time of service, this process can take longer as we have to wait on our end for verification from employer or insurance company. To address your statement about someone in waiting room having lice, this is simply untrue. We have no record of any patient with lice on the day you were seen and nor have we had a case in quite some time. As medical professionals, we understand fully that a lice infestation is a communicable disease and would take every precaution to arrange a quarantine for anyone with an ailment that can be so easily transmitted. Again, we are sorry that you had a negative experience and we wish you all the best of happiness and health.'}</Resp>< pictures>

This place really makes me sad. There is very little warmth at all to this office, and it’s clear that the people who work there are a bit desensitized from working with patients.

Couldn’t believe there was a patient in the waiting room with lice, and absolutely no precaution was taken to protect other patients.

After a long wait time, the person who assisted me with my vitals was absolutely the opposite of gentle and kind. She seemed very uninterested in what was going on with me, and in general there was very little kind regard for anything that was going on with me.

The folks who work here clearly need some training in patient care. I really hope to never come across another experience at urgent care like this one.<//review>

I called to see the wait time on a Friday afternoon and was told around 1.5 hrs. I was also given the option to get an appointment for Saturday. Arrived at my appointment 10 min early Saturday morning and was told there were 7 walk-ins in front of me so had to wait 2 hours.<//review>

I was up north on business not feeling well so I called my doctor who told me to go to the medical center of Marin and I am so thankful. Everyone was nice, helpful, courteous, and professional. The doctor was great, actually spent time to listen to my concerns and answered all my questions. Thanks for taking such great care of me, it's truly appreciated.<//Text>

I love Kayla’s excellent service from the time I called her on a last minute urgent care . I asked for her advice about getting a prescription on my colds. She immediately gave me availability for an appointment at 11:30am . She advised that I am required to be seen by a doctor for prescription. The other medical assistant was great too. She offered me water while waiting .Met Dr Connelly . She knew my symptom and had me gargled my mouth with Benadryl and licadin to reduce the stress on my throat and gave me the right prescription in which I thought of . They delivered EXCELLENT Service. Keep up the great job ladies 👍👍👍👍👍😀😀😀.. Well deserve👍👍👍👍👍<//review>

Well I am home now and want to give a shout out to this clinic.  I was visiting my cousin a couple of weeks ago and unfortunately started feeling weird and just not well.  My cousin has been here before for her daughter and so off we go to see what is going on with me.  I found that it was very clean and convenient and surprising quick.  They were super helpful on a weekend when most places besides the Emergency Room were closed.  By the way this is a  much better option than then ER.  My issue was diagnosed quickly as a bit of dehydration and steps were made quickly to get me up and on my way quickly so that I could enjoy my vacay with family.  Feeling great now.</Text>

I have had an ongoing Workers Comp claim and the staff and Dr's at this center have been overwhelmingly helpful.  I read that the parking was next door, which is not the case at MCOM.  There is ample parking bhind the building (their own lot), in front and along the road behind the center.  Anyway, I would like everyone to know that these people went above and beyond their duties in MY case and helped me to get money from my carrier for all of my bills quickly and with no problems. Keep up the great work in Corte Madera and thanks from my family and me!!<//review>

<review>If you ever need to go to the doctor and you can't get an appointment or if you have a minor emergency and don't want to deal with the hassle of the ER, this is your place! My family has been to this Urgent Care facility over a dozen times in the last few years and we have been seen for sinus infections, x-ray of a broken toe, received a breathing treatment, stitches and everything in between! Last night my oldest son had a biking accident and we arrived at the MCM about 15 minutes before closing. I was amazed at how wonderful the staff still was! Dr. Cipa even stayed a bit late to finish up and with the way they treated my son you would have thought we were the first patients of the day and not the last. His injury required six stitches and it was so nice to have that done for our specialist co-pay rather than waiting in the ER on a Friday night! We used to live within two miles of this center but have moved and still make the drive in because we know how fast they will see us and how wonderful the service is!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Had an unusal rash - a friend convinced it was Shingles  (since she has it)- went to the Clinic since I'm inbetween Doctors & moving to NY.  First they didn't take the insurance, but OK.   I told the Dr. it appeared to be Shingles, but she was more convinced that it was Poison Oak.  I Had been in an area with poison oak while golfing, BUT this was on my rib cage & no way it could've gotten there. She gave me all the reasons why she thought it was NOT shingles.  In fact, she teaches at UCB about Poison Oak to med students & even took some pictures. Prescribed cortizone. 4 days later getting worse, now starting to hurt - friend still thinks it's shingles. Was fortunate to be able to visit a UCSF Dermo & in 15 seconds diagnosed as shingles.  So now I've waited 4+ days, condition worse & a complete mis-diagnosis. To add insult to injury she took a culture - but according to UCSF guy, you can't do that for shingles with a simple swab - it's a sophisticated test costing upwards to $1000.  Bottom line, if it's a skin disease, try & find a specialist.  Not worth the anxiety & suffering.  And it cost $217.  I will be "requesting" my money back.....< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80859a8d11dce6c9:0x8b78adf855a0230f<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We try our best to inform potential patients about the insurance companies we are in contract with so they can make this personal decision.

<username>Jeff Delumpa</username><review>I'm a little weary of bringing my car to these oil change places only because of the all the bad publicity they've gotten over the years.  My mechanic wasn't available to do my routine oil change so I looked online for an oil change place since I needed it done before taking my car for a road trip.  I saw that SpeeDee in Millbrae had consistently great reviews and the highest rated out of all the oil change shops so I decided to give them a shot.  I'm so glad I did.

Brayan was my service guy, and he greeted me professionally upon arrival.  After the service was done, he walked me to my car and made sure to see that the oil was changed by showing me the dip stick.  I really appreciated that - NO ONE has ever done that for me before.  He also gave me an assessment of things that needed attention, which I was already aware of before showing up to SpeeDee; he was pretty spot on, which tells me they were thorough with their inspection.  I agreed to have them change out my cabin and air filters and he gave me a package deal price for the replacement.

Overall, my service experience was excellent, from beginning to end.  I will recommend this place to anyone looking to get their oil change with honest, professional people.  Thank you!< /review><Response>None</Response>< user>

Fast & efficient.  Courteous and professional.  Went in for their 17-point oil change.  They did not try to up sell me anything.  They even secured my loose under-carriage plastic panels for free.  They went above and beyond my expectations.  I highly recommend this team and I will definitely go back.<//Review>

Had a great experience while getting my coolant change with SpeeDee. They are really good at what they do and most importantly they provide honest reviews and services, which is always a concern if you are getting your beloved car serviced. Would always prefer and refer SpeeDee Oil Change<//review>

Great service, I'm very satisfied.
I won't go somewhere else.

Called 15 minutes before they closed to ask if I can bring my car for an oil change
They did it!!!
I would like to thank the lady that worked on my car (sorry didn't get your name).
Very professional and genuine worker.

< Review>
Today I had my oil  changed. The assistant‘s name is Alberto. He was so professional. Paid all the attention to the fine details. Explain to me every step of the way what he was doing and why he did it. He vacuumed the inside of the car. He topped up all the fluids. But most of all it was exceptionally friendly.

I took my 2015 Dodge Durango here for an oil change.  They came after about 20 min and told me they can't do it as the drain plug is too tight.  I called a different place and they were able to get me in the same day.  When I got to that shop and they lifted my car, the oil filter was loose and the oil had come out of my car.

I contacted the owner who claimed to do an investigation - including looking at the photos of the fresh oil all over my engine coming from the oil filter and claims no fault.  He says his tech was experienced and claimed to have followed their process.  I was at a new shop within 30 min of leaving here and the shop is claiming that I went somewhere and loosened the filter myself then went to another shop...< /Review><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

This is probably the first place I’ve gotten an oil change where they didn’t try to upsell me on extra services (cabin air filter, windshield wipers, etc.). They were a little pricy, but they cleaned my car pretty well and my oil change was done in 30 minutes. Will return for sure!< /Review>

Called Jiffy Lube, regular place, "$45."
So called here and talked to Ms. Chanal with the nice india accent; She told me, "No Reservations. First come, first serve. No wait now at 10am."

Then looked at their Google Map Reviews, mostly 4 and 5 stars.
"$10 coupon on Company website."
So went to it and pre-printed the $10 coupon!!
VERY IMPORTANT: The Entrance is on the side street, not Camino, the Exit! So just drive Clockwise around the building to the back, South side, ok?

Drove over.
10-30wt oil and new filter in less than 30min!
Carpet vacuumed, fluids checked and filled, even found defects like leaky trans and leaky radiator in my 19yr old Acura with 247,000 miles.
Filled tires too!

Total was less than $37.
Staff was very friendly and thorough.
Bathroom has a fancy sink and was very clean!
The coffee's free, but,,,.  ;)
DEFINITELY will come back, for Free Halfway Checkup and 3000mile oil and filter change!
Thank you all at Speedee!!

Plus,,,free Giants schedules!<//Review>

I am a car enthuist and trust my cars to Millbrae Speedy. I’ve been a regular customer for the past 5+ years. They have always done a thorough job and car inspection, and always leave my cars cleaner than when I arrived. It does get busy, which is a testament to their great service.</Review>

DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!
My stepdad recently took his Acura to get a transmission oil change here. He usually goes to the dealership to get it done but he was in a time crunch so he just went to this place since he didn't need an appointment. The next day, he noticed that the car was shaking and wasn't acting right. This car has never had any issues because my parents both keep up with the maintence and did I mention my stepdad is a mechanic! He knew something was wrong with the transmission. So he went back to this place and the manager got in face and accused him of blaming his broken transmision on them. My stepdad just wanted answers, they were awful to him. Not only do they not want to take responsibility, they go further and say we just wanted them to pay for a new transmission. Why would we want to go through this? My family is very hardworking and we can pay for whatever we need. The unprofessionalism these employees showed is disgusting, stay away from this place.<//review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>It was bit bad experience onmy previous cae. They tightenen oil filter too much so I could not untighten it.  It looks staff changed, so I went there in March with my current car.  At that time, they filled oil checking dip stick and properly filled 5.7 quarts.  Therefore I went again in July 2nd, however, the staff at that time were not friendly at all, and they over filled oil (6 quarts). looks they just filled 6 cans..  I found it later when I checked dip stick.  I tried to pull some oil out, however this time, they tightenen drain plug too much that I could not loosen it.  Over fill, tighten everything too much.. looks they don't care customers' cars at all.  If you want to make your car damaged, go there.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>This was the second time that I have used them for my car.
The 1st time I came in I needed and oil change and they did it so quickly and a reasonable price!
The 2nd time, I had a text from Jan reminding me I would need my brakes done. Low and behold I DEFINITELY did! So I went in and before I came I already knew about how much I was paying for and they were quick to source my parts. Which can be had sometimes since my Mitsubishi Mirage can be hard to find parts sometimes. They kept their promise and got the job done and BETTER YET it was a slightly lower price than what I had expected. The staff is super fair, communicative, and professional. So happy I had found this location.< /review></record>

<Review>Great Workers. AAA Auto repair center. Knowledge. Quick but through. Great place to service your vehicle. Staff was clear communicative and direct.

Went on a camping trip and ended up needing service repair. This center took great care of my partner and I during a stressful situation. Being AAA members we received a great price for the work and labor done.
Would recommend this spot to anyone who truly needs car care.

Shot out to Brit who was supper helpful, professional, and supportive during visit. Daniel was also very professional and gave great service.

Special thanks to this Team for Servicing my car allowing me to get back home safe and sound with no complications.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>I came in for a vehicle inspection which is required by my employer. The first time I was in, I failed, but they kindly explained that my rear tires were old with cracked sidewalls. They told me there was no charge for a failure, and when I got my new rear tires installed, they would be able to give my car a passing grade. I was back within a week with my new tires and this time it passed. Great crew there and friendly too.<//Text>< Rating>

Over 6 years progressively I got worsened customer service. Other customers complain on Yelp of shoddy work and shifty pricing structure. They cost me in excess of $500 plus interest for misdiagnosis and I used up all of my insurance roadside assists so I now pay out of pocket til renewal due to misdiagnosis of battery issue. A two-yr old 10,000 mile battery that it turns out was simply drained by the amp system of the radio.. Constant turnover of mechanics and new service Mgr is undiplomatic and money-conscious.The owner seems to let him run the show.  Get the sense they were going under and had to make ends meet. Old disreputable environment and hardly any room to park. This last time around, after owner scheduled me for appt to repair flat tire,  I drove there on the damaged tire, waited almost 1 hr.  only to be told guys wouldn't work on my car b/c I' d been "rude"to them before. Do they wonder why? Owner should've guaranteed appt. and told them to do work then terminate services. I expect honest evaluation, competence and consistent fair pricing commensurate with value not competitive. Difficult customers reward the most when work is good. Avoid them and go across the street to Tire Pros. who fixed the tire for free! VERY DISPLEASED WITH MEINEKE. But I thank them for saving me and my car further wear and tear.<//Text>

This is the first time I've used Meineke, and I was seriously impressed. I went there to get my brakes and rotors replaced, the last time I serviced my brakes was eons ago. After they did their free brake inspection, I learned that the rotors had some minor wear and tear but no action needed to be taken at that point. Other places would have tried to up-sell as much as possible by exaggerating the brake wear, but instead they gave me an honest inspection report. When the brakes do need service, I'll definitely be using Meineke.< /Text>

<review>Very disappointed with their service.
Took them 6 hours to figure out I needed a new fuel pump. Never called the entire day to inform us or give us a quote. Then calls us the next day to tell us the car should be done by 4. We drove 2 hrs. Sat in Santa Barbara from 12- 6 pm and was then told the car was not ready. We had to drive another 2 hours back home. There was only one guy working on 6 cars.
It was ridiculous. I am beyond mad. I still do not have my car! I will never go to this chain and will definitely  be making a complaint with AAA.< /review><rate>1<//rate>< gmapID>

<Text>I had a great experience. I called ahead of time to schedule a brake diagnostics. I made the appointment with Jan and Britney checked in y car the day of. They discovered that my fuel line was leaking so they told me I needed to take care of this right away. They gave me a ride home while they started repairs on my vehicle. They called me back with a quote to repair my car. I asked them that I needed time to figure out what I would do. I called back later and spoke with Jan who shared with me that my AAA MEMBERSHIP allowed for a discount and she suggested to apply for the credit option where I would get a rebate if I applied to use that as well. I gave Jan the go ahead to begin repairs and she estimated that my car would be ready in a few days. I called back a few days later to check on the progress and they helped me to get my car sooner than the initial estimate. When I came to pick up my repaired car, Jan made sure to sign me up for Meineke’s rewards program! I was so happy with the customer service and look forward to the next time I need to have repairs on my vehicle.</Text>< Name>

< Review>
surprised me with their thorough, honest diagnosis and  service. One thing that I would recommend, is to implement better COVID precautions— the billing/waiting room office is tiny (maybe 12x12 ft) and there were like 3 customers and 2 employees crammed in there at one time. I felt uncomfortable and I felt bad for the employees that have to stay in that room with mouth breathing customers like myself.

Nevertheless, it’s uncommon to find a quick auto repair shop (menike, jiffy lube, Firestone)  with employees that aren’t very experienced or trying to rip you off . the people at this Meineke are skilled at their trade and truly care about their customers and the work they do.< /Review>

<review>My first experience was far better than the 2nd but both experiences had issues with "not the correct part".  The 2nd experience is what made me literally run out even forgot my drinks and sunglasses just couldn't get out of there fast enough after having sat and waited 2 hours for an oil change when I even had an appointment.  Then when backing out one of their techs was backing out of a bay and didn't even see me.  He just boop boop came right out.<//review>< Pictures>

I was teaching my son how to change the oil in the truck and he accidentally overfilled. I went straight to your shop located on State Street here in Santa Barbara. And the attendant could not have been nicer or more helpful. They not only drained the little bit of oil that was necessary, they also inflated my tires and vacuumed my truck at very little cost. This is quality , no doubt<//Text>

<userid>116329355797732993173</userid><review>Earlier this month, I took my car in for an oil change and tire rotation. As part of this, the car gets an inspection. I was in and out, and was told that my car looked good, other than uneven wear on the front tires and my air filter needed to be changed. Fair enough, these were things I was already aware of. However, when I went out to my car, my tires were not rotated. I went back and asked why the tires weren't rotated, and I was told the front tires were too bald to be put in the back. Okay, that's fine, but I wasn't sure why this wasn't mentioned before I was given the keys. I went to get new tires the next day (at a different establishment), and was planning on replacing the two tires that were balding. However, I ended up needing to replace all 4 because there was a giant nail in one of the "good" tires! The mechanic said it looked like it had been in there awhile given how worn the nail head was. Considering I had been to Meineke the day before and they "inspected" my car-- including my tires-- I'm not sure how this was missed. It makes me question what else might have been overlooked on the inspection.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x80e915254bfb7241:0xdf1f0ececffdff65<//gmapID>< Name>

<Review>We ended up here after having our car overheat in Burbank and getting towed back to Santa Barbara with AAA. This location is one of their affiliates and we were told we’d get good service and a 10% discount for repairs there. They said we had a leak in our water pump hose, which needed to be replaced, and that it would be more affordable to buy an entire radiator kit rather than the hose parts separately, and it was necessary to have the whole thing flushed after, as well as replacing a worn serpentine belt. They estimated this would be $1558 after taxes, which was more than the car is worth. We got 2 second opinions who both agreed this wasn’t reasonable, and decided to take our car elsewhere. They charged $120, after the discount, for the diagnostic alone.

< Review>
The great thing about Meineke Santa Barbara is its locally owned. Their staff is always friendly, polite and courteous. Eric was great at helping me get my car fixed and even showed me what was wrong with my car instead of just telling me what I needed. Jan was very personable and pleasant to work with when checking out. What I love about coming here is they actually know what they’re doing and I trust them with my car and that’s huge for me especially having to drive often long distances and putting the safety of my car in their hands takes the ease off my shoulders.</Review>

<Text>One of the WORST service centers in SB. Highly recommend AGAINST this establishment. For the lack of a better phrase, it would appear that the owners/mechanics aren't ethical about repairs and cost. They fabricate costly repairs and make it sound like it was the customer's fault all along. For instance, my car developed some cabin noise just after a regular servicing with them. I took it out to have it checked; they generously offered to look into it without any cost - so far so good. Less than 30 mins into the check-in, I get a call from their lead mechanic (Eric?) that the starter is broken and the car wouldn't start up and it would $800 to fix it. This startled me as the the car is relatively new and has had never shown any prior problems. This did not sound right at all - red flags all over it. A quick show at a local mechanic told me that someone messed with the battery to make it look like a starter issue - just to swindle money from customers. The local guy jump started the battery and it works perfectly now. DO NOT go to this service center.</Text>< user_name>

<text>i was traveling through & it was time for an oil change. i called for a quote over the phone & they said just over $90. i arrive & they say actually your car requires another quart of oil so it’s going to be over $100 now. i was confused bc i’ve never paid for an extra quart so i asked why & triple-checked. their response was that is what their computer calls for. then after paying for my most expensive oil change, i drove to santa cruz. i definitely should have checked the oil before leaving (mistake on my end), but i left the hotel the next morning & beforehand checked the oil level bc meineke said i also had an oil leak. i was surprised to see the oil was well above maximum capacity. so i was charged  for an extra quart that wasn’t required, then to be told i have an oil leak that needs to be changed asap yet it took until about 3000 miles to get my oil level back down to normal. this was in july.< /text>< gmapID>

Jan is VERY unprofessional, and after sharing my experience on social media, I'm not the only one who feels this way. My car broke down, I had it towed to meineke on upper state. I couldnt afford to fix it, so it was there for 11 days. I stayed in contact with her regarding my inability to move it. When I came to pay, she came out of the back room and yelled at me... speaking down to me in front of several other customers who looked shocked. She charged me $75, without telling me she would, to store the car for one additional day. If my car broke down, and I can't afford to fix it, 75 bucks is a big deal. Kick me while I'm down, no thank you.

One friend of mine, a senior citizen, spoke poorly of her saying 'she is horribly unorganized and hot tempered, and she cant seem to remember anything.'

Another friend said a mechanic there offered him $100 for his car, a 2016 scion... shady.

I certainly will never go back to this Meineke, and I encourage prospective customers to go somewhere else.</Text>

Spoke with Jan, who assured me they would take care of everything including the inspection and tire change.  It was early morning, when I spoke to her, but she was cheerful and reassuring.  (Something I very much needed at that time.). The job was done by 1:00;  I could pick up my car and be to work without being very late for my shift.

The customer service at Meineke could be improved significantly. We had to wait 2 1/2 hours for oil change on two cars, even though we had an appointment. We expected to receive a call but after 2 hours of waiting, we decided to go back to the shop to check on the cars. It turned out the cars are ready but nobody called us. We had to wait another 20-30 mins at the shop until we could pay and get our cars.

The people there use old times tactics to persuade you to fix certain things on your car. One of the man there used the term "and now to the difficult car" referring to the issues they recommend fixing. Overall it is a painful experience having to wait long at their shop and having to decline all of their offers.

Another issue was that they did not rotate the tires of one of my cars, even though I explicitly requested so, due to the tires being "worn out too much". The front tires were worn much more than the rear ones and this is the reason I wanted them rotated. They declined rotation, thus making my car less safe then it could be if the tires were rotated.

And lastly, my steering wheel was too dirty with oil after the service. My hands got all the black dirt while I was driving home. I had to wipe it afterward.

Price is good, location is OK (a bit busy), but I will definitely look for another place for an oil change.</Text>

RIP OFF!! Got a new Serpentine Belt (I told them it could be the serpentine belt based on what I'd researched). They diagnosed my car and told me that I needed a new serpentine belt. Two months later same noise that I thought was the serpentine belt started up again. Took my car back to find that it wasn't the serpentine belt. According to them it's the alternator, belt tensioner assembly and idler pulley that's causing the noise. I DONT TRUST THEM AT ALL!! I said so did I really need a new serpentine belt? And my answer was,  "I'm not sure, but it was worn so we replaced it". Get a second opinion! These guys are filling quotas.< /review>

Needed a window repaired that had fallen off its track, and needed it done asap, as we were on a road trip. The SB Meineke crew were very fast and the price was fair, they fixed the window in about 2.5 hours ! . I would highly recommend them, they had lots of customers and it seemed like a place the locals go to ( just try to avoid using their public restroom, it's kind of gross....but what do you expect at a  auto repair place )<//text>

I went here to fix the car light that had went out, and the mechanic displaced the light. When I was driving at night, the beam would project in different direction, I had to go back the next day to get fixed, only to find out that he also had not put back the cap that protects the wires from being deranged.

Every time I go back for oil change, they try to up sell with other stuff, trying to open up my car, but due to lack of attention to details I experienced the first time I wen there, I cannot allow them to touch any moving part of my car because I have a feeling they might be reckless with it and boom, I loose a tire on freeway!

The man handling the customer was not too great with computer so it delay my appointment more than 30 minutes and held up the rest of the people. While I understand he had difficulty, he was taking his frustration on the customers, not the best look for the business.<//Review>

However the inspection report shows that they are no different from those maintenance shops that are trying to rip you off. So basically the report says that my car is gonna fall apart: all four tires, air filter, spark plugs, serpentine belt, valve cover, ALL need to be replaced! There's also brake fluid, coolant, and power steering fluid ALL need to be replaced and flushed. Things like the belt, air filter, and tires are very easy to inspect so I don't know how can they tell me everything needs to be replaced when everything looks good. They also didn't do tire rotation because my tires were "too dangerous to put back on" LOL! The service was ok but I wouldn't believe a word on their inspection report.< /Review>< pics>

It seemed they were in the middle of training a new employee, which slowed things up a little.
However the desire to diagnose my brake problem and explain the repairs were spot on and the service was preformed in a timely manner with stellar results.
Thanks so much.😊</Text>

< Review>
When I showed up to get my car checked out, this location was totally slammed busy. Even so, they got my info down and in 5 min they had scheduled me an appt for 2 hours later. They were ready for me when I showed up 10 minutes early to my appt, got me an estimate very quickly, and were able to show me exactly what was wrong so I knew it was a legitimate problem before spending to fix it. I called my old mechanic in Reno to confirm their estimate and he agreed he wouldn't do that work for any cheaper, I was getting a great price. Meineke completed the work in about the projected time, and had my car back on the road same day, despite their shop  lathe being broken and needing to resurface my rotors at another shop. I believe it was Adam who helped me out. He was there from when I came in at 9a til I left with my car at 6p, and didn't seem like he was leaving til he finished up his work. He was hustling around, making it happen the entire time I was there, an excellent employee. Will definitely be returning to this location for all my car servicing needs.< /Review>

Wish I had checked the reviews. I will never go back.

Summary:
1) Overcharged.
2)Told I had emergency brake work, and my car was unsafe to drive when it wasn’t, offered overpriced repairs.
3) Car began leaking oil after service, and at next oil change at dealership I was informed the oil plug was stripped, $100 bandaid, $600+ to fix/replace.
4) Meineke Customer Service unresponsive

1)	Overcharged: Charged an additional $10 for oil filter, when price on the desk where I was paying said it was included.

2)	When they called to tell me my oil change was done, I was informed that I needed new brake pads and roters, that they were “metal on metal” and that the car would be dangerous to continue driving without immediate replacement, the quote to replace was between $700-$800. I called around and found many shops offered the service for $100-$200 less. When I took my car into Big Brand Tires for an inspection/second opinion, they informed me that it was not metal on metal, or an immediate safety concern. I did not need new rotors. I was at the “manufacturers recommended time for replacement”.

3)	My car began leaking oil after my oil change service. At my next service at the dealership, they informed me that my oil plug had been stripped. This was going to cost ____ to replace the oil pan (I got several quotes from repair shops). They were able to use a “time-cert” plug to bandaid the problem, with no guarantee for $100. I researched online. An oil plug should last the life of the vehicle. It is damaged by overtightening. This can easily be avoided by using proper mechanic tools.

4)	I contacted Meineke Customer Service to request Meineke pay for the cost of the repair. It took several weeks before I received a response. Once I received the response, I was asked to submit more paperwork substantiating my claim. I submitted the paperwork and never heard back. I resent the paperwork and contacted them at least 2 more times with no response.

As a result I am leaving this negative review to inform other consumers.</text>

I'm an Uber driver, so the state of my ride is of paramount importance! Well, as I was driving a passenger through rush hour traffic, the check engine light came on and my beloved Hyundai Elantra began to shake and tremble in a very alarming way. . The tremors were growing more intense by the minute; I nearly scheduled another driver to step in, but the lady in my backseat was a good sport, saying she didn't mind the turbulence. ("I was born and raised in California, earthquakes don't phase me!")
Reaching our destination, she kindly reassured me, but the comforting words fell flat against the look of grave concern on her face; I knew this was serious.
Distraught, I pulled into the Meineke here on  upper state and immediately felt better. The owner, Jan (awesome and very knowledgeable lady) had an estimate ready for me within a few minutes. A very thorough inspection was performed by the service manager, Adam, and he caught multiple issues which were missed during a recent inspection with another repair shop. In fact, the issue was very specific to my particular vehicle, and indicated Adam's expertise.
Came back the next day, Adam and Jan hooked me up with awesome discounts (meineke website is great for coupons), and my car is now running flawlessly for a very reasonable price. Thanks guys!<//Text>

< Review>
To whom it may concern at Meineke customer service,

My first experience at Meineke car care went a little like this:

Four months ago I went down to the office and made an appointment for the following day at 8 AM to avoid the wait.  I showed up to my appointment five minutes early, did the paperwork needed and handed over my keys.

After about an hour, noticing that my truck was still in the shop, I went into the office to see how much more time it was going to take. At that time they announced to me that they had lost my keys, or miss placed them and that they were looking for them.

Long story short, 45 minutes later I was finally in my vehicle.

I chalked it up as human error, and went about my day.

Let me share with you my second experience with Meineke.

Are you going to get an oil change, sympathetic, package and the lady at the counter says “no problem, it’ll be ready in an hour“.  A $70 oil change, with one filter, was $128. A little alarming, but it’s when they told me that my door handle broke on my truck is when I started to get a little irritated.

I ordered a new door handle, and add the damages caused by Meineke‘s employees, my experience at Meinicke yesterday cost me $300.

I realize now, that is my last trip to Meinicke for any services on my vehicle and a heads up to anyone planning on having their vehicle serviced at Meinicke to give it some extra thought  before you invest your money in a company with no customer care.

And so that’s that.

<review>I went in for an oil change and a look over, the Service Reps were really nice.  I asked them to check out the wheel bearings specifically since I took my Mercedes E350 Coupe in to have a couple fog light bulbs replaced months before to a mechanic shop downtown and they wrote up a list of things that needed to be replaced and the wheel bearings was one of the items.  It turns out that my wheel bearings are fine.  They did say I needed new rear tires which was one of the items on the list.  I felt that they were professional and honest</review>< resp>

My experience was so positive.  They fixed an oil leak that I had for years for practically nothing.  Other places wanted to charge me $800+.  They were polite, efficient and competent.  From now on, they will be the only ones I trust to work  on my cars.</Text>

<Text>Like others have said, ignore older reviews; I started coming here because the previous owner was excellent, but my experience with the new ownership was poor.

I brought my car in for an oil change, which they predicted would take 40 min. Two hours later I returned- my car had been finished for an hour, but they forgot to call me.

The woman at the counter did a really poor job explaining issues with my car. Nothing against her- she was nice enough- but I have a limited knowledge of cars. That's why I go to a mechanic! You've got to have someone behind the counter who can explain what is going on.

At the end of her list was a suggestion for three new tires. She asked if I would like the tires today. I said, "no, I'll wait on the tires". So she handed me my bill without addressing any of the other issues. I guess I'll get them taken care of somewhere else.

Not the worst experience, but really unprofessional in several ways. I will not be trusting them with my car in the future.</Text><gmap_id>0x80e915254bfb7241:0xdf1f0ececffdff65</gmap_id>< name>

I recommend this place to everyone! My experience with them showed me they care about their customers and take responsibility, too.

So yes, a mistake was made, and an oil change went wrong leading to all the oil leaking out and leaving the engine completely shot. But not only did they completely take care of everything - towing my car back, a replacement car while mine was out of commission, and a replacement engine installed for no charge at all, they did it in a friendly way, apologizing for what happened and totally accommodating my schedule and needs. Even a month later, they are helping out and fixing small things relating to the new engine for free.

I have gone here for oil changes for two years, and in general, I have never felt pushed by these guys to buy anything. They're happy to tell you what is urgent and what isn't, and just generally have been a pleasure to deal with.

It might be me, but I just haven't heard a mechanic ever say 'oh that was our fault, sorry, let me fix that for you at no cost'. Awesome, hat tip to Thomas for the excellent service.< /Text>

< Review>
What should have been a simple oil changed turned into a nightmare. I had to take my car back three times in the same day to have a significant oil leak fixed. Turns out they striped the threads to the drain plug and to seal it they put in an over sized plug, not my original factory plug, and sealed it with silicone to stop the leak. They never told me this and when I found out they would take zero responsibility and tried to blame me some how. Their liars and cheats. Go any where else but here.< /Review>

<review>I went to get an oil change and it took 3 hours. I kept asking how long it would take with 15 minutes being the response, every time. The receptionist was very nice,  but it was a horrible experience overall. They tried to tell me I HAD to replace my "cracked" radiator and quoted me 768$ to replace it. Told me it had no more fluid in it, but the receipt said 3/4 empty. I denied the service, and I asked them to fill the coolant to the top before I left. I looked and they just put water in it. And not much. They are crooked. Don't go to this place.<//review>< pics>

< review>
I was going to Meineke because they had a 20 dollar oil changed coupon. I set an appointment and when I arrived they told me that they were a little bit behind schedule. So I waited, and an hour and a half later my car was still not ready nor pulled up to start a change. Once I told them that I had made an appointment so I wouldn't be waiting they told me my car would be next. Then I asked how long it would take for them to change my oil and they said around an hour to hour an a half. No one wants to wait at a shop for 3 hours. I know it doesn't take over an hour to change the oil. I needed up wasting my time and gas on something that never ended up happening. Lastly the main guy behind the counter was rude. In the end I would never recommend someone going there. Service was awful!!!<//review>

I have visited this place many times over the two years that I have lived here in Santa Barbara.. I came from Santa Clarita and wanted to find a good reliable place to bring my cars for service and maintenance on my cars.. A GOOD friend recommended I go see Jan and her husband (names escapes me, sorry) at Meineke Car Care Center, so I did.  JAN IS AWESOME.. she is beyond helpful every time we bring our cars to here.  Their Management Style of this wonderful gem of a business in our town WORKS in a big way.  They have all aspects of Customer Service and Customer Care for one-up visitors and those who, like me, become lifetime visitors for all our mechanical needs.  You are a solid business and I respect and appreciate your business practices.. Oh yeah.. the chocolates are pretty cool too.  :)  Thanks for everything and i'm sure the cars will bring us back again soon.  Hugs for everything... and HUGE KUDOS for helping our my girlfriends white Mazda banged corner and popping that out for us on a Saturday.  Much appreciated.  rick FIege< /Text>

<Review>I had taken my car in before and would've given them good reviews, until this incident: They stripped the oil pan screw like they did with another person who's review is below. If this had been all, I would've given them a rating of three stars, but it wasn't.

First, it is very easy to make it so that stripping a screw will never happen, and that is car mechanics 1: put it in by hand, then only tighten it when it's in with the socket. They did not do this.

However this was not the major problem: after stripping the screw, and taking approximately four hours to try to repair it, they did not tell me about it, even though I saw them working on it, and caulking it in place like they did the person below! Naturally, oil leaked like crazy. It ruined a large spot in my driveway, which couldn't be corrected by cleaning then coating the driveway. The oil light came on and luckily I saw it and added 4 quarts of oil. It all leaked out also. Luckily I saw this before it ruined the engine, which I am sure they would have happily charged me to work on.

Naturally they charged me for the work that they allegedly did. However, the fact that they did not tell me that there was an issue and tried to sneak it by, says that they will do anything including lie for money: will they tell you that you need services that you don't need for money? YES. Will they lie and say that they did something that they did not for money? YES.  I would have to assume the answer to these is yes, which is why I only give them one star. I photographed the driveway (which is still a mess), and took my car in elsewhere, and had them put it on the lift with me there. They immediately identified the problem and showed me the dripping oil. They showed me that the oil screw had been caulked in place. As I know that I saw them doing this, and as they had done the three prior oil changes there was no question who did it. Their unwillingness to tell me about it because of the cost to them to repair it is insulting.

As I documented everything, I was thinking of suing, as the cost to me to replace the oil pan, and re-recoat the driveway will certainly be more than $750.  However, frankly I do not want to see them again.

The interesting thing is that the day I was in there there was another person being told about his 3rd or 4th(!) oil leak on the same car.  All I could do is wonder after this occurred to me if there really was an oil leak, or if it was just them making money of these people like they did off me.  Check out the persons review below (1 star) where the same thing happened to him in the same way.  Well I learned at a cost of $750!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I'd give no stars if I was able to, I came in at 9am took 2 hrs for an oil change, currently there is a coupon for Father's day , it's is labeled as 45th Anniversary 45% off for premium oil changes. I was written by Jad, Jad told me at the check out that the corporate coupon was not acceptable and that I could only use AAA 5% or axxis 10% off her words were " if you use that coupon it would cost more for parts / fluid than what you would pay, it would be like buying my customers, it is going to attract the wrong community" - what ever that last part ment ... I only came here because I needed a last min oil change before business trip I was recommended by coworkers and when i called Meineke said I could come in 10min. Sorry Meineke, you lost a customer, I cannot recommend you and will advise my fellow co-workers of this experience, overall the establishment is very unprofessional... Corporate has been contacted and my statement has been given.</Text>< rating>

<Text>WARNING THESE PEOPLE DONT KNOW WHAT THE HECK THEY ARE DOING!!!

I went in for an easy trans mission fill because i had warning lights on my dash saying it was low. I took it to my mechanic and he told me it is low about 15% but my mechanic didnt have the fluid to do it so i took it to Meineke here in santa barbara for  the fill.

The car i own is a BMW 525I. Everyone who is a professional mechanic knows you have to go from under the car while the engine is running to fill the transmission fluid up. THIS GUY Went under my car pulled the plug  transmission fill plug out and used a pump to fill it. However The failure to this poor uneducated man put 10 drops of the Fluid in and saw the fluid coming back out. He then plugged up the transmission and dropped my car and said it didn't need any fluid that it was full.

I tried to stop him to tell him your doing it wrong. But he insisted on saying it was full. He told the desk clerk to charge me 35$ for the fill.

I left and I will never come back to this IDIOT OF A PLACE EVER

I hope the Meineke Higher ups see the idiocy of this Branch and RE EVALUATES ITS EMPLOYEES.

<Text>THIS SHOP IS TERRIBLE! Brought my car in for engine misfire, got $400 of service (tune-up) done that supposedly "fixed" the problem. 1 week later brought the car in for the same exact issue, paid another $300 for the original problem to be fixed again (shouldn't that work have been on them!?!) meanwhile, asked them to fix front headlamp that was out….NEVER REPLACED both times. Included in a tune-up should be all vital fluids checked, if not topped off….less than a month after the service when i was back in the bay for my break, my car overheated…when taken into a different shop back home, they told me that my coolant reservoir had NO ANTIFREEZE (just a little bit of water) but NO LEAK. therefore in the tune-up meineke did, my fluids were never checked, leaving my coolant resorovir completely empty, for me to overheat on a 300 mile drive back home. when i went back to this meineke and told them about the issues i had, they did not compensate me whatsoever. they proceeded to say the tune ups they do are not 'complete tune ups'.

The rest of our group got their food and ate before ours came out. We got a refund and left. The place was busy so  some people like it but we struck out when it came to service. The others in out party were not very thrilled about their food. The flavor was lacking</Text>

<text>L&L Hawaiian BBQ provides the Keto conscious crowd with nutritious and delicious combinations of food selections. A favorite is their BBQ chicken and salad lite combo. You will be satisfied with their healthy alternative selections. The taste is second to none and the quality is as good as it gets. Prices are reasonable and a customers can expect to eat comfortably for under $10.

<text>Had a bad experience here a few months ago. Decided to give them a second chance, tried the Loco Moco. Wish I didn't, the patties were hard from being old and microwaved. However the eggs were decent. Never returning here!!< /text></record></dataset><record>

This place knows how to serve their customers. Consistently with a very friendly mindset. The food is affordably priced, regularly tasty and clean.< /review>

Food was good. But, we do think it is overpriced for the amount and quality of food we got. We ordered the BBQ kalbi short ribs plate and the chicken katsu bowl for take-out. While the katsu bowl was packed and very filling the short ribs...we got three very thin slices of meat and scant amount of rice and salad like WTH barely anything there. Really not worth $11 to $12. We didn't check the plate before we left. Should have taken a pic, but forgot because was super hungry. Very disappointed. Not sure if we will come here again.< /Text>

< Review>
I treat myself to L & L when I'm in an area where I dont really know the surrounding restaurants and need to grab z bite.  I ordered the Katsu with curry regular meal and our 2nd meal was the burger and fries.
The katsu didt have curry, so I ate it dry. The hamburger and cheese had a floppy bun and no fixings, and fry to the bone.
I will never go to this location again and will visit other restaurants during Covid-19.  Very disappointed with this experience.< /Review>

i want to give this place a 3.5, but ill round up. in terms of the food. the meat is cooked to the standard i hold yo all hawaiian BBQ. they are also very generous on the portions

The problem i have with this place is the rice. i am the kind of guy who loves his rice. The main thing that can ruin any meal is the rice and how its cooked. all i can say is between the chicken katsu and the masubi i ate, the rice was too mushy. if i were to guess, the rice was cooked with too much water. its a minor grip for most, but easily a minus 1.5 stars for me.</text>

<text>Yelp had tons of negative reviews, leaving thos branch at 2.5 stars.  I've never had any issues with the food or service.  Not sure why so many people were bashing on the place.  Don't let it sway your opinion.  The food tastes great, the portions are generous, literally the only problem is the lobby smells a bit funky.  Like their drains or sinks are in need of a plumber.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>I walked into L&L Hawaiian BBQ by mistake.  I figured as long as I was there, I would try it.  I don't know what was going on, but the people working didn't smile and weren't friendly.  (Bad day?) I asked what their best dish was.  The woman said BBQ chicken, which I ordered.  (Deep sigh.)  Since that was their best food, I won't be returning. This was a while ago, so maybe they have improved cooking and service.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Good food and fair prices. Once I ate there and the meat was tender and juicy, and the sides felt nice and fresh. The portions are generous. I was helped by a young, blonde girl who was really friendly and helpful. I live in this area and I think this is the best option in Campus Plaza.</Review>

<Text>First time at L&L. I tried the curry chicken katsu...unbelievably good. A full order was plenty to leave me left-overs for the next day. The macaroni salad that comes with it isnt anything special, but I gotta say, they cook their rice perfectly, and I cant remember the last time I was actually impressed with plain white rice.</Text>< Resp>

THE WORST customer service I've experienced. The middle aged Latina woman who was working at the register tonight is killing your business!!! I walked in with not a single customer inside and the female employee was on her phone. She looked up at me, didn't say a word, not even a smile and proceeded to stay on her phone for at least another 30-45 seconds while I patently waited along with the other customer who walked in right after me. She finally gets off her phone and first word she said to me was a rude "are you ready?". I ordered a seafood combo and she immediately tells me they're out of shrimp and seemed so bothered that I asked what my substitute options were. I was so disgusted by her rude attitude and lack of service that I walked out of the store without ordering and I'll never be back.
One bad employee is a representation of bad management and the business itself. That employee should not be working customer service and is costing you your business!<//text>

<Text>For appearances, it is adequate place setting for college students that like Hawaiian barbecue. While I take note of the reviews bellow (some had bad experiences some good), my experience with this restaurant starts with when I ordered. My server Kate was very friendly, even when the purchase process went a little bad, she did a few things to make sure it went right.

For the rating of the food, I'd give it a 4 solid out of my generous heart because one I personally am a fan of katsu chicken and two it was brought out pretty quick.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Been here before used to be an all around very good place.  But the restaurant had a burning plastic smell that really lingered, and the counter help was friendly though very chatty with each other.  I waited 25 almost 30 minutes for my food that they claimed they called between their long conversation about grub-hub workers.  I don't know if they thought we were just sitting in L&L for fun.  Would not want to walk-in order again when the  talkatives are working.  Or just go to Homestyle.</review>< Time>

<text>I can see why this location has the rating that they do. I've never been to a L&L location that didn't have the best customer service. Every girl at the register at this location is just plain rude. They don't welcome you when you enter with that "ALOHA SMILE GREETING". Sadly I work next to this location. I've given them about 4 different chances to change my point of view and my experiences have only gotten worse. Hope the management gets this place in order
Overall the food taste good, but I'm very simple and pretty much only order their spam masubis. And they're always either low on rice, or very thin pieces of spam. It's just not comparable to all the other locations I've been too sadly<//text><user_name>xyz</user_name><Response>None<//Response><UserId.>110818203412998349938<//UserId.><Rating>3< /Rating>< GmapID>

This place smells weird, food tastes off (not like other better quality locations), and they are BEYOND STINGY on the Mac and Rice portions. I ordered extra Mac and they have me like half of a regular scoop at other locations. The amount of rice I received was laughable- think a scoop the size of a half dollar. I didn’t even know they made scoopers that small! Even an ice cream scoop would be larger! Just skip this location. Drive to the next.<//Review>< user>

<review>I asked for teriyaki sauce. The girl at the front counter gave me sriracha packets and instead of teriyaki sauce, which I come here for. Gave me soy sauce, about six of them. I didnt even get Katsu sauce for my meal. I called corporate office and told me that the owner is on vacation. I drove back to the place with the soy sauce and got the sauce I wanted only before tasting it. The woman at the counter lied to me and told me that these are the only things they had.i will never go back there.<//review>< userid>

<Review>Lily was very rude and didnt give me the food i paid for i order from here all the time. I called three times and she hung up on me. Im very disappointed today, ruined my whole day i had no ride to get any food all i had was money on my card instead of offering me a different choice she said i shoulda did whatever she said in a very rude tone of voice..... All i wanted was to substitute chicken because i get a weird reaction when i eat chicken but yeah way to go lily👎👎👎👎👎 money wasted</Review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

<Text>L&L is basically amazing. I've eaten at more of their locations than I can remember. Not only here, in California, but also in Hawai'i. I swear they have the same 2 or 3 employees working at every single location. I'm not sure how they do it, though... (cloning, perhaps?) Across the board, every time, the food is absolutely consistent. By which I mean awesome. You guys rock. Keep it up, dudes.<//Text><date>1619903570209<//date></record>

The chicken sandwich was ok, but the fries...oh my gosh, the fries.  These were the worst fries I've ever had from any restaurant.  They were unsalted, cold, greasy, and tasted like the oil hadn't been changed in quite a long time.  Will definitely not be going back with so many other options right there.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80d95697684352e9:0x3961c151d84998c8</Gmap_id></record>

Being from Hawaii my expectations are high.
BUT, when the girl behind the counter is eating while I order, picking a massive scab on her elbow and has mouth cold sores, all of the flavor in the world goes out the window. With this visual I grabbed two black cand and a side of mac salad to go with my now Jersey Mikes sub. The mac salad was mayo and a few flecks of carrot. There were dried out pieces of mac and was kind of warm. I tried to add the needed white pepper and salt that was completely missing but after visualizing a scab in there somewhere I just threw it out. Black cans were on point though.
WTF L&L?< /Text>

Great food here, had a Polynesian friend bring me here, and he said the food is authentic.
Many options for food, and if you want a party you can order large party platters.
It is a bit small though if they had a bigger interior that would give them that fifth star that I sadly denied.< /review>

As soon as i walked in i was hit by a funky smell, like wet dog and rotten egg. Cashier didn’t let me open door to air out tiny place, she must have liked the smell. She blamed it on the sewer and that the building was old, but somehow chipotle next door smelled fine🤔 The ice was out and the drinks tasted weird as well.. only thing on point was the musubi... but I’m sticking to my original location i go to</text>

Ordered a plain bbq burger to go. Opened at work, seen that the burger was oddly wet, with lots of clear liquid at the bottom and it had cheese, and ketchup inside after asking three times while ordering to make sure it's bbq burger plain. I called to let them know there was a mix-up, the lady on the phone asked me to come now. I told her I'm at work and can take photo of it if they don't believe me. The bun on bottom was saturated and soggy. She then said "so what you want me to do? You come tomorrow or what you want?" I said I can come tomorrow. She asked my name, I had to spell MAL 3X. she spelled it NAL, Nell, Now.... After 4x she finally got it right, each time I said M as in MARY A as in Apple L as in Lima. She asked my phone number. Only part she got right was 619 rest was numbers that were totally wrong in sequence. I decided to cancel the offer and said I rather not return at all. Forget it. They are ruining the good reputation of L&L trade mark and have no idea what the true meaning of aloha is. Don't work for an aloha style restaurant if you cannot offer it.<//review>

< Review>
The service here is absolutely horrible. I called in an order, spoke to a male who was obviously new. He didn't even know how to answer the phone/what to say to a customer calling in. He didn't ask for a name. I had to ask, "Do you need my name?" He said my order would be ready in 10 minutes. I got there ten minutes later and they had no record of my order. I verified I called the right location. It was the same number, right address, everything was correct. Still – no record of me calling, no order made. The guy I spoke to wasn't there. There was another new girl who tried helping me. No one there is properly trained, which falls directly on the store's management. Unbelievable that someone would let people this poorly trained run their store. The cooks were also rude. You could tell that they were laughing at the new girl who was clearly struggling. There were 3 people in front of me in line, all of their orders had issues. Completely unacceptable level of service and a pathetic attempt at management. Train your people and understand that you're running a business. Your store is a joke.<//Review>

This L&L always smells like sewage which pairs well with their sh*tty customer service. The cashier called out the wrong ticket number for my food and then just left it sitting on the counter. I waited my patience away and finally I went up to ask why was my order taking so long. The food was just OK<//Text>

People give l&l Hawaiian a bad rap but it's really good!

I always get the bbq combo plate, it's a large portion of food you get a thin cut steak, and a chicken breast in cooked in teriyaki sauce.

The plate comes with a heap of rice and macaroni salad. Just an FYI get an extra side of rice and or salad because they give a lot of meat which gets to be a turn off for me after a while and that way you're guaranteed a second meal!<//text>

<review>I like the food and kept going back until today>>>>>I went in today at 1:55 PM, paid with a bank credit card and was handed a receipt I thought was to sign for payment of my food, thankfully I looked it over and saw that it was actually for an 85 cent tip and not the food I ordered.  I told the women no and the she handed me the receipt for the bill,  which I didn't have to sign.  I asked her why and she said it has always been  like this and I told her that i have been coming to L & L for many years and have never seen this. I than asked her why they also had a gratuity box for tips with cash in it as well as asking you to sign a receipt to pay a 10% tip. which I also expressed that people do not know that they are signing for a tip and not their food...She was not at all giving good customer service as she had a bad bad attitude and told  me to talk to my bank about the tip receipt..This is very wrong  double dipping for tips and a fast food resturant at that  wanting customers to sign for a tip without their knowledge</review>< Pics>

<user_name>alecia ponder<//user_name><Text>8/27/2016 For $18.63 including delivery fee my food was delivered an hour late, food was warm/cold. I ordered the seafood combo with the bbq short ribs and one slab of rib was nothing but fat and bone, my shrimp tasted overcooked and my fish was cold..the white sticky rice and mac salad was probably the only thing good on my whole plate. The icing on the cake is that the delivery driver forgot my strawberry grava drink. and really i let him slide because he was a new guy but when i called to see if i can get a discount or my money back the lady on the phone says that it is between me and the guy to deal with it...RUDE! she said i should call him back with the number on my receipt, which i than explained to her that the number took me back to her the RESTAURANT itself..smh as my first time experienceing what was supposed to be good food i feel as if i will NOT return as a customer..3 stars 👎👎< /Text><Rate>1</Rate>< Pictures>

Bad customer service! Had a coupon and they would not accept even though the college dollar stretcher sign  was still posted on the front door. Will not be returning to this location.< /review>

(Translated by Google) First time in this place. All of the employees at the time were Latino. I asked her to recommend a dish and the cashier kindly gave me 2 options. Very rich indeed!

(Translated by Google) This is a barbecue restaurant using Hawaiian special spicy sauce.匂 Smell may be worried by shop. BBQ MIX is very tasty with rich beef, pork and chicken meat. However, I think it will be quite overcaloric for Japanese.
Basically, it is a take-out type, so whatever you order, it can be served in a take-away container. You can eat in the shop, so if you tell them to eat in the shop when ordering, they will give you the container without putting it in the bag.換 え In other words, the only difference is whether you put it in a take-out bag or not. . . If you get tired of the so-called American BBQ, try this restaurant and you will find that it is a favorite for Japanese people, so please try it once.

(Original)
ハワイ独特の甘辛のソースを使ったバーベキューのお店です。　お店によって匂いが気になるかもしれません。BBQ MIXはビーフ、ポーク、チキンのお肉もボリュームたっぷりでなかなか美味しいです。ただ日本人にはかなりのオーバーカロリーになると思います。
基本的にはテイクアウト形式なので、何をオーダーしても持ち帰り用の容器に盛り付けられます。　お店の中でも食べることができますので、注文の際にお店の中で食べる旨を伝えれば袋に入れずにそのまま容器を渡してくれます。　言い換えてみると持ち帰り用の袋に入れるか、入れないかの違いだけですが。。。いわゆるアメリカのBBQに飽きたらこのお店を試してみると日本人には好みの味付けだと思いますので、一度試してみてください。<//Text>

Want a great burrito, taco, or quesadilla? Don't waste your time going elsewhere and hit up Establos. While you're there grabbing some excellent food, get your shopping basics out of the way as well!< /Review>

Legit carniceria and taco spot. Order and pay for your lunch at the counter in front. Pick the food up in the back. Good selection and prompt service.< /text>

The burritos are incredible. Much better value than qdoba or chipotle. $6. Comes with chips, salsa, jalapeños, radishes, and lemons. Order at the front register and then go wait in the back. A new favorite place for me.<//Text>

I first went to Establos about two years ago. I loved the vibe then. I rediscovered it when I started my Keto Diet. They make me just Carne Asada in be back. It is a perfect meal. I am even able to call it in and stop by to pick it up.< /text>

Not at all what I expected! I was asked to pick up food bcuz it's good and I was so disappointed! The guacamole is soup the frijoles were soup and when I called to ask what's up w/that the guy said that's how it is and offered nothing to make it better. The carne soft tacos tasted like lime which I didn't care for and I just threw $15.00 down the drain. I Don't Recommend This Place at all!

You ask them for an carne asada burrito and they fill it with a scoop of asada and the rest with cow tongue. And the meat is very dry and full of fat. They have stail chips and rotten lemons. By far the worst place and burrito to ever order. Never going back to any of there stores.<//review>< gmap_id>

<Text>This might be our favorite "authentic" Mexican food place in town.  Yeah, it's a market, but it's got a taqueria in it, and it's FABULOUS.  The carnitas and al pastor pork are crazy good, and my 10 year old loves the chicken or chorizo tacos.  The sopes (my favorite) are always tender, and big enough to be a (smallish) meal.  The prices are really reasonable, too.< /Text>< resp>

Nice park for family events and kids play area. Good for scenic views. Lots of Ducks seen around. Long trail available for a good walk🚶 or biking 🚴‍♀️. Nice view of the mountain and lake from the park. Also, place available for party with friends and family. Lot of parking space available as well. A good park to visit around the Fremont and Newark area.<//Text>

The best park visited by me in the bay area is the central park of Fremont.  Lake Elizabeth in the middle of the park along with the mountainous background is very beautiful to behold.  There are long, paved walks along the entirety of the lake.  There are restrooms situated right in the middle of the park and therefore easily accessible from anywhere.  Plenty of ducks both on the park and in the lake make for very pleasant views.   The park itself is very spacious and is very suitable for evening picnics.  There is plenty of space for parking.<//Review>

Hands down this park is one of the best ones in the Bayarea. Enjoy a beautiful scenic view while you watch your kids play in one of several playgrounds they have at this park.</text>

<text>This is a huge park with lots of open space along side of a golf coarse and Lake Elizabeth.

There is a boathouse and multiple kids play areas. The trail around the lake is awesome. Because of the large water body there are a lot of birds. We were pleased to see a large group of Pelicans swimming in the lake.

The only issue I had was that some people did not wear masks when on the trail around the lake.

Ample parking available as there are multiple parking lots available. Overall a good place to spend some quality time with the family.</text>< name>

<Text>Such a beautiful ❤️ and amazing location. The moon in the night looks fantastic. Super fresh oxygen, full moon and the birds chirping gave me some pleasant time for meditation.</Text>< userid>

<text>Filled with geese, ducks, pelicans, and animal life of all sorts. The loop around is about 1.5-2 miles depending on the path. More than dozens of places to sit and eat, quite a few grills. Open spaces and shaded spaces. A giant playground and close to a small water park. Honestly this place has it all. One of my favorite parks. Can't beat the view of the mountains either!</text><user>106144922092176103974< /user><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

I've been going to this park since I was a kid, before we had to pay to use the picnic areas, tennis courts or soccer fields. It seems like as the years go by there's less and less free public places to enjoy a nice day with family and friends. Its truly sad. Its still a nice park to enjoy walk, but I hate to see so many places you can only enjoy if you pay for them.<//review>

One of the best park to jog & enjoy nature.
Beautiful lake as well with too many birds.
Too many small playgrounds for children. Very crowded.</text>

There’s always plenty of dogs to play with that are generally quite nice. The big dog park is super good, but the small one is way less interesting.<//review>

Very cool place. Very spacious and the people are super friendly and chill. It's not the cleanest dog park I've been to but not excessively grimey.
I have a pit and he gets shunned and treated badly at a lot of parks but that doesn't happen here</text>

The park has a nice flat trail around the lake with many plants and wildlife creatures to see. There are several clean restrooms for use.

During my visit, I saw many Canadian geese which reminded me of home. There are also many varieties of ducks, and several feral cats lying about.

The only complaint I had was that it was rather crowded at around 3 pm on a Saturday, which is not ideal during the current pandemic.</text>

Overall it's a nice place to bring the kids and go for a walk. I prefer Lake Chabot in Castro Valley over Lake Elizabeth.<//review><username>Chris C< /username>< Rating>

Huge park with lots of shade, perfect for a family outing in the weekend.

One full round around the lake Elizabeth will sprouts the bean in your mind, relax the muscle and soothes the lung.

Of course with boating and kids park open things would have been much better but never the less an awesome place for family time.< /Review>

<Review>Great park, very large, has several large sections with plenty of area for picnic or parties. Has allot of benches and ducks. Due to it being covid play area closed. Great place for family and couples. If you like walking 2-3 miles you can around the Lake.< /Review>< pics>

It's a nice place to enjoy the outdoors. During this pandemic it's been hard to really enjoy your walk when there's millions of people. If your riding a bike please learn how to tell people your coming. Example " bike on left" or have a bell. That's my only complaint about Central Park.< /text>

<Text>I feel lucky to live just in walking distance from this huge park. It has lake Elizabeth on 1 side along with multiple soccer fields. It also has a cricket ground. A nice long walking/ cycling track and some swings for kids. It has a golf course on 1 side as well. It also has picnic areas where you could enjoy BBQ or some other cooking. I really enjoy going there for a walk and play Frisbee and soccer with my son every week.< /Text><userid>117657554113367066940</userid><user_name>Owais Majid< /user_name><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBWYN1aKUBhIze-sa4WTPhhaWJ7qe31n-PR0zH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM1dxcJ5xMD9wwZxUlJM8JPlTM-JcM277KA_tGe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4hS62riWGv6skVy0cA-Vgh4hi3k_e1IPHa20l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><gmapID>0x808fc0c19ba4e761:0x589c9ad71c62a420< /gmapID>< rate>

Great park, nice open spaces, great walking path around the lake. Very scenic. Lot of parking but sometimes runs short. In summer too much dog poop, folks are very inconsiderate when it comes to picking after their dog.< /review>

<Text>Must wear mask. Even in covid situation, it was really crowded. So getting parking may be bit tricky, we got lucky since we reached there late afternoon. The loop is really long, can expect minimum 7,000steps. But this place is really good for spending good time with friends and family, even all alone. Sunset reflection in water is really beautiful. Close to nature.<//Text>< pics>

A nice place to walk by yourself , with your friend, and or your dog.  Gets a little crowded, but not too bad, (Jan 2021, still recommend wearing your mask). 😃< /Text>

Been visiting this park since 1973. Love walking the path. My kids grew up playing on all the park equipment. Lots of fun picnics, and get togethers. Walked this morning  (1) lap around lake. What a great day for a walk.</text>

Awesome views of the Park. Lots of birds. Some trails are flat, some are elevated, some sunny, some shaded behind hills. There is something for every kind of hiker. Central Park trail is paved and stroller friendly.</review>

Well, this is one of my favorite places in Bay Area, no doubt. Beautiful lake with wildlife (and poop that comes with it, of course) and Mission Peak in background. Kayaking is available in summertime, which is cool and you can also launch your own boat for some fee.
Shopping plaza is nearby, so you could ear there and go walk around the lake to burn some calories and have some excersize.
In short, it's a very nice place.</Review>

My favorite place in Fremont. There's a lot of people during the weekend. If you want to excercises or run with proper social distance I recomend you to start  early in the morning, before 9 am or after 8 pm (if you like a night run). The restrooms are available before 9 or 10 pm.</Review>

<Text>The lake is huge and a walk around it took me 45-60 minutes. There was plenty of free parking spaces in the lots. A lot of families were in the park for a picnic. Another thing to note is the trail around the lake is wider than most other parks in the Bay Area which makes social distancing in covid-19 times easier.</Text><GmapID>0x808fc0c19ba4e761:0x589c9ad71c62a420</GmapID><user>107206857441493727024</user>< rating>

<review>Be sure to visit the snack bar (near the docks) and feed leafy greens to the park's resident domestic goose! Responds well to "George" and "ack". Careful though, he has no concept of personal space and tends to get very close to people.< /review>< GmapID>

Always great for a run around the lake, to workout in the park or to lay mat and have a picnic with family and friends. There’s also plenty of activities in the park that constantly happening, like taichi, concerts, etc.< /Text>

Currently under construction for the drive through, so it's dirty and I ended up with a nail in my tire. The line backs up to the stop light. They were especially nice or friendly this visit. They take your card to run it so have your wipes ready to clean your card when you get it back. Just cuz they are wearing gloves doesn't mean that the gloves haven't picked up gems from someone else's cootie filled card. 😝<//text>

Awesome park.  I live in Oakland and just kept thinking this is what Lake Merritt should be like.  They have like 5 different play grounds in the park, one being the best I have ever seen, boat rental, numerous bathrooms and picnic areas and a small stream to play in.< /text>

Excellent family destination. We walked across Gomes' school in the neighborhood to get to Lake Elizabeth. It is a wonderful surprise in a residential neighborhood : well maintained trail all around the lake with dog lovers aplenty , blooming flora and fauna including a section that has bamboo growing, next to a Union Pacific railway line that can be an entertainment destination for train obsessed toddlers. The only reason I rate is 4 stars is because of the duck poop (and some dog poop from lazy owners) that line up the trail.<//review>

Awesome !. May be this is the longest walking trail around a  lake in the city.  The walking  trails are kept  clean. Quite a number of  geese, coots, gulls and ducks. At dusk,  cats ( bigger in size) are running around. Parents should be wary on this, when they are bringing their kids.  ( Here also we have seen visitors feeding the birds.  This is against the instructions or  cautionary notice exhibited) Couple of shelters (reserved ones) are available. May be the authorities allot them for Partying. Visiting for the first time here. Really appreciable one!!<//text>

I would give this park five stars but there are aggressive geese and lots of geese feces at this park. A good place to walk but maybe not the best place to bring small children who are likely to pick things up off the ground. However they do have a few dedicated play structures for children that look pretty maintained. The general area of the park is where there is an excessive amount of goose feces.</review>

Very nice park and lake! Still open during Covid, but with some amenities closed (playgrounds, bbq and picnic areas).
Great for running.<//text>

An incredible park in the heart of Fremont. Too much crowd in the park though COVID season. Better not to go to this park on Weekends, weekdays is okay I guess.</Text>

Beautiful park. Nice little escape in the middle of the city. Restrooms are even well maintained. It was a nice place to go for a socially distanced picnic and walk.

I Look forward to this shut down being over and letting my son play in the playgrouds!</Text>

<user_name>Dani Micheletti<//user_name><Time>1578260951526</Time><Rate>4</Rate><Review>Pretty lake with full bathrooms. Two large play structures for kids. Very family friendly. You can see seagulls, Canadian geese & other water fowl. Lots of water & tall grass. Takes around 25 minutes to walk around about 2 miles) a lot of the bird poop was cleaned up. You just have to watch your steps sometimes. Free parking is a huge plus. Nice during the Spring to take your family to bike, fish, or jog. There's a cute snack stand too...not sure if it's open or functioning. Also, saw a defunct Pepsi soda machine that doesn't work . Oh well. Overall very beautiful park in the heart of Fremont 🇺🇸< /Review>< Pics>

A serene and gorgeous park,
Quiet and family friendly with lots of play areas.
Equipped with barbeque grills and benches for a Sunday day out.
The ducks were adorable and it was amazingly clean.
Very safe location.
Grab a nice book or enjoy a walk in this gorgeous park.</Text>

<review>The park is basically open, the restrooms were in good shape (I guess the additional clean for covid has side benefits).  There were a lot of people but it wasn't crowded.  Only one party seemed to be not social distancing and loud.<//review></record>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Pretty lake with full bathrooms. Two large play structures for kids. Very family friendly. You can see seagulls, Canadian geese & other water fowl. Lots of water & tall grass. Takes around 25 minutes to walk around about 2 miles) a lot of the bird poop was cleaned up. You just have to watch your steps sometimes. Free parking is a huge plus. Nice during the Spring to take your family to bike, fish, or jog. There's a cute snack stand too...not sure if it's open or functioning. Also, saw a defunct Pepsi soda machine that doesn't work . Oh well. Overall very beautiful park in the heart of Fremont 🇺🇸<//Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Great park to have a stroll, run, picnic or out with the kids to any of the several kids playground.  Also has a Library, water park.  Several restaurants and shops nearby.  The lake can also house small boats.  Lots of wildlife around.</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Awesome !. May be this is the longest walking trail around a  lake in the city.  The walking  trails are kept  clean. Quite a number of  geese, coots, gulls and ducks. At dusk,  cats ( bigger in size) are running around. Parents should be wary on this, when they are bringing their kids.  ( Here also we have seen visitors feeding the birds.  This is against the instructions or  cautionary notice exhibited) Couple of shelters (reserved ones) are available. May be the authorities allot them for Partying. Visiting for the first time here. Really appreciable one!!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCUjk0W0i6pILNvbV0n_3kQCysbzx3JvAJ6rF3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAiLuYvj2WnGbs9jB78uVvRJXsX1iUZUGbto4E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKz_n2XVGQPovjY2q0JP9Q2GzyUzKokPUknokm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLRe5SV_4hSvInsq90AJp8TU37yh5UYlHoGCDC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<review>Pleasant, large park with lots of recreational choices: boating, water park, jogging, bird watching, picnics, relaxing, etc...  Maybe the park is too large hard to upkeep?  One star off for less than stellar greenery maintenance.<//review>< Pictures>

< review>
Lake Elizabeth is Fremont's gem! The city has done so much to this place over the years. I came here as a child and loved it. As an adult, I have enjoyed bringing nieces, nephews, and now, my own children. While the progression and changes are vast, the ambience that is captured within the memories remains the same. ❤</review>

Great place to be to enjoy the outdoor, safely with our little one. We were able to keep social distancing with other guests while our little one can run freely on the grass.</text>

<Text>I doubt the there is a more beautiful and experience rewarding park outside of golden gate for all ages, in many ways better due to weather alone.

Walking around the lake takes about 50 min~1 hour, so it's perfect for walking the dog. Also, playgrounds for kids are conveniently available inside the park.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Nicely mentioned park , good for walk, dogs are allowed, also a good picnic spot, there are some swings and slides so you can bring your kids too. I like walking around the lake, very calming, you get to see the birds and mountains.</review>

Lovely park with several playgrounds, a nice paved walking/running path around the "lake". Great place to take children to play. But great place for all ages.
Not a lot of shade and the lake water was quite stagnant when we were there.
Parking was very easy and not an issue during the week.<//review>

Visited the dog park. Small off leash dog park with a three obstacle agility area.  My dog did enjoy the ramp, tunnel, and bar jump obstacles.

Size-wise the large dog area is big enough to play fetch. The area is covered in astroturf material, since grass would require water.  There are lots of tennis balls there for the dogs that like to fetch.

Some entitled owners don't pick up after their dogs.  There are some in every crowd.

Water stations are all in working order with stainless bowls in place for easy hydration.  They are located at either end of the long dimension of the big dog area. There are nice shade pavilions for dog owners to sit in the shade.<//Text>

A great place in the neighborhood for walking, cycling, or having fun at a playground. There is a 2 mile loop around the lake, with the street side having the Fremont main library, and 3 playgrounds.</text>

Expansive park with 4 separate Children Play Areas for kids up to 12.  Multiple tall slides as well as climbing structures.   Rubber flooring as well and multiple restroom locations.

Many shaded picnic tables and areas but not much shade over the playground.  Grounds are well kept and theres a nice long walking/ running path around the lake.  Multiple free parking lots at this park.</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Everything you could ask for in a park is here: a beautiful lake, boat ramps, picnic areas, bbq areas, walking /jogging paths, a nice community center (which can be rented for parties), & more. There is some disabled parking, but they could use a few more spots. We sometimes go there just to eat lunch, which we bring with us. Very enjoyable!< /Review>< Pics>

<date>1574791994481< /date><review>Nice park with many distinct areas for different activities, large sports complex with soccer, baseball and cricket fields, along side paved paths for walking, with or without pets. Pretty well kept up, biggest drawback is presence of geese year round, and the associated mess they make. Goose poop is everywhere -  sports fields, paths, playgrounds. Signs are posted not to feed geese, but it's often ignored, hence they stay all year.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><name>Jeff Stroud</name><user>117592968143254728845< /user></record>

I loved Central Park! You will never believe that you are so near to the busyness of the city. There are so many great places to explore, we only managed about half of it. I would have spent more time there if it was up to me. The bird feeding are is just lovely. It was snowy while we were there but the paths are kept clear if the snow. It’s easy to get “lost” but that’s the fun of it all<//Review>

I've been coming here for the past 25 years. It has definitely become busier. The loop around the lake is about two miles. It is a pleasant, flat pathway. If you are a not expert runner like me, it makes for a nice, safe run. You won't get bored. Lots of people to see and dodge! Geese, ducks, cats, and various animals to see. In the summer, you can rent paddle boats. Folks come for parties and picnics. There are several playgrounds and open grassy areas to play sports. There are several parking lots. Restaurants and stores are just walking distance. The BART station is also about a 15 min walk. The reason I only gave three stars is because it really has gotten very busy. This can be good and bad.< /Text>

Well kept and diverse.draw back is that some visitors don't follow leash laws and don't pick up after themselves or their dogs.

<Review>I would like to give 5 stars here, but seriously, folks  - this is our own town and lake, we should be responsible adults using this. I have seen so much pet poop here on pathways, it is disgusting. People should pick up after their pets, I thought that is the law, but it is not being followed here.
Such a beautiful and serene place.</Review>< gmapID>

Nice park with many distinct areas for different activities, large sports complex with soccer, baseball and cricket fields, along side paved paths for walking, with or without pets. Pretty well kept up, biggest drawback is presence of geese year round, and the associated mess they make. Goose poop is everywhere -  sports fields, paths, playgrounds. Signs are posted not to feed geese, but it's often ignored, hence they stay all year.</Review>

<Text>It a big park and has the right place for everyone. Sometimes it is too crowded but I understand it... It is the place for a nice walk around the lake, a nice bike or scooter stroll, a picnic, a playground time, a nice grill, a gathering, b-day celebration, football, baseball game or just to bring your blanket and relax. There is a lake and you can walk around it and see lots of birds in and around the water. It is a great place to relax and even get your walking done.<//Text>< pictures>

<text>Though this park looks great it has a stand offish vibe from the locals. It's always seems to be pack every time I go. The people on the trail most of the time are unfriendly and pretentious. That vibe is intensified when you see all the pure bred cats abandoned there. There are tons of abandoned cat making homes in the reeds. You know they aren't local strays cause you see pure bred Persian, Siamese, American short hair and more.</text>< Pictures>

Great location to stroll around on a good bright day. It becomes windy in the evening even on sunny days, so definitely have an extra layer if you are not in your workout zone. It has a nice path for walking, biking and dog walking. On the water park end it has a great play area for kids. Also very important it has plenty of space for your summer barbeque parties. It is my go to place for weekend walks. Totally love this place.<//text>

<review>Lots of families on weekends, not too many runners and enough rangers to feel safe. Happy to see Senior center being used. Enough space to just lay on grass and read and nice to have both reserved and drop-in bbq areas.
Please let's get more sanitary restrooms. Also why are outlets no longer working in public areas?<//review>< time>

<Review>I came here with some friends to get steps in and exercise our joints. We walked one time around the lake. I liked how they have mile markers to tell you how far you've gone. We even stopped a few times to get some exercise on sit up table, parallel bars, and the pull up bar.< /Review><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

<text>The views of Mission Peak over a calm, sometimes light fog-shrouded Lake Elizabeth is etherial. Go early morning. You also get to meet the local residents- ducks, Canada geese, coots, ground squirels. It beats a walk on any treadmill. One round around the lake is two miles. Go for it!😀</text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x808fc0c19ba4e761:0x589c9ad71c62a420<//Gmap_id></record>

A good park to spend your leisure time. The area around the lake is little messy because of birds.<//text>

Central Park or Lake Elizabeth as it’s alternatively known represents the city of Fremont’s pinnacle in city planning endeavors compared to the recent rampant “developer and builder led encroachment” of city scape and quality of life. Central Park has been a goto destination not only for Fremont residents but Bay Area dwellers alike - there is nothing like it in terms of expanse, facilities and variety of entertainment options. From kids play areas, walking and running trails, picnic tables, designated recreation areas, water park, senior center and rowing facilities to ample parking, its the perfect offline family entertainment destination that also keeps the spirit of Fremont alive wishing a hectic routine in our daily lives. Better digital surveillance and monitoring would keep the safety of this park intact in times to come. Surely recommended for anyone living or visiting Fremont especially in the spring, summer and fall seasons.</Text>

Only reason for not giving 4/5 starts is because people are still walking without masks and they are not enforced.</Review>

Not typically too much noise. They occassionally have events here for kids and families, like I've seen them do some sort of Disney sing-along before. Several playgrounds spread around for your kids. Multiple picnic areas that you can walk up and use or you can reserve for parties. Definitely worth a visit, even if you are just wanting to walk and clear your mind.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Text>My family loves walking around lake Elizabeth. We’ve got a baby and 2 dogs and always do a loop of the lake. It’s a good long walk with lots of people watching and a beautiful backdrop.

There are playgrounds for kids, a dog park and lots of areas to bbq. It’s always packed on the weekends with tons of people everywhere but still enjoyable.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808fc0c19ba4e761:0x589c9ad71c62a420</gmapID></record>

Lots of people on the weekends but everyone was really nice so it's all good. Great place to walk and has a great playground with soft ground for the kids. Also the bathrooms actually have soap, that was a big plus! Been coming here since the playground was wood back in the 80's and it's still a great place to go.< /Text>

Best place for walking and beautiful scenery to watch. The lake with enchanting yellow flowers around and birds in the lake attract me. The squirrels loitering on both the sides of foot path and cool breeze on sunny day is simply superb and enjoyable. Ducks and other  birds are a part of entertainment to children who visit along with their parents.<//text>

<Review>Excellent ground. Beautiful location and scenery from the field. Lots of groups playing soccer. Even if you don't have a group, more likely than not, you'll find one. Great place for a morning run as well. Only drawback is that it's about 3 miles from both 880 and 680 freeways.< /Review>< Pics>

Lovely place. It's huge. But it can get a little cold in the winter since it's surrounded by water. Great place for a walk, jog or to just sit there and spend some time and also a picnic. They also allow boating on specific times.< /Text>

<review>Dry and open like the Savana. Needs some landscaping to create elevation (mounds, small hills) . These features will break up the sight lines and make each picnic area feel more intimate and cozier. The lake serves as a center piece, but lacks shade and shore line features to encourage actual proximity.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

The people here are very cordial and the air is crisp and clean without any hint of tobacco or marijuana. The dog park is an interesting area and you can sit and watch the dogs play or watch the owner fetching the ball for the dogs. They also have a permit use BBQ area and two open full basketball courts.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Great place for family fun outings, birthdays or just peaceful nature. Amenities include: paddle boating, multiple trails, plenty of space for barbecuing with or without permanent grill, skate park, several playgrounds, tennis, library, restrooms, plenty of geese/ wildlife, soccer fields. Reservations are required for larger groups, we had approximately 100 in our group and had plenty of space/ shade/ tables available near the sport complex. Well laid out park. Water park is there, but I've never seen it open.< /review>

You cannot do but appreciate the beauty of this place. Amazing mountainline with Mission Peak in the background, nice water lake with ducks and other birds swimming around. Kids playing, people running, walking, and scratching and exercising, I'm soaking in the natural beauty.<//Text>

A great paved walkway around Lake Elizabeth, enough space for both walkers, runners, and bikers. Lots of areas for picnicking if you have a group of people. Also lots of green grassy areas you can sit on, beware the bird droppings! A great escape from the busyness that is typically associated with Fremont. there are multiple entrances that you can enter in, both on Stevenson as well as Paseo Padre</Text>

Lake Elizabeth is great! It's about a 2.5 mile walk around. Lots of different exercise stations around the course. The only downside is that there is a lot of geese which means lots of poop on the sidewalk and grass.

Other things at the park:
*3 playground for kids
*waterpark (Aqua Adventure)
*skate park
*boating area
*areas for fishing
*picnic areas w/ grills (some for reservation) & bathrooms
*teen center
*senior center
*dog parks (one for big dogs and one for small dogs)
*baseball fields
*soccer fields
*basketball courts

Around the park:
*police department
*animal shelter
*golf course
*library< /text>

Plenty of room to play or party. A lot of available picnic tables and party sites to use. You can make reservations and save a spot or show up early on the weekend and snag one of the open picnic spots, make sure you get there early if it's on the weekend. Many different parks for the kids to play at, fishing, running/walking/riding. Summer time you can rent paddle boats and float around the lake.< /text>

This park is huge and has a beautiful lake. The way for your daily walk or jog is well paved around this beautiful lake. Abundant space for kids play areas. Small and large areas for a group bbq party with friends. You can reserve the place too for your small parties for a fee. A little refresher in the nature from your daily urban lifestyle.< /text>

We came because we wanted to walk around Lake Elizabeth. It was a lovely walk and very scenic. Lots of ducks and wild geese but they never interfered with being able to enjoy our walk. There are two playgrounds in this park. One seems to be for younger kids and one for older kids. There is also a senior center on this location site. There were a lot of people in the shade of the trees and picnic area doing Tai Chi classes.<//Text>

Great place for kids. A really wonderful running park. I most definitely felt safe to jog and get plenty of mileage in.  The flip side, there are hundreds maybe thousands of geese and ducks. There is duck poo everywhere and the stench can get a little strong. If geese could rule the world, it would most def be at Fremont park.</review>

BBQs are pretty big.Nice big park with so many outdoor amenities and every sports accommodation to play is so there. Right next to the lake. Trash cans are bountiful so please don't make any excuse to leave your garbage littered everywhere. Just throw it in the can. Kids and pets play here and the last thing they need is trash and trash creatures making recreational play areas a hot gross ashtray.< /review>< pics>

Excellent grounds, clean, beautiful birds and animals such as squirrels and ducks to see.  I also saw a Turkey Vulture flying around! The Visitor Center is  awesome to go into because they will answer all of your questions about the natural habitat and the history about the location. I usually like to go for walks.</text>

Fun place to hang out with friends. Lots of grassy space to run around and BBQ. It's a little unfair but I docked it 1 star for having an excessive amount of goose droppings. Not sure how Parks Dept can fix this but still an issue when you're walking around staring at the path avoiding green mines.<//Review>

Park is nice, baseball fields are okay, but lack of restrooms is why it gets a lower score. The one restroom in the baseball area is actually grounds for a 1-star review, though!<//Review>

<review>Great place for kids. A really wonderful running park. I most definitely felt safe to jog and get plenty of mileage in.  The flip side, there are hundreds maybe thousands of geese and ducks. There is duck poo everywhere and the stench can get a little strong. If geese could rule the world, it would most def be at Fremont park.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

It's great for walking, thing the ball around, frisbee, etc. It's not too far from lots of food. They have events here all the time so there is usually something family oriented to do.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>Parking is free so I love it. Good place for a quick run on a paved circuit round the lake. One loop is exactly 2 miles and has almost no elevation making it an easy run. There are also rides for kids, BBQ pits and plenty of area to run/ play. The views around the lake are also nice giving you a good view of the Niles mountain range.</text><response>None<//response>< user>

I like taking my son here to play. There's so much open area to run around, paved pathways for riding a bike, plus a little creek with running water to dip feet in on a hot day. The playgrounds usually have at least a few kids to play with. My main complaint is the lack of shade around the playground, which makes it really hot on hot days. And, of course, if your kid likes to be barefoot, watch out for all the goose poop.<//Review>

This is a nice large park with a pretty big lake in the middle. Lot of play areas for kids, base ball court, tennis courts but what i use the most is the nice walking path around the lake.
There's even a water park that opens in summers.
Several entrances from Stevenson and Paseo Padre. Now that the BART construction in this area is over (or most of the debris is gone), this park is more accessible.</text>

This place is pretty chill, and if you go around the lake it's peaceful and relaxing. Watching people talk or play is kinda nice too if you have no friends.</Text>

A very nice park with something for everyone. The lake has a trail 2 miles with amazing views of the mountains. The sunrise over the mountains and its reflection on the lake is sometimes astounding. Lots of birds and natural habitat. with turtles. There are paddle boats, sail boats and kayaks to rent during summer time. There is also a acqua park lot of play area.</Text>

<review>Everything is good about here, except one park ranger reminded me of Cartman.  "Do you deny my authority?"
"Why you sneak up on Skatepark offroading on grass and mulch killing mycelium?"
"I do what I want" quoth the ranger.

<Text>Fun place to walk,run, play ball play catch or any kind of sporting activity. It's a great place to ride a bike around the lake. I even see some people fishing there. Plenty of playgrounds of this park. I bought brought my barbecue and the Rangers had no problem with that. Unfortunately there's not a whole lot of parking here so have your party early in the morning because I'm afternoon it gets pretty full. And then you have to park and some of the parking lots that are quite a ways away. I had to park over half a mile away from where I had my barbecue. It's very busy here on a nice day.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808fc0c19ba4e761:0x589c9ad71c62a420</GmapID></record>

<Review>Great playground equipment, with somewhat spongy ground. Nice large open grass fields. Unfortunately a significant amount of bird droppings and some birds that approach people. Probably those birds have been feed in the past and are hoping to get more food.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Family friendly parks for all to enjoy. Bird watching enjoy nature relax on the cool Green grass and lovely shade trees. And enjoyed BBQ or picnic with family and friends. Plenty of things for kids to do.  From the jungle gym,  playing on the water slide or  renting a paddle boat  and enjoying the sunshine.</review></record></dataset><record>

Love this park, aside from construction, it's clean and well groomed. Lots of areas for kids of all ages to keep entertained. Only complaint wod be the lack of water at handwashing stations and even the drinking fountain. In other words bring plenty of water from home.</review>

Great park for tne enitre family and your pets. Run, jog, walk, stroll, TaiChi, Yoga, play areas for kids of all ages. Picnic areas with Barbecue pits. Thursdays arr movies or live music during summer.

Really good place for runners to train for their 5k n 10k races. Loop around the lake is 2miles.

Has a separate skateboard park too..< /Text>< username>

<text>This park has a 2 mile track around the lake - a great walk or job. The lake has many birds, & offers some boating. On weekends, the park is full with picnics. There are children's areas. Parking can be touch. Overall, a nice place in Fremont for a walk or outing.< /text>< user_name>

Here with my dogs. My male loves coming here, so we do. Nothing spectacular. Artificial grass and no bathroom.
However it is right next to the SPCA which is a good idea I reckon. And it's close to Lake Elizabeth.< /review>

Tons of ducks and chipmunks. Went in the afternoon and wasn't that busy. So it was a nice relaxing walk. It's 2.0 miles around the lake and there are mile markers to let you know. Kid friendly. Dog friendly. Bathrooms are disgusting tho.< /review>

Nicely maintained, parking can be limited during peak periods such as holidays. Not too happy they replaced a large section of highly useful park's grassy area with a cricket field that is very seldom used (and locked when not in use, so unavailable). Nice dog park, but no effort made to keep "bad dogs" out nor enforce the small dog only section.<//review>

Plenty of benches to sit, bbq areas, playground structures, basketball courts, wonderful view of the lake, restrooms (don't forget your own hand sanitizer) , and even a big waterpark next door if you want to get wet! It costs to visit the waterpark, so bring enough extra cash if you're looking to go. As for Central Park, if you're looking for a private event, there's a nice size space to host parties indoor. Advance reservation and payment required. I'd definitely rate this park 5/5 stars!<//review><name>K K</name><Pics>None< /Pics><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

I loved this place n I would come here during my lunch break primarily because it was so peaceful. The lake is there, Lake Elizabeth, n also a water park n lots of playgrounds so the kids can have fun. Definately would recommend everyone to go see such a beautiful place in the middle of a city< /Text>

I used to love this park a few yrs ago and frequented it on a daily basis. Would go for a walk, relax my mind, enjoy the fresh air, loved the lake and mountain views, enjoyed listening to kids laughing and watch them play. What happened to this place? It should be renamed, " Duck Poop Dump." What an eyesore has this place become! It's so disgusting that it's hard to stay here for 10 mins. Please do what it takes to restore this place. Thank you.</review>

It's a sprawling park that was constructed in the 60s. There are playgrounds, activity centers, a shallow artificial lake, a boat launch, boats for rent, baseball fields, soccer fields, tennis courts, a dog park, and a water park.

The new turf soccer fields, by reservation only, are spectacular. The baseball fields seem to be too, though we've never used them. There are eight grass soccer fields that don't require a reservation - they're good fields too. And the playgrounds were a real attraction when we had young children.

It's a nice place but has no organic feel to it. It feels like everything has just kind of been dropped down. But for the soccer fields that doesn't matter.< /review>

Nice park to be around for barbecue, picnic, jogging, hang around with friends or with your kids. Dogs are allowed. Lot of benches to sit, multiple kids play area, restrooms. The lake is pretty big & boating is there though for a fixed time.
Due to the lake there is cool breeze during the summer.
Lot of parking though they get filled up quickly during summer evenings.
Park is located right in the center of Fremont & beside the Fremont library.
Lot of geese here & often the grasses will be full of their droppings.</Text>

Nice play areas for kids, areas to host parties and whatnot, and a nice walk around the lake. But if it bugs you even a little bit to step in poop, you should go elsewhere.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>The park is the best thing one could have in a town to relax and enjoy nature and beautiful scenery with family, friends and the rest of the town. The best thing is it is located close to home and features a jogging / walking trail, a beautiful Lake and many soccer and baseball fields.   A must place to see in Fremont.<//review>< pics>

We took our kitties and my mom and sisters dogs walking here. The paths are nice, the area beautiful, pet friendly,  and has a kids playground. Only downside is the restrooms were scary.< /Text>

The best 2 mile walking path in the east bay.
Flat, wide smooth concrete path around a lovely duck and swan filled lake.</Text>

<Text>One of the best parks on the East Side.  Fully equipped for families and large groups, for picnics and athletic activities; with many picnic tables and restrooms available.  Nice scenic walk around the lake.  Well-maintained.</Text>< response>

Great place for family picnic, outing and for walking/running. Weekends are very crowded though. Some sitting/picnic areas are permanently reserved. But a huge park makes it a great place for large events.< /Text>

Whether you're looking for a place to fly your kite, take a run or bike ride, Fremont Central Park is a great place to go!  There are dozens of picnic areas available as well as several large play structures (recently renovated) for the kiddo's.</review>

Nice trail around the lake. There's plenty parking spaces and lots of BBQ grills for picnics. There's also children's playground for little ones. But there are lot of birds at the park, so watch out for bird poop when you walk.<//Review>

< review>
There are plentiful spots for children to play, including two large jungle gyms. The lake is large with wide paths all around it, and enough trees to provide shade. There are also barbecue locations you can reserve ahead of time! A recent addition which can appeal to those of all ages is the tremendous amount of PokeStops.< /review>

Great place to take a long walk...But, staff needs to enforce dog owners to clean up after their pets and to enforce pets to be on a leash. I walk my dog.. and it's so upsetting to see the fields have dog feces...<//Review>

There are places for children to play and those areas are made of synthetic turf which is soft so that even if children fall down they won't get hurt badly.
There are arrangements for handicapps in toilets.< /Text>

<review>Pretty nice park. Lots of groups doing Tai Chi in the morning, barbecue in the summer, etc. Lake is 2 miles and people like to walk or jog around.

Sometimes lots of geese and consequently the ground gets littered.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Great park. Very crowded on the weekends now. I come here on the weekdays, and it's relaxing. Careful of all the duck poop. The park employees try to clean it as often as they can.< /Text>

Best park close to south bay. This park is huge and beautiful with lots bbq area, hiking trail, and 3 children playgrounds. Lots greens and birds here. The only thing to watch is it gets cold in the evening because of the huge lake so bring jacket got your kids.< /Review>

You can rent a boat on the lake, drop your teen at the skatepark, run  or bike all over the lake, walk your pet to the dog park, spend the day to the Aqua park and more!<//Review>< Pictures>

The best park in the whole Tri-City area. Plenty of open fields, and amazing play structures for kids. It is situated on Lake Elizabeth, a manmade lake filled with an abundance of Canadian Geese and Mallard Ducks. The walk around the lake is about 2.5 miles, and quite beautiful. Plenty of picnic benches scattered throughout the park. Facilities include water, toilets, boat rentals, dog park, skatepark, basketball court, and tennis court.</Text>

<review>Very large community park with rentable pavilions that a great for partys. A 2+ mile nature trail circumventing a beautiful lake with a number of work out stations, pedal-boats, areas for fishing, and parks for the kids ensure a great time for the entire family. Also includes soccer fields, baseball diamonds, tennis courts, a skate park, and a water park.</review><date>1494704937378</date>< resp>

<text>The best park all over the Bay Area. Why ? Because you children from 2 to 12 will enjoy the huge and fun playground. You can rent a boat on the lake, drop your teen at the skatepark, run  or bike all over the lake, walk your pet to the dog park, spend the day to the Aqua park and more!< /text><date>1497496530429< /date><Resp>None< /Resp><UserId.>100830544233360385263</UserId.><user_name>Isabelle Gaudreau<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

Good and clean walking trail,

Best time to walk is sunrise,
Golden color grass,
clouds covering the sunrise,
light coming as an arrow...

splendid experience....< /review>

Best park in Fremont. Lots of great playgrounds and walkways around the lake. Obviously popular, though, so it's usually crowded.< /Text>

<Review>Central Park or Lake Elizabeth as we grew up calling it is a great palce to take the kids, to go for a walk or run, to have a birthday in one of the many picnic/bbq areas and to just have a relaxing stroll or to read a good book on one of the many benches that are around the lake.<//Review>< time>

My lunchtime retreat when I dont want to walk Lake Elizabeth on my lunch break. Tennis courts offered not far. Baseball field w/ dugouts. Soccer field is spacious and lush. Plenty of ducks so I wouldnt sit on the grass - but a decent place to burn calories on my lunchbreak</review>

<user_id>112233785290385019228< /user_id><review>Great 'sidewalk' all the way around the lake. Awsome for bicycling, roller blaiding/skating, skate boarding, jogging or just strolling. Theres several play grounds for the youngsters, lots of pick-nick areas, plenty of clean public restrooms, lots of grass areas, and for the more adventurous there is a skate park thats open from dawn till dusk. Theres fishing and boat rentals, (no swimming im the lake), however there is also a water park comparable to Raging Warters. they have a gift shop, community center, youth center, and senior center, probably more.< /review>< date>

Nice and quality place for jogging and walking, not recommended to visit around sunset, lots of mosquitoes and insects flying particularly east side of lake.< /text>

<Time>1510080839593< /Time><Rate>5</Rate><text>(Translated by Google) Very beautiful big park! There is Lake Elizabeth in the park, you can walk along the lake. There are two other playgrounds in the park, one is the water park, but when I went today, he seemed to be closed for business, and there was no one; the other was the forest park, but I did n’t go there. There are also several outdoor open children's play areas. There is also a golf course in the park, so pay special attention to entering certain areas and not be hit by flying balls. The other part is very large grass and green land, there are many wild animals here; there are very many water birds, and they do not seem to be afraid of humans. Here you can relax and enjoy nature, whether it is animals or plants; you can sunbathe, watch the lake, and then have a picnic. There is a specially-built barbecue area somewhere in the lake, but I did n’t see anyone using it in the past. I don't know if I can take a boat to the middle of the lake. When I went today, the visitor center (perhaps the place where the boat was rented) didn't seem to open. Because the green area of ​​this park is very very large, I hope that there will be some vendors selling food around him, otherwise I will walk for a long time and be hungry and have nothing to eat and drink 😂 I have a small shop selling snacks in the park No season will open the door 😢

非常漂亮的大公園！公園內有伊莉莎白湖，可以沿著湖走一圈。公園內另外有兩個遊樂場所 ，一個是水公園，不過我今天去的時候他 似乎暫停營業，沒有什麼人；另一個是森林公園，不過我沒有走過去。另外還有幾處戶外的 開放式兒童遊樂區。公園內還有高爾夫球場 ，進入某些區域要特別注意，不要被飛來的球打到。其他部分就是非常廣大的青草綠地 ，有許多野生動物在這裡；有非常多的水鳥，而且他們似乎並不害怕人類。在這裏可以盡情的放鬆享受大自然，無論是動物還是植物 ；可以曬太陽、看湖泊，然後一邊野餐。在湖泊的某處還有特別專門設立的烤肉區 ，但我今天過去時也沒有看到有人在用。這裡不曉得能不能夠搭船到湖中央，我今天去的時候，遊客中心(或許是租船的地方)似乎沒有開。因為這個公園綠地非常非常的大，希望他的周邊能有一些賣食物的攤販，不然走久了好餓又沒有東西可以吃可以喝😂 公園內自己有一個賣點心的小商店， 但好像在這個季節都不會開門😢< /text>< Pics>

There are two miles of trails around the lake. You can run and walk. There are various kinds of birds in the lake and the sky. There are also several children's play areas. The protection measures are excellent. When the weather is good, many parents will bring their children to play here. .

<text>(Translated by Google) The scenery is good, many people are running or walking here. The disadvantage is that there are many birds, so there are several roads that are full of birds.

(Translated by Google) Beautiful park. There is space to do sports, dance and appreciate birds, for some reason there are many geese. In the morning it is possible to see the Chinese community practice their dance and culture.
There are clean bathrooms, drinking fountains, and children's games. Easy to park.

Hermoso parque. Hay espacio para hacer deporte, danza y apreciar las aves, por algún motivo hay muchimas ocas. Por la mañana es posible ver a la comunidad china practicar su danza y cultura.

<Date>1471824317590< /Date><Text>(Translated by Google) It is a park with a great view of the mountains over a large lake. There are many places where you can BBQ. The lawn is spread throughout the park, but bird feathers have fallen everywhere and I was asked to lay a leisure sheet.

(Original)
大きな湖越しに山々が見え、とても眺めの良い公園です。BBQできる所が多くあります。公園全体に芝生が広がっているのですが、至る所に鳥の羽が落ちておりレジャーシートを敷くのが躊躇われました。< /Text><username>chihiro m<//username><resp>None<//resp><Rate>4<//Rate><user_id>107667753356808781296< /user_id></record></dataset><record>
