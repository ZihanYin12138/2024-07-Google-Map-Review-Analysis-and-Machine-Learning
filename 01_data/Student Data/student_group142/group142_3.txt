It is a matter of simply interacting with people as you yourself want to be addressed. This transcends your word choice and includes your tone and body language. This place has their set clientele. They were not to eager to help. Don't worry I wont ever return to support your business.< /review>

Very thankful and blessed to know Jerry. My first time there and he assured me within the hour my 3 pairs of Jean's will be ready. Awesome job Jerry well done. I would recommend everyone to go to Jerry Tailoring.</Review>

I've been going to Jerry's tailoring since 2012. I've never had an issue with their services. If you want the job done right and done in a timely manner then this is the place to go.< /review>

Jerry and his wife are great at what they do. I’m a veteran of the Marines and needed my blues with alterations. To make it harder, I live out of state. So, Jerry has to do measurements before I lost some weight and then a couple of days before my actual wedding! His response time is unmatched. Not only did he have my uniform ready but he did the alterations with preciseness. My blues were satisfactory and got married without having to worry about that. Thank you for the service you provide our members of the military and for mine!<//text>

Honestly the best place.  I refuse to go to Dorothy's and wait 1 week for my items to get cleaned, tailored,  etc.  Probably  the fastest turn around times I've seen with quality to match.  Yes,  an item could possibly  get messed up but that's everywhere you go.  They always replace and re-fix anything not to your liking.  10/10</text>

The absolute best altering business that I have ever been to. The customer service is out of this world and they make you feel like family. They went out of their way to make sure my uniform was absolutely perfect. They got it done the same day when I was expecting it to take a few days. I highly recommend this place to all. Military and civilians alike.< /review>

They are awesome and lovely, husband and wife duo. They have done over 10 jobs for me. Their fast, precise and their prices are the most reasonable you will find in all of Cali. Gonna miss this shop when I PCS. They completely understand the know the regulations for all of the Marine Corps, Navy and Army uniform. No need to look any further than here.  They've also done my civilian suits. And they even have some items for sale at a cheap price.< /Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Super rude and arrogant. Called to ask if they did alterations on a specific garment that some places do not take in, and instead of giving me an answer, he just kept repeating “by when do you need it? What’s your time deadline” I don’t have one, I just want to know if they do the alteration for that specific garment. It was a Yes or No question.

After that, I said I didn’t have a deadline and he says “2 weeks. When are you coming to drop off?” So I ask for the price and he says no pricing over the phone.
Just given me an average price man, I’m going to pay, I just want to know how much!!

Not recommending this place to anyone on base. They don’t deserve business with that attitude.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I'm a USMC service member and been goin here for a couple years now. Its run by a sweet hispanic couple who truly know their ranks and regulations. Always willing to stay a little later for you and work things out, definitely go here before resorting to Dorothy's 💯</review>

After reading so many good reviews, we were very excited to work with Jerry's.  However... we were only disappointed with the service we received.

My wife took her dress in to get it altered prior to a military ball.  When we went to pick up (on the date we were told to), they could not find the dress.  When they found it, the alterations were not complete.  Because of this, she had to scramble to find a dress to wear to the ball!

When my wife went back (over a month later...Why hurry when they already failed to meet their promised timeline?), the dress still did not fit her well and the beading had been damaged.  On top of that, Jerry would not accept the fact that the dress was poorly altered to fit her.  I called the shop later, and Jerry was equally as rude to me.

Jerry's may be decent with uniforms, but there are too many great tailors in the area to risk wasting your money on dress alterations here.  I now have to pay someone else to do the job that Jerry's promised they could do initially.< /review>

This place does REALLY good, FAST, work for extremely competitive prices, but they never open on time (they open about 45 mins past the posted time that they say they will).  So, if you want to utilize their services (which I honestly HIGHLY recommend) be prepared for that.   This place is solely owned and operated by an older married couple, but they are, legit, amazing.< /text>

Dropped off metals to get one mounted. Showed up to pick them up and one of the stars was mounted low and crooked. They asked to come back the next day. Next day I show up and they forgot. They asked to come back the following day. They simply peeled off the star and remounted it slightly above the incorrect location but didn't bother to remove the glue. To add insult to injury my metals are scratched up and when I asked why I was told "those are yours we didn't touch them"

I won't be returning here and I wildly urge others not to come here unless you want long turnaround times, high prices, and damaged uniform items. Thanks but no thanks.<//Text>

I am a loyal customer. These are such hardworking, honest, and reliable people. They work very quickly and around the clock to get things done in a timely manner. Most of the time whatever I bring them is done before they say they can have it done. Will always come here :)</Review>

The reason I’m giving one star is because of price. They are very expensive and before anyone says anything I took my chucks in for alterations and paid twice as much as my friend that did literally the same thing! Decided to give another try and bought medals for the ball they costed me $68 I’m not joking I could show the receipt mind you it was three medals and they VERY DIRTY my friend again goes there and gets two medals and paid $6 like how!? They only accept cash but have an ATM inside. MAKE SURE TO KEEP YOUR RECEIPT! They are nice but it’s most definitely the last time I will go there and I would not recommend anyone to go there!</Review>

HE WAS VERY RUDE, did not acknowledge me until a few minutes later. he wasn’t very helpful at all. He didn’t like the fact that I asked him about not paying until pick up (which is normal). His response to my question was “do you want it or not”. Obviously it was no & I went to Kings-men Cleaners and was charged almost 25 dollars LESS! my first and LAST time going there.</review>

This is the best pizza place in Anaheim. If you are in the Anaheim Stanton area you are in their delivery range.
Their pizza is a far better quality than pizza hut and leagues above little Caesars. Their chicken is also amazing. I can't recommend this Pizzeria enough. Weather you go there to sit down and eat or have it delivered it's great either way.</Review>

<Review>I ordered wings for the 1st time.I asked for hot wings.  Paid $1 per wing and was very very disappointed.
The wings were so small and dry.
I ended up making my own sauce.
Next time I'm better off just making my own.
Do Not order wings from this place they are the smallest and way overpriced.
Small frozen wings and flavorless
The 1st pic is what they delivered
2nd pic is after I added my own sauce</Review>< response>

<text>Found our go-to pizza place in our new neighborhood! It's a quaint spot and the owner is a sweet Nepalese lady. My husband and I love this place, because it's a simple pizza spot with all the pizza necessities. The first time we came, we got pizza sandwiches! Sounds strange right? It's literally a pizza sandwich - kind of like a sub, with whatever 2 toppings you'd like. The second time, I got a calzone (which is HUGE btw)! It's not on their menu, but you can still order it. It's around $7. Pizza slices are $1.50 and they usually have specials for an extra large 16" pizza for $12.49.

The guys who work there and do the deliveries are nice, and chatting with the owner always makes my day. Again, we love this place!</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNezhBTKvJ4wVtYCgDp2K2mI9x_7dP7jPLwM3N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Great if you want a meal in your hotel room. On a Disneyland vacation and looked this place up on Yelp. Review were right on, we got the family meal (one topping pizza with spaghetti or lasagna) for 18.99. Loved the spaghetti, it came with four pieces or garlic bread. Ordered a pepperoni pizza, a garden salad, and a 2 liter of 7up. They provided plates, forks, napkins, and cups. Short drive down Ball Road and they deliver also. Small for dining in about 5 tables. Staff was very nice.</Review>

I guess we're missing something, but the pizza was just ok. Nothing special. The cheesy bread was a sub roll with a piece of mozzarella cheese on it, and I didn't even eat the meatballs cause they smelled weird. Two stars only because the lady working seemed very nice.< /Text>

< Review>
Pizza was kinda weird... not enough cheese and the sauce was over powering. We asked for extra crispy wings and they were soggy and gross. Beware - the website with their name is not theirs! I guess someone is messing with them and keeping it up which i'm sure gives them a lot of problems. I was surprised by this and the guy even offered to cancel my whole order... which i didn't because he was so nice but i wish i did because i just did not enjoy it. This place has great reviews though so maybe it's just not my kind of pizza! ;)</Review>

I went at 4pm on a weekday, your mileage may vary.

The coin machines were easy to find and were all working.

The vending machines had detergent for $0.75.

They have multiple sizes of washing machines starting at $1.25/load. The equipment all worked.

The place has WiFi (password written on the register up front) so I got some work done while waiting. Not bad overall.</Text>

Received the worst customer service I've ever had in my entire life here. After one of the washing machines finished, I tried to open the door, but some kind of error code came up on its display, and wouldn't open. I told one of the associates about it, and she blamed it on me saying it was because I tried to open it before the cycle finished. She then left to grab some tools, but very loudly and obviously huffed and puffed saying "WHY OH WHY" so that everyone nearby could hear.

She came back to the machine with a screw driver, with no luck, and I explained to her that she can check her cameras to see if I tried to open the door before the cycle finished. She still gave me attitude afterwards, and went to her cashier desk to call her family (I think) to ask for some extra tools. She got frustrated and actually yelled into the phone, with what I think were Spaniah expletives - again, so that everyone can hear and try and make me feel bad.

Afterward, I checked one of the other machines I used, and I saw that that door was locked, too. I told her about that, and she loudly said "I WONDER WHY". We walked back to the first machine that had problems, and I told her I did not appreciate her attitude toward me in front of all the customers. From there on she kept yelling, but at that point I just ignored her ignorant self and stopped paying attention to what she was saying.

I'd like to believe this was racially motivated, but I won't say for certain. All I know is that I was the only Asian customer there, and after our argument, she started talking to the other Latinos standing nearby in Spanish, very obviously about me.

Incredibly rude, and overall trashy behavior. Even if I did make the mistake of trying to open the doors before the cycle finished (who would even do that anyway?), the associate's response was way out of line. I will never be a customer at this place again.<//Text>

However, there is no A/C, making it extremely hot, especially during the winter. Depending on the time of day, you can have many machines open and many that are taken. The worst days is when half of the machines or out of outdoor. The staff are a hit and miss, some are nice and some are rude. Bathrooms have no soap and paper towels. After the reopening, they advertised that they had wifi, now they don't, I mean it was already faulty from the start! Not many tables to fold clothes on. So lately, we have been taking our clothes home to fold, due to heat and no table space. Parking is shared with the other stores, and the spaces are really small.</text>< Pics>

Every time I come into this location the money changers are out of order and the cashier will not give change. The old owner would all that. I had to walk to another business to get change to wash my clothes this is POOR customer service. There are two bill changers with two on each and one is completely out of service, one bill to bill changer and that is out of order all the time. The people who work here are all Hispanic and seem to have a problem servicing black persons, their body language and demeanor is bad.<//review>

<review>Long story short: It’s the kind of place that charges you 1.50$ to use an out-of-order bathroom.

They had signs saying if you put 20$ on a laundry card, you’d get a free 5$. I figured it was worth it, since the place is clean and the machines are nice. Nope! The manager pretended he couldn’t understand me when I asked how the laundry card machine worked. He watched me insert a 20$ bill, then said the cost of getting a card was 1$. Which meant now I only had 19$, and could not get the promotion. I said okay, and entered a 1$ bill. He shook his head, rolled his eyes, and explained it only works with a 20$ bill. So I would have had to put *another* 20$ onto the card. I asked why he didn’t tell me that before I put in the first 20$, and he just walked away while I was speaking. What a swindler! He knew exactly what he was doing.  I will not be returning.

Also, the prices were quite high! It’s 3$ for a single, small load, but that’s with cold water and the smallest possible wash time. If you want warm water, it brings it up to 3.50$. Want a delicate cycle? Another 50 cents. Want to use the disgusting bathroom? Another 50 cents, but only if you have a card.

Definitely would not recommend.< /review><userid>105554757425745464298</userid><Pics>None</Pics>< user_name>

<Review>As soon as I walked in I was greeted by an associate who worked there, which is the fastest I've ever been greeted at any uniform store. *Cough cough*. I will continue to do business with Cal uniforms as they are well-equipped for any item that I need and if it is not in store it can be ordered for me without hassle. I'll be coming back. FOR SURE.</Review><Resp>{'time': 1555206403218, 'text': 'Thank you so much for such a nice review. We appreciate every customer, but especially those who appreciate us. Thank you again!

Great customer service! I went in to pick up a uniform I recently purchased and brought in some chevrons to get sewn on, due to a recent promotion. I fully expected the chevrons to be sewn on at a later time. They put them on while I waited and were so friendly to my daughter and I. I will certainly be a return customer. Thank you guys for the old school customer service.<//text>

<Text>I almost never give out five stars but this place is all about the best customer service plenty of parking and carts.they have tables to sit .They have a couple of massage chairs.hot and cold drinks Vending machines with snacks and others sell laundry soaps fabric softener.Big screen Televisions and big screen security camera views so you can check on your car in the parking lot as well as all the isles in the laundromat.Oh and they have change machines no need for troublesome apps to turn machines on. Did I mention that they are open 24hrs and they have an attendant present at all times ready to meet your needs. The place is clean.Best of all the machines actually work. my cloths have never turned out so bright fresh and clean and dry..I was in and out in a couple of hrs. Did about 50 loads dried and folded. Pretty much had the place to myself.It was awesome. Oh oh.they also sell purified drinking water just outside the door.So bring your five gallon containers and refill while your at it.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>I want to thank the dry cleaning shop for the great service. I had a suit dry cleaned here, and it looked great. I brought some silk shirts with some spots that needed some extra cleaning, and they repeated them and brought them back to life. 5 stars all the way! Keep up the good work!<//review></record>

Some washing machines either:
-they dont work at all
-dont rinse
-dont prewash
-dont spin cycle
-cant "use too much soap"

The change dispenser machines are out of use, so you have to wait until the employee helps you (he's doing his best so is not hia fault)

-the drying machines only give you 12 mins per quarter(most places give 15 min) so thats another star less

- verdict: if you try harder you'll find a better place than this.< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>As a veteran on all these local laundromats, this one here, is the best. First you will find at least 4 washers available at all times, it helps they have a wide variety of sizes. Huge open lay out, super clean, with dryers to spare, of course visiting after 6 is recommended. Just keep an eye on your cart those can roll away somehow.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

This place is disgusting!!! I only came here bc I needed to wash my bedding and didn't want to wash big loads at home. Now I feel I need to wash it all over again somewhere else. This place is gross. It smells. The washers are old and squeak when they're going through the cycles. But the worst really is the smell. Go anywhere else. Trust.< /text>

< Review>
I always hate having to do laundry. Especially when the laundromat is crazy packed...I live down the street from a 24hour laundromat with free dry during late night...but honestly. I dont mind driving like 7 mins to come to this location. Its ways clean..and all the machines work at all times. And the dryer's actually dry majority of my clothes with only 2 quarters per machine! I'm glad I pushed myself to go check this place out...I feel comfortable there. And I love that theres a LIVE stat on how busy it is... :D</Review>

<UserId.>103747295222410189697< /UserId.><Review>It's okay here. It's very clean and not very crowded. My biggest concern is the fact that the large washer never finished a final spin, and left my bedding soaked. The 'self adjusting timer' seemed to think that it was okay to reduce from 7 minutes down to 1, and yep - left everything thoroughly drenched, not to mention heavy. That isn't how things are supposed to come out.

Now waiting longer and paying extra for a dryer that probably won't work. Ugh<//Review><username>Erin Lani</username><rate>3< /rate><resp>None<//resp><date>1430698709466<//date></record>

Change machine out of order, but no sign to let anyone know. It Costa a quarter to use the resroom, but no seat covers, no hand towels or soap to wash your hands. Not enough laundry carts and the place is not full. This place use to be very nice. So sad. But, I need clean clothes.< /Review>

< Review>
This is a for sure spot that offers great service, clean machines, nice sized bathroom if your alone and want to bring your stuff in with you. I went on a Saturday morning around 8ish. There were carts available. If not, someone that worked there helped me find one and asked patrons with multiple carts if they were planning on using all of them. I ended up with a cart. Got breakfast across the street at this super neighborly spot called Christy's donuts. I am temporarily staying in DTLA for a few months and in this area there only Laundry Services/ Dry cleaning. I tried walking around to Broadway and Olympic laundromat or S&H laundromat or Lucy's and it's either non existent or you can't get there without a car which I don't have with me right now. Plus where I live charges $3 per panty to wash. Insane!!! Plus they turned my black coat brown >:-[  I was able to wash my all my clothes here comfortably in a safe neighborhood. The walk from the train is painful but so worth the clean clothes :-). This spot I highly recommend. Also they do have a small parking lot if you do drive.< /Review>

<text>I just wanted my clothes to be dry, the machine did not work, she directed me to the attendant and she told me there was nothing I could do about it because I had not put Downey on the clothes that Suavitel has to see with clothes that did not dry She was totally soaked, she was aggressive with me, I am a pregnant woman and she was rude.</text>< user_name>

Very quick turn around for design and quote. I went in to give them my measurements on Wednesday and they had a quote for me ready by Thursday morning.
Unfortunately we were not able to purchase our cabinets here but they were quick and accommodating in making plans for us.</review>

Ice white shaker doors cracked after 3months of installed, replaced it 2times already, no one there has any answer and always short materials<//Review>
<pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1623465719551, 'text': "Hello Van!\n\nWe're really sorry that you have to experience this. Ice White Shaker is made of natural material, therefore the wood will move based on the rooms relative humidity or moisture in the air. The cracking is most likely the result of restricting the wood movement because of the screws from the hinges and door handles as it shrinks. We try to lower the chances of this happening by through properly kiln drying our cabinet doors.\n\nWe would be happy to replace the crack doors as part of your warranty. Please email us at info@greencastlecabinetry.com, so one of our sales rep can assist you with the replacement process.\n\nWe apologize again and hope to see you at the store so we can help fix the problem.\n\nThanks!\nGreencastle"}</Resp>< GmapID>

What I like about Greencastle Cabinetry are the people. The sales are not pushy and the managers are very nice. They will try to resolve any issues to satisfy the customer and really want to offer the best price possible even if it mean making only cents. The warehouse personnel are fantastic. They are very helpful and fast!<//review>

Great service and quality cabinets (plywood) at a great price.

They took our plans and did a drawing and rendering so we could see exactly what we were getting. The cabinets are all boxed and you have to put them together, watch the videos on their website for instructions.

We had a cabinet with a crack in the frame, they let us exchange it without issue. Great service and would definitely recommend.</review>

<text>We have been working with Greencastle for a few weeks now. We are very happy with the build quality [all plywood] and the operation of the hinges, slides etc. We have not been let down with quotes, stock issues or any of the normal business glitches. We searched for 5 years to find this service and will continue to do business with them. Special shout out to Larry, Marco and the lady at the cash register also the warehouse staff and the lady in the warehouse are extremely helpful.</text>< pictures>

A-ONE SERVICE, TOP QUALITY PRODUCT & BEST PRICED CABINETRY YOU'LL FIND HANDS DOWN!!!

Ask for Simmon!!

After we made our choices, Simmon laid out a few packages with computer-generated blueprints of our space & offered very knowledgeable suggestions & recommendations.

Changing your Cabinets/ Remodeling your Kitchen isn't an easy task. I was Doubtful, spectacle and fearful of the outcome and how it wouldnt turn out the way we wanted. WELL Greencastle Cabinetry MADE IT HAPPEN, our expectation far exceeded what we initially thought. Save your time, go in and ask for Simmon I assure you will have no regrets.</Review>

Very quick turn around for design and quote. I went in to give them my measurements on Wednesday and they had a quote for me ready by Thursday morning.
Unfortunately we were not able to purchase our cabinets here but they were quick and accommodating in making plans for us.</text>

Ice White Shaker is made of natural material, therefore the wood will move based on the rooms relative humidity or moisture in the air. The cracking is most likely the result of restricting the wood movement because of the screws from the hinges and door handles as it shrinks. We try to lower the chances of this happening by through properly kiln drying our cabinet doors.\n\nWe would be happy to replace the crack doors as part of your warranty. Please email us at info@greencastlecabinetry.com, so one of our sales rep can assist you with the replacement process.\n\nWe apologize again and hope to see you at the store so we can help fix the problem.\n\nThanks!\nGreencastle"}< /response>< GmapID>

They took our plans and did a drawing and rendering so we could see exactly what we were getting. The cabinets are all boxed and you have to put them together, watch the videos on their website for instructions.

We had a cabinet with a crack in the frame, they let us exchange it without issue. Great service and would definitely recommend.< /Review>< pictures>

We have been working with Greencastle for a few weeks now. We are very happy with the build quality [all plywood] and the operation of the hinges, slides etc. We have not been let down with quotes, stock issues or any of the normal business glitches. We searched for 5 years to find this service and will continue to do business with them. Special shout out to Larry, Marco and the lady at the cash register also the warehouse staff and the lady in the warehouse are extremely helpful.</Text>

A-ONE SERVICE, TOP QUALITY PRODUCT & BEST PRICED CABINETRY YOU'LL FIND HANDS DOWN!!!

Ask for Simmon!!

After we made our choices, Simmon laid out a few packages with computer-generated blueprints of our space & offered very knowledgeable suggestions & recommendations.

Changing your Cabinets/ Remodeling your Kitchen isn't an easy task. I was Doubtful, spectacle and fearful of the outcome and how it wouldnt turn out the way we wanted. WELL Greencastle Cabinetry MADE IT HAPPEN, our expectation far exceeded what we initially thought. Save your time, go in and ask for Simmon I assure you will have no regrets.<//text>

James Harrington was fantastic to work with, always proactively kept us up to date, and was even willing to talk after normal business hours to help us move quickly through the underwriting process. Thanks to James, we were able to go from accepted offer to appraisal to keys-in-hand in about 23 days which is pretty amazing. Thank you!<//Text>< Pictures>

Our experience with Felicia was simply fantastic. We found her contact through one of my best Friend, Felicia and her team provided most fast response and professional service; Felicia is very easy to work with highly skilled, I really appreciate for her hard work and immediate response on my pre approval letter at 10PM Sunday weekend on short notice. I'd highly recommend her mortgage financing.<//text>

It was a pleasure working with Linda on refinancing my home. She kept me well informed throughout the process and was always super quick to respond to any questions I had. If I ever buy or refinance I would choose Linda and would certainly recommend her to my friends and colleagues. Thank you Linda for all you do!< /text>

This is our third time our family has had our loan done through James.  He is a wonderful agent and very pleasant to work with. He provided excellent services. Our case was a little bit tacky, however he went above and beyond to secure the loan for us. He is extremely trustworthy, very professional and knowledgable in the mortgage loan field. I had great communication from him through the whole process. I am very grateful to have had James as our loan officer and I am super happy with our new home. I highly recommend his services to everyone.</Text>

From the very first contact to the Close of Title, Felicia was there with help or an answer to any question. At every milestone she made sure everything was understood and explained the next item we would be working on. Her professionalism was appreciated by all parties involved in our transaction. We could not have had a smoother purchase. Thank you so much Felicia!</Review>

< Review>
Visited for the first time with friends. The food and service were excellent. Heat lamps kept me warm. I will definitely go back.
Try it. You'll like it, too. I particularly enjoyed the lamb casserole. It was melt-in-your-mouth tender.< /Review>

First time dining indoors since covid-19 started and it was the best choice. Excellent service and delicious food. The Chef was on point with the tastes from beginning to end -- from the eggplant parmigiana to the pesto to our fish to the tiramisu. He was a gracious caring host, and I will definitely return and turn other friends on to this gem in Brentwood.< /Text>

The staff is friendly, the ecosystem is first-class and the meals are delicious, this neighborhood really enjoyed it rained when we went or might have liked to eat outside on the patio again.<//review>

Perfect ambient for couples,people who like  to talk to each other,people who are interested in having an amazing time in a cozy restaurant with a great service and delicious dishes! The fish is extraordinary!!! I’ve tried the branzino and another recommendation from the chef. Unique! We also had the vegetarian meatballs,simply delicious! The service is impeccable,the food is DELICIOUS and overall an amazing experience there. I definitely recommend it and dare to try whatever they suggest on and off the menu! Thank you guys!

The restaurant is way too expensive for what it offers. The food isn't bad, but the service is. Restaurant employees work at the table next to you on their computers as you dine. The management is impolite and self important. Stick with Parmesan!</review>

I never thought I would go out of my way to write a negative review about a restaurant, but I feel that my experience at this place has to be written about somewhere. I did visit for my first time here on Valentine's Day, so given the hectic nature of this "holiday" at restaurants, perhaps I just chose the wrong first day. Anyway, the dinner for two included an appetizer, main meal and dessert, all bundled up to $60 per person. This was more than I have ever paid at a dinner for two at even more "luxurious" locations in LA, but given the date, I still attended expecting to be blown away.
The Appetizer: A small plate with cured beef surrounding a thin salad. The beef was thin yet flavorful, but unknowingly ordering a new type of food with a strange name resulted in being intimidated by uncooked beef, so I didn't really enjoy it too much. Given it was my fault, I continued onto the main dish.
The Main Meal: I don't think I have ever tasted a more dry, flavorless chicken at a restaurant. The flavor matched the kind I make at home on a George Foreman grill when I'm in a hurry. Given that this was to be the main meal of the evening, the portion size was a terrible disappointment as well. It was simply a breaded piece of chicken breast coated with yet another thin layer of salad and a couple of tomato pieces scattered throughout the dish. No sides or anything, just plain chicken and uncomfortably thin greenery.
Dessert: Best part of meal, 3 scoops of assorted sorbet in a small plate.
The $4 tea I was served only lasted me 1 small ~6 oz. cup, since it was removed after the appetizer and never returned after that. The tea was nothing extraordinary, only a selection of assorted tea bags one could find at a Rite Aid or CVS. The Valet gentleman tipped over my girlfriend's roses when retrieving the car, and spilled water all over her laptop bag. Given the poor service, overcrowded environment and small portions of food for such a high price, I decided not to leave a tip, as I was on somewhat of a budget. Now, I have always been a courteous tipper, leaving the average amount and often more when service is great, but this time I just couldn't bring myself around to do it. Regardless, the restaurant decided to charge the 18% gratuity fee onto my card although I specifically signed a different total on the receipt. I was notified that my checking account was over-drafted this morning by a couple of bucks because of this. I guess I learned my lesson, dinner on Valentine's Day is the worst idea ever. I will attempt to call and get the money refunded, given that as far as I was concerned, a gratuity fee was not mandatory, especially for only a party of two.</Review>

<review>UPDATE - Fantastic as always! Chef/Owner Raffaele and Erin are great and are now remembering me!!! :-) They have my all-time favorite dish...Cacio e Pepe! After Roma, Italia, only the namesake in NYC and Pecorino do it almost just as well! If I'm within 90 minutes of Pecorino, I go! BTW...everything else on the menu is also delicious! ENJOY! Ci vediamo presto! CIAO for Now!

Great dinner with all my traditional favorites, served by an Italian staff! Prosciutto e Melone - the melon could have a little more ripe; however, the Prosciutto was fantastic. I went for my all time favorite - Cacio e Pepe - and it did not disappoint. Finished in the wheel of Pecorino!The freshly made sfogliatelle were outstanding!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1583623223098, 'text': 'Marco!

wonderful- service- food & atmosphere
Though I do miss Mario who was always at the front- a welcoming presence
Luckily his brother is still part owner and chef- so quality is still superb< /Review>

Don't even know where to start. The rockstars at Solution21 are incredible! To put it simply. I needed assistance getting the website for my dental practice off the ground. Being that I am about as tech-savvy as a 4 year old, there was a lot of work to be done. Oscar reassured me that everything would be fine and Solution21 could handle the build. Sahil took charge of the project and kept me informed through the whole process. They completed the build in about a month and provided the required training. I will be using them in the future for all of my web/marketing needs.

***Farid, Oscar, Ray, Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping keep this project moving forward.

Solution21 has one of the best medical and dental web development & marketing teams in the nation. I have been involved in web marketing since 2001 and worked with many teams in different industries. I have worked for Solution21 for two years, directing their paid search department. I can tell you that they are honest and to the point. They take care of their clients as well as they take care of their own employees. A good thing about them is that the entire team actually work from their office in Irvine, California. As a result, their clients can easily communicate with them to get the job done faster and with much better quality. If you are thinking to build a new website for your practice or get more patient leads, just call them up and listen to their story. You will not be disappointed.  As a consultant to many doctors and health-care providers, I highly recommend Solution21.< /text>

I can't speak highly enough about Solution21. I have been using them for years. They did such a great job on designing our website. It is always a pleasure working with them throughout the whole process as they addressed any and all concerns so fast and efficiently.

Solution 21 has provided a well coded and professional looking platform for our online marketing efforts. The Wordpress platform is flexible and intuitive allowing us to access our HTML in order to keep the information current and to introduce new ways to capture the interest of prospective clients.

Business to business communication has smooth and hassle-free. After publishing the initial platform subsequent requests to make changes to our site have been executed promptly.

We would recommend this web design service with the caveat that it will still be necessary to continue to take the initiate to differentiate one's services from others. Solution 21 can provide the platform, but a business owner must still provide their own unique voice.< /Review>

Incredibly disappointing and  misleading.  This company advertised themselves as, and claimed to be specific to dental offices.  I had been a customer for years while they hosted our dental practice's website, with little no improvement, EVER, on google's rankings.  I finally made the decision to see what other companies offer and I was told by multiple website hosts that not only were they not keeping our content current enough for google to rank us decently, but they did not include much of any of the specific coding and words required for google to recognize us as relevant or even a dental practice in most searches.  Couple this with the AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE, and you couldn't make a worse decision.  My email address was hacked, I had to beg and call and send email after email with call and call to get anyone at Solution 21 to make the necessary corrections for my emails not to be blocked by other servers.  Even after months of me asking and following up they had still never taken the necessary actions and I went months unable to use my company email. Not to mention, anytime I wanted to make a change to my website they wanted to charge me.  Do yourself a favor and look around- there are companies that actually keep your content current, review your status monthly, monitor your listings, and keep you relevant as a PART of their services.  Don't settle for terrible service with fees for content updates that they should be handling for you in the first place.</Text>

We got many complements from our clients after Solution 21 Launched our new website. This was one of those investments that got an immediate return as our site is bringing in so much work for us . We have grown our business with a very professional and affordable new website and marketing package. Their customer service is outstanding. &  far exceed my expectation.

Solution21 made us an awesome website about 2 years ago that we have been very happy with.  We like to make frequent changes that sometimes we complete, but if out of the realm of our experience, they are quick to complete for us.  We have found many patients comment on the clean look and ease of navigation of our website.  I would recommend Solution21 without any hesitation if you are looking for a company to design a website. ~ Office Manager Dr. Kathleen Mullaney</Text>

I have used Solution 21 for a couple of years now and I can tell you without any reservation that they are the best website management company I have dealt with in my 34 years in practice. The have done what they said they would do as far as keeping me on page 1 of Google and keeping my content fresh and using keywords for the Chiropractic Profession that matter and get you found online. I have referred a few colleagues to them already and they respond to my request in quickly and efficiently. I recommend that you use them if you want online business and are serious about your website.Just Google, "Best Chiropractor in Houston" and you'll see what they have done for me.

I have tried many marketing companies in the past to promote my dental office.  Most of them were filled with empty promises.  Solution 21 simply delivers with great performance and results rather than make empty promises.  They built me an awesome custom made website and optimized my site for major search engines.  The return on investments from Solution 21 is priceless.  Their fees are very reasonable compared to other marketing companies.  They have ongoing support with fast responses to any issues.  I highly recommend this company to all my colleagues.<//review>

<review>I have been a client of solution 21 since 2008. For five years I used their web.site services and been very happy with overall customer service. Last year I expanded my services with them and started utilizing their new products. I have been very pleased with their level of professionalism and care. Their expanded services has made it very convenient to have a complete online marketing service which works.< /review>< pictures>

<text>We have been using Solution21 since 2009. They have a great support team that takes care of our daily site maintenance. They built our website and have been in charge of our digital marketing as well. Beside SEO and PPC and Social Media marketing, we like their email marketing service.

It's a parking lot full of Uber drivers taking 2-3 parking spaces while they wait. There isn't much there... It's paved.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Stop here and go to Agora to enjoy Brazilian cuisine. The first thing you should think of is "Churrascaria Brazilian kiln grilling?"
Agora Churrascaria has a magnificent appearance made of river stone and wood. When you walk into the restaurant, the high patio allows the sunlight to reach the interior, making the rustic stone walls look warm. The neutral tones of brown and white make you feel very comfortable.
ㄧ A very unique, interesting, and full meal. When you come here, you will definitely let you think and get better than you expect! Great meal at least once!
I accidentally discovered a Japanese restaurant "Makino" diagonally across the street. My favorite food is Japanese food. Come back next time!

(Original)
到這兒停車，去Agora享用巴西料理，大家最先想到的應該就是 「Churrascaria 巴西窯烤」了吧?!
Agora Churrascaria 有著河石與木頭建構的壯闊外觀，走進餐廳，高聳的天井讓陽光照近室內，讓質樸的石頭牆面顯得溫暖，棕色、白色系的中性色調令人感覺非常舒適。
ㄧ個很獨特的、有趣的、吃的很飽的一頓大餐，來到這裡，絕對讓您所想的、得到的，要比您所預料的好！很棒的一餐至少要經歷一次！
無意間發現了斜對面有家日本料理餐廳「Makino 」，最喜愛吃日本料理food，下回再來吃囉！<//Text>< pics>

Rubi is awesome. She helped me from the start of looking and finding a particular vehicle that I wanted for my daughter and I. She then kept in touch everyday until the deal was made and paper work was all complete . I got the best deal ever and the vehicle I wanted in a week.. Rubi is very kind and knowledgeable. It was fun at the same time. She made sure I was not stressed in the whole process . Thank you Rubi and quantum for your business . This is my 2nd vehicle I purchase at this exact place .<//text>

I highly recommend this dealership. I went to Quantum to look at a Cadillac I saw on their website. The car was at their Anaheim location so Mike had one of his guys drive to Anaheim and bring the Caddy back for me to test drive. It looked and drove great. Mike didn't pressure me or use typical sales tactics. He was easy to work with and gave me a great deal on the Caddy.</review>

<Text>Don't bother going here, #1, i put a deposit on a car, they told me they would put it aside and they put it back in the sales lot and reposted it for sale at a higher price right after i left, then even with them knowing for several days that i was coming in early on saturday morning to pick it up, they weren't prepared at all, spent 2 hours sitting there doing nothing, and then when i went to sign the paperwork the price of the car was no longer the price that it was when i had put the deposit on it, and they were going to try and charge me an extra 7 grand, so i asked for my money back, 2 weeks later and they still have my 6900 dollars, because for some reason they didn't process the refund till yesterday, horrible experience, won't recommend,overpriced and horrible service.</Text><user>103979777694851104028<//user><Name>Patrick Conely</Name></record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>THE most irresponsible dealer I have ever been to. I got their asked them whether they would like to buy my car, and they told me to stand by the counter and wait. They literally just left me standing there for almost half an hour. After someone finally gave me a quote, they offered me half of the prices that other dealer provided. What a total waste of time.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Alex went out of his way to go get me and to make sure I got the vehicle I wanted and he gave me a good deal with a great down payment. I've been talking with him for over 3 weeks and he kept his word everything he told me from the start . I am very satisfied and extremely happy with the service I received and extremely happy with the car I got. I will be referring him to everyone I know that is looking for a vehicle. Thank you very much!! 💯💯💯< /review>

I was pretty disappointed since I drove 2 hours round trip for nothing. I thought my credit had already been run since I received a preapproval online last night. Instead when I got there, they hadn't run my credit, required 25% down and wouldn't split the down payment even with my trade in. I just wish they would have been up front with me because it would have been better for us both instead of wasting time and my gas to drive for an hour each way. I gave 2 stars because the guy was nice and pleasant although it still wasted my day for this trip when it could have all been done online ahead of time like I thought that it was.< /text>

Hands down, best service, best price, and beyond satisfied. We arrived and were quickly greeted. We had the pleasure of having Tony help us look for the perfect car. We were able to find one, Tony let us take the vehicle for a spin. I’m a firm believer in having the process be very smooth if it is meant to happen. At no point in time did we ever feel any type of pressure or attitude of any sort. Coming up with a price that we both agreed with was fast and simple. We are beyond grateful for Tony and Eddie that helped us out with a great price and rate. If you are looking for great customer service, I suggest you go to Quantum Auto Sales!<//review>

While looking for my next car I was recommended to Quantum Auto Sales, I just didn’t know I was gonna received the service I did. The minute I walked onto he parking lot there was someone greeting me with a smile. Tony was an exceptional individual. Never a pushy sales man.  He showed me the different type of model vehicles that I was looking for and was happy to let me test drive them all, if need be. I fell in love with one in particular and he said, let’s make it happen. Eddie and Tony worked with me from beginning to end. I left feeling appreciated as a customer and also happy with the car of my choice.  If you are looking for that right car, I would highly recommended visiting this dealership. I’m forever grateful for the wonderful customer service provided to my family and I and giving me a great deal! Thank you!</Text>

<username>stephanie malatin< /username><rating>1<//rating><Time>1583200114006</Time><pictures>None</pictures><review>Yeah ok it's a horrible review. Let's start off with saying the car salesman Carlos talk to me in over the phone and via text. Pretty much got me a done deal he says. I explained everything to him a situation and it's in that he got me financed with the second chance lender great. Before I drive all the way down to Escondido I called him texting to make sure it is a done deal. He says it is a done deal and that I would get gas in the car and the drive would be worth my while. Done deal right I drive down there the done deal is yeah we got you approved for the second chance lender but your car payments $500 that's what I'm told when I get down there or did I get upset and go off. He also did not tell me he was off that day knowing I was going down there. So I put a review on here that day was not a good one. Finance guy says to Carlos I really want to work with Stephanie but she really needs to take that review off cuz it makes us look bad. If she takes it off will work with her so I did the only working they did with me is talking to me over the phone. I haven't got me a deal yet. So now I'm reposting the review they suck there.And when they see this one might get a call from Carlos or a text saying hey what's up I'm working on it I don't care I will tell them too bad I'm not taking it down.<//review></record>

I wanted to give a special thanks to Ruby and the team at Quantum Auto Sales. I live about 30 minutes south of Escondido and after doing my research and speaking to Ruby over the phone I decided to go up there and check out what they had to offer. This is not my first car buying experience but was definitely the BEST service and pricing I've received.  The staff there were professional, informative to all my questions and most of all had well rounded knowledge of their vehicles on the lot. I Definitely appreciate all of their car buying service and will be referring friends and family to Quantum Auto</Review>

Upon arrival I noticed Eric a salesman of Quantum was the first on scene, so he greeted us and offered help with anything based on our visit. Eric both english and spanish was able to assist on finding a vehicle due to my credit score. He walked us through a few cars that met my standard and the next day I visited Quantum again and specifically looked for Eric due to his effort of helping me getting into a vehicle. Overall, i am now a vehicle owner thanks to the help of Eric and Quantum Auto Sales</Text>

< Review>
I have bought quite a few cars in my life and I have never ever received such professional and excellent follow through service in my life. I was picked up from the train station and treated with the up most respect, Mike and Edward did exactly what they promised. They put me in the car I wanted within an Hr. Even with challenging credit. I will be buying all my cars from Quantum Auto Sales on the future and I recommend anyone that wants a quality car to go to Quantum. Excellent...

Anaheim location: I went to have some of the things done that where on the Due bill. I once again received excellent service. Raul gave me excellent service and made me feel valuable as a customer. He took the time to inform me of all the details to the work they performed.  Once again. Great. I will recommend all my friends to buy cars from Quantum Auto Sales.<//Review>

<username>Russ Wood</username><Date>1515006276313</Date><rating>5< /rating><Review>I am pleased to offer a review to record my experience with Quantum Auto not only for Aaron with securing a loan for the purchase my Jeep Cherokee, but more specifically with Freddy the repair manager.

I was very pleased and surprised that Aaron was able to secure a loan for me. It was effortless and he did a great job and keeping me informed of the process my next car purchase I hope to work with Aaron again in the future.

There where a few minor cosmetic issues with the vehicle and I work with Freddy the repair manager. Freddy took care of them right away even though I was slightly over the mileage cap. We had a great conversation I felt really comfortable with him and he did what he promised to make sure I was satisfied. I am very pleased to be able to know andwork with Aaron and Freddy. And I am grateful for the experience.

I certainly recommend Quantum Auto Sales. They provide very personal attention and they strive to make sure their customers are satisfied.

Respectfully,

Russel W.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>I went in to Quantum not really sure what I wanted. I met Tony there and he was the most informative and helpful person I have met while shopping for a new car. I ended up buying a mustang and could not be happier with the entire experience! I recommend anyone to come here if they are looking for a new car!<//Review>< Pictures>

I, Francisco Llamas am thankful for Alex's help on financing me a vehicle. Im super happy and excited to be driving a new car. Alex was very kind, considerate, and knowledgeable. He made the whole experience a great one for me. I give him the most stars possible, definitely a good sales rep to say the least. Sincerely, Francisco Llamas.<//Review>

Overall, my experience with the Quantum Auto was very positive. Typically when you carshop around dealerships the sales people come at you like sharks, not this time. I talked to a Perla who was very welcoming. Perla was really helpful in getting me a general quote and explaining my options to purchase.  it was a shame I had to be on the fence and was only shopping around. If you're shopping around or simply have questions I have no doubt this place is great. I definitely recommend speaking with Perla.< /Review>

Leaving a 5 star review for Mike @ Quantum.
He made the impossible...possible! I have Cash income and poor credit...and he was able to get us financed no problem. He even took the time to shop around and get us a much lower APR. He was always easy to get a hold of and great communication! Just wanted to say thank you!!<//review>

Wow. I love the place Tony and Alex was great. When I called Alex about the car I wanted he told me to come on down and we would make a deal, and wow we walked out of there with no Hassel with a brand new car of our dreams. Tony the lion was friendly and down to earth as well as everyone there.The store manager was great. It was a way process thanks to those guys. I will definitely send my friends, family and employees to Quantum Auto sales. If you are looking for a new used good car and a great deal call these guys, ask for Tony the lion and Alex and you wont leave without the vehicle you want Guaranteed. Thanks you guys for everything and God bless.<//Text>

<Text>Let me start off by saying this truly is a great place & that's not an exaggeration on my part. I was in search of a vehicle that was best suited for my particular needs & wants such as price, reliability & of course luxury for a person like myself who enjoys the finer things in life. The staff there was friendly, helpful & very persistent on making sure all my needs were met which they were too. Thank you so much Quantom Auto Sales & especially you too Ruby for helping me out!!</Text>< pictures>

I had an excellent experience at Quantum Auto Sales in early 2018. It is currently the best car dealership and I would recommend it to everyone seeking to review and check out cars. I was looking for a  car and was at first confused because I was not sure of the type and model that would suit me best. The Representatives are very friendly, and took his time to show me around. He was patient, informative and honest about the cars. Even though I had issues with my credit, The sales team helped me secure a good deal within my means. I normally hate shopping for cars, but Quantum Auto changed my perspective and I enjoyed the whole experience.

There were many car models and makes, and it was difficult to decide what car I wanted. The dealers were very patient with me, and provided me with all the crucial information that made it easy to decide. The Toyota Prius I ended up purchasing was beautiful and well worth the experience. All the dealers in Quantum are very informative and have extensive knowledge about the different car makes. They are all friendly and take their time to understand the needs of all their customers. In addition, they conduct follow-up after the purchases.

In their online website, the clients are able to view all the vehicles and inventory. Their online platform is active, and customers are able to check out the cars online before they make purchases. I am certain that I could never receive better car dealership services elsewhere. The car I bought is working fine and so far, I have not experienced any challenges.< /text>

<text>I went in really helpful people I told them my credit was bad and no dealers were trying to help me out. They didn’t care if my credit was bad they were just trying to help me do the best to get me financed. This place had variety of cars most places didn’t really have the car I was looking for or said can’t get those cars and tried to get me another car but thanks to Quantom,Now I can say I’m a proud owner of a gs 350 f sport. Thanks guys I really appreciate definitely sending business there way.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

I was a victim of classic bait and switch. The price the vehicle and down payment was 3 times was they quoted.  Alex- sales person refused several phone calls or to help aid.  Alex was overbearing and pressing, consistently lied, and was disrespectful to my wife with condescending tones.  The entire staff colludes to defraud the customer with classic used car salesman tactics.  I was enticed onto the property, by Alex, who clearly lied and refused to take refuses to take any responsibility- much like my 9 year old daughter.  THEY ARE A SCAM!!!! They</Text>

I just cleaned a part they said they fixed and the die job wiped right off. Do not buy a car from these people!!! The only good thing from this place is ray in the auto shop.

Gerardo and Alex are 2 guys that made it happen for me at Quantum Auto sales. Im in a situation without established credit and they found away to put me in a car and Alex came and picked me up 45 minutes away.  I highly recommend going through these guys because they literally go the extra mile for you. !!
Had a small issue and  they had it resolved almost instantly.  And the car is exactly what I wanted !  Good job guys ! Thankyou<//Text>

Webpage does not display prices on cars. Social media customer services is bad, maybe they change prices depending on the customer..
should list prices in their social media posts  and specially at their webpage. No everyone is willing to drive 45 min to their dealer to check on prices and not everyone will be asking for prices on 15-20 cars.< /Review>

Gerado was amazing. I would recommend him to anyone. He worked really hard to help me get into a vehicle that was right for my family. He was very professional and got me into an amazing car yesterday. I am very thankful for the team at quantum auto sales and definitely will be doing future purchases through them and referring my family and friends. Thank you so much quantum and a big thanks to Gerado!!!</review>

<text>Go to Quantum auto sales in Esco. And ask for Lion!! I’m ecstatic! Let’s just say I have less than perfect credit and I thought getting approved for a car was going to be a nightmare. I was able to text him while I was at work and he got me pre approved Right away! Super nice and GENUINE guy!  I was in and out with the exact car I wanted! Super stoked!</text>< pictures>

Thank you Mike and Gary you guys made it possible for me to drive off with my first car. I had horrible credit but they still worked with me. I had a budget and though I won’t get something nice but man they worked with me and got me in a Volkswagen Jetta 2015 with low miles. I love my car so much and it’s all thanks to Quantum. Once again Thank You Mike And Gary.</Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Nobody at this lot is trustworthy. The car I bought here had minor issues which they said they would fix before I bought it. One month in and the left window stopped rolling down, the radio stopped working, the auto lock is just shoved in and somehow water leaks from the roof when it rains. I wouldn't be complaining if i got a reasonable price for the car but it was ridiculously overpriced. They ghetto rig all the problems any car has just to pull one over you. Save yourself the trouble.</Text>< pics>

<review>Highly Recommend Alex Ayala, Was Not approved at other places , Spoke to Alex on Facebook , got me approved instantly , told me he guaranteed to approve me didn’t believe him , came in and did what he promised left with my Silverado , thank you Alex GO TO ALEX. , GREAT salesman , ask For Alex he’s the guy to see at Quantum, Treated me like family and didn’t disappoint me thanks ALEX will be back soon for a car for my mom ! 09/05/2018

Came back to Alex and Santos to buy my Second Car with them , I litteraly went to 6 other dealers none of them approved me because I already had a car loan . I came to Alex and right away was approved for my Jeep Grand Cherokee 2015 , it did not take long for Alex to approve me and Santos to go over my options and payment plan , they helped me get a car in my time of need for a bigger car and saved me the headache of having to trade in my other car as that’s what all the other dealers wanted me to do. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALEX AND SANTOS , I came back to them for the 2nd TIME and will continue to bring my buisness to them as they are the only dealer that doesn’t complain or make excuses to deny you !

<Review>I was In search of a reliable car and the guys at Quantum really helped me out. They worked to get me in a car that was in my budget. After continuous run arounds at other used car dealerships I decided to go to Gerardo at Quantum and I recieved professionalism and a level of friendliness I had yet to experience at other dealerships. Definitely recommend Quantum Auto Sales Of Escondido for your next car purchase.<//Review>< time>

<review>I want the whole world to know that I bought my car at Quantum Auto Sales in Escondido CA. The car I purchased there was not just a car, it was my dream car a 2005 MBZ E-55 AMG. Excuse me very much but
how's that for a rainy day? I really would like to recommend everyone to go to Quantum in Escondido, they gave me a great deal and made my dream come true.<//review>< pics>

I went to Quantum to check out a certain vehicle i was helped by Hector, what a wonderful Experience, the car i wanted wasnt at this lot,so  he checked around and found many possibles for me to decide on, his knowledge was very impressive , he told me what was available , the milage each had colors,price, all the Bonuses the lil Xb had.
If your ineed of a great vehicle go talk to Hector At Quantum Motor in Escondido

To try & drive away with her car & it didn't even turn on so another week in the spare car & then Mike Puts her into a 2014 Nissan Versa Sv for $400 a basic car not a luxury now 6 months later wit all the regular maintenance her Car just STOPS working.

(Translated by Google) Very organized shop, new and reliable cars. I was very well attended! Jerry and his team are experts in helping you drive out of the store in your new car. When I explained to them that I had sold my car and had no way to go with them, Jerry sent someone from his store to pick me up at my house and very quickly I returned home with the car of my dreams. I think that's it, they really want you to make your dreams come true. I will definitely buy my next car with them !!! Thanks Quantum !!!

Tienda muy organizada, autos nuevos y confiables.  ¡Estuve muy bien atendido!  Jerry y su equipo son expertos en ayudarlo a salir de la tienda conduciendo su nuevo automóvil.  Cuando les expliqué que había vendido mi auto y que no tenía forma de ir con ellos, Jerry envió a alguien de su tienda a buscarme a casa y muy rápidamente regresé a mi casa con el auto de mis sueños.  Creo que eso es todo, realmente quieren que hagas realidad tus sueños.  Definitivamente compraré mi próximo auto con ellos !!!  Gracias Quantum!!!<//text>
