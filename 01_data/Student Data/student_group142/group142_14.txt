<username>Mae Harris<//username><date>1619200751811<//date><Rating>4<//Rating><Review>I went for an oil change and they did not apply the $20 discount that was clearly advertised on the website. I called and the only thing they did was say "I'm Sorry we forgot but there's nothing we can do about it." I'm so upset.

Update: After filing a complaint through HQ and expressing my dissatisfaction, a couple of hours later, I got a call from the manager, Eric. He says "come on back. I'll honor the discount and reimbursed $20". I'm happy now and is satisfied with customer service. I'll change the stars from 1 to 4</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Stopped by at this location for an oil change.  I was in and out within 30 mins.  The location offers 3 service bays and has a small waiting area.  I stopped in to use a Groupon deal and it was no hassle at all.  The people here were nice and I look forward to visiting here again.<//review>

Pulled into shop.  Was told the wait time would be 45 minutes.   I needed an oil change and had a $20 off coupon so I waited and waited.  One and a half hours and $40 dollars after the coupon later, I walked to get my car.  Dirty handprint on my seat.   Spoke to mgr. who cleaned it.  My car was not vacuumed, the outside windows were not cleaned. No reminder sticker, so no fluid tipoff within 3000 miles.  Left sadly disappointed.
Note - found out that an oil change at the dealer also costs $40.  Guess that is my destination for my next oil change.< /text>

I came in for a oil change and the next day when I was on the way home from work my skid plate came off and was dangling scraping the floor. Called the manager at jiffy lube and was told to bring it in to fix it. I came in and told the tech the situation he said "yea I could see the plate dangling when you pulled up we will get that fixed.." Their idea of fixing it was to put zipties to hold it up which they did not tell me until my husband asked how it was fixed and then Eric apprehensively told him it was being held by zipties. My husband didn't appreciate that they damaged our car and would not take the steps to fix it properly. The manager Eric then told us he would fix it properly and to give him a week. We called back after a week and Eric told us the part had been ordered, but turned out he did nothing to start the process in fixing our car. He told us he needed another week to get things in order. We tried to escalate the problem, but he didn't want to and said he is handling it. After all this Eric then called my husband back now saying that it's unclear that there was anything wrong in the first place with the skidplate and now he cannot fix the car because he doesn't feel responsible. Eric demonstrated poor customer service skills and inability to take care responsibility for a problem which his workers created. We still have not heard back from anyone at jiffy lube and it's been 2 weeks I've been driving around with zipties under my car. I've been coming to this jiffy lube for 8+ years, but definitely have lost me and my family as a customer.< /Text>

Since I was slightly overdue for an oil change and limited on time I was looking for something quick and easy in the city. It's somewhat hard to find a place in SF that will just do an oil change that doesn't require leaving your car there the whole day.</Review>

A lot of needless up selling, they broke a part in the car and said they'd do ME a favor by installing the new part for free. Didn't know the part cost 140$. Didn't discount for the inconvenience and they check that they vacuumed and they very clearly didn't. They were pretty pleased to throw "car speak" with the assumption they could up sell by attacking what they thought was an ignorant consumer.

Be wary of someone purposefully using language they think you won't understand.<//text>

<review>After spending almost $4,000 in repairs for my car, I got my car back in even WORSE condition and barely drivable! Now my check engine light is on, two cylinder misfires, has trouble starting, and it barely has any power to move after stopped. NONE of these were issues before. They told me they weren’t sure what was the issue...so basically had been charging me thinking “maybe it’s this, maybe it’s this.” Oh, and I asked them not to mess with the back right window because I think it’s off the track. Well they did and now I can’t get the window back up. I wish I never brought my car in because now I can’t even use it whereas before it was just that I needed brake fluid, oil change, and coil replacement....I’m not one to leave one star reviews, but Jiffy Lube has lost my business. I am beyond frustrated. I could’ve bought a used car at this point, my car isn’t even worth $4,000.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

My husband went to get his oil changed. They were about to close so they rushed his oil change. Didn’t plug the oil back up in the bottom of the car. The car stalled twice then the heads blew the next day before we could figure out what the problem was. In turn, my husband lost his car the day after a regular oil change thanks to them<//Text>

I brought my car in to have them check if my brakes needed to be done.  I was told that my front brakes and rotors both were due. After having the repairs done, I checked my records and the front brakes and rotors had just been done less than 6 months and under 2500 miles previous. As a women who is not savvy with mechanics, I trusted their evaluation and advice. When confronted after the fact, they had no explanation. I had all of the paperwork to prove that the repairs they recommended and provided were unwarranted and unneeded. I have been trying for 3 weeks to get some kind of resolution. I talked to the manager who said he needed to consult with the district manager. After a week with no reply, the manager suggested I come in again to write an "incident report." It has now been another 2 weeks since my incident report was submitted and there has been zero response from their district manager. I don't know if they were negligent or knowingly provided unneeded repairs, but either way I feel like I've been taken advantage of and their corporate office does not seem to care at all.

They also improperly installed my engine cap after checking fluids which caused an engine misfire (which they noted in my exit paperwork). They sent me away with it anyway without checking their work. I found out what happened when the check engine light came on shortly and I brought it in to my dealer. They found the state of the engine cap which had not been touched since I'd been at Jiffy Lube.<//text>

You should be ashamed of yourself ripping people off. I will NEVER go to ANY jiffy lube again. An air filter that costs over half the cost of the whole synthetic oil change.

So the manager replies to this post asking for me to email him with my contact info and what not. I did so expecting to get a call or an email back to discuss what happened and how we can make things right.  Well I haven’t received a email or a call at all, the response is probably there to make it seem as if they’re going to do something to right their wrong when in fact they’re not going to do anything. :/

I came here to get an oil changed and they did that, even told me about the other problem i had with the car.  But when I got it back I had all kinds of oil fingerprints everywhere. I wasn’t too bothered by it cause I could jus wash it off.  Buuuuut after noticing a black streak across my shirt I realized the idiots rubbed their fingers all across my seat belt and ruined a bunch of my shirts.
Do not go here.  Extremely unprofessional for doing this.<//Review></record>

I was told they were trying to fix my glove box that wasn’t broken before I got there. I was told that the clip was broken. I was told to bring it back to have a manager look at it. I was told a manager would call me back but it’s been a week now. Why make a commitment to call when you’re not. This is my 2nd complaint to corporate regarding a call back. Very poor customer service.<//Review>

Ok, so you get what you pay for. Honestly the prices are outrageous but you are in and out of the place in a flash. Their service would be quicker if not for the up-sells. Why did you pull out my air filter to show me it was ok- I know it was ok, I had just changed it myself. Anyhow, the workmanship was ok. I paid a few bucks more because they said my coolant needed to be topped of. But then My car leaked coolant all day because the techs overfilled the coolant. I use this place as a last resort. I needed an oil change before my drive up north. A little more planning and foresight and I could have gone to a place more reasonably priced.<//review>

I just had 4 new spark plugs & fuel injectors installed less than 6 wks ago from AAMCO & manager @ Jiffy Lube recommended replacement of same items. 🤬 what a scam to try to push unnecessary cost of repairs on an unsuspecting woman alone not really checking if the work needed to be done! I give negative 👎 0 stars. Inside oil change reminder sticker on windshield was for different car. Invoice said wash exterior windows & vacuum floors; neither were done. Only makes me wonder how much of the other items on invoice were actually done! I would NOT recommend this location. As I am sure other locations are true to their word,<//review>

<Text>Was not a big fan of these guys......a long time bait and switch pricing scheme was going on here for years. But now they give you up front pricing before they begin working on your vehicle.  The new store manager Mike is doing a great job and Tee was the guy who worked on my car did a professional job too.

As soon as I pulled up I was greeted and walked over to the waiting area. (I just went in for an oil change.) Every few minutes someone would come by and make sure I was good, and even after my oil change was complete... the way in which they explained the recommendations didn't make me feel as if they were trying to sell me more. It was like if they wanted to genuinely help me out. If I could give more stars I would.< /text>

Went in for oil change and Tech was having a problem underneath my truck the manager Mike wasn't there at the time but when he returned (these guys were a little paranoid about making it worse) anyway Mike the manager went down himself with the tech fixed the problem. MIKE was extremely professional and good spirited about the whole thing thank you Mike . The tech came up and apologize to me, I told him there was no need to apologize you just learned something he  smiled and said yes I did

<Text>Pretty much what the previews commenters said. Just had no choice cause I was well over my mileage for an oil change and was pretty close to where I usally am. Greeter said that Oil change up front says $120, then when the bill came it was $140. PZL platinum Synthetic only cost $40  they charge a $100. Also, almost forgot to put back a cover plate below the engine. Not coming back, seriously regretted that i came here.

EDIT:
Full synthetic oil last 15,000 miles and one of them said to change every 5,000 and miles. Its either they dont know theyre own stuff or the oil they used on my car is not full synthetic oil. This place is so shady. Shouldve listened to previous comments, take your money elsewhere and you WILL save money.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMvpXPA5a086Z8rlXTed_1Bub19mHjivKbj5D5m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>I came to Jiffy Lube because my brakes were failing and they told me I needed 4 new brake pads and rotors as well. They didn’t do any other tests on my car to see why my brakes were failing, but told me I had about 2mm of brake pads left. I regretfully spent $800 on all new break pads and rotors and two weeks later my breaks failed on me. I took my car back to this Jiffy Lube and now they said I need all new brake lines, because my brake fluid was leaking, which would cost another $800. My brake pads and rotors were better than fine when I purchased the car two months ago. If they would have done a proper diagnosis on my car, I could have saved the $800 on brake pads and rotors and just repaired the brake lines. I would never come back to this place, I would never recommend it to anyone, I think they are horrible liars and when they did the break pads and rotors and filled up the break fluid they were only masking the real issue with my breaks. I’m lucky I wasn’t driving on the freeway or had to come to a quick stop when my breaks failed me. Save your money and go to a real mechanic.</Review>< user_id>

Haven't had a bad experience with them. I only go to them for oil changes only. Nothing else. I know they provide other services, but I'd rather go to a real mechanic for those needs.

PRO TIP: Make sure you go to the Jiffy Lube website and download the coupon. Not the regular $5 off coupons though. Enter your zip code and you'll get coupons that give better discounts.< /review>

< Review>
My mom (in her late 60's) dropped off her Ford F150 for an oil change and when she returned to pick it up later, it would not start. In fact it wouldn't even turn over. She had not experienced any problems with the truck prior to leaving it in their care. When the tow truck came to tow the truck home, the driver said this was the 3rd vehicle he picked up from them that week, all with same problem. Started and drove fine before they touched it. The tow truck driver seems to think they are sabotaging cars so customers will pay them to "fix" it. This is dishonest business practice and needs to be reported!!!</Review>

<text>I just left this location and only needed an oil change. I was VERY SPECIFIC about that to  the guy that was filling out my work order. Sure enough when its time to pay they added an additional  $40 worth of "work" charges that they SUPPOSEDLY did to my car. I confronted the man who did my work order in front of all (6 or so) Mechanics whom kept saying that I requested it and sure enough he says "No she wanted just the oil change and nothing more its on the work order"... Everyone had a dumb look on their face like it wasnt SO OBVIOUS that they are dirty business men with NO SHAME in their attempts to get over on me cause Im a women. Sure enough I left that place with 56% oil life. I will upload photo with time stamp.</text>< time>

<text>Thanks Jiffy lube! On my new (I got it used but it's new to me) 2013 Chevy Impala LT.
The Mfg. recommenced oil is a synthetic blend! OMG bye-bye $19-$25.00 oil & filter changes. I got a get deal at Jiffy lube and the Impala purrs like cat. Will maybe a 300HP tiger... So keep your car in the groove and stop by Jiffy lube.

< Review>
They were slammed with a bunch of Uber cars. I have been coming to this location for a while now and today reminds me why. My oil pressure was low to the point the check engine light came on. Rin and John would didnt allow my situation to get worse. John understood many problem. He approach Rin and he made a call that has earned my loyalty. He allowed my car to get worked on and I am no longer worried i will burn out my motor on the freeway. Thank you for everything and I'm sure many others share the same view. Thank you Rin and John! #builttolastbusiness<//Review>

<date>1613270094068</date><Text>Geno was amazing! He told us everything we needed to know about the car we were interested in but never pressured us. He was personable, courteous, accommodating, and he treated my young adult son with respect, making his first car buying experience a great one. Andre checked us out quickly and made the administrative part of buying the car an absolute dream. It was organized, straightforward and so quick, yet thorough. The very best part was that after our own mechanic checked the car over from top to bottom, we found that it was everything and more that they said it was - good tires, newer battery, clean oil, engine compartment clean, absolutely no oil leaks in a 10 year old car, good brakes, very sound overall. We could not be more pleased.<//Text></record>

With covid19 guidelines in place this dealership does NOT practice social distancing nor do any of them wear masks. Guy named Sam walks right into your personal space to talk to you. Did I mention their customer service is poor?</text>

<Review>Staff was friendly and helpful and took great care of us well. They explained all of the warranty and Gap options etc, but did not pressure us at all to take them but we did :)
We found them on Car Gurus when looking for a Subaru Crosstrek and price they had posted was several thousand dollars under the Car Gurus "market price". The car is beautiful and we are very happy with our purchase.</Review></record></dataset><record>

This dealership is top notch! Fantastic service on all levels. Sales, managers and finance are all great people to work with. In my opinion, the respect you receive at a dealership is a make or break for me. All the Choice Auto employees that I dealt with were not only respectful but also extremely helpful. I recommend this dealership to everyone!</Text>

BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT: Do your research, know what your willing to spend, and don't get upset if they don't want to haggle with you.

I was honestly nervous about buying from Choice after reading many of the reviews here. But, before you move on to another auto dealer, let me shed some light on where (I believe) most of their negative reviews come from.

Andre and his team aren't the most warm and flowery people. And I think that's where customers are usually put off. Customers are used to car salesman being very warm and inviting and complimentary. Andre and his team are curt to the point that they may come off as rude to some people. But honestly, I liked it. I showed them respect, they showed me respect, and nobody had to suck up to anyone else. It was a very mature atmosphere to buy a car, and I appreciated it.

Also, they don't like to haggle, which I can appreciate because they also didn't try to upsell me. They had an amount they were willing to sell at, I had an amount I was willing to buy at, those figures met, and we struck a deal. I asked if they could go lower, they respectfully declined, and that's okay.

Finally, if you're concerned about getting a lemon, do what I did: have a mechanic inspect the car before you finalize your purchase. It was $100, and it gave me full peace-of-mind. Andre was totally okay with my mechanic putting that car to the test.

I couldn't have been happier with my experience at Choice Auto.<//text>

Put my family's life at risk by selling me a van with a bad cv axle. On way home, the van shook violently when accelerating. How would they not know that? Dishonest. If buying here, insist on a freeway drive. Better, avoid. Sure, the salesman was nice, but its not cool to spend 10k on a car with  a bad (dangerously bad) axle, and put my family in danger on the way home. BOO. BOO. BOO.</text>

<text>My review is the one you'll want to read about this place. We had a phenomenal experience here. I found a listing for the vehicle I've been on the hunt for (a nice Toyota Sequoia) at this location at a great price. I called and they told me it was sold, but they had an identical vehicle just one model year older. I went to the website and looked to see that it looked great and identical to the one I called for. My husband and I drove from Modesto to their lot first thing in the morning & arrived just before 10am. We were greeted on the lot by a very friendly guy (I didn't get any of their names, we had our two year old and newborn with us so I was too preoccupied for catching names). I told him I'd called about the sequoia and he immediately invited us inside while he went to grab it. We were greeted by another extremely friendly man inside. The sequoia was pulled up and they walked away and gave us time to check it out inside and out. After a few minutes, one of them walked up and offered to let us take it out for a ride without us even asking to do so. When we got back from the test drive, my husband requested we take it to a mechanic to make sure it was cleared (the carfax report was incredible though) and without any hesitation he said that was perfectly acceptable staying on Fulton Rd. We went with Firestone nearby because there was no wait for an inspection. They did a thorough inspection and said the worst they found was a loose hubcap. It is a perfect vehicle. We took it back to the dealer and told them what they said and that we were going to our bank to pick up our loan check. When we returned, they brought the sequoia out with the stickers removed. They also replaced the hubcap with a new one, and replaced the key fob batteries and DVD player remote batteries. The transaction went smoothly, and they were so friendly the entire time. To us and both of our babies! They loved them! I was nervous about what our experience was going to be like after reading some reviews, but I'm so glad we went. I got an awesome vehicle at an awesome price and they guys that work there were wonderful. All I can assume from the other negative reviews is 'there's two sides to every story' and people these days are less than honest. So, if you find an awesome vehicle from them, I highly recommend going. & if you're nice and friendly with them, they will be exactly the same with you and it's worth it. I felt compelled to write this after reading what others had to say, and having such a pleasant experience with them today. I hope anyone who visits them can enjoy it, too.</text>< userid>

<Text>if you are looking for a car please go see Gus at Choice Auto... My husband and I were in the market for a new car when we pulled up to Choice Auto and were greeted by Gus. Gus made sure that we had a very pleasant experience and he had handled everything for us from A to Z.
He also made sure we got a great interest rate and a great deal on GAP protection. We bought lots of cars in our days, yet the wonderful experience at Choice Auto and level of professionalism by Gus made it truly memorable. Thanks Gus</Text>< Pics>

Gus is a good buyer...he shops the trade-in market carefully for the most desirable vehicles and well-maintained.   They had exactly what I was looking for, and their pricing was spot on.   I was willing to drive 100 miles from the Bay Area to make my purchase at Choice.</review>

< Review>
The selection of cars is really good, and the cars are all in great shape.  They seem to really care about having well taken care of cars and having the most competitve prices.  We bought a 2014 Fiat 500L that got trade in with only 9,000 miles - and the price Wally (mgr) offered was thousands less than any others we had found!  And we were out the door in about 30 minutes!!!</Review>

DO NOT SHOP HERE - ILLEGAL, SCAM ARTISTS, FRAUD

I never write reviews online but simply made an account to share my HORRIBLE experience with these SCAM ARTISTS.

2 days ago, I purchased a used Audi from them. Price was 9,998. After reviewing and inputting  exact details offered by Choice Auto into Kelly Blue Book, worth came up around 8,000. After arriving at their lot, we began to haggle with one of the two men at the front. He did not speak very much english and made this interaction difficult, although that is not at all my complaint.

We asked “$9,998 is a little high for this car, is it not?” He turned his computer screen around to us and said what we could only understand as “This is cheap. My profit is 900. I need to make a profit on this. This or nothing.” We of course understood, and the Audi being such a wonderful car, we took the deal.

Fast forward after we pay, we’re driving home and the CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON. We’re not too worried, assuming that’s what we get for purchasing a used car. We already had a scheduled appointment with our trusted mechanic, Ryan GMW (North Aurburn, CA. Definitely give him your business if you have a European car! He’s great and knows exactly what he’s talking about!)

By the time we get home (20 miles) and pull into our driveway, the car begins to smell funky. Smoke is coming out from under the hood. We shut the car and back away. We lift the hood but can’t see what is wrong. We allow the engine 20-30 minutes to cool, then try to finish bringing it up the driveway. Car doesn’t start.

Car. Does. Not. Start.

We tried and tried for at least 20 minutes and it sounded similar to my ‘81 Ford when the battery died and it was left sitting for 30 years.

The next day, we took the car to Ryan GMW.

We were then informed that the car would not pass smog. The issue here was, the car was “smogged” 9 days ago. Ryan explained to us wha had gone wrong in the car would not happen in 9 days after passing smog. He said over 7 codes were run on this car.
He said this car has been illegally smogged and there is not plausible way these people did not know there was something wrong with the car.

Add to that, he said he had the exact same car for sale on his resale lot for 7,000! He said our car had 60,000 miles over what his had and yet this one was still more expensive! He said this car was no where NEAR $10,000, let alone 8,000.

In addition, Choice offered to charge us $350 for a warranty. Ryan informerd us by C.A. law, used cars sold under $10,000 can only had a warranty sold for around $150. It wa sillegal to charge $350.

In all, the car was illegally overpriced, the engine has failed, the car has run 7 negative codes of parts failing, lastly but MOST IMPORTANT - Ryan says the car was illegally smogged.

Not sure if anyone else has gone through this with them, but am currently on the phone with the Automotive board filing a formal complaint and am suing them for what needs to be fixed. This is highly illegal.< /Text>

<time>1372819279196< /time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>I had been looking for a used 4runner for about a month when I found Choice Auto and Truck on craigslist. They had the vehicle I wanted, color and all. My husband and I went to see the truck and the first thing Kevin, the sales man said to us was they just discovered an oil leak on the vehicle and it was scheduled to be fixed the following day. We test drove the vehicle and decided to buy it. Because of their great choices of high quality vehicles my husband also bought a car that day. After having the 4runner for less then a day my check engine light came on. I called Kevin and he said no problem, bring it in and we will take care of it. We took the truck in and problem solved, they changed my O2 sensors and replaced my rear oil seal. A couple days later my starter went out and my check engine light came back on. Again, I called Kevin and told him the problem, he said no problem....bring it in and we will take care of it. I brought my 4runner in again and they replaced my starter and my catalytic converter. To our surprise all these things were replaced no charge to us. My husband and I knew Choice Auto and Truck were under no obligation to fix any of these things by law, but they did. We just drove our 4runner to AZ and it drove beautifully...No problems! Kevin told us over and over again how they go through the vehicles they buy with a fine tooth comb and they stand behind their vehicles and it is true. We are very happy with both of our vehicles. Andrea in financing was great as well. And I believe Wally had a lot to do with making sure our 4runner was fixed. It is likely that we will buy our next vehicles from them! And we have told many of our friends and family about this dealership as well.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<text>I bought a 2005 Excursion and less than 24 hours later the engine light went on and it would stall several times while stopped in drive. It's been in the shop longer than at home and everyone I have talked to say that Choice Auto N' Truck had to know about this issue and cleared the codes to sell the vehicle. I went to them to see what they would do, but all I was offered was a free inspection. I don't trust them with my vehicle. For some reason, it's been at the Sacramento Ford Dealership and other places for over 5 weeks and no one knows what wrong with my vehicle.

Other than the stalling, it's a nice vehicle and I am happy with it, but stalling and having issues is not cool. I would never buy a vehicle from them again.</text>< userid>

I had been looking for a used 4runner for about a month when I found Choice Auto and Truck on craigslist. They had the vehicle I wanted, color and all. My husband and I went to see the truck and the first thing Kevin, the sales man said to us was they just discovered an oil leak on the vehicle and it was scheduled to be fixed the following day. We test drove the vehicle and decided to buy it. Because of their great choices of high quality vehicles my husband also bought a car that day. After having the 4runner for less then a day my check engine light came on. I called Kevin and he said no problem, bring it in and we will take care of it. We took the truck in and problem solved, they changed my O2 sensors and replaced my rear oil seal. A couple days later my starter went out and my check engine light came back on. Again, I called Kevin and told him the problem, he said no problem....bring it in and we will take care of it. I brought my 4runner in again and they replaced my starter and my catalytic converter. To our surprise all these things were replaced no charge to us. My husband and I knew Choice Auto and Truck were under no obligation to fix any of these things by law, but they did. We just drove our 4runner to AZ and it drove beautifully...No problems! Kevin told us over and over again how they go through the vehicles they buy with a fine tooth comb and they stand behind their vehicles and it is true. We are very happy with both of our vehicles. Andrea in financing was great as well. And I believe Wally had a lot to do with making sure our 4runner was fixed. It is likely that we will buy our next vehicles from them! And we have told many of our friends and family about this dealership as well.< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Absolutely the worst experience! I should have read the previous reviews. The owner/staff don't know anything about customer service. When called out on their customer service the owner kicked me out. Mind you, I am a 5 ft woman, him (Wally) a 6 foot + male. They were rude, disrespectful and I can dare to say violent. If it wasn't for my husband asking him to stop yelling at me I truly believe he would have charged at me. Women and people of color beware! Stay away from this dealer. I have never in my life been treated this way.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It was my first time trying to finance and after telling them about my situation he just said I don't qualify with a very disappointed and annoyed attitude.

We were ready to buy on the spot, except when we pointed out obvious disrepair issues - crack on windshield, passenger door window screeching when opening/closing, both visors without lids and therefore visor lights that didn't work... they didnt wan't to negotiate. We walked away so frustrated, not because we didn't get the car, but because they had major attitude. There are so many other decent places where you'll be treated with respect and courtesy. We did find a car, at the next dealership we went to and it was like night vs. day with the treatment we got. Forget Choice Auto, you'll be wasting your time and money.</Review>< Pics>

Not honest dealer
Clears engine check lights on vehicles and sells them.
I bought and  had issue catalytic concerters when it was time to smog .
They  fake smog . Ford f150 only takes federal catalyic converters . It will never pass smog with after market ones .
I had check light next day, many codes. After market converters were illegal. Went to them they just cleared the lights away.
Never going back. Vehicles don't go thru any inspections but detail only .
Good luck to the ones those are happy with their purchase.</Text>

Just came from the lot...had the same experience as most of the other one-star reviewers. They are not joking. Stay away.
Drove 82 miles up from San Francisco to look at a vehicle and 1. We weren't allowed to take the car out for a test drive except on the route they allow. It's one block in all directions...and they tell you you have 5 minutes to come back with the car. Right off the bat that's shady and NOT appreciated. When you test drive a car you want to gas it, feel the acceleration on the highway, etc. (For what it was worth the 1 block test drive was fine...not that we followed the rules) 2. We go inside to start talking price and we meet with Gus. Sloppy sales guy with no real motivation to sell a car, "because he had already sold 4 cars today." I'm not joking. This guy wouldn't negotiate with us because he had already met his daily quota. Bet the owners love this guy. Regardless, it's not the fact that we couldn't come to terms on the price of the car - that happens - it's the attitude we got when we didn't buy the car. We asked Gus to call his boss/owner and see if we could get the car a little closer to where we felt comfortable, and he totally dismissed us, looked out a side door instead of looking at us, didn't even thank us for coming in or shake our hand as we left. Needless to say we took our cash-in-hand and bought the same car at Automotion just a few (14) miles up the road in Roseville from Mike Glasser. In conclusion, if you are reading this review be advised that you are dealing with a low class group of guys that doesn't really care about you - just your money! I feel bad for all the people that got gypped buying from Choice.< /text>

DO NOT BUY A VEHICLE FROM THIS PLACE! They are deceptive, dishonest and sell overpriced cars that need major repairs. The discourteous attitude of the both the owner and salesman is astonishing! What happened to doing what's right and good kind customer service? Believe me you won't find that here. They take advantage of people. Don't fall for their kind accommodating act as they are selling the cars because as soon as you sign on the dotted line their demeanor changes and the arrogance, sarcasm and no care attitude begins along with thousands of dollars in repairs.< /review>

I have done my research on Toyota 4runners, and I found this lot advertised one of the only list prices under blue-book for a retailer. Curious as to why, I took their very clean '05 4runner down to my mechanic, who found it to be an overall sound vehicle. Unfortunately he discovered a small misfire, which he said could be as simple as a spark plug or an injector, or as serious as bad valves, leading to very expensive repairs down the line. The dealer immediately challenged my integrity and that of my mechanic, and refused to 'fix' anything until I had agreed to buy the vehicle. Obviously that's not a smart move, so I insisted that he fix the problem, then we could make a deal. He wouldn't budge, so bottom line: a potential lemon is sitting on his lot, with his full knowledge, and it's out there just waiting for the naive buyer to come along and be dazzled by his steam cleaning process under the hood. BEWARE OF THIS LOT, DO YOUR HOMEWORK!!< /review>

We visited the dealership and were greeted by Marsha.  She was very calm, and informative.  We test drove two vehicles while we were there, one of which being the Camry.  It seems she would have let us test drive more had we asked.

Marsha mentioned that they do not haggle at their lot, and that they rarely settle for less than the price asked for.  (Again, the price on this car was fantastic, so I could not blame them).  I admired that she stated this before negotiations even began.

I stated we wanted to have lunch be fore we committed to a purchase.  She suggested a nice restaurant that was nearby.  Marsha did not try and pressure us into closing the deal before we left, as most dealerships would.  This showed me she was confident in her asking price, and the quality of the car.

We of course checked out the rest of the dealers on the block after lunch, and found NOTHING that compared in our price range.  We came back to the lot, and purchased the car.

We of course tried to haggle the price anyway. No Dice,  She was not kidding about the no haggle policy.  Though I didn't feel bad about this, because she did mention that up front, and the price was still great.

The cars we looked at were in great condition, and super clean.  Most of this has to due with the previous owner, as it is with most used cars.  The engine compartment was so clean, I would eat off if it (yeah, i'm the type that seriously would).

Overall this was a great experience.  Next car purchase, I will be coming here first.</Review>< Pictures>

We test drove the vehicle twice.  We knew the vehicle needed new rear rotors and breaks. Shortly after driving the vehicle (about a week) it there seemed to be a transmission issue that occurred when the vehicle was warmed up and downshifting from 2nd into 1st gear.  Upon taking it to a mechanic for the work that we knew needed to be done, we were informed that the front driver axil also needed replacement.  Then a battery.  But there seemed to remain a transmission issue.  It was recommended to take the vehicle to Turner Volvo where they replaced the solenoids, rebuild the valve body, and changed the transmission fluid.  I am now into the vehicle more than $2,500 than what I paid for the vehicle.   So disappointed, very dishonest salesmen and establishment.     I do NOT recommend this dealer.<//text>< UserId.>

Don't do business with this place. I bought a SUV and it had a large Crack in the radiator. The maintenance was never done not even a oil change. The first week of owning it was spent 3 days and 7 hours on the tires. A new radiator over $400.00, a tune up that should've been done and was 1,000's of miles over due for $2,000. My friend who is a macanic said there is no way they didn't know about the problems. There crew told me it needed nothing and was in perfect shape. This place isn't honest and I would never recommend them to anyone.<//Text>

What I really loved about this dealership was how easy it was to deal with them. I came in inspected the car with my husband and we did look at multiple cars around th lot before deciding on te Camry and alle cars were in goodcondition and I'll be back for more when my daughter gets her license</review>

<Review>I have never been treated the way I was when my Husband, step son and his family & myself walked onto the lot to look and test drive a SUV.  We were approached by the so called "General Manager", talked to him about the vehicle and asked to test drive it.  His response was, well I'm busy right now but let me see if I can take you for a drive, he went and got the keys, so my husband and son were going to go with him and his comment was "YOU KNOW THAT ONLY 5% OF MY SALES ARE BY WALK ON'S AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LOW BALL THE PRICE ON ME, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOU TO DO THAT, I MAKE MORE MONEY FROM IN INTERNET OFFERS THEN WALK ON'S" I wanted to punch the man, we didnt even go on the test drive, we got out of the car and left...

Well this JERK lost us as customers on a 15,000 vehicle and any future purchase's.  So in reality he's telling us that were a piece is S----T and he doesn't have the time for us.

I will never go there again, and word to the wise, I work at a big company and all of them know not to go their either... I hope you take is experience into consideration as well before going to this car lot.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>One of the few shops that actually makes curvy ladies look good. they don't make skinny clothes try to fit a curvy person they make clothes that fit a healthy sized person first.

I'm so grateful for the customer service coming out of the spot. Miki helped me on two separate occasions while I was picking out lingerie. I asked her all sorts of awkward questions and she was just so kind through all my indecision. I'm very happy with what I bought and I'm sure my boyfriend will be too. Thank you Miki and thank you to Lane Bryant for making clothes that FIT!< /text>

I come in this store often, I always leave with no less then $200-$400 spent and I just went in, I didn’t realize they closed at 7pm I thought they closed at 8, well I was rushed the employees were hesitant on letting me use the dressing room, I get it they were closed, but if someone is already in the store why not let them try on and check out, to me that is customer service, I didn’t  recognize the manager or the employees they must’ve been new or from a different store; either way don’t think I’m going back in. I’d rather buy online. They didn’t even explain, like I’m sorry were closed. Or be apologetic. I worked retail, and that wasn’t cool. Way to want me to spend my money there. NOT!<//Text>

Always a great sale going on. Huge selection! Lots of super cute plus size clothes, t shirts, blouses, jeans, pants, workout gear, dresses, sweaters and beautiful high quality lingerie, bras that actually fit, panties and PJs. Shoes, purses, jewelry too! I love this store!</text>

< Review>
Actually it should be a Zero Star review. I went to this store before an overseas trip looking for a sports bra to wear on the plane.  I was in the store (the only person other than the sales people) for at least 20 minutes and not one person greeted me or asked if I needed help.  All of the sales people were hanging out at the cash register gossiping.  I walked out and went to Bra Garden in Fountain Valley and got what I needed.

Lane Bryant says: "Whether you’re looking for a dress for a night out, a jacket for work, plus size activewear, great-fitting jeans or Cacique sleepwear, panties and bras, Lane Bryant has the style and plus size fashion you want with an emphasis on comfort and fit."  They need to add: the only thing Lane Bryant doesn't have is decent sales people.

I will never step foot in this store again.< /Review>

Marshell has no customer service skills and it seems to as if she needs to get a job where she doesn't have to work with people...she seen me walking in circles looking for something and she stood there and watched me ,until I went and asked her she was very dry, rude and acted as if I was bothering her she pointed to what I was looking for and said that's all they had with out even going in the back to be sure...and while checking out ,I had my elderly mother with me that is partially blind and thought Some undies were 3$ and Marshell said Oh NO THEY'RE NOT NO 3$WITH A ATTITUDE and HER UGLY AS IF SHE WAS BOTHERED) FACIAL EXPRESSION... Making my mom feel dumb .Worst experience ever and I've been shopping at Lane Bryant for years at different locations and Never had to deal with someone like her she's   LAZY AND RUDE AND MUST HATE HER JOB.</review>

The customer service at this store is so bad!  The sales girls never ask if you need assistance, I waited at the counter for quite a bit until one of them came over to ring me up.  I had to wander around the bra section thing to find my size, none of the girls even asked if I needed help finding my size.  I came to exchange an item, one of the salesperson was s ok rude when she tole me one of my items was a "final" sale, so I asked if she could tell me how much my other 2 items would be so I knew how much just could spend and it was as if u was wasting her time!  I have been to this store several times because it's the only close one to me, every time they are just as rude!  The store is supposed to open at 10a.m. and it never open on time!  Someone needs to change the atmosphere here!</text>

Staff is courteous and efficient.  There is always a long waiting room wait for my appointment in this office which is only increased during pandemic period.  Am pleased with the medical treatment I have received from Dr Ghalambor so will continue to wait my turn in the office.<//text>

<Review>Dr Ghalambor was an amazing surgeon and so patient with my treatment. He took good care of me and would highly recommend him to anyone. Unfortunately, the distance for me to drive up to see him became too much. But if your close to Orange County he’s the guy to see.<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Dr. Ghalambor and staff are very knowledgeable, professional and friendly. I will be having surgery soon and have no doubts I am in good hands. I came to this office as a second opinion but quickly switched and chose him for my surgeon after I could see he is highly skilled, has great communication and a great reputation.<//Review>

After completing the initial patient forms, I was escorted to an examination room by the nurse who took a history of my wrist injury and ordered xrays.  A young man completed the scans quickly and jovially.  guided me back to my room to await the PA Onil.  He arrived quickly and gently examined my wrist.  The X-rays revealed no fractures, and he determined that my pain was due to inflammation and a bit of arthritis.  He offered several courses of action, including a cortisone injection which I opted to receive.  He did not attempt to pressure me into any option but guided me in the decision.  It was virtually pain free thanks to lidocaine.  What a genuinely professional, compassionate, gracious and caring young man.  And to a person, even the parking attendant, everyone was equally kind and friendly!  I unequivocally recommend this clinic and staff!!!⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</Text>

I wish that I had found Dr. Ghalambor before my previous surgeries. He and his staff are phenomenal. They get back to me very promptly with anything I need in between visits and when I am there in person I truly feel like I'm being heard and get all of my questions answered fully.<//text>

I saw Dr Ghalambor for about a year for pre and post surgery. Dr Ghalambor did my surgery on my left shoulder.  He and his staff/ assistant are very knowledgeable in all levels of my surgery.
I would highly recommend anyone to him for care.<//review>

Dr Ghalambor and his staff were informative, efficient and helpful during my office visit. From checking in with the staff,  to seeing the Doctor, the visit went smoothly. Dr Ghalambor is friendly and professional, and listened to my specific concerns. I didn’t feel rushed and he answered all my questions. I would definitely refer him to my friends or family if they needed a good orthopedic doctor.<//review>

While my visits, with the exception of the nerve test, were brief, your assistant provided an excellent briefing regarding the impending surgery.  He informed me I would receive surgery instructions either that afternoon or soon.  As of this writing I have yet to receive them.

<Review>Such a great experience. I was taken back to a room right on time, Drs PA came in to get the X-rays and nerve tests up on the screen. Dr Ghalambor came in and we discussed the findings, we discussed options  and made decisions on next steps. I highly recommend Restore Orthopedics, Dr Carlson, Andrew Germanovich DO  and Dr Ghalambor.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcd9c56de591ef:0x476234e0e71f5f3b</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr Ghalambor is an amazing surgeon. I had ruptured my right pectoralis major tendon. He repaired it using a cadaver tendon and an allograft. I had very minimal pain after surgery and have had an amazing recovery since. I was back to work within 5 months which was 6 months earlier then projected. If it wasn't for Dr. Ghalambor I couldn't imagine what shape I would be in after such a sever injury. His office staff was also very kind and helpful throughout the whole process. Thank you for all you do!!!<//Text>

Dr. Ghalambor is by far the best upper extremity physician that I have come across.  I have been providing physical rehabilitation services for many years and treat many patients from different physicians. The patients I treat who have received treatment from Dr Ghalambor and his team have the most successful outcomes. Dr. Ghalambor provides client oriented treatment and caters to each individual’s specific needs. He does everything in his power to provide conservative treatment first before resulting to surgery. I have referred many family members to him because I know they will receive the highest quality of care!!  His office is warm and friendly, willing to help at any means necessary. I can’t say enough good things about Dr Ghalambor and his team!!!!! 😀< /text>

< Review>
Dream tobacco is the premier shop for hookah in Anaheim. Family owned they offer a wide selection of tobacco and accessories to meet the needs of the surrounding people. They even carry Tangier products for the heavier hookah smokers out there. They have a ton of different hookah brands and some weird brands also. Everything is priced pretty reasonably and the staff is kind and helpful. If you're ever in the area I would suggest dropping by because they probably have what you're looking for.< /Review>

Fair prices! honestly these guys know how to run a business, I always go there and get hookah supplies (tobacco, coals, tips, parts ... etc) and I know the whole sale prices for each item, these guys are honest and fair. the store is very clean and organized.

I've been a loyal customer since 2015, and I hate to go to other smoke shops!<//Text>

Bought a hookah for 129. When I brought it home and tried to use it few days later it was not working. I called them to get help and the guy who answered was a jerk and said he is busy and hung up on me.  I will never buy from them again.</Review>

Dream tobacco is the premier shop for hookah in Anaheim. Family owned they offer a wide selection of tobacco and accessories to meet the needs of the surrounding people. They even carry Tangier products for the heavier hookah smokers out there. They have a ton of different hookah brands and some weird brands also. Everything is priced pretty reasonably and the staff is kind and helpful. If you're ever in the area I would suggest dropping by because they probably have what you're looking for.<//text>

<text>Fair prices! honestly these guys know how to run a business, I always go there and get hookah supplies (tobacco, coals, tips, parts ... etc) and I know the whole sale prices for each item, these guys are honest and fair. the store is very clean and organized.

I've been a loyal customer since 2015, and I hate to go to other smoke shops!< /text></record>

Sorry, you dont have my style or size, nor can i order on line and YOUR CLOSING   i will have to find elsewhere to get my clothes. I hsve a closet of db clothes and fortunately for me I lost weight, gone from plus size to regular size, but im tall, and can't order tall in the pants i now need.   And have to give away the 14 n 16 dresses i am swamped in.   Your loss.  Goodbye.</review>

Just a few weeks after I got my truck back, I started to hear noises from the engine and when I opened the hood, I discovered that the caps for the coolant reservoir and the windshield washer fluid were both missing.  I took a closer look and found there was nothing in the coolant reservoir.  I then checked my oil level and discovered that it was very low. I had to add three bottles of oil to bring it up to the proper range.  This fixed the noises I had been hearing.   It appears their tech only did half the job that I paid full price for.  Not long after that, my engine just stopped while i was driving.  Fortunately I wasn’t on the highway so I was just able to pull over and restart it.  Since then it has died two more times. This never happened before I took it in.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Greg and the other techs were extremely helpful and professional. In contrast to associates at Gardena Nissan, which didn’t understand Nissan’s warranty rules, Greg explained Nissan’s policies after taking the time to verify with the manufacturer. His positive attitude, knowledge, and sense of service to the customer, both on the phone and in person, are what an ideal service associate should possess.< /text>

Robert Martel Service Manager is exceptionally knowledgeable, courteous, and trustworthy.  I've been working with him for over 22 years.  Even after I moved to Port Hueneme which is a 40 minute drive 7 yrs ago I continue to  go to Simi for all my service needs.   He's always treated me like a VIP. All my vehicle purchases have been made from 1st Nissan and they have all been new.  It's important to service your vehicles on their recommended schedule.<//Text>

<text>My car needed quite a few things done, it was expensive as there was so much that needed to be done but no one knows my Nissan better, and I’m so excited to say my car feels like new! It hasn’t driven this well since I first bought it and makes it all worth it! With the long list of things that needed to be done they got everything done in a day so I didn’t have to worry about not having a car. I had a tire coming apart from the inside and Rafael was genuinely concerned for me and my safety and wanted to make sure I got the tire fixed under warranty as soon as possible. I really appreciated that, and will definitely return in the future!</text>< Pics>

The service writer came out without a mask and then he kept moving toward me. The young people today just don't get it. I finally backed way off and asked for a manager.  The service was good, but I won't go back.< /Text>

There is a Fast DC charging station on the property. It is paid, so I do not quite understand why it is only for Nissan Leaf cars. Well, I understand the owners want to make it available for their fleet during business hours, but I do not like that they enforce it after hours when it is not being used. It happened this evening, I was driving my Tesla Model 3, and the car was running out of juice, the battery had only a few miles left. This Chargepoint charger was the only fast charger around that I could use. I paid for the session, I was not stealing your electricity. I saw some employees driving by and entering the building, they saw me, and shortly after, somebody completely shut down the station before the session I had paid for was over. That is rude!< /Text>

Had to bring my car in after hearing some noise coming from the rear.  The staff was very professional and attentive.  Listened to my concerns and was very thorough. They communicated throughout the day while my car was there and fixed the noise issue. And of course, I love that my car is clean and sanitized when I come and pick it up.  Thank you.<//review>

Had problems for years with my 2011 Altima. Replaced mass air flow sensor multiple times based on diagnostic readings. Finally took it in to dealership and they had it fixed in 2 days. Had problems with throttle bottle and valve cover. William found a warranty from Nissan that covered the replacement of the damaged throttle body. So far it has worked great since getting it back!< /Review>

I bring my 2010 Cube for service at this dealership. They provide good customer service upon arrival.
I usually do not wait for my car, so if I don't have a ride, I use their courtesy shuttle to be dropped off at home or other locations while my vehicle is being worked on.
They text you on the progress of your vehicle, and the service advisor will call you if anything comes up on the service requested while they're working on the vehicle.
Any questions I've had on the inspection summary, they've always answered. Usually my car is washed before its returned and the cashier is pleasant when paying for my service upon pick up.
I receive a survey via email afterwards and any issues can be taken care of through this survey too. I enjoy having my vehicle serviced at this dealership.<//text>

I really enjoy my experience going to 1st Nissan for service.  A nice waiting room that makes the time go by comfortably.  I am kept up to day with the progress of my service.  I feel like family.  This is why I drive from the Valley to Simi to have my service done right.< /text>

I have been a customer of 1st Nissan since I bought my car in November 2014
The service department is awesome. Chris was my service guy from day one until just recently as he left 1st  Nissan. I am now working with Robert. Robert has assisted me in the past and I like him as he is all about the customer, and is all about providing an excellent customer experience. If you are looking for a new vehicle,  or for a dealership to service your Nissan,  I highly recommend 1st Nissan of Simi Valley for all your needs.</text>

<text>Nothing lacking at all! Robert kept me up to date & could have easily upsold me but he didn't. I was concerned about my brakes, but he showed me that they were fine. He did find that my battery was weak but was under warranty, so I only had to pay 25% of the cost. Comfortable waiting room.

AJ and Dinesh gave us a great deal on a vehicle after a bad experience at the Oxnard Nissan. It was worth the drive across town, and I highly recommend their smaller dealership to the one in Oxnard. They understand the meaning of earning your business and will do what they can to make sure you're happy. They followed through on every promise they made, so we will return to this dealership for our next vehicle.</review>

He was so friendly and positive and By far the most informative on the vehicle that I’ve ever experienced. Thank you again!!</Text>

Chad in the service department is a very helpful person. I dropped my car there in the morning without an appointment and i was running late from work. He arranged the shuttle to drop me off asap and he told me not to worry he will take care of the rest. Sure enough he did what he promissed and my car was ready as promissed and everything was great. Thank you Chad for all your help.<//review>

My Salesman, Noah, was so very helpful, kind and a great listener.  He went above and beyond to help me find everything I wanted in a new car.  My Sales Manager, Dinesh, was wonderful to work with.  Also, my Finance Manager, Henry, was extremely helpful and everyone worked so well together as a team.  I could not have been happier.  My late husband had bought two cars from your dealership in the recent past and I am glad that I chose to come to First Nissan straight away in my search for a new car.< /review>

I know very little about cars and Chris was so helpful. When giving me a quote he told me what was absolutely necessary and what could wait a bit longer so I didn't feel like I was being pressured into spending more money, which a lot of mechanics or body shops tend to do. I also got a free ride to work and was able to come pick up my car later from the showroom which was much more convenient than coming back before 6 durring traffic!</Review>

A transmission service includes a filter but they did not put a new one in according to work order so this is why im giving low scores.</review><username>Vanessa Neal< /username><Response>{'time': 1568654231684, 'text': 'Vanessa, it seems as if we fell short of our standards during your visit and we would like to do what we can to remedy the situation.

< review>
The creditor really sealed the deal for me to leave the dealership. He's extremely rude. Made me feel like I was in an interrogation room because I told him that I had an appointment with another salesman on different lot. But I'm extremely happy with the new car I am getting at Toyota of simi valley #NotSponsered</review>

When I was introduced to Pedro I was told that "Pedro would take good care of me" and that he did!  What impressed me the most is that Pedro not only listens, he "hears" what you have to say, especially when it comes to what you want and what you can afford.

In this day and age of millennial "it's all about me" Pedro stands out as one who cares about his customers.

This happens quite a bit. Last time I had my car serviced for transmission, I noticed that the digital readout on the dash that shows general mileage info, MPG efficiency, etc. seemed to have been disconnected, or at the very least had stopped working after the transmission replacement. I had mentioned if somebody could take a look at this to see what the issue may have been. I was met with "that would mean taking the steering wheel apart" and a separate diagnostic to see what the problem was. It would be nice, JUST ONCE, for somebody to actually go out and LOOK at the problem to see what MIGHT be the cause, rather than jump to charging me for a diagnostic!!</Text>

<Review>Over all service and customer care > Everyone is very attentive and knowledgeable.
at anytime if they aren’t quite sure of any question I have they look into it right away and get back to me so very promptly this is also if I’m on phone.
I have recently seen and dealt with Chris and he is very helpful and follows through with my service needs very promptly and reliable.
I know when he is there it adds a extra layer of security for me to know My car is in good hands.
I apologize I don’t remember everyone’s  names.
Raphael and Robert are also very good - seriously i have never dealt with a bad employee all including Chris are very respectful and Courteous.

It was a very pleasing experience shopping with First Nissan.
They patiently worked with me & provided me with various options. I leased a new Nissan without any hassle. Angela, Daniel, Bryan, Noe..were all thoroughly professional and helped me lease the best vehicle. I am surely looking forward to work with them for all my future purchases & lease.

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Took my 2017 Rogue here to have a front license plate bracket installed but I also had other concerns /issues. Rafael blew off my concerns, says issues are ‘normal’ REALLY? Car is still under warranty but he just couldn’t be bothered. No issue charging me $100 for part and labor for a bracket that took 5 minutes to install. I really hate that there is no other local Nissan dealer. For a company that says their customers come first, it’s really disappointing. Oh, and Brian doesn’t respond to messages either. Maybe a new service manager is needed.

ETA - No one responds when you're asked to email them so they can resolve your issue with their service.  BTW - my car still has a major issue that Rafael says is no big deal.  Time to drive into the valley to another Nissan dealer and see if they are willing to help since First Nissan isn't.</Review>< pictures>

This is my second visit to First Nissan, but on both occasions I received great service from the second I pulled up. They were quick to get me set up so I could relax and wait for the service to be done. They also offer a complimentary shuttle service that will take you to most places in Simi while you wait. Both times I brought my car in for service, it was ready within the hour and it was freshly washed. Overall, I was very impressed with the quality of customer service and the quick turnaround of my car.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Kim Ewing at First Nissan in Simi Valley went above and beyond to help me with my new Nissan Versa.  He gave me a great deal on my trade-in.  He helped me pick a car perfect for my needs.  He explained what I was getting and made what would normally be a big ordeal for me, a fun and relaxed experience.  It was a pleasure to get my car at Nissan, and I'll return again when I get my next car.

We just bought a 2014 Rogue. We really like the car with all it's options, more than Honda, Toyota & Hyundai in the same category. Yes, we drove all those cars. Daniel Bradbury, our sales rep, was not only knowledgeable but enthusiastic and just plain nice to work with, a huge plus in the business. His manager, Kim Ewing, was equally good to deal with and the Finance Manager, Henry Sanchez made things move very smoothly< /text>

We got our car from here, and for the past two and a half years we we're driving here 40 min for maintenance. I tried other dealerships close to us, but we were just not getting the customer services that we were looking for. Here they never tried to push a sale on me of unwanted parts. Every time after diagnostics they took they're time to explain to me what's wrong and when I should plan to change it. 100% recommend this place!< /Text>

I went car shopping this weekend around here. Among all the dealerships I went to, Zach and Mitch at 1st Nissan were some of the most helpful guys I talked to. After test driving 3 cars, they went over all my options to lease or buy in a friendly manner and provided me some great deals. I'd definitely recommend them!< /review>

We originally went to 1st Honda to look at Honda Civics/ CRV's but no one bothered to talk to us as we walked the new and used car lots at Honda. We were finally contacted by Ryan who works at the 1st Nissan dealer and began a conversation about what types of car/suv my wife was looking for.    Ryan took the time and showed us the Rogue/ Rogue Sport and all the amenities each model possessed. After his demonstration of all the vehicle had to offer we were impressed with the SUV. We did not even do any research on the Rogue SUV and didn't know the value for the cost of this vehicle. So in the long run we had a long but pleasant transaction with the purchase of the Nissan Rogue. In the end, we purchased the vehicle and was extremely happy with the outcome and customer service with the sales/ financial staff.</Text>

<Text>I am so disgusted with this place. I feel Nissan should not allow this dealership to use their name. The Sales Manager has absolutely no manners as to how to speak to a customer. Today morning I went down with my family to car shop. we did not want a color they had, but we were ready to compromise if they would have given us a good price. the salesman went back and forth with us on the price but we were not convinced. Finally we gave him a price but he was not convinced with that. We were walking towards our car, when the manager Robert Ruiz approached us and started negotiating a deal but we were not interested. He became a little aggressive and started abusing (used F*** words). I was astonished listening to this. I asked him to stop abusing but on top of everything he became racist to me.

I was so taken back with the way I was treated. A simple "sorry sir, we cannot sell you at this price" was sufficient, there was no reason to abuse and treat us like this.

I am so pissed with them and have decided to switch from Nissan to some other brand. I would strongly advise to not approach this dealership, if you want to buy Nissan. Even if you have to drive to Valencia or some other Nissan dealership.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>From the moment I walked in the staff was very attentive, Your service advisor, Rafael Martinez, explained in detail the costs and what the service would entail.  He also made sure the shuttle service was ready waiting for me when I needed to be given a ride back to work. A couple of hours later, Mr. Martinez called me to let me know my vehicle was ready and took the opportunity to explain the great condition your technicians found my car in, how the results of the battery came back, all the warranties that are still covering my vehicle, he really made me feel that Nissan had my back and I had made a good decision in investing into the maintenance of my car. He offered the shuttle to pick me up from work, I never felt this 5 star service anywhere. When I arrived we went over the results of the 45k mile service and he personally walked me to where I could take care of the bill. Everything felt organized, not rushed and made me feel like I was their most important customer. I will definitely bring my car for service again.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1443032457052, 'text': 'Thank you for writing about your visit with us!

The service itself is exceptional. Mayra Lopez is the reason I chose first Nissan. She helped me from the beginning and answered every question I had, and then some. First Nissan has a reputation for service and quality. I got the exact car (370Z Sport) I desired and for the price that was within my budget. I think who ever is motivating this crew of staff might just be in the right thing because other companies are very pushy and at times annoying. This crew however, knows when to get my attention and listens to me when I give them a time frame for contact. If I was the boss, I would consider showing my sincere appreciation by rewarding those who are clearly doing the job correctly. Thanks again staff of First Nissan, and thanks again to Mayra Lopez for your internet service.< /text>

< Review>
NEVER GO TO THEM ALONE - THE MANAGER LIED ABOUT THE STICKER PRICE!!! I am a cancer survivor that went to them to buy myself a car after beating cancer. First thing I said was I did NOT want a white car and I was looking. I also was having surgery in the morning.  But after 6 hours of trying different cars and not having the balls to leave they sold me a white car which I tried to upgrade a couple days later and they said sure but you've lost $4,000 - I have lost all faith in people thanks to this experience and have since been put on anti depressants so I could deal with my horrible decision.  Thanks First Nissan - I now have a trade in - Lucky me huh???</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Best Car Shopping experience ever!
This is the first time my husband and I buy a brand new car. We were still worried and apprehensive about being overcharged or feel pressured to purchase something less than amazing.
Needless to say, I showed up with a check issued by my credit union with low interest (been banking with them +18 years and have credit +780) but guess what!  We almost dropped to the floor when we found out we could actually finance the car through their lender for an even lower interest rate!! The salesperson, Brian C. was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and chilled. What else can I say... We are just so so so impressed and happy:)<//Text>< Time>

<review>I had a fantastic experience here. Their freindly, knowledge, want to please the costumer and most important they do not continuously lie and badger you to buy something you dont want like i ran into at a few other dealerships.
I bought my new Rogue at First Nissan after visiting 4 other Nissan dealerships plus other brand dealerships. This is the place to find what you want Without the headache of pushy, lieing salesmen. Plus my experience was pleasant with all departments...financing to signing my papers.
I was ready to go to a car broker like i have with my previous 2 cars due to the fact of salesmen trying to sell me what i didn't want, when i was upfront and very specific with my needs and wants. And being female it makes it harder to shop for cars......But not at First at Nissan !!!<//review><Resp>{'time': 1535318185947, 'text': 'Denise, thanks for leaving this wonderful feedback!

After half an hour on the phone with pretty much all departments, I was told that my 300ZX will not be serviced anymore by 1st Nissan. The radiator (600$ for 1st Nissan)  what I found for 89$ online is obsolete and my car is obsolete. Great customer service! Thanks 1st Nissan. I will for sure avoid you when I buy a new car.</text>

Never take your car here. From the current customer service to the service technicians it was absolutely horrible. They take an extremely long time so expect to be there all day secondly I spent the whole day there and they didn't even do any work all they did was a diagnostic which is absolutely horrible.

<text>Leaf Drivers beware: I planned a trip through Simi Valley in my Leaf. I planned to charge at First Nissan, which is the only available Quick Charge anywhere close to the area. Unfortunately, even though this charger is listed on Chargepoint and PlugShare as available, it is not operational. When I went in for assistance, I was greeted with total indifference and a couple of excuses. When I used to work behind a counter, I would at least go online and see if I could find a solution for a customer. But not here at First Nissan. One salesman suggested that I could go over to the Chevy dealership and see if they could help me. Another salesman made an excuse:"well, we didn't even have the charger last month". Yes, and in that case I wouldn't have planned my trip around it since it wouldn't have been listed as installed and operational. I would have thought that Nissan would have some sense of understanding that an EV driver can't just pull up to the next gas station. We rely on the very few charging stations here and there. I know that things happen and that chargers go offline, but the thing that disappointed me was that these sales fellows just didn't care. Wasn't their problem. Their commissions are based on sales, not follow through.< /text><gmap_id>0x80e82ec633daf3f1:0xea10d4ffc5322268</gmap_id></record>

<date>1529936022081<//date><rating>1<//rating><text>I guess Nissan doesn’t care about the safety of their customers. I have a broken passenger and rear passenger seatbelt and through a lifetime seatbelt warrenty that I already got confirmed through Nissan Corp. to confirm my car qualifies for it. For over 2 months I have tried to get Simi Nissan to fix it but they tell me they couldn’t get the part that I manage to find on Nissan’s part website in less than 5mins and that I should tamper the seatbelt system (if i do it takes my car off the warrenty). Finally, manage to talk to the service director Brian Dully he said he’ll contact me once he received information on when the belts should arrive, but he never did and I tried calling him leaving him a voicemail to contact me back but never did. It’s been almost 3 months since I’ve tried to get my sealtbelt fixed for safety, but I guess First Nissan doesn’t care since they have to do it for free and won’t make money. They just keep blowing me off or telling me things to try to take my car off warrenty. Thanks First Nissan : - ) you really care.< /text>< Pictures>

Telling me to go back to my country. This guy and dealership could be sued. I won't ever buy a Nissan.</text></record></dataset><record>

They were horrible. I found a car off of CarGurus, and contacted them through the site. They then emailed me the info on the car with the savings, and I thought it was awesome so I called and they assured me that they had 3 Altima's there just like it. After work I drove to simi and when I got there, they said there was no way they could sell it for the price it was listed for in their email and acted like they didn't send it. Total waste of time.< /text>

Its this kind of client focus that keeps me bring my Maxima back to 1st for all of its service. I had a issue with my dashboard gauges after having warranty repair on my dashboard due to a rattle.  The service desk staff was having a hard time understanding my issue so Brian, the service manager took over.  He listened to my story, made sure he understood the problem, and then tested the car to verify the issue. Brian worked up a solution that, in my mind, was the reasonable path forward and I appreciated that.  He also took an extra step in helping keep all of my car keys synchronized after I replaced a lost key, however then found the lost key.  I have to admit I was annoyed that my car was having problems immediately after having the rattle fixed and Brian in every helped make this a non-issue for me.</Review>

<review>By Stephen Galvin: After 21 years it became necessary to replace my '97 Nissan King Cab. I went into the Simi Valley Nissan dealer with a sour attitude. I really only wanted to confirm that my choice to replace the blown engine in my '97 was rsight. I wanted proof that they wouldn't listen to my "low dollars, no extras" demand.
They did not have a pick up that was low and stripped enough for me, but they did introduce me to the Nissan NV200--a total surprise and it met all my needs. It hit my price, my equipment needs, my limit on extras--AND it gave the bonus of an automatic, so my wife can drive it too.
I dealt with Eva. She did everything I asked for, got help when it was needed and followed through well.
Gvie them all 5 stars.< /review>< pics>

This place is horrible. I bought my '09 Accord from here and less than 3 days later the battery died while I was at work. I called Dinesh who sold me the car and he was extremely rude to me as if it was my fault that they didn't do something simple like check the battery before they sold the car. He continued to tell me that I was young and unknowledgable and raise his voice during that conversation. They assured me that everything was checked and in order once I purchased the vehicle three days prior. I had to purchase a new battery from AAA in order to get back home and they did not reimburse me until weeks later. This incident occured in August of 2012. Now on April 2013 less than a year after I purchased the car I need new brake pads. Again, why wouldn't they make sure that the brake pads are all in working order and the vehicle will be ready for the customer yet assure you that they completely check the vehicle inside and out and it should be running brand new because of how "thorough" they are. This dealership is a joke. They clearly do NOT check their vehicles and just want to shove customers out of the door only for them to come back and pay for service repairs and parts for things they didn't check. Do not take buy your car here or take it here for repairs. You'll be sorry.</review>

This review is about 1st Nissan service department! Over four years ago I moved to Simi Valley, and have been bringing my Nissan vehicle to 1st Nissan Simi Valley service department every 5,000 to 6,000 miles for routine maintenance, there was one recall issue, and also had a front window washer unit replaced. 1st Nissan became my go-to place for service. BUT NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE THEM. Here is why: Something changed with this service department over the past 6 months. They now seem to operate on a corrupt line of practice as you hear so often of so many other automotive service shops. They make claims of bogus problems that simply do not exist. I am sure they make a lot of up-sells $$$ on people that are naïve or simply do not know enough about cars and who fall prey to these tactics, but I have worked on all my cars most of my life from changing my own brakes, plugs and fluids to replacing timing belts to replacing entire engines. 6 Months ago I brought my vehicle in for routine maintenance, oil change, tire rotation and even asked them to change out all my air filters. The price was reasonable and I approved the work. When I came to pick up the vehicle the service agent told me there were two serious issues that needed immediate attention or could create a dangerous situation if left unrepaired. He told me that one of my engine motor mounts was broken, and that my timing belt was making noise and that both needed to be replaced (Total cost for both in excess of $1900). Many customers would probably trust the agent and likely pay for the “Needed repairs” and not think twice. I said I would have to think about it before I approved the work (Believe me, if I discovered the vehicle needed those repairs I would have done so). Of course I examined both and found nothing wrong, I even took my vehicle to a friend who is a mechanic and he confirmed that there was absolutely nothing wrong with either. Today 05/16/16 I again took my vehicle in for oil change, tire rotations, and also asked them to clean up the battery which had a little corrosion on the terminals, and (Also asked them to determine why my window washer reservoir was not holding fluid). The agent gave me a quote for all but the fluid reservoir, and I approved. When he called me, he said during their multi-point inspection they determined that my brake lines had “Dirty fluid” and that this would cause adverse pressure on the brake systems and cause faster wear on my pads and that they could replace my brake fluid for only $121. (Sounds very technical and expertise, right? What a line of BS! When I told my friend the mechanic he almost choked with laughter, and said how does an encased hydraulic system get dirty fluid), The service agent also said that while working on my battery that they noticed the “voltage was a little low and that they had another battery in stock and could easily replace it same day" (My battery is just over 1 year old, and works perfectly as the gauge on my console supports). Of course when I picked up my vehicle I asked the tech why during their multi-point inspection didn’t they notice a broken engine mount or timing belt today like they told me they found 6 months ago when I was last in for service? (I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT MY VEHICLE IS A 2008 WITH ONLY 67,000 MILES) I am explaining each claim with great detail because I want you the reader of this review to be prepared if you hear the same lines from them, maybe it will prevent others from paying for something that they truly do not need, like so many of people do. Please notice I didn’t mention any of the service personnel’s names. This is because I do not believe this is the fault of any one employee, but more likely the practice that plagues the entire operations of this business.< /Text>

R.I.P. Carol Anderson - May 12, 2017.
My mother died as a result of her front drivers side airbag not deploying. My parents were in a car accident they hit a tree doing 42 mph. My mother died as a result, her neck broken and lacerated heart. My fathers airbag on the passenger side did deploy hes alive and well. My parents bought a used 2011 Nissan Sentra from First Nissan. Why are all vehicles that have Takata airbags not recallled ?. Car manufacters know they defective and know Takata declared bankrupcy. They have known these airbags are defective since 2002. BEWARE of purchasing any used vehicle and go over throughly the warranty on the vehicle.  This all could be avoided if car dealerships were honest and cared about the safety of their consumers.

I could not be happier with my experience at First Nissan in Simi Valley.  I have been researching and shopping for a Murano for about a week and was drawn in to other dealerships with "no haggle" internet sites like TrueCar and Edmunds. These services have become questionable because dealers manipulate other factors once you show up, such as adding hidden fees (a $1500 maintenance fee??), and manipulating interest rates(almost 6% with a 725 credit score--huh?),  so when you show up at the dealership, the bottom line price is not the great deal you think. I drove an hour for one of those deals, and was treated like I was trying to rob the place to get them to honor the deal.  After several terrible experiences, I checked out online reviews and saw that First Nissan in Simi had great customer satisfaction rates, so I emailed them with details of the deal I wanted. Mayra sent me an email and then called me inviting me into meet with the manager. I then got a call from Billy the manager, and was blown away by his friendliness (but not in the sleazy salesman sort of way), honesty and directness.  He offered me a great deal on the phone, and even after he had be hooked, continued looking for Nissan discounts and saved me an extra $10/mth.  Who does that? Other deals would have pocketed it.  I showed up  to the dealership and their were no games or..."oh you wanted car mats with that too?"  I received an extremely fair price and was treated like a valuable customer, all in record time of like 2 hours TOTAL.  That is the way a car sale should go.  Juan was my salesman and he could not have been a nicer, more professional guy.  He completed an orientation with me of the the car and its ridiculous breadth of features. His love and pride of Nissan cars and trucks was evident.  Brian the financial manager was also super friendly as we walked through the paperwork. I never buy dealer add-ons, but actually saw great value in service that repairs tires, replaces windshield, lost keys, and dings.  He probably got me at the right time as I have recently dropped a ton on all of these.  Either way, he was also non-pressure. I really can't say enough good things about this company and its people.  If you are looking for a different, better car-buying experience , call First Nissan.< /review>

I had an outstanding, positive experience with salesman Dinesh. I appreciated the no-pressure attitude from Dinesh. I felt like I went in, knowing what I wanted, and the sales team worked to find a new vehicle I wanted that fit my budget. They made me feel at home, offered me cold water and soft drinks, and made the experience effortless and relaxed. Dinesh was a professional and he never gave me the feeling that he was rushing me to make the sale. I keep my vehicles for a long time and love Nissan's. It may be a while before I get another one but I most definitely recommend this Nissan dealership to others. It's the kind of positive experience that leaves a great memory and is the way all dealerships should treat their customers. Thank you Dinesh

< review>
I'm so glad I decided to purchase my 2010 Nissan Altima with First Nissan of Simi Valley.  I had shopped a couple other dealerships in the SCV and SFV areas and I did not get the same friendly approach like I did when I went to First Nissan.  Everyone that I came into contact with at First Nissan greeted me with a smile and made me feel important and right at home.  I need to send a BIG thanks to Sharon L. for getting the process rolling for me, as she put me at ease (buying a car can be stressful; however Sharon kept me relaxed) and a HUGE thank you goes to Kim E. as he really pulled a lot of strings for me, not to mention getting me a GREAT deal on my Altima and making the process seamless!  The finance department process was quick and painless!  I will refer all of my friends and family to First Nissan for their car buying needs.  I will also continue to buy my cars from First Nissan-They ROCK!!!! :)< /review>

<text>What can I say... I am now and officially have been a Nissan guy. Go Team Nissan for life! So last year I had bought a 2015 base model Nissan Sentra and I was happy with it because it was my first real new car and it was great but I was a little small for me considering I'm 6 feet tall but I stuck with it. So after paying the car for almost 1 year on time I decided it was time to try and trade in for a bigger car like the Nissan Maxima but it's still out of my price range for now so I went looking for an SUV. My choices were the Rogue and Marano. I went look for a base model as I knew I could not afford a better model. So I met with Glen and almost everyone knows me at the dealership because I went there all the time drooling over the maxima that will be mine one day. So long story short I was trying to get into the Rogue but I was told that I might not be able to get into it because of how upside down I was on my sentra and there was not alot of rebates. Just when my hopes where almost gone Kim who I have worked with before came up with a better option. He said I could get into a 2015 Nissan Altima SV fully loaded minus the navigation. So I looked at the altima and I fell in love with it and decided to go that route and guess what.... I GOT APPROVED AND GOT MY ALTIMA. I am so happy that I was able to get into a bigger car and feel more like it's my car. I want to thank everyone at Nissan for helping me get my car and especially Glen and Kim for doing an excellent job. Now I can't wait to get my Maxima soon but for now I'm so happy with my Altima. Thanks guys your the best and can't wait for my Maxima one day..< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1459886148001, 'text': "Andrew, thank you for writing such a great review about your experience at our dealership!

Unbelievable dealership, had an excellent experience and wouldn't deal with any other dealership. Managers Kim Ewing and Ron Giannoni took care of us and were watching out for our best interest. Sales man Matthew Zaragoza was amazing and explained everything about the 2013 Altima I was buying. Everyone involved made the experience pleasant and pain free. I've never had such an amazing and unbelievable experience buying a new car. I would encourage anyone looking to buy a Nissan to take their business to First Nissan, they are completely professional make sure they do everything in their power to take care of the customers. Jose Rivera, also took amazing care of us and ensured our Altima had full interior protection. He exceeded great service and is the only person I would deal with when it comes to service for my new Altima. If you need service of any kind for your car, make sure to see Jose because he will make sure he takes care of you.</Text>

< review>
I did a multipoint inspection check at this nissan dealership exactly before 4 weeks. This check was the most expensive one which costed me 450$ for 90k mileage. All they came back on that check is my tires are worn out. Which i can see by my own eyes.
But this is not the complaint i have.
Last week my cars timing belt was torn into individual threads (it did not just snap) which was caused by a lose tensioners. Because of which a thread from belt got wrapped around around the crank seal and the oil was leaking.
And the dealers state that the belt tensioner which was not loose until 90kmiles and got lose in those 3 weeks after i got it serviced from them which they claim to be thoroughly inspected. Now my money is wasted and i need to go to a different nissan dealer so that i can get it properly checked if there is any other surprise waiting for me in future.</review>

They were going to charge 300 dollars for a part that cost 75 dollars somewhere else, and they were going to charge 300 dollars for labor. It doesn’t take 300 dollars worth of hours to change a head light that take 15 minutes at most. If you don’t know anything about cars please get more then one estimate before you decide on a job. Do your research online as well. If you have a mechanic as a friend ask that person if you’re being ripped off. This dealership I’m sure runs off of commission so they want to rip you off so they can make more.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) First and foremost, this was the fastest process! I was planning to buy until December, but I was curious about my credit. I spoke with Barbara from the beginning she was very kind and nice, she directed me to Kim Ewing and Jesus Mendoza who were just as friendly as her. They approved me in an agreement that was honestly too hard to resist. I have an incredible car. I will definitely keep my business in Nissan first. Thank you Barbara for the assistance and Kim and Jesus for making it possible. I LOVE MY SENTRA!

Five Star Auto Care Centers on 2nd Street in San Bernardino is the worst place to ever purchase a vehicle. I purchased a used vehicle from them on May 1st 2021 told me it was good running condition with a good AC until after I paid them the cash then they said I had to bring it back on May 3rd 2021 to get a new AC unit put in and here it is May 19th and they still have my vehicle I had the car for one day they refuse to refund my $1,500 and they still have my car so I lost all the way around do not fall for their scams they do not keep their word I have the worst experience ever this is my opinion and I speak the truth<//Review>

<review>They are closing early, if you think to go around 3 or 3:30pm better not go they're closing at 4pm. I had  scheduled for new tires @9am and took about one hr. Not sure if you can schedule for oil change but if you could schedule an appt will save you waiting time.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c3534690250fdb:0xc38bb5378f3da4e1</GmapID></record>

David was very professional. The brakes on my 2003 Honda Civic Hybrid were done pretty quickly. He wrote all recommended work down for me and I will probably be back soon to get it done. We will bring the other two Honda's here as well.< /Review>

Been here twice for brake service, front and rear brakes, the guys have good customer service and are very straight forward, they'll tell you what the car needs and get your approval to change it. Did a great job with my brakes, very reasonable price.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I took my company vintage Bronco to these clowns to decipher blink codes since they claimed they could. My low mileage vintage Bronco ran fine and drove great but every time I drove it recently, the check engine light would come on. We couldn't figure it out so we dropped it off here to have them read the blink code/s. They said it was a general misfire code and that they needed to remove the intake manifold to diagnose further and would charge $99.00 to tell me why the check engine light was coming on. After their looked truck over they came up with a laundry list of items they said needed possibly addressing. General tune up, fuel filter and misc basic items. I respectfully declined, reminding the guy we only wanted the codes deciphered, as I own a heavy equipment rental company and we perform our own maintenance and most repairs in our in house auto shop. I went to pickup truck and red-flag #1, they amount they wished to charge was now $150.00 of which I protested was incorrect. After the guy made a call, he reluctantly reduced to $100.00. Red-flag#2 guy tells me his credit card machine is down so I offer to have a company check run down to him "I don't accept checks ever" was his terse reply. I asked him what he suggested then for payment? "go to an ATM and bring me cash!" I declined this offer as I do not pay cash for company expenses. He grudgingly took the credit card saying he would try to run it through..guess what..it magically worked. Red-flag #3, the guy rudely gives me my keys and says "good luck to you" I wish him good luck right back. I go to start my Bronco and it barely catches and stumbles badly. Has a huge miss like its running on 3 of 8 cylinders and a cloud of smoke is pouring out of the exhaust. I couldn't believe my eyes and was shaking I was so upset. Upon inspection, gasoline was pouring out the tailpipe as well. I went inside to complain and the guy was indignant saying that it was like that when I brought it in, even though the paperwork clearly says the opposite. These guys are crooks and shysters and by far the worst repair shop I have ever even heard of so stay away unless you want to get ripped off. I will be filing a complaint with Bureau of Automotive Repairs and suing them for any required repairs that are found by the local Ford Dealership.</review><userid>114340952979203677614</userid><username>Mr. Guydawger</username><response>None<//response>< rate>

Do not trust these guys. I went in for the $63 Groupon deal for my breaks. Thinking it was my breaks. Turns out it was master cylinder.  So they started to examine the car. Thats how they get you. They say hey come look at your car. Your breaks are good he said. Showed me and i was like cool. Then whats the problem because my car couldnt stop. He said its the master cylinder proceeded to show me and try to describe the problem. He mentiond another part that i forgot but said needed fixed aswell. Long story short he said $840 to fix. Sheesh . i was like ok put it back together and ill be on my way. I have another shop i got to on baseline and sepulveda. Jay.  When i took it to him. He said bro why did he tell you you needed that part. If that needed fixed your break would be stiff . ... Any ways he carged $175 plus warranty and my car is breaking better than ever. ... My first review and i know its alot but pls pls Do Not come here. Scammer 📢......</Review>

< Review>
Took my girlfriend's car in two days ago for just a basic oil change. The mechanic recommends all this work as well which we decline.. so she goes to hesperia for work and leaks oil everywhere.  Black smoke coming out the exhaust. Has to get it towed to the dealership. The advisor from dealer says, They never put the oil cap on it so there is oil all over her engine, they couldn't even find the cap, never changed the oil filter. The dealership kept the oil filter to show me and it was old as dirt. Call the guy up for refund and pretty much denys everything and changes the subject multiple times. Doesn't even apologize or anything. Worst place ever don't even think about taking your vehicle here.< /Review>

Worst autoshop i have ever experienced. Do not go to this place for repairs. I spent 1,000.00 dollars for parts and labor for repairs that should of lasted at least 5 years. It only lasted 5 months!  Their idea of making things right is giving them more money! Truly the worst auto repair experience i have ever had. I should of read the reviews from former customers. Stay away people, dont make the same costly mistake i did.< /review>

11/14/17 _Update to my review, a few months ago they put a lien on our vehicle, And kept it. they said they "couldn't get a hold of us" funny how my husband and I didn't receive any calls or voicemails.
If you're thinking of taking your vehicle here, DON'T. as I was reading yelp reviews I found out I was not the only one they did crooked things to!!!

It has been over a YEAR and our vehicle has still not been worked on, and it turns out that now "something else" doesn't work.... lack of communication, not professional in my point of view... they already got their money, we still don't have a working car...?!?!< /review>

I spent $3000 on a 1995 Camaro rebuild. I was told it would be a complete rebuild with 2 yr warranty and oil changes. Got the car back and IT RAN WORSE THAN WHEN I TOOK IT TO THEM!! Brought the car back several times and everytime they came up with a different reason why the motor wouldn't run right. He even tried to give me the excuse that on a Manual transmission, 1 & 2 gear were my "power gears" Took them to small claims and won the judgement, I'm still waiting for them to pay up. They got paid and I'm stuck with a unusable car. Would NOT recommend this shop to anyone!! THEY DO NOT HAVE DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT!! Go somewhere else.< /text>

SEVERAL times returned.  Paid for something promised to be able to fix..squeaky noise when backing up.  Well after new rotors/shoes/brakes problem still exist.  I will say BJ, Dave and mechanics were mostly professional BUT few hundred dollars later same squeal.  I was told by a friend metal to metal.  And what I needed are upgrade rotors (organic)not the cheap ones.</Review>

I have placed multiple orders with Morton's and the experience is excellent.  Even when I did not get one of my order's exactly correct Jenny reached out to me and assured that what I wanted was what was ordered.  Most companies would have just ordered the item and then tell you it sent you what you ordered.  I will continue to use Morton for my golfing needs, Great company and  Great personnel, thanks.< /review>

I can't say enough about this online store.  I've told everyone I golf with about them.  The products are true to what is advertised, the shipping is fast and the customer service is AMAZING!  I never shop anywhere else for my golf accessories.  Morton's is the best!<//text>

I placed 2 separate orders for some Ping irons that were missing from my sets.  Fortunately for me, there was a sale on my model so I was able to buy my brand new irons, shipped from Ping, for less than used ones on eBay!  I spoke with Jennifer at one point and she was very helpful and their service was awesome.  Very happy with my purchases from them!<//Review>

If you are looking to buy new golf equipment, start by consulting with one of the golf pros and get their expert advice! I have purchased all of my golf clubs there and have been very satisfied with the advice I received. Haggin oaks has a very large inventory of golf clubs to choose from.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x809ad99f94f1f583:0x6baa454fa9271a8e< /GmapID></record>

The reasonable prices attracted me, but what really stood out was the exceptional service.  Morton Golf Sales noticed that one of the clubs I ordered online did not match the other and asked me to clarify.  Jenny later contacted me to alert me to a delay by Ping in manufacturing what I ordered and asked whether I wanted to substitute the same club in a different color.  The clubs arrived when promised.  Good prices, excellent service, the best of both worlds.</Text>

Bought 2 doz Titleist Gran Z...just ordered 3 more doz.  Great deal. Great golf balls. Prompt shipment.

This  review was not what I submitted.  Someone edited my original review.  Besides editing in "Great deal. Great golf balls.  Prompt shipment" they edited out information I submitted about the behavior of the ball.   But I did end up buying 5 doz Gran Z balls.<//Text>

<text>I attempted to purchase a pitch and putt bag through their web site. Within minutes, I was contacted by Jenny informing me that the color I had chosen was out of stock. Jenny informed me of my remaining options and was very upfront. Although I chose to refund my order (I will re-order when back in stock), I found a very pleasant experience with Jenny's immediate outreach and information. She issued my refund immediately. I did not get the run around and I did not have to chat with a robot. Good old fashioned CUSTOMER SERVICE. I'm disappointed that I don't have the bag yet; but I am looking forward to doing business with this store in the future! Thanks, Jenny!

.... The Saga Continues...

Received an email from Jenny informing me that they received one bag in their last delivery. I re-placed my order and was told that it was in the mail the same day! Got the bag. Exactly what I wanted!

Still a 5-Star review! Many thanks, Jenny!</text>< time>

Morton Golf Sales shipped my order right away from Sacramento with Fedex.. It stayed in Tracy for several days. We first got a delivery date of Wednesday the 9th. Then we got an update that said we would get in on Saturday the 12th. It arrived on Thursday the 10th. Fedex is very unreliable right now.<//text>

I bought a golf cart and travel bag. Prices were competitive and the 20% spring discount was an added bonus. Shipping and delivery was timely. My only suggestion is to add the UPS tracking number to the email that an item was shipped so customers don’t have to ask for it. Otherwise, a very good experience.<//review>

< Review>
The people at Morton Golf have been tremendously helpful to me the past couple of weeks,  I made an online order but the item I was trying to purchase turns out was no longer available but Jennifer reached out immediately to tell me my options.  Order was placed and items shipped very quickly.  This is the kind of customer service more businesses should model.  Thanks Morton Golf!< /Review>

So grateful to everyone at Haggin Oaks super shop for helping me to purchase a new set of clubs—from the awesome club fitting with Steve Olsen to the demo club area to everyone at the sales counter They all know what good customer service is all about! I am so happy I decided to buy all my clubs here! What a difference new clubs can make, .even birdied my first hole a couple of weeks ago.  The customer service here is outstanding!! Thank you all your time and help. So happy with all my clubs!<//text>

<text>The very best online golf site I have found. I have made two large purchases, and the service has been exceptional. By far the best out there.
The only site I have found that will allow custom changes to clubs. Most give you one option, but Morton's gives a variety.

Great service and selection. If you are a Ping golfer, this is the vendor you want to check first.</Review>

<Review>Highly recommended. Great prices and great service. I bought multiple custom length Ping irons from them on different occasions and they always took the time to contact me and get the club serial number from prior purchases just to make sure everything matched correctly (all without me even asking).< /Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809ad99f94f1f583:0x6baa454fa9271a8e</gmapID></record>

Morton Golf Sales has a great selection of golf equipment.  I purchased several custom products from them and I can say (albeit corny) they put the custom in customer.  I am very happy with my experience and will continue to use them.  Morton Golf Sales is by far the best in the business.< /Text>

Ordered custom numbered Titleist Pro V1 from them a few times, always quick for a product difficult to find.  On my last order they were out of the 2014 numbers which were on sale, I received the 2015 balls for the same price with a handwritten note "Out of 2014, enjoy."

Very nice of them and will always be my guys for golf supplies.</text>

I've ordered multiple times from Morton Golf Sales and the experience is outstanding. Seannie Ceo Keeps you informed every step of the way such that there is virtually no chance or need to check on order status on your own. I was extremely surprised by how quickly orders were processed and shipped, even on a custom order. They far exceed the other online retailers. Definitely the first, and often only, place I look for my golf equipment needs.</text>

I've ordered twice from Morton's online store and the service is exceptional. Both have been custom orders from Ping (custom finish on a putter, digital lofting on a hybrid) and the staff at Morton's has helped me through the process both times.< /Text>

Great place to both browse and shop for golf equipment.  Without a doubt the most extensive inventory on the West coast and with very competitive pricing.  The service is excellent and Seannie works hard to help you in your selection and earn your trust. Also, a great club fitting experience at their Haggin Oaks complex. Purchased 2 Cobra hybrids online and a set of Callaway irons and a 3 wood after fitting by Penny Christensen within the past 45 days.  Just an overall superb experience.</text>

This is hands down the best place for your golf needs. I have worked with Seannie Ceo on online orders and she is super fast in responding and takes all orders personal and with pride. My wife ordered me a completely custom putter and when the manufacturer made some mistakes and took longer than they should Seannie was keeping me up to date and got things fixed right away. Since I live in California and shipping is super quick they have made sure to ship the same day I make an order and follow up to see if everything was good.<//review>

Online purchase of Rovic push cart went very smooth.  Am happy with the push cart and competitive price from Morton Sales.  Requested store pick up.  Within two days, Seannie Ceo from Morton sales emailed that my item was in!  I said I would be in to p/u in a couple of days.  She thoughtfully, placed it in her office for easy p/u.  The Rovic came fully assembled and ready to use.  Easy open and close.  Am very satisfied with the ease of purchase.< /review>

When in the market for golf equipment, golf consumers have thousands of options when it comes to "where to buy equipment".

-If exceptional customer service is important to you, then there is only (1) place to go...Seannie Ceo - Customer Service PROFESSIONAL @ MGS.
Seannie has EARNED all of my business especially when it comes to the legendary PING brand.  Through Seannie, PING always accommodates my custom requests and manufactures my orders to perfection.  I truly feel like (when working with Seannie @ MGS) I am the only customer she has and communicates better than any customer service professional...period.

For your next PING or other OEM order, work with Seannie at MGS...you will be happy you did!<//review>

<Text>I recently moved to the Westside and changed dental insurance which led me to find Del Dental. I had such an incredible first appointment. The dentist was kind and thorough and communicative. The office was beautiful. The front desk was organized and made my check in process so easy and quick. I really like that they use text to stay in communication before and at your appointments. I am so happy to find a new dentist that I love and cannot wait to return in 6 months! I am recommending this office to all my friends!<//Text>< pictures>

Heard a lot of great things about Dr. Fattahi despite the negative comments about bad attitude around the office. Unfortunately, Jackie at the front was the most rude individual I have ever encountered. They have lost my entire family's business for life. Do not go here< /text>

As always, the dental office was clean and well kept. Social distancing and mask regulations applied and there was seating made available.

My appointment was well timed, my visit went phenomenally well and all of my questions and concerns were answered. I think my dental-phobia has been cured all together.</text>

I was having tooth pain and no longer trusted my former (aging) dentist and needed to see someone ASAP. I was able to get an appointment the next day! From the front desk staff, to the dental assistants and the doctor, everyone was beyond wonderful! So nice, gave me great information, and we're very accommodating. I am so glad I found Del Dental Group!!< /review>

I have had a fear of dentist and dental work my whole life. Del Dental had changed my life and made a negative turn into a positive where now I look forward coming to the dentist where I used to fear it in the past. If you are considering del dental please do not hesitate, they are hands down the best dental office in LA. I drive almost and hour each way just because this is by far the best experience once can receive in the dental field.< /Text>

<review>This is by far the rudest Dentist I have ever come across, completely unprofessional. Without even addressing my dental issues, she wanted to send me for a root canal. I will say that the other two Dentists here I have seen were great and that is why I stayed with the practice. However, Dr. Fattahi has a serious attitude problem and is not thorough at all. I would not recommend anyone seeing her.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2b08adfe3a46f:0xefc191692bc629ff< /gmapID><Rating>1</Rating><response>None< /response></record>

I have been a patient for many years and I was content with the services provided. Recently I went to replace 1 front tooth veneer that was fractured and Dr. Bakke gave me a new veneer of a color that doesn't match the rest of my teeth. It took 7 appointments and many trials and errors and the final result was still off. The doctors instead of taking responsibility and fix their wrongdoing proceeded to shame me because the rest of my teeth are, in their opinion, in bad condition. I went to treat one tooth and now they suggest I change 5 teeth adjacent to the one they replaced so they can match! In the mean time they refuse to admit that the new veneer is the wrong color. All I wanted is to fix one tooth. I strongly advise against seeking treatment here. Just watch and see how they will reply  to this comment making me at fault.<//Text>

<Date>1558408117216< /Date><rate>1</rate><text>This practice is SKETCHY! I read a few reviews before going that mentioned unexpected charges and up-sells and didn’t want to believe them, but man, were they right. I had a full dental exam and cleaning here and the overall experience started off fine. The staff were friendly. The waiting area was nice. The exam room was a little dated and didn’t feel exactly as clean as it should, but it’s LA so I didn’t think much of it.

As I was leaving, I was told there would be a $100 charge for a completely unnecessary 3D scan of my mouth that was taken. This charge was not communicated to me before the scan and I was never given an option to have the scan or not. I didn’t even know what was going on when they were doing it. I questioned the charge and the woman at the desk went to talk with the owner of the practice and came back to tell me I was all set and didn’t have to pay because it was a “new procedure”. This left me a little skeptical that the charge wasn’t real in the first place.

Fast forward to a few weeks later, where I am trying to have my x rays sent to my new dentist because I had a bad feeling about this place. I had to call twice just to get the release form emailed to me, and a third time to have my x rays sent. This alone is annoying enough, but then they go on to tell me that there is a $25 charge for a copy of my records. Why am I only hearing of this after talking to someone 3 times? I spoke with the manager, who immediately waived the fee saying it was a “new process” that had begun in the two weeks since I first requested the transfer. BULLSH*T. Not to mention, whoever initially answered my phone call was incompetent enough to require me to spell my simple, 5-letter last name for her 3 times and still look up my record incorrectly. After several minutes, she was not even able to find my email because their system gets “backed up”.

In the end, I paid nothing for my visit or my record transfer but am fully convinced that this place is extremely shady. The incompetence of the staff makes me question the skill level of the dentist and hygienists, too. Stay away if you can. If they’re asking you for money unexpectedly, simply questioning the charge seems to get them to back down and “waive it”.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>**Warning: Attitude issue & maybe technical incompatibility.**
Despite waiting close to an hour WITH an appointment, I thought I found a good dental clinic for an ongoing root canal/crown issue because the clinic & Dr Fattahi said they can give me a new crown. She suggested that I re-check with an endodontist who recommended a second root canal. I felt good about the 2nd root canal, but l was not informed about the risks of a second root canal.
Dr Kim, also pleasant, took over to put a crown in place, but the temporary crown came off twice, requiring 2 separate additional office visits, although Mike is a friendly assistant.
Then the final crown came with a very flat top surface. The tooth was small to begin with, so Dr Kim shaved part of my upper tooth to accommodate for the crown on the complimentary tooth. Now the upper tooth has become overly sensitive & will need another root canal because the dentists just didn't take precaution. This is not only an additional expense, but a new issue I never had to begin with!
Besides, The local anaesthesia was very poorly administered, my jaws were hurting for over 48 hours. And food was getting stuck again In the same places as before AND the clinic completely missed a big gaping hole that needed to be filled. When I went back, Dr Fattehi showed a patronising & condescending attitude towards my pain, about filling, food sticking, inability to floss (because the filling was way too tight) & the uncovered cavity filling.
I had to change my dentist & after a couple of consultations I'm told that this office has done a really poor job of the crown!
What a mess! After my visit here, I now have a new issue that will mostly result in another root canal &!mounting expenses.
Technical issues happen, but to not take accountability & instead showing a patronising attitude towards reasonable patients is just unacceptable.< /text></record>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Super good dental hygienist!  Very fast and good at not poking anything - she does everything perfectly.  They offer an iodine rinse too which although pricey for $70 is probably a good idea and WAY better than using daily alcohol rinses that dry your mouth and saliva.  I looked up iodine mouth wash afterwards and found a USA brand you can get for a lot but it's nice to just use it on occasion (once a week) and get the full benefit of a substance that kills all bacteria and doesn't burn your mouth out.  I do take very good care of my teeth so maybe someone with bigger problems may take longer to clean but if you are like me and just go in for a super good clean this is the BEST!</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< review>
I've been to many dentists, and the ones at this office have consistently been the most skilled, most ethical, and most considerate of any I've ever met...and I've had a lot of dental work in my life! I've been a patient of Del Dental since approx 2007, so I've been with them for 10 years with no complains. I actually enjoy going there - even when I had  to have an emergency root canal on a Saturday. They made me laugh, and it was not painful. They've repaired bad dental work for me (from previous dentists), and I've had to have a few new crowns there which all feel and look great.  Most impressive: It's the only dental office I've ever visited that has front desk staff, hygienist staff, and billing staff members who've been in that office for over 10 years...and they all remember my name and smile when I'm there. There is little to no turnover of staff - which says a LOT and is extremely rare in the medical field. I'm a chiropractor, and appreciate that they can always answer my questions intelligently, and display excellent "Bedside Manner." But most important, they do extremely high quality work, and will guarantee the quality of their crowns, fillings, and work as long as you're a patient.< /review>

These guys are great! My biggest problem with visiting the dentist or doctor is they are never on time. Today they called to let me know they were running late!! To me that is being considerate of my time and I really appreciate them and that they did that. All the staff are super sweet and caring. Best dental office ever!!</review>

< Review>
They honored my appointment time, the office is nice and in a convenient location. They are very accommodating and were easy to be a patient for. The doctors were very polite and explained a little of what was going to happen with procedures. I’ve been to this office several times now and although the staff is very polite there is just a little explanation missing, I.e. why I am taking xrays sometimes, or how my insurance would charge me, expected costs before any dental work. It seems that I’m quickly processed then asked to just cough up money at the end, with no guidance of what I would be expected to pay upfront and it’s always a surprise.<//Review>

<Text>Outstanding Service - Extraordinary Experience. Everyone at the office was Highly professional, competent & cordial - Everyone. The doctor was detailed in explaining my need for dental care & provided requested information in a warm & concerned manner. All my dental questions were addressed by the doctor & all my procedural questions were answered by her assistants. Regrettably, I can't remember everyone's name but, Mary, Sylvia, one male assistant who participated during x-rays/photos, another male assistant involved with deep cleaning, a female assistant who completed paperwork and provided explanation of such, As Well As The Doctor, ALL deserve Honorable Mention...</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
After my first visit, I wrote: "Everyone is very friendly and informative, explaining every step of the process."  At that time, I was told I had a very healthy mouth and teeth.  But on my next visit later that year, I was told I needed major work (tooth extracted and replaced with an implant - a very expensive process).  I was not comfortable with that diagnosis and obtained two "second opinions" from other dentists.  Both the other dentists said an extraction and implant was not necessary.  I got a simple inlay instead and have been very happy with the work done by a different dentist.

Del Dental is fine for simple routine cleanings, etc.  However, if you go there, be wary of possible up-sells and/or unnecessary work.  I would suggest going elsewhere; I have changed to a different dentist and will not be returning to Del Dental.</review>

STAY AWAY!

I went here because of all the glowing reviews and got scammed.  I needed a chipped tooth fixed but the dentist decided that one of my crowns needed to be replaced and I was presented with two options, neither of which were covered by my insurance (unknown to me at the time) and ended up paying $650 more than I should have because they used a "name brand" ceramic crown rather than a normal one.

It was a pretty fun conversation to have the receptionist play verbal gymnastics when I asked her directly,  "Does your office have the types of crowns covered by my insurance"  only to have her keep repeating,  "The two options presented to you were not covered by your insurance".

In hindsight, it's obvious this place is a scam; most of the positive reviews are from new accounts and most of the reviews from experienced reviewers are poor.  Stay away.< /Text>

Have been clients since 2002 and still come twice yearly despite moving to Pasadena. Excellent hygienists  and Dr Fattahi is a gem of a person and an excellent clinician. Front desk is also professional and polite which is always appreciated.</Text>

<Text>This is the best dental group ever. Our family has been going to Dr. Scott for just over 40 years. An extraordinary cosmetic dentist, and a professional ethic that will make us think nothing of driving over an hour to the dentist in the Los Angeles traffic. Dr.  Vincent Scott tried to retire years ago, but none of his patients would let him leave his business entirely to someone else, although Dr. Julia Fattahi  is also wonderful and certainly learned a few things from the best of dental partners.
The dental assistants  are also warm and caring as are the office staff. We recommend this dental group to everyone!  Wherever you live in the Los Angeles area they are worth the drive to Playa Del Rey,  and besides you can always follow it up with a lovely beach side lunch at the marina !< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I’m one of those people that hates the dentist. From the dental hygienists that have cleaned my teeth to the dentist, I am so happy with the switch. Dr. Fattahi is very sweet and makes me feel very comfortable. The hygienist whose name might be Michael... was very chatty and gave me great advice. He also cleaned my Invisalign retainers.  Thanks!

Update: I got worried about some sensitivity and they scheduled be very easily for an emergency visit. Everything was smooth and they were great to look at the x:rays, tell me nothing was wrong, and give me advice for if I do feel any pain.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2b08adfe3a46f:0xefc191692bc629ff< /Gmap_id></record>

Look how short and similar the 5 star reviews are...they are writing their own reviews.  These folks have been selling us expensive work we didn't need for a decade.  We were getting suspicious in recent years.  We never had less than a half hour wait in the lobby.  We have a new dentist, suspicions confirmed: My 4 year old daughter had a filling put in by Del and our new dentist couldn't believe a filling for a cavity that minor in a baby tooth.  My wife just found out she needs a root canal under a tooth that Del put a crown on a year ago.  New dentist said the crown was an expensive and terribly done crown.  Stay away!  New dentist found 3 minor cavities in my three year old son's teeth and said, let's wait until the next visit and see...no call for fillings right now.  This is what you want, not snake oil sales people.< /text>

They do a great job and the people are fantastic!  I’ve been coming here for at least 15 years.  You won't find a better dental office.  They have all the latest technology and they’re really nice and care about you as an individual.  Great with kids, too.  You’ll get the very best cleanings and they fixed my smile with Invisalign!!  Doctors Fattahi, Bakke and Kim are the best!!  Shout out to Mike for his extra friendly, gentle, patient and caring attitude.  Thank you all.<//review>

After 35 years my dentist retired.
It’s very intimidating shopping around for a dentist. The staff is professional and friendly. I was well received and made to feel at hom and Dr Andre Bakke is wonderful and has a layed back but very professional approach. I will certainly tell my friends  about my time at this office. I now have a new dental family.< /Text>

I have frequently received dental services at Del Denta Group. Dr. Fattahi and Dr Kim have a beautiful bedside manner and a skill set that has proven time after time to address my dental needs. The front desk team and dental assistants are equally personable. I have been happy with root canals, fillings, teeth whitening, cleaning and knowledge to save my natural teeth when alternatives were slim and almost none.
Thank you Del Dental< /text>

<Review>This is an updated review. I’ve been going to the Del Dental Group for about a year and I still have nothing but positive things to say about this group. Today I went in for a cleaning and also met with Dr. Fattahi for the first time. I can confidently include her with all the other positive things I had to say about Dr. Bakke and their great staff. I sincerely love this office and how they’ve completely eliminated the fears I used to have about seeing the dentist. It’s incredible this turn around in my feelings about keeping my dentist appointments that these great people have accomplished with me. I still strongly recommend this dental office, especially if you had a fear of the dentist in the past. They are caring, friendly, and excellent at explaining every step of the way.

This was my first visit to this see Dr. Andrea Bakke. The first thing that is great about this dental office is the parking. Amazingly convenient and ample parking right behind the building. Ok, but great parking doesn’t necessarily mean great dentist, but fortunately in this case I am also giving high marks to both the dentist and her staff. All were professional, friendly and easy to talk to. Their explanations were thorough and they answered all my questions with me actually feeling relieved and positive about the plans for my future treatments. I’m pretty sure I’ve finally found a great dentist and dental office that I’ll be comfortable coming back to.

Another update, 08/19/2020. Del Dental continues to please. Went there today for my regular checkup. It was super fast. When I got to the parking lot I texted the office to let them know I arrived. Less than a few minutes I was texted back to come in. Every thing was super clean and you could tell they wanted to keep everyone’s risk at the bare minimum. Very impressed again. Not even the pandemic has lowered their standards of professionalism and care for their patients.<//Review>< pics>

<username>Johnny Tan</username><date>1481829070610< /date><rating>2<//rating><Review>I came in for a quick dental cleaning session and I had an extremely poor experience that I wouldn't bother writing a review about unless I genuinely felt cheated.

1) First ~40 minutes spent taking mandatory new x-rays by the assistant followed by the dentist coming in and trying to sell me on dental treatments

2) After refusing, the assistant comes in and spends ~10 minutes polishing my teeth before I'm told my treatment is complete

3) After driving away for 10 minutes, I receive a call telling me my cleaning was incomplete and I should reschedule another time (in mid-December) for an additional 25 minute cleaning.

None of this is professional and I especially do not like the fact that I was pitched to 4X longer than my cleaning treatment - the primary reason why I came in the first place. I give 2 stars because at least they called as I drove away to admit that they messed my treatment up.</Review>< pics>

<review>My husband went in for a crown under our insurance. They wouldn't give him a crown that was covered for under $300. They insisted that we pay $850 for a special crown. When he said he didn't want to do that, and wanted to discuss it first, they showed him the door.

We'll be finding a different dentist.< /review>< rate>

Your insurance doesn't cover your crown. You have to pay us now 1500 dollars immediately.That is what they told me with a very very friendly face. They just try to rip you off.

<text>What an amazing Dental Office! As soon as my paperwork was completed, was taken in for my cleaning and xrays. Both of my boys were also seen, and my youngest who is terrified of the dentist/doctors didn't shed a tear. The entire staff was ki,d and knowledgeable and didn't try to "sell" us anythi,g above and beyond what our i,sudan's cost. By far this has been the best dentist I have seen, ever.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

My family and I went shopping for Christmas gifts today. We were there at least a couple of hours. We had some very helpful employees, but the one that really stood out was the cashier, who we will call her "K". K was exceptional. She was courteous, helpful, and very patient; which is unfortunately very rare in customer service anymore.< /Text>

One of the many perks I enjoy as a retiree are my Exchange privileges. The tax-free shopping, the great assortment of products, price matching, and multiple lanes for a quick checkout is a major plus. You're bound to find a great discount if you're a bargain shopper. 20-50% off in some of the clearance sections of clothing and shoe deals. Another plus the MCX just added was the Gap brand! Happy shopping!<//text>

I don't normal shop at the MCX on Pendleton, but the excellent level of customer service I received from Ms Adeline in jewelry was top notch.
She was knowledgeable, attentive and kind.
It's just about Christmas time and the lines moved quickly. They have a good traffic flow, we were able to socially distance, hand sanitizer was available. It was a good day at the MCX!<//Review>

I still don't understand why this Nation's Fighting Men and Women have 1 place to go for their and their families needs and everything is overpriced and not discounted. Our Service Men and Women deserve much more.<//review>

Coming from 29 Palms after living on base  for 13 years, I was told that the Camp Pendleton location was the biggest store they offer on a Marine Corps base. After shopping there several times, I realised 29 Palms though it may be smaller, has Camp Pendleton MCX beat by MILES. I can never find ANY shoes my size at Pendleton location. Their selection of clothing isn't the best either in my opinion. I don't want to live in 29 Palms again, but I sure wish I could have their MCX back!!< /text>

A wide and great selection of name and off brand items. Groceries are limited (commissary is next door though). Plenty of electronics, kitchen supplies, clothes, military apparel and uniforms, a garden/outdoors center, recreation and exercise department, a nice tailor shop and cheap but fast haircut center. Also has a dukin donuts and a frozen yogurt place. It's got it all, would recommend a visit.<//review>

Camp Pendleton main PX isn't great. I can't find any clothing there except underpants. I love Brighton handbags, those aren't being restocked.  I drive to Miramar PX and can always find clothing, and too many other things as well.</Text>

<text>I have mixed feelings about this place. Sometimes the employees are nice to you and sometimes they're just rude and not helpful at all. Depends on who are working that day I guess. Overall, it's a good place to shop since everything is cheaper and it's tax-free.<//text>< Pics>

If you have base access, I strongly recommend shopping at the MCX. Prices are usually pretty competitive and you don’t have to pay taxes on anything in the store. Every penny spent at any MCX goes right back into the military community where you’re buying from. For instance, if you buy items here, the revenue generated goes back into MCX and Camp Pendleton<//review>

<review>I am so very disappointed. I took my fam ily to the base to relive some glory days. What did I see walking in front of me. A senior member of the Corps walking in the PX with PT gear on, you can tell this ninja just came from the gym. He walks by a Major, a freaking commissioned Officer! Nothing was said. I had to yell "so we don't correct people and maintain good order and discipline!" Nothing. We walked in right there a sign just like it was 8 years ago when I was active. "Still said No Freaking PT Gear!" I went out of my way to dress my family unit accordingly. Y'all should also.</review>< pictures>

It is a great place to shop if you don't mind that half the items on the shelves are not priced or priced correctly. My last visit some candles priced at 11.99 and a sign that says 25% off so the cost should be 8.99 but when you get to the register was told that the price was 15.99 and discounted to 11.99.  Same item out in town 12.50 each buy two get two free.  The other  great thing is the customer service.  There is a sign for the registers to start the line and wait for the next cashier that is open.  Standing there and notice that they are not using that sign so just get in a line at an open register.  At the "CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK" the women finishes with the customer in front of me and I start to place the items on the counter when she looks at me and as she starts to walk away and says oh this register is closed.<//review>

I love that it was set up the same pretty much as the base in 29 Palms so I knew where everything was at and all the workers are very very nice.

Used to be a good place to shop in the early 2000's now places out in town are way cheaper than on base.  Shop out in town and save money.<//text>

It was standard good. We brought our things without waiting but it was on a sunday... and since it was our first visit there, I'm not sure if it was less busy then on a regular work week. The employees there are really nice and help us with our purchase.</Review>

I went looking for something new for spring. Found nothing. Clothes looked terrible. I usely find lots of nice things this time of year. The exchange needs a new buyer. Just pick up some Valentine's candy for gift & a new blender. Nothing else. And I was in tbe mood to buy.
I will be back for Mother's day. Just to check out merchandise. I hope to C new stuff for spring or summer by then.</review>

Not always fully stocked but fastest service and largest variety as far as MCXs on base. It's more civilian based than the other MCXs but you'll usually find what you need regardless. Always great customer service. Recommend going in the beginning of the week to avoid hectic, highflow hours.</text>

The worst MCX! Come between the hours of 8am-8pm to find a store with 2 open registers and a line that wraps around the store. But if your looking for something in particular you will find it in the food iles! Only plus is grabbing a protien bar and realizing that you forgot you needed some motto stickers and the message to garcia final edition<//text>

< Review>
NEVER USE THIS ALTERATION SHOP! just go to "dorthys" right outside the main gate. I gave then a blues coat to get new chevrons. That's it, no alterations, no dry cleaning. They had my jacket for almost a month.  But waited untill the day I was supposed to pick it up to stitch it on that morning. Just go elsewhere and save yourself the hassle.< /Review>

As always treated with respect and courtesy! 1 small request, please make a centralized location where some of retirees can go and buy some of our old unit gear.  Some of us arent authorized into our old work spaces and are proud to have served with some of these units, and proudly want to display their Unit Pride!!  Not a complaint, just a suggestion.<//review>

Sheila and Maryana, at the MCX are excellent professional employees. Sheila the checker and Maryana, who helped get my price check done were great. They deserve recognition for excellent customer service. I truly appreciate all they did.</Review>

This is a good size exchange on Camp Pendleton and has a usual good deals on electronics and some clothing and Jewelry. The best thing is the tax-free status for those that can shop there.< /Review>

The onky issue I saw was the checkout line was to the back of the store and it only looked like 1 or 2 registers open. If that is the case there is a register by the GNC store as you go out of the door. This register is for uniform only Mon-Fri, however on the weekends it's fair game and not a lot of people in the other line know.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dc6f97bc45321f:0xbd8ad9782239694<//Gmap_id></record>

<text>I like that I can shop for items and pay less that I would've paid at a department store in a mall. No charge for bag with your purchase and no high taxes on your purchases. The exchange sells brand name clothing for men women and children, shoes, purses, electronics, jewelry, cosmetics and more.<//text>< Pictures>

Good for browsing around but items are all over priced. There's a commissary across the street that sells some of the same things for two to three dollars cheaper.< /review>

Horrible experience with this store and their return policy ! My SO got me a pair of boots 3days ago so upon trying them on , noticed a stain that’s prolly they put it in markdown to $86 and unfortunately don’t fit me that well. Went to return today , our floor isn’t carpet and my mistake that didn’t wipe the bottom of it when I tried them on just put straight back to its box.  So told them I tried them on and they keep insisting that it has been worn and disregard my issue. We will never shop in this store again. Their manager and employees has no consideration.< /Text>

When I'm in uniform, and during work hours, there is a registered that is reserved for us. This is fantastic for Marines who on a short time table and have to be back to work quickly especially during holidays when its packed with civilian shoppers.</Text>
