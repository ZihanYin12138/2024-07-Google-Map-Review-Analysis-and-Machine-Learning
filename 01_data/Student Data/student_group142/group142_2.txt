<Review>Sally is the best! I have been in Temecula for 3 years and been to basically every nail salon in town. So happy I finally found Sally!<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_s87lIc2OIIDtFVU41-5lEZYQRb4LdUAKNMEb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkSEy8higVsb4dh3tvM7ff_EYnrYYuQWeEJh_6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_TML1KBnsCWp40oc9lBxCMh4iuZysJd46NedG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< response>

Sally's Nail Spa is beyond amazing. It's so beautiful inside and the owner, Sally, is very talented and so sweet. I was in a pinch and could only get my nails done on Sunday but unfortunately many nail salons were closed because of the pandemic and lack of business to keep workers employed. I spoke with Sally over the phone who was able to accommodate me that same day and within the hour, and she came into the salon to do my nails! I brought in my neice to get her nails done too, and she even helped out another customer who happened to be in the area after she finished with us. If you are looking for a clean place with talented and nice individuals, this is the place to come. It's a wonderful thing to be able to support our local businesses, especially during a time of need.<//text>

If not for the cashier always trying to get me to pay in cash, I'd recommend this place as my girls enjoy it. The ladies are friendly and do a great job. It's the check out process that kills it. I understand the card transaction fee for the shop but the guy takes it as insult when I don't have cash with me. Sorry, can't keep every dime off the books...<//Review>

Really nice place to get what you need done. I love how gentle they are with my mother and how attentive they are to the customers. They were really busy when we went but they made two happy customers out of us. Will be going back for fills and pedicures again.</Text>

<review>Sally’s Nail Spa is the place to go if you want quality service, quality nails, and a quality salon. I love the new dipping powder. I went from getting my nails done 2x a month to once a month.... that’s how good the dipping powder is and their technique is excellent. You can always count on great nails because they all do it the same way. Sally is a great owner too, she always finds a way to get you in at a time that’s convenient for you. I LOVE that with my busy schedule.<//review>< username>

<pics>None</pics><Review>I was looking for a place on yelp and I came across Sally’s. In the photos I saw people talking about nail dipping powder, which was new to me so I googled it. It looked really cool so I decided to make an appointment.

I arrived to the Nail Salon with an appointment and they were super friendly and greeted me. The salon is decorated super cute and was full of people. Sally did my nails with the dipping powder, she even recommended the most beautiful color. I love how they turned out!!

But I was most impressed with the atmosphere. Sally was so kind and talk with me, got to know me as she did my nails. I learned that she has been doing nails for 25 years! I was most impressed that as the owner not only did she do a great job at my nails, but also running the salon. Every single customer that walked in or out talked with her, and she knew all their names! Sally not only took great care of my names, but she works hard on the details of caring for her customers. I will be back again for sure!< /Review><username>Brooke Nagel<//username><Gmap_id>0x80db7f57e088c50f:0x45cb6bee27edf229<//Gmap_id>< response>

<Text>I love this location! It’s always so relaxing when I come in to get my nails. The nail artists are very kind and patient. The variety of designs they have are the best I’ve seen around town. Sally, the owner is always very helpful, especially when I accidentally chip my nail before even leaving the salon. I’m terrible about that and she never minds touching up.

<text>Unsatisfying experience. The staff did not greet my friend and I upon arrival. As a walk in, my friend requested to get her acrylic nails removed. As a removal procedure, the nail tech took cuticle cutter to pry and rip off the acrylic. The entire experience looked completely painful and the nail tech did not communicate at all during the service. Her nails were cut to the nub, not by preference; again the nail tech did not communicate as to what length she wanted. After writing a review, the owner called from a personal number to ask if we could remove the one-star review. I don’t believe it is appropriate for a business to call a customer in request of removing a bad review. The owner did not explain as to why they used the technique they did for this service, but rather blamed my friend for not speaking up. It is not the customers job to tell the nail tech how to do her job; resulting in why she did not say anything. A review is meant for improvement, not criticism. If a business receives a bad review from a customer, they should act upon it and use it to improve their services, not call an underaged customer to tell them they need to remove a bad review.< /text>< pictures>

This is by far the best nail salon I have ever been to! The staff are always so welcoming and friendly. There are a hundreds of colors to choose from. Sally does an amazing job. I have brittle nails and thanks to her my nails have never been longer or stronger. The dipping powder has changed my life. I trulylook forward to my appointments here. I wish I could give more stars.< /Text>

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER - I had 6pm appointments for my boyfriend and myself.  While my services were moving along at 7pm (closing time) my boyfriend was sitting in the spa chair and the lady doing his pedicure started packing up to leave.  I had asked 2 different people what about his manicure and I was told everyone is going home.... I couldn't believe it!  So then I'm telling the owner lady who is very apologetic and telling me she didnt know....??? Really??  No communication that there is an unfinished customer waiting for services??  More irritating she kept asking ME what she should do to the employee the next day??? So I paid for ALL of our services and we left, my services complete and his incomplete and IF I ever go back its only because my nail lady of 10 years is there.  I will definitely go elsewhere for ALL other services. Not Speaking very good English is NO EXCUSE... you should not have a business here then.<//review>

Switched up from my normal salon and I was not let down at all! Sally did such an amazing job! I went in looking to leave with a complicated ombré acrylic powder design and she went above and beyond! Definitely recommend and leaving my old salon for hers!< /text>

I’m so thankful for sally, I know I’m one picky client and sometimes hard to please. But since I started getting my nails dipped by sally, I’ve been so happy! Thank you sally 💛<//review>

I visited this salon with a friend of mine to get a gel pedicure. I witnessed Sally yell at 2 different customers and a snap on an employee - and I was  there for less than 5 mins!!! Needless to say I left immediately, without receiving a service. I will not be returning to this place. Excellent decor should not take the place of excellent customer service!!<//review>

<name>Brier Allen< /name><date>1537660545069< /date><rating>1</rating><Review>Hello hunnies, the reason I give Sally’s this rating is I am extremely disappointed in both my experiences. For the first, my friend and I made an appointment, which they still had us waiting a solid 30 minutes for before we began. Now I may sound like an average bitching Temeculan woman, but I have a newborn son and every moment counts when I am away from him! My poor husband can only handle so much screaming and fussing. But he likes to treat me and for me to enjoy myself. Suffice it to say, he makes a sacrifice for me to have a nice time, so it’s disappointing for both of us when I don’t. But I got Vanessa, and she’s bomb. Okay so time #2, I requested a certain photo, of which my stylist completely ignored, along with my request for a silk wrap, proceeding with gel instead. Okay, I thought, some gel polish would be alright I suppose. Well me being me, didn’t speak up (I felt bad and didn’t want her to feel like she was doing a bad job) and after all was said and done, she charged me $45! I wish you could see this clumpy, uneven, not fully dried, polish-on-my-fingers mess. And mind you this woman moved like molasses in a Russian winter. I honestly just felt bad that my husband paid for me to have a good time and look nice and I came out with nails looking like some stubby cottage cheese or somethin ☹️ So that’s my spiel lol thank you for reading!!!<//Review>< Pictures>

Tried this nail salon for the first time yesterday because it had good reviews. Went in for a regular pedicure and managed to get up sold on $7 extra for the pumice which I’ve always had included in pedcures. Bottom of my food got cut from the pumice because it was done too rough. Then while cutting my cuticles she cut my large toe in the corner of nail and it’s been bleeding since yesterday. I’ve had a bandaid on it to try to stop the bleeding and it’s very sore. I could have done a better job doing it myself. Not happy after spending $27 on this pedicure.<//Review>

My fiance had her nails done here for our wedding and was happy with the job done. However her sister had her nails filed down way too much as the technician doing her nails was busy talking with a friend and was a bit distracted.</Text>

<text>Worst experience ever the lady who did my nails cut me so many times and then one of the times she tried to blame me and said I moved. She also shaped my nails very crooked, they’re all uneven and they’re lumpy as well she kept saying because it was cold it made the acrylic stuff too liquidy. Then she was using an expensive base coat on me and the owner walked over and yelled at her and made her use a cheap one on me. It was also very overpriced I was only supposed to pay about $35 and when the lady finished she made me show the owner and she told her to charge me $47 all I got was acrylic nails with a gel nail polish and I got them long and coffin shaped with no design. 2 days later one of my nails started to crack. I think the staff if all really rude too my sister got her nails done as well and the lady she got was really rude to and her nails were even more simple than mine and they charged her $40. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

< Review>
No idea why this place has such good reviews. The staff are very friendly, I think that's about all this location has going for it. Otherwise it's kind of a dump.

Rain leaks damaged property in my unit and water collects on the floors and hallways. Homeless sleep in their units and in cars on the property. Elevators are consistently broken. You always have to get staff to unchain carts because the homeless will steal them otherwise. Pre-Covid, you had to leave your ID to get a cart and the office worker disappeared for the day, forcing me to come back another day to get my driver's license.<//Review>

I had to move and need a quick place to store items. I live near fashion district and this is closes to me, the location could be better because of homeless. The staff is super friendly, Cynthia made me feel at ease putting my things in this storage. She helped me find the perfect size for my things on such short notice and gave me half of to help for the first month. Place is clean on the inside and it's pretty big, a lot of moving trucks fit inside the parking lot. Cynthia even suggested a great place to eat near by, she's such a sweetheart and I love her name..lol</text>

The customer service was poor .

My storage was broke into I believe this was management master key insurance cannot recover my belongings I will be taking this matter to court !

My parents are not here I had things I can’t never get back from the heartbreak of memories I’m very disappointed is this matter.

Ps:When I told the workers my storage was broke into they continue they’re conversation on the phone like I was invincible very rude!</text>

<text>I don't need a space until January but I wanted to know the price of storage. Cynthia took the time to show me two spaces and she knows her stuff about storage. She made me feel that this place is best because they have $1 for a month and the security is great. Cynthia made me feel like my things are going to be safe here. I am renting here<//text>< Pics>

Jasmine was so polite and helpful. This was our first storage and we weren't really too sure how to go about it. She made the process so smooth for us. Definitely would recommend this location.< /Review>

<text>Wow. What can I say? Stefany was on loan to this facility for a day and was instrumental and making my move in smooth and simple. She had a great smile, good energy and was not  with all the attitude. So grateful to her. Hope I don't have to follow her to her main location to get this high level of customer service.  Well, we will wait and see.

Great space, great price, excellent service. Cynthia helped me, showed me the space and made all the best recommendations for packing. She is the absolute best! I would give her 10 stars if I could. She has given me peace of mind in this process and made me feel very secure. She was courteous, professional, honest and highly efficient. Thank you, Cynthia and Public Storage!< /review>

I needed a closer location to my city and they were quick in providing information and helping me to get everything done with a smile. Great crew.

The Public Storage team at this facility is so kind and helpful with finding your every need! This was my families first time looking for storage and we were happy to be assisted by Jared and Cynthia. My experience was a 5/5 thanks to their great customer service, however, I am only deducting 1 star due to the current technical issues regarding their elevators. Thankfully the team assured me it was a minor issue and we were able to store without any hassle! Thanks again, Jared and Cynthia!< /Review>

Outstanding customer service! I highly recommend this place. All my questions were answered in the best way possible and that was all thanks to Francisco and the bushy hair guy who's name I can't spell. Francisco service was so amazing I have to give him a review. I walked in and he greeted me with a warm smile and greeting. Come to this place and ask for Francsico and the bushy hair guy you won't regret it.</Text>

<Text>The service at this public storage is great, Cynthia, Carla and Francisco are always really helpful and friendly. All the staff is really good at answering all your questions and they do so in an amiable manner. The area is really convenient for me and they have several unit sizes from which you can chose. I rented two units and so far no problems for me. I highly recommend this location for all your storage needs.< /Text>< GmapID>

I am moving out and went to go ask about pricing at this location . Cynthia not only showed me the perfect size for all of my stuff but she offered the space with a 50% off discount and with the money I saved I was able to buy the bags she recommended to keep my bed safe. Cynthia is very friendly and this company needs to give her a raise.< /Review>

Hi! I stop by earlier today to window shop and the employees there Francisco and Susana were incredible! They showed me around and make sure I was fully informed. The only reason I didn't rented was because I ain't moving from my place until two month from now and I have found my place to store my things. Thank you Public Storage!< /text>

<Date>1503557550165< /Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I walked in earlier this afternoon to the facility in San Pedro with a friend looking for a unit to rent out. I'm not from LA so I was skeptical on what I could find to hold my things for a reasonable price.  We were promptly addressed by a woman named Carla at the counter. She was genuine in her greeting and insisted that had there been any questions that arose that we not hesitate to ask. We had been to other facilities but seeing as this was a pretty big store we had asked if we could take a look at one of the units, hence I wasn't too sure if I was ready to rent one at this facility or even rent a unit at all. Carla was able to relate to us on a personal level and kept her explanations short and to the point. Since I'm from Alaska, I was planning on transitioning over to LA but wanted to make sure I had everything in check for myself. I also was a bit worried with what I need such as extra boxes. Carla reassured me that they happen to have boxes at a decent price as well if I happened to run into trouble needing things to make the haul of the load somewhat better. Carla was very knowledgeable, respectable, helpful, kind, genuine, and not to mention hilarious. Not only did she have us to deal with but all the while busy with answering phone calls and other customers in such a professional manner. I was highly impressed with her talent for multitasking at such a quick pace, ( A comment my friend also mentioned to me) Her customer service was pure excellence. It's very rare to find great customer service like hers where everything just flows naturally. When we were finished with our visit Carla walked us out the store with such a warm smile and ended the day with mentioning how their doors would always be open to us if there were anymore questions or interests. Thanks to Carla and her wonderful service, she's made my decision on moving to LA a quick and easy one especially on where to rent out a space and given me the influence to constantly return to the facility and to share it with many other people. Thanks Carla so much, you're awesome :)<//Review>< Pictures>

Cynthia is amazing with customer service. I want to rent a space and even though the prices are a bit high for me and unfortunately I’m not renting her service was so amazing I have to give her a review. In a few months I’ll be moving and just asking around for prices. From the moment I walked it she greeted me with a warm smile and kept it the whole time. I really appreciate the attention she gave me and how much she knew about the renting business. She answered every question I had and I just might return to rent with her even though prices are a bit high. Thanks Cynthia you’re amazing.< /review>

I walked into the store on San Pedro and was immediately greeted by Paul the property manager. What drew me to this store was the amazing reviews I read on google. So I went to inquire on spaces at this location because I'm moving to the downtown area and found out that right now is not a great time to rent due to high prices and no promos. But due to the amazing customer service that Paul provide by giving me a great tour of the property and answering all my questions. I will be storing here soon sometime this year thanks Paul we need more people like you.<//Review>

I am definitely coming back to get a storage and with this type of customer service I will make sure to tell my friends and family that need a storage. The way Susana took it beyond hopefully management is looking at this and give her a raise plus a pat in the back as we need more people this responsibility,respectful, and enthusiastic</review>< Pics>

Sandra provided excellent customer service while trying to get a storage space. She let me view the space even before I finalized anything to make sure I was pleased.
Romeo was also very helpful. He made sure we were taken care of and feel comfortable with leaving our space there.</Review>

Hell there are like five elevators and you have to enter a code. This would be a good place to store stuff if you want to start an Internet business. One time I left my door unlocked and they called me. In fact, they freaked out and put ropes all around my storage door. They are kind of stupid sometimes but it is pretty nice space. You may want to buy a lantern to put in your space because they don't have a light in your actual storage area. In fact the whole place is fairly dark. However the spaces are clean, well maintained and decently priced........etc.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

The service is far beyond expectation. Francisco has been extremely helpful and he makes it so much easier for me to move in to my storage. He gives the best service and I am so happy that I choose Public Storage.< /review>

<review>Be very very CAREFUL.  Receptionist lies and WILL CHEAT YOU.  Signed up online.  Made to come in a week early for an 'INTERVIEW'.. a scam to shorten your term.  Started moving in on our date pre-booked online and found space was too small.  Public Storage staff said they could not change space, had to cancel online $1 for first month special and charged a LOADED rate.  DID NOT HONOR online rate.  LIARS AND CHEATS.  $5K MAX items in storage - OK if you are HOMELESS!

Staff LIE and CHEAT.  Predatory practices.  I WOULD NOT trust the staff at THIS FACILITY.</review>< Time>

I have been a tenant for 8 years and Paul Ramirez the property manager has shown what a real manger can do as far as helping tenants. He went out of his way to refund my auto pay so I can pay a prorated amount. I appreciate all he has done for me here, and enjoyed my stay here I recommend anyone to rent if Paul Ramirez is the Manager< /Text>

< Review>
I went in looking for a good and clean place, and that's exactly what I found. Carla help me and answered all the questions I had, she gave me great customer service.  I highly recommend this place.

I am very happy with the continued amazing service. Everytime I go in to pay my storage; I always see the same friendly faces. I feel at home, because Carla greets me everytime with a friendly smile and she remembers my name. I’m happy I chose this storage facility.<//Review>

< Review>
I have been a tenant for 8 years and Paul Ramirez the property manager has shown what a real manger can do as far as helping tenants. He went out of his way to refund my auto pay so I can pay a prorated amount. I appreciate all he has done for me here, and enjoyed my stay here I recommend anyone to rent if Paul Ramirez is the Manager<//Review>

5 stars for Frances and Carla who checked me in today.  Carla helped me by phone with my questions.  I had stored at another location three years ago, so there was some doubt as to whether I can still qualify for the $1 first-month new-customer promotion.  Frances called some PS number to verify my eligibility and the answer was Yes!  Thanks ladies.< /Text>

I want to express that services at public storage are amazing and that cythnia was the first person to help me out. She was very polite and helpful and she kept me wanting to come back. I want to say that the customer service at the san Pedro location is amazing. As i came back to rent on 11/16/2016 Paul the property manager assisted me in opening my account and knowledgeable and great in helping find the best deal possible. Thanks Paul for all your help.< /Review>

<Review>Breaking locks and getting your stuff stolen and them not doing anything about it isn't right, no cameras around the units just the office. Homeless people are being more useful than the actual employees. This place is cheap for a reason.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Cynthia was such a sweetheart, it's rare to see someone smiling at work. She explained the pricing and units to me like the pro that she is. I was shocked to find out she's only been at this location for such a short time. This location is going to thrive with her here.</Text>

<Review>STOLEN TV & MACBOOK - 100% an Inside job!!!!!

Beware this property is stealing from its customers. In 10 days both my smart TV & hidden MacBook Air was stolen. Thankfully they were kind enough to leave me at least 1 TV (The smallest 1 out of the 2), how commendable.

March 9th, I arrived to reserve a unit, was recommended storage unit B-12 (1st floor) for the size I was seeking (10x20) by the employee handling my reservation. While inspecting the unit she pointed out issues with the wall and promised that maintenance would resolve that issue and the unit on the other side was vacant. She stressed that my unit would not need to be accessed at all and continued to clarify that my items would be safe and the property has cameras. Trusting her word and the name of public storage I went through with it, big mistake.

March 19th, upon opening my storage unit I immediately notice 1 of my TV’s are missing. I didn’t want to jump to conclusions so I investigated doing my best to leave as is. After be 90% confident by Tv is gone I visit the office to let them know the situation and was eventually met with the property manger who pretty much had nothing of value to say other than “That’s bizarre *head scratch*” he then told me I would have to file a police report and claim with insurance. Not till then I was informed there are NO cameras in this building and on the first floor. How convenient!

Upon moving my items out it became apparent my unit was accessed via the “vacant” neighboring unit, hence the wall structure, and steps on my mattress which were propped next to the “hole”. Then to make matters worse there is a hole the size of a closed fist that was covered with TAPE on the “vacant” unit side.

UNSAFE unprofessional  property overall. I will never use public storage again or recommend to anyone no matter the price. I would rather pay a high amount for 10days of secure storage then step foot on that property again.<//Review>< Rate>

Expect to see panhandlers and other shady looking characters outside this location.  It is gated but there's nothing appealing about it. It lacks proper maintenance of the grounds and a lot of foot traffic come in and out of here considering it is a storage and one would expect it to be very quite. Staff is rude. It sits along side the 110 fwy on a very busy street. Good luck!</Review>

Honestly not sure how this place almost has 5 stars. The facility is literally garbage. Elevators don't work, extremely dirty buildings, and dust AND paint will get over everything you store there. The service staff (only one person) is usually not friendly. Avoid.<//Text>

I went to public storage near downtown on san pedro street where i was greeted by Paul the property manager he showed me a few spaces and was so professional and knowledgeable at what he does, although I didnt rent a space at his location due to the prices being kinda expensive during this time of the year. He did tell about other locations which met my target price and i will go there to rent. Im writing this review to show how valuable this individual is at public storage and knows what customer service is all about.<//text>

<review>This Guy Romeo forced his customers like a crying baby to write review in his favours. He almost didnt let me go home until he forced me to write a good review in his favour. Romeo stood on my head and tried to dictate me what to write and as soon as I finished he didnt even say thanks. Plus he tried to sell me stuff I didnt even need but Romeo persisted that I should buy boxes and packing supplies even though I really had nothing to pack. This guy is a rip off</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

I like the customer service. I would not change it. I like how the work inviroment and how the way they handle the customers and even if there is a conflict they are professional about it. They are really convinient and always notifie us about everyhting. Edith, patty, romeo are really great would not change this place and the price is great. The only thing is they need a little more carts.<//text>

System has been down for weeks which has the elevator and front gate system out of service. Really is that hard to get and keep this place cleaned up. This place has gone down more so, then what it already was.< /Review>

The manager romeo he did such a great heart for the customer
He was working so hard to find perfect place to put my things
And has loving heart, I was so impressed
I stingy recommend this place and romeo

Move your luggage, move and move things.
I was impressed by the manager Romeo and the warm heart and service.
We are grateful and highly recommended for our honesty and sincerity.

<Review>Planing to move soon I got a jump on it and pack to store several items that turned into multiple boxes and unused furniture. I called various storage companies to compare availability with and costs for a 5x10 unit. I found that SAMS was the most reasonable and offered a promo price for the first month. I met the manager who walked me to the specific unit to look for myself. She explained the policies and procedures for entering and leaving. The unity was clean and easy to access. The manager was efficient and very nice to do business with. I like the ability to pay the monthly fee through auto deductions from my bank so I don't have to worry about making the payment on time.   I feel my possessions  are safe and in good hands.< /Review><GmapID>0x8084ab7f1b2e4daf:0x2f0954f0c3b9df4a<//GmapID><Time>1598650247634<//Time><Response>{'time': 1598892318880, 'text': 'Thank you so much for the stars and the nice review.

<Text>What an amazing experience I had!
This was my first time renting a space for my travel trailer.  I didn't know what I needed or what to ask for.  Luckily for me, Mary was there to guide me.
Mary was thorough and patient, she was efficient and walked me through the whole process.
I feel confident that my trailer will be safe and I highly recommend anyone who has storage needs to reach out to Mary, she's a breath of fresh air!<//Text>< Pictures>

I have been renting with Stow Away Mini Storage for a few years and the service is wonderful! The staff are super nice and go the extra mile to even remind you about your storage payment in the form of a courtesy call a few days before it’s due, I love this since I never forget to make my payment! This is a great place to rent! !</Review>

After searching, I found Stow Away Mini Storage to be the cheapest, most convenient, and most secure place to store my things. After going into the office, and looking at the property, I was convinced this was a good choice. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I love that there is someone there 24 hrs a day to provide security for my unit. Best choice in a storage facility I have ever chosen!<//Review>

< Review>
The whole experience was seamless, after making my reservation online I got a confirmation call from the office to verify my unit would be ready for me. When I arrived. Mary at the office was Awesome, she first let me view my unit to make sure it was the size that would best meet my needs. I ended up going one size bigger and I appreciate that she took the time to make sure I got what I needed. Thanks again Mary for such great customer service.</Review>

We have stored our trailer at Stow Away for about 10 years. It is a great place and I would have given them five stars but the new entry gate is challenging since we block George Washington while accessing the facility. The staff is very helpful and I really like the e-mails I receive.<//text>

I am a new customer @stowaway mini storage.
I was impressed with Mary the manager. She helped me over the phone & when I came in to see the unit, the process was quick. I recieved a free lock, upon my purchase, which was very convenient & awesome. I love free! 😁  My unit was clean.. the grounds are clean.. the prices are better than, other places here in Yuba City!
Mary is a friendly professional & is awesome help whenever u need it. Thank you.<//review>

I would like to say how pleasant Mary was from the first time I meet her on the phone to going in and doing the paper work for my storage unit.
I have found that the units are kept very clean and the grounds also.
I like the added Balloons by the gate really helps locate the drive way, on the busy road.
Thank you Mary for all your help you are the best:)</text>

<review>I first started with Stow Away Mini Storage last year in January 2018.  At that time I've had to rent one unit, then months later a second unit.  Moved out, only to return yet again and now have three units.  Through all my confusing moving around, Manager Mary Damore has been fantastic, always coming up the the right size at a very reasonable price.  The grounds are always clean, the units I've rented convenient, and it's been a pleasure doing business with Mary Damore.  Thank you!< /review>< pictures>

I am well pleased with new management. It definitely an upgrade since Mary Damore became a team member. She has put a new meaning to professionalism .I've had nothing but satisfied results in all aspects of this establishment.<//review>

I have never had the luck two of your reviews have had. makes me wonder what really happened. I have been a renter for a long time now with no problem. everyone is nice, everything is clean & well taken care of. I am just wondering if the not so lucky people think they are above everyone else. the people that work there are very nice. I could not see them mistreat anyone. I have seen people come when I have been there & try to bully them to get there way. even if you do not get your way go to  where you do last I checked it was still a free country.<//Text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>I don't know about prices of rental spaces at Stow-Away Mini Storage, but I sure know about the policies.  I went to look at a trailer that was for sale by one of the renters.  The office was closed, but someone was coming out of the building.  When I tried to ask questions, the woman in charge bit my head off.  She yelled that they were closed and I couldn't see any trailer without the tenant being present.  I thought that was a reasonable policy.  However, there was no need to treat me or my 78 year partner like we were criminals.  I have never in my adult life been so vehemently chastised by a person in a customer service position.  The entire conversation should have been done without rancor or anger.  I did not respond in kind to her acidic tone.  I would recommend a course in customer relations and anger management.</Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x8084ab7f1b2e4daf:0x2f0954f0c3b9df4a<//gmapID></record>

<Review>Okay so for the last few trips I've been missing out...  Been going to the fancy name brand shop down the road...   A coworker suggested this place...  Let me tell you, it is an absolutely life changing experience their Cookie Monster in a sprinkle chocolate dipped bowl will help you find life's meaning.
I'm mildly lactose intolerant and this is worth every minute of punishment i may have to endure.  This is among one of the reasons I can't move to San Diego...  I'd be full on diabetic in a month.   Definitely go here, don't pass it up.   You will not be sorry.< /Review><UserId.>114414707573424489722<//UserId.><gmap_id>0x80d95359c6d7d695:0x4f36f6af52d3c4f5< /gmap_id></record>

My husband and I had heard really good things about this place, but unfortunately we had left town by the time they were reopened from COVID.

During one of our recent trips back to Cali we were randomly in the area as they were opening and knew it was fate that we must try them!

Boy oh Boy we are so glad that we did! At their downtown San Diego location they have over 70 different flavors available that they make in house!!

All of their ice creams are egg free and they even have dairy free options. One cool thing we found out was that the milk they use has a 7 day or less cow to machine time!! That means they use the freshest milk around!! They even use pecans from a local farm and are made fresh just for them! You can tell the owner “scoop dog” takes pride in quality and customer service.

As we were there ordering a “regular” walked in and was inquiring about a custom ice cream flavor she wanted to have created for her husband who would be coming home from the military and she wanted to surprise him with it. The owner said he’d come up with a special batch just for him! How cool is that?

Because there was so many flavors they have the option to do flights of ice cream... so of course we had to do two flights and a regular scoop.

The flavors we got were as follows:
Bourbon pecan
Give me samoa
Pistachio
Red sky
Kahlua espresso
Graham central station
Key lime
Elvis
Peanut butter salted fudge

First off a regular scoop of ice cream is legit massive!! Probably the same size as a double scoop somewhere! Second…all of his names legit taste as described. The ice creams were all super creamy and had their own unique flavors for each.

Our favorite hands down was the graham central station. It is legit life changing. Its a graham cracker flavored ice cream which is absolutely heavenly and taste like you’re eating honey graham crackers. Theres even a little crunchy grit from the graham crackers, delicious crunchy honey comb pieces for more honey flavor and bits of chocolate. When you go this is a mandatory flavor that you must get!!

We will definitely have to go back to try more flavors. Take your family or just take yourself and get a flight of ice cream so you can have some fun!!<//Text>

Not sure what to say.  We are in our 70's.  We like ice cream.  This was simply the best we have ever had.  Now willing to drive about 50 miles round trip to here their ice cream.  Really good stuff. Worth going out in a global pandemic to get it.  Safely.<//review>

Hands down worth the stop and much better then any branded store that might be nearby.   Had the death by chocolate and salted Carmel was my choice for today and was just great.   Solid and not filled with air.  You definetly get every pennies worth in truly home made ice cream.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFBw4AMZI2L88PJn2dkGNgfEfCfu5OKi-OF5WI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP14wVRMUwcE_vegtey6dIUU5pUMkRv3Ca6aRFQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg7s81mBbcHvNKG7YcNPgmizrCxCGR7uhNFBsw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOROY1PMxo0JbntGfH8Ss7JXzW1yTPofWB9Hv8T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOArjVJ3UbG3iX2asvDKs682CzjxZynR3noY0wL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< Resp>

This is truly the most amazing ice cream we've ever had. Not only are their flavors unique to them and extremely creative, they taste the best. My daughter said the mint ice cream was the best she's ever had in her life, so creamy and the perfect consistency. Their service was very nice too. Juliana was especially accommodating.</Review>

The guy working this night was so friendly and patient with my family. We’re from Texas, and there are ice cream shops all over, but this by far is the BEST ICE CREAM I’ve ever had! The texture was indescribable, but great. I got “one scoop” but it took me like 3 minutes to get down to where I was in the picture I attached. There was so much ice cream that it was hanging so far over the cone (not complaining at all!!) I got the Horchata flavor- tasted just like authentic horchata. So pleased with our visit.</text>

Easily the best ice cream shop I have ever been to. The flavors are creative, unique, and absolutely delicious (personally I love the cake batter and chocolate peanut butter brownie)! The staff here are also the most friendly people ever and their customer service is just as awesome as their ice cream. Definitely my favorite dessert place to go every week!<//Text>

I ordered an ice cream cake for my sons 1st birthday! And all I can say is that it was DELICIOUS. We ordered the Gooy Fudge Brownie on yellow cake and I fell in love. On top of that the Baby Yoda picture on it made it so pretty. I will definitely order from them again. Thanks Cali Cream Team.< /review>

The taste and texture of their ice cream are unique. Their shakes are bomb too! Also their customer service is amazing, the staff are super polite and caring. I would definitely recommend them! ❤️❤️❤️<//text><user_id>106021497857133960760</user_id><resp>None<//resp>< time>

Every single flavor is absolutely divine. You can tell they put their heart into making the best homemade icecream. This will definitely be a frequent stop for our family and all the people that visit us! I'm addicted!!</review>

Great place! Great ice cream, with tons of flavors to choose from (get there early but not because of the line but because it’ll take you awhile to decide what flavor to get). Great customer service. Highly recommended!!</Text>

My son has several food allergies so ice cream shops are usually out of the question for our family. When we were planning a trip to Encinitas I reached out to Julie (the owner) and she answered all my questions. She even gave me her cell phone number in case we had any problems when we visited the shop. I was really impressed with their precautions and how they keep allergens separate and the staff was friendly and helpful. The ice cream was amazing too!< /text>

Nice, friendly staff.  The ice cream is VERY fresh, especially since they make them on premise.

Lots of flavor, absolutely delicious, but best of all, their portions are very generous.</Review>

<review>The ice cream was amazing, we tried coffee toffee, cookies and cream pistachio, and dulce de leche.  The coffee flavor was out at first but th owner coincidentally came at that time with more ice cream flavors and offered to personally hand us the scoop of coffee ice cream even though he was still unloading the new batches of ice cream from his car. Overall, the service was exceptional and I will definitely be coming again.< /review><Name>Isabella<//Name>< user_id>

Wasting time before the game started we were roaming around the Gaslamp district when we bumped into this place.    This is downright the best ice cream I have ever had.   30 plus flavors to choose from and they are shooting for 70.  Owner was on hand and very friendly.

I’m sitting alone in my car eating a sundae that is totally delicious and was made with such care and precision by an employee of this particular BR named Gustavo that I just had to get on here and give him and the place in general, a shout out. It was busy since a local martial arts studio had just let out and considering it’s a cold December evening, the staff was calm and so polite. Bravo, guys. Ciao, Gustavo!< /text>< pictures>

Horrible service. I could see the employees discussing me and my kids right in front of us. The rudest thing I have ever had to deal with. It’s like the two young ladies backed up the young man being  totally unprofessional. They black girl told the other girl he was wrong as he was denying my vanilla ice cream. They laughed together and looked at me like I was butting in their conversation......forget you ARE AT THE REGISTER. The vanilla was on the counter behind him.....he looked at it and laughed so I said forget it and paid for what was in our hands. Then he acted like I got more kid scoops then kids I brought in the store. Question is kid scoops the same price as regular scoops?</text>

<Text>This is so an great place, I highly recommend it. The ice cream is great and the service is even better. It's a really small spot but I was in and out of there quickly thanks to the amazing workers. I really enjoy coming here for a scoop of icecream. Highly recommend for people of all ages.</Text></record>

Thumps up. Go in the opening time bcz it's less crowded. If it's less crowded, you're gonna get good customer service. Actually, it always depends upon servers. Today, I got good service from servers. Usually, busy in the afternoon. My favorite ice cream is chocolate, fruit flavors, nuts, and coffee.<//Review>

Delicious ice cream.  Great service.  Be prepared to walk a little it because parking in this area can be a challenge during busy hours.  There is also a seasonal farmers market in the area that furthers the parking issues when it is open.<//text>

<Review>Worst experience at a BR ever! The guy taking care of me, my wife and my son... His name was Carlos, was so unfriendly and not helpful. Instead of telling us what cookies they had available at the time he keeps telling my son to go to the other side to see what there was when it was simple to just verbalize them to us. Then was rushing us to pick our type of ice cream to move us through and out of a line of maybe 3 others. Not one hello, not one thank you, not one smile. Horrible service. I notice all the other girls helping everyone else very energetic and happy to help. Won't be back to this location.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I asked for a triple scooper strawberry cheesecake waffle cone. The employee said " Are you sure you don't only want 1 scoop" I think he was trying to call me fat.< /review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The favorites of my daughter, with insurance it is of all.
The prices are not so cheap, but they are frozen. ;)
They always tend to you quickly and very well.
The flavors are always the same and they are enough, the Mexican furs have more clear options.
Do not forget to try the chocolate classic and the pineapple coconut.

Siempre te atienden rápido y muy bien.

No dejen de probar el clásico de chocolate y el de piña coco.< /Text>< Name>

It was a super reasonable price for what we got. If you're in the mood for donuts, go here, you can't miss it, it is a bright yellow building.<//review>< pictures>

The smell wafting out onto the street attracted me first and inside it nearly overwhelmed me, and this was late afternoon. The shop was clean and tidy. The attendant was helpful and friendly. If I lived closer, or if this was on my regular route, I would frequent this place.< /text>

I loved this place, their coffee is great and so were their muffins. All that changed one night when I wanted a coffee and decided to come here. It was around 11pm and I was the only customer. There was only one worker who was the donut maker which apparently was also doubling as the cashier. He acknowledged me, so he stopped making the donuts, does that one-finger nose blow into the sink, gets my coffee, takes money, gives me chain, and proceeds to making donuts. Notice I didn't include him washing his hands because he didn't do that. Never going back to this place again.</text>

They have excellent quality donuts and pastries. At the time I go, the owner is there making the next day selections.  I have always received excellent service. I am proud to be a regular customer.</Text>

This was my first time taking Q-Tip to the vet for a check-up (and to help with her nails). The staff there were all accommodating and extremely nice to talk to -- I appreciated their uplifting energy and personalities. The whole process went smoothly and I will be taking Q-Tip back for a check-up in the future!<//review>

Seriously the best vet around. They went really slow with my dog who is super afraid. They let me know exactly what was wrong and how they are going to fix it. I really like that they ask if I want to do routine things as well(I did). The test results came back super quick too! Everything was very cheap. We did A LOT of tests (I asked for them) and routine things and ended up only paying $270. For the amount of compassion and care they have, I'd pay every cent. They really truly care about every animal. What is nice is the whole place is very clean, which is hard to upkeep with all the animals going in and out. I would never go anywhere else. Thank you!</Text>

First, the vets are terrific. They have good knowledge and good with care. The low rating is due to the incredibly poorly run front office. They gave incorrect information about after care. The first time they were sending us home with the wrong drugs, because they miss-reading the chart. The second time they did not know whether a med was already given, or just sent home - with the chart in their hand.</Text>

We took our lizard Rocky to see if he was blind only to find out Rocky was in fact a perfectly healthy little girl. The Dr went over every detail informing us how to correctly care for and feed her. The well visit was priceless for piece of mind for our family pet. The staff at the front office were polite , respectful and cheerful. Curbside service contactless was extremely safe for everybody. I highly recommend. Thank you..</text>

Just brought my guinea pig Boo here because I'm afraid she might have an upper respiratory infection. The staff thus far have been absolutely accommodating, sweet and extremely thorough.  Can't wait for Boo to come home and feel better!
Update: one week later Boo is doing fabulous! She has did have an upper respiratory infection and its been one week in antibiotics. She's energetic, has no more eye gunk or sneezing fits, and eats like crazy!</Text>

Westminster Veterinary Group employees, including those who greet you upon arrival as well as their team of doctors, are all very professional with each giving excellent care.  It is comforting to know that this facility is open seven days a week.</Review>

This became our default vet clinic after adopting our cats from Wags, and it turned out to be a huge blessing. I owe Dr. Hueston one of my young cat's lives. The staff is friendly as well. Giving 5 stars on a Google review doesn't come close to showing how grateful my wife and I am.</text>

<review>They are so kind and respectful of any questions I had. I paid for an emergency visit since my parakeet wasn't doing well. I'm so glad I came here since they truly knew what she needed. It's been a few weeks with her medication and she is doing so much better. I recommend this place absolutely!</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was told my new parakeet had parrot fever.  After spending $1500 on exams, tests, x-rays and medicine, and weeks of worry, there was no improvement in her condition.   So I took her to an avian specialist.  After examining her and reviewing all her records, he said she appeared to be in good health.  He saw no evidence she had ever been sick, other than an upset tummy from following the previous vet's feeding instructions.<//review>< gmapID>

<review>I've been going to Westminster Veterinary Group since 2013 when I adopted a kitten from their sister organization WAGS. I have since moved from the area, but I still make the 20-30 min drive out to them for all of my cats' needs because they are awesome.

Everyone there is incredibly friendly and thoughtful. All of the doctors are kind and take the time to explain everything in easy to understand terms. Currently I make a point to try to see Dr. Rettig as she is so knowledgeable and friendly, but she isn't shy about giving an honest opinion which I really appreciate. It's also easy to make appointments and I get appointment reminders when my cats are due for check-ups and vaccinations. They also have an online store that makes it easy to get prescriptions for medications such as flea meds (and the vet will let me know if I pick one that doesn't seem right for my cat) and then set up recurring deliveries so I don't have to remember to buy them.

I recently went to an appointment for the first time during the pandemic and Westminster Vet had a whole system in place to minimize human contact. I went inside (wearing a mask) to drop off my kitty and then went outside to wait in my car. The vet called me on my cell phone to chat about her recommendations for my kitty, and then the front office staff called to confirm the cost and get approval to move forward. Then I got a text when I could come back inside (wearing a mask) to pay and pick up my kitty. Easy peasy!

It's often challenging to find a good vet, so I'm incredibly happy to have found such a great place with consistently excellent service.</review>< Pics>

<text>What a great place!   The vets & all the staff were awesome!  Vets well informed & answered my questions easily explaining what to expect from my  8 week old puppy.  Office staff was friendly yet professional.  They even have a coffee bar complete with multiple flavors of coffee.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting a vet for their "fur baby".  I would give them a 10 star if I could< /text>< pics>

<text>They are keeping pets, customers and staff safe during this time of health emergency. My guinea pigs needed their nails trimmed and it was great. They come out and pick up the pets. Pay online via text. Waiting outside the office and they return them to you. Never going in office. Only one pet customer at time  Great service to us all!

<Review>This place killed my chicken, from medical neglect!!!  I had 4 chickens who had signs of coccidia....they said they couldn't fit them in except for one bird at a time days apart on a very lethal time sensitive condition (standard care is to treat the entire flock) by the time I got the last chicken in, they put her in a cage for 12 hours and did nothing until she died that evening even though they knew it was urgent and she had been sick for days waiting to get in.  The Asian staff made comments about eating my pet chickens.   Weeks later I called back to try to save my remaining chickens after spending THOUSANDS of dollars at this clinic and was told for EIGHT hours that the vet would call me back just to tell me the dose of medication and NO ONE could even give me the information or return my call.  Instead I kept calling them and was promised that "vet would call me back before they close".  I kept stressing  that this is a life threatening situation.....here is a picture of my being on hold for an hour and a half.....still no call back!  Horrifying treatment; be careful taking your pets here!!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>This vet is AMAZING when I thought something was wrong with my rabbit I was able to schedule an appointment the same day! Which is crucial if something may be wrong with your rabbit. They did a full check up including looking into my concerns, after they looked at him they saw that there may have been a small tooth irratation but nothing much that they could see, they prescribed pain meds to use until he was eating regularly and within 2 days he was back to normal! Although nothing much was done, I loved the kindness of the vet, who was very patient with us, and all the questions we asked were answered with a very descriptive answer! I really recommend bringing any animal here. They are really kind and take the time to help you!<//text>< pictures>

Overall very compassionate staff😊 when my 16 year old Jack Russell was on his last hours I was referred to this clinic . They let me take as long as I needed to say my goodbyes and allowed my family to come in too. When I recently adopted a new puppy I knew he would be treated well. And I’m very pleased once again with their gentle , kind manner especially under our new state guidelines to ensure safety for clients & staff. Thank you!</Text>

I rarely write reviews but I just had to write one here. This is literally the BEST vet around. I’ve had bad experiences at other places but literally every person that works here is great. The staff loves on all the pets and are truly passionate about animals. The vets here have all been very nice and caring, they really take the time to answer all your questions and I don’t feel rushed when I’m there. Dr. Rettig specifically is amazing, she was very patient with my shy dog. Not to mention this place saved my guinea pig’s life when he had bad pneumonia. I’m forever grateful to Westminster Veterinary Group and recommend it to everyone I know with pets!</Text>

<Review>Some workers are very nice and knowledgeable but others are very rude. I mean extremely rude. I was in a room with the dr talking about my pet and I took my mask off for 1 second to take a drink of water as I’ve been sitting here for over an hour and someone from OUTSIDE the room opens the door and very rudely says “put your mask on plz”. I understand the masks however all I was doing was taking a drink because THEY are slow and I’m more than 6 feet away from everyone. No reason I can’t take a sip of water.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1594913317679, 'text': 'Hello, this is Michelle, the owner. I apologize if you felt I was rude.

We have a very tiny space for indoor services and indoor business is complicated right now in CA. Although you were 6ft apart, we are asking all clients to wear a mask throughout the appointment. We do offer courtesy car service if someone chooses not to wear a mask. We also have a treatment yard outside under a canopy. I hope you know if it were my staff not wearing a mask, I would also protect you and make sure they complied.

< review>
I took my rabbit there to get a nail trim, a check-up, and most importantly, the vaccine for RHDV2.  Being a new rabbit owner, and having researched this as much as possible, I had a ton of questions.  Everyone here was very kind and helpful, and spent adequate time answering my many questions.  This was during the COVID period, and everyone wore masks and were careful.  They were also accommodating when I said that I don't do well with shots, and I can't be in the same room with my rabbit, since I had to drive home!  I walked in a nervous wreck but walked out feeling much more calm and prepared.  My rabbit...not so much.  She was ready to get out of there.<//review>

I also really appreciate that they are willing to do simple procedures (blood draws, other lab sampling) in the exam room so I don’t have to leave my girls side.

<Text>Worst clinic ever! They scheduled a return for my turtle 5:30, they took the turtle on time, we stayed in the car waiting, every time that we call they said "more 20 min" it's now 8:50 pm and we still didn't received she back ! Why they didn't say : we are busy, go home and we will call you when she is ready! Ridiculous

We had to put our sweet cat of 16 years to sleep, and everyone here was so caring and understanding, and were able to take us in last minute.  Thank you for everything.<//review>

We bring our bunny here for check ups and also a couple times when he was sick. Our check ups are eighty dollars each and that's pretty good for a rabbit! They take such good care of him. The staff is so friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a rabbit-savvy vet!<//Review>

We looked up your account today to see what may have happened at your pets visit and it appears you were in almost a year ago. Upon looking at the charges we noticed you took 2 medications home for $27 each perhaps the meds you got a written script for to get at another pharmacy was $60? We strive to make sure all clients are happy and we take all reviews and feedback seriously l. If you would like to discuss this further with management we would love to hear from you.

For a simple urinary tract infection they charged over $400!!! It was $60 just for ONE antibiotic medication. I am looking for a new vet, needless to say.< /text><rating>2</rating></record></dataset><record>

So while you were gone they could get them all caught up on their shots and take care of anything else you needed done.

The amount of love and care they give to my old man is phenomenal. I have no intention of bringing him anywhere else. My previous vet suggested to put my baby down or cough up thousands of dollars. Here they have never mentioned such a thing or any of the conditions my previous vet made up. They always keep in contact with me about his results and I have never waiter longer than 4 days to hear back from them. Thank you for being amazing to our family.</text>

Very friendly, concerned inexpensive. And the dr. Works with you on the prices of the medication. And always recommend most medications that you can buy over the counter. But the best of all, if you call and ask a question about your pet. The Dr. tells you exactly what you can do or what your pet can take. I live close by numerous of other vets.  I adopted my dog from wags. I would recommend wags to all.<//review>

I'm very happy with service. Stuff is professional and super caring. They always follow up and call you. It's super easy to get in and same day appointments are always available and when my dog ate chocolate by accident they consulted me over the phone for free. Facility is always clean. Veterinarians are friendly, knowledgeable and caring. Definitely would recommend and already do this place to everyone!< /Review>

<text>Brought my budgie in and Dr Tran was surprisingly knowledgeable of birds, which isn't always the case with a veterinarian office that doesn't specialize in avian medicine. Highly recommend her if you're looking for a place to take your feathered friend. This office was much cheaper than other specialists I have taken my bird to.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>We would like to “Thank you” Dr. Tara Hueston, Dr. Christina Rettig, and Staff at Westminster Veterinary Group for providing best services and taking good care of our sweet dog, Bobby Hoang, in the last ten years. When we had to make the incredibly difficult decision to let Bobby rest in peace on 11/30/2019, you all helped make the entire process as easy as it could have been. You gave us space and time that we needed to stay with Bobby until he passed. You made arrangement with the services company to cremate Bobby. The gentleness and compassion that you showed Bobby and our family are priceless gifts that we will always appreciate.
With Gratitude,
The Hoang Family<//Text>< rating>

My experience was great I am so glad I chose this facility to take my Bunny in for a discharge in her eyes. All staff were kind and friendly, the Vet and her helpers were also very knowledgeable and very gentle with handling my Bunny. This was a great experience and I'm glad my Bunny is doing so much better now! I would recommend this place to anyone, especially fellow Rabbit owners. :)</Review>

I use to be there more often...Thank God I have a healthy dog!  I use to have my dog groomed and board when I travel  and it was great...but they no longer do either of those services.  The vet group was great when there was a need. Cost was very reasonable, everyone was very friendly and great with my dog.< /Text>

Was a customer for 15+ years. At first they were wonderful, but now I think the owners are only interested in gouging their customers. Pushing for costly services and guilting you into getting those procedures done, is the norm at Westminster Vet. The veterinary doctors are good, and I think the doctors don't like pushing the services, but they have no choice. For that reason, it seems like they go through a lot of doctors. Save your $ and find another vet whose focus is on your pets health, not maximizing profits through gouging you.<//text>

<Text>My boyfriend and I have taken our puppy, Daisy, here to get her up to date on all of her shots. The facilities are very clean and modern looking. All the women that work there have been extremely friendly and approachable. The first visit was kind of expensive but with that price we were able to get Daisy checked for all parasites and ailments possible for a puppy, which eased our young puppy parent worries. Since our first visit the rest of her shots have been very inexpensive and the visits were extremely quick (which we love). Overall, we have had only great experiences here. Thank you Westminster Vet Group!</Text>< Pictures>

We have 2 wonderful Dobermans that are family. Stella, our 145 lb German born. Has been a hot mess most of her life going in and out of vets do to her high MA MA needs for constant skin conditions. Recently we found a large mass in her belly and took her to visit Dr. Tran from the Westminster Veterinary Group located in Westminster Ca. After very careful exams Dr. Tran determined that it would be best to have her spayed and the masses removed do the the worry of it becoming a much bigger issue later.. She came out of surgery yesterday and with the help of Dr. Tran and her amazing team, she is doing very well and on the road to recovery.. I wanted to thank you Dr. Tran again and again for the amazing care and support you have provided us through this journey.. I have never seen anyone take such a personal approach to someone else animal as you have our Stella...

<Text>You can't beat the service & staff here at the Westminister Veterinary Group provides. I'm so HAPPY I found them & would recommend anyone try them out (even if you already have a veterinary, go get a 2nd opinion from them) you won't be disappointed & you will feel more at ease. By far the BEST service & staff around, they go above & beyond to take care of you & your beloved pets in every way possible. This is the place you want to take your pets to!

I hate this place with a passion. It is all about the money. Every time I take my puppy here, they charge at least 300-600 dollars per visit. They ran a bunch of unnecessary tests and recommended a bunch of unnecessary medicines.  Even when we just came in for a yearly shot, we came out with a 300 dollars bill. As a new pet owner, I trust them with my pet, but it was a huge mistake. They charged 500 to neuter my newly rescued puppy who is only 5 months. Do not come to this place. There are plenty of places with vets that actually concerned about your pets' well being, not just ripping you off.</Text>

< review>
Womble is 100% her manic bitey little self again
After being brought in being according to the ER vets who had her overnight with a guarded poor prognosis from Parvo (PLEASE VACCINATE ON TIME, my laziness"it's just a couple weeks" cost me a suffering puppy and the financial equivalent of a decent used car) I watched daily as my baby went from lethargically lifting head to greet me, to walking to me, to running to me, and the night before coming home running to me and jumping up and doing her shake shake dance.
Besides the fact that they saved my baby, I am so glad I picked Westminster because of some big differencces between them & other local vets I have been to.
#1) I am lucky, I have decent credit and had never needed it.. I got a loan to get THE BEST most intensive care, however...had I not been able to, they had other good options available, that would have also likely been successful, at much lower cost. Most vets "oh she has parvo..this is our protocol" with no discussion or personal plan. I never felt like money was the primary factor in anything Westminster Vetrinary did, I can NOT say that about some other local vets.
#2) Visiting your pet (if you are not intrusive etc) is ENCOURAGED (other 2 clinics..it's never allowed...I find that suspect, and also I feel like your pets morale is boosted by visiting, and any injury or illness is better recovered from when you are emotionally happy) we visited Womble at least twice daily for an hour or so, and I think it made her stay happier, even at her sickest to know that it was never going to be long before mama or papa would be there to hold her.
3) Overall environment.
It's clean. It doesn't smell like a barn or have metal chairs. I also loved wombles isolation icu room. A real little room with blanket nests and a bed and toys (yes you can bring from home, and they will also get blanket and toy from vet) food water , room to get up and walk (or run ..Womble is 7lbs so it was a master suite for her) I REALLY liked that she didn't have to see or hear other animals..
4) Staff. I can't say that there was anyone on staff I didn't like(I usually can find someone to dislike lol) everyone seems like they are really at the job they want to be at. I had the most interaction with Sebastian the Vet assistant who was Wombles main human for most of the stuff, he was incredibly knowledgeable about everything (full veterinarians were always accessible, and would call with update/come see me at visits) and he spent a lot of time with Womble and made her toys and he really loves animals/his job/has great people skills too. Both vetrinarians were wonderful. I brought Womble in with an hour notice, from a vet that gave her below 30% survival. Dr Tran came in, and said"I cannot guarantee that she will survive yet, but I practiced in Texas, where we have a lot of parvo puppies (I have spent time in Texas, this is true) I have an 80-90% success rate, Womble is otherwise healthy, she should be able to get through this fine" She also went over the other much cheaper options that still had a very good chance. She was friendly and happy and approachable and got on the floor with Womble and just the same feeling that I got from everyone there... working in Vetrinary medicine is what she does because it's what she wants to do, money is not a driving factor.
I will stop my essay now...but really I cannot say enough good things about you guys. Womble is sleeping happily after attacking her cat brothers and sisters and running and jumping and doing her shake shake dance and eating all day.10 days ago she was so sick we thought she might die on the way to the vet. The treatment for parvo is not fun for the puppy, but they made it as happy and comfortable as possible. For the humans too
And Dr Hueston sorry I didn't mention you, but you were great too, and always on top of it with updates.</review>

< Review>
I have been a loyal client for many years and spent thounsands of dollars in surgery, treatments and boarding.
Dr Greenberg one of the best in exotic animals but today after my call with the rude lady and horrible customer service i am looking for another vet for my bunny. They are forcing the clients to pay an extra 80 dollars annually for a "year chk up" MANDATORY otherwise you are not able to book any appointment further. It is incredible they recently sent me an email asking for google reviews to gain more clients i guess but with this horrible customer service and policy they are loosing old and loyal clients like me.<//Review>

<text>Dr. Tia Greenberg is amazing with out dog!! She is only 4.5 years old and a pit mix.Shortly after adopting her we found out she had allergies and is prone to ear infections. Dr. Greenberg has been amazing at teaching us how to help our little one deal with the itching and overall illness. All of their work has been professional, cutting edge and caring and I would highly recommend!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Sad this veterinary group really is all about the money. I took my guy in for an ear infection. Of course they couldn't just treat the ear they had to preform all sorts of tests to determine what kind of ear infection it was. I asked if it was really necessary, of course it could be yeast or a bacteria infection and that would determine the course of treatment. Funny, she  said he had both yeast and bacteria but only gave me 1 medication. I Google the medication and it said it is used for yeast or bacteria ear infections. So the reason for the $300 they charged for all the tests were for what exactly?
Save your money and find a vet who truly cares about your fury friend and not just in it to make a buck.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

If I could give a 0 star review I would.  I took my iguana in for respiratory dieses and the vet had to call around to start this weird Q&A with a specialist not on site. Long story short I paid a $300 deposit for the to take him in. The next day I call to see how he was and they told me he died the day I brought him in. Did not try to contact me at all to notify me of my dead iguana nor was I refunded my deposit. Over priced and absolutely no care for the pets or owners.< /Text>

This Vet group doesn't care about the pet, they are solely in it for the money. I just paid $509 to have my dog spayed and repair a herniated umbilical cord. When they brought her out she had a cone on but her incision wasn't wrapped or covered. I asked why and they said just keep the cone on she will be fine. 2 days later she had ripped the incision open by scratching it with her rear leg. I took her back in and $365.00 later they wouldn't admit it was their fault, they had to put her under again and re suture and staple her incision. They brought her out UNWRAPPED again and after I questioned them AGAIN they said perhaps she shpuld wear a t-shirt to prevent her from scratching it. You think? They needlessly and selfishly put my dog through 2 surgeries in as many days. I will never take any animal back to them and will tell anyone who'll listen to stay away from them.</Review>

<text>After going through a few different vets, we finally found a good place. The place i was going to prior was just after money and nearly left my dogs leg disfigured because they casted it wrong, but luckily we caught onto what was happening. Everytime we come in, the staff is very friendly and welcoming, they greet my dogs like they were their own (my dogs are quite fine with this, it actually puts them at ease). The doctors: Dr. Hueston and  Dr. Tran are very knowledgable and take the time to go over every detail and let me ask as many and whatever questions i have so i have an understanding. They are honest about pricing and procedures. For instance, one of my dogs has been dealing with a foxtail in his leg for awhile now and they lanced it and tried to flush it out the best they could, but unfortunately it didn't get all of it. Instead of doing the procedure over and over again with no avail, they referred me to a specialist because they didnt feel it right to continue to do procedures over and over again if it wasnt working (he had 2  procedues prior from a different vet who claimed it was a tumor, which it wasnt). I appreciate their honesty and will continue to bring my dogs here.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>There were a number of issues with this vet.  They are VERY expensive.  They are very disorganized ( had no record of further instructions that the vet was supposed add to my rabbit's file, gave contradictory advice at a second visit that the vet had set up).  I would not take any pet here.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Dr Greenberg is one of the most respected vets in the country and for good reason.

I am shocked at the bad reviews. It leads me to believe that the money may have been more of an issue to you than your pets welfare. I have never experienced a test that I felt was unnecessary. I hate forking out money but I do it without consideration for the welfare of my kids. Just ask my Care Credit Card.
This is one of the few vets around that cares about the animals and not the money. But realize this is a business and without money they cannot function.

The front desk, most Techs and the Vets know myself and my wife by first name and every single pet we have, Koda, Renji, Skittle-butt, Nani, Scruffy, Toffee and Charmin. How many Vets do you see who need to look at a chart just to remember your name? and still pronounce it wrong. I have even had calls from Dr Greenberg just to see how my kids are doing.

I have nothing but respect for Westminster Veterinary Group and you will be doing your pet a great favor by trusting them.<//review>

I adopted 3 cats. 2 dies from major infections which they got at wags care. they don't check for everything before they let you adopt. we had to put them down because we couldn't help them.and the one we still have we had to take it back to wags to contain an infection which he got during his neutering at wags care which he could of died too.</Review>

They do not know how to run a business.  No follow through on requests for information.  Charges appear in you account then disappear then reappear.  They just charged my account for services rendered  1 and half years ago and blamed it on insurance.  I paid the bill just to be rid of this unethical place.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!<//Text>

No words for how bad this clinic has gotten under new ownership. Insulted by the new doctor for no reason other than to make himself feel good about himself.....highly uncalled for.  Save the drama for your mama. Going to be the better person here and no stoop to their level........<//review>

<Text>Very unprofessional practice. They take a long time in responding to your concerns and then blame for CPAP supply provider for their problems...they also did not get my previous medical records from other providers or Resmed despite releasing my consent months ago. The follow up was supposed to be based on that. Doctor come completely unprepared informing me in the meeting that he does not have result. The charged my insurance for that meeting which was totally meaningless. Next year, as soon as my insurance reset, I will find another practice.< /Text>< Pictures>

I spent a lot of money and my problem was never solved. It felt like the end goal was to sell me a CPAP machine and not help me. The CPAP treatment they recommended to me should not have been recommended for my case. Do not trust any of their recommendations and do your own research!</text>

For patients deciding to discontinue therapy we ask them to come in so our doctors can provide options for alternative treatment. It is the standard course of treatment to not discontinue care without providing other options. We have a disproportionate patient population with sleep apnea because we are a sleep center and almost all of our patients are sent to us by their doctor who already suspects sleep apnea. I left you a voicemail on Monday and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you so we can resolve this issue. Additionally, I did not see any patient responsibility for your most recent appointment.\nAll the best,\nThe Sleep Health MD Team"}<//Resp>< GmapID>

Received a recent clinic sleep test report  (done with wearing BPAP machine) on 10/29/2018.  The results looks confused to me.  The AHI and RDI, Apnea index numbers all looks worse than w/o BPAP test earlier.  However, I was told to use it anyway.  Really needs some explaination or clarification, after using this BPAP for two months already. No return call from doctor regarding this for 1-/12 weeks.<//text>

I can't really speak to the competence of the doctors, as I've only had one short visit with them. However, the office is very disorganized, with seemingly no communication happening between the admin staff and the doctor. The admin staff seems, at best, apathetic and inattentive.

Examples:

I answered an extensive questionnaire via an online portal before my appointment. When I arrived, I answered the exact same questions on a paper form. When I met with the doctor, I handed him the completed questionnaire, which he ignored and proceeded to ask me all the same questions a third time while he completed a form on his laptop.

They did not have the proper cable to adjust my travel CPAP, which was the reason I had made the appointment in the first place.

The doctor referred me to a CPAP service center to get the adjustment done. When I went back to the front desk, they had no idea what I was talking about, and tried to make adjustments to my normal (not-for-travel) CPAP, despite having told them multiple times that it did not need adjustment.

When asked when I wanted to schedule my next appointment, I asked for 4 months out. They told me their schedule isn't available that far in advance.

The doctor told me I would be asked to sign a document approving transfer of records from my previous sleep clinic. The admins didn't do this either. I remembered this after getting in my car and leaving, so I drove back to fill out the form.

None of this instilled a sense of confidence in the quality of care provided by the clinic. I've heard the Los Gatos location might be better, so I will schedule my next appointment there. If it doesn't prove to be any better, I'll look elsewhere.<//review>

The doctor referred me to a CPAP service center to get the adjustment done. When I went back to the front desk, they had no idea what I was talking about, and tried to make adjustments to my normal (not-for-travel) CPAP, despite having told them multiple times that it did not need adjustment.

When asked when I wanted to schedule my next appointment, I asked for 4 months out. They told me their schedule isn't available that far in advance.

The doctor told me I would be asked to sign a document approving transfer of records from my previous sleep clinic. The admins didn't do this either. I remembered this after getting in my car and leaving, so I drove back to fill out the form.

None of this instilled a sense of confidence in the quality of care provided by the clinic. I've heard the Los Gatos location might be better, so I will schedule my next appointment there. If it doesn't prove to be any better, I'll look elsewhere.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Dr. Liebenthal was very thorough in my examination and adjusting the CPAP. She made the effort to further inform my understanding and questions about the results by pinpointing the graph results.  I was impressed that she went immediately to follow up and call the supplier of the BIPAP equipment who have been very slow.  It was great again to visit with Dr. Liebenthal for my follow-up.  She is thoughtful and reviews all facets of my sleep apnea.  She motivates me to continue to try my equipment and instructed me on how to make adjustments . I know she and the team are attentive to my process with the slow Medicare equipment providers.   Follow up visit today was again very thorough - they invited my husband to sit it and she carefully explained her analysis and thinking about my process.  It is always a pleasure to return to a visit with Dr. L.  In her specialist field of sleep apnea  -  she is confident in her knowledge and very comfortable to talk to and does not act hurried. Although I am almost a geriatric,  I would like to say that is as thorough and kind as many pediatricians I have had experienced with younger patients such as my children when they were younger. She is concerned that the patient fully understands the process and very thorough, encouraging and supportive.  Definitely the doctor to choose if you need a sleep apnea specialist who is caring as well as medically experienced.   Dr. Liebenthal  is the best of the sleep apnea specialists I have visited over the years and one of the best doctors I have over decades.   (I usually go the best as I have physicians in the family and have them research it - At this office, Dr. Liebenthal is the best in my experience (one of them was not great ). Appt was prompt and front room staff is attentive.  Difficult to reach office by phone (it is a phone tag process as they are popular or at different offices, the best option is to use their app or go online).   Appt are scheduled way far in advance (4-6 weeks in availability). Sleep tech appt ware very short as changed on me in advance but they do schedule medical and tech appt on separate days - (due to Medicare/insurance rules) so it will sometimes require two appt.< /Review>< Pics>

It's near impossible to get anyone to pick up the phone for this place. Worse the office seems to only be occupied on a few days since the doctors work in Santa Cruz. This makes it impossible to get a hold of anyone ever. Voicemails aren't even returned.</text>

<text>Excellent experience with York Appliances. They installed new Central Heating/Air complete with new ducts and wiring. Quality work at a fair price and job was completed in decent time.
Fernando managed the job and was professional and took time to explain the process. He's knowledgable and honest.
I would gladly recommend York Appliances & HVACR to anyone who's looking for any Heating and Air Conditioning concerns.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I called ~ 5 pm, they said they would try to squeeze me in tonight, but for sure they could come tomorrow evening.  Maybe 2 hours later they asked if they could send someone over.  He fixed my AC immediately.  Very nice, very professional, great prices.  Customer service was excellent.  Would absolutely use again and very happy to refer anyone to them.< /text>

On a hot day like today, I am reminded what a good install York appliances did for me. Not more than a month ago I hired York HVAC for a new mini-split system. Installation far exceeded my expectations and I am happy with my new system. Their fair pricing and thourough understanding of HVAC system, made me give them a try. System running great, and service is recommendable. I was glad they even did a courtesy visit to check on my system. Great service</Text>

This place is one of my favourite spots in highland park / eagle rock. Great people and great service. I bought three appliances one of which had an issue and they cable and fixed quickly. Otherwise the quality of appliances was great and they are still going strong.<//Review>

Great people...awesome service!
Had central air put in on my 1901 home that has never had any type of air system other than opening up my windows. At first I shelved this for a year because I was shopping around but finally pulled the trigger this Spring with York Appliance.
I'm so glad I went with these folks. The explanation on the service and products was thorough and kept in on the loop the entire way. They were professional, clean, and met their 3 day deadline. Any questions I had after the fact were quickly answered.
I strongly recommend YORK Appliances & HVAC/R!<//text>

Fernando installed a new heater in my home. He answered all my questions and addressed my concerns. I like being well informed. His pricing was decent. I did a prior internet search on the cost and asked around. I was happy with the price. Overall, good experience. Ill be back for a stackable in the spring.< /text>

<review>Wow they’re fast, quick, and super attentive. I needed a decent sized refrigerator for my new apartment and was looking into spending less than $300. I walked into the store and immediately found one that fit in my small kitchen and my budget. The lady behind the counter was very nice and friendly and told me the delivery was free! This is definitely the place to go if you’re looking into buying a used, affordable kitchen appliance (with warranty)!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Great customer service, I needed a central heater repaired next thing you know they helped me the same day for a cheap price compared to other places I looked at.I got to say the best part of going there was because of Denisse , she was kind and friendly and sweet. Everything went swell when I talked to her. I want to thank you guys for helping me out on a short notice! You guys are the best!!<//review>

This place is absolutely wonderful! They have amazing customer service and tell it like it is. They have your best interest in mind the whole time and would recommend this place to anyone who doesn't want to be cheated by chain companies. There's nothing like being greeted by friendly faces. #supportmom&popbusiness</review>

Rip off artists.  Buyer beware.

Nope.  A real person you ripped off with a broken fridge that was never repaired correctly.  Enjoying my hard earned money no doubt.</review>

<review>I needed to buy a refrigerator so I went to the shop. A young lady came out to talk to me about the refrigerator I was looking at. I wanted to speak to one of the technicians and she immediately called one of them and he answered all of questions I had. I found that quite impressive, the young lady called the technician only once and he came almost running just to help me. Most businesses make you wait a while before someone actually helps you. I ended up purchasing the refrigertator and had it delivered free that same day. Great service, I recommend.< /review>< pictures>

Today I had a service call and I was supposed be charged $50.  The technician spent 10-15 minutes to reset the ice maker.  He said that the new charge was $75 for the time spent in “fixing” the ice maker.< /text>

I've been meeting to review them but anyways my heater broke about a month back. My house is unbearable with out my heater. I called them and they squeezed me in next day. They fixed the problem, the heater needed some routine maintenance. What made me give them five stars is that they took the time to explain to me how to properly care for my heater. That's going above and beyond in my opinion.<//Text>

<review>I've used this company with some success in the past, but my last two experiences have made it clear that these guys are total hacks and don't take responsibility for their work.

I had them diagnose a dishwasher for me, and after the service call they said it would need to be replaced. When I got them the replacement, they installed it incorrectly. I asked if they would come back and fix what was done, but they refused to come out without being paid for another service trip. The guy, Fernando, I was talking to was rude and confrontational.

I had them scheduled to repair a dryer for me, but I cancelled it. Let me just say I will never being giving this rude and unprofessional business any more of my business.</review></record>

Same day appointment when called up for my hvac that havent been used in years. If you need any appliances or any repairs, and even for the HVAC, this place is your best bet compared to anywhere else! Bought all my appliances at affordable prices as well throughout the years. Overall, my experience with this company is great!</text>

This company tried to charge me over a 100 dollars for the part and over a 100$ for the service.
The total would have been $245.
I found the part for $51 on Amazon.(new)
So shady do not go there it s a scam.
It is so stupid to be dishonnest you are just loosing buisness .</Review>

Johnny and Carlos came to my house to fix my stackable (washer dryer). The washer part of my stackable was over flowing. Took them less than an hour to fix it. I kept asking them questions (I felt I was being a it annoying) about the repair but they never lost their patience with me. Previously, I bought a French door fridge from them. Afforable and still works like a charm, it's been about a year (Will update when it stops working. Hopefully never.)< /Text>

Excellent experience with York Appliances. They installed new Central Heating/Air complete with new ducts and wiring. Quality work at a fair price and job was completed in decent time.
Fernando managed the job and was professional and took time to explain the process. He's knowledgable and honest.
I would gladly recommend York Appliances & HVACR to anyone who's looking for any Heating and Air Conditioning concerns.< /Text>

I called ~ 5 pm, they said they would try to squeeze me in tonight, but for sure they could come tomorrow evening.  Maybe 2 hours later they asked if they could send someone over.  He fixed my AC immediately.  Very nice, very professional, great prices.  Customer service was excellent.  Would absolutely use again and very happy to refer anyone to them.< /text>

<Review>On a hot day like today, I am reminded what a good install York appliances did for me. Not more than a month ago I hired York HVAC for a new mini-split system. Installation far exceeded my expectations and I am happy with my new system. Their fair pricing and thourough understanding of HVAC system, made me give them a try. System running great, and service is recommendable. I was glad they even did a courtesy visit to check on my system. Great service</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c40d053ed4ed:0x3fa632d7275e3226< /Gmap_id></record>

This place is one of my favourite spots in highland park / eagle rock. Great people and great service. I bought three appliances one of which had an issue and they cable and fixed quickly. Otherwise the quality of appliances was great and they are still going strong.<//Review>

Had central air put in on my 1901 home that has never had any type of air system other than opening up my windows. At first I shelved this for a year because I was shopping around but finally pulled the trigger this Spring with York Appliance.
I'm so glad I went with these folks. The explanation on the service and products was thorough and kept in on the loop the entire way. They were professional, clean, and met their 3 day deadline. Any questions I had after the fact were quickly answered.
I strongly recommend YORK Appliances & HVAC/R!< /text>< Pictures>

Fernando installed a new heater in my home. He answered all my questions and addressed my concerns. I like being well informed. His pricing was decent. I did a prior internet search on the cost and asked around. I was happy with the price. Overall, good experience. Ill be back for a stackable in the spring.< /Review>

Wow they’re fast, quick, and super attentive. I needed a decent sized refrigerator for my new apartment and was looking into spending less than $300. I walked into the store and immediately found one that fit in my small kitchen and my budget. The lady behind the counter was very nice and friendly and told me the delivery was free! This is definitely the place to go if you’re looking into buying a used, affordable kitchen appliance (with warranty)!</Review>

My furnace was being extremely noisy, it wasn't terrible but the noise would get pretty annoying. I called them in and they gave me an appointment for the next day.  The job was quick and they explained to me everything which was nice. Overall they were friendly and the cost was reasonable. What more can I ask for? Thanks Fernando!</text>

Rip off artists.  Buyer beware.

Nope.  A real person you ripped off with a broken fridge that was never repaired correctly.  Enjoying my hard earned money no doubt.</Text>

I needed to buy a refrigerator so I went to the shop. A young lady came out to talk to me about the refrigerator I was looking at. I wanted to speak to one of the technicians and she immediately called one of them and he answered all of questions I had. I found that quite impressive, the young lady called the technician only once and he came almost running just to help me. Most businesses make you wait a while before someone actually helps you. I ended up purchasing the refrigertator and had it delivered free that same day. Great service, I recommend.<//text>

I've been meeting to review them but anyways my heater broke about a month back. My house is unbearable with out my heater. I called them and they squeezed me in next day. They fixed the problem, the heater needed some routine maintenance. What made me give them five stars is that they took the time to explain to me how to properly care for my heater. That's going above and beyond in my opinion.< /text>

I've used this company with some success in the past, but my last two experiences have made it clear that these guys are total hacks and don't take responsibility for their work.

I had them diagnose a dishwasher for me, and after the service call they said it would need to be replaced. When I got them the replacement, they installed it incorrectly. I asked if they would come back and fix what was done, but they refused to come out without being paid for another service trip. The guy, Fernando, I was talking to was rude and confrontational.

I had them scheduled to repair a dryer for me, but I cancelled it. Let me just say I will never being giving this rude and unprofessional business any more of my business.<//text>

Same day appointment when called up for my hvac that havent been used in years. If you need any appliances or any repairs, and even for the HVAC, this place is your best bet compared to anywhere else! Bought all my appliances at affordable prices as well throughout the years. Overall, my experience with this company is great!< /Review>

I normally go to this place in Ontario, but today I was in the area and decided to stop by.  The guy that was working i believe was the owner.  He greeted me, talked to me, and helped me with everything I needed.  I was surprised because I never get this kind of service at a smoke shop.  I will for sure be coming here from now on.  5 stars 🌟 all the way</Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>I go to Chino Smoke and Water at least 2-3 times a week. Nick and Ray are awesome!!! I refuse to go anywhere else!  The customer service alone is enough for me to keep going back. I always use to smoke hookah and bought from them all the time. But when I decided to start using a vape instead, they helped me with my transition. They taught me how they work and always change my coil for me. When I have problems with my vape, they help me fix it. They always go above and beyond for me. I never ever ever leave reviews, but they deserve this. I highly recommend them for all your smoking needs. They are great people!!!<//text>< Name>

<Review>This is my go to spot for anything related to vapes and water pipes. They have a good selection to choose from and the prices are low. I been to other smoke shops that had the same thing's they have here but more expensive. If you're on a budget you'll find something in your price range here for sure.<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1594952802437, 'text': 'Thank you very much for your support 🙏💐💐💐☺️☺️'}</Resp>< Rating>

<review>I bought cigarettes here a few times, not a bad  place.
Response to the owner's comment: If you don't sell cigarettes then why is your store called a smoke shop? I've bought cigarettes here a few times and it's funny that you don't sell cigarettes yet your a smoke shop. You've  just lost business then. If you don't sell cigarettes then there's no point in going here anymore, since I smoke cigarettes.
Response: There is no cigarettes next door to your cigarette store. No worries, I'll just buy my cigarettes somewhere else then. Best of luck with a smoke shop not selling cigarettes. Never heard of that before but whatever and FYI, there is no liquor store by you, only a mobile gas station. That's not even the same thing.</review><gmapID>0x80c332e864d3faf9:0xbcb6811e60bcc31a</gmapID>< Pics>

Cool guy working at the counter. I feel that good smoke shops should get a good review, plus they stay open a little later. Good variety of products, came in for a bowl since I broke mine last night and this is a smoke shop I'll definitely come back to.< /review>

Best price on everything smoke related compared to other shops in the area. The gentelman let me try out my battery before purchase so excellent business practice. Also happen to get my filtered water here. One stop shop.< /text>

<review>I bought a smok 22, they have fake models that are bought on DHgate or AliExpress. I confronted them and they did refund my money. I will no longer buy from this spot there is far to many shops out there. I rather not have to siphon through the fakes whilst shopping.< /review>< date>

I've been in here a few times and have never left disappointed. It's a tiny shop but they have what I need. After my regular vape shop let me down with their customer service I knew I could come here and get a great deal as well. But was I surprised! They actually had a 420 sale and I got my vape mod for a way better price then my regular shop plus the dude working was funny as hell and answered all my questions. They even had pizza and soda for their special. 😁 Check our their discounted selection of vape juice they have. All in all great shop.< /review>

<name>Charles Bohe< /name><Date>1620882812108< /Date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>We started our evening at Philippe the Original for their double dip French sandwiches. The sandwiches were excellent with the meat cooked perfectly. One aspect that was nice about Philippe The Original is that there was plenty of free parking, a real treat in LA. Even with the Covid precautions we were able to go in and find an empty booth at about 7PM. May be a little crowed during peak meal times. The dill pickle was excellent. The potato salad had chopped dill pickles added which created a marvelous taste.<//review>< pictures>

This is one of LA’s gems, they’ve been here longer than some of the buildings in downtown! Serving sandwiches since 1908, you have to give em a try. Today I had the turkey dip, but I’m a fan of the beef dip too! I hear the NY pastrami is one of their signatures as well and don’t forget to ask for extra dip, cause who doesn’t like soggy bread?! I also added some Swiss cheese just to add some other flavors. I snagged a pickle but I have yet to try their other sides, though they were well dug into, so I’m sure they’re just as good. Fun lunch spot, they have indoor and outdoor seating. Indoors is a cute little lunch hall style room with a snack bar on the way out in case you need something sweet to end with because their sandwiches are so savory. They even have a house mustard that comes highly suggested. Definitely enjoy this little trip to the past as it’s still counter service only and historic memorabilia all over, they still take great pride in their service to LA.</review>

WAIT TIME: 15 min lining up on a Monday afternoon

Got the beef dip, single-dipped.
Lamb was also juicy and flavorful

Sides:
Pickled egg
Coleslaw

I liked that everything wasn’t overly salted or seasoned. Pickled egg was sour and refreshing. Coleslaw was standard and not so sweet just to my liking.

Sawdust on the floor - never seen this before and had to google it! Sawdust is highly absorbent and can quickly contain spills of water or any liquid. It is also used to absorb smells. Apparently this is a thing of the past?</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLVpIusqLzAjfxxtFqYIHK0gxPpK_OUDfG__Fu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPX1gJoTZFnHQWblwU50fLWaBxFZ-SRNGMSa7TF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgHCTX_Q0PwdAi8LMkCRTx8ubSkV1uGFftYApv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPBgBZW9SRJYmagec9BM6D_GRzha0x_eW3tHQwO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< rate>

<Review>What hasn't been said about this institution? We were coming off a 400 Mile road trip and trying to think of where to stop for dinner on a Sunday night and Philippe was the perfect choice with their  great people and consistent quality. We have three kids under 6 and clean bathrooms, quick service and real food are everything we could ask for. Additionally, their pandemic protocols gave us the comfort to know our health and safety were as important to them as they are too us. Thanx!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>They are handling the pandemic beautifully.
You order your food and pick it up inside. They're very quick about it.
it's easy to social distance plenty of space between tables.
A well-dressed, masked server was available outside, prepared with napkins, ice water, utensils, condiments and other things you might need.
It was a good feeling. The beef dip was excellent< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5xA2tN-5_0LnDcPJeoqtkA5pIRTeytUcySpjx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0WbrOi2N1GoXYzbjESt4uzb4cd2YWXBKNpzE_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN23JSzWDRz1fCeP9GPsMWzmtbu4NzdRr8l_XYC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

One of those places, you know it’s there, you’ve heard everyone say how good it is, and I’ve never stopped in and tried for myself, until today.

The line was out the door and around the corner, they have the back parking lot set up with tables. We placed our order online and took it to go.

I don’t know why I waited so long, but you shouldn’t because the sandwich was delicious and everything everyone talks about.

I went with the Original beef dip, once dipped with Jack cheese and the sweet hot mustard. The bread was still crunchy outside and slightly wet on the inside, not soggy at all.< /text>

<text>Philippe's is an amazing place with a ton of history. They also have claim to be the inventor of the French dip sandwich, which has been contested by another LA staple institution- Cole's! Anyhow, I ordered a pastrami French dip(wet) with potato salad and a pickled egg! Whatever you do- don't deny yourself the pleasure of a pickled egg. Their potato salad was spot on and their French dip was to die for. At the mere mention of it, I can feel myself salivating. For those who enjoy an extra kick to their meals, order a small side of horseradish sauce- it'll flare up your nostril and char your taste buds, but it burns soo good! They also have a great beer and wine selection! In regards to parking, they have a large lot, and I have never had any difficulty finding a spot; the location recently opened up dine-in! They've come a long way and if you're tired travel coming in from Union Station, make the walk and have a bite. You won't regret it.< /text><user_name>Hugo Aguas</user_name><userid>116628034618659398361<//userid>< Resp>

Love this place! As delicious as the first time I tried this place. Got the beef double dip with American cheese, cole slaw, pickled beets, custard, tapioca pudding, a pickle, lots of spicy mustard, and an Arnold Palmer to wash it down. The price is steadily going up but you'll never taste anything like this! They have inside seating as well as outside seating, parking, and restrooms. I'll post the next time I go back. Maybe I'll try the lamb dip next</text>

<Review>Had the beef dip wet. This sandwich has been on my bucket list for a while, and it did not disappoint. Great beef. Great jus. Great bread. Loved every bit of it, especially the jus.

Also, the apple pie was very solid.

An LA classic who is handling the pandemic as well as they can. Very specific protocols in place for distancing and separate entrance and exits to help with flow of foot traffic. They even added outside dining with security to help with any crowd control. Food is as good as I remember, but it’s been a while and the bread seems smaller but meat ratio better for it. I good trade off from my perspective. Tried the beef, lamb and pastrami to split with my GF. All delicious. Service was a little slower due to changes in the process, I think, so be prepared. Not bad, just have to go to the back for different items. All in all worth the trip to downtown LA for a taste of a classic.<//text>

Just on atmosphere alone, ya gotta luv this place.  Sawdust on the floor, a whole wall of model trains and artwork/posters from the 20s &30s.  Ya almost expect Hepburn & Tracy to be sitting in the booth next to the one you take.  Now, almost everyone goes there for their "famous" French dip sandwiches, and they are good, real good.  However, they've got some unheralded gems that keep me comin' back.  Their beef stew is awesome....filled with beef, potatoes, carrots, celery and onions, it's as good as what mother made.  And her beef stew was the best thing she made.  The best part tho...before the pandemic, it was $4.25 a bowl(give or take a quarter).  Not a cup, a BOWL.  Their cole slaw is great(yeah, I know what yer thinking, cole slaw??)  It's reeaally good.  Then to top it off, I defy anyone to find a better restaurant slice of banana cream pie than Philippe's.  However, all that said, I gotta admit I was there for the time in about 15 months last week and almost everything was as good as I remember, but the stew was overloaded with too many potatoes and not enough beef.  Turned into soggy mashed potatoe mush by the time I got half way thru.  Hopefully that one time was only an aberration.<//review>

There is nothing I could say that hasn't already been said. But that won't stop me from singing their praises. Just about every sandwich is delicious. I love their new online presence. We have ordered online 3 times and everytime it have been perfect. You might think that french dip is the only thing they do, but I have not had a bad thing on the menu, so if they make it - it's probably good.< /Text>

The cole slaw could've used a bit more pepper, but that was an easy fix. Everything pickled was delicious, especially the beets. The custard and pie were the perfect ending to the meal.</text>< Pictures>

Sandwich was warm 🥵 bun was very dry. Swiss cheese did not melt because sandwich 🥪 was cold. Coffee was luke warm not hot, my C&H sugar packet did not dissolve because of lukewarm coffee, need to invest on a new coffee maker. Because the heating element is worn out. With all these service issue I still enjoyed my sandwich because I had the time between connecting trains at Union Station. 🇺🇲🕊️😲< /text>

I found this place by accident during a business trip to LA. This was a great find. I got the pork dip (double dipped) with Jack cheese. Sides were macaroni salad and come slaw with cheesecake for dessert. Everything was great!!<//Text>

My wife's family started going here in the 30s and that is not unique. Every time we go there as we are standing in line, people there always lots of  people nostalgically commenting that they have been coming for generations.  As for us, we are up to five generations of happy customers in my family.</review>

You can't go wrong at Phillippe's. One of the best dipped sandwich shops in Southern Cal. The aesthetics of the traditional ambiance is a bit hindered by the structural precautions taken in preparation of the covid pandemic. There is still outdoor dining while the percentage rule is in place for indoor dining. I could be wrong and maybe it's just a matter of getting older, but I visit at least twice a year since I was around 15 years old, and I distinctly remember the lamb tasting a bit gamey back then, better I think, and now seems more tamed as far as flavor is concerned.
I added camera shots of the menu taken 3/30/21

I used to love coming here. It's been a Family tradition. But recently both visits have been a let down. Cold busquits. Small now and only 2. Super salty corn beef hash. Only thing that was still good was the coffee. Real disappointed.</Text>

An original LA establishment filled with nostalgia that makes my mouth water just thinking of it. Is this the best french dip in the world? No. Is this the best in LA? No. Is it the best value? No. Is it LA? Hell yeah it is. This is one of LA's quintessential sandwiches for good reason.< /Review>

We always get a sandwich when we are anywhere near the area. We have even driven 2 hours just to enjoy a sandwich.  They have never disappointed.</Text>

<Review>It was very tasty, I prefer the lamb french dip. Only reason that I didn't give a full 5 stars is that there was not very much au jus. Other than that it was very tasty. Worth the trip and it is in a very pretty area and the outside seating was very good. Also the staff is very kind and very helpful as well.</Review><username>Urry Donahoe<//username><GmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5< /GmapID>< time>

The sandwiches are unlike any other and delicious! I've been coming here since I was kid and the simple menu plus the historic ambience, makes it a "must go" in LA.</Review>

<Text>Wowza. I can see why this place has been open for so long. The sandwich was delicious. Definitely opt for the "wet" style. The pickle and egg I got was ok but the banana cream pie was delicious. Next time I will just get those two and three glasses of tea since they serve tiny quantities.<//Text>< Pics>

Love the "Beef Stew" so tender and fresh. Lamb sandwich with blue cheese is fantastic. Before a Dodger game was the place to be!! Miss the saw dust floors before Covid made it impossible to eat inside. Must try!!</Text>

They are handling the pandemic beautifully. You order your food and pick it up inside. They're very quick about it. You can get it to go, or eat outside. Tables and a huge canopy are set up behind the restaurant, and it's easy to social distance... plenty of space between tables. A well-dressed, masked server was available outside, prepared with napkins, ice water, utensils, condiments and other things you might need. It was a good feeling. The beef dip was excellent! Good prices, too.<//text>

It was fantastic as always, it was very well cleaned and they had a lot of precautions concerning the covid-19. They were quick and efficient when they took orders and it got to your food. The food quality is as good as always and they were very kind and very quick with customer service<//text>

I haven’t been here for a while. My uncle used to bring me here for lunch when I was a kid. The double dip beef, potato salad, and a glass of lemon ice tea brought back memories. Life is good!<//Review>

Iconic joint  that does not disappoint. This last visit  my party of 3 ordered a lamb dip, pork, and a beef dip. We attacked pickle spears, a pickled hard-boiled egg, potato salad, a brownie and a chocolate cake 😍 oh yeah we took our time and pigged out. Delicious< /Review>

My first time visiting and it was great!  Lines moved quickly and staff was friendly. There's community seating and if you like your privacy, you can take up a booth.
Loved every bite of my NY Pastrami sandwich! It had a generous serving of pastrami and the French bread was just right.  I had the dip put on the side,  so I can dip top my liking. My side of potato salad was very flavorful and the lemonade was just right,  not too sour or sweet.
Don't forget to get your side of little yellow peppers if you want to spice it up.<//review>

<Review>This sandwich was an amazing experience! The meat and the dipped bun is so soft, it just melts in your mouth  the pickles are amazing. The cucumber is crunchy and has a sharp, delicious flavour. The chicken soup was a very nice warm-up before the sandwich. Their mustard is very nice. It is spicy and has a nice flavour. One should buy a bottle of it and bring it home. It goes well with other foods as well. The interior is very nice. The wood chips on the floor, the posters, the benches, everything together gives a nice and unique atmosphere to the eating experience. The staff is very nice as well and they work quickly and efficiently.</Review>< Rate>

<Review>Historic LA eatery that's worth a visit to at least once in your life! Many establishments offer beef dip sandwiches on the menu but very few can claim to be the progenitor of the dish.  Philippe is one of the top contenders and I can say with great confidence that they are very deserving of the title!

They offer a large variety of sandwiches and sides,  all of which are very good. Everything off the menu is always fresh and very tasty.

Ambience is very cozy,  there's lots of knick knacks around and the restaurant space occupies a two story building,  there's lots of nooks and crannies.

Parking is nightmarish 95% of the time,  but that's because it's LA. Thankfully the location is a short walk from Union Station, Oliveira Street,  or China Town.  So pick your spot and walk!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Love, love Philippe's !!!! The dipped roast beef sandwiches are "Thee Best" !!!! Sooo tasty and juicy..and packed with great tasting roast beef. Soooooo satisfying to eat! The Cole slaw is very good also and you can buy a pickle to enjoy with it. And they have this "Crazy Mustard" that is insane...can't wait to go back again !<//review>

It's was good, the only bad thing was that the banana cream pie was a let down. Wasn't fresh, or very flavorful.</review>

<review>Love a good French dip sandwich. Have been coming here since I was a kid. My kids were not with me on this round. I like how they have set up the dinning area so it is easier to know where the line is. They have social distancing in place. I'm so glad they are still open for business as the quality of food hasn't changed. My visit was to go only.< /review>< userid>

You can't beat this place, it's worth the drive and I make sure I go at least monthly if not more. Favorite meal in LA; Philipe's Beef dip, potatoes salad and banana cream pie. And a cold beer of course!<//Text>

They've also done a good job with new construction for permanent walls to help with social distancing for safe ordering.< /review><GmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Iconic, historical foodie shop from LA's past, preserved for our current day enjoyment. Original French Dip sammie shop, so I'm told. Clean, cafeteria style with tasty meats! Cool to hang out & linger back in time. Went late on a Sun. Not too much hustle & bustle.  Def reccomend.</Text>

Parking always hard to find like the rest of LA city. Outside seating available, but line to enter plus order is as bad as waiting in line at a theme park. Best to order ahead & pick up.< /Text>

<review>I had heard a lot about this place, mostly because it had been around for quite a while. It has a good amount of parking and is open late than most places in Chinatown. A big plus is that you get the food rather quick, which is good. I was fortunate to come when it wasn't so busy although I have heard they tend to have crowds. I tried the beef dipped french dip sandwich since that's what its mostly famous for. To be honest... it wasn't amazing. It was good, but it was lacking that wow factor. I felt with other ingredients, it could be definitely a lot better tasting. It was my first time coming and I do want to try it again, since I feel next time I'll be more in tune with the menu, and perhaps I can make a combination that I feel would redeem that wow factor for this place. For now, it still stands a good place to come at least once, with plenty of choices, seating, clean restrooms and good service, I think I will definitely come back.< /review>< Pics>

<Text>food is very good
I've been coming here for over 25years!!!
but one thing is the Service is not good at all out of 10 girls maybe 3 of them on a good day are gracious. I don't know if they truly like serving patrons?? how do you not put a fork on tray if your customers order cole Slaw?? 2 orders why did I have to ask ? I enjoy the food but definitely not the service they are not giving me my food for free I'm Paying 30.00 and up for lunch< /Text>< GmapID>

The lamb was tender, the mustard spicy, but the black olives were bland. Oh, the cheesecake was creamy and of course delicious.</text>

<review>Trust me you won't regret going here. The owners are extremely polite and definitely love what they're serving to their customers. They told me they spent months refining their recipe and even visited Nashville to further the authenticity of their chicken.<//review><name>Bruce Simmons< /name><Rate>4<//Rate>< Pics>

A Los Angles institution.  This is one of those places that you just have to try once, when you visit LA.  I think I've seen it featured on the Food Network a while back as well.  Philippe specializes in "french dipped sandwiches", of which there are several varieties.  My favorite is the turkey dip.  They also have a wide variety of other choices and even serve breakfast in the morning (never tried it).

I just ate there the other day after almost 20 years and it's still the same great quality as it was back then.  Great place!</Text>

Came here while running around downtown LA! I was surprised because you order and get your food at the same time in parallel with around 10 other customers and the food is carved out for you!

Food: I got the beef dip sandwich double dipped and with French roll. I was pleasantly surprised by how standard these ingredients were but how well it all worked together. There was a nice juicy texture and each bite had me wanting more.

Service: Nonstandard ordering where you go up to the front and ask the server to prepare your sandwich for you.

Ambiance: There’s a lot of space here to sit and it’s definitely a nice little place to chill after a long walk.

Would come back to try a different sandwich!</Text>

This is the best spot to come for an authentic classic french dipped sandwich experience! I ordered the beef french 'double' dip with blue cheese. All the sides are delicious and the deserts are great too. Parking is easy in the lot across the street but be careful during rush hour. You will not be disappointed if you choose to eat here but don't be expecting a fancy sit down restaurant, more like a delicious weekend lunch spot after a sporting event. Enjoy!<//Review>

Philippe's is a Los Angeles institution.....great beef dips, great potato salad, macaroni salad, great coleslaw.... awesome homemade pies..my favorite is Cherry 🍒🍒 pie.
Very clean, Social distancing, outside covered dinning experience.. the bus boys clean every table with antibacterial cleaner after each use.

<Text>The best sandwiches ever!! Made fresh to your taste. No inside dining at the moment,  however,  they converted the parking lot into a huge outdoor dining area.  As each person leaves all of the tables and chairs are sanitized.  Plus the added bonus tables are litterly 6 feet apart and staggered to ensure social distancing.< /Text>< pics>

Haven't been here since I was 10 years old (40+ yrs ago). Woke you Valentine's Day thinking about their beef dip sandwich. Everything looked smaller than I remember, including the sandwiches. The meat was tender, the au jus was tasty, & the blueberry pie was good. Worth the drive from Huntington Beach? Due to Covid traffic was light & it was something different, so yes.< /text>

A very solid chicken sandwich, but save yourself the heartache and go to Philippe The Original.However, Dave's chicken was very crispy and well done. They don't play with their spice either -- one bite of the extra hot had me dripping with sweat. Slider's were huge and definitely did not leave hungry.My personal preference has Rays over Philippe The Original, but it is very close.< /Review>

If I had a complaint, it’s that they aren’t 24-hour to fit some of the odd times I’m in the city passing through. That and the sawdust on the floor. As a traveler, the wheels on my check bag aren’t fans of the sawdust, but it adds to the nostalgia of the place.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRQvGZMqtHUQ81sLiIrMjsQGFUFCOAoxjE415P=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPi7x96QyszrC2N-lfosPGhiK6w2cvx0RWam0Sy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo2MNqP5N0HnxUTgJABIR1TKA1k0anDWF9pZ3B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3BW4piYq5mpuPolh9M7Xx44WJQsumiMtbspo8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
Au jus anyone? Philippe's  is a classic eatery with a nostalgic feel and a short  drive away to downtown LA. The female employees uniforms are a tastefully done and nice to look at; reminding me of a time when restaurant servers presented themselves with a touch of class! .Serving up a wide variety of soups, stews, breakfast and the ever famous sandwiches.We usually go for the au jus beef and it's tasty good! There's not much to it other than the bread of your choice, au jus dipping juice/sauce and a protein; in this case the beef and pastrami. The beef was good but the ratio of bread to beef was not balanced(same for the pastrami) too much bread or not enough protein.For the portion served ,it should have cost less; you do have the option to add mustard and or mayo. Next time I will have the sandwich dipped instead of dipping juice on the side. The sides were good but the brownie was dry and chalky. Outside is a large very nice clean tent set up for patio dinning; good thinking/planning on behalf of management and staff. So if your ever in the downtown area, be sure to visit Philippe the original.  Don't forget your masks!< /Review>

<Review>We have been coming here for years! While it can be busy at times the food lines move quickly and there is almost always room to e sit and eat at the tables. Most people forget about the upstairs eating area. So if it looks packed on the main floor head up! When you get there find a line. While it may seem that some move faster then others they all move about the same speed. If you have some time walk around the inside of the building and check out the pictures on the walls of various Los Angeles history.

If you come for breakfast lunch or dinner you won’t be disappointed. There are enough options that everyone in your group will find something they like! Be sure to try the French dip. It’s what Philippe’s is known for. Just be cautious with the hot mustard on tables. You might want to try a little before you smother your sandwich with it!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Safe distancing, practicing safe protocols. Outdoor dining in the parking lot to enjoy the famous french beef dip with some sinus clearing horseradish mustard. A bowl of chilis with beans, cheese and onions on the side and a glass of beer or wine makes a great lunch.< /review>

An L.A. institution. I can't visit downtown without coming here. Famous landmark for their famous French dipped sandwich.  Always a great sandwich, and sides. So many side dishes and desserts to choose from. The sandwiches whether beef or pork, are best double dipped and with their hot mustard. Although you can order just a dipped sandwich, if you want it a little drier. Yes, the mustard is "hot," so just add a little but to give your sandwich a kick. They have pickles, potato and macaroni salad, coleslaw, and potato chips. You can order a side salad, chili with or without beans, beef stew or a daily soup. They also offer many dessert options, such as fruit pies, cream pies, cakes, custard, tapioca or ice cream. They also offer breakfast early in the day. There are so many options to choose from, and they are all delicious.<//text>

< Review>
Delicious food that provides service quick! You will need to carry your tray of food after purchasing.

The line isn't the clearest but try to read the crowd.

The location is right at the corner, you won't miss it!

For those with allergies, be mindful of the sawdust.

Plenty of parking since they have two large lots nearby.

Seating is available further into the place itself and they also have a 2nd floor to accommodate guests.

Bathrooms are located in the back after the booths.</Review>

How don't I have a Philippe's review alrwady. My absolute favorite sandwich on earth! I love the beef dip, add Swiss, double dipped with a side of their delicious pickles.

Covid response is great. They have a huge tent with no walls in their parking lot. Friendly staff cleaning up after you and sanitizing each table. A full on sink with warm and cold water outside to wash up at, and of course sanitizer. The best response you can expect, and still the reliable tastiest sandwiches on the perfect bread.<//Text>

The Pastrami was fresh and tasty. The service was quick and curteous. Glad we got there early, it gets packed quick. Lots of history and things to purchase there too. Bathroom was super clean which is always a good sign. Forgot to mention. Get the potato salad on the side. It's perfect.

A French dip sandwich shop. First time trying it and it was quite nice. We ordered a turkey and beef sandwich, cheese is extra cost.

The servers are really nice and friendly. There are lots of seating and extra condiments are provided on the tables.

There are multiple entrances. The whole place has a cozy American atmosphere.< /text>

< Review>
My my grandpa and dad brought my brother and I here when we were just little kids. That was over sixty years ago. We both kept that tradition going our entire lives by bringing family and friends here. Sadly, my wife and brother have passed away. But I have another grandson on the way, and God willing, I'll be around to bring him here too. P.S., I always buy the lamb double-dipped with nothing on it, and slather some of Philippe's mustard on it.<//Review>

Philippe The Original is always a treat for a Dodgers fan, such as myself. With the pandemic, they've turned their parking lot into an alfresco dining area. I enjoyed it just as much as had I been inside.< /text>

I am super pleased with how Philippe's has adjusted to continue operations during this pandemic.  I haven't been since prior, just because I figure it wouldn't be that good by the time I got home.  I decided to swing by as I was in the area, and to my surprise, they had an outdoor seating area!  Thank you Philippe's, glad to have gotten food that I've been craving!<//text>

< review>
Enjoyed the experience of such an iconic location.   Tried a beef French dip and a pastrami, and got sides of potato salad, mac salad, and a pickled egg.  Food didn't quite meet our expectations; it wasn't bad but we didn't think it was quite the level of "famous" .   Glad that we followed another reviewers suggestion to request double-meat, double-dip.  Pricier but definitely a more impressive looking sandwich.  Disappointed that they forgot the requested cheese add-on but it wasn't a big deal since we weren't charged for it.  Service was friendly and prompt. Gotta try it at least once.  They do a good job with the current required safety measures and there's a nice outdoor dining area.</review>

My favorite is the beef dip (double dipped) it's not to soggy and has the perfect amount of beef and bread. The hot mustard is famous and you can buy a  jar to use at home. They are practicing social distancing and have a nice system so you are using clean pens to sign for your credit card payments.< /Review>< pictures>

Yesterday, we ate our lunch in this restaurant. The staff is polite, pleasant, highly trained, and good looking. You can find Italian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cuisines. Everything you need for a delightful meal is here. You just can't say no to any food they served. It was all perfect and delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.<//text>

Oh my goodness it's a staple of LA. PLENTY of parking around this part of China Town. Don't sleep on the chili it's super tasty. One of my favorite sandwiches is the lamb... LA wouldn't be the same without this soul filling place with kind and loving service. I just wish they refilled their ice tea :(<//text>

$$-  Historic Delicatessen  sit down restaurant that's been serving french dip sandwiches since 1908 , clean , cozy atmosphere, friendly staff.
Sandwiches : Yummy & Tasty.
Serving the original french dipped sandwiches, and breakfast.
Breakfast  Served 6:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.
Options here counter service or take out.
Long lines but moves fast worth the wait.
My favorite here was the lamb dip sandwich, double dip.
Also very good  potato  salad, And by far one of the best tasting refreshing lemonade.
Very good size and tasty breakfast served here.
Also try their biscuits and gravy.
They have a wide range of dishes,  for french dip sandwiches,  such as beef dip, pork dip, turkey dip, ham dip, lamb dip, pastrami dip, ask for single dip, double dip, or wet.
They do tuna salad, cheese sandwich. And made to order peanut butter and jelly, Sandwich.

<review>It was nice to finally be able to sit down and eat somewhere. They have nice, covered outdoor seating, someone to bus tables and super clean restrooms available. They didn't have any breakfast available but still, a good selection of eats. The counter service was fast and friendly. Portions could be better.

Great flavor! The bread is soft, the meat tender, the aujus is delicious. The potato salad is perfect, and the coleslaw is spot on. Everything was 5 stars, even the snap crisp of the pickles!  I will come again!</text>

I had the lamb double dip with swiss. So good added a pickle and a pickled egg... I didn't like the egg as it picked in beet juice not dull brine but that my own taste so I'm not knocking them for that. The lamb was moist and had very little gamey taste. I will be back to try my favorite pastrami one day.< /text>

The outdoor (pandemic) dining is quite nice. The food, well, you know. And if you don't know, you have to try it. It's the OG downtown place. Right up there with the Pantry.</Text>

It doesn't get more authentically Los Angeles than Philippe's.  This place lays legitimate claim to the invention of tthe beef dip sandwich (I believe them).  Grab a double dipped beef with a macaroni salad and a cold cola.</text>

This is a fun LA classic that any Angeleno needs to visit at least once. At more than 100 years old, Philippe’s still attracts crowds with its delicious sandwiches (my personal favorite is the pastrami). It is particularly popular before Dodger games and the lines can get pretty long but the staff is efficient at keeping things moving so don’t be discouraged if it looks busy.<//Review>

It was good seen it on multiple TV shows the beef is really good melts in your mouth. The only problem I have is the portion size feel like it's too much $ what there charging for that little sandwich. But sandwich was good.<//review>

<review>Sorry, this was not as good as people have made it seem. The staff was nice and helpful, but original, double dipped roast beef sandwich with swiss cheese...I only ate half and threw the rest away. It just did not have a good taste and was quite a disappointment after the long line/wait. It was plain, bland, tough and dry. Even the spicy mustard could not help. Try   it for yourself and you decide.<//review>< pictures>

All the sandwiches are excellent but I think the lamb is the best in town. Toss in some purple eggs, pickles, and custard for desert along with a cup of delicious coffee that costs 46 cents. Check out the candy counter for old school favorites like Boston Baked Beans and Black Jack chewing gum.<//text>

This is a landmark in downtown LA. Known for their roast beef dip. Comes with coleslaw. Lots of beer choices too. Very rustic, sports bar-ish without the 50 blaring TVs and obnoxious loud fans. A great place for a family meal.

Clean restaurant and clean bathrooms.< /text>

Sandwich is ok tbh. Small and not really cheap besides the sides. Tuna is better than beef in my opinion. Just an old and original restaurant. Try one time sure but second time no thank you.< /Review>

< Review>
This place is an LA Landmark known for it's amazing French Dip sandwiches. They also happen to be a terrific place to grab breakfast while in Downtown. There is free parking, great staff and a fun atmosphere. The place is full of amazing Los Angeles vintage photos and  memrobilia.</Review>

<Text>Oh my goodness what a wonderful nostalgic visit. I literally have not been here in 40 years!! (I'm only 53 ok!🤔😁😂) in any event it was wonderful. I had a pastrami dip & my hubby had the roast beef dip. Soooooo good. Staff was great considering it was crowded. I couldn't believe they had the phone booths that you can sit & close the door!  Great atmosphere.  If you've never been here it's a must! It has not been there just over 100 years for nothing!!!</Text>< pictures>

<text>Have lived in Los Angeles for 40 years. Finally had a chance to try Philippe's this morning. What a disappointment. Sandwiches are bland. Overpriced. Very small portions. No wonder why the place was empty and had no customers. It's mainly just a tourist trap.

Would never go back.

Would definitely not recommend.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Highly recommended. Although I usually avoid blue cheese, I have a strict rule of accepting the advice of the people from whom I am buying food. When the lady suggested the crumbly oddity for my lamb dip, I hesitated for a brief moment before agreeing. As is usually the case in these situations, the employee was right. The blue cheese goes very well with the perfect lamb sitting atop the soggy roll. For those who enjoy drinks other than water with their food, the prices for hot tea, coffee, iced tea or lemonade are ridiculously cheap. Another important thing to mention is that they use quality paper napkins. More often than not, I find similar eateries using what amounts to tissue paper for napkins.

Sandwich was soooooo good. I got the one with fried chicken and it blew me away. My only complaint is that it was so hot in their store. They have a nice area to sit and eat, but with no AC or just better fans it's hard to sit and enjoy. Would definitely go again for take out!< /text>

Consistently delicious! The pickeled beets were really good and the bread was fresh. I loved my tuna sandwich on a french roll and the pastrami looked so good! I heard it was delicious!
I like the outdoor seating arrangement they put on place for Covid guidelines. Its really nice and clean.<//Review>

This place has a great beef dip sandwich! Flavorful and served on a delicious French roll. And if you eat in, you can enjoy the atmosphere and nostalgic decor! Good location on the edge of downtown; don't worry, they have their own parking lot.<//text>

Theine may be long but the wait is never too long and the food is always delicious and made in front of you! Great beef dip!

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Classic for a reason. Got a double dipped beef dip sandwich with jack cheese. The french roll was firm enough to suck up the au jus, yet it still had a nice fluffy texture on the inside/light crisp on the outside. The beef itself was simply seasoned (which for me was a plus because roast beef sandwiches can easily lean on the salty side), and the temperature of the sandwich allowed for the cheese to not over-melt and get too gooey/messy. Overall, the simplicity of the sandwich lends to its deliciousness. It knows what it is, and is proud of it. The vibe of this place is kind of old school, yet in that endearing way. Kinda like if you’ve been going there for years, and there is no expectation to be hip enough or fancy enough to eat there (lots of modern places give off this vibe). Overall, I definitely recommend to sandwich lovers/comfort food lovers!<//Text><userid>103965955659439129121< /userid><name>Luke Barbosa</name><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVD55pkinYuWe0pQBteZTJSB2RNCfOApf6VVas=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

Nice atmosphere (Dodgers game on T.V.) great food on the menu (lunchtime and breakfast) We had the excellent French dip pastrami and beef.  Macaroni salad, coleslaw, jalapeno, salt n vinegar chips, with a brownie!< /text>

<rating>5</rating><Review>One of the great LA treasures. Prices are still incredibly affordable and the quality of the food is excellent. All of the dips are worth trying but I tend to sick with Beef dip. The salads are all worth trying but I'm partial to the potato salad. Be sure to find s booth to eat in rather than one of the open tables!</Review>< Time>

< Review>
I've been to both and like cheesesteaks in philly they both claim to be the first and the best.

The other one is both better and....at least feels older.
Phillippes' is great if you're at Union Station and missed your train so dart over to get something more than a pretzel, but any other time I wouldn't go there - they're meh at best.

If you ever have the chance to go inside too it's basically a tourist attraction and didn't keep any old LA charm it might've had when it began.</Review>

This place is one in a few I like the sandwich and the ice cream so much it tasted much better than a jersey Mike shop or a Subway shop not nowhere near comparison. Overall they're signature sandwich are amazing. The employee and the restaurant itself was outstanding the Sawdust felt like I was in a Texas BBQ pit, tables always clean, employee are very kind and interactive.</review>

NOSTALGIC! That's what comes to mind when I come to this place. This place is an L.A. landmark. The dipped sandwiches are their staple. I get the lamb sandwich, double dipped, with a side of pickled beets and pickled hard boiled eggs. But they have many other options, not to mention their homemade desserts. I never regret stopping by. If I'm within a 30 mile radius I'll drive to it. Going to the Dodger game? Make it a tradition, and stop here to grab a bite. The place is buzzing with excitement. Staff is friendly and upbeat, not to mention the cute hostesses. But this place takes you back to a better place. Parking  is great, and nice views of the Los Angeles area. This is a must for anyone visiting us from out of town. Make yourself a favor, and stop by. Pics below to make your mouth water. Enjoy when you go.</review>

Between the energy, the price, and the quality of ingredients you would be a fool to skip this place. It's a gem and worth the stop and wait. Go for the double dip beef on french with some cheddar and you won't be disappointed the slightest. The slaw was nice and vinegary. It all went down smoothly with some $.80 ice tea.<//Text>

< review>
Our dear friend introduced us to this gem and we couldn't be happier. Went twice in the past month. First of all, it's BYOB with no corkage fee. You bring your own wine, beer, and liquor - as many as you want. The food is fantastic and the service is even better. The lady server (sorry, I forgot her name!)- is the sweetest EVER.

We've tried almost every dish and it tastes genuinely home made. My personal favorite was the lentil soup. SO GOOD.

Also, I left my wallet there last night & they kept it in a safe! SO SWEET. They truly care about their customers.

Love this place and recommend it to everyone!!</review>

The sandwiches we bought were all cold. It reminded me of a sloppy sandwich you would get at grade school. The service was slow and horrible. The lady who helped us, who extremely rude, and I felt she disrespected my dad. He asked for a slice of pie, and before he could say what kind, she barked at him, “what kind?!”. My dad said, “Pie... apple”. She turned around and responded with, “Its called apple pie, not pie apple.”
For 3 sandwiches, 2 pies and 2 salads it took her over 5 minutes.
The pie was amazing, and that’s the only reason I give this place a 3. I think it’s still in business because of the nostalgia and tourist that come here. I took the bait, never again. Walking distance from grand central and Olvera Street.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My trip with a fellow salesperson lead to lunch at this iconic venue, stand in line and order a la carte then sit at communal tables on short stools (reminded me of grade school) but the sandwiches were awesome as was the cole slaw, pickle and lemonade (wish I had room for dessert). There were two other highlights, the varied customers were not only sharing tables but talking to each other (not all on their phones) and the bathroom was outstanding (light, clean and stylish).</Text>< Pics>

<Text>An iconic restaurant with tasty sandwiches.  While in the Los Angeles area, this restaurant is a definite must.  Double dipped sandwiches, potato salad and even pickled eggs.  Yum.  Don't forget the cole slaw.  Have it as a side dish or pile it onto your sandwich for a special treat.  For the vegetarians, try a cheese sandwich! The sawdust on the floor and the phone booths adds to retro atmosphere. A great place for lunch with friends or for out-of-towners stopping by.</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1n-vUdqwLli_IbSZH_pRtUNvQ5djJPvWlERM_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOOHtA6ZCI3_mLOb9M5MgtjoKgm77ThCJsQKj7J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsZ1vExI9n1Tdg98wQLmSmMuRnb1PLo0hFw_mO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwZLYO0rsTppkpr4ZwbobTcL98E2v1M-a9SaiW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkzYXJd4T09Za8tv_Ya4L1Lnzv5mfdR56U-XFR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJcz6pIoLx5-dpza_c4wFQkp5hVw_18GqaCitZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfPun4gZVajExkV6smxEJLWKfYNmKlseeWywdS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Amazing place!

It has a very classic atmosphere to it. You walk up to the counter to place your order, you seat yourself anywhere that's available, and the line often stretches through the dining area sometimes out all the way to the sidewalk! The sandwiches are contenders for the "best sandwich ever" award. It's a French Dip because you can order a side of the sauce that is created in the sandwich making process. Their presentation is so unique - it's no wonder they've been around for over a 100 years!

• HIGHLY RECOMMEND •
If you are ever in the Los Angeles area and want a damn good sandwich, treat yourself right with a trip to an iconic sandwich<//review>

What's not to love, this place is an institution - has been around forever, along with a lot of long-time staff, so you always see a familiar face to order from =).

Pro-tips:

If you are entering from the parking lot side and come down the stairs, don't feel the need to line up right there --  there are multiple lines, one in front of each cashier along the counter, so feel free to spread out!

Beef with American cheese is the best sandwich imho, and ask for extra jus for dunking 😄

If you've never had the spicy mustard, be careful, a little goes a loooong way (but do try it, it's delicious, and you can even buy a bottle of it to take home)

There is plenty of seating around the corner from the food counter, so you don't have to worry about finding a seat right in the immediate counter area<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>The best french dip in town by far. I did a comparison with Cole's one day. Philippe's is much better. I like going to the counter and ordering my sandwiches with a side of pickles. You find a place at one of the many tables. You might meet some interesting people. Come before going to the Dodgers games.< /review><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

<Review>This is the sandwich shop of all sandwich shops. The food is great the atmosphere is causal fun. The customer service is great. They have a ton of options for everyone to pick something from. They have a plethora of side dishes to choose from. They have two parking lots one behind their building and another one across from it. So plenty of space. They have two levels of eating as well one on ground level and the other upstairs. If you have a big group they have you covered by having individual group rooms. It's definitely a good place to eat.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<text>I had been wanting to try this place for quite awhile. I had a pastrami french dipped sandwich.

I paid around $12 for a cold, small pastrami sandwich with way too much horseradish sauce on it that it upset my stomach.

The bread wasn't that great either and the dipping sauce was a kind of disgusting cold salad dressing.

If I had it to do over again I would go to Arby's (a better French Dip) or Subway (better value and footlong).

My first experience, just gross. Possibly overated. The employees are very friendly though.</text>< Pictures>

The best French Dip in L.A..its not even close. Its a must stop if you train it by goldline from Pasdena on the way to Dodger gane or USC game or heck just to go stop in anytime you are in Chinatown or downtown area. Its more than worth it.< /review>

< Review>
still awesome after all these years. French dip sandwich, pickle egg, chilli, pie, everything is good. I personally love the lamp one with Swiss cheese and always get it triple dip, but it can get a little too soggy, so for those who don't like it like that, double dip should be your limit. and don't forget to add a little of their own mustard. it has a real kick to it in a good way, like wasabi. they're still open for take out during the pandemic and they also have an outdoor area for those who really want to sit down and eat.</Review>

An iconic eatery steps from the Los Angeles Union station serving pretty much the same menu as the day it opened October 1st 1908. If you are in the area this year on October 1st , their iconic French Dip sandwich is only $1.10 in celebration</text>

Overpriced tourist trap that's very full of themselves. Got the regular beef dipped. It was ok but TINY. I don't know if it's a new COVID rule to make them so small or if this is the way they have always been. Pickled eggs have decent flavor but are ruined by the fact that the eggs are over boiled.< /Review>

This place has been a bucket list stop for me, for quite sometime. I finally had the chance today to visit Philippe's, as I am a self proclaimed connoisseur of beef dip sandwiches.

Our visit began bright and early on a Saturday morning, we just happened to be in town for an event. As we entered, we were greeted with the nostalgic feeling of old Los Angeles, and the aroma of roasted meat.. Mmmmm. The menu was pretty basic for lunch, mostly dipped sandwiches, with all types of meats. There was a vast array of other tasty treats including puddings, pastries and salads in the refrigerator box under the counter.

We got down to business right away, because the lines were minimal, which isn't the norm according to regulars. We decided to share a meal, so that we would have room to eat at another local favorite later.. lol. On the menu for us was the "double dipped" roast beef sandwich, dill pickles and a side of macaroni salad, and a couple of frosty IPA's on tap. We really wanted to order one of everything, but as I said, we needed room for another place near by. The sandwich was served split for us, and presented nicely with the kosher dill pickles. The macaroni salad was served as a generous helping in a side dish. The roast beef was tender, the French roll delicious, and the macaroni salad on point. And OMG the pickles ! We basically inhaled our food, it was soo delicious !

All and all, this was a great experience that will be repeated again in the future. My only advice would be to sit somewhere other than where the line forms. I felt the people basically breathing down my neck, as they salivated over my food. And every other patron must have been sick, as there was a lot of damn coughing going on way too close for comfort.<//review>

<text>This place is amazing! A friend saw this place on the Food Network Show Diners, drive ins and dives and we had to try it. We came on a Friday during the day so it wasn't too crowded. At first glance it looks sketchy. It's in a strip mall and roads are unfinished but inside it's a different story.

The food: Absolutely delicious! I had the La Camaronera sandwich (basically a fried shrimp sandwich), fries and fried oysters. It didn't even need any salt it was flavorful and great< /text>< username>

The Spicy Mouth Waterin sandwich was delicious. Had the right amount of batter on the chicken, but could use a little more sauce and spice. The Dutch Crunch bread was amazing. Loved it.< /Review>

An ICON, and a MUST-STOP.

Classic, original French dip sandwich in downtown LA. Where celebrities and the downtrodden rub elbows at communal tables with business men and tourists.
They used to be cash only, but now they accept cards and that ups the convenience.

My “go to” is the double meat, single dip, with Swiss and lots of their signature horseradish.</review>

Brought my daughter here for her first time today, and was my first trip in a couple of years.  Get you dip sammich 'wet'.  Cake was good.  Pickles are awesomely good here as well.  I tried the baked apple and it was very old school simple and perfect. Great experience and made a great memory.</review>

Lived in LA my whole life, never went to Philippe for breakfast. It was a good solid breakfast. Not gourmet but good. They seem to serve their French dip sandwiches at breakfast time too, if that's your thing. They take strong COVID precautions.<//text>

This is an LA landmark! We've been coming here since the early sixties, and they never disappoint. Philippe's is a must after a Dodger game. When you stop by, I recommend getting your sandwich "double dipped"< /review>

Like an old school Chicago deli but it's been around longer than them. Lots of great choices on the menue but your first choice has to be a French dipped sandwich, kosher pickles and a cold beer. Packed before Dodgers games. Not so much mid week off days after lunch crowd.< /text>

My husband has been here a few times mostly during lunchtime. Today he recommended this as our breakfast place. I ofcourse was very much looking forward to finally try the famous Philippe The Original. I took a few minutes to look over the menu before making my decision. My husband, he went with his favorite and usual, the beef dip "single dip". A  delicious and savory prime beef on a french roll dipped in their authentic "jus". I wanted a breakfast item, so went with the veggie Omelette. It was light and the veggies were perfectly cooked. I was pleasantly surprised that it had sliced cherry tomatoes. The Omelette came with potatoes and I chose white toast since we also ordered biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were pretty good. The gravy was also good, had minced sausage in it. Which ofcourse made it even more tasty. Overall I enjoyed our breakfast. The restaurant and food both did not disappoint. With so many selections, I'll be looking forward to our next time.</review>

Came in for my first time. I was skeptical because I'm not a sandwich person.
We ordered a double dipped beef, and a double dipped NYC Pastrami. They were amazing. Honestly the best tasting sandwiches I've had.the flavors and texture were amazing. I can't wait to come back.
I loved the interior it's like a deli that's stuck in the past, they still have newspapers and phone booths, a cashier that sells candy and other things.
If your in the area...even if your not in the area check this place out, it's worth the drive.</review>

This is one of the gems of LA. The sandwiches here are really good and pretty famous. As an Indian I was not too impressed with the food. But maybe because this is more American style.
There are a lot of seating here because there is usually a lot of people.
The service is fast and very friendly.
It is a very old restaurant, so the respect is there and i would recommend that you try this place.<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>As we entered, we were greeted with the nostalgic feeling of old Los Angeles, and the aroma of roasted meat.. Mmmmm. The menu was pretty basic for lunch, mostly dipped sandwiches, with all types of meats. There was a vast array of other tasty treats including puddings, pastries and salads in the refrigerator box under the counter.

On the menu for us was the "double dipped" roast beef sandwich, dill pickles and a side of macaroni salad, and a couple of frosty IPA's on tap. We really wanted to order one of everything, but as I said, we needed room for another place near by. The sandwich was served split for us, and presented nicely with the kosher dill pickles. The macaroni salad was served as a generous helping in a side dish. The roast beef was tender, the French roll delicious, and the macaroni salad on point. And OMG the pickles ! We basically inhaled our food, it was soo delicious !

All and all, this was a great experience that will be repeated again in the future.</text>< pics>

I had heard all the hype about Philippe's The Original and being a big roast beef and brisket fan, I made a visit. I can say it was and is the most amazing Roast Beef sandwich. Get it double dipped and add cheddar cheese to it. The only thing I can say is that although they are generous with their beef portion, the sandwich could be about 50% bigger to curve your appetite. Don't wait another minute if you haven't been. Amazing sandwich.<//text>

I'm currently in a tacoma so I'll be brief. The Carnitas are scrumptious, Al pastor is good too. Fresh squeezed lemonade is a must. The Burrito was yummy and enough to share.

If you would like a knock your socks off kind of experience for date night. Chef experience is it! I surprised my husband for his birthday we took bright line then hopped in a 5min uber to KYU. Impressed would be an understatement. We sat at the bar with great service and enjoyed every course to it's fullest. Things would come out looking a tad crazy until you taste it. BOOM! You are hooked!! Everything we didn't finish we took home for lunch the next day. Our kitchen didn't do the place justice. Ha!

Please open soon, we can't wait to come back.<//text>

<Text>Great place to go before taking the Dodgers Stadium Express from Union Station. They take a little while to prepare everything but the food is so satisfyingly good. Beef dip on a French Roll, double dipped, is my go to. Hits the spot every time. I can easily eat two.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating><user_id>109572026171811900697< /user_id><Date>1557459490875</Date></record>

I love Phillipe the Original. The sandwiches are do delicious and the au jus, IMHO, is the best I've ever had. I was there for breakfast for the first time and know that I will be back. How do you say know to biscuits and gravy? An LA classic.< /Text>

Came here a couple times. Nice spot to share some apps and have a drink. Lots of fresh options, with interesting flavors. I recommend the crispy rice and sashimis nice and flavorful, as well as all the veggies - kale ceaser, avocado salad, cauliflower, and mushrooms etc. Will be back to try more menu items!

Only complaint is that it takes time to receive your food. So just make sure you aren't in a rush.</Review>

The food is not much to rave about .... it's decent ;not good nor bad, however definitely bad in the restaurant pricing ... not worth ten bucks at all... The customer service and waiters are horrendous . You have a poor man waiting in a cart waiting for customers to finish to collect the food. The environment feels pressured to finish to eat. The woman behind the counter are extremely passive aggressive and rude.

Were not organized at all when I came go pick up the food and it was lost in the mix of things until someone found it. Once I started to complain about how could it be lost I was silenced by someone behind the counter.<//text>

<review>Lamb double dip, Maytag blue cheese on the side, any soup of the day, any side dish and a glass of that great Cabernet Justin, anytime of the day just sets things to be all right.

Philippes the Original is a place that blows our taste buds. Service is great and fast...but let me tell you about the food. My gosh it is so yummy, we had a couple French Dips (Lamb & Beef) with a cup of French onion soup on the side. Paring it with a Epic sour IPA and a chocolate pie is the best way to go!! Oh and don't forget that pink pickled egg, yes, it looks kinda out of the ordinary but Yuuuuuummm it was amazing! Never change Philippe, thank you.< /Text>

You line up, order from the counter and on of the servers hand makes and dips your sandwich, slices your pie and fills your coffee. There's a variety of meats, cheeses, and the option for a double dip if you want your sandwich extra wet.

They also have have a great breakfast if you get there early enough, a wide selection of pies, salads, and drinks. It is almost always extremely crowded, although during off hours you can sometimes walk right up and order.<//review>< response>

< review>
What makes this a classic when everything they serve is so simple I wondered. Every aspect is good- nothing is taken for granted. The pickles, the sandwiches- the breads, the meats, the sauce, the ice tea, the lemonade. Why can't more places get everything right? And they even have their own big parking lot down town. Respect.<//review>

<text>Beef sandwich was GREAT!!! This place has been here, I think since California became a state. Okay, not that old but, it's been here since the 1930's and still going strong. Food is great and the atmosphere will take you back in time. The saw dust on the floor is swept up every night and new saw dust put down. I'm going for their HUGE breakfast tomorrow!!!</text>< pics>

<Review>Everyone loved this place (except me) I do not like soggy bread @ all. If my friend would've ordered my sandwich dry or juice on the side I would've been happy with it. There are always lots of people there & they boast about the place & order extra to take home. I'd say it's a place to see & eat. 4 sandwiches, 2 can sodas, 1 slice of cake - $54.?? You might find your name carved into one of the bricks</Review>< pictures>

They also have numerous delicious pies, breakfast, pickled things, and plenty of community style seating. Great prices, especially on beverages. Seating upstairs and down, a candy counter downstairs. I recommend taking a dip to go after you're done.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5uEsG25qWY-jkkVXy9xotTjpGy-NR9eOtN-7K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Response>

A LA landmark and classic, you can never go wrong with Phillipes. From the waitress' in their timeless outfits with their polite and helpful attitudes to the high quality of meat and bread used, every sandwich here is an absolute culinary marvel. The hot mustard is truly eye opening, the pickles crunchy and the macaroni salad is still made the way grandma made it. Definitely a top 10 LA experience.</Text>

Be sure to ask for the double dip when ordering your sandwich.  Bought a bottle of the HOT mustard to go.</text>

who does not LOVE Philippe. Food is always good, the salads and tapioca pudding...yumm! The customer service is great, from the people behind the counter taking your order to the staff out on the floor making sure you have all you need and keeping the place clean. This is why Philippe is still around and will continue to go strong.
If you have not tried it, hurry, you will be happy you did.<//Text>

I think I will not go there have meals again. The food taste not very well and I wait for a long time. I ask the waiter some questions and he looks a little impatient. An unhappy meal time.< /Text>

Great sandwiches! Great side dishes. & Great beer selection. The ladies & gentleman behind the counters are really nice, they have a really friendly vibe going on in this old school cafeterias/dinner joint. Can't go wrong in this place, enjoy...< /Review>

<review>Always so delicious 😋. Friendly staff, clean   tables, reasonably priced. Don't forget to stop by the old fashioned candy counter on your way out! You can't go to downtown L.A.  without eating here. French dip sandwiches, beef, pork, leg of lamb, pastrami, turkey & ham all on fresh, crispy french rolls. Tons of salads, potato, macaroni, coleslaw, pickled eggs too. And, don't get me started on the pies!!!?<//review>< Pics>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>It was good. It's an icon in Los Angeles for many years. Reasonable prices. Compared to other similar places in the area. Conveniently located to Union Station. The sandwich we got was good. The waitress that service had a little bit of an attitude. Which I could not understand. Which they gave refills on the iced tea but that didn't happen. But overall it was a positive experience and I would definitely come back again. Lots of train memorabilia in the restaurant. Good to look at.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Absolutely hands down best French dip and in my opinion the best sandwich period. The meats are super moist and tender and full of flavor. All the sides and desserts are fantastic as well. I've never had anything there that wasn't good. I have to eat there every time I go to LA.<//Text>

Pair that with the hot mustard and prepare your taste buds for a culinary delight!  Along with that I had two picked eggs, potato salad, three iced teas, and a slice of carrot cake.  I hit this place up once a year with some buddies on a road trip and they hit it out of the park every time!  If you haven't been, do yourself a favor and get your butt to Philippe The Original.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

A historical institution, Philippe's has been making french dipped sandwiches since 1908. The roast beef deep is my favorite, and getting it "wet" has the French roll cut in half before being dipped in the juice from the roast beef. The house horseradish mustard packs a punch, and is available to take home on the way out (and in local grocers)<//text>

What can I say? It's only the best French dip sandwich ever. Pork is my favorite, but the lamb or beef never disappoint either. Always double dipped. The macaroni salad is always just right. I've been coming here for decades, it's like stepping back in time. The waitresses still dress the same and provide some of the best counter service around. If you've never been, it's a must see.</review>

<text>You're hungry, you want a roast beef dip. You want a 1950's flair? Here it is. This is one of Los Angeles's iconic restaurants! Family owned.  Free parking (unheard of in Los Angeles).  The best dip sandwich, potato salad and friendly patrons.  Family style seating! All ADA friendly.  If you're serving jury duty downtown, this is just a DASH away for lunch!< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
I first saw this place on Food Network's "Diners Drive-ins and Dives" many, many years ago. As soon as I finished the episode I would come here one day and slay the hot pastrami sandwich! Many years later I moved from the upper Midwest to the sunny sunny state of CA, near the bay area, no where near this restaurant. By happen chance my parents moved to the SD area and so while driving down to visit them found the perfect excuse to stop in at this establishment. Needless to say, the sandwich did not disappoint. I am pretty sure that I inhaled the sandwich so fast I'm not even certain if I tasted any of it...regardless, it was very enjoyable and I would definitely make a trip back when I am in the area.</Review>

The dips are delicious. We really enjoyed the beef and lamb. The macaroni salad and lemonade weren't amazing but a nice addition to the meal. The chocolate cream pie was great<//Text>

<review>If I lived in Los Angeles, I would come here once a week. A coffee for $0.50 in 2020; the birthplace of the dip, and friendly service from the ladies behind the counter. A visit to Philippe is a must when in LA. Go single dip or double dip. Wet tends to make the bread soggy too fast. Breakfast is delicious as well.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

The original and the best. The lamb and beef dip were incredible. Meat was tender and juicy and packed with flavour. This would be a favourite spot of mine if I were a local. If you passing through. Stop for lunch or dinner. You won't be disappointed!</review>

< Review>
When a place has lasted since 1903, in a foodie town, you know it's good. The menu is simple. The food is on point, well flavored and made right in front of you. The line moves quickly and the workers are not phased by anything.< /Review>

One of the jewels in LA's crown. It's really amazing historically. It shows so much Americana pertaining to the rail system as well as other infrastructure. All of this you can look at while enjoying a french dip sandwich and a piece of pie. Who doesn't love history and pie? 5/5 from me. MUST visit if you're new to the area or are visiting Chinatown.< /review>

One of the oldest restaurant in Los Angeles and it still kicks today. It has some of the best French dip sandwich’s ever. Highly recommend coming.</Review>

<review>Im a lifelong fan n customer of Philippe's.
Lamb, double dipped with a side of slaw... yummmmmy

Theres so much history in this building, and its a mini museum.

With Covidiot rules, no inside dinning, but parking lot has been set up with a tent.

<text>This place is amazing.  I went there for the first time during the day of the dead walk on Olvera Street and I was not let down.  I got the original french dip, a lemonade, and a pickled egg.  Service was good even though the place was packed and everything was delicious.
If you are in the area then I recommend stopping by here for a meal.<//text>< date>

Like Cielito Lindo around the corner, this is another LA institution, dating back to 1908. But I'm not from LA, I haven't been eating here since I was a kid, and I don't have the rose tint of nostalgia. The signature sandwich - well, It's a good beef sandwich - much improved by adding the mustard. You're eating history as much as you're eating a sandwich.< /text>

<Text>There is absolutely no excuse that you can come up with to not go and eat at this gem. A long time stable for L.A Dodgers fans. The sandwiches are a grand slam. Double dip that beef. And try the bright purple pickled eggs. Excellent fast service. Sit down and have a bite and a chat with one of the old timers that have been going there since they were knee hight to their grandpa.

<Text>Probably more of an occasional stop for tourists now than a regular haunt for locals due to the relatively steep prices.  The good coffee was a bargain, though.  Regardless, the classic, iconic offerings were uniquely savory as expected.  The timeless interior setting comforts like a well-worn glove.  Will return if I'm in the area.< /Text>< time>

<username>Joan Evans</username><Review>No frills, homestyle restaurant with friendly service and good food. In town only for a couple of days and wanted some tacos. Ended up patronizing on National Taco Day - go figure! I had 2 carne asada tacos (steak). The meat was flavorful and juicy and the toppings, cilantro, fresh onions and fresh lime juice provided a perfect touch. The freshly made and served tortilla chips while waiting were a nice touch. Would patronize again.< /Review>< Rating>

been going there over 50 years , looks the same but of course things do change as well. $8.99 for the beef sandwich I remember $2.00, all the older faces behind the counter are all young faces now, the hot mustard no longer in the ceramic holder but a plastic squeeze bottle , I think I go there now for the memories more than the food, when it's was my mom and dad and two younger brothers, when we were a family</Text>

A Los Angeles classic. I've been going my whole life, and it never disappoints. All of the food I've had there is good. I tried the pastrami sandwich for the first time on my last visit and it was stellar. I recommend ordering a "Beef Double Dip" if you can't decide. Add some cheese and apply their in-house mustard yourself for a unique taste. The lines look long but they move pretty quick. It's a neat place were all walks of life come together.</text>

Hasn't changed a bit. Yeah, the prices have gone up over the years, but it's still the same place to me. Single dipped beef dip and macaroni salad for the win for me!<//text>

<Review>We were looking for a Taco Tuesday deal and we found it!! OMG, these tacos are soooooo delicious!!! The restaurant is colorful and makes you feel happy and you can enjoy your tacos inside or take them to go! They are made with corn tortillas and the meat is delicious! We tried carnitas, pastor, and pollo. The salsas that accompany them are fresh and flavorful too! The servers are attentive and we really enjoyed coming here. If I'm in town... I might be back next Tuesday!!! Thanks for making such delicious tacos!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>Known as the inventor of the French Dip sandwich - Philippe's Dip Sandwich is a French roll dipped in "jus" and piled with your choice of meat.  How wet do you want it? "single-dip”, double-dip” or “wet”?  Also serves breakfast, salads and pie by the slice.  The roast beef in the beef dip was tender and the single dip was just right for me- be sure you add the signature mustard - it makes the sandwich- but not too much! (it's HOT!)</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5</Gmap_id></record>

The sandwiches are always fresh and delicious. If you're hungry, request the extra meat it won't disappoint. And if you're thirsty, definitely get that Arnold Palmer.</Review>

Their potato salad is wonderful and all of the cashier's are super nice. I love seeing them all dressed up in their Dodger gear on game days!! There is also a lot of old baseball memorabilia, mostly specific to Dodger stadium, making the shop sort of a mini-museum.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Preserved its name as an old-fashioned diner in Chinatown. The taste pays tribute to its legacy. Original beef french dip sandwich did not disappoint and the Pastrami is just as good. It is surprisingly affordable. Location is accessible and just a walk away from the Train station.<//Text>

First time here, the lines are outrageous at first glance but they tend to move quickly. I got the beef dip ($8.50) and it was GREAT! Didn't try any of the sides but they have plenty to choose from. Also their Dijon mustard is really good, if you like it really strong! Definitely would go again. They do not take card, only cash; however, there is an ATM available.</Text>

Long lines but we'll worth the wait. I had the lamb French dip with the potato salad. They have desserts, plenty of seating. Everyone enjoying their sandwichs. Staff uniforms  decor & ambiance make you feel like you went back in time.</text>

<Review>Whilst on our most recent trip to LA my husband had been looking forward to having an original French dip.
I can't say anything was amazing at all.
Bread wasn't fresh, meat was okay.
I had a tuna sandwich. Wasn't nice at all. Again, bread was stale and the mix was too acidic to eat it all.
Considering we weren't from LA, and it was obvious by my accent, you'd think a friendly smile or friendly service would be offered. No. The staff were rude, and the food was very over priced for what it was.
It won't be on our list of places to re-visit.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><userid>109881194903601711941</userid><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

What a joke! This was a horrible experience gratefully never will come back.. the place is not beautiful. atmosphere lacks during the night. service is rude and the prices are too high for the 2 seconds it takes to prepare tasteless shameful food. Gross French dips ! Pathetic.. save your $ for some lovely

There is a sign on the door that says cash
only and it points out that there is an ATM
inside the restaurant.  What it does not
tell you is that there is an extra $2.25
fee to use the ATM.

The dining room itself contains wood tables
and stools and wood shavings on the floor,
which provides  slightly rustic atmosphere.
There are ample tables and booths available.

The food itself is delicious.  The portions
and prices are reasonable.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Place was phenomenal!! It has such a cool feel to it! You will have to wait but the food comes out as soon as you order. I got the lamb double dip with potato salad and a pickled egg. The pickled egg is a must try. Loved this place and you can explore Chinatown while you are there!</review>

The sandwich and dip was fantastic. I had the pastrami with a slice of cheddar and the beef dip on the side (I'm a messy eater as it is). I was a little hungry after as I didn't get sides, but supremely satisfied with what I just ate. Will definitely return for more!
They take credit card, having a parking lot, plenty of seating, and really great food, perfect for a quick bite< /text>

What can I say it's Philippe's. A family tradition for over 40 years. Best French dipped sandwiches and much more. Don't forget to try the breakfast they offer. Delicious.<//review>

Relaxed place to eat lunch alone or with friends.  The beef dip sandwich is to die for.  The bread is fresh and tasty.  Roast beef is so tender in the sandwich. I have one side of my bread dipped into au jus, perfect flavor.  No need to add anything else.  Service is always quick, unless you have to wait in line.  Everyone knows this is the place for good food, so the wait is always worth it!< /review>

<review>This place is always great. The lines can be bad sometimes, but it's always worth the wait. I get the same thing I've been getting for years: beef dip (double-dipped), a side of potato salad, and a slice of blueberry pie. And a lemonade. It's hard to beat it. On a busy day, parking can be a bother, but plan ahead, leave plenty of time, and enjoy.<//review>< Pictures>

A restaurant that has been around for over a hundred years! And, it's still packed every day, up the stairs and out the door. There's only one Philippe in the world and you can now have these delicious sandwiches shipped. The place where French Dips were invented by a police officer and a sandwich maker. A place where a glass of iced tea is cents (sense) and not dollars. Near the historic Olvera Street which boasts fresh pan dulce and the oldest adobes in the nation. Also near China Town. Make Philippe a visit on an historic day in downtown LA and you won't be sorry!<//text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><text>Phillipe's is just so good, and so very traditional. They have the “French Dipped Sandwich” that is the specialty of the house and can have it with either roast beef, roast pork, leg of lamb, turkey, pastrami or ham served on a fresh baked French roll which has been dipped in the gravy of the roasts. Swiss, American, Cheddar, Monterey Jack or Blue cheese can be added and you can get it not dipped, does once, or twice! I recommend twice, it is just so good. I also suggest getting their mustard there which has a kick to it with Horseradish in it! Definitely recommended.< /text>< GmapID>

<Rating>5<//Rating><resp>None<//resp><user>115563194054974246207</user><Review>Oh my god i love this place.
It is soo my kind of place.
Great staff. Good parking.
Safe. Great place to eat.
Only complaint it is getting pretty pricy to chow down.
Love to dip my ham and jack in a bowl of chili straight.
I live in Las Vegas and everytime i come to L.A. i try to hit it at least once.

As of January 2020 the food in the pix was a tad over $25
Still worth going to. Maybe just not as much as used to.

When i lived in the valley (about 35 miles away) i would go here at least once a month< /Review>< username>

< Review>
I have to tell that I'm really thankful to my fiancee for bring me here, we love our lamb and blue cheese double deep sandwich, with potato salad and pickles (for him) I just enjoy my sandwich with a drink. There is a very good service, nice people and the installations are good too. When I go downtown LA is a must Philippe's, Chinatown or Olvera st. Goodies, accessories and good food.<//Review>

Great place to spend a memorable lunch with your son. Food is very good - historical deli menu. But the atmosphere is what is I enjoy the most. I bit pricey and the lines are long but you can't pass on the experience. I enjoy bringing my son here when in the area.<//Text>

Holy mackerel I came to this place 25 years ago and it's still standing strong. You know it's a good sandwich when you remember it all these years later. I had the lamb single dip and savored every bite. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I tried a pickled egg because I haven't had one since I was a kid and that too flood my memory banks. If you're in downtown LA, want an amazing sandwich, and nostalgic atmosphere that's reasonably priced come to Philippe's and enjoy one of the best sandwiches you'll ever eat!< /review>

< Review>
Good place for a quick bite to eat.  The place feels like you're going back in time.  They have sawdust on the floor.  I ordered their popular French dipped lamb sandwich. The lamb meat tastes juicy and tender. The dipped bread is a little soggy and on a salty side.</Review>

First time here, the lines are outrageous at first glance but they tend to move quickly. I got the beef dip ($8.50) and it was GREAT! Didn't try any of the sides but they have plenty to choose from. Also their Dijon mustard is really good, if you like it really strong! Definitely would go again.</text>

< Review>
This tiny little restaurant in a strip mall is easy to miss but I've had consistently excellent food there on repeated occasions.
It's clean, quiet, family run and with excellent and very friendly service.
The food tastes incredibly fresh and is not swimming in sauce like in other Chinese restaurants.
We really enjoyed the following on repeat visits: wonton soup, orange chicken, salt & pepper calamari, crispy green beans, oyster mushrooms with baby bok choi.
This has become our family go to Chinese restaurant whenever we're in the area.</Review>

It's a lunch counter, just like it always has been. The sandwiches are bread and meat, like old times. The drinks are charged per glass, like old times. The food is simple, like old times. It's a place I go to about once or twice a year, and really dig it. Try the place out. See what it was like to eat at a lunch counter in old LA. Don't be too picky, soak up some history and enjoy.</Text><UserId.>116134841014535669439</UserId.>< Rating>

Love the French dipped sandwiches. I always get the beef with coleslaw, lemonade and a pickle! The ice cream is soft and delicious. I ate it the desert before the meal and it was perfect.
It gets crowded sometimes, but there is plenty of seating. The lower floor is more homey and welcoming with the floor and wall decor. The top is a stark contrast.
Add a bit of the brown sauce from the squeeze bottles if you want a bit of a spicy kick to the sandwiches.</Text>

Classic L.A. spot. The pickled eggs are a must have, along with a pickle and a beef dip - double dipped! Washed down with an ice tea. And a slice of boysenberry pie for dessert.</Review>

Philippe's is so delicious it'll make you forget how pricey it can be. The food is comforting and always consistent when you come back. Philippe's has two parking lots to accomodate, and plenty of service lines. There is much to be said for a simply made meal to be delicious, memorable, and worth it.
This is a restaurant that used to be great, and is still great currently. If lines are a bother, I suggest visiting late at night or right after they open. And having a coffee is tradition.
This is a place for the locals, as some menu items (french-dipped sandwiches), may not seem like much unless you know which extras and changes to ask for, which is not apparent to new visitors. When in doubt, add the horseradish mustard to enjoy the magic that the rest of the Angeleno's are raving about.<//review>

Been coming here for years and their food has never let me down. The lines at the deli counter get crazy at times, especially when the Dodgers are playing. You see a sea of blue in the lines. I come here because I have business in the area, and I keep coming back because they have great, simple but well-prepared food.< /text>

I love the food here but they definitely need to work on the decor and bathroom situation. It's generally all men working here and not very feminine friendly in the restroom. I get the Caprese and my husband gets The Godfather and we both are always pleased. The bread is amazing!< /Review>

Try the beef stew; beef and vegetables in their natural juices - and it's $4.  Try anything else and you'll love it all.  Counter ordering (about 10 stations), they slice the meat you order for the famous dipped sandwiches right off the bone, dish out your sides, and handle your payment.  Don't miss this.

I just had a spinach mushroom onion omelet.  $9.75. with it came a half a plate of perfectly crusted hash brown potatoes, two large pieces of toast with butter and jam, a side of salsa, and a cup of coffee, amazing.<//review>

<Text>understanding that this place is a treasure if lines are long its normal. today on Easter I was happy and surprised not to wait long. Instead of normal beef with American cheese dipped I chose ham it being Easter, chili no beans, potato salad, tapioca pudding and lemonade. It was all just right.<//Text>< Name>

This is definitely worth a stop for one of the original French-dipped sandwiches.  It's a decent sized sandwich costs about $8.50, and the flavor is great.  It's kinda comparable to a dipped Italian beef sandwich that you'd find at a Portillo's in Chicago, but this one uses bread with a harder crust which keeps the au jus from leaking out as you eat the sandwich.  Cool vintage atmosphere in the restaurant too.<//Review>

<Review>Still pretty good, but inflation has set in there,hence the 4 stars.  The beef dip sandwich is now $8.95. Ok, I'm old, but seems like not too long ago it was $6. I always order the pickled pigs feet which remains reasonable at $3.15; and coffee for $.46. They have free parking,which is a plus.</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Review>This is an original establishment that never changes! Delicious sandwiches, I always ask for more dip juice on the side and get a dill pickle too. Fast even when there is a line and nice to walk to Olvera Street after we ate.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Rating>5</Rating>< Date>

A must visit diner in LA for that authentic diner experience. Get a double-dip roll (they dip the bread in gravy, then freshly cut meat off the bone to make your meal). The prices are good and the staff are super friendly and helpful. There's free filtered tap water available & clean public toilets.< /Review>

Opened in the 50's, this place serves some wicked beef sandwiches.  The speed of delivery is a little slow some times but the wait is worth it.<//text>

Great roast beef of course. They have their very own way to serve you at their counter. It's kinda like magic, before you know it there's the tray with food in front of you. Their prizes are still reasonable, and there's plenty of sitting no matter how crowded it gets. So it's always a pleasure to come in and have a reliably good meal. Just make sure you give yourself  time to find good parking which can be a little difficult.</review>

I worked with Swiss beef twice dipping, pea soup, pickles, and potato salad. I recommend them all. Most like a meter, you should be willing to not stumble into this article. The floor was covered with sawdust. Great place to burn an hour before or after to go to the station. In this exciting historical place, food and experience. I love the back of the room to assemble the train. Plus, many desserts to choose from past and present. This place becomes very busy and lunch before or after sports competitions, so be prepared to wait, but it's quite worth the wait! I totally recommend this place.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

The original French dip. Extra parking across the street. There are lines here all day but they move quickly and it's totally worth it anyway. I've been coming here since the 1970s with my father and the food hasn't changed. Great historic artwork too.< /text>

A must place to stop. I have been going here since the late 60s. Whenever we were anywhere near Los Angeles we would stop there for a meal. My grandparents would drive in from Orange County. They had been going there since before they moved there when the 101 freeway was built. Dont let the rustic appearance scare you away. There is always a fast moving line up of people waiting for a delicious sandwich.  It could be locals, construction workers, or people stopping by after an evening at the theater. The food is delicious no matter what time of day. Don't miss out on this little slice of local LA pie. These are the best sandwiches I have ever had.< /Text>

<Text>This is something happened to me in past november , i never received a response from this company, you judge ;
I was traveling on my own in California this November when within the first week (11/16) I went to a known place near Union Station in Los Angeles called Philippe the original.
I asked for breakfast, and then at the moment of paying she passed my credit card by the card strip reader but she told It didn't work, is normal because in Spain we use the credit card pin pan, so I gave her my Amex.
After this she started to ask me, what now sounds me strange doesn´t your bank call you in Spain( i didnt tell her I live in Spain) if you use your credit card here?  I replied, I don´t know, they don't use to, sometimes... the conversation ended there.
The next morning I woke up with some strange charges to my credit card, Universal, WBtour for 178 $
So I called my bank, they informed me they have been blocked my credit card because someone suspicious activity has been detected. The bank informed me about 25 rejected attempts of charge for a total amount of more than 2000$. The card had been blocked the would send me a new one.
After that I called to Universal and they send back the ticket bought with my credit card. There were under a name which I google and after research  I found was the woman who served me at the cafe.
So I called the Universal and Wb in order to stop her to use some tickets bought with a cloned credit card but they couldn't do anything, so the police made a report.
My point is, usually these people do this because they are sure tourists don't report it till they arrive at their home, where authorities are incapable to do nothing.
I don't know if you see as professional anything we can do to stop this kind of crimes,  to sue the company which has this person employed.< /Text><UserId.>103208015192776997537<//UserId.><Response>None</Response><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Philippe’s is a family tradition going way back. Most of the time, pre-Dodger games, but a lot of “hey we’re close to Philippe’s “ stops, too! Ordering is easy and the (mostly) women behind the counter preparing your sandwiches are quick and efficient. The sandwiches are delicious, whether dipped or (dripping) double-dipped.

The tables and stools are sturdy and clean (unless it’s busy). There’s a great little counter where you can buy souvenirs, chocolate bars and gum.

A small parking lot is available in the back, too.</Review>

An "Icon" of sandwiches in the L.A. area. There are places you don't miss when you visit certain cities, Philippes is one of those places. Been going there for 50 years and it's still the best in town. So if you're in the L.A. area, on business or vacation, make sure you stop by Philippes and have a French Dip, you won't be sorry, that is unless you miss it, then it'll be a crying shame!< /Review>< Pics>

Been going there for over 55 yrs. Flavor still good, salads still original flavor, meat portions on sandwiches less and dipped sandwich and ham too salty! Afternoon servers much happier and friendlier than morning shift</Review>

Great LA tradition located walking distance from Olvera St and Union Station. The lines can get really long during prime lunch time but they move quick and it is worth the wait. French dip and Turkey dip sandwiches are great! And their hot mustard is awesome!< /review>

Ancient place in the middle of downtown LA, where the menu items have changed little over the years. The star of the menu is the double dip French dip, on a homemade French roll. Be sure and get a side of either potato salad or macaroni salad. And don't forget dessert, their pies are wonderful.

As you sit on the saw dust covered dining room, try the hot mustard. If you had a cold before you came in, if you overuse the mustard on the squeeze bottle, you won't have a cold leaving.

The coffee is cheap and good, so is the beef stew. They also offer a hearty breakfast.< /review>

Delicious and historic. The walls have reviews from the days of Pan Am. Had beef double dip with Swiss, split pea soup, pickle, and potato salad. Would recommend all of them. Like most deli counters, you should be prepared to order and not stumbling over items. The floor is covered in sawdust? Great place to burn an hour before or after visiting Union station.< /text>

<text>I like taking folks new to LA here. Philippe offers a wide selection of items at reasonable prices, and trust me, the food smells AND tastes delicious! I remember when coffee used to be less than a dime but even at 45 cents per cup now, it’s hard to beat it.  There’s ample seating and parking. Service can be a little slow though; you place your order, pay in cash, and then wait for your order. Sometimes, they don’t serve the next person until the customer before receives their order.< /text>< response>

<review>Damn decent pastrami sandwich. I don't remember getting a pickle with it or if you have to ask, but that would have made it so much better. This place's format for ordering reminds me of katz deli in New York, where you go up to one of the many lines and place your order.</review><user_id>112113435910028963519< /user_id><resp>None< /resp>< username>

I'm a big connoisseur of French Dips but I hate to say this is not the best one I've ever had. To me, the Au Jus had a weird taste to it. Ordering was quick and easy and it looks like they have a lot of good stuff on the menu but I had to try the original French Dip. Seems to me it was a little pricey for just a sandwich with nothing to go with it.</review>

<Review>Ehh... way too much hype!  Parking is limited and hard to find.  Long lines.  Tough finding a table during lunch time.  Friendly service.  Great coffee cake.  Way too pricey for the amount of meat in the sandwich.  Flavor... I've had way better at a less famous place.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

The best roast beef sandwiches in the world but you must get them double dip. I have been coming to Philippe's ever since I was a child. My dad use to take the family there when we would go visit our family in Azusa and El Monte. Very fond memories.</review>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Wow. Get the classic French Dip with as much au jus as you can take. Genuine LA experience. Put the incredible horseradish mustard on sections of the sandwich as you eat it to adjust your experience in real time. Get pickles and macaroni salad with the sandwich.

Love the French dip! Its an LA must eat for locals. (Be sure to pick a line where the sandwich maker doesn't like to talk) those lines are faster.  I miss philippes

If you’re in LA, Philippe’s is a MUST!!  Near Grand Central Station and the original birthplace of "El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles del Río Porciúncula” aka Los Angeles.  In same area (easy walking distance) as Olvera Street, Little Italy (mostly supplanted by LA’s large Asian community) and a host of great ethnic eateries.  Back to Philippe’s - the best French Dip on the West Coast.  Was, per local legend, a speakeasy during Prohibition.  Don’t expect to be “served”, but order at a long high counter, wait a few, pick up your order on a tray, sit down and enjoy!  A classic much missed since Phoenix has nothing to compare.  I don’t think the interior has changed much in the past 50+ years.  You can even make a call from one of the half-dozen real phone booths (watch the movie “Airplane” if you’ve never seen one of those).<//Text>

Still can't pick a favorite between the two Udon's, it all depends on what you're feeling that day. Definitely recommend the Beef tataki - insane! Make sure to have it with the tomato.

Have to go back to keep trying the rest of the menu. Up next the Sea Urchin Udon & Mentai Squid Butter Udon</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Great location with lots of long tables and booths. Order at the counter and take your food to a table.  Super close to union station.

Tasty Beef dip, potato salad, dill pickles and a soda $16.21 w tax

Yummy! Pastrami was very good.< /text>

As always this place doesn't dissapointed you, they had been serving the same menu for more than a 100 years and going strongly.
Always recommend their famous French Dip sandwiches, their magnificent pies, their pickled eggs and of course in the morning, one of their traditional breakfast.

Clean restaurant. Order at the counter and bring to one of the many tables available. If you want pancakes, get there before last call for breakfast-I think around 10:30AM. Had the single dip turkey on rye. Loaded it up with the signature mustard; it was the bomb!! Coleslaw kicked and pickles hit the spot too. Grab a beer and wash it down! If your nose is a bit stuffed up, just add more mustard to your sandwich and you’ll be able to breathe and smell anything from a mile away. The Original-nuff said.</Review>

An LA institution! Always long lines, but worth the wait. Lots of options for sandwiches, sides (pickles, pickled eggs, cole slaw, potato salad, etc.), and desserts. Consistent quality. Pies are decent, too. For some reason, I always find it easy to over-order and over-eat here!< /review>

Not to say the food wasn't good,but rather basic. Wasn't offered the sauce on the side either so just got what amounted to a soggy bun with roastbeef and little added flavor and just didn't have any "wow that's great" moment. The place was great though and was some great merch to buy if ya wanted is the food again,to me,was just basic.Not to discourage anyone but rather encourage them to go and decide for themselves as it is an experience nonetheless 😉< /review>< UserId.>

The absolute best in LA. If you visit LA, this place is a must. Get the lamb or beef dip! I've been going here with my mom since I can remember, and I'm 43 now, and still the best.<//text>

<review>A Los Angeles institution! Be sure to ask for sandwich to be double dipped or wet. Buy their mustard to enjoy at home.< /review>< Pics>

< Review>
Good sandwich, but my favorite is their really hot mustard and the overall vibe of the place. Definitely a staple in LA dining.
We went there for a lunch on Sunday and it took us only 7 minutes to get the sandwich to go even though the place looked pretty busy at first sight</Review>

The original and the best. I had the lamb double dip. Excellent. Try to go during off hours as it can fill up, but worth the trip any time. Friendly, community atmosphere. I love the long, shared tables. Even when busy, it doesn't get too loud. We were still able to have a good conversation, even when the place started getting packed. The brownies were out of this world as well.</Review>

Philippe The Original is a Chinatown establishment. A must visit spot for French dip lovers. The place has a great old timey vibe that I enjoy. This place does get packed but it's worth it.<//text>

Phlilppe's is an institution in Southern California they make the best French dip and pastrami sandwiches I have ever had. I normally get the French dip but today I got the pastrami sandwich. There's usually a long line but it's well worth it.  If you get the sandwich to eat there they double dip it but if you are going to take it to go, they single dip and give you the sauce so that the sandwich is not soggy by the time you get home.</text>

<Text>Nostalgia brings me back here but honestly the food is overhyped and overpriced.
I've been dining here 40 years, the sandwiches have gotten smaller as the price goes up . They use to pile the Cole slaw on the plate today there was barely a serving spoon size and it was dry. I'll keep coming back...maybe once a year.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5<//Gmap_id>< user_id>

<Text>This is not a fancy place, no bells or whistles on the food. Just a good meat sandwich dipped to your liking. Order it as wet as you like it. Decent beer on draft and a great place to grab a bite defore the game. As you sit or stand eating your sandwich you feel like a part of L.A.'s history .<//Text><UserId.>117343989047899626501< /UserId.>< rate>

Preserved its name as an old-fashioned diner in Chinatown. The taste pays tribute to its legacy. Original beef french dip sandwich did not disappoint and the Pastrami is just as good.< /Review>

<text>OMG. Best food ever. Try their lemon meringue pie for a total surprise. If you think you have had good pie in the past, this will dissuade from that illusion. Theirs is hands-down the best you will ever eat. The BBQ is delicious. One reason it is ALWAYS crowded is because all of them agree with me. 😀</text>< pictures>

Always the same and never disappoints. Prices seem to be rising, but such is life. Go here to fill your belly with good food made right, and buy a bottle of hot mustard on your way out.</Review>

What can one say? This place has been part of my life for most of my life.
An institution, a classic, an icon.
Double dip always, sure the cole slaw is a little watery, the pickled eggs a bit hard, the macaroni salad somewhat bland.
Everything is GREAT!!!!</text>

Such an experience for a restaurant that has been in business well over 100 years! The food was good, nothing over the top amazing but everything I ordered was delicious so don't have a complaint there. Anytime I'm going to visit the city, I think I'll have to stop here.</Text>

They accidently drop a LAPD foot beat officer's sandwiched in beef juice.
They offered to make him another one
But the officer was in a hurry took it
Next day officer showed up and ask them
To drop his sandwich in the juices again
Thus thank a (LAPD ) Officer  next time
Your coming from Philipe.</review>< Pictures>

Sides include fresh potato salad, macaroni salad, coleslaw, dill pickles, pickled beets, pickled eggs . . . hot bowls of beef stew are wonderful for the cooler weather.  Desserts include apple pie, cream pies, rice pudding, egg custard, baked apples.  Beverages include lemonade, beer, coffee . . . Philippe's is a great place to eat before a Dodger game or theater event at the Music Center.  Free parking is available in two parking lots which can be entered easily from Ord off of Alameda.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place is an L.A classic and should be declared a historic landmark!  It's been around since 1908!!  The french dipped sandwiches are what they are best known for.  Personally I like the lamb, but all the meats are lean and good quality and they don't skimp.  You can also order with extra meat if you are REALLY hungry.

Whenever I'm in the area, I gotta get my Phillipe on!<//text>

<Text>They have best French dip sandwich. The lines can be a little long and slow. So if you're in a hurry this is not the place for a quick meal. Also seems like their prices seemed to keep going up and up every time I go. It can get pricey if you add any side or drinks. Spent almost $13 for a sandwich,side of mac and can of coke. If you're not from the area I would still recommend you treat yourself and try it out. Can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.<//Text><rate>4</rate></record>

<text>This place is great! I needed to stop somewhere to get a sandwich to take on my 10 p.m. train ride with me. This place was a great place for that! They have dip sandwiches of turkey, beef, lamb or pastrami. I have the pastrami sandwich it was wonderful! They also have many side dishes and salads. I would highly recommend this place for a sandwich even if you're not in the area to take a train! It is open till 10 p.m. and also has very comfortable seating and a unique train Motif with lots of model trains.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5< /GmapID></record>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I love Phillipe's French Dip sandwich. Additionally, the motif of this restaurant is pretty cool, the building being a converted school from the early 20th century. The order counter and dining area are set-up like an old-school (yes, pun intended) coffee shop. It's the consistently delicious food that keeps me returning.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I was not impressed I think this place is over rated and over priced for the tiny sandwiches they served. I went with two of my buddy's and got three beef dips and the woman gave two of the beef dip  Au gui and one with none. When I went to get some the women told me that it was  Complimentary and she only gave the two was because she was being "nice"   . I spoke with manager and was not confident that she would do anything about it but I could make better beef dips at home from the grocery store deli. Will not be going back.</Review>

Great spot for an appetite of any size. Certainly worth going back to. The place has an awesome atmosphere. Kinda of like a cafe in Phoenix that I enjoyed.</text>

<Text>Philippe's has been a reliable source of fantastic sandwiches and cheap coffee for 100 years. This is an icon, and any resident of LA has to familiarize themselves with sawdust on the floor, hot mustard, and meat juice all over their fingers. Parking isn't great, so take the train to Union Station and walk a few blocks.</Text></record>

Legendary LA staple! My gf brought me by in the morning, and I just loved it 👌👀❤️. It’s spitting distance from the LA Amtrak Union Station, so great spot to eat if you are traveling or coming in town from somewhere.

There was a short line, very friendly staff, huuuuge space w several rooms and all kinds of historical local memorabilia on the walls. It was a lot of fun to see. Loved the row of telephone booths, and the openness of it, early in the morning it is full of ppl on their way to work. Seemed a lot of locals love having breakfast here before work, rather than home.

Still sawdust on the ground. Not my style, had to ask what that was, looked weird to me, on cement floor, but am foreign, so not culturally relevant to me, and it does seem that everyone else loved it.

The food was fast, nice size portions, and very tasty. Gulped it down in 5 min.

People here are friendly. Many seem regulars, and very interactive. Others more reserved, but overall a friendly vibe.<//review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>It was good, great pastrami,but like most places these days, its a little pricey for the portion size. I guess its more about a turn-of-the-century eating experience and LA history, But I won't be running back soon, rather head to the Original Pantry Cafe. Much better food, and portion sizes with that same old school LA vibe. The food there is actually worth the price.</review>< Pictures>

Transport yourself back to 1910 in Los Angeles with this cafeteria style style French dip sandwich.  The pork is the sweetest and fattiest, the beef is just succulent and the lamb is savory.  A little potato salad and a lemonade with a piece of pie and everyone is happy. Truly delicious after all these years.</Text>

<Text>Truly deserving of its status. The French dip is as good as advertised, and the atmosphere is so dope. Quick, bustling, and efficient, yet never feeling cold or rushed. Two stories with plenty of places to sit and grub (plus the feel of hallways and different rooms is an oddly nice touch). Sandwiches are excellent, sides are bomb, desserts are delicious, even the lemonade is above average. Only complaint is parking but I mean come on, it's L.A.</Text></record>

<Text>Philippe The Original is a part of my pre-game ritual whenever I'm on my way to Dodger Stadium. My usual order is the roast beef (double dipped) with a pickle and macaroni salad with a lemonade. You can't go wrong with the potato salad or coleslaw either ... great old-fashioned deli fare with a historic vibe! It's especially fun when 3/4 of the crowd is decked out in their Dodger gear! If you're there early for a day game, the breakfasts are as dandy as Sandy! Really, if you love tradition, the Dodgers or just great old time L.A. eateries, Philippe The Original is the boss of them all!!!< /Text>< Pics>

An LA icon.  The dipped sandwiches are amazing whether you like the Beef or other options.  The potato salad and other sides are delicious.  Just the overall experience speaks to a different era that modernity lacks.</review>

It was fun, you sit at some picnic tables to eat, and it was pretty busy. Overall the price was reasonable and less than $4.00 for each of the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.<//Text>< rating>

<review>It took a long time to make it through the line to the counter of Phillipe The Orginal French Dip sandwich. It was well worth the wait..

The decor is sparse, old model trains, pictures of long forgotten people, decades old news paper articles, and hooks on the wall to hang your coat and hat.. Thw seating is open family style, there is always a space for everyone and if you want some privacy make a trip upstairs or a both on the ground floor. Fresh sawdust is thrown on the floors every morning to give that old time flash back salon feel...

Phillipe is a 111 years and still going strong from the first day it opened its doors.

Grab a fine glass of wine or a craft beer and taste the flavor that put them in the map..<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>A Los Angeles classic dive with great history and even greater sandwiches, Philippe's has been an occasional stop for me since I moved to Southern California in the early 1980s. In all that time, it has changed remarkably little, and judging from the photos on the wall, it hasn't changed all that much since its founding.

I almost always have the lamb dip, they slice the meat right off a bone. But they are best known for the beef dip, being one of several restaurants with a plausible story and claim to being its originator. But don't neglect their sides, they do a decent egg custard, pickled eggs, pies, salads, and more.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Another iconic institution in downtown Los Angeles (walking distance from Union Station) serving beef sandwich dipped in an in house “secret house.” Nothing fancy but just good old sandwich done right!

<Review>Historic Los Angeles cafeteria... Great pies, HIGHLY recommend the beef dip or double dip, or get it wet if you want your quality French roll drenched in awesome au jour beef juice. Make sure you grab a few sides like macaroni or potato salad or even a quality "soup of the day". They carry local beers from local breweries as well as soft drinks & other various snack items to pair with your French dip sandwich. Take a trip down memory lane with Philippe's the Original...<//Review></record>

Amazing food and experience in this fun historic place. I love the train collection in the far back room. Also lots of candies to pick out from past and present eras. The place gets super busy during lunch and before/after sporting events, so be prepared to wait but it’s totally worth the wait! 🤠 I totally recommend this place to everybody.<//Text>

Only the sanwiches are really good. The mac noodles and mash potato are basic good. Banna pudding pie is really bad 👎. Table Mustard is super spicy Hot - so test it before using. Over priced but still a really good Sanwich and a must when visiting L.A.<//Text>

Beef dip and pie was $17
Beef dip was ok. It was bland and pretty small.
The pie was chocolate cream but just tested like cream.. It was probably the worst chocolate cream pie I've ever had.
Eastside market has way better dip sandwiches and I think anywhere has better pie.<//review>

< Review>
I used to come here many years ago.  It is ok now but not like it use to be.  The sandwiches seemed really small now.  You have to ask for basics now.  So when you order a beef dip, the au juice does not come with it unless you ask, and there is a charge for it.</Review>

<review>They have the best beef sandwiches ever. If you like you can have more juice added by saying single dip double dip or wet. Sometimes you can get a good hi there I got the pecan pie and my wife which was very good and I recommend you try the potato salad it's the best. I'm glad to say that now they accept credit cards. Their cup of coffee is the best and I recommend it if you want cream in your coffee ask for cream and they will add it for you.< /review>< Pictures>

Yes it's gets busy but the line moves quickly. Yes it's still "authentic" and "diverse" but reasonably priced.  Yes, it's very good.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Love this place. Frozen in time. Sawdust on the ground. I try to eat here whenever I am in LA. Worth going out of your way for. If soggy sandwiches are your thing, this is the one to compare all others too. I don't care if they invented the dip or not, they perfected it. Warning, the mustard is very delicious, but go easy, it will clear all your sinus!</Text>

Didn’t like it much.. nothing out do the ordinary. It was our first time eating here and we were kind of overwhelmed because we didn’t know how to order. The macaroni salad was disgusting, didn’t even eat one spoon of it. The sandwiches were good but not as good as you’d expect with how popular this place is. A bit overrated< /text>

It's a classic, but it won't be the best beef dip you'll ever have. It's an institution and it's fast. Sawdust on the floor. Gotta try it once. No real options for vegetarians. None for Vegans.</Text>

Really incredible. cozy warm vibe with upbeat music so you won't fall asleep. Had the pork belly to start, was absolutely to die for. The waitress was friendly and laid back, pretty fun to engage with. Had a fried gnocchi dish and we also got the special fish stew.</Text>

This place is overrated probably because it's relatively cheap.  The meats taste pretty good, but after all the hype I expected more meat between the breads.  The breads are not the freshest and unless you ask for a dry sandwich they are soggy.  The only way to ask for au jus sauce is for them to dip your bread in it before putting the sandwich together.  They don't serve it in cups.  The service is so-so, a little rough around the edges.<//Review>

Really good sandwiches. I always get the burrata. The bread is quite good, but so is what's inside the sandwich... so maybe they should call it "Not Just About the Bread"  ; )</Review>

The food came out quick and hot! You definitely need to try the honey dewit cocktail, amazing on a hot day!

<pics>None</pics><Review>It was pretty good. I'm always down for a aujus dipping sandwich(I think this is the proper name??). They offer many other menu items. This place is like a deli on steroids, and I love this type of a restaurant. The main sandwich they offer mainly in 3 ways dipped: dry, half, or full. I ordered full. I wish I got half because I'm not a fan of bread being slightly soggy.
Restaurant set up was fun, lots of peanut shells on the floor too. Plenty of chairs and tables, some great high tables, and TV's too.
Great place to eat before a Dodger game.<//Review><name>Marshall Lawrence<//name>< gmapID>

You can’t go to LA without a visit to Philippe’s. Old school establishment with long benches and tables for social eating and sawdust on the floor. Order at the counter and enjoy your experience. Ladies bathroom was beautiful and unexpected in a place like this. Looking forward to going back.< /review>

If you've been here before, you don't need me to explain why this is an amazing sandwich joint.

If you haven't, Here's what you're gonna do:
You're gonna go in there, jump in line, order a Roast Beef or Turkey double-dip with whatever side you fancy and a glass of Lemonade. You're gonna take your sandwich to a table, apply the spicy mustard.
By the time you leave, Phillipe's the Original will be on your "Every time I'm in LA" to-do list. That is all there is to say.<//Review>

< Review>
Even the wet sandwich is not wet enough and they won't give you more to dip your sandwich on your own, but the sauce at the tables is good. Other than that the meat was good and the environment was neat if you like to eat with strangers at the same table or have a big group. The prices were a little high for the amount of food and I would not pay for the amount of drinks you get for the money. Cool place but way over sold by people, seems to just be so busy because people say it's better than it really is. I'd say it's one of those places people go once just so they can say that they've been there.<//Review>

The lines are long but they move fairly quick.
Just know that the lady taking your order is the same person who makes your food. So be patient.
The potatoe salad is delicious. And so is the carrot cake. The macaroni salad in my opinion is just okay.
The pancakes are yummy.
This place is huge so if you cant find seating downstairs just go upstairs<//text>< Rating>

Excellent as always, just like I always remember it as a child, but starting to get a bit pricey, even into day economy.

<username>Laura S< /username><Review>Alright... a lot of people say this place is overrated... NO. No. It's not overrated. It's the right amount of rated.

FOOD:
Pork Sandwich French Dip - $7 - Delicious. I can't eat beef or lamb, so I just get the pork and it's GOOD. It's even good the next day - cuz I only ate half and saved the rest for lunch the next day and STILL GOOD.
Potato Salad: YES. This was so good.
Coleslaw: Not too wet and not too dry. Just perfect.

SERVICE:
Fast. They accept card and they are nice.

AMBIANCE:
It's meant to be look dirty and ranch-like. Peanuts on the ground. Hay on the ground. Shared settings. It's pretty good.

PARKING:
Street

OVERALL:
I like it. The good is great! The price is great! They take card!</Review>< gmapID>

You can get a glass of lemonade or tea for less than a dollar. I think that's a nice little fact.
There is usually a line to order but there is plenty of seating. There is also a second floor with more seating available.
One of my absolute favorite local spots. It's right next to downtown. There is also a parking lot available for customers.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

The best goto for a dip sandwich. They’ve been around for a 110 years and they are still the best. While there can be a line at times it’s to be expected. The service is always fast and the food is always fresh and great tasting. Pricing is fair and they also serve beer.</Review>

Delicious, mouthwatering french dripped sandwiches in a casual settings. Be prepared to wait in line for a while during busy periods, but trust me it is worth the wait. If the sandwich doesn't fill you, they have an excellent range of desserts to choose from!

Service is fast, staff are friendly and helpful regarding the menu. We were not sure whether we wanted our sandwiches dipped so the lady behind the counter put some in a small pot for us to try. She insisted it was good and she was not wrong.<//review>

I don't know what they're trying to pass off as original here.  The original roast beef sandwich soaked in it's own juices was done at Brennan & Carr's, Avenue U @ Nostrand Ave, Brooklyn, NY.

Try again LA.  Original everything comes from the east coast.  Everybody in America knows that.</review>

<text>Came on a Friday and had the tri tip sandwich. It's absolutely delicious especially with the added avocado. They tend to add too much sauce to their sandwiches so I always ask for no 'bomb sauce' or 'season sauce'. Large lunch crowd but that's expected. -1 star because I tried calling my order in a few times but no one answered.< /text><rating>4</rating>< GmapID>

This place is the BEST!!! Get a beef double-dip, there signature home made coleslaw, a kosher dill pickle and a lemonade.  It’s the perfect food!😬.  Lob on a bunch of the proprietary Phillips’s mustard and you will be in food heaven.  Take home a jar of the mustard, it’s also great for a unique deviled egg plate.

I’ve been going here since I was born (don’t remember) but my Mum has told me I have.  Totally Awesome Food!!!< /Review>

Best, best, best Philly I’ve ever had!  Meat is tender and the French dipping make bread soft and flavorful. Are the sides are old school classics and the Banana cream pie was a nice ending to the entire meal. Must try before you die!<//Review>

What a find. Waiting for the Amtrak, wandering around the neighborhood looking for breakfast. Coffee for 50 cents! The selection is wide, maybe I should have had a French dip for breakfast. Don't pass this place up. Staff were very friendly, don't be afraid to ask questions, lots of assumptions.</text>

Order at the deli counter, fairly inexpensive but delicious sandwiches(beef, lamb turkey, ham, pastrami...double dipped, add hot mustard.!) various sides(chili, potato/macaroni salad, coleslaw soups, pickled eggs, etc.), desserts(pie, cake, custard, tapioca, baked apples, etc.), not to mention the candy counter and craft beer(and extensive wine list), and sit at communal tables surrounded by historic pictures of Los Angeles. They also serve a wide variety of breakfasts and coffee.! A legendary L.A. staple since 1908, and inventor of the French Dip.!<//review>< GmapID>

Better French dips than Cole’s. Pastrami is better than the roast beef, but roast beef was definitely good. The pastrami? The horseradish laden mustard? Amazing.</Review>

Good French dip sandwich but nothing terribly special to me. I was never a big fan of the French dip to begin with (a rather straight forward sandwich to me).  I heard about this place being the original and we were visiting China town so we decided to go for dinner. The wife enjoyed her lamb dipped sandwich and appreciated the quality of the meat.  You can call me a heretic but I would much rather prefer a Chicago Italian beef sandwich.</text>

Didn't think I would enjoy this place as much as I did. The Beef Dip and the pastrami are both really good. Not a fancy sandwich, just very simple and flavorful. The restaurant itself is an old, dumpy cafeteria with sawdust on the floor, but the sandwiches are worth going back for. Lines can pile up fast but seem to move quickly.<//Review>

Very nice place to grab a French Dip. I like the fact that I've never been there before but the place still felt familiar. Saw dust covering the entire restaurant floor and deli style counter to place your order. The food was flavorful and the service was quick without a long wait even though the place is crowded most times. Would definitely recommend.< /Text>

We went yesterday, and it wasn't too crowded. My wife and I got two beef dips, a chocolate cake, a lemonade (only 90 cents,) and we brought in Won Kock Chinese food for our daughter and cousin. Beef dips were excellent, and I'm already craving another one. They have a lot of space to handle all the people in there, and a lot of great train stuff and pictures to look at on the walls. If you are in the area, you have to try this place out at least once.< /text>

Had to go to Philippe the original for the history alone. The sandwich was understated, served on a paper plate wit counter service. Best French dip ever. You have to go all the way and get it dipped. Portillos almost has it, but Philippe you are the original.< /Review>< Pics>

Respected LA institution was not a disappointment at all. Funky decor from decades past like a bank of phone booths. Wait was not bad as the were numerous lines. The cashier also puts the sandwich together. Definitely go for the single dip lamb with Jack cheese and extra sauce on the side.<//text>

<review>Terrific place to eat! It's always busy but the lines move pretty quickly. Fresh food every day and the beef dip and coleslaw are delicious! Make sure you try the Chili! You can have them put beans if you wish, I don't choose beans but I do like cheese on top! Their hot mustard is to die for! I put it in my sandwich but don't put too much because the fumes from the horse raddish will go up your nose and hurt! This is one of my favorite casual restaurants in LA. They invented the French Dip here!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Happen to be touring Union Station and made my way over to Philppe's for some really good beef sandwiches. They were excellent! Both the experience of Union Station and Phillippe's felt like being in a time machine, it was so very nostalgic. If you want to feel like you're stepping in to the early 20th century and have some great food then this is your place.<//text>

<Text>The Beef Dip Double Dipped with American cheese is simply the most ah-mazingly scrumptious French Dip i have ever had...the ladies at the counter are always so sweet and quick. The ambiance is fantastic...You feel like you stepped off a time machine and into your favorite eatery circa a time you never knew (unless you did then God bless you) but always familiar and like home. Whenever I am in Downtown LA or driving by in the 110...I get that craving< /Text><Name>Arline Miranda</Name></record>

The most delicious sandwich I have ever eaten! I had never eaten a dipped sandwich before (being from New Zealand) but this surprisingly amazing! The sandwich was simple, stacked with layered slices of beef with a couple of pieces of cheese. A must try for anyone visiting the area.<//Review>

<Text>A wonderful bit of old Los Angeles. My family has been going to Phillip's since the 1920s. I have been going since the 1970s. I have never had a bad meal. The specialty of the house is their French Dip. Choose beef, pork lamb, turkey or ham. Their mustard is amazing. It will bring tears to your eyes.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5< /GmapID><userid>116233420218165537219<//userid>< date>

I don't know if this is the true origin of the French dip but it might as well be, for how good the sandwiches are. They're fast and provide excellent service. Parking is free with limited spaces but in this part of town it's nice to have any type of free parking.< /Text>

Not dining but a massive experience of eating and fun. Unique to LA (maybe anywhere?) a must for tourists. Cheap, so good for families. Simple food but really tasty, and we always get pie! Don't forget there is twice as much seating upstairs!</Review>

This place has some of the best sandwiches since 1908 we talking about horses being tied outside to wait while u but a travel sandwiches.  I was dragged into this restaurant by my grandmother 50 years ago to be able to walk to China Town and then circle around to Olvera Street. You must walk to the city hall take a picture<//text>

<review>This review is only based on the pie, the line, and the comfort of seating. The lines take absolutely forever even though there are four or five of them going at the same time. The pie was bland and the apples were almost raw. The crust was the worst pie crust I've ever had, SO flavorless. While I appreciate the old fashioned nature of the place, I wish they had chairs with box instead of stools. I have back problems and it was hurting me not to have support. It's also just more comfortable to be able to lean back.<//review>< date>

< Review>
Good food but was expecting a lot more from the hype. It’s quality but it was just a meat sandwich. The restaurant itself was cool though, felt the history. It feels reallly local in there, so at first it felt a little awkward, but the staff are friendly. Overall pretty good experience.<//Review>

A very unique experience in ordering an original "dipped" sandwich.  We ordered a ham and a turkey dipped sandwich and shared a half of each.  Prefer non-dipped sandwiches but was good.  Bun was excellent.  Shared an order of potato salad & cole slaw and liked both as well.

Expect long lines (9 or more lines) when ordering; sounds like the normal at all times.  We stopped around 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon.<//text>

<Text>This place is honestly never a let down and brings back so many memories from my childhood. The menu isn't super big which makes this places perfect in mastering their craft. Today I ordered a double dipped beef sandwich and a small cup of chilli and let me tell you if you put the chilli on the sandwich it opens a whole new door of possibilities. It was probably the best combo I have had in a long time.</Text>< user_id>

The pastrami is lukewarm. Chese is cold. And the worst is that IT WAS ALMOST 20 BUCKS. I can't sware, but I would it be the best to at the service. They treat you like your supposed to know whats up, then they throw a paper plate at you. WORST PLACE EVER, Never coming again.</text>< Time>

The original French dip sandwich. My personal favorite is the Lamb with blue cheese. Everything is homemade and worth the wait in line. They also have a great breakfast that I haven't tried yet but will. I originally discovered this place on the Huel Houzer show many years ago< /text>

<review>TIP : One literally gets an entire sheet of blue cheese if you chose this as your add on cheese option. I've never seen so much blue cheese on a sandwich, they literally pull an entire sheet of blue cheese out of foil and put it on your french dip. If you're a blue cheese fan this will absolutely become one of your favorite spots. only .80 cents to add, so worth it.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The very best Beef Dips in Southern California. An excellent choice of sandwiches, side dishes and desserts. A cup of coffee is only $0.45, which is delightful and has a fresh ground taste.

Whenever I am in downtown Los Angeles visiting and eating at Phillipes is a must. Philippe's recently celebrated their 110th year anniversary. There is a reason this restaurant has been in existence for 110 years. Quality is foremost and prices are very reasonable.

This is a Los Angeles landmark. The food is monumental.< /Review>

Great sandwiches and helpful staff. Parking was pretty easy because they have 2 lots to park in and it's free parking. My only hang-up is the seating. I wasn't a big fan of sharing a table with strangers and on a beautiful day like today I would have enjoyed some more natural light inside.< /review>

<Text>Lovely place with a good flair going. It's kept in a 1950-60 style with saw dust on the floor, a metal counter and sports on TV. It's an authentic flair, the personal is friendly and quick. The sandwiches are great but also their salads are tasty. I really enjoy coming here to end a day, grab some dinner and soak in the atmosphere of the place.</Text><gmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5< /gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp><Rate>5</Rate></record>

Staff is really nice and the food is amazing. But every time I come here the  “manager” always makes me feel like he’s discriminating us for our race because he ALWAYS creates an issue for one of my friends. Finally fed up with it, we asked to speak to the white manager Andrew but he refused to speak to us and he sent a random employee to ask what we needed. Such a professional!< /review>

<Name>Raschel Dumbrique< /Name><Time>1567716177249<//Time><rating>5</rating><review>Uhmmm.... Cafeteria style restaurant where you order your food at the counter.. Don't go away, just wait for your food at the counter as they will bring it to you lickety split while your waiting to pay for it.  So you get your food right away.... as soon as you order. That is one of the good things, Fast Service. Having said that, there is always a line.  Depends on what time of day you get there, you could be the 5th person in line or the 28th.  But I guarantee, the food is worth lining up for.  Come hungry, but not too hungry your stomach growls as you wait your turn.  Also, a good idea to go and scope and stake your table as people are always coming in in groups, one group searches for a place to sit while someone else places the order.< /review>< pictures>

Almost always busy with long lines, and a bit pricey, but excellent dipped sandwiches. I usually get either the beef or lamb sandwich. The double dip is perfect for any sandwich, just cuz the single dipped is a bit too dry for my taste. Don't be fooled by the color, the pickled eggs are the BEST and is a must-try item there.

As for parking, the one by the shop itself is small and always full. Alternatives are street parking, or the bigger parking lot across the street. It might be more of a walk, so it may not be suitable for disabled/handicapped people if the handicapped parking is already full. That is up to the individual for judgment.</Review>

I have been going off & on to Philippe since the 70's.  I love the French Dip Beef sandwiches, their salads & the spicy mustard I take home a souvenir of.  My kid sister turns 60 on 10/5 & had never been there.  She is glad she finally went.  Our sandwich maker has a 10/6 birthday.< /text>

< Review>
LA institution for hot meat sandwiches. Solid tuna salad sandwich, potato salad, and coleslaw. Always crowded so prepare to wait. It’s a local institution that brings together a broad swath of people and can be incredibly crowded before and after Dodgers games so prepare. Portions are small so you might want to consider ordering additional sandwiches to share. Counter service that isn’t the easiest to understand as there are multiple lines most of which serve everything on the menu. Cashiers handle the order, food prep, and delivery which is totally inefficient.</Review>

It was okay. Not exactly what I expected considering that this place is supposed to be an icon in LA. Tried the Ham Dip sandwich and couldn't use the dip after one bite. WAYYYYYY TOOOOO SALTY!!! NO EXAGGERATION!! One use of the dip was enough salt intake for a year but the sandwich was okay. I went one more time for the pastrami (w/o the dip) and a dessert and again it was ok. Not worth the travel time it took to get there. Definitely Overhyped but not bad.< /Text>

<text>Overpriced and overrated.. but reminiscent of how grand central and farmer's market on third used to be.. busy even on a weekday. First time being here even though ive lived in la for 25 years.   There is no dip, bread is just soggy.. sandwich can be finished in about 5 bites, 8 if you're on a date. Haha

The Original and The Best!

We tried Philippe The Original  on recommendation from our local friends and it was fantastic, relatively cheap prices, great tasting sandwiches and a unique dining area.

I would not go out of my way to eat here but if your anywhere near the area its a great place for lunch<//Text>

Yes indeed it's the original place for the French dip sandwich. For those that haven't, stop by when you hit Union station, or swing through Chinatown as it's really close.

Go ahead and spoil yourself and grab one with double meat. You absolutely won't regret it. The place is like a weird little time capsule, saw dust on the floors, long wooden benches, pickled eggs and everything!

Also, keep your eyes peeled when you visit, you'll see plenty of Hollywood figures pop in and out.<//text>

Food is decent here. A real popular spot for Dodger fans and tourists. If u happen to want to come here, keep in mind there is always a wait to order your food. The NY Pastrami and Lamb sandwiches r bomb. And of course, ya can't have ur sandwiches without the potato and Mac salads. Make sure to request the dipping sauce when u get ur oder though. Gotta ask for it. They just don't give the dipping sauce to you. 😃< /Text>

<Text>Wow, i don't know where to start...
My girls and I were so excited to try this place after seeing it on Man vs. Food but unfortunately our experience was not even close to what we expected. First of all the sign says nothing about breakfast not being served after 10:30 am on the menu. We were about 4th in line and arrived at 10:35....two separate customers in front of us ordered breakfast and when it was our turn the lady at the counter said breakfast was over at 10:30.  I explained that we got in line past 10:30 and other customers ordered breakfast and got it, so she said I will do it this time only. I didn't feel it was right for her to be acting like she was doing me a favor, when she was letting other customers order breakfast past the time they were serving it. Then, she comes back out and said we don't have enough bacon for both of your breakfasts so we'll give you sausage. After we received our order we noticed other people were getting bacon. Wasn't very impressed with the beef dip sandwich that I ordered, it wasn't bad but in my opinion didn't meet the rave reviews that others give. To top it off my daughter had egg shells in her fried eggs. I'm glad others enjoy it but we will never go back....so disappointed</Text>< user_name>

One of thee best sandwich spots ever! My favorite coleslaw!  I normally order the lamb sandwich with jack/white cheese. They also offer some good beer in bottles. Not so much a bar but, if you like a bit of wine or a decent bottle of beer  with your sammich, then this is the spot! They've got custard, rice pudding, pickled eggs, pie, etc.</review>

Wow what a treat. Such good food. Huge line, almost out the door, but that's a good thing my friends. The eating area upstairs is nice for a big party. The menu is substantial but who cares, you've come for the French Dip. Only downside is you have to ask for ice in your drinks.< /Text>

A great French Dip sandwich. The area is just typical China Town. But they do have their own parking which is nice and hard to find down there in China town. The restaurant isn't anything special but it's clean and good food<//Review>

Have been a customer since 1969 and the experience every time over the years has been great.   The food is so good but the best part of the experience is a always watching the diversity of the customers.  The last visit is exactly as good as the first visit.  Every one should try it!< /Review>

I had been a Philippe's fan for many years in the 60's and 70's, and again in the 90's, but hadn't been back since. Was it the same as I remembered? Yes!!! Loved it...however: did NOT enjoy the traffic getting there. Visiting family here this week, but the traffic reminded me why we moved to Idaho!< /review>

<text>My mother took me here as a teenager over 25 years ago. There's a history to the restaurant that reminds her of her childhood and was the reason why I decided to take her again when she visited. The place is known for French dip sandwiches which are absolutely fabulous.  A must go to place for those visiting Los Angeles.<//text>< gmap_id>

< Review>
While the food is good and the building historic, its popularity has lead to it being crowded all the damn time!!! When I'm feeling in the mood for Philippe's I will swing by and get a sandwhich here. The lamb sandwich is really good. Their pies are also good. The food is a bit pricey though

If you want to come here you best be prepared to spend a LONG time in line. Don't even think about coming here during a Dodgers game because the lines are out the door.

In conclusion while I do like the food here I don't feel like waiting forever for it</Review>

The French dip was delicous. It's a must try when in the L.A. area. I drove 45mins (both ways) from Beverly Hills to try this place. Service leaves alot to be desired. But that's L.A. for you...or any of the big city's i.e. NY, CHICAGO ECT...People just seem to be to busy to be nice. But I'm from the Midwest. Guess we have a more laid back approach.</Text>

A must if you visit LA, I make sure to take out-of-towners here. Try the spicy mustard before you douse your dip in it... It's extremely fragrant. And, get a pickled egg if you like those flavours.<//Text>

< Review>
It's a classic for a reason. The roast beef is of course the signature item and it doesn't disappoint. I do like to add the mustard that can be found at the communal tables throughout the place. Beet purple pickled egg and I am a happy camper. On the down side the mac salad was ok, not great. Oh, don't be weirded out when ordering. You put the money on the tray and the ladies bring it to the one cashier, then they bring your change back to you at the display cases where you ordered. Give 'em a nice tip, they are working hard!< /Review>

Love this place. First time I ate here was after my son's "urban hike" (10 mile hike around the city) with his Boy Scout troop. They've got delicious dips (beef dip, double dipped beef, etc.). There are long lines but it moves quickly. Come early to avoid the long lines. There are communal tables downstairs and more chairs/tables upstairs.

Parking: There's a small parking lot + street parking.<//Review>

My wife and I had the beef and lamb sandwich. They were succulent and delicious. One sandwich made me incredibly full but I still wanted to go get another one. The prices were good and all the employees were very nice and helpful. But overall the stars for me were the coleslaw and lemonade. Both of these were the best I have had since I moved out of the south (and to make it even better the lemonade was less than a dollar). Definetly worth going and I will be going again.<//review>

<text>The best French Dip in town. This classic institution of old LA is where you rub shoulders waiting in line and seated on the long booths. Obviously the roast beef is the first thing you should order. The pork sandwich is great as well. Secret tip: great chili at this establishment, and all the sides are worth the order. Finish the meal with a slice of pie and you're set for the rest of the day.<//text>< username>

Great French dip sandwiches!  Highly recommend the 'double dip' where they dip both top and bottom of the bun in aus jus!  Drinks are less than $1 but are small, and don't forget to put the horse radish/mustard sauce on your sandwich when at your table.< /Review>

Order the double dip in any meats you choose, and the very best coleslaw in the world, always homemade.   The Phillips mustard makes everything in your palette perfect.

Always fun and delicious. Go back in time 100 years (though its first site was replaced by a freeway). This site can be glimpsed in a Charlie Chaplin film called "Police," I believe. Get the French Dip Sandwich. Add tiny drops of hot mustard. Buy a jar to take home. Have some coffee. Have some tapioca pudding. Enjoy the model trains and memorabilia. Be kind to the staff and your fellow diners.</Text>

This is old Los Angeles. The food is excellent. (My favorite is the lamb dip sandwich!) You order at the counter and your food is prepared, by hand, right then and there. There are booths, but try the communal tables. This is a great place to have a meal before or after a Dodger game.</Review>

Old staple restaurant in heart of original downtown right next to Olivera St Mission and Union Station. Everything is Al le cart but reasonably priced. Parking free and good, except at lunch time during the work week as this is a favorite spot for police, fire and most all city, county, state and federal workers. Then there are the dodger fan regulars who are there for meals before a game. Vegetarian meals not their thing, but they do have good salads.</text>

One of the oldest restaurants in Los Angeles & claims to have introduced the French dip sandwich. Place is very reasonably priced & it is about MEAT. You stand in line -it's always crowded. You order & your food is put on a tray. You carry to your table in the large multi room dining area. Great sides & beer. Be sure to take home some hot mustard.<//Text>

<text>A Los Angeles institution.  The sandwiches are simple and done quite well.  While they aren't the best tasting or fanciest sandwiches you can taste the care and quality of the ingredients.   I prefer the lamb dip over the beef dip.  Get the sandwich dipped once and a side of au jus for additional dipping ad you see fit. If you need a bit more flavor or spice use the spicy mustard provided on the tables< /text><rate>4</rate><username>Poy Huang</username>< resp>

It’s an LA classic—and deservedly so! The food is reasonably priced, the staff is friendly, and the food is really good. Get a “double dip” and sides of potato salad and cole slaw. I try to stop by every time I visit the city, and I always bring my friends who are visiting here, too!</Review>

<review>Quite a few reviews for this place, so I'll make it short.  CASH ONLY.

To Order: Proceed to any available carver along the counter; if there are lines, individual lines form for each carver.

Paying: Place your money in your tray.  The carvers cannot touch the cash.  They cash you out at a cashier behind the counter.

Enjoy!</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

<review>You have to try out the French dip sandwich at Phillippe's before you head to a Dodgers game. it's so good. Ask the cashier for a double dip to enjoy the deliciousness of the au jus. 😆It's so good. Their dessert are delicious especially their chocolate cake and I LIVE for their lemonade. Their lemonade is not too sugary or tart it's just right!< /review>< gmap_id>

<text>It's an essential place to go whether live in or are visiting LA. The food is so frickin good and the vintage vibe of the building is awesome too. My favorite thing to order is the turkey double dip sandwich (definitely get a sandwich when you go here) w/ coleslaw that I put on top. Their potato salad, pickles, cheesecake, pies, and puddings are also really good!< /text><GmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Philippe's is a long standing tradition in LA, and not without reason.  Their food has consistently delivered throughout the years.  Best known for their amazing French dip sandwiches, they also provide a variety of standard deli options.

Whether you're heading up the hill to catch a game at Dodger stadium or just in the neighborhood, Philippe is a must.  Here's wishing them another century of success!< /review></record>

Prices have sure gone up over the years, but the quality and great service hasn't changed. Get the Lamb sandwich double dipped. Macaroni salad and pie are also good. Second parking lot accros the street. Tip: each server has its own line so jump in a short one. Good lemonade to.< /text>

<review>I have been coming here my entire life. Back when I was a little kid coffee was only 10¢ and that was in the early 80's. Grew up on the beef double dipped, now I enjoy the lamb with swiss, still double dipped. The original French dip sandwich as invented in Los Angeles! Still has sawdust on the floor.</review>< UserId.>

Decent food to be sure, but from what I had its not worth the hassel. Pretty standard French dip, but with a very long wait time, and a solid price tag. Not the sort of thing that would break the bank, but between the 15 minute wait in line and what I paid for a small sandwich and a side, I was getting the feeling this must be some amazing sandwich. Not so much; not bad, but not something I think I would queue up for again unless I was nearby and it was during a dead period where I didn't have to wait so long.< /Text>

What an amazing restaurant to be! Portions are big, flavors are amazing, and the service was great!

The only down side is that the line up is long... Usually takes at least 30 minutes to get a seat. But it's worth it!< /Review>

Good if you like meat & bread. Avoid at all costs before a Dodger game unless you like crowds< /Review>

<review>Philippe's is the first place I take visitors from out of town, or even those rare few who live in Los Angeles but have never been.  Birthplace of the French dip sandwich and one of the oldest restaurants in town it never fails to please the palate.  It's the kind of place where you might be in line next to the mayor and a homeless person.  On the edge of Chinatown there is ample free parking, but it's also only a few blocks away from Union Station for those who ride the subway.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5<//GmapID></record>

<review>Came here with my bro to try the famous Philippe's The Original. The parking was very ample and the service was quick. Each lady behind the counter takes an order, so pick a line and have your options ready.

They retrieve your food quickly and the prices are very affordable. Went with the single dipped beef sandwich, cole slaw, potato salad, pickles and Coke. Have to come back for the soups and the desserts.</review>< gmap_id>

This place has class.  They start with a simple sandwich menu centered around the dipped french bread concept and decorate that with lots of tasty affordable sides.  Top it off with spicy mustard at the tables and pies for dessert.  Can't go wrong.<//review>

<text>I have been coming here since I was 16, and when I had my first bite for there dipping sandwich and spicy mustard, I was hooked. Tourist just love coming here, celebrities come by and its just good place to have lunch, or hang out with friends and even family. Being that its also a historical restaurant, makes it even more intriguing for those who never been here. The experience is as if your zapped in a time warp, with just ordering up with there women dressed in blue and cash only policy. They have the most amazing desserts, sandwiches, and the coffee is still just cents.< /text>< pictures>

Delicious french dip sandwiches in a century-old location just blocks from the historic and picturesque Union Station and Olvera Street. There are lots of comfort foods from a great potato salad to pickled eggs. Sawdust on the floor, a little gum and candy counter, and nostalgic uniforms of the counter staff will transport you back to a different era the second you step inside. Lines move quickly, lemonade and ice tea are inexpensive, and the hot mustard will clear your sinuses, guaranteed.< /Review>

YUM. The beef. Double dipped. Hot mustard. THE BEST! I have yet to try the lamb but have been wanting too but every time I've been I'm too tempted by the beef that I just end up ordering that. The pickled egg is interesting because it's a very vibrant dark pinkish purple but it's pretty good. I tried their chili and it's pretty bomb. But that mustard, yum! Parking can get a big hectic when they're busy, but this place is pretty much a landmark, a must eat when you're in LA.<//Text>

The beef dip us solid. It's not spectacular, I mean it's meat on bread. I also got a New England clam chowder, which was excellent.

It's walking distance to Union Station (less than 10 min), the service was nice and fast. And I noticed there's TONS of parking.< /Text>

< Review>
What a unique and quintessential LA food experience ! On the edge of the Chinatown/city hall Nexus, this is a sandwich lovers dream. A little bit confusing for ordering, it's an old school kinda joint that has communal tables, booths and sawdust on the floor. All this and parking, too !

Roll was just ok, dip was VERY thinned out, meat was pretty much tasteless because it was cooked too long. I should have went to Portillo's  for an Italian beef, same price, FOUR times as much meat. Well, live and learn. WONT be returning here.......UPDATE.....UPDATE....As of 6-9-19, price went up, $8.95 for a french dip,,,,,But the quality, and portion is still the same!!!!!!

<Text>It's truly my fault I was so excited to go to a place that had dips that when I got there I didn't realize that after  I'd placed and received my order it had no dip they actually apply the dip to the sandwich before they give you the sandwich you can ask for dib on the side but if your used to dipping order on side. I didn't which ruined my whole experience and the place is really packed and really good.</Text>< Pictures>

Visited here while waiting to change Amtrak trains at Union Station. Easy 10 minute walk from the station and quick take-out service got us back in plenty of time to eat before getting on our train. It was 6:30 a.m., but I couldn't pass up the French Dipped. It was great! The beef was tender and the bread fresh (and just the right soggy). Also got an order of biscuits and gravy and some pancakes. Both were fresh and tasted terrific! I would recommend Philippe's to anyone looking for a quick meal from a local establishment.</review>

I've been eating here since I was 6 years old. The biggest change is that they now accept credit cards!

Great sandwiches, great coleslaw, one of the very few places I've found pickled eggs! I wish they made better pickles.< /Review>

I love historic places. This place is like a deli counter of prepared sandwiches and sides, and beer/ wine. I host a book club there once a month. We can have food, drinks, and a comfortable discussion without feeling rushed.</Text>

An LA landmark. The best French dip I have had. So good my grandfather  has me drive Philippe's out to him 2 hours away. Be prepared for a wait and bring quarters for parking incase parking lots are full. But it is worth it.<//review>

Easy to find with lots of free parking which is a plus in LA. Wasn't really blown away by the food as it's basically just beef on bread. Was exactly alot more flavours. Could possible get more value with the same amount elsewhere<//text>

This is an LA institution with remarkably good food and iconic cuisine. It is like stepping into a classic film noir mystery. Fun, tasty, eclectic and affordable. What's not to like? I especially recommend the cole slaw.< /text>

It's a pretty solid sandwich, the lamb was cooked well, perfectly tender. But other than that, it's meat in a roll. Definitely a good stop for a quick meal if in Chinatown. The donut surprisingly was pretty good too.< /Text>

It's legendary for a reason. Great food in a setting that has not changed in decades. They added pastrami a few years back and it is the same quality as the other meats. It just makes the decision tougher.</Text>

<review>We come here for two things: the food and restaurant.

As the creator of the French dip, Philippe's delivers consistently quality food. But they offer so much more than just good sandwiches, their sides (especially the potato and macaroni salads) and pies are delicious also!

From the sawdust on the floor and model train museum in the back room to the old school phone booths and candy counter, Philippe's offers plenty of charm.

Private booths and public cafeteria style seating are both available. I prefer to pull up a seat at one of the long tables and make new friends.

Don't forget to slather a bit of Philippe's famous hot mustard (in bottles on each table and for sale at the candy counter) on your sandwich for the full experience.<//review>< pics>

This place is old school. Don't be scared away by the thin tables and sawdust on the floor. It's part of the charm! Get a sandwich, a side, and a slice of pie. The roast beef is my favorite. Get it double dipped!<//Review>

<review>Its just a solid sandwich. I've always gone for the beef with single dipped French roll. Hits the spot every time. It's not the best sandwich in the world but if you're in the neighborhood and want to experience something historic then, it's the place to go.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjQ2OAwiPtydSLFxR3TiSiM-fUrnNSNFDIdcKO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

I love any of their dipped sandwiches, their sides, soups and dessert. I especially love their split pea soup, macaroni salad, and pork sandwich. Top it off with a 45 cent coffee and a baked apple or tapioca pudding. Don't forget to purchase a jar of their famous hot mustard to take home.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Now approaching 60, started coming here when i was 17, Philippes is still a great sandwich, a great experience and worth every penny. Of course i remember 5 cent cup of coffee, and the beef dip was $2.20 when i first came here, but it is in my opinion a great place to for a sandwich, with some HOT MUSTARD on the side</Review>< Pics>

Amazing sandwiches, amazing vibe. There's perpetually sawdust on the floor yet it's one of the cleaner restaurants you can go to in LA.< /review>

The sandwiches here are legendary. I stop here every time I'm in town, even if it's just for a layover. Always worth the trip.</review>

<review>Double dipped French dip with extra hot mustard. That's how I like my Philippe's. Aside from that the potato salad isn't bad, and drinks are cheap (but come in tiny glasses). Before dodger games parking is hard to come by, and lines stretch the length of the eating area. Try to come when the Dodgers don't have a home game<//review>< pictures>

👏 I've been going there since I was a kid. Right on the edge of Chinatown and Olvera Street Sawdust floors, bench seating, oldest original waitresses, best French dip sandwiches. Try one with real blue cheese 👍  Home of the Original French Dip Sandwich. Historic Place with Cool T-Shirts in an interesting part of Old Los Angeles. Don't miss it.<//text>

Always been good. I've been stopping by for over 30 + years, the wonderful same yummy double dip sandwiches!
Coleslaw, beets, and more...
A great food stop from the past that continues to serve good double dips!< /review>

You're here as much for the atmosphere as anything else,  but the dips are pretty terrific too! Recommend beef dip double dipped on French roll.</Text>

Right in the heart of downtown Los Angeles,  this place rocks! Service is quick and excellent, and the food is better than you can imagine. Who cares about ambiance and atmosphere! If you want a really good homemade breakfast, I highly recommend this place!<//Review>

<user>107278085303597435299</user><text>What can you really say about Phillippe's that hasn't been said?  I ate break feast here for the first time ever the other day.  Super good!  The biscuits were light and fluffy with hearty sausage gravy and some eggs on top.  The pancakes were excellent!  I never knew they made such a great breakfeast.  I don't live in LA so I also had to get my french dip sandwich to go.  I really wish I still lived in boyle heights so I could go here more often.  It's busy in the lunch rush.  I had no issues at breakfeast on a weekday.  The servers are always super nice and helpful.  This is a gem of the LA food culture.< /text>< date>

<text>My usual is the beef French Dip--double dipped--with cole slaw as a side. I add a few drops of their (very) spicy mustard. The atmosphere is casual, with sawdust on the floor. If you forget cash, there's an ATM. Don't miss the room in the back with train and circus memorabilia.<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

What a place!  My girlfriend and I got french dipped sandwiches.  (Hers, turkey.  Mine, beef.) The service is fast, the prices are fair and the atmosphere and people-watching is stellar.

As a bonus, the parking situation is pretty good.  High marks for them on that one.<//Text>

Been going here for over 50 years and the food has always been great, but lately they have been  putting less meat in the  sandwiches. Would have given a 5 star rating if it wasn't for this.</text>

<Text>This has been a staple since childhood.  The beef dips have never gotten old, and I usually get em drenched with a little extra aus jus. They’re not as quality of an overall sandwich as Langers or Canters offers, but this place is the quintessential lunch place where you can get a quick bite. It used to be tradition to go here before a Dodger game.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>Where can you get authentic french dipped sandwiches?? If you know let me know. Otherwise, this is the place for some mouth-watering french dipped sandwiches. I was first brought here with my grand pa and then my dad. This place has a lot of historical meaning to it. The long lines and returning customer base can definitely tell you that this place is swinging. I would recommend coming here just to sit down and enjoy some tasty french dipped sandwiches any day of the week. Keep it up!!!!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>As a Brazilian tourist, I'm saying with all respect that the dip sandwich looks disgusting, I went to this restaurant because I love grilled subs like Charley's, but when I was in the restaurant I've seen that they dip the sandwich in an black liquid that for me looks disgusting. I didn't get to prove it, so my impressions is only bias. The ambient is familiar and there's a lot of tables available.</Review>< Name>

<Review>Lamb single dip with hot mustard to dip it in. Can't wait to come back and eat a lot more. Great staff.

Coffee was 46 cents I think. And they had some sweet T-shirt’s.

Walked here from Union Station on my way to a basketball game at Staples. And I had some Cielito Lindo taquitos during the walk!< /Review>< resp>

<review>Old school sandwich restaurant from 1908. The main reason for coming here is the ambiance, since it still looks like in the old times. The French dip sandwiches are good. I tried Tapioca for dessert last time and I liked it as well. My problem is that every time I came here there are always long lines to order.</review>< pictures>

Philippe french dip sandwiches are in LA staple and continue to draw me in, no matter what the hour is. I almost have an emotional experience with the place; anytime that I returned from a night of drinking, my pals and I would always grab a bite to eat from the establishment. Although their breakfast is not on par with other Great LA eateries such as The Pantry, Philippe holds up with its own unique experience. Nothing tops a lunch like a French dip sandwich and coleslaw. Their drinks are refreshing, cheap, and in perfect portions. The staff is always friendly, and moves quickly. I could say that one thing that is required upon every visit to the restaurant is their house mustard sauce that that sits upon every table. Philippe is a must-try.< /text>

Pastrami was horrible.
Banana cream pie was just whipped cream with a few banana pieces; no banana flavor. Over priced!!!
However, the beef dips were outstanding as always!!!</Text>

Consistently good but a bit pricey for 2 oz of protein,  I guess you pay for the experience but you really don't get much for a sandwich and a salad although lemonade and coffee are good and very very inexpensive...<//review>

Featuring sandwiches, breakfast, custards, pies, tapiocas, and unbelievably cheap list of beer and wine, Philippe's is the perfect stop for locals and tourists alike. Come before or after a Clippers game or anytime you have the chance in downtown LA.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5</Gmap_id><time>1491504132341</time><Response>None<//Response><username>Aidan McMurry</username></record></dataset><record>

<text>It almost lives up to its hype. The sandwiches are good but not amazing, it definitely isn't worth traveling out of the way or fighting traffic if you're not familiar with the area. However if you're nearby or really want to travel downtown to try it then you probably won't be disappointed. Counter serve, it's a bit unorganized for those not familiar with the style of service. If you like your French dip juicy then definitely get it wet because double dip isn't enough. I tried the straight chili that has no beans and it was good but a tad bland, imo. The baked apple was also good and a unique menu item that I don't see around too often. Lots of side item choices and other menu items for breakfast if french dip isn't what you're looking for.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

There was no wait in line but no energy by the waitress, Had the lamb sandwich and that was really yummy. The lamb was nice and flavor filled! The sandwiches were a bit on the small side (less than a six inch at subway for twice the price) also tried one of the pickled egg and that was really good too. I wish it was not cash only but still a must visit</review>

It was a nice leisurely walk from the city hall if you like me are a tourist adament about no renting a car. The place is not difficult to find and is also a short walk from the union station. The resturant is popular and the counter service was prompt and friendly.

We had the dipped beef and the serving size and taste was on point. I like how there was the sogginess goodness of the sauce as well as a light crunch from the outer skin of the French roll. And yes additional mustard on the beef does make a positive difference in taste. The soup was a little underwhelming though, and I had the Manhatten chowder bowl.

Whilst there is generally favourable reviews and I personally liked the food, I would not travel all the way out to get a taste. But it is a wonderful side trip from the city hall. On a side note, did I see the chef from 2 broke girls there? ...<//Text>

Went here for lunch with my band mates and I thought this restaurant would be good considering it was featured by Zagat and had many positive reviews. Ordered a lamb sandwich with Swiss  cheese (extra charge) and a slice of chocolate cake, total around $16. The atmosphere screamed hype. The main room was very crowded and there were weird wood shavings on the floor that I almost slipped on numerous time. Since the main room was crowded we went upstairs. The rooms looked like I was eating in a woman's prison workhouse mess hall like in Iron Jawed Angels.  The food itself was not like I expected. It was very plain and utterly simple. I don't think this was worth the price. The signature "French Dip" was also quite plain to me. The cake was okay, nothing special. Overall eh food, nothing special.</Review>

Had very very high expectations after yrs of hearing rave reviews and only slightly disappointed because I went on a whim late one evening when i realized I was famished and it wad so close. I rushed in and devoured my Pork Dip sandwich in a minute or 2 not even stopping long enough to ask for a cup of au jus. It was small but it was tasty. Next time with family and/or friends. Don't miss this place if you do you will regret it. Staff friendly, prices moderate and ambiance (dirty but that's intended.)</review>

If you've never been here and call yourself a Los Angelen then you should check your claim because you are a phony. I take everyone who's new to the city here. Double dipped turkey with a bowl of chili is my usual. Make sure you drown it in there homemade mustard to kick it up a sinch. Yee+ 5 stars..<//Review>

I went to this place for my first time after seeing it on tv and loved it! I will be going more often since their dipped sandwiches are delicious! You have to also try their pastrami sandwich! They have beer to enjoy with your meal too!< /text>

Everyone has to go there. It like taking a step back in time.  I first heard about it seeing Huel Houser on tv and then ran into him there once and got a photo with him.  The  Sandwiches, potato salad, Chile are all excellent.   Their horseradish mustard will clear out your sinuses but Oh is it ever good.< /text>

Love Phillipe's. Love the mustard! Buy a jar sometime!
Free parking but it can be a nightmare when full.
Sawdust on floor! Long lines for ordering. Prices get higher and sandwiches smaller. still delish!<//Text>

Maybe Im hard to please but I didnt get the experience as being anything special. I lived 26 years in L.A. and never went here, been gone longer than that now and visited over the weekend and tried it out. It was okay but not as amazing as I exected so I guess Id say I was underwhelmed. It was okay but I was expecting exceptional.</text>

Great lamb dips.  The problem is the sandwiches are on the small side.  I wish they were as big as East Side Market's.< /Review>

<Review>Blood donors have been eating here for years,  so many in fact that many locals even call it Bloodys or House of Blood. Daniel Aherna,  the famous LA deputy attorney general even declared January 1st National Blood Dip Day in honor of all the donors.  ANNND the sandwiches cannot be beat. Try the hammer ox,  or the Trans Gender, it's the best of both worlds. Shelby always orders Kids in A Pit. It's a lot of food but so yummy.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<review>I can't believe I waited six months to post this review. I LOVE Philippe The Original! I've been here many times and try to hit it every time I go to LA. Everything I've had here has been great, lamb dip or pastrami are my go-tos, especially with their hot mustard ("It's hot, but good!") - got a bottle in my fridge right now - any of their deli salads, and a pickled egg and I'm a happy dude. Philippe The Original is THE best deli hands down. Damn, now I want a lamb sandwich. Haha.<//review><date>1521965577061<//date><user_name>Jesse Patscheck< /user_name>< user>

<review>Wonderful sandwich place.  Worth the sometimes long waits.  Sawdust on the floor adds to the charm, but the upstairs rooms make you feel like you're in a prison.  My favorite is the lamb dip sandwich; they cut it right off the bone.  They also serve beer and a cup of coffee is only 9 cents.<//review><time>1299176257060< /time></record></dataset><record>

French dipped sandwich with lamb was amazing. It went really well with the macaroni salad. Arby's does not compare to this establishment. It is a very good and also historical place to eat if you're in the LA area< /review>

Recommend the beef dip or lamb dip with swiss cheese. Get your sandwich double dipped for extra au jus.< /Review>

Fun, old L.A., a bit overpriced, most folks need two sandwiches, so at $20, best before a Dodgers game.</review>

<text>Parking is free in the parking lots for Philippe's customers. In L.A. That's amazing, people. Food is always good; service is top notch -- all of the employees I've ever come in contact with have been there a very long time and have great attitudes. There's a lot on the menu, but the dips are where it's at for me. Single dip is dipped on one side of the bread only; double dip is both sides; and wet is soaked. I enjoy the double -- it's wet enough to taste it, but doesn't fall apart on you. Sometimes wet is called for and the fork sees some action, but most often the double is home. Great place, great history, great people, great food.< /text>< Time>

Even though I believe Cole's really invented the French Dip sandwich here in Los Angeles because their story is more believable and their French Dip sandwich is of better quality and more delicious, I still go to Philippe's for it's straight chili topped with grated cheddar cheese and crushed crackers. They also make a jim dandy coleslaw the best anywhere in Los Angeles.< /Review>

Where else can you get a French dip with hot mustard at 8am? Great sandwiches.  They have a few parking lots nearby, so parking hasn't been an issue when I've gone.  The lines can be a little long, but they move quickly.</text>

Lots of good memories here, but I hadn't been in many years and so noticed the decline in quality. The coconut cream pie was really bad, where it used to be my favorite.<//text>

A place to eat while in LA. Easily accessible from Union Station. The beef dip is a solid choice. Get a pickled egg, too.</Text>

<Text>This place has goood sandwiches. I always get mine double dipped with turkey and cheddar. The only thing I don't like is you hand to wait in the crazy lines. When you walk inmake sure to walk toward the back line or the first row in front it goes by much faster. I like the trains they have inside too as pictures of LOS ANGELES city back in the day.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Sorry Langer’s, no shame in being numero dos, but the deli sandwich is a clever import, while the French dip is Angeleno to the core. We are lamb double dip folks, extra hot mustard, but we have tried every sandwich on the menu and there are no weak links. Also, the wide array of sides offers the possibility of being surprised year after year by yumminess as-yet-untried. Some favorites include pickles, potato salad, pickled beets, and baked apples. Great coffee too, used to be 9c, but still a steal at 46c! Get someone in your party to wait in line to order, and go stake out one of the back booths. Then you can hide from the world, kick sawdust around your feet, and pretend it’s 1908 all over again.< /Review>< time>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>The sandwich is simple, but delicious. I like to get the onion soup dip on the side so I can drink the remainder after I'm done with my sandwich. On the negative side, the servers seem kinda mad you're there and the lines can get a bit long. It's worth putting up with it for the food though.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Review>Great beef sandwiches served in this building for over 108 years. Big menu with great Macaroni salad. Deserts, iced tea were out lunch this day. It's located in old Downtown Los Angeles.

You guys... What happened to the place... Where's the nostalgic feeling I once had as I walked through the door... Where's the brick wall of the signatures.. initials.. and the couple's writing thier name showing undying love forever... It's changed... It used to remind me of my grandma... Now I don't even wanna go back... And ur sandwiches suck now...< /Text>

<text>Sandwich is excellent 👍😁👍 Free parking provides which is rare in LA. The mustard is what they’re famous for cause if you put took much is can be intensely spicy. Sometimes I don’t get the best staff & waiting times in line can take way too long but the positives outweighs the negatives.</text>< gmapID>

I'll have carved leg of lamb on a French roll, au jus. Hmm: make that two.<//Text>< pics>

The french dipped sandwiches are amazing, with a pickle on the side. This food is great, the servers are courteous and the place never changes. Wood chips on the floor and names on the walls, makes it that much more awesome.<//Review>

I've been coming since I'm a kid when my father would bring us. The entire area is a place out of time so walking the area as a tourist, not much has changed in 50 years.

I noticed they updated the menu board, the old one must have been there at least 50 years, so I don't see why it needed to go. Maybe millennials couldn't read the simple font. Haha. Hey, I just realized I didn't see the pickled eggs on the counter. Hmm.

The food hasn't changed and most of the interior hasn't. It still is a meal back in time. The amount they serve seems small but that's what it was. The food isn't OMG, but it is good. Most important it is fresh. The iced tea is real tea, not the stuff from a powder they pass off as tea at most places, even the fast casual places.  Same for the lemonade. The beef is fresh sliced roast beef, not fresh pressed into a round shape, add fillers and preservatives roast beef. If all you know is Arby's, you don't know good.

Go eat, bring cash. The only thing they did as a concession to the passing of time is add an ATM in the corner by the stairs.

While you're eating see if you can spot the last original pane of glass that had managed to survive at least 100 years.<//Text>

My 93y/o father -who grew up  in L.A. went here-as all my brother and extended family. Great food,prices this old Los Angeles icon still has sawdust on the floor (to soak up the blood-+I mean food spills)a a row of payphones with folding doors,a free parking lot for patrons(non-existant in downtown anywhere!)great staff and patrons from every culture,walk of life. Buy the brown mustard and a coffee mug-it the mug is thick so the coffee stays hot longer and the brown mustard is classic. The prices for food are always a bargain.Be sure to tip the Ladies taking your order.</Review>

A fun LA institution that takes you back in time. Guess they used to drink weak coffee back then, but the apple pie hit the mark. French dip is the main event, but I am eager to try the hot pastrami next time.< /Review>

The beef was sliced thinly to avoid it being dry and the soft bun held it all together.

Don't expect gourmet or hipster sambos here, as it is a no nonsense deli, keeping their sandwiches tasty and simple.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

The sandwich might not look pretty but it's just so good.  Get it double dipped so it's not as dry and it'll create this wonder contrast between the crunchy exterior French roll and the melt in your aujuis part of the roll.  Put some of their house Russian mustard and it's heavenly.  It is truly a LA institution and it still has that old tyme vibe that's missing in most part of LA.< /Review>

Please help to solve the problem about frames per Ray's statement. I can't afford to have forklift here any longer just to lift the plywood up on top, he is not able to do so if the frames is not correct. I am so disappointed the way your company does.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Sandwich was good but the first assistant Was Horrible.  She overlooked me and kept staring at me with a very unpleasant look on her face. As I qpproacjed the counter to place my order she stepped away and took the gentleman from behind me.
The woman who actually served me was absolutely wonderful. She saved the first visit for me, as I was going to leave after the attitude and horrible demeanor of the first cashier.</Text>

<review>Good beef dip sandwiches.  An institution....Been here since like the 20s.  Everyone should visit Philippe's.  Breakfast to dinner ...Open late.  Can get crowded.  Lines move fast.  Lots of menu options.  Line up...order...Find a table and eat.  Try the hot mustard.   Beer and wine.  Parking can be a challenge.</review>< Pics>

I had a single dipped beef sandwich and it was great. You definitely should try adding some home made mustard, which in my opinion makes the sandwich even better. The athmosphere is super chill.<//Text>

My favorite French dip spot in LA. When you walk in to the restaurant it's like you go back to the 1950s. Their specialty is the lamb dip. However, I have always stuck with the beef. Don't forget to try their potato salad or their apple pie!</review>

This place looks like a mix of my high school cafeteria and a bar. So, very historic and just like a bar it was poorly lit. It was very clean and the service was pretty fast for it being a Sunday morning. Servers and busser were all very polite.

The french dip sandwiches weren't all they're made out to be though. If you're into small bland soggy sandwiches with a few slices of meat that's lightly seasoned with maybe onion powder and black pepper.. This is definitely the spot for you.
Also the sauce that they put out on the table is not the way to go. Tasted like they mixed wasabi and mustard.
Enjoyed the experience made me reminisce but never coming back.< /Text>

<Review>I have lived in L.A. for 30 years and counting.  Yet, the first time I tried Phillipe's was April of this year.  Let me tell you, I had been missing out!!  The lines can be long and the service a little slow but it doesn't matter when you finally get your food.  The French Dip is the way to go.  Sinlge. With au jus on the side.  The more I come here the more I love the place.  Their lemonade is great too.  I had their custard pie which was great.  I would totally get the filling from here and the pie crust from House of Pies to make the perfect custard pie.  I highly recommend this place if you love beef sandwiches.  Parking is great as they have two lots. Pricey but worth it.< /Review>< Rating>

It's like stepping back in time at this historical downtown LA eatery.  The selection of dishes, sandwiches, desserts, and drinks is awesome!  Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner, it doesn't matter, all the dishes are wonderful and a great reminder of how great food is supposed to taste.  Service is fast and friendly.  The price is excellent and the atmosphere is like stepping back in time (in a good way).  Everytime I'm in downtown or shopping at Olvera Street, I stop in for bite to eat. Parking is okay and peek lunch and dinner hours can make you wait, but don't get upset, the food is worth it.  Definitely a must do if you go to LA.</review>

I've been to Philippe's multiple times.  When you go to a restaurant that is world renowned for French Dip, you should get the French Dip.  Which I have had many times before.  And it's super yummy.

Philippe's is a great, fun, historical restaurant, located in the Chinatown area of Los Angeles.  They offer a wide selection of foods, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They are famous for their French Dips.  Ask for a double dip (bread dipped in au jus), with your choice of beef, pork, turkey, lamb.  Their coleslaw was good!  I loved their potato salad last visit.  And their desserts look scrumptious!

There is free parking in the lot behind and across the street on Ord Street.. but don't go window shopping around the area as they will tow your car!  Parking is for customers only and strictly enforced!

They have a variety of seating.  Family style (share a table with some locals.. you'd be surprised all the history you can learn), table seating and booths.  Do yourself a favor and take the extra time to walk upstairs and in the front and check out the unique rooms, history and souvenirs.

There's saw dust on the floors.  You need to wait in lines to  order, but they go fast!  But do know what you want and remember.. it's CASH ONLY!!!

Also.. this is a great place to stop before the Dodger game, pick up a few dips and chips and head off to the game.  :)< /review>

Philippe's is an LA staple, home of the beef dip sandwich, she has been a part of the LA landscape for just over a hundred years. The staff are wonderful and the food is just Devine. Even if your not looking for a full meal why not stop in for some coffee and a slice of pie.< /Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>The quintessential every man's eatery. The prices are fair,  the food is filling and when you reach the cashier to order your food, you can tell but by the look in her eyes, that she's been on her feet five hours too long, with five more to go before calling it a night.  It's plain-jane in the most satisfying of ways.  Zero pretention in a city that can eat people alive.  what you see is what you get and sometimes that's all you really need.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Unique Los Angeles restaurant that is well worth enjoying a casual lunch. The French Dip bread is so tasty and great texture. Upstairs is much more quiet that the business of downstairs where orders are placed.<//text>

<Text>A blast from LA's past. I always expect to see Bogie walk through the door, hat pulled low. $.50 coffee. French dip sandwiches (the original) with real bone broth. Try the mustard. Don't mind the sawdust on the floor.< /Text><rating>5</rating><userid>102192290946235182918< /userid>< Resp>

<Text>I had high hopes for this place.... the pickled eggs were delicious! But the French dip not as good as I anticipated... we went to see the LA Mission immediately after and I rushed out of the church suddenly due to uncomfortable burning in my stomach... the poor vendor new what I was going to ask him as he saw it in my eyes. Rushed with me to show me the direction of the closest bathroom... not a good experience.</Text>< Pics>

Phillipe The Original is one of those L.A. institutions that works just as well for locals as it does for tourists.  Straightforward deli food in a retro atmosphere, stuck right between Chinatown and Olvera Street.  It can be crowded an noisy, but that's part of the flavor as well.</text>

< Review>
I don't understand what all the fuss is about, this place is way below what I expect from an iconic restaurant.   The portions are small, the prices are high and I get a better meal at the counter of any supermarket deli for the same price.  I will not be coming back, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else that give you good food for a fair value.</Review>

The success and longevity of a restaurants life is hard to predict. That being said, I say with 100% conviction that Phillippe's the Original will be around for a long time.

Phillippes has character. The ambiance is timeless. The textures and tones of the materials and lighting are very soft on the eyes.

The food is wonderful. Sandwiches are delicious. Prices are low. I would recommend Tapioca. Lemonade is 75 cents.

While every bite shouldn't include hot mustard, it nicely  compliments the sandwich.</review>

Everything about Philippe’s is great: free parking, sawdust on the floor, efficient staff, fair prices and, of course, the yummy sandwiches. My go-to is a beef, double dipped with blue cheese, coleslaw and ice tea.<//Text>

No more legacy prices but the food tastes great. If they ask if you want gravy on your biscuits and you say yes, you will get gravy on three biscuits and charge you 5 bucks for them. Don't know why they can't just put gravy on the biscuits on the breakfast plates. It came in a little terrine dish and was like a thick chowder, which was actually the soup of the day. It's not cheap. A pastrami sandwich will set you back almost 10 bucks with tax included. And the coffee cups are small so you are basically paying for the same $2 coffee but for half the cup.</Review>

The lamb dip is my favorite dip at Philippe's. There is also beef, pork, ham, turkey and pastrami sandwhiches. We got our sandwiches double dipped which was delicious, I would also recommend getting it "wet" which is dipping the whole sandwich in au jus. There is also coffee for 50 cents.</Text>

Definitely an icon in the area with easy access from the Metro stop. Though it's always crowded, the line actually moves very quickly as they have their processes down to move customers through it quickly.</Text>

<text>A local brought me here, and I totally had my mind blown! It was just like grabbing a pit-beed sandwich and fixins at a great BBQ.
Expect a line. Tons of seating and the line moves pretty adeptly.  Cafeteria-styled serving.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>A Los Angeles exclusive. This place looks like it's stuck in the thirties in the best way possible. The French dip sandwiches definitely live up to the hype. A cup of coffee is only 45 cents. Granted that's 40 more sense than it was when Bukowski was ordering it but hey that's a decent price for me. Very old school diner or cafeteria vibe. Ordering food can be kind of confusing because at times there seems to be spots for 3 lines and others spots for only one line. Once you figure out the system though the food does not disappoint.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5< /gmapID></record>

Ambiance is Kitschy, and pseudo - historic with delightfully high fat food, vegans be afraid, be VERY afraid. YES, I'd rather die earlier. A place to take your clueless mid - western relatives. "Why are all the streets in Spanish?" Duh.< /review>

<Review>Terrible terrible food. When you put cheese on a  sandwich, I expect it to melt. Well it doesn't! The taste of the meat was mediocre. I will not be returning to this establishment. If you love the Los Angeles Dodgers and mediocre sandwiches, then it's the place for you, but not for me.< /Review>< pics>

I've been going here since I was a kid and hopefully will continue to until I'm an old man. If you haven't been before, you have to try the beef dip. If you're looking to branch out, my favorite sandwich is a lamb with blue cheese, double dipped, with plenty of mustard. Sometimes, if I'm really hungry, I'll go for the potato salad and some custard. I don't know if they still allow it, but a great way to beat the prices at dodger stadium is to get a couple of sandwiches to go and take them to the game with you.

The lines can be a little intimidating to first timers, but don't fret. Take a second to scope out the lines and you can usually find a short one hidden at the end, or with two cashiers instead of one.< /Text>

I have always wanted to go, and now it gives me great pleasure to announce that I successfully completed my quest. The sandwiches speak for themselves; double dipped. But 45 cents for a coffee, with a slice of chocolate cream pie of course, is outrageous.< /Review>

Basks in the nostalgic glow of urban America past.  Double dipped sandwiches are tripenducular.  I've been coming to this place since I was a child.< /Review>

Pretty good French dipped sandwich. Sides were alright. Before a Dodgers game it is beyond crowded. It is a classic though.<//Review>

< review>
Delicious roast beef au jus sandwiches, and the beef stew is plentiful and dirt cheap, like the fresh and natural-tasting desserts, coffee is phenomenally satisfying and only 50 cents, but everything else, as in sandwiches, is overpriced and a la carte...potato salad, cole slaw, etc., and the manager is a begrudging,  stingy,  unaccommodating creep, so petty, he will not give out ketchup packets for the stew or anything, after breakfast! I boycotted the place, over that, for 8 months!

UPDATE- NEVER, EVER GOING BACK, BECAUSE OF THIS PREPOSTEROUSLY PETTY, INCOMPETENT, PENNY-PINCHING HALF-WIT. What a rigid-minded clown caricature! He refused allowing the staff to make me a pot of decaf,  because it was late, and most would be wasted, and I told him to his face what a cheap, insulting slob, he was, how he had no clue about managing a restaurant, and about SATISFYING A CUSTOMER, AT LEAST A WHITE ONE, and how I would never go back there, and I mean it. Many people in L. A. are so tasteless and masochistically addicted to abuse and inhumanity,  as well as to high prices, for A LITTLE AMOUNT OF FOOD THAT IS NOT THAT GOOD-TASTING, IT IS NOT FUNNY. THE CHEESE CAKE SUCKS, IN CONSISTENCY (MUSHY) AND TASTE, JERSEY MIKES HAS WAY BIGGER AND BETTER STEAK SANDWICHES, THEIR BREAKFAST IS EXORBITANTLY OVERPRICED AND SKIMPY, THEIR CHARGING A FORTUNE FOR ONE, LOUSY EGG, AND TWO ARE EVEN MORE, and it's a dirty, dingy, depressing and degrading hole. Fine. I went to a Starbucks, and got everything I wanted, decaf included, whipped cream and caramel drizzle that PhiCreepe's does NOT have, was treated RESPECTFULLY, and had a great time. Screw Philippe and the burro he rode in in..< /review>

Very neat place... a touch of another era.  I'd go more for the nostalgia than the food though.  The building shows its age (in a good way) and it seems like they haven't changed a whole lot in their extensive and successful history.

I had the beef french dip.  The portion was on the small side and the au jus was a little salty.  I'd say that is was OK.  However, the blueberry pie was amazing.  All of the prices are from another era as well, with lemonade for $0.75 and iced tea for $0.65.  For a drink, sandwich, and pie, everything was $15.  The staff was very nice and the food was prepared quickly.

Overall, I'd recommend checking it out.< /review>

Soooo good!! It looks packed most of the time but it usually goes pretty quick in line. Worth the small wait forsure!! I've been coming here since I was a kid with my mom and i make sure I stop everytime I'm back in L.A. It's such a lovely memory of her everytime I walk inside.<//review>

Was surprised. The beef dip with swiss was very hearty. The bread looked like it was going to fall apart but when I grabbed it I thought THIS BUN DEFIES GRAVITY! Best potato salad in a while. The atmosphere is worth it too. Kudos.</Text>

I really like the historic feel that the inside has going on. It's a cool spot but the sandwiches are just not for me. I'm a cheese, lettuce,  tomato and avocado with meats type of girl. My sandwich had Turkey and swiss cheese (and I had asked for Jack cheese). My dad didnt even get cheese in his (he asked for Swiss). It was too dry of a sandwich for my taste. The potatoe salad was also okay. I'm glad I tired this place at least once, because I don't see myself ever returning.<//Text>

Decent French dip sandwiches, but the sides were not good at all. A bit of a zoo inside. Not cheap. It has history, but I wouldn't go out of my way for Philippe's again.< /Review>

Love the food at Philippes but the prices are a bit over the top. It is a no frills place that has been around since 1908 but the cost of the food is just to much.< /Review>

Long lines for breakfast. It might only be worth the wait because of the prices, if your down with long lines.
If you decide to wait for breakfast wear comfortable shoes. ;)
The French 'dip' is pre-dipped for you.< /Review>

Another "institution" that has survived the decades for good reason. I had the beef dip, double-dipped in au ju, with hot mustard. It's just some of best sloppy, carnivorous fare.
Note: next time keep elbows over table. This sammich is drenched.< /Review>

Extremely busy but worth the wait. Fantastic classic sandwich from the oldest locally owned restaurant in LA. I had the beef double dipped minus the cheese. The beef was tender with no gristle or much fat. The aus jus was perfectly seasoned. Wasn't salty at all which most places use salt instead of the natural flavors from the meat. If you like a little kick, try the mustard. It has great flavor and heat from the horse radish. If I ever make it back to Los Angeles, I will be returning.< /review>

I get it. The original French dip. But was it outrageous, hand made, fresh and delicious? Felt like just another sandwich. Flavors fell flat. Need to work on a house made au jous to kick it up a notch.< /review>

<text>Best sandwich in LA.   But get it to go because then you can get the juice on the side. If you eat in house they only will dunk the bread nothing to dip</text></record>

Hands down the best French dip in the land far and wide.   Expect big lines specially on lunch or dinner times.   One of LAs original and most well known places</text>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Saddly this was a old family place we would enjoy. Stopped there to take my mom who suffers with dementia and Alzheimer's. To try to bring a smile. Placed order. Sandwiches where not dipped, meat on pastrmi burn and cold. Dry.desert not given to me.   Order was not given as placed. Sad to say I drove all the way from san dimas. Being disabled and on a budget. I was  short a sandwich. And dessert. I should of checked bag to assure food was in there. Got home and very hurt and 😢 sad about this whole day, I've saved for a special day for me mom and friend. Am very hurt it turned out to be a very sad day for us all.< /Review>< pics>

Loved the sandwich beef french dipped, macaroni salad, coffee and boysenberry pie. Historic landmark in Los Angeles since 1908.

Marks taken off for the obvious reasons, those that follow me on Facebook know those reasons already. It was nice to sit down and eat at an authentic restaurant fells like the 50's and later than the 60's instead of one of these new fangled  slick fake ass eateries they have nowadays.< /Review>

I typically eat here when I visit my data center with ARP Networks. Their signature mustard will light your mouth on fire. I've told people that if I was ever sentenced to death, that I'd want my last meal to be a slice of cheesecake from Philippe's.< /review>

Always a scrumptious double dip roast beef. Best lemonade and Cole slaw is as homemade tasting Wo being at home. Love the pickeled eggs! Owner overheard that my egg was overlooked when ordering and brought me out a few. Very nice of her!  She didn't have to do that, but I'm glad she did. 😉<//text>

I was so disappointed, I haven't eaten at Philippe's in quite a while, and decided to go with a friend. I always get the lamb sandwich, double dipped. Usually it's really tasty, the lamb slow roasted, so tender. This time, the meat was cooked, but it tasted like they roasted it too quickly, so it wasn't as tender and flavorful as it has been in the past. We were there a little after 8pm, so it wasn't right at closing time. The pickles were good, the cole slaw tangy, the French onion soup, meh. Maybe it was an off night, so I'll give it another shot.</Text>

<Review>For the people who really love meat sandwiches and old style pickled egg treats, green pies, and cold celephane-covered salads. Not knocking any of that... (I mean only to empathizing how specific the menu is -- it's not a subway)

Anyway, it's a must for the historical, tried and true atmosphere, au jus, and middle-aged nostalgia. And probably you won't come back unless you're already regular.</Review>< Gmap_id>

Best French dip sandwiches!!! Traditionally beef is what everyone gets, but I love to get lamb. And don't forget to get the spicy mustard.</Text>

i can't write anything here that the other reviews have not mentioned so lets cut to the chase and get down to it

must order:
-french dipped, preferred choice of meat is beef but they also have lamb as well...interesting...you also have single dipped, double dipped, or wet options, i tried double, it was just the right amount of softness in the bread, maybe i'll try wet next time..

-potato salad, in one word, amazing, one of the best i ever had that's not korean styled, although wingstop's potato salad is pretty bombed mixed with the original spicy sauce, but that's not the point, just get it, you'll know, they use whole slices of potatoes instead of chunks

-dont forget to use the spicy mustard that they give you on the table as condiment, it packs a horse's kick and will knock you off to the ground if you put too much, i like it, since i prefer wasabi

-for a 7dollar sandwich, it's definitely worth the trip, they have their own private philippe parking lot on the opposite side of the street, dont park 2 streets away like my friend Luke L and I did

-they also have a 2nd floor for more dining area, it feels like a classroom, or an abandoned laboratory though< /Review>

AUTHENTICITY& history DRIPS off of the walls. LAMB DIP ordered WET so plenty of au jus. No fries because Lays Plain are the only 'taters which accompany these French dips- Available from 6AM to closing because PHILIPPE clientele have always needed to grab lunch to-go in the morning before work.✔out ALL of the SIDE DISHES. BREAKFAST impressive. USC LEGEND!</text>

< Review>
I was dragged here by a friend that knows I don't eat meat. While they don't have much vegetarian options I didn't really mind my cheese sandwich, but it wasn't all that great either. My friend really enjoyed his double dipped roast beef sandwich at least. The location is small and parking is very difficult. Lines will be long and crazy!</Review>

The stingy sandwich and attitude when a customer receives their change is rude. A TIP MUST BE GIVEN, that is the impression i got. and if a customer is not alert, shortchange may happen. This place is over rated and for the hicks and rubes that believe B S . people in the know are smarter. Brennan and carr in brooklyn n.y. puts this joint to shame.<//Text>

Too bad, I brought a friend there for the first time and she had to see all of that. Not all great experience for my friend.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<text>I saw this on Huell Howser's show California's Gold. So I had to go! I got there about 3:30pm in the afternoon on Thursday. It was not busy. I looked for a line however the lady at the counter said come on up. I told her it was my first time there and she laughed. I ordered the french dip of course. It was one of the best sandwiches I have eaten! I also had lemonade for .75 cents! Juicy beef, great roll, absolutely delicious. If you are around there I would recommend giving it a try.</text>< Pics>

An L.A. original, but sadly has fallen into a typical LA hotspot, where fame has eroded quality.  After the average 20-40 minute wait, you will wait so long to receive your food that the sandwich is water logged and cold.  Its simple physics, bread dipped in hot soup will be cold and coagulated in mere minutes.  They should dip the sandwiches just prior to plating.  Very disappointing experience, try if you must, but don't have high hopes<//text>

I love French dip... but here You don’t get any au jus to dip your sandwich in.
They pre dip your bread for you. I got the double dip and it was still dry. No flavor. Very bland.< /text>

<text>The beef dip is a bit dry. The first time I visited was over 5 years ago, so I thought maybe it was a fluke. After all they are famous for it. After trying it several more times in recent months my opinion hasn't changed. I'd rather have au jus on the side but it's not an option here. The sandwich is also not that big so to get a truly filling meal you have to order sides, which quickly adds up to an over $10 meal. To me that's a bit expensive for what you get.</text>< Pics>

The place is about an hour drive from our house but this is usually the place where I meet my daughters to eat on weekends now that they are on college. The place is clean and the food is great. At a very friendly price, you'll surely get full. :)< /review>

The place is so famous as it is busy, anyhow, the staff manage a really fast and freindly service. Atmosphere feel like an old french train station. Food is good, the french dip of course but also a large seleccion of pies .... yummy.</text>

It's all about the simple things in life and Philippe's definitely nails the simple things. Be careful of that spicy mustard though!< /text>

Been a fan of Philippes for over 45 years !!! I dislike rating this place a 2 star, But I CANNOT see paying over $ 9.00 for a smaller sandwich of selected meat that should only be worth $6 most $7.00!! I get the same sandwiches for that price at other local  establishments!! Also keep in mind that NO other side comes with that smaller french roll sandwich. My total was over $13.50 with a small side of coleslaw. It just isn't what it used to be !! And I most likely will not be  visiting any time soon...<//review>

I felt that it was overpriced for a small sandwhich. Nostalgic doesn't equal delicious. It looks cool inside. It tasted just ok. I will say that the potatoe salad is amazing. Do yourself a favor, Go across the street to olvera street and get better food at a better price.<//text>

Such a great old feeling to this place. The sandwiches are good albeit a little small. This or coles? I'd say this is better but Coles offers a better happy hour</Text>

The wood chips on the floor.. the old pictures up.. the little candy stand.. the old pay phones.. the cute old booths... The old fashioned restrooms.. wait.. did I say old fashioned.. what a joke.. Philippe's modernized thier restrooms like morons..bthey even changed the mustard holders and the napkin holders... May not mean much to most.. but to me it matters.. this place has changed so much... That I hate it now... I walk in here and it makes me cry now.. it's like this place joined ranks and became a follower by modernizing this antique... How can you improve something that never needed improving... How can u modernize a classic... U can't.. I'm sorry.. u just can't.. Im so sorry.. but I won't be coming back.. and it's so sad to.. cuz my opinion doesn't even matter... the food has even changed... Bye u guys...<//review>< Pics>

The original west coast French dip.. doesn't get any better than this.  Bread, meat, au jus - no more, no less. No extra frills, no modern day interpretations, this is just a delicious and unchanged classic of LA.< /text>

Food is okay but like the history behind this place since it lets you relive the old days when things were simple, cheap and no frills. Menu here is basic and food isn't from a chain but prepared from a kitchen that has probably served millions of people over the years.< /review>

good ,  bday dinner was good   the side dishes are pricey ... but the meal ideal was 1lb of the meet and they give you rolls and dipping au ju for 17$ it feed 3 and  enough for a leftover sandwich  late night  thats the good deal i think .. its better than 8$ a sandwich .. this is one of the only places that does stay the same as it was 20 years ago the first time i went .. i like that its hard to stay the same /good /quality  over time ... not many places ... maybe pie and burger also</review>

I feel like I stole Doc Brown's DeLorean and went back in time when I come here. The food and decor are basic, but well executed. Make sure you ask for your sandwich to be double-dipped, as the au jus is the best in the world. Lemonade and ice tea are only 35 cents apiece. The wait may be a long one, especially at lunch or before a Dodgers game, but your patience will be rewarded.< /Review>

Delicious french dip sandwich.  It should be since they invented it.  The atmosphere is very unique too.  The only difficulty here is finding parking and finding a place to sit inside.< /text>

Get the roast beef with Jack cheese, double dipped, and dress it up with their hot mustard...oh my gawd...to slobber for.

Service is good and quick...not to mention they have their own private lot, which is a big PLUS for any eatery located in Downtown LA.< /Text>

< review>
The American "French Dip" sandwich has been a personal favorite since I was a child -- and you don't see it offered on many menus today. Philippe the Original claims to be the originator of the French Dip -- but at least two other SoCal restaurants make the same claim... In any case, the sandwich here is yummy -- served on a freshly baked French roll dipped in "Au Jus" (pan juices). I suggest that you specify double-dipped instead of single dip since Philippe's French Dip does not come as it did when I was a kid -- served with a bowl full of the salty pan juices for dunking. Don't forget to add a slap of the molten-hot yellow mustard available at each table. It really makes this sandwich. (And the next time I visit, I'm trying the addition of blue cheese -- for a mere 80-cents.)</review>

<text>I'll be as concise as possible... for a change of pace: Philippe's French dip sandwiches are da bomb.  (Did I really write that?  Shame on me!).

As neither of us was feeling particularly beefish, we went with pork: she had the ham with Swiss French dip, and I had the pulled pork.  Ham is ham, but the same cannot be said about pork, and this was simply the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had.  Delicious, satisfying, even filling without any sides, the sandwich cost a mere $6.75, a bargain by LA standards.

As for the ambiance... I happen to enjoy people who share my physique, which is based more on girth than on muscle tone.  This is good, because most of the patrons looked as though they ate at Phillipe daily, repeatedly and in vast quantities.  I happen to like sawdust on the floor as I have a habit of projectile vomiting when displeased with a meal, though it was hardly necessary this time.  The interior has an old-timey feel about it that is very appealing, especially to old farts like me.

The best part was the staff.  Most of them have been there for decades, I know thanks to Huell Howser (who commanded me in his own easy going way to eat here).  I always prefer giving my business to employees who enjoy their work, which is a big part of why we WILL be going back to Philippe.  That and the fact that the food is excellent and affordable.< /text>< Pics>

<text>Solid believer in this establishment.  They have a no frills style that allows them to focus on the meat and sauce.  Get the beef and make sure you get the extra inhouse mustard.  Its the best sauce next to sirracha.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>What is there to say about this place that hasn't been said in the 4,000+ reviews. Philippe's offered what had to be the best sandwiches I've ever had, all dipped in a wonderful au-jus sauce. They've been operating since 1908 and it shows in the both the style and the quality.

Bitting into those sandwiches was like a religion experience. I was there 3 times on my recent trip to Los Angeles and never got sick of it. The atmosphere is great, the long lines fade quickly with a very efficient, old-school service. And yes, I brought back a jar of mustard home with me.

It's conveniently located near Dodger stadium which makes it all the better because you can make it the eat-before-the-ballgame place. Very highly recommended!<//Text>< Pictures>

This place is on our must visit list every time we visit LA. The staff is always very friendly, the sandwiches and macoroni salad are delicious! I usually get a turkey dip, double dipped (they dip both pieces of bread in the au jus) sometimes with bleu cheese. I have tried the beef, turkey and lamb dips. The turkey happens to be my favorite. I also like that you can get iced tea or lemonade for about 80 cents. I highly recommend everyone try this place at least once. There is a reason they have been around forever!</Review>

<Review>This place is great, love the location in Dowtown L.A. and it is such an iconic place. Come to L.A., you gotta check out Philipe's. Great dip sandwiches and salads. It's a casual place, but it's all about the food. I try to hit this place everytime I'm in the Downtown area.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5< /Gmap_id></record>

if you like hand-made sandwiches, potato slad, noodle salad and aged dill pickles, for which ou will have to stand in line, go here. it's a long-time downtown l.a. institution, and an especially good place to take out-of-town visitors who have likely not experienced a similar restaurant in their home towns.<//review>

I'm really not sure what the hype is about this place.  I come in and its a long line everywhere I go.  The lines take forever to move, but when I order and leave it takes one minute to get my food and another minute to finish my sandwich.  I don't think the sandwich is that great, just average to me.  It didn't really wow me at all even though it is an LA staple.< /review>

A must seat-and-eat breakfast and lunch place to visit if you're in L.A. Their Philly Sandwiches are delicious. THe lamb philly cheese sandwich is my favorite but everything in this place is completely heaven to your palete.

The only con I would say is a cash only place. but they have an ATM machine inside.< /text>

<text>So the notorious debate between Philippe and Coles about who created the french dip seems to have been settled at least to me. While Coles does have an interesting secret "speak-easy" bar in the back in terms of actual French Dip it was overpriced, heavy and dry in my opinion.  I like my french dip wet (not an option at Coles) sort of heavy because of  the heavy pretzel baguette and also dry because the bread wasnt able to absorb the au jus. Price was $12 and seemed high for my experience.
Philippe's French Dip  seperated itself from the pack as best french dip in LA for me in these ways:
-meat choices: beef (roasted in-house daily), pork (roasted in-house daily), turkey (outsourced), lamb (roasted in-house daily), ham (roasted in-house daily).
-bread choice: wheat (baguette), white (baguette), rye (slice), sourdough (slice)
-dip choice: 1 dip, double dip, "Wet"

With all the options you can create the perfect dip for your taste...not to mention all the sides, soups (including split pea and pot roast) as well as homemade pies like boysenberry, and banana cream...so thats what really matters to me...the food...HOWEVER...if you are a purist then you are also in luck because there is verifiable evidence that Philippe's is the actual creator of the French Dip sandwich in 1908!
So there you have it, the best of both worlds,  the better sandwich, the better value  and the original...for me...Case closed! Philippe The Original is the Palace of Versailles of French Dips<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Review>Here is my 5 star Yelp! review:

I'll be as concise as possible... for a change of pace: Philippe's French dip sandwiches are da bomb.  (Did I really write that?  Shame on me!).

This was our first visit, even though we eat at other restaurants within a block of Philippe regularly.  It's just that when we're in Chinatown, we're usually in the mood for Chinese food.  Who woulda figured, huh?

As neither of us was feeling particularly beefish, we went with pork: she had the ham with Swiss French dip, and I had the pulled pork.  Ham is ham, but the same cannot be said about pork, and this was simply the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had.  Delicious, satisfying, even filling without any sides, the sandwich cost a mere $6.75, a bargain by LA standards.

As for the ambiance... I happen to enjoy people who share my physique, which is based more on girth than on muscle tone.  This is good, because most of the patrons looked as though they ate at Phillipe daily, repeatedly and in vast quantities.  I happen to like sawdust on the floor as I have a habit of projectile vomiting when displeased with a meal, though it was hardly necessary this time.  The interior has an old-timey feel about it that is very appealing, especially to old farts like me.

The best part was the staff.  Today is Halloween and everyone was in costume, and they were all laughing and having a grand time.  I get the impression that this is the norm at Philippe; most of the staff has been there for decades, I know thanks to Huell Howser (who commanded me in his own easy going way to eat here).  I always prefer giving my business to employees who enjoy their work, which is a big part of why we WILL be going back to Philippe.  That and the fact that the food is excellent and affordable.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

I was very surprised in the quality of the food I ate.  I ordered a lamb dip sandwich but it didn't come with the sauce for dipping.  The restaurant didn't have saukraurt.  For a hefty price of $9.95 for a sandwich with only bread, I was very disappointed.<//Text>

Philippe you get 3.5 stars. There was quite a bit of hype about Philippe so I finally got sucked in. Despite the Travel Channel and Philippe great history, I didn't get the WOW I was hoping for. Respect for inventing the French Dip, but the original isn't always the best. Like the Apple One computer, it sucked and all the windows based PCs dominate still until present day. I'm ashamed to say.. Yardhouse has a better French Dip. You got beat by a chain Philippe.

Don't get my wrong Philippe is good shieet it just didn't meet up to the hype. I came only to try the Beef and Pork sandwiches. After tasting my dry "double dip" style, I wanted more. Its only about 6 or 7 bucks per sandwich, but let's be realistic if you are Man Vs Food like me.. You will order at least 3 or 4 sandwiches. Raising the average price to about $18 to $24 for a grown man. Not to mention CASH ONLY! Damn you... built in 1908 today is 2010 please take plastic.

I think the best way to experience Philippe is to try it all. You have to order pie, Cole slaw, chili, apple pie, and other endless sides. Also, order a variety of drinks because there are no refills. I saw some Philippe veterans ordering beer, ice tea, and lemonade. I feel like such a rookie, but my quest was for the sandwich so maybe next time I will try the bomb looking side dishes.

I recommend Philippe to anyone that was curious. Its a great local snack. I love traditional old fashion restaurants. Sometimes you need a break from Chain restaurants. A customer on TV said, "I drove a hour for this.." You lie! I drove an hour, but it doesn't make it better. BTW the spicy mustard is bomb, but don't try it if you don't like horseradish. Try to go on a Sunday. It wasn't crowded when I went and it was easy to find parking. Close FREE parking is a miracle in LA, but a standard everywhere else.< /text>

Cheaper places in that area to eat and get more fir your money, dont get sucked into the nostalgia. You get more beef on your sandwitch at flippin arbys that you do at this  joint, plus traffic sucks.  Id say eat cheap before you roll to this part of town</review>< pictures>

expensive but historic and a must try

tried the lamb sandwich, and asked for extra extra dipping sauce to bring home. made all the difference

i'm convinced what sets this place apart aside from its heritage is 1) the au jus and 2) the home made mustard

make sure you get enough of both!<//Review>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>If this is LAs "original" New York style deli, then I hope they hurry up with version 2.0.  That classic roast beef dip was not worth $7. and the sides are just ok.  I feel like I'm eating a school lunch, not an epic meal at a historic diner.

Do yourself a favor and head over to Anaheim and go to Katella Deli instead.

Or if you really want a mediocre French dip just find an Arby's.  It'll be half the price as this questionable institution.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

You cant do better than 5 stars which pretty much sums up the sandwich.

If you order something other than French Dip,  you're missing the point.  Old school and really fresh and tasty.  They also have a train museum inside and ita close enough to China town that you can walk off your lunch checking out all the weird stores or art galleries close by.

No extra au jus so dont ask</Review>

<review>The portions were small, the staff not very friendly (except the busser,cool guy), and wow they give you a tiny lemonade glass about 8 fl ozs filled with ice with no refills! You get about four sips of lemonade before it's gone. Cashier didn't care. She was just like yea sorry, no refills. After spending 30 bucks! Boooo, I hate cheap places.< /review><Name>Emily Francis< /Name>< date>

What's an old iconic restaurant the prices are a little high and the food okay it's a little dry and the restrooms are they have out houses out in the parking lot I mean if you want to go to an iconic place it's a nice place but other than that you know for $10 for a sandwich and a soda I think you can get a better deal down the street< /text>

<review>Philippe The Original has been around since 1908 and is famous for their "French Dipped Sandwich." Apparently the way the sandwich came to be was by accident, but it is no accident that this is their most popular item. It relocated to its current location in Chinatown back in 1951. I had taken the metro to this location so I cannot comment on the parking situation, but like most places in Chinatown metered street parking is probably your best bet. There are always lines here, but they move fast. Pick a line, order and pay at the counter, and then wait for your food. It was pretty crowded when I went so one of my friends went and found a table while we ordered for the group.

The signature "French Dipped Sandwich" comes with a crusty French roll dipped in their own authentic "jus" created from their freshly roasted meat. For meat you can choose between roast beef, roast pork, leg of lamb, turkey, or ham. Cheese is extra and you can choose between Swiss, Cheddar, American, Monterey Jack, and Blue Cheese. The final choice you can make is whether it is "single-dip", "double-dip", or "wet". I cannot recall if I chose single-dip or double-dip, but I got their roast beef sandwich with Monterey Jack cheese. I was worried that the sandwiches here would be too overhyped for me, but I enjoyed it. It did not change my life, but it was pretty good at the time (then again, I had just run a 5K, so I was pretty hungry).

I got a side of their Potato Salad and I really liked that. If you like potato salad, I would recommend getting it here. This place is a landmark in LA and I am glad I finally got to try them... over 100 years after they first opened!</review><GmapID>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Ive heard so much and wante to try this place forever.seems to be one of those institutions people prize for it's longevity. You cant argue that getting a cheap fast satisfying meal cant be done, cause it certainyl exists here. a beef and lamb sandwich, pickled eggs, and a tomato bisque for around $20/US is pretty damn cheap. I like the lamb better to be honest, but it's solid all around. the wood shavings on the ground is trippy.. All walks of life come here, cops, seniors, tourists, you name it, to get a piece of the history...</review><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>109941973511998908425< /user_id></record>

It was a good and fun atmosphere to be in. Yesterday was my first time trying this place. I tried both the beef and pork double dipped style. I hate to be the sour grape in this review thread, but to me it was an ok sandwich. Nothing special. For all my Latino friends, save the visit here and go to your local "tortas ahogadas" restaurant instead. Food was ok though. No complaints about quality and freshness.</text>

<Text>In the years that I have been working in South LA and sometimes driving by on my way home, I've never stopped to give this place a try. To be honest...I never even noticed this place before. And I have to admit...I've been missing out.

A friend decided that this was the place he wanted to go to to celebrate the new job he got. I personally though it was kind of strange place to want to go to, but hey, that's what he was feeling. The first thing I notice coming here was the abundance of FREE parking. For those not familiar with LA, parking can often times be an issue, so for me this was a definite plus.

The place operates more like a deli counter, you wait in line, order your items, pay and find a place to sit and munch away at your spread. The wait itself wasn't too bad, maybe 10 minutes from the back of the dinning area to the front counter.

Now, being I was in a French Dip joint, I ordered a dip sandwich. My wife and I got the Beef and Turkey respectively. She got her's with Swiss, while I got mine plain. In addition to our sandwiches, we got the cherry pie, potato salad, custard, and a pickle.

The dips were both good, but both the wifey and I preferred the beef over the turkey. The beef dip had much better taste and was much more moist, as the turkey one wasn't anything special, and the meat was slightly dry, especially considering that they reuse the wonderful juices from the meat.

On a side note, you need to use the In-House made Spicy Mustard. It's doesn't have the hot spicy flavor like chilies, but more like the burn of wasabi or horseradish. This was something that I just absolutely loved, I covered my halves of my dips in it.

The side orders didn't really have much to comment about, but the Cherry Pie was so good. The pie crust had the perfect consistency being perfectly flaky and yet still deliciously buttery. I'm looking forward to giving the other pies/desserts a try as well as the other dips....next up pork and lamb!

So for now remember to live well, but eat better!<//Text>< resp>

Rude lady named sandra told the mánager an i really dont think she cared but oh well, not coming back, chilli was to salty not the same patato salad was from a box at least it tastes like comercial food for cheap resturants, the place in my opinion is not the same anymore i came here all my life as a child the only thing that stood the same is the famous dips an there pickles. Try the beef stew looks like it may be better. As for us, will never come back.<//text>

< review>
I've been in LA for over 3 years, and I've been hearing about this place forever. "The best spot" "best of LA" , they always show it on different food channels when talking about LA. Maybe my expectations were too high. I got here, went to the counter, got the roast beef sandwich, asked for fries, they dont have it, so got a potatoe salad for side. The sandwich wasn't bad, but it was far from the best sandwich i've ever eaten. It was a regular roast beef sandwich covered with steak juice. You can get a sandwich like this on any Subway, or you could go to Quizno's and get a much better sandwich than Phillipe's. The Good: cheap prices. The Bad: ordinary sandwiches, over hype, tourist trap, does not meet expectations at all.</review>

This place is one of my personal favorites. Nothing compares to a double dip lamb French dip. The prices have sky rocket in the last couple of years. Worth it though.<//Text>

In my opinion the only reason why Philippe's is still open, is because of it's history. It's too expensive,  no adequate parking,  & the beef dip looks like a slider.< /Review>

Phillipe is an iconic place in LA, their French Dip Sandwiches are their staple food, but the menu is amazing, if you have been in business for over 100 years you must have something special going on.<//Review>

Order a wet roast beef French dip, eat, and repeat. If you're stuck at Union Station for more than an hour, this is the place to visit.< /Text>

Adam Richman, you let me down bro :(

Disgusting!

I'm not referring to the food, mind you, I'm referring to hygiene.

Lines were sorta long, but moved promptly enough.  When it was my turn, I ordered 2 beef sandwiches, 1 double-dipped & the other wet.  The worker proceeded to make my sandwiches sans gloves.  Yup, that's right.  NO gloves.  After she finished making them, she took my money, brought it over to the cashier, received the correct change, handed it to me all sans gloves.  Again, I repeat.  NO gloves.  How can this place pass county inspections when there's such a blatant violation right there?

The food itself was good.  The beef slices were very tasty & the sandwiches themselves were a tad smidgeon bigger than Arby's toasted subs.  The mustard is awesome.  It's yellow wasabi, as far as I'm concerned.  The hell with Sudafed, a lil bit of Philippe's mustard will decongest my sinuses.  Good, good stuff.

The only reason why I ate the food was because A) I was hungry & B) I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about.  Having done so, I don't see myself ever dining here again unless someone changes the food preparation.

<Review>Soon since moving to Las Vegas I haven't been to Los Angeles to much, when I met my wife we started doing Cali trips to the beach and whatnot. Wifey told me about this place as being an old school staple in LA.

Very close to Union Station and a 5 minutes walk from Olivera street (awesome street market btw). You walk in and its cafeteria-style seating, it was super crowded but we went before a Dodger game so that explained that.

So apparently you have to have the french dip, this is what there known for oh and it is the best french dip I've ever had. Make sure you bring cash, they do not take credit cards, there is an ATM machine in the store but if your like me you don't want to pay that stupid transaction fee.

The seating is quaint, never been upstairs, it is a comfortable atmosphere. If your a shy person and like your privacy this place probably isn't for you due to the close proximity of other diners. We've been back numerous times, its our lunch spot before the Dodger game. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Text>Old school diner best known for their french dipped sammies.

As I walked into the restaurant I immediately felt like I've been transported back into the 1950s. The whole place had an old school 50s vibe from the waitress' uniforms to the old wooden telephone booths. Since I've heard so much about this place I decided to drop by after a work meeting in Chinatown to see for myself what all the rave was about.

Unfortunately, after all the hype I have to admit that Philippe's did not meet my expectations. First off, I was quite upset that they did not accept credit card. They do have an ATM machine in the restaurant but the $2 transaction fee killed the mood. After getting my beef french dip sandwich, I noticed that they don't give you au jus on the side. I wasn't sure if this is extra but I love dipping my sammies in au jus and was quite disappointed. For the price of $7+tax, the sandwich just wasn't as filling as I had expected and if it wasn't for the spicy mustard sauce the sandwich would have tasted dry and bland. Perhaps if they knocked off a buck or two, I would then reconsider adding an additional star to their rating. Since I was still hungry I ordered a tapioca pudding ($2.67) for dessert and I still wasn't thoroughly impressed. Nothing really stood out to me. Since I heard from my coworker that the tuna melt is quite delicious here I guess I'll be trying that the next time around if I find myself dropping by again.</Text>< pics>

<Review>The food was great but when I was there 9-23-17 I cleared my group's table so a family could sit down. I took our trash over to the cart where the busboy was working and he slapped the trash out of my hands into the bin also knocking most of the silverware into the trash and rudely said "just leave the trash on the table!" It was incredibly rude and there is honestly a 50/50 chance of me going back. Their pickled eggs are on point though.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

Unfortunately not a positive experience.  Tracking information says the package was handed to a "resident", and that resident is not me.  It is not where packages typically are left, or with the office.  I needed a replacement and a refund and was told I'd have to wait 24 hours before this was possible.  Not satisfied< /review>

<text>Chalkboard menu does not have all items that are available. Long lines and not very patient people. Meat looks grey and no real flavor. Lots of tables left dirty. Did not enjoy the experience, will not be back again< /text><user>101549936171449129164<//user>< Time>

Atmosphere 8/10
Customer Experience 3/10

-Food is too hyped
-Atmosphere is good community tables and vintage deco
-Customer interaction needs work, food handling needs an overhaul hardly anybody wears gloves while handling food bare handed, no sinks to wash hands after handling POS or customer cards

Honest review wont come back or suggest tourist to this restaurant.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>The sandwiches are small and not tasty at all, although they are much more expensive than in Subway. The stuff is unfriendly and the place is very noisy and fussy.
And even the floor is dirty as hell, full of sawdust, you can't put your bag on it.<//Review></record>

I enjoyed it. It wasn't dipped like I asked. So, I was disappointed as a 1st time patron. A bit crowded. Thanks< /Review>

I just saw on ABC channel 7 an advertisement for this place Philippe ! The sandwiches looked amazing, but what stood out was, some of the workers were wearing gloves as they handle the food, and others were not.😔One of them had a glove on one hand and bare hands on the other. It was kind of confusing. I would love to go to this place, but tell me, do they use gloves, or not? Are they practicing safety measures or not?< /Text>

The triple dipped French dipped sandwiches are the best. We love Philippe’s and come in every time we are in the SoCal area.

This spot is a must! Plus I suggest to add a pickle on the side if you like pickles. Their pickles are very yummy as well as the special mustard sauce they offer.

Enjoy!< /text>

(Translated by Google) It is a sandwich shop that has been a landmark of LA for over 110 years. It seems that it is a familiar way to eat while dipping a roast beef sandwich.

The floor is littered with sawdust. I'm not sure why, but the retro American style seems to be loved by locals and tourists.

LAのランドマークとして110年以上続くサンドイッチ屋さんです。ローストビーフのサンドイッチをディップしながら食べるのがお馴染みの食べ方だそうです。

床にはおが屑が散らばっています。理由はよくわかりませんが、レトロなアメリカンスタイルが地元や観光客の皆さんに愛されているようです。</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) A historic diner near Chinatown. The specialty here is the French dip sandwich. Boil French bread in a slightly softened bread? Baked? Soak in gravy sauce with roast beef in between. There are several choices for the meat inside, such as ham and pork, but the basics are like beef. You can choose how to soak the gravy in three stages: single dip, double dip, and wet.

(Translated by Google) The best and first french dip! You have to try it. The place is like its opening day and has plenty of room to sit down to eat. It is recommended to know what to order before reaching the counter, as there are many people in the lines.

法式麵包夾牛肉、起士，超級好吃，麵包酥而不硬，切薄片的牛肉很軟嫩，沒有太多調味，吃起來簡單又美味，我們很幸運沒有遇到大排長龍，還有很乾淨明亮的洗手間，這點真的是大加分。< /text><rating>5< /rating><gmap_id>0x80c2c65b315cd377:0xa05d997b42357a5< /gmap_id><userid>105449480608224988646< /userid>< username>

(Translated by Google) Fame is more than anything, their sandwiches do not have vegetables or anything, the meats all seem the same, also they do not tell you that there are no certain foods, they only change it or do not add it without communicating it. Super disappointed, also they do not clean the tables properly despite the covid. I will not come back...

(Translated by Google) The price and volume are not balanced. The taste is decent, and the bread can't be fluffy with soup stock. Is this really good? That's $ 12, and in Japan there are many food stores that are three times as good as this one-third.

The bread is full of gravy and served with fresh beef. It’s awesome!

The store is in the basement, but I was surprised to see that it was very long, but I was surprised to see the burger I ordered....Bread + meat....
Locals say it's famous and it's not delicious...
It's not worth waiting in line for my taste buds...
But if you're hungry, it's delicious.
If you want to go there, go starving...
There are three stars because it is said to be a local famous place.

<review>(Translated by Google) Total disappointment! I went because I saw it in an episode of Man Vs Food but I did not find anything exciting in fact ... it looks like a canteen, the french dip with beef is mediocre ... the only good thing is beer on tap.

(Original)
Delusione totale! Ero andato perché l'avevo visto in un episodio di Man Vs Food ma non ci ho trovato niente di entusiasmante anzi... sembra una mensa, il french dip con carne di manzo è mediocre... l'unica cosa buona è la birra alla spina.</review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) It was the lightest and cleanest food of American food. Some people say it's not good. The more you eat it, the lighter it is, and the more you taste, the boring your first taste.

(Original)
미국음식중에 제일 담백하고 깔끔한 음식이었어요. 맛없다는 분들도 있을법한게 평양냉면같은 음식이에요. 담백하고 구수해서 먹으면 먹을수록 맛이 더 많이 느껴지고 첫맛은 심심해서 이게 뭐야 하실수도 있어요.</text>

(Translated by Google) The taste of a sandwich shop with a history of 110 years is below expectations
Salty and natural feeling. The bottom of the bread is wet, so it's called a deep sandwich... (Korean standards)

110년 역사의 샌드위치 가게 맛은 기대이하
짜고 네츄럴한 느낌. 빵 밑부분이 젖어있어 딮샌드위치라는데...(한국인 기준)<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Although the area is not a tourist destination, the shop is lined up and full of enthusiasm.
The atmosphere inside the store is one of the spots where you can taste the American atmosphere.
(You will be rushed in the procession, but if you have studied the way of the previous person you should be able to manage your order!)

(Translated by Google) One of the best places to eat in town! Their sandwiches are truly heavenly, so much so that when I went both my boyfriend and I had an encore! For the sake of it, I recommend adding cheese and sprinkling the bread with broth, you won't regret it! The atmosphere is also really beautiful!

Uno dei migliori posti dove mangiare in città! I loro panini sono davvero paradisiaci, tante che quando sono andata sia io che il mio ragazzo abbiamo fatto il bis!

(Translated by Google) In a nutshell, it tastes American. is
The crust was moderately chewy, with sliced ​​roast beef and cheese, and topped with gravy sauce.
I ate deliciously, but I thought that Koreans might not fit well with the average taste. No vegetables and no sauce.

However, the day I visited was at 11:00 AM on Sunday, but seniors who came to worship at a nearby church gathered and shook them. It was a local restaurant.

As someone who thinks that the taste of the real country is in a local restaurant, I would recommend it.

(Original)
한마디로 표현하자면 미국맛. 입니다
크러스트가 적당히 쫄깃한 빵에 저민 로스트비프와 치즈 를 얹고 윗빵엔 그레이비 소스를 발라서 주더군요.
저는 맛있게 먹었습니다만 한국사람들 평균 입맛엔 잘 안맞을지도 모르겟다고 생각이 들었습니다. 야채도 없고 소스도 없으니까요.

다만 제가 찾아간 날이 일요일 오전 11시께였는데 근처 교회에서 예배보고 나오신 어르신들이 몰려들어 북새통이더군요. 그야말로 로컬음식점이었습니다.

진짜 그나라의 맛은 로컬음식점에 있다고 생각하는 사람으로서 저는 추천 드리고 싶습니다.< /Text>

It just seems that the subway will fit more.
Bread and meat tips.
Far from the combination of vegetables and sauces like hamburgers.
So it didn't fit me.
Also, if you visit at night after 20:00, you will have to be on the lookout for more ...
I would rather go to a nearby Chinese house that has a similar price, and eat it in an atmosphere where I can eat properly.
Sandwiches and hot dogs are eaten somewhere else.

그냥 서브웨이가 더 입에 맞을 듯.
빵과 고기 끝.
햄버거처럼 갖은 채소와 소스의 조합과는 먼 곳.
그래서 나와는 맞지 않았음.
또한 20시 이후 밤에 방문하게 되면 사주경계를 해야되기 때문에 더......
차라리 비슷한 가격인 근처의 중국집을 가서 제대로된 식사를 할수있는 분위기에서 하겠음.

Another fast food system, you place the order and eat it at a table, quite uncomfortable by the way. The sandwich is good, but it's not for rocket shooting either. The good thing is that it is not very expensive either. The best mustard touch (don't forget to miss out!)

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>(Translated by Google) I discovered this site through the Man vs Food program, although it is a classic with many years in Los Angeles. The veal sandwich with the slice of bread moistened in the sauce of the meat itself, seems to me a delight. A lot of flavor in every bite and a large place with tables and benches to share with other diners, make this site a highly recommended classic in Los Angeles.

(Original)
Descubrí este sitio a través del programa Man vs Food, aunque se trata de todo un clásico con muchos años en Los Ángeles. El sandwich de ternera con la rebanada de pan humedecida en la salsa de la propia carne, me parece una delicia. Mucho sabor en cada bocado y un local amplio con mesas y bancos para compartir con otros comensales, hacen de este sitio un clásico muy recomendable en Los Ángeles.<//Review>< user>
