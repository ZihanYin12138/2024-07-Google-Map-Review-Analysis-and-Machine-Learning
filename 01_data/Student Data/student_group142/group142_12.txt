1st time at this restaurant.  Unfortunately it's such away from busy area.  Building is nice and staff is friendly.  Unfortunately can not give it a better rating.  Ordered chicken fried steak a d not only was it slightly over browned it lacked flavor and meat was tough.  Frys were great clam shower was great as well. As for the Mexican plate I got fajitas with had much better taste good homemade beans and good rise I think they should stick to Mexican or work on mastering America food
Other than thus all services were good< /text>

<Review>Food was wonderful. Shrimp is their specialty. Shrimp Empanadas were served freshly made, piping hot and delicious. Fajitas were perfect. Be sure to try the salsa verde. Freshly made with cilantro and jalapeño peppers. Great, friendly  service. An immaculate restaurant. Would definitely recommend.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x8092f11f7f637f67:0x3c15b95ac3076b57< /gmapID></record>

Quiet little diner. Very small town feel, but it's right off the highway. It was absolutely empty when I went, which is not really a good sign. But the food was promptly placed before us and it wasn't that bad. Wasn't anything special, but I was able to finish it.</text>

First visit there since opening. I was impressed by the desire to satisfy. I ordered wine, they were out, however the waitress offered  to go to the store to buy what I would like. The battery in her car was dead, she walked!  45 minutes later she arrived with a carrier of both reds and whites. For a young lady who doesn’t drink wine she has a future as a sommelier  Nice green salad, ok sandwich , great service. Good to see local business supporting the farm workers. Hope the new owners can put this business together and have success. Good luck</text>

Terrible. 40 minutes to get food. They were out of raff coffee out of biscuits after they said they had them. Omlett that was suppose to have sausage in it didn't. Went to pay bills they over charged us by 6 dollars. Then I paid in can and they did not have change to give back. Worst place ever</Review>

<Text>This restaurant is my preferable site.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to visit this place. Whenever  I want to go to a fair meal, this place comes right away to my head. good and varied  food and a rich cuisine.professional staff members, and pleasant atmosphere. Also important, the pay is reasonable. I sent my friends to this place with great pleasure.< /Text>< name>

My first time and I am very impressed. I can think of a single thing that wasn't wonderful! So much to choose from and reasonable prices. Amazing service. The meal was delicious. It's clean and large and has handmade things for sale as well as some antiques. I am very impressed!< /review>

I'm getting Wheels on Meals here in Arroyo Seco while this craziness is going on and I understand that the food comes from Lawrence's and it's good stuff by anybody's standards. I've had chili relleno, meat loaf, BBQ beef on a french roll, to name a few, and today was shrimp and fries. The shrimp were so big when I first looked, I thought it was chicken. All meals come with green or potato salad and condiments. I've never been to King City but when we're done with the virus I plan on taking a trip to Lawrence's since I already know I won't be disappointed. BTW, thanks for what you do for the community. Frankly, five stars ain't enough!!!!<//Review>

No longer Lawrence's! Sadly another covid victim.  New owners, stopped in for breakfast, not good. I hope they get it together.  Be prepared for super long wait, we were only ones there for breakfast, restaurant empty. We had to ask for every single thing twice, took over an hour. Bread tasted of refrigerator, eggs over done and had a hint of last nights whatever chili from grill, bacon deep fried to death.  No water in restroom toilets, apparently they have sewage issues like full septic?  They need a cook that is experienced, waitresses who have done more than just eat in a restaurant, some decor vs. the prison look, advertising and all this will require a lot of cash they most likely do not have. Very sad.   The old kieffer's used to be so good, a go to way point in travel - long gone.  They might have great dinners, it appears the dinner menu looks like an extensive collection of Mexican food, but breakfast, the simplest meal was a big miss.<//Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Worst place I've ever eaten and I should have been forwarned being that it is in King City. Unfortunately, a friend told me it was good but apparently his standards are lower than mine. The waitress spent the entire time chatting with her friends at the counter while her kid ran around in the kitchen completely unattended. I think there is a law against that. No refills on drinks. The food wasn't that interesting probably because when I tried to order, the waitress kept trying to race through getting it written down. I think this place a trap for travelers who have no other options. Notice they never have customers beyond two in the parking lot. There is a reason.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

Wasn't very crowded for a Saturday night. The food quality was acceptable and my steak was cooked correctly. Not fine dining, but as fine as it gets in this little town. Probably better than Denny's.</text>

A great alternative to the crappy, drive-thru chains in the area. The country gravy was nice, poached eggs just right. Chili needs some work, but with the half tuna-melt for ten bucks, great. Endless coffee, parking a go-go. Petrol next door. We'll be back.</text>< Pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><review>The food was poor, big portions but tasted like it was cooked with other stuff besides what I ordered. I ordered the ceaser salad, the chicken tasted like the grill it was cooked on could possibly have not been clean. The sliders were dry and bland. And parts of the salad tasted garlicky and maybe season salty as well. The staff was not friendly or talkative,  didn't ask how the food was, or asked if we needed anything, no check ups or anything.<//review>< pictures>

<rate>4</rate><text>When you are travelling & get tired of the chain restaurants, perhaps in search of real mashed potatoes, Real butter,  & real Pot roast, this is the place. This was my first visit,  & as a seasoned traveller,  I carry with me a shield of cynicism. Everything was fresh, except for the crackers that were served with a salad, but I did not tell them that fact.
I especially love the funky old historic mural across the back wall.  Despite the fact that it is currently culturally contrasting,  I'm  glad they kept it.
The Serving people were kind, & I met a lovely, Shy little girl who never told me her name. This place is high on my list of alternative, Old-school,  Real basics, Dining options.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<rating>1</rating><review>DO NOT GO HERE! This was the worst restaurant I have ever been to. Service was slow and horrible. The food was barely edible (yes we did eat it, passing through and needed to eat). When we finally got the waitresses attention to pay and get out of there we tried to use the bathroom but there was no toilet paper and the water was shut off for construction. My husband said the urinals and toilets were taken out so there was nothing to use. We had to go to the gas station up the road. Avoid this place at all costs!<//review>< resp>

<user_name>Renata Szymborski<//user_name><text>The food was mediocre on a good day. The portions were not satisfying or warm. Nor was the food presented in a pleasant, creative, make your mouth water kind of way. The atmosphere ,as a whole, was dull, unwelcoming; from the waitress, to the interior decor, even the lighting. I couldn't wait to leave.</text>< resp>

<Text>Kudos to the friendly and kind hearted people working at this office. All staff are very professional and efficient in their jobs. After waiting for about 10 minutes in the line, I got my biometrics and photo done within 5 minutes. Special thanks to all staff diligently working during the difficult time of covid-19.<//Text></record>

Big big thanks to the professional and kind hearted people, that work at this office.

I had a situation when my baby delivery was scheduled at the same day as my biometrics appointment day. I went there 3 business days before with doctor's certificate, to try to ask if it's possible to get it done earlier, since delivery could happen any day now.
I went there 30 min before they open the office, I was the first in line, but little bit later there were more than 10 people in line.

We explained our situation to security guard at the door and she was so professional and kind hearted to listen to us, checked our papers, passed the message to personnel inside the office. Just such an amazing person. She offered me even a chair after knowing that I am only few days away from delivery and made us feel comfortable.

Heartwarming and pleasant experience.
Thanks to amazing people that work here.< /text>

All staff were incredibly friendly and efficient in their jobs. Special mention to the guard, who was able to both keep everyone at ease through conversation and jokes, but also inform and direct people with the rules if need be.

For those wondering about the COVID-19 restrictions, they were very good. Appropriate distancing measures were in place everywhere, with special screens to separate staff where possible. Hand sanitizer everywhere and I saw staff cleaning down machines and seats after people had used them. Honestly even better than some clinics I've been to.< /review>< user_name>

I went there for fingerprint recording of my Canada visa application. I have an appointment two weeks later but I’m afraid that’s too late for my travel. So I try to walk-in and the guard let me in (maybe because they are not busy at that time). There are almost no one waiting and I just spent 5 mins for the whole process. The service is really great and the pace is really fast.

This is unlike the DMV, which may be the worst place in the world.<//text>

The security guard is very very rude. I come with my kids who doesn’t speak English. When I come close to say If they need translator I am here. The guard behavior was very bad.< /Text>

Staff were courteous and efficient. A lot of people are all given the same appointment time. If you want to leave early, arrive early and stand in line. I stood in line half an hour before the office opened, and there were already 15 people in line.< /text>

@Alessio Vallero was right. We also had a very amazing experience!!! There were only handful of people when we got there around 11am on Wednesday. My mom did not have an appointment letter with her due to her urgency to travel abroad.
But they were so nice to allow us to meet an officer who understand and allow my mom to get her bio-metric done. Truly wonderful people and personnel!<//text>

Lived here 4 years. There is not maintenance person. If you rent you have to fix everything on your own. Have gotten broken into twice. Stole play stations, tvs,. The laundry room has also gotten broken into. The rent checks have also been stolen per management. Very very unsafe neighborhood. Other than that rent is really cheap. Lol< /text>

Ghetto garbage place with worse people. Only a few nice people in this cesspool of a mobile home park. Staff is the worst element there.< /Text>

<rate>1</rate><Text>.Well, we don't have a manager.
No one is here to take care of the park.
Homeless come is and out as if was thier home. This park it's very unsafe.
With the temperature over 100° degrees the swimming pool its closed. The weeds are getting larger and larger.
The park does not require the tenants to keep their yards clean.
It's like living in a third world country but the park wants to charge new comers 900 dollars a month for rent, they really think this place its worth 900 dollars a month.< /Text>< pictures>

Skippy the assistant manager, He is a miserable old man who harasses the tenants & guest every chance he gets. This could be a nice mobile home park but this guy makes this place feel like a jail because nobody wants to be outside< /text>

(Translated by Google) This mobile park looks a bit run down and needs some attention, but it must be said that it looks very peaceful and safe to live in.

This restaurant has been here since the 80s and my family and I used to come here about 10 years ago. I have since moved out of state and I just had to visit on my last trip to California this week. I am so glad I did. The quality is the same! Amazingly fresh fish. Do not come here if you are looking for the "Americanized" Sushi. This is traditional raw fish on rice, known as Nigiri. Don't skimp and order the Aki Special (who is the owner and head sushi chef). The Aki Special is his take on the "dynamite" and way better! Baby shrimp, scallops, crab, and mushrooms baked in Japanese mayo! You're missing out every time you go to another restaurant and not here.

Pictured: Salmon Nigiri, Baked Mussels, Aki Special, and the complementary ice cream at the end to help cleanse your palate. Not Pictured: the Nigiri I ate before taking a picture LOL.</Text>

Very nice place that isn't the hustle and bustle of other sushi places. If you are looking for hip this isn't it. If you are looking for good sushi in a relaxed environment this is it. They are also Dodger fans so the TV has them on when they are playing. Try the soft boned chicken and the miso mackerel on the appetizer menu.<//Review>

Been coming here since the 90's, Aki "owner chef" is the real deal. He buys the best quality fish and his service is second to none. It's a hidden gem worth keeping and sharing. Taking a date or the family night out it's the spot for any occasion.<//Text>

The quality of the fish is top notch, very fresh. The salmon was buttery delicious. The Dodger roll was bomb. The nigiri piece of fish was huge, you could wrap the rice with the fish. So good. Coming back for sure!<//Text>

One of the first Sushi bars in the South Bay. Original owner over 20 years. Japanese chef trained in Japan. Very rare today. Traditional, good quality, great service. Still one of the best in South Bay.</text>

< review>
I was in the area for an event and wanted a quick dinner at Hakata Ramen, but I'd found that I'd gotten there too early and Hakata wouldn't be open for another 30 minutes! This place was right next door and I noticed they were open--problem solved. It's a small, neat and clean but unassuming-looking place, but I soon found out that I had wandered into a little gem. I was the first one there for the night and sat at the sushi bar. The chef, Aki, is kind of reserved, but he's a wiz with a sushi knife. I just started ordering everything that sounded good: Scallop, salmon, yellowtail (best), uni, spicy tuna handroll, ikura sushi, and finally the "Aki special"--basically a seafood dynamite that was very tasty. There's something so magical about baked Japanese mayo mixed with masago (smelt egg), yum. The fish was fresh and the portions generous. They even gave me a complimentary sorbet at the end--it was orange creamsicle-like and delicious! There was just one waitress working there at the time but she was very nice and efficient, no complaints at all with the service either. Sometimes when things don't go as planned you end up discovering something great! I will definitely return.< /review>

<review>Salmon nigiri- loved it! fatty, fresh, and melts in your mouth.
Octopus nigiri- yuck! Way chewy!
Yellowtail nigiri- mediocre
Dodger Roll- too much sauce that it overpowered the albacore. Rice didn't stick together and was falling as I picked up the sushi.
Spicy Tuna roll- meh. Not fresh at all and pretty bland.
Crispy chicken karage- no flavor. Just deep fried bits of chicken pieces.

All this for almost 50 bucks with tips included.
Probably won't be back anytime. Next time I crave for sushi I'll just drive to West LA or J-town.
BTW, this place is tiny! There's only 1 big table that sits a party of maybe 5? Definitely not good for big groups.< /review>< gmapID>

<Review>Bomb food! I ordered the chicken and beef combo plate. It did not disappoint. This was my first time at this location and I will definitely be back to try more on the menu! The sauce is amazing! I was surprised at the taste. I am excited to bring my husband to come and try the food and tell all my coworkers as we work just around the corner. Definitely give this food a try, you won't regret it. I ordered online and it was simple and easy and my food was ready on arrival. I wasn't given a receipt or else I would of taken a picture of it. See my other reviews for more amazing places to try in the IE.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAyMCwnUKuAkKoTGb8I4ScWJKHn4sFn72cd6Ly=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMC5hzhvUn-vhhnTeDHpis4XN1nwR_157N2LMk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHrrYPcJwzGjeLer1Ny6PuYW7h7zmT-vFC07gQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPmLxALZTUctIAr4HHi4lvmyUsphpqhD8KWohu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0MHITC6CLP0fjhFWjgnLbQvPKQ6JEWZzuV1-m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfzi5HnzGGtPyZ7wtaCBJKU1P7RMAHIFpZ3LRc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dcafcbff4ba12f:0x80fa65d7d95af2b3</gmapID></record>

When I walked in not a single member of the service staff was wearing a mask—at this point I should’ve left. Mind you this was before the cdc even said we can take off our masks in some places. I was extremely hungry and only had 30 minutes for lunch so I stayed.

The food was abismal. The rice was bland. The meat was chewy and over seasoned. To top it off my food was drenched in what tasted like canned cheese. It’s drunk people food.<//review>

It's a decent place , my kids like it. Death taco is SPICY!!!🔥but I like spicy stuff . You have to sign a waiver that's how spicy it is. I usually get the ninja Cali burrito , I just feel like it's dry. It needs a garlic gochujang aioli . It's just to basic , maybe a little pico de gallo with an Asian type aioli or slaw with a rice wine vinegar base. I make bulgogi ,kalbi and gochujang wangz myself so I know good flavor. I'll still go here because of my kids and to support the local asian persuasion restaurants. It's still worth a try , I'm critical because I can cook, if you don't cook- this will be off the chain!!

I have to admit something. I used the bathroom for the very 1st time after coming to this place 4 times in the last year. I'm impressed with the cleaning and maintenance of their bathroom inside the establishment. It has me impressed, very good experience within maintaining cleaness. The food tastes really Great as well. I recommend level 2 or probably 3 for Spice. I want to also give a Shout Out to the 3 Employees working there on September 29th at the front clerk serving my food for my customer.<//Review>

This place is one if the best Mexican / Asian fusion spot in the IE. The Ninja Fries and Ninja Burrito are amazing. Parking is okay but worth it. They also have the Death Taco Challenge. If you finish the taco you get your name on their Wall of Flame.</text>

<Text>Food was actually good. Food is a fusion of japanese and mexican. Portions are actually really good for the amount you pay. I would recommend this place because it has one of the better chicken bowls in riverside. You get a free taco and a drink when you post their flyer on social media.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdmUjVl2hy95aHRwHaETPj0lnD9bInOaHBuEgr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSx8HTG3DedX_qC8swqJsTp_3yBVp5kmrB4mBF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><response>None</response><rate>4<//rate><name>Sandy Wu<//name>< Gmap_id>

<review>One of the rare exceptions of fusion foods executed really well. Look beyond the novelty and you’ll be graced with good eats.

I’ve had the Ninja Cali Burrito, Ninja Fries, D-Bowl, Ninja Chicken Tacos, and even the Death Taco here, but I’ll save the details on that monstrosity for the other location’s review page. If I remember right, Genkiyaki’s media state that they use a teriyaki sauce. I’ve either been betrayed too often by inauthentic teriyaki sauce, or this isn’t teriyaki sauce at all. It’s not particularly soy sauce heavy and rather sweet and spicy in the literal sense, not the popcorn chicken dipping sauce sense. It reminds me a bit of galbi/kalbi marinade! The fries are seasoned almost like spicy BBQ chips, and are still even tossed in this seasoning rub while being laced with other sauces and toppings for the Ninja Fries. The bowl had a large portion of meat to rice amazingly. There was no skimping around here on any of the items! The tacos are a bit pricey though and not fantastic. Get tacos at more authentic joint, unless you’re jumping on the challenge. The only knock I can think of is that the flavour profile is very similar across the menu items, and the main difference between them is the choice of carb delivery. I think I prefer the burrito best. Also, there is a bit of heat in each item so if you’re not used to eating spice at all, expect just under sriracha levels of spice.

Friendly, quick service! The interior is basic and modern, with a wall showcasing the death taco challengers. It reminds me a bit of a coffee shop and there’s plenty of seating around for a group. You might get to spectate someone taking on the challenge as well and get to see if you want in on the action!

Definitely must try this joint. I wish it were closer to me so I can come more frequently!< /review><date>1550429551661<//date></record></dataset><record>

It was good, their spicy sauce was a tongue burner. They have a Taco challenge where you eat 3 SPICY Tacos and you get to be on their Wall of Fame. Seems pretty fun to try out the challenge. I want to try it in the near future after I try more of the food items on the Menu. My friend had thei Shrimp Tacos, I did not get to try it out but he told me it was really good. He recommended the place. Interior of the restaurant is cool, I like the Ninja them inside. Right off of University Ave in Riverside. By UCR, parking is a bit tough but overall a good experience.</review>< pics>

A+ lunchtime spot. Try to get there a little earlier than 12:30 if you want to be back to work in time as it can get busy. The ninja sauce is definitely worth adding!</text>

If you like potentially super hot and spicy food, this place would be at least a "try once" location. The Ninja burrito was good but the flour tortilla wrapping was a bit hard. The Ninja plate was . . .standard but nothing exceptional. If you so dare, and are willing to take some punishment, the death taco or *gulp* zombie burrito, are novel items to try. I steered clear but another in our party tried the taco and only felt heat as it just scorched all taste buds.<//review>

The first time I ordered food here, it was very good.
I ordered food for the second time today and it made me incredibly ill for what has now been three hours.
The only explanation I can think of is that the meat went bad in the burrito and made me sick.

Is it worth the risk? Probably not.
Will I order food from them again? Definitely not.<//Review>

I went with my friends (they've been multiple times) for the first time on a friday night. Wasn't busy at all so we got our food fast. I ordered the combo bowl, everything was great except for some of the steak was burnt to a crisp. My friends got the ninja chicken fries and let me try em and they were bomb. One of my friends told me that im with two fat people and I should always listen to them when it comes to food.<//review>

They had everything but the kitchen sink in it and it didn’t work for me. The ninja fries were amazing tho! A play on carne asada fries but with an Asian flair. Check business hours, they cater to the university students so they open late but they stay late too!</text>< pictures>

The food was okay but OMG we went in  and there were like four guys with DJ tables not playing music but just scratching records to a lame beat very loudly that I had to yell to just order. I don't mean these four guys took turns at the scratching...nope!!! Each one had a table to scratch a damn record simultaneously. I left with a bad headache and couldn't even enjoy my food. My husband and I won't go back and won't recommend to anyone.<//text>

I tried the regular ninja tacos. Taco Tuesday special. They were ok and the sauce was good. I need to go back and try the other SPICY ones and a few of their other menu items. Am sure I will give them more stars when I do.<//review>

THIS IS AN "OH MY GOODNESS!!! THIS IS GREAT FOOD" place!!! First time there and LOVED IT!! We had the beef nacho fries, beef tacos, Ninja Plate with ribs, chicken, and beef, rice, and crisp, fresh green salad... So much food, we have left overs for another meal. SO DELICIOUS and freshly prepared. I hope they open a location in Ontario/Eastvale area. 😄</review>

<Text>First time coming here, I had the full size half and half ninja fries (you normally have the choice of chicken or beef), they come with onion, cilantro, and ninja sauce which is their house sauce it's a mix of sweet and spicy but leans toward spicy in my opinion. They were very delicious an extremely filling for $8.50, I also had the gyoza which met my expectations of good gyoza. The guy behind the counter was a bro for letting my dad and I still order off the dollar menu even though when it came in it was a minute past the deadline (I didn't even consider it, he brought it up). My friends ordered a California burrito and chicken quesadilla, they both said they felt they got their money's worth regarding quality and how filling it was. Definitely would come again.<//Text>< user_name>

<review>The coveted 5 star! Any place that can make something called "Death Taco" actually taste bomb, deserves a high rating.  My sis had seen this place on social media a lot as of late, and seeing as how we are from the area, we decided to give it a whirl.

The Death Taco challenge is pretty simple, 1 super spicy taco eaten to completion, 10 minutes with no beverage. Surprisingly this taco really did taste great. If Genki cut out the spice, this is definitely a taco I would eat
regularly.  The spice on this thing set on pretty quick, but fizzled out after about 5 minutes. The girl behind the counter said that me and my sis handled it as good as anybody she has ever seen. Well now you reading this may seem optimistic by this point. We had won the challenge easily. By ten minutes, the spice was completely gone. This is where things took a turn for the worse. At around fifteen minutes both of our stomachs
were in knots. I went to the restroom and threw up. When I came out my sis was gone and she was a few doors down eating ice cream. Well death came-a-knockin on her door next. Since shes a lady, I wont get into details. All in all our stomachs were in major pain for about 4 hours.

Anybody can tap out of the mouth spice, but there is no tapping out of stomach pain. Tread with caution.

While we were there, we had plenty of time to see the other food coming out of the kitchen and it all seemed amazing. I will definitely be coming back to try it all!

Until next time...< /review><user_id>103960026898958587973< /user_id>< resp>

< Review>
Had an order of beef ninja fries, a furious chicken, and cali burrito. Calling the food mediocre is a stretch. The "ninja" sauce tries to sneak attack your taste buds by overloading them with sugar and salt to mask the lack of nuance. It is way too sweet and tastes like bad teriyaki sauce mixed with bad sweet and sour sauce. The meats were overcooked and dry. The fries limp. The rice dry and stale tasting.

The burrito was also pretty gross. It's like a garbage burrito where they just stuff as much random ass stuff in it to hide the fact that nothing individually has good flavor.

The fries were limp and overly seasoned with Lawry's salt, which is totally unnecessary since they're smothered in nacho cheese and salty meat, and topped with way too much of their "ninja" sauce.

Also, I asked for 3 "drops" of their death sauce when they asked, but the server insisted on only 2. It was not spicy at all. Next time the customer is a jerk and insists on 3 drops, just give it to them and let them suffer the consequences of their stubbornness, or in this case, insistence that they could handle it.

Oh, and the inside of the restaurant smelled like a casino full of stale cigarette smoke. Yummmmmy.<//Review>

<Text>Went in to get a bike for the GF on Halloween. Casey(Sp?) in the Waldo costume helped us look for a bike she liked, let us test drive, and just answer all our questions, since this is our first non big-box store bike. Great experience, can't wait to pick up the bike in a week.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< userid>

The wheel you sold me wasn’t much more than if I bought it it on Amazon, but the two tools I would have needed to buy to fix my own would have doubled what it cost to have you guys do the work. You interrupted your other work to do this 10 minute fix. And you didn’t charge me the full labor costs. I appreciate your service and recommend your shop to anyone who needs bike help.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Time>

When asking them they said they did not have the bike. REALLY THEY DID NOT BOTHER TO TELL ME AFTER THREE DAYS. Anyways they changed the bike to a different color and waited 3 more days. FINALYY I HAVE MY BIKE AND ITS THE BEST THING EVER THANK YOU SO MUCH. I was mad but they made up for it and the bike was better then the one I originally wanted. I will be coming back for all my bike needs.<//Text>< gmapID>

Great shop! I needed a shifter for my MTB and they did not have one in stock so instead of making me wait to get it they took one off of a new bike on the floor. GREAT customer service! I will be making more purchases in the future from Eden Bikes!< /Text>

Friendly and helpful neighborhood bike shop. I came in with a dodgy front rotor and the guys sorted me out. Had to make a quick call to Canyon to authorize the repair and the tech explained everything to the rep and I was out the door with a new rotor and ready to ride. Thanks guys!<//Text>

They are very customer driven, so you get the attention you deserve.  They have on-site repair shop, so things are addressed right in house.  They carry name brand bikes with many different models and types, so you have choices.  Their prices seem to be fair for what you get in both quality and service.<//text>

Didnt purchase anything then but the staff was incredibly helpful in helping me gauge price range the style, the quality to fit my riding style. Came in today and similar experience the service is incredible. They again helped me in deciding which bike I wanted to get they know their stuff that's for sure!

<Text>I stumbled upon this bike shop in search of an electric bike and am so glad I did. Chris helped me order and assemble my dream bike and even delivered it to my house. I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase and the service I received from Eden Bicycles, top notch!!<//Text>< pics>

I've been shopping here for something like 6 years and have always been impressed by their service, expertise and friendliness. All small stores should be like this place.  NO ONE in the East Bay can beat their service!< /review>

(Translated by Google) It is a nice place and John is very kind, friendly and helpful. He is the boy who helped me with the service of my bike. He was very honest with his service as he told me what I really needed and what I didn't and by giving me suggestions and explanation of failures. Perhaps the price is a bit high but I think it is worth it for the treatment received and his effort to make himself understood with the little Spanish he handles and my little English that I speak. Nice job. Thanks a lot

Es un bonito lugar y John es muy amable, simpático y servicial. Es el muchacho que me ayudó con el servicio de mi bici. Fue muy honesto con su servicio ya que me dijo lo que realmente necesitaba y lo que no y al darme sugerencias y explicación de las fallas. Tal vez un poco alto el precio pero creo que lo vale por el trato recibido y su esfuerzo por darse a entender con el poco español que maneja y mi poco inglés que domino. Buen trabajo. Muchas gracias</Review>

<Review>I’ve had pretty decent care of here but the only thing I’m a little upset about is their website says they are open on Saturdays from 8 AM to 4 PM yet when I tried to call right now it says they are closed. It would be nice if they could at least update the website so I wouldn’t waste my time.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Disappointed to the point, I refuse to see another doctor. I had to wait a month to get lab results. They focused more about my weight. They were only caring more about the Hispanic patients. If you’re overweight, expect bias. If you’re not Hispanic, expect bias.< /Review>

Lots of great visits here for my family. Dr. Jay is great with my kids. I've been coming for years and yes have experienced some rude Doctors unfortunately but I've experienced rude Doctors in other places too. I continue to come for the positive services I receive. Staff has always been nice and welcoming. Even have recommended other family members for services here.<//Text>

Could be better Drs. I went in today per the Drs request. I have been dealing with chronic pain and severe anxiety since 2003. Unfortunately because I am on Medi-Cal I don't get the same level of care as many other people. Overall I give this clinic and my primary Dr 3 stars. I understand their hands are tied and there's protocols to follow but one of my concerns I have been voicing vehemently for one yr now.</review>

I was really impressed with my first visit to this office and the doctor was very nice and attentive. That's where it ended. I have been waiting to hear about Physical Therapy for 3 weeks. I have called 8 or more times only to be told "I can forward the message" each time.
One person called me back after the first time I called and all that was left in the vm was "please call me back." I have heard NOTHING since then. My condition is getting worse because I am not in Physical Therapy. And I 100% blame these doctors because they can't make a simple 2 min phone call. I would even come in for an appointment if I thought it would get them to tell me what I need to know. I will be promptly changing doctors. Dr. Chandra is very nice in person but she is obviously overloaded if she doesn't have 2 minutes to call or time to delegate for someone to call me with the information I've been waiting for. They clearly don't know the meaning of "follow-up patient care."</Review>

Will schedule wrong type of appointments. Waited 2 months for the next available appointment so I could get my medication when I arrive im told my doctor cancelled many days ago and I wasnt called or notified so they fit me in because of their mistake. the one doctor i do see addressed none of my concerns and she just writes me down for another appointment with a specialist 1 month later.  When I got into my car I realised I had told them I wanted appointment with a specialist when i scheduled it in the first place. what a waste of time this place is i called another place and got a appointment 2 days from now
What took 2 months here took 2 days at another place<//text>

<Text>Sorry, but this place is a JOKE!
Mental health referred these guys to me so i could get some counseling for depression. I met with a counselor by the name of Julisa. At first she was nice, and told me how to get food stamps and Medi_Cal. Three times they cancelled my appointments, the third time I was standing there at my scheduled appointment time. "Your appointment has been cancelled, we tried to call you but your phone has been disconnected". AND WHILE I WAS STANDING THERE, SHE CAME OUT TO GREET A PREGNANT HISPANIC. She seen me and didn't say a word to me. I knew it was over between us. So I asked for a different Dr. they gave me Dr. Howard. He would never shake my hand, and always looked at his clock. On my first visit he asked me how long have I had schizophrenia? So I went home and told my family and friends, "oh that's whats wrong with you"? was their reply. But my next visit he denied saying that to me, "you got something but I'm not sure". He taught me that I could turn the same food dish into Spanish or Italian just by adding basil or other ingredients to change the flavor! What a JOKE! So I quit going altogether.
But Gloria, the greeter at the front door, is a sweetheart!
I am going to miss Gloria!</Text>< Resp>

<text>Thorough, caring professionals really went the extra mile to make sure they found out WHY my child was ill and to correct the problem instead of just treating the symptoms and calling it good. Dr. Mangondato was amazing. My child felt like someone really cared what was happening to them and wanted to help. Hands down, the best care in Stockton.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Worst medical clinic I been to I got like 5 minutes late to my appointment the lady's just didn't let me see the doctor saying that I had to be there 15minutes before  so I tried to reschedule my appointment they wanted to schedule me til April saying that that was the earliest appointment they had. So I just be looking for a new primary doctor don't recommend this place the employees are very unprofessional well unless you're their relative or neighbor that way they treat you right< /Text>

One of the worst medical places I've ever been to. Very rude and unprofessional employee's.  My time was wasted a number of times at this place all because their employees don't communicate with eachother.  I been waiting now for almost 4 months for the Dr's "assistant" to call me back to schedule an appt for surgery and nothing. Last time I received a call from her the assistant was very rude and had no class what so ever. They must not like their job that much by the way they treat their patients. I definitely will not be going back here.<//Text>

<Pics>None</Pics><user>107681730751705436578< /user><Text>First of all i schedule appointment, and was given an appointment that was after 1 1/2 month which means after about 45 days, and then a day before the day of appointment (on 44th day after i scheduled appointment) i received a call from the channel medical center, and i was told that since doctor is going on vacation, we are re-scheduling your appointment for after 2 months, and that was seriously another 2 months. I was actually burned down when she was giving me dictation about rescheduling appointment. Anyways, i said OK although not satisfied internally and feeling completely broken inside for the kind of treatment i received, and when  I visited this place, my experience there was even more horrible. To me it seems as if the clinic was run by inexperienced assistants to doctors. My personal understanding was that there wasn't any experienced "MD (Doctor of Medicine)" was working there, and the person i met didn't even know how to spell correctly, so i thought the same moment i am not going to come back, never ever again. Hopefully this review will help people to understand. And i request the government to take notice of the situation, and regulate these clinics and urgent care centers. People's health does matter, and getting health care from inexperienced assistants to doctors is not the right way of getting treatment for health problems. These clinics without experienced practitioners seems more of a business, and less of a health care facility. I feel extremely sad after this situation.</Text>< resp>

<Rate>2</Rate><review>(Translated by Google) It seems like a market when they pass you to take the blood pressure, the "doctor's assistants seem to be at home speaking loudly, laughing a lot. They don’t have any respect to the patients.

Parece un mercado cuando lo pasan a uno a tomar la presión de sangre , las “ asistentes de doctor parecen que están en su casa hablando  muy alto la voz,  laughing a lot. They don’t have any respect to the patients.< /review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) I am coming because I am pregnant but I do not recommend it at all there is a nurse named Linda and I attended 2 times and is very rude apart as he does not know what he does because I was changing my information for urine test. Anyway, the doctor does not look at you when you go is a nurse.

(Original)
Estoy llendo porq estoy embarazada pero no lo recomiendo para nada hay una emfermera se llama Linda y m atendido 2 veces y es muy grosera aparte como k ni sabe lo k hace porq m estaba cambiando mi información para examen de orina. En fin ni la doctora te mira cuando vas es una enfermera.<//text>

Love this park particularly for a walk in the park with my Lab. The up and down terrain is good to tire out my dog in a couple of rounds around the park. In the weekends RC racers can be seen racing their model cars in there park. Very family friendly park<//Review>

Probably ok for child outings but not great for bird hikes: Maybe I missed it with GPS and Google Maps but could only find the east branch of a trail, not the longer west branch, going maybe one-fourth of a mile to a private fence.</Text>

I have gone to this park since 1987. Great park for picnics and get togethers. Bees can be a problem in the picnic bench area.when food is available. Bring bee repellent.  Lots of dog walkers. Grassy area is large enough for sports and games but is not level......a little hilly. Enjoy Linda Vista Park.<//Text>

<Text>There is a old man with a power wheel chair has a dog named something with a L. Always off leash attacked my puppy when I confronted him he laughed and said "it takes two to tango." Lied and said he is not from there claimed from Chicago. He was wearing a trump hat. He is the worst.< /Text>< Pics>

This is honestly the best dentist office for kids and teens, no exaggeration. Such a welcoming, calm environment and EVERYONE is always so nice to you from the moment you walk in.
My brother has Down syndrome and is non verbal. He has always had a hard time at the dentist, wont even sit in the chair. Once at another office, they even tried to tie him down. But we’ve been coming to this office for a few years now and its been such a different experience.
My brothers needs are ALWAYS first and they come down to his level. Since he cannot communicate his needs with words, my brother’s anxiety manifests in a physical way. Panic sounds, jittering, hands spasms. But everyone here have always been patient and understanding.
Fun songs, calming words, just all around a delightful experience. And Dr. Sheikh has such a loving and soothing presence, my brother is instantly at ease.
A few weeks ago he had his 6 month appointment. And at the end of it, he finally for the first time sat in the dentist chair. On his own time and with their help making it fun.
I was actually brought to tears.
Do yourself a favor and bring your kids here. Its honestly the best, non traumatic experience you can give your kids. I am always so grateful every time we leave.<//Review>

I brought my granddaughter in after she complained of tooth pain.  She was visiting from out of state but Dr. Sheikh was able to see her and evaluate her issue.  Dr. Sheikh found that my granddaughter needed extensive work done but DCD&O/Captain Floss waited for me to obtain insurance for my granddaughter so her teeth could be repaired with little out of cost expense for my husband and myself and in a manner most comfortable to my granddaughter.  The procedure went very well and she is so happy with her new smile.  DCD&O/Captain Floss are so professional and kind.  Whenever my granddaughter visits I will bring her here for all her dental needs.<//Review>

Captain Floss is true to his name!! The trumpets sound when he walks in the room! He truly does save the day. He is quick and professional. His expertise is obvious by how calm and kind he is and knows straight away what to do. He shows he truly cares for children. I have taken my son in for a couple of dental emergencies that very day and he takes care of everything THAT day, there is no waiting. I have brought in my son for the sedation dentistry and Captain Floss took care of my sons 6 fillings under an hour! He is the true superhero of dentistry, thanks Captain Floss!!</text>

My kids love it here. When I tell them we are going to the dentist 🦷 they get so excited! I never felt that way as a kid. I am so happy we found Discovery Children’s Dentistry & Orthodontics.
Everyone who works here is positive, professional and very friendly. The Dr. has REAL conversations with the kids about the X-rays, flossing and even how they are doing in school and sports. He is the very best dentist.</text>

My kids have been patients of Dr. Sheikh’s since before they started school and are now graduated or in high school.  The office staff have always been courteous and helpful especially when it comes to scheduling all three on the same day.  If I have questions about billing or in need of paperwork for insurance-they are very helpful and readily available to assist me with my concerns. Dr. Sheikh and his staff are so patient with my kids and my boys have yet to show fear when going in for their dental visits.  Thank you Discovery Children’s Dentistry for all you do!<//text>

Amazing! So glad I chose this dentist. Dr Sheike and his assistant are incredible. My little girl didn’t cry or complain even once. Every time she started to get a little nervous they picked up on it and put her at ease right away. Like toddler whisperers! They were also super understanding and non judge mental, so fear not if you are late in taking your little one in for their first check up, like me!<//Review>

It seems to me that if your kids don't mind going to the dentist then that dentist is doing excellent work. As a parent, that's invaluable.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I love the colorful rooms and paintings, especially the open room with 4 chairs where the kids can be together. And there was a places for mom to sit with the other child and our stuff. Very comfortable. The staff was great. But the most impressive thing was when my little girl got 2 fillings for the first time, she didn't even feel the shot, and with the happy gas and her show, it was easy for her to be brave. It was just as easy as the cleaning. She's not even nervous for her next visit. My kids felt very at ease around the dentist.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>It’s been so hard for us to find a honest and caring dentist! I have three kids! And each of them has been so thankful for this place! The dentist does not try to push for any extra work to be done and has told us to even hold off on something’s and see what happens. Whereas other offices push so hard for anything they can find and charge so much more than needed. Such a sweet place!!! Front office is great too!</Text>< pics>

I highly recommended this place I love there service and made it pretty easy and welcoming for my 2 older daughters. My 6 month baby started teething I ask the Dr. while doing our   Regular check up what can help my baby and he suggested me the perfect teething snack.</text>

<text>We are visiting from out of town, our 2 year old crashed on his bike going down a hill and one of his front teeth got knocked loose. I googled children’s dentist near me and these guys popped up. I called the doctor after hours and he was very sweet and reassuring. He told me that kids bounce back easily and if I could get a picture to send it to his number personally. I couldn’t get a decent picture until the morning, but when I did, I sent it to him and he suggested we come in and gave us the available times via text. We went in and he took an X-ray and then looked in his mouth and we decided it needed to be removed. We were in and out in 30 mins, we don’t have dental insurance but I feel what he changed us was fair. His staff was incredibly nice and very good with my little guy! If you need a dentist I’d highly recommend these guys! To bad they don’t do business in our home town! Thanks Dr and staff! You were wonderful!</text><Name>Jessica Mandile< /Name></record>

Such a clean,  Friendly place :) My kids felt comfortable instantly.  My little guy went in for what we thought was a cavity and ended up being a loose tooth. To my surprise, my little guy who is a bit of a strong willed child, was super giddy and relaxed the entire time of the cleaning, X-rays and with the dentist:)

Wonderful experience overall! My boys said on the car ride home "next time we have to go to the dentist, lets go back there:)"<//Review>

Office staff and Dr. Wong were always happy to accommodate, squeezing your child in last minute at your preferred time and spending extra care time with her.\n\nBilling insurance for services not rendered is completely ILLEGAL and is a practice that we do not partake in. A ledger of services was emailed to you immediately after you had requested. Our orthodontic software does not provide the exact same paperwork as our pediatric software does, as mentioned to you over the phone. We apologize if any phone call was not returned. We made it a priority to return each and every phone call of yours in a timely manner on some days up to 4-5 times a day, however at times do we get very busy.\n\nDr. Wong is saddened by your experience, but hope’s that you find the best treatment possible for your child in the future."}< /response>< text>
Dr.Wong is very kind but her skills in orthodontics is poor.  We had problems with fitting an appliance in my daughters mouth and had to return several times and still had problems.   There was no resolution.
The office staff has inadequate skills.  My insurance was over billed on several occasions for work that never took place.  They are also refusing to refund any of it.   I asked for an itemized list of the billing  but they would not provide it to me .   I also asked for a phone call back and that never happened either.   I have left several messages but have not received any information back .   It is a very poor way to run an office and then bill for services that were never rendered .  I asked for the dentist to call me back but have  never received a phone call.<//text>

One of my kids has autism and is afraid of doctors and dentist offices. Dr. Sheik has been extra patient with him, he takes time with him each visit for my son to calm down, he even let's him check out the equipment. I recommend this office to everyone who asks me.

My daughter has been going to Dr. Sheikh since he was at his other location and she was a young child.  We are from Oceanside and drive to Carlsbad just to go there.  My daughter is now 14 years old and Dr. Sheikh and his staff handled my scared small child with great care and I wouldn't change dentist for anything and neither would she.< /text>

Active Duty military stay away until they get their billing practices in order. Dr. Sheikh is a good dentist and the staff are genuinely caring but the billing practices and office manager require a warning to potential customers.

Summary: Dentist is trying to recoup claims from patients after the insurance company denied for failure to submit within 12 months of service. Per their contract with MetLife they are not allowed to do this. When challenged regarding the validity of the bill the office waives this particular charge and magically finds others in my account from 2 years ago which had never been mentioned....Reported to the MetLife fraud department. Contact your insurance company before paying them any new charges on old services.

Details:
My dependents were patients in this clinic until we PCS'd summer of 2015. In January of 2017 we received a bill for services rendered in Feb/March of 2015 (nearly 2 years after the date of service).

I found this a bit odd so I decided to call and request an explanation for the late invoice. I was told by Discovery Children's Dentistry that they had sent the bill to MetLife on multiple occasions but the claim had been rejected. Discovery Children's Dentistry proceeds to tell me I am still responsible and sometimes this happens on occasion. Upon request they sent a detailed invoice and history of our family account. This claim was stated as the only outstanding charge.

I decided to call MetLife because something did not sound right. After giving MetLife the usual information to confirm my identity they are able to pull up the exact claim Discovery Children's Dentistry is referring to and admit that they denied the claim because the dentist failed to file the claim within the allotted window (12 months). I was then told that under the contract signed between the dentist and the insurance company if the claim does not reach MetLife within 12 months after the date of service they are allowed to deny reimbursement. Also, if the dentist is denied reimbursement because of their negligence (timeliness) then they are not allowed to attempt to recoup cost from the patient. MetLife said if the dentist had an issue they were more than welcome to call and discuss the claim.

I sent this information to Discovery Children's Dentistry via email requesting acknowledgement of receipt and a request that they void all charges. No Reply.

I then called Discovery Children's dentistry back and relayed the information provided by MetLife. The dentist said they would waive the debt for "professional courtesy" but denied lying about submitting it on multiple occasion's within the required time frame.

I thought it was finished.....

I then received a written statement in the mail that documented the removal of the erroneous charges but contained additional charges for services performed on another dependent within the same time period.

The dentist removed one set of charges because they had to (in accordance with the contract they signed) but then added charges for another dependent nearly two years after we leave the state.....when does it end?

If you receive a bill that seems strange get an itemized list from Discovery Children's Dentistry and call your insurance provider before  paying the charge. It may not be what it seems.< /review>

<Review>GO TO THIS STORAGE UNIT!

Great prices and ths staff at this facility are extremely helpful, just make sure to book online for the best deal. No joke they will make an effort to make your move in smooth and easy!

Marta helped us when we first moved in and gave us advice on how to store our furniture to make sure nothing broke while we were renting. Melanie helped us out during our move out and was just a down to earth person. You won’t be treated like a number here, the staff will remember you even after a year from your move in date. There are other public storage’s in San Diego but go to this one, you won’t regret it.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Well listen...sometimes life happens and in a hurry you have to move stuff, store and sometimes you simply want it out of the house lol! In my occasion I needed a safe place to store my stuff for a bit. VERY important to me is that is it clean, no bugs or critters....whatever those are, and that I can feel SAFE. This place was it for me. Started with a very friendly and knowledgeable Manager Martha. She gave me some options on the very cool and new pad screen to figure out my needs. This made it easy for me to choose a size. She told me the upgrades on the new app with TOUCHLESS options to get in the gate and the elevator!! TOUCHLESS!! I MEAN WHAAAAT! True folks I was a witness. She Gotta eat, wanted to put in my 2 cents on my expewalked me to my unit as well. See She made it even better with her great customer service....who even gets customer service now a days... Wow, this was long . Gotta eat, just wanted to put in my 2 cents . Have a great day! Check out this place for  your storage  needs,  say hi to Martha she is awesome and stay safe everyone!< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Just had to stop by to say some great things about this facility and staff.
Melanie has been professional, friendly, courteous and helpful throughout our time. Everytime we stop in during business hours she is tending to the faculty. It is very clean and  bug free. Plenty of space to get in and out of our units. Reasonably and competitively priced. Trust when I say, my husband and I are experienced in moving and storing, literally across the country. We feel very confident in our decision to rent here. So should you. Although we haven't had much experience with Martha. We can tell she is a doll.< /text>< Response>

Marta is the BEST! I’ve had a difficult time finding a unit that fits the specifications I need for my business at other storage facilities. Marta was able to streamline everything and get me exactly what I needed, quickly, efficiently and with great customer service. Thank you!<//review>

<review>My fiancé and I have had nothing but great experiences with the storage facility. It’s centrally located in a convenient and quiet business area which makes getting in and out a breeze. The staff is always friendly and helpful! We were there picking up our Christmas decorations and completely blocking the entire aisle today (because of course they were in the very back and underneath everything else) when Angela came by doing her rounds. She was super nice and didn’t even comment on the mess that we had made trying to dig our decorations out of the depths of our locker, instead she made conversation about the holidays and asked us if there was anything we needed which was super nice! A big Thank you to Angela for checking in with us today, hope you have a wonderful holiday season!< /review>< Pictures>

It only takes a few minutes to get through the process and there’s never any hidden costs or unreasonable charges. The storage spaces are clean and well maintained, but I’d recommend getting a moisture absorber as the enclosed space could trap moisture and cause mold. Though, that hasn’t happened yet. Overall, great value & customer service!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>We were in a hurry of getting a place to store our stuff because we had an emergecy . We saw that they have a promotion that you can pay $1 for the first month, but the first location we went to did not have the promotion. The front desk person we didnt get her name but shes from the chula vista branch, help us look for a branch that has the discount and also help us figure out the size of the storage that we need. When we got to the location that was recommended to us, the front desk person Melanie was very friendly and helped us right away. In times like this with covid and the problem that we were facing, a friendly person and her kindness really made a huge impact to us. I work in the customer service too so i understand how difficult it is, but Melanie went above and beyond for us and did the right thing. I was surprised on how good the customer service was. Really recommend public storage.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dbff924fa310db:0xcc583ee3b111a293</gmap_id>< pictures>

I went to the Public Storage on Raytheon Rd. I really didn't like the service and  when I did rent my space it had a big bar in the corner of my space. Today, I went to. vacate my space and there was no one there to help during business hours. They said that they were doing work in the office but there was still no help or management on the premises. This is a terrible place to rent a storage. I would not recommend this Public Storage to anyone. If I could give this place ZERO Star I would do that to get my point across.< /Text>

I really need it to give this storage five stars. Due to the Pandemic my financial situation changed and I was scared to lose my storage unit. A very nice lady who's name is Martha tooked the time to figure out my best options to keep a storage unit w all my properties. I feel so relieved now. I want to thank the Public Storage for having such a great employee who takes the time to find solutions and keep clients happy specially during this stressful time for everyone.<//Text>

🙋‍♀️I have done business with this Public Storage  for two years now having had two separate storage units. A very professional & pleasant representative, Martha 😃recently helped me switching to the awesome phone app access, 🙂 and initially 👉Mike 👈👍 went out of his way to make the rental simple & pleasant. I was happy with a promo I received as well when first renting! 😀This business is close to my home, easy to access, and the atmosphere is positive and highly secure. I heartily recommend you check this location before going anywhere else!< /text>

Mike was so helpful and attentive. I rented a unit in the beginning of the month and he was amazing. Out standing customer service. Thank you

I referred Public Storage to my long time friend and Sondra was not as cordial. Unfortunately she was not as helpful. Because Sondra was not as helpful in renting a second unit, unfortunately she loss his business. What a shame. No worries though! Mike is the bomb to deal with! He will really go out of his way to make you feel good! Thanks Mike!!! Out standing customer service!< /Review>

<text>Skip it. From day 1 the latch to my unit has been bent, takes forever to close. They won’t fix it.  Never any Security after hours office hours. 2 dollies locked up at 5 pm on the weekends hardly accommodates. But definitely try to sell me every product on the shelf. I would give this a 1 star but Melanie who set me up is wonderful.<//text>< Pictures>

Mike gave me great service when I rented my unit at Public Storage in Kerney Mesa! He explained everything very thoroughly and clearly so I could understand. The facilities are clean and very safe. He showed me around and let me know that if the smaller storage unit I’m renting doesn’t work out, I can upgrade with no additional cost. Also, the bathrooms were clean and comfortable compared to the other storage unit I use to rent. Huge thanks to Mike for helping me!!< /review>

I rented late last week, where I reserved my property online, so I can get the discount and with the first month rent for $1. It turned out the locker was too small.  However, with the same discounts I was able to get a locker double the size, and at the discounted rate indicated online.

The property manager, Mike, made this transition very easy for me, and made a great effort so I can feel comfortable with my transactions. He went out of his way to ensure I knew all of the necessary information I needed for my storage needs.

Before I arrived at Public Storage I was nervous about leaving my property in San Diego, where I will be working out of California.  However, after my experience with the property manager and rules that were clearly stated to me and where to look in the future, I NOW FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH MY PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA.

Thank you Public Storage.</text>

<Text>I've had two separate units here over the years. Though the facility might be a bit dated compared to others the customer service is very solid. On my most recent visit Mike was extremely helpful in helping me find a unit quickly and efficiently.

Definitely recommend this location.< /Text>< gmap_id>

The help was rude, passive aggressive, and extremely unprofessional.  The website said it was climate controlled and it is NOT~ there is no air conditioning so it is extremely hot & stuffy in the upper storages. I have used other Public Storages in the past and have been extremely happy, but I will never do business at this facility again.< /text>

Within minutes, Mike called me to confirm my reservation and answered all my questions. When I arrived to complete my rental agreement, He took me to my reserved unit, explained everything in detail, including storage tips. The unit and surrounding area is clean and well maintained. Mike’s professionalism and great customer service made me feel confident that I chose the right facility to store my belongings. Thank you Mike.</Review>< user>

<text>Absolutely horrible. Storage unit got broken into and they never alerted me that it was nor the fact that others were also. When it came time to deal with the issues of this, the district manager David was conveniently always out of the office when needed.

The manager, Maria, was very helpful and personable when she gave me a tour of the units. I'm actually really impressed on how tight and reassuring the security is. Super friendly staff and I'm a proud unit rentee.< /text>

Great price. But ridiculous policy if you lose your key and need to remove ur lock and put a new one. I was told I couldd not  remove it myself id have to hire a locksmith and have it picked open with manager present. Luckily I found my key.<//Text>

I have had a large storage unit here for 1 1/2 years. It has been a very pleasant experience for us. The facility is in a good central location and easy to get to. It is kept clean. They do security checks and notified me that I didn’t properly put the lock back on on one of my visits. I was able to get over and secure the space quickly. The staff has been very helpful answering questions. Pat, the resident manager, is always very pleasant. I would use them again in the future if the need arose.</Review>

Pat the manager here is the best. She helps us all the time with our many units, and finds us carts when we need them. They have been more than helpful for my business. Facilities are clean and tidy relative to other storage places we've used. Highly recommended.</Review>

<GmapID>0x80dbff924fa310db:0xcc583ee3b111a293< /GmapID><Text>Mike the property manager was very very kind and helpful. Ive been wanting to clear up the small space i live in for a while now and finally did, wish I'd done it sooner bc the energy in my space is so much better already and I'm still not finished. Getting a storage unit to clear your home space also lets you try riding yourself of excessive stuff without having to throw them away but allows you to realize you dont need as much as you think you do. That's why I say I wish I could've done it sooner. New year 2020 clearer vision and space thanks to public storage and the great online deal I got. I also purposefully got a bigger space than I thought I needed and I'm quickly filling it up with stuff I dint know I had and of so I dont need around to clutter</Text></record>

<Review>My experience renting storage in the past has not been a great one but once again in need of storage i decided to now give Public Storage a try, this was an extremely great decision! In the front office i was greeted by Ana who was very patient and kind, she took me out and showed me the facility as well as the unit size she recommended, every other office that i would walk in to seemed anything less than welcoming but Ana had a smile on her face from the minute we came in. Not only was the customer service great here but the cleanliness of this facility made it an easy decision to rent! I would definitely  recommend Public Storage to anyone looking to store! Thank you Ana!<//Review>< gmapID>

Jazmin made the move-in process smooth and simple, and I had the perfect storage unit in about 45 minutes. The facility is clean, secure, well-lit and well-kept - this is a great place to keep your things worry-free. So far billing has been accurate and on-time and the service is excellent. One issue: an earlier opening time on the weekends would be nice, since I like to start road trips before 9:30.</Text>

I had a very positive experience at Public Storage the other day, so I thought that I would write a review. The customer service was excellent! David was extremely helpful and willing to answer every question that I had. He was very personable and made me feel like my business was valued. I usually don't write reviews, but this was the exception. I believe that he is a true asset to this company and would refer this SPECIFIC location to any friends or relatives that need to lease a storage unit.<//text>

Went to check out my unit today & Jazmin was out in the property making sure customers where doing good and also was kind enough to give me a water bottle. It feels good to have employees that care about customers. Will be recommending this property to fellow friends.<//review>

A miss Angelica helped me today on quotes for the Raytheon location. Then she went the extra mile  by helping me with quotes on other locations in the area. She saved me time and gas from driving around. I am so thankful that there are still helpful people out there. Public storage is very lucky to have an employee like her. Thank you miss Angelica, and thank you Public storage!< /Text>

Do not choose this storage.  There is no cart for you to move boxes, and even when there appears to be one that one is locked. The place is also hot and humid, not suitable for storage.< /review>

Management NAME "MARIA". WAS AWESOME.VERY HELPFUL SINCERE,  TALK POLITELY,  DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB.  I give her by herself 5 STARS.
HOWEVER RESIDENTIAL MANAGER KATHY OLDER LADY.
REFUSED MY PAYMENT. YES SHE REFUSED MY PAYMENT.SHE BEEN RUDE THE WHOLE TIME I RENTED THERE.
SHE HAS AN ATTITUDE.  SHE DESERVES " 1 Star" .

Maria plus Kathy equals an 3 star. I dont think others should suffer for other managers bad attitude and REFUSAL OF PAYMENT.</Review>

<text>My experience renting the storage was great.  Everyone was helpful. However it appears they were more focused on explaining paying rent then they were at explaining what to do when you leave. I was just told that I had to pay an entire month although I was cleared out on the 8th. It was one of the fine print on the contract that was not gone over. The only thing mentioned was to come to the office and ensure it was cleaned out and that the lock was off. They then were going to vacate my unit and be able to resell it even though I just paid the month. Total corporate greed. Additionally they only had two carts so on many occasions I had to walk my stuff up one box at a time.<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dbff924fa310db:0xcc583ee3b111a293</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Thanks to Pat we were able to rent a unit today with total confidence.  Pat helped my wife and I to select the perfectly logical sized unit.  Shes been in the business long enough (16 yrs) to give honest and insightful answers answers to all our questions. Plus.....she is just a real nice person to know!  That is very important to us.  Our possessions are gaurded by someone that is reliable and trustworthy. We can just call anytime and Pat quickly and efficiently provides a clear response to our concerns.

Ms. Pat was thorough yet speedy. I was in and out in a matter of 35 minutes, with the paperwork and keys to my very affordable 10x12 drive up unit! I was also given a special on my first month's rent. Ms. Pat personally ensured I had access to the facility's grounds and eloquently answered all of questions/concerns.<//Review>

We rented a unit from property manager, Pat, who was extremely knowledgeable, professional yet customer friendly. The entire process
was quick, economically painless along with being conveniently located with great hours of operation.

Thank you Pat for making a tedious chore much more pleasant in such a fast manner.< /Review>

Awesome service and prices. Honestly can say they have the best rates in the area by a good amount. The manager, Pat, was very kind and went out of her way to show me around (only storage provider that has done that for me) she even helped me load my boxes into my car. These guys are great if you looking a storage space in the kearny/clairemont area.</Review>

I've used this location multiple times over the past 27 years for personal and business storage. Always clean, secure and well-managed. The present manager, Pat, is a jewel and will be your Storage Den Mother and a sympathetic ear for whatever afflicts you. And your stuff!< /Review>

This location is perfect for my business.  We have been storing here since 2011, and we have 2 garage-style units and 1 interior unit.  The property is always clean and well kept.   Pat is always friendly and very helpful.  I highly recommend this location.< /text>

<text>I have worked in customer service and hospitality. I've dealt with bad customers and have had bad service. This place is actually staffed with real people, not just salesmen.

David and Pat are always really great when I come in. I'm always greeted with a smile and they are genuine with their offer to help. Pat is super sweet and kind of reminds me of my mom. David is goofy and super helpful.<//text>< Pictures>

Quick! Easy! Cheap! Courteous!

I recently moved into town and needed a place to store my possessions. I didn't want to spend a lot of time researching and didn't need to. Public Storage easily had the best pricing in town. Simply booked my reservation online and minutes later Raquel called asking when I was available to "move-in".

Upon arrival she was courteous, efficiently got me through the paperwork, and I was moving my things out of my car and into my unit in what felt like mere minutes. Raquel even remembered me by name (not an easy task given how many people she must see in a given day) and was more than happy to help with issues I was having with my access code the following day. I'll continue to trust Public Storage with my belongings as long as they continue to employ people like her in the front office!<//Text>

They are always kind and friendly with tenants and they like to get to know who rents from them instead of making us feel like it's just a transaction. They need more people like them in customer service!</Text><gmap_id>0x80dbff924fa310db:0xcc583ee3b111a293< /gmap_id>< Rate>

I've used this facility for years, (out of convenience of location) off and on as needed and the cost always seemed reasonable.
*Unfortunately and disturbingly, the ownership has been raising prices steadily over the past couple years and in just a short while over $50.00????
*Also, you are FORCED to buy THEIR insurance and you can't get their insurance without the particular lock that they... of course sell on-site... very sneaky and BS customer service.
There is one shared bathroom on-site that reminds me of a few of the worst gas station bathrooms I've seen. The toilet paper was on the floor because the dispenser was falling apart. The paper towels were on the back of the toilet in one big roll you had to tear off a piece to use. Pure cruddyness!!!
For some odd reason (thoughtlessness) there is no ventilation in these buildings (if there is, it doesn't work and never has) so you are left to swelter as you try to work in sauna type heat.
I recently vacated my unit for the above reasons.<//text>

<Review>I had an awesome experience with Alexa .
She showed me kindness and concern one day during a heat wave.  I was working hard on getting my storage unit in order when Alexa came by and said " Miss Ann, it is really hot up here.  Are you drinking water?!  Please come down to the office and cool off, have some cold- water and rest awhile" !
I felt cared about.  Like I matter.  My life has been so complicated, it's comforting to hear that Alexa cares!!!  The staff at Public Storage shows me how amazing they can be!!!  Thanks!!!</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Text>Signed my rent agreement today with Dana's awesome customer service. Answered all my questions and concerns. Docked off points simply due to the fact that I was not made aware of all the extra fees like insurance. Also, the mattress bag that I bought has doubled in price since the last time I bought it in 2011. But this is more of an issue with the company rather than anything else</Text><Rating>4</Rating><gmapID>0x80dbff924fa310db:0xcc583ee3b111a293</gmapID><Resp>None< /Resp><user>107589852858261053839</user>< date>

This is not my first unit at this place. Always nice and pleasant and helpful at all of them I'm sure. Pat is very kind. The managers are well primed for the travesty of homelessness but very understanding to the issues that come with it. Noone wants to be treated badly, always kind.</review>

She showed us the storage units before we made our decision and ensured that we were renting the proper size unit for our needs.  All the paperwork was handled quickly.

There are two down sides at this location.  The first is that it does not have adequate interior lighting or ventilation on the inside units.  It is very hot, dim, and stuffy in the summer.

The second is that you must get out of your car to access the key pad at the gate.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>We chose this facility after researching our options. 10 years ago (due to sale of estate sale of a loved one)..... we told Pat in office "we only need storage for maybe 3 months....... "  well here we are still with a unit.   It is so safe and clean we kept adding our own personal treasures (depends who you ask....if you ask my kids it's junk...ask me it's stuff I might need)  yes rate has gone up yearly.... but  compared to other storage businesses .....location , quality and of course courtesy from all employees has been very nice... Thank you Pat we see you the most!

I'm an active duty Marine based at nearby Miramar, deploying soon. I arrived at 11am on a Sunday in order to reserve a storage unit, and was helped by Pat. She set up the rental well, but neglected to clearly state the ONLY gate hours in which you can access the unit. So when I arrived 5 hours later with an entire apartment's worth of stuff in a rented uhaul, the gate was closed and unable to be accessed.

I then called the Public Storage call center, where 2 different customer service reps told me incorrect information on the gate accessibility and even tried providing me a wrong access code just to get me off the phone.They then proceeded to read a script on how they are unable to help. Only useful info I was able to get was the district managers contact number. Basically wasted an hour on the phone with them.

I then came in the next day (Monday), and unpacked my things without trouble. After describing my difficulties to the office, they advised I call Brian, the district manager, for my complaints. We had already left him a message Sunday night (he didn't call back) but I called again on Wednesday to reach out. He answers the phone. He proceeds to tell me I should intrinsically know the gate hours since they are posted in sign form on the gate, and that they are also emailed in one of SIX emails sent that day.

According to Brian, that alleviates his employees from having to tell people when they can access their stuff, since it's posted elsewhere. I was hoping to get some sort of compensation for having to pay for an extra uhaul day, and having to miss a morning of work on base to deal with this, but he repeatedly said that my situation was not a fault of Public Storage. His words were "since the information was posted on the gate and also emailed to you, Public Storage isn't going to issue any credit for your inconvenience." Brian repeated this verbatim multiple times, and after I explained how his employee didn't tell me, his call center failed, and how it's a bit excessive to dig through 6 emails to find the most important piece of info for the whole rental, he repeated it once more and insisted that he's not going to continue to "talk in circles with you about this".

People , him and his company are not interested in helping you past the point of rental. Heaven forbid if you are military and are unable to be flexible. I cannot stress this enough. If things go wrong, Brian Berg is the type of manager to blame you or others. Do not reward places like this with your business.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Pat provided great service to us from the minute she set up an appointment over the phone all the way through switching to a different lock/clasp so that my fingers weren't fumbling around in frustration.   I walked away with exactly what I wanted.<//review>

<Review>The employees at the Public Storage on Raytheon Road in San Diego, California are either in need of retraining or should learn how to leave personal problems out of the workplace. I am in town for my wedding and decided to check up on the two storage units i rent at this location. My first visit was on Tuesday August 23rd. I showed up at the location at 5:25 p.m. to inquire about cutting the locks on my units, as the keys had been misplaced in the four years since I acquired the units. The office was closed (?) and a sign stated that the manager would be back at 5:30 p.m. so, I decided to wait. At 5:54 p.m., an employee arrived and unlocked the doors to assist the 3 customers who had been waiting along with me. Although I was slightly irritated, the gentleman was helpful. He informed me that the manager was the person who performed the lock cutting at no charge, but that the manager wouldn't be there until the next day. He took my name, number, and unit numbers and told me that the manager would contact me the next day. He told me that an alternative to get it done the same day would be to hire a locksmith. I opted to have the manager contact me as I wasn't in a huge hurry and would prefer to speak to him, should I have any questions or concerns about my units. The next day (August 24th), I hadn't heard from the manager so, I stopped by again between 12 p.m. and 12:30 p.m. The middle aged employee in the office informed me that she had received the note from the previous employee that I needed the locks cut. She told me that I hadn't been contacted because the manager hadn't come in and wouldn't be in until Friday, when I am set to fly back home. I reiterated to her that I was told the manager would be in, today, and that's why I came back, instead of hiring the locksmith the previous day and she proceeded to tell me that the manager has "many responsibilities and cutting locks is not one of them. He will cut the locks at his own convenience." I'm not sure what issues she's dealing with and I hope things get better for her, but her attitude was completely unnecessary. If I had been given the correct information at the beginning, i wouldn't had to have come and interrupt her busy day in the empty office. The office being closed during business hours, managers not showing up, and a lack of customer service skills is not good business. I'm sure Public Storage makes plenty of money, I just believe that apt employees would make more money for the company. This is a completely different experience from the one I had upon move-in, but that's kind of the way it goes, right?

Update: After some calling around, I was contacted by the District Manager, Brian. He is amazing!! He came down and met me at the storage property, the same day, and helped me get into both of my units. Brian reminded me why i've been happy to be renting from Public Storage the last 4 years. ❤❤<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dbff924fa310db:0xcc583ee3b111a293< /gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1472090660593<//Time>< username>

<Text>The staff at this public storage faciluty are dependable. They ioen and close when say and akways return my moms calla. I was removing items tiday and a different manager was asking hiw i was treated. I think her name was ginger or something like that. Very bubbly and informative. I waa glad to assist. Again my mother is old and deals with someone else and is happy.

You're really amazing of the rest! What I like about this bistro is that they simply have my sense of taste with regards to espresso and cakes. It is slightly below average, and it's extraordinary. You have the right to be known to many. Sit tight for me to prescribe your support of the entirety of my companions and get back here once more. Thank you kindly!< /review>

If you're searching for a coffee shop with freshly made pastries, this is the place to go! It includes free internet as well as a research facility within the coffee shop. Employees/waiters are frequently polite and cheerful. There was coffee on hand, and the cuisine was delicious. It has a reasonable pricing and a pleasant atmosphere. I wholeheartedly suggest this establishment!< /review>

<Review>Astonishing! The air and energy in this bistro are loosening up. The barista is genuinely bewildering as he sorted out some way to give me a dumbfounding latte craftsmanship. It was totally a surprising help that I will verifiably recommend to the total of my buddies. A really splendid spot to loosen up and like a sample of flavorful coffee. Fantastic!

This is really a beautiful spot to get some espresso. This spot truly merited more than five-star evaluations. Everything from their staff, inside plans, and surprisingly the administrations were extraordinary. A spot to continue to return to for increasingly more without fail. I strongly prescribe this bistro to everybody.<//Review>

In my neighborhood, I actually find a coffee shop. It's nice and heavy, with a full taste, and it's not as pricey as some of the others I've tried. They provide strong coffee and have helpful service. The atmosphere is wonderful, and the internet access is lightning fast. This coffee shop comes highly recommended by me to anyone who enjoys coffee.</Review>

Tiago has the best coffee and brunch in Hollywood, hands down! This place has been my DAILY coffee shop for most of 2020 and it's the lovely people who work here that keep me coming back every morning. Tiago is a shining star right at the end of Hollywood Blvd and I can't say enough good things about them. Be sure to get the breakfast sandwich and a cappuccino :)</review>

Nice place to spend time, seating at the outdoor tables. Food looks great, tastes either, but nothing special about their coffee for me, pretty plain taste, but looks for 5 stars definitely</Review>

Great food! Highly recommend this place. The day we came the waiters didn't come to work on time so they opened up a half hour later and we stood in line until they opened. To make it right they offered everyone waiting in line an amazing cinnamon bun. Everything we ate was fresh and delicious. Will be back! Great pastries and food.< /text>

By far one of the best Cafe spots in Pasadena. Not only is this spot downstairs from where I work, it's super dope! The vibe of the place is on point! Great music, a place to come hang out, study, or just take a break from clients. Sometimes I just come down to chat with the owner Lee. Super dope person. We always have great conversations. I highly recommend Art+Science Cafe if your looking for great coffee, tea's, the BEST hand roll sushi, and avocado toast! My go to is the Iced Caramel Latte with Oat milk.<//text>

<text>Dottie's is truly a gem. It has the greatest breakfast scrambles that are made with the freshest ingredients. The wait staff is so accommodating and friendly. True, it's not in the best of areas and there is almost always a wait. But it's well worth it! The Salmon scramble  and the Chorizo scramble are both delicious!</text>< Pics>

<review>Has really good options both base and topping! Service is super friendly too even late at night. Usually the options for a bowl are either  or pitaya but this has a few other options which were all amazing! I tried the activated coconut base for a change so it would t be too sweet and still loved it. Definitely coming back for more. Wish they expand to other locations eventually.</review>< UserId.>

Tiago Coffee Bar + Kitchen is such a cute little gem of a cafe I just found in Burbank!! It's towards the Toluca Lake side. It has a cute cozy feel with a nice well decorated outdoor patio. Red Maple is the type of cafe where you order up front, get a number and then sit down.< /text>

First time here. I had one of the best breakfast sandwiches ever accompanied by roasted potatoes with rosemary and a delicious pumpkin latte. Very filling breakfast which should hold me until dinner. I'll definitely come back.<//text>

I liked this place. Food was very good. Coffee was delicious :) Prices were decent. A lot of seating, inside & outside. Like the decor. It does need improvement on organisation. They don't seem to be in sync with the orders being sent out to tables and the kitchen. I received potatoes which were not mine. They happened to be from the previous customers and they already had left. When the waiter brought them to me, am like where's the rest of my food? Am I supposed to just eat the potatoes without my eggs? I mean why would you bring just a side of potatoes when I have nothing on the table? Makes no sense. Anyways, for the most part customer service was not bad. The cashier was very nice and waiter was nice too. It seems they might need to hire more staff because the place does get pretty busy. I would give this place another shot.<//text>

Not living up to the hype - was good, it was a good breakfast but not worth the long line down the street wait. This might be one of those when you see others waiting, it must be good! It was ok, nothing to rave home about... and I love a good breakfast/brunch trust me!< /review>

<Review>Can't believe I've never done a review for Tiago Coffee Bar + Kitchen!! I've been coming here since I was a kid.
They have an awesome selection of drinks with unique flavors. Their breakfast food is incredible! My favorite is the lox, they give you a ton of salmon and it comes with a huge delicious salad. They offer a wide range of meals, everything I've tried has been really great.
This is a staple in my breakfast outings!
You can also come in and just order a drink and small snack from the coffee bar.< /Review>< date>

<Review>Was invited here to try their chicken sandwich! I must say it doesn't disappoint. The chipotle spread on the sandwich is very good! Very flavorful. I do wish the chicken was a bit spicer.  other than that the bun was just right amount of sweet and other ingredients were on par! Good food made with love and employees are very carful with your take out orders.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1606342391030, 'text': "The chicken sandwich is organic and served on the best bread from Bub & Grandma's bakery!!!"}<//Response>< gmapID>

<review>While the prices may make you second guess any choice, the flavor will carry through and make you feel mostly justified.  The coffee was good, but not great, but the potatoes and breakfast burrito were great.  If you are driving in to come here though, I might advise against that.

<text>The outside seating area is really nice. You see the tall Palm trees against the blue so Cal sky. Very California.
The Darjeeling tea was nice. They hang the tea bag with a stick which was a nice touch.
The chorizo burrito was really good. Try it for breakfast.
It's a bit on the expensive side with a hot tea and a latte running up over 11 bucks but given it's Hollywood, it's normal< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzoN6SKAONLM-fBobZXSA0jryjCx8__NGa50jP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOSYnkX1wMymgtYZixLkGVbSLxk0D-z2VWHBCHa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2bf20f2252b31:0xda8b1c914d8b0895< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Was invited here to try their chicken sandwich! I must say it doesn't disappoint. The chipotle spread on the sandwich is very good! Very flavorful. I do wish the chicken was a bit spicer.  other than that the bun was just right amount of sweet and other ingredients were on par! Good food made with love and employees are very carful with your take out orders.<//Review>

Hidden gem sitting in plain sight. Bland looking exterior disguises the cute interior. Lots of outdoor seating and plenty of power outlets everywhere. Staff are always friendly and remember you. Macchiatos are good. Apple Pay works here, so you can leave your wallet behind and be fine. Great place to get some work done.</Text>

<text>Had the veggie burger with a side of potatoes and cold brew with oat milk (made in house!)

The coffee was fantastic and the milk was delicious. The burger was tasty but crumbled apart very easily.

That's my only complaint. Crumbly patties.

Let's talk about the potatoes for a minute... hands-down the most tasty thing I've had in a while. So crunchy on the outside with the perfect amount of rosemary and salt.

I'll have to get a double order next time.

I was chatting with some staff and they were the friendliest people I met all day.

Special shout out to ya bobsledding boy, Doc. He was so nice, happy, energetic, and just all- around great customer service.

Would recommend to everyone. Loved it.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Consistently impressed by the food here! Highlights include the quiche, the chewy cookies, the guava cream cheese croissant, and the v solid breakfast sandwich. They also have vegan donuts! Good coffee, friendly staff--support (delicious) small businesses</Review>

My friend got the waffle breakfast sandwich - which looked great as well.  Food was served pretty quickly and staff was pleasant.

<review>I really enjoyed eating here with my friend. We walked over for brunch after hiking at Runyon. It was a pretty hot day so I opted for some iced tea to compliment my meal.

This is some of the best coffee in LA. But why in god’s creation can they not figure out how to vent their cooking smoke? You will smell like the sour oil smoke for the literal entire day if you spend more than 5 minutes inside. 2 stars because you can sit outside. But come on Tiago, figure this out.</review>

I like this place very much. Reasonably health conscious food, but thoughtfully put together and always flavorful.
The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that it seems a little pricey to me for a place where you order at the counter and they bring it to your table.
However, it is central Hollywood and that may simply be the name of the game in this part of town these days.
But for a cup of coffee or breakfast or lunch, It is still one of the best options in the neighborhood for real food.< /review>

I write for a music and coffee blog called Crooners In Coffeeshops, in which I interview local musicians at local coffeeshops. My writeup reflects the positive experience that I encountered at Tiago on our interview date.

Classic favorites and Angelino culture collide in the form of Tiago Coffee Bar + Kitchen’s food and drink offerings. Local and organic ingredients are the focus of a plethora of soups, salads, sandwiches and (mostly) all day breakfast recipes. While you’re drooling over their menu to see what you want to order, help yourself to one of their many freshly made, perfect temperature caffeinated beverages. I’m always a fan of their Ganache Mocha, because life is too short not to have a cup full of liquid chocolate!< /text>

This is an awesome little express breakfast and lunch location. There are plenty of healthy options and good dishes at fair prices.

They have a solid coffee selection in addition to fresh squeezed juices.

Tiago outsources their bakes goods from two separate bakeries; I ate a warmed up chocolate croissant and it was delicious.

The steel cut porridge is incredie and you can take everything to go if you're in a rush. Friendly, quick staff.<//text>

Follow the walk of fame to this trendy, artsy breakfast spot. When you enjoy a breakfast just as much as perhaps a dinner at some nice place then Tiago deserves its 5 stars!</Text>

Tiago's does not catch your eye when you pass in front of it..But if you try it,you will be completely satisfied.There were many choices of breakfast dishes,regarding eggs, yogurt and coffee,all of which seemed nice..

<review>Tiago raised their prices! My cold brew went up a dollar today. I used to go every day, but now I am going to need to stop because it adds up to thousands of dollars every year. I love their staff team, and their food is good, but they should have a customer loyalty program.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

With a chill in the air and the light rain falling down, this was not only the perfect way to warm up, but an absolute delicious way to do it too! Very impressed with it's openness in seating for people watching, yet not too noisy to speak across the table and hear that person either!<//review>

Usually I love this place… But to be closed at 3 PM on a Sunday with no notice to any of the regulars is disappointing. I guess you never knows when it lll be open or not. May have to start going somewhere with more reliable hours. Since the ones on google maps (when it’s not a holiday)aren’t accurate</text>

Was treated extremely rudely by staff and told by them they didn't appreciate my "attitude". My "attitude" was that I ordered an 18 ounce americano which the cashier assured me they could make. The barista guy handed me a quad shot of espresso in an 8 ounce cup. He first lied and said that's they only have one size cup. Then the manager came over and started telling me it's just the way they do things and they would not give me a larger cup with more water, I could have a large coffee (for five dollars I'd already paid) or get my money back. Finally when I was not happy with either option she said she could add more water to the espresso in the small cup at least, and as I was taking a second to think about whether I wanted this she declared she was just going to refund me. I asked to just add the water to the little cup then, to which she SNAPPED at me that she'd already offered me that and that she didn't appreciate my attitude. I don't appreciate YOUR attitude! You're extremely rude and that unfortunately seems the default attitude by some of the employees here. Not all of them, some of them are very nice and I do not want to paint all of them in a poor light just because some of the staff has an attitude. It seems the management is not overseeing customer service as can be seen by other reviews with similar complaints.< /Text>

Just finished our breakfast now. We have been traveling around the states for the past month and this has been the best breakfast we have had so far. Everything was nice and fresh, well
Flavored and just simple. Cute little cafe, a little hidden and very reasonably priced. Also, the coffee was great!!!</review>

Neat little spot. Interior design was far cooler than bland exterior. Staff was friendly, but always seemed busy.  Pour over was ok. Breakfast was fantastic. Little pricey, but well worth it for good food.<//Review>

High quality coffee and food. The pour-over coffee is my favorite, it's smooth and strong. Ricotta cheese pancakes are really great. I get them for lunch all the time.<//Review>

Tiago Cafe has my favorite coffee and the food is delicious! I love that they use quality ingredients, utilizing local organic when possible. The staff is great and the kitchen runs efficiently. Great atmosphere as well:)< /Text>

<Text>Neat little spot. Interior design was far cooler than bland exterior. Staff was friendly, but always seemed busy.  Pour over was ok. Breakfast was fantastic. Little pricey, but well worth it for good food.</Text>< user_name>

This place was pretty good, it had a nice atmosphere and good service. I didn't like the oats because they were made on not very good soy milk, but we also had the breakfast burrito and the granola, and they were both delicious. The chai latte was terrible, don't get it!< /text>

I work a block from this place so I go for lunch regularly. I like that they have vegan friendly items and their food is great. However, the service....I'd never really had a bad experience here until last time I made a phone order for only a side of potatoes and was told it would take 5 minutes to be ready ( the time it takes me to walk over), I arrive at the till, pay and wait and wait and wait. I heard the cashier ask for my potatoes but no one moved to get them or looked for them, I watched as the workers were telling jokes, pushing each other and laughing. I finally asked one of the very entertained workers if my potatoes were done and he looked at me quite sternly, like I had asked something crazy while he was on break, which he wasn't. He walked over to the cook's window and asked for my potatoes - waited there and kept laughing, did't even bother to inform me that no one had placed the order. 25 minutes for one side of potatoes. No apology, no acknowledgement of their several mistakes.</text>

Features ample outdoor seating and great view of the walk of fame strollers. Very WiFi friendly. Only thing missing? A wait staff.<//Text>< username>

Really great coffee and good breakfasts.  Try the pancake stack.  Also just far enough from the strip to be quiet - perhaps not exactly local though.<//Text>

<Text>I've eaten here a million times and it's consistently solid, never amazing. The food is tasty, especially the breakfast burrito. It ain't cheap, but if you want something easy and risk-free, tiago is a safe bet.</Text>< pictures>

<review>Coffee sucked no other explanation.

Food was so bland and lacked basic ingredients such as salt and pepper. I was checking to see if I lost all my taste buds because usually this restaurant is decent.

I ordered the breakfast sandwich + a vanilla almond iced latte. Total came to 14$ and some change - which again is a rip off.

* Side included some rusty thot potatoes *</review>< Rating>

It’s a solid place to get coffee, a spot of food and great sitting outside to do some conferencing or work. to think / I’d be a member of WeWork across the road but they don’t let yuppie me have a membership that will let me attend multiple office locations w a hot desk. Well ok I shall continue patronizing excellent coffee shops like this one. Like I said, solid and reliable.</text>

<text>Great atmosphere and very attractive customers aside from the least attractive homeless asking for money outside. Great food and coffee. Free Cucumber water.

All I can say is- I love Tiago. I walk there multiple times a week with my dog or with friends to grab a great coffee and amazing food. The staff are incredible and will remember you by name and the location is awesome!
My go to's are the: breakfast sandwich, beef brisket, prosciutto de Parma and the breakfast burrito. Everything is fresh, tasty and generally awesome!

Having moved from Australia recently, I'm always on the look out for a good flat white. I had some friends in town yesterday and we stumbled upon Tiago just per chance as we were in the area.

I got the flat white, and I have to say its the best flat white I have had since being here in the USA. The young female barista knew exactly what she was doing, and it was re-assuring that she didn't ask if I meant "The drink they sell at Starbucks". It came in a 5.5 oz cup, consistency of the milk was dead on what I would expect (its not a no foam latte!). The roast tasted a little darker than some of the more independent coffee places i've been to, which I actually prefer. I'll definitely be making my way back there again!</Text>

Expensive, excellent coffee. If you want great tasting coffee shake this place down, if you just kinda need caffeine maybe go somewhere else.</text>

Best coffee that I have had in USA.... without a doubt.  It even comes in the right size cup, at the right temperature and at a good price.< /Review>

Good coffee, staff were friendly enough. I asked (being a tourist brit) if there was any change for two Americanos (2 x 2.75) not knowing how much tax etc. She said there was a penny change from 6 dollars which I didn't receive. Not that I care about not receiving my penny back, but principle and all that. I asked if that was because of tax and she said, "I guess so". Meh, whatever. Coffee was good and the food looks tasty. Decor is nice too.</review>

Nice atmosphere and good great outdoor seating, but the espresso is no good. It's bitter and over extracted. You'd get a similar shot at Starbucks. This is not not craft coffee.</Text>

Coffee is always good. But over priced. I ordered a latte and donut and it was over $8. Also the staff always seems like they are being bothered. Maybe the hipster attitude is just lost on me.</Review>
