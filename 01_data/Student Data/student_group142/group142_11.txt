Great experience, I called they told me a little over an hour to do an oil change and tire rotation. I needed it done quickly before I left out of town for a real estate conference. They fulfilled their promise and it was cheap too. I might start going here instead of Toyota. I They even have WIFI. I was able to write my real estate contract while I waited. Loved it!! Great customer service. I love the mom and pops atmosphere. #holdenhomesrealty #lynellholden #justsellwithlynell #travel #realestate #sales #homesforsale #housingexpert</text>

I accidentally overfilled my oil in a Saturday while on a roadtrip :/ . I was near this place and  asked them to drain and refill (on my newer Audi). I called and was told to come by.

When I arrived someone begrudgingly looked at it and then he claimed he heard a bad noise (Audis make the noise he was referring to, longtime owner and discussed this with my German car mechanic as well).  He absolutely refused to do an oil change claiming I could sue him or something. I reassured him I wouldn’t hold him accountable for anything, I just wanted to pay him for an oil change. He still refused and basically left me in a bind. Most places were at closing time and I wasted my time getting denied service there.

Another mechanic came over to me and was super nice and empathetic, and said No biggie, we can totally do that. He tried to get the oil change done for me and was stopped by the other guy.

The stars I did leave are for Tom, because he actually acted like he cared and wanted to help me. Thank goodness I won’t ever need to return here.</Text>

<Review>Very satisfied came in for a tire balance on one tire due to vibration, since i had over sized tires they could not guarantee it would solve my vibration issue but none the less the fact that they attempted and did balance my tire when i had taken it to previous tire shops and was rejected had me satisfied. I would definitely recommend going here for service.<//Review>< Time>

<Text>I had an oil change done a few months ago and after putting the oil in they put the cover back on and the person didn't realize a black wire was caught while he screwed back on the cover which ended up cutting the wire so when I returned back and told Tom who was working at the front desk at the time and explained to him what had happened all he said was "thank you for letting me know"! And I was speechless.. Never again will I let them do work on my car!</Text><date>1578531227349</date></record>

Blew a tire. Convenience forced me to this business. Nice people, service was good, prices were 20 bucks more per tire than competition.  Two new tires had cosmetic white wall defect, not a major deal.  If you don't want to wait at major shops and have money,... this is fine, however if you want to save money, maybe have better brand selection; ....don't. Cheers</review>

<text>They installed 8 ply tires on my truck with a camper. It was suppose to be 10 ply. When I went back they said by Goodrich dosent make a 10 ply. That's a not true. I found that 5 other tire stores can get them. They wouldn't do anything about it. It's not safe with 8 ply on a truck with a camper. I also paid them to put overload leaf springs on my f-250 and it was so undersized that my truck sagged in the back end really bad. I had to go to a guy in dixon who built me a 5 leaf overload setup for it and it worked perfect. These guys don't know what there doing when it comes to heavy duty trucks. I will never go back there again.<//text><Date>1553723389793</Date><rating>1< /rating>< gmapID>

JR and his team went above and beyond! I will definitely recommend this shop to others and will return in the future (but let's hope not too soon). All the members of the shop were extremely courteous and polite. I am very satisfied with the service I received here today. I'd give 10 star if I could

<Text>Just wanted to take a minute to say what outstanding customer service we received at this location. Nick Beck went above and beyond. We would give 10 stars if we could. A must visit location if you need tires. Once again a BIG THANKS for excellent service.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Great!  Pleasant, friendly people.  They did an excellent job on my brakes for a few dollars more than Meineke had quoted me.  However, that price also included two front tires which had separated.  I wonder how much more I would have paid  at Meineke!<//Review>< pics>

I got 6 tires for my rv rear breaks and alignment done cost was $1400 which was not bad not great either but then they tried to charge me $650 for shocks when it is only 2 bolts per shock the shocks cost me about 200 so would have been 450 to take 8 bolts out and put shocks in when you already had all the rims and tires off so i felt kinda like they was trying to get a little to much in the end
I did them in about 10 minutes per shock and thats taking my time
You guys are a rip off when comes to anything other than tires and even then you are over priced most of the time
And the idiot didnt even put my rims back on in right order 4 out of 6 rims are black and you put the 2 white ones on on side and two black on one side of the rear no attention to detail simple fix for me just bust out the rattle can and paint the rims lol but dam its not that hard is it<//Text>

<Text>Why I just call fairfield tire center and I was getting a price quote. I have a 2014 nissan maxima. Whoever answer the phone, gave me a price quote of $1100. I told him I trying to stay in the $450-$500 range for some tires. His second quote was $750.00. Why in the hell would you quote somebody on another tire for $750.00 when I JUST TOLD YOU I WAS LOOKING FOR TIRES IN THE $450-500 RANGE. Poor customer service. Stay away, these fools are crooks.</Text>< userid>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Please shop around before you give this place your hard earned money. If you want tires and don't care what you pay this is the place for you.

My wife took her car here without telling me first and paid top dollar for inferior tires. I could have purchased name brand tires for what she paid. There fees for balance and disposal and weights/ stems is really high as well. Here is an example.

Americas tire would have sold and installed Hankook tires for almost $50 less out the door. most of that is difference in install fees. Here is an example:
Americas tire- 215/60-16 Hankook Optimo H727 are $86.00 each, total out the door comes to $478.78

From fairfield tire my wife was charged $89 each for Uniroyal tiger paw touring tires, out the door paid $529.20... Im sorry but thats a huge difference and for a inferior tire. The Hankook is rated a 9.0 and hardly anyone else even carry this Uniroyal brand..

BUT Sears does, they charge $69.00 a tire.

Walmart also, they charge $78.75 a tire

There are a few others that come up when searched, all lower than what we paid. Its a shame to know that you trust a place in your home town to take care of you but instead they pray on the unsuspecting. Do your research and save your money, if we were talking a few bucks I would understand, but everything I look at points to this place is just much more than everywhere else.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Staff here can be heard griping with each other. Tempers started to flare while I was waiting for a tire to be swapped from one rim to another. Prices were fairly reasonable. The waiting area is rather boring and not very clean. Store interior is cluttered and bland.<//Review>

Like Subway but better & healthier! Build your own salad or wraps. Love their smoothies! Be aware they're only open until like 3pm right now because of Covid<//Text>

The food was fresh and prepared well. Most of their food items price is based on weight, so don't put too much!!! It adds up. They even charge for the dressing, which is added at the end. RIDICULOUS!! It's a good place but I won't be going back.<//review>

The detox #1 is delicious and healthy. Beets, carrots, apple, spinach, and celery. The South of the Border wrap is completely customizable. If you like spicy, ask for the cilantro chipotle sauce.

The decor is simple and trendy. Parking is easy. I recommend getting there before noon to beat the lunch rush.<//text><gmapID>0x80dd2b53c46415a1:0x549d8622b0384154< /gmapID>< response>

Skip the fast food and do yourself a favor and eat healthy. Yes it'll cost a bit more than Burger King but the food here won't kill you. 🤣 Give their fresh made juices a try, your body will love you for it.< /review>

<time>1600723742342< /time><Rate>2<//Rate><Text>I would have posted a 1 star but the smoothie I ordered was actually tasty even though it wasn't thoroughly blended. The staff was extremely unorganized and not the most professional. I had placed a to go order and they said 30-40min wait. For a salad?? Then when I got there and let them know my to go order name they started my order while I was there and then mid order they started taking other people who walked in and serving them. At least 3 people got their food before mine (when I had ordered before) and I sat there while my food was just there waiting for me. Not only that but they couldn't get my order right and I had to remind them multiple times what my order contained. Then when I finally sat down at home to enjoy my salad there was too much dressing and you could tell either that they didn't wash the greens thoroughly or used spoiled greens. Almost every bite tasted like dirt. Wasnt too happy with this experience and wouldn't go back and would not recommend to my friends or family.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Really good spot! Definitely the kind of deliciously healthy food that everyone could use a little more of. Highly recommend the wraps and smoothies - and even one smoothie will be a more than sufficient lunch.</text>

<review>I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  Everyone that knows me knows this is my favorite spot in La Mirada!! I go here after the gym especially!! I always get the South of the Border wrap!! I'm not going to tell you the sauce though because sometimes they run out. And I'm looking for the green juice that is bomb!! So far I've tried 2, but they are the wrong ones. So if you know of one let me know please.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Love this place. Fresh healthy ingredients.  Came with my 15 year old boy kicking and screaming. He changed his tune after he had the California Wrap. Service was great as well.</text>

<Text>First, the food is good, fresh, and have many veggie options. However, the kids that they have working are SO RUDE! They fight with customers, say things behind their back and make people feel completely uncomfortable. Also, they always make sandwiches different each time. So you have to go when hopefully when they are in a good mood.<//Text>< Pictures>

Drive 20 mins here to be told they were out of juices on a Sunday at noon. How are you a juice bar with no juices. Also they only have three options of greens to use. No kale If that is what you are looking for. Also this resteraunt is a knock off of a east coast franchise called CHOPT< /Text>

<text>I gave 5 stars because I just went in today for lunch and ordered the pesto wrap without chicken and cheese. The girl who helped me was in tune and intelligent enough to ask if I was vegan. I didn't have to tell her!

She let me know that their pesto has dairy in it and suggested hummus. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that. The veggies in my wrap were fresh and the hummus was delicious.

My granddaughter got the peanut butter acai bowl with her choice of toppings. She gave it a thumbs up. I like that there are options for vegans here. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. I will be back here for sure since I always lament how La Mirada is lacking in vegan places.</text></record>

Decent food, good smoothie. Wish the pastrami was sliced thinner too thick to be able to successfully bite through it so you end up pulling the meat out of the sandwich because you failed to bite it completely off.<//Text>

I love this place! Pricy salads (by pound), but totally worth it! I like customizing my salads and not having to do all the veggie preparation at home. Friendly service too.<//Review>

< review>
We got the South of the Border salad. It was delicious. The concept of paying by weight is a little strange considering the salad ingredients were predetermined. I guess you could add more toppings which would increase the weight/price but it really doesn't make sense when you don't have control over  how much is going in it.<//review>

A tad pricey for building your own fruit salad or juice but overall healthy = expensive . Great concept for healthier choices and flavors are also amazing. Worth every penny</text>

<Text>Really? So I stop by here and decide on the California chicken salad. Im dieting and chose
The salad specifically for the avocado. The lady starts making my salad. Afters a few ingredients she says "sorry, we ran out of avocado."  Really? Having my heart set in that salad specifically for the avocado, i passed. A pet peeve is a business that runs out of supplies. So unprofessional.  Frustrating.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Nothing fresher than a selection from Chopp'd. With out a doubt this is my favorite on the go place to eat, the wraps, salads, smoothies and juices are filled with love. Even down to the protein powder being whey isolate, they focus on food to heal the soul. You can make it all your own. As a former resident of Maui, this is the only place that I have found with fresh healthy Choice and people filled with Aloha! Love love love Chopp'd. Try it and I'm sure you will love it too!<//Review>

Great customizable options for salads, wraps and Acaí bowls. Lots of options and you pay by the pound. The Acaí bowl is a little sweeter than other places.  Nice comfy seating.<//Text>

I had a Tuna Pannini combo (chips, & a fountain drink) for an additional $1.99. It was simple but delicious. My wife had a Walnut Apple Salad. She use to work at Sweet Green their Santa Monica location. I prefer Sweet Green. She's Uber pleased that The Feta cheese is pasteurized because she's pregnant. She'd give Sweetgreen six stars out of five. I'll try this place again. She of course wants to go here on a regular basis<//text>

This winery was a wonderful experience and all of the wine was just top notch! The staff was very informative, helpful, and kind. The sampling room was so well put together with such a comfortable feel it made it quite difficult to leave to continue on to other wineries! The cave was a great addition to the tour. I’d definitely recommend this as a stop on your next Napa Valley getaway!< /review>

The service here was incredible! Their reds are some of the best in the area but the other main reason for my review is Tom, our server. He was fantastic, so knowledge, fun, accommodating. Hands down one of our best experiences in wine country!< /Review>

Bianca rocked our wine tasting world, with a great tour, informative tasting, wonderful recommendations, and great lounge experience.  Odette estate was worth more than the tour we paid for.  Go off-peak, enjoy the beautiful estate and spectacular wines. Loved it, worth every cent.  Did I mention Bianca is awesome?<//Review>

The least hospitable winery yet the most expensive tasting of the 4 wineries we went to for the day. We started with 3 true small family wineries, which were incredible, only to end the day with a flop at Odette. The girl who hosted us couldn't have been less hospitable and clearly thought she was the greatest. Having an attitude and talking down to guests you're hosting doesn't help you sell wine, it helps you get bad reviews.

There are too many other wineries in the valley to waste your time or money here. This winery (along with Cade and Plumpjack) is owned by California governor, Gavin Newsom, so you're supporting him<//text>

<Review>Booked a tasting here with my family. The tasting started out well. We had an excellent and knowledgeable employee guiding us through the tasting. We had made sure it was a family friendly winery since we had two babies with us, but as soon as my daughter started fussing we were approached by a female employee who told us to go outside. She did not give me a chance to console the baby and I did not get to finish my tasting. The situation made me feel completely unwelcome. I wouldn't recommend going with children.</Review>< pics>

The property is beautiful and the wine lovely, but the experience itself is very underwhelming. We were given the WEAKEST WINE POURS, received no water refills, and had to ask if there was anything else we could try after our tasting instead of being offered. This was very disappointing for a $75pp estate tasting, where we planned to stock up on more Odette and instead left empty-handed. Cade is a better property with better staff, views, and wine. Go there instead!< /review>

What a joke! We booked a tasting at Odette but didn’t taste any odette wine! How misleading!! And our tasting guide was a child and so not reputable. Bottom line-don’t waste your time! I was so tempted to refuse to pay because of the fact that we booked odette yet didn’t drink any of their wine.<//Review>

One of our favorite wineries in Napa. Big CADE, baby cade, and Odette are all bold and flavorful. Adaptation is awesome for its value!</text>

<review>First the positives: this is a beautiful, modern property with views of Stag's Leap. The cabs from Cade and Odette are very good. The downsides: this is a completely corporate experience. We visited with fiends who are long time members of Cade. They would have a comped tasting but it was clear from the many signs that no other tasting would be comped. This is a big departure from most higher end wineries that want members to bring guests. Our guide came over and proceeded to talk extremely quickly through all 5 wines before departing to sit down with other guests. This is again a major departure from other "private" tastings. Finally we asked to compare the wines poured to others in their menu and we're told this wasn't possible. Overall, the experience was our worst in Napa and Sonoma in the past 5 years (multiple visits) just because of the retail atmosphere. We won't visit Cade, Odette, or Plumpjack again. Too many other options with great  wines AND hospitality.<//review><user_name>Doug Samuel</user_name>< user>

Don’t waste your time visiting this winery. They’re understaffed and try to cram as many “scheduled” appointments in as possible simultaneously,  resulting in a rushed, underwhelming experience. April (the woman trying to do all the work) probably needed 3 or 4 more staffers that day to handle the bus loads of people getting dropped off at the same time. We came all the way from Chicago to see your winery because we heard it was nice, but it resulted in the worst experience we had all weekend in Napa. There are no second chances for first impressions, and despite only ordering a few bottles that day, I decided to cancel my wine order because wine purchases after tours should be about good memories, wonderful conversations, and smiles....this was a miserable fail of epic proportions and I hope others take notice if they have any desire to visit this poorly run business. There are far better ways to spend 90 minutes in Napa than visiting Odette. Pass.</Review>

This winery was by far my absolute favorite winery! My husband and I had a private tour and tasting with Casey. Outstanding! He was knowledgeable and as an 8th generation Californian, he is an expert on wine! We learned so much about the process and enjoyed handpicking and tasting the different grapes straight from the vine. We visited wineries such as Silver Oak and Opus One and let me tell you, Odettte wines surpass any wine we tasted. ( we went to a dozen wineries over a few days: hands down, Odettte is my new Fav!</review>

Has a very cool Frisbee Disk course but all the holes in the ground from the local critters makes for a sprain ankle or even a broken one.

<user>109515646814208145922< /user><Review>The 2 parks are relatively new, about 2 years. There's a playground for 4 years and under and one for 5 and up. It's clean and great for kids. The restrooms that are under the city of Beaumont have never been open during the 2 years. What's a waste of tax money. So often I see families walking to the bathroom only to be disappointed that they're close.< /Review><response>None</response><pics>None< /pics>< GmapID>

Nice and grassy areas for both little dogs and big dogs. Wish there was more shade and more seating. But it's nice nonetheless.</review>

<Review>I love this park! Most rimes we fo we're the only ones there. The grounds are clean, nicely landscaped and well-kempt. Park is right across the road from railroad tracks and trains do pass by every few minutes so prepare to hear their noise. We've seen folks flying their drones from the parking lot and there are tennis, handball and basketball courts and an 18-hole disc (Frisbee) golf course... something for just about everyone. There's a paw park for your dogs to enjoy and a walking trail of sorts. Allergy sufferers BEWARE and take your Zyrtec, Claritin, Allegra or whatever: there are dandelions and there's so many of them it looks and feels like a pollen alien attack. Picnic tables and little cast iron bbq grills spread about but we haven't used them yet. Best time to enjoy during the summer months is early in the morning or in the evening because it gets HOT right around 11 am and unless you're one of those strange souls who enjoys playing in heat that feels like a crematorium you'll want to govern yourself accordingly. Signs are posted warning of snakes, coyotes and mountain lions but so far we've only seen one coyote... from a distance... on the walking trail... following a lady who was walking her little dog. 😲<//Review>< pics>

It's a nice dog park however, the water is outside the fence and there are no human restrooms.<//Text>

<Text>1st time customer ordering a set of Fox 2.0 coilovers for my 2019 Tacoma. Very happy with the speedy shipping Shock Surplus provided, keep in mind since these are bigger items, the front coils shipped separately from the rear shocks but they both still arrived on time and early! So please don't worry if half of your order is missing, it's on its way! Thank you Shock Surplus, you've earned a new lifetime customer.</Text></record>

I was interested in one of their products which was out of stock at the time, so I registered myself on their notification list. A few weeks later I got an email that the product was available, so I promptly placed an order. Unfortunately, a couple of days later I received an email from them that part of the product was not available, and asking me how I wanted to proceed. I told them I didn't mind waiting, and a couple of days later the rest of the product was available and shipped to me.

In summary -- had some hiccups with the availability of the product, but their proactive communication was appreciated.</Text>

<Review>Great Customer Service! Placed an order on a Sunday and my Bilstein 6112's showed up that Thursday. Had a few questions and got an email response in bout 24hrs explaining everything.

Highly recommend Shock Surplus!<//Review><date>1622935704617<//date></record>

<Review>So far not good at all. I only received partial items and when I called asking where my remaining items were. They said it would be on the way and that I’ll receive a tracking number in 24hrs well a day has past and no tracking number. I call back next day and they said their was no note stating anything so they would put it in the system and ship it out right away. Guess what it’s been 4 days and still no tracking number. So I called back and was told by a gentleman named Jeff that it has not been shipped yet. He will contact the warehouse and I should get a tracking number that night. Still nothing. Did I get scammed for a shock and reservoir?</Review><Date>1623161059991</Date><response>{'time': 1623168138690, 'text': 'Good morning Jairo.

Always a great experience with this company. Nick at the CS team has always been super helpful with figuring out best options for all budget ranges. Definitely a repeat customer (for different cars), and will continue to do so with this company! Thanks guys!</text>

Made a order recommended by this company. When contacted with the recommendation they stated it had just been in stock and that I can make the purchase. After the order was made they never gave me a tracking number. I contacted them via email requesting a tracking number and never got a response. Couple of days after i sent them a message through their website requesting the number and never got a response. Days after i spoke with someone on the phone requesting a tracking number and he could not give me a answer. He said he'll contact me the following day with a answer. Following day i got a message on their website saying they are actually out of stock. Spoke with Jeff on the phone who stated was the manager. Ultimately shocks were not in stock. I had a special trip planned, installation appointment made two weeks in advance so my truck can be ready and now its been ruined. Just a fyi. Thank you.<//text>

When I finally decided on the setup I wanted for my Truck, it was sold out everywhere. I used the Shock Surplus website and requested notifications and I was notified as soon as it was in. Once I ordered the setup, it arrived within the week! Thanks!</review>

< Review>
I worked with Sean on selecting the correct rear shocks for my 04 Tacoma 4x4.  Having Bilstein 6112 up front, I wanted to match it up to the 5100 series, however the rear is stock height.  Sean dove in and verified the lengths for each shock (4600, 5100, 5160) and gave me several options to run the 5100 if I really wanted to, with the 4600 being recommended as the shock to get for stock height application.  The 5160 series matches closely to the 4600 in terms of collapse, extension, travel, and was the 2nd option if I choose to drop the cash on it.  This was a tricky one since not many folks run these shocks on 1st gen Tacoma trucks, but Sean helped and replied quickly.  Much appreciated for all the info!  I'll be waiting patiently until the 5160's are back in stock to get them!< /Review>

<review>Ordered a full suspension kit after a lengthy discussion with Nick about my project. Received lots of incorrect info about what I bought, and it ended up not getting me the result I had discussed with him. They drop shipped my order, and whoever they ordered it from forgot to send part of the order. This caused long delays during the installation. They haven’t done anything to try to rectify the situation. I would recommend looking elsewhere for product recommendations. They have good pricing, but so do other shops.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<review>I ordered a set of shocks from them - they don't make shocks so this review is about customer service rather than the product. The order was shipped in two packages - front and rear. The rear set was sent via Fedex, and arrived promptly. The other one - via usps which still is under control of dejoy criminal. The package stuck in Denver with no updates, movement, or ETA for over a week. I called customer service and they shipped the replacement overnight.
Other than bad decision to use dejoy's outfit, they behaved in the best possible manner.
Granted, the phone number is not listed on their site but I found it online, emails are not paid attention to.<//review><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
I would like allow any individual that is thinking of purchasing a set of shocks or any other product, to stop and go elsewhere. I was told by Shawn at shock surplus that the set of rancho shocks that I purchased caries a lifetime warranty. Shock surplus replaced the front shocks  not once but  twice. Now allegedly the other Shawn the owner told me had received a bad batch of shocks. If this same problem happened again to call back and we would have to go with something else. So guess what. It happened again. Now upon calling them. Shawn #1 not the owner supposedly told me to go through rancho. So I called Rancho.. They told me these shocks could only be replaced once. The warranty was shock surplus responsibility . So then I called shock surplus back. Once again got Shawn #1. Who in both calls was rude and kept interrupting me while talking. I then asked for the owner Shawn. Since I dealt with him previously. Then I was told no I couldn’t speak with him. Then the real kicker . Shawn 1 told me he would be glad to send me new replacement shocks for a core cost of something along 179.00. Now to me that’s not very good business. Especially after they never charged me a penny the first 2 times relplacing  these shocks for the seals going out, and leaking the fluid over everything. So the moral of this is do not I repeat do not do business with. Shock surplus.  Take your money elsewhere.< /Review>

Hi, I bought the ICON stage 4 for my 20 Tacoma from Nick at Shock Surplus and I saved a lot! The suspension kit had all the needed items bundled and then they were $500 less than my local installer. Nick was helpful in answering my questions and the suspension on the truck looks awesome. It is frigid and snowy here in Colorado so I havent really put it through its paces yet, but so far in some light offroading and street use it is solid. Check out the pic after install of this suspension paired with the new Icon Vector 6 wheels and Wrangler ultraterrain AT.< /Text>

Pretty upset how this has gone, costumer service these days is awful. I purchased the 5100s, the shipping said it would take 3 to 5 business days to receive them, also said I would receive a tracking #.  7 business days in and haven't recieved anything so I called shock surplus to ask what was going on, they told me they didn't even have the front shocks in stock and they didn't want to send the rear because they didn't know if I wanted to cancel my order. When I bought the shocks online, their site showed they were in stock so this was new to me. Since I've already paid I told the guy I still wanted the shocks, so they sent the rear which came in last week. 3 weeks later and I have no idea when the front shocks will be here, and once again will probably have to call them to find out what's going on. Customer service is horrible.< /review>

Prompt shipping on the order. It came much faster than I anticipated. The problem came when I opened the box and found I was missing 1 shock (bought a set of 4) and the hardware for another. I emailed them and received a response within 1 day. I emailed back the requested info (photo of the packing slip showing only 3 shipped and the part # to the missing shock and hardware). It has now been 6 days since sending and no response to my emails or chat attempts. I am hoping to hear something soon or will be forced to dispute the charge on my credit car
**
Response finally received and all parts received. If the order would have been fulfilled correctly the first time or a prompt response to the delivery issue would have been 5*.</Text>

A really crew team to work with. They are very knowledgeable in all areas of suspension.

Horrible customer service! Never pick up their phone and barely reply on emails. I am trying to do a return and they only sent me 1 label when there was supposed to be 2 labels because I have 2 big boxes to send back to them. I tried everything to reach back to them to send me another label but nothing is working. They are not replying whatsoever. So now I am stuck with this item and don’t know what to do when my other half order already sent back to them. This is a total BS and I wouldn’t recommend anyone dealing with this company. You will be disappointed! Horrible horrible horrible! Very upset with them !!!<//Text>

Received wrong shocks. Called but can’t talk to customer service unless you want to place order. Requested return on 08/27/20 online. Got an instant email stating that someone would be in touch within one business day. After 5 days went by I emailed them again asking  to return for full refund, On 9/1/20, I got the following response “ I apologize for the delay.  Our warehouse just gave us the RGA for the 24-186636 We are still waiting on the RGA for the other part number. Please see the attached for the return label for only the 24-186636” It has now been 20 days and still haven’t received RGA for other part number.<//Text>

Product selection on Shock Surplus was great.  Had every option that I wanted to review and ultimately was able to pick the suspension I needed.  The bad, however, was how I received the product - there was no packing material within the box to keep my pricey new suspension safe for transport, and the box itself was falling apart on arrival.  Inside the box, the individual suspension boxes were also damaged from transport.  But, it does not appear that the suspension tubes, or components themselves were damaged. I have not had the time to install the suspension at the moment, but do hope that there is no damage that could have been induced from the shipping.< /Text>

<name>Carl Olsen< /name><Rating>4</Rating><review>I was left a bit frustrated with the difficulty of communication after purchasing and having an issue with Rancho Quick Lift strut assemblies. After a few days of back and forth Shock Surplus has stepped up to resolve the issue. I wish they would have stepped up a bit quicker, but glad they did and understand their initial hesitation.
....
I learned that the underlying issue was due to Rancho changing the the spring without changing the part number. Shock Surplus had no control over this. The issue was also perpetrated by Rancho and misinformation from their reps who insisted that a spring with more coils (the old part had 6.5 active coils) has the same spring rate as the new spring (which has 5.5 active coils). Anyone who has modified springs before, and definitely anyone who manufactures them, should know that more coils lowers spring rate Les coils increases it. I am including photos of the two different parts as well as a photo of the formula for calculating spring rate (maybe some reps at Rancho will read and learn math).
Edit: my photo of the spring rate formula didn't post so here it is written (torsional mudulous for Steel=11,250,000)
SPRING RATE =
11,250,000(Wire Dia.)(Wire Dia.)(Wire Dia.)(Wire Dia.) / 8(Active Coils)(Mean Coil Dia)(Mean Coil Dia)(Mean Coil Dia)</review>< GmapID>

Customer service needs improvement.

I ordered my shocks and struts and had no issues with delivery, The issue that I encounter was that the rear shocks did not fit my vehicle. I was warned that they might not, I requested a refund for those rear shocks and kept the front ones. It took them almost 3 weeks to refund my partial refund after several emails (no one replied) and calls (no one answers) until they finally send an email saying my refund was reimburse.< /text>

Overall a decent experience. I ordered some shocks and struts using your website and confirmed they would fit my vehicle, upon arrival I immediately noticed that they were incorrect. I contacted the support team to let them know and that I wanted to return them. At first I was told I would be receiving a shipping return label, but then I was told that I need to ship them back to the address they gave me and that I would be refunded. I paid $77 to have them shipped back and was refunded quickly for the original purchase amount, but then was told I wasn’t going to be refunded for my return shipping because it wasnt apart of the original order. I would’ve been better off selling them privately for less than I paid, instead of wasting money and paying out of pocket to return them.

Updated it to a one star due to them ignoring my emails now.< /review>

I was left a bit frustrated with the difficulty of communication after purchasing and having an issue with Rancho Quick Lift strut assemblies. After a few days of back and forth Shock Surplus has stepped up to resolve the issue. I wish they would have stepped up a bit quicker, but glad they did and understand their initial hesitation.
....
I learned that the underlying issue was due to Rancho changing the the spring without changing the part number. Shock Surplus had no control over this. The issue was also perpetrated by Rancho and misinformation from their reps who insisted that a spring with more coils (the old part had 6.5 active coils) has the same spring rate as the new spring (which has 5.5 active coils). Anyone who has modified springs before, and definitely anyone who manufactures them, should know that more coils lowers spring rate Les coils increases it. I am including photos of the two different parts as well as a photo of the formula for calculating spring rate (maybe some reps at Rancho will read and learn math).
Edit: my photo of the spring rate formula didn't post so here it is written (torsional mudulous for Steel=11,250,000)
SPRING RATE =
11,250,000(Wire Dia.)(Wire Dia.)(Wire Dia.)(Wire Dia.) / 8(Active Coils)(Mean Coil Dia)(Mean Coil Dia)(Mean Coil Dia)</Review>

Found a well priced set of shocks for my lifted jk, however the kit utilized a longer shock than what the height called for. With a phone call, Shock Surplus had no problem finding a set that has the right fit and travel length and exchanged the sets at no extra cost. Way to go!<//Review>

Received my two packages with eight total shocks/stabilizers fairly quick. When package was received box 1 of 2 was damaged on one end. No parts were damaged despite the poor packing to support shocks in box. I spoke with a member of shock surplus and they informed me that the stabilizers I need for my 2003 Ford F-250 4x4 with a 6” lift was one particular item by bilstein. So I ordered the almost $700 order with understanding of hassle free returns and exchanges. I ordered parts when I was out of town; therefore, I thought I would take the employee for their “knowledge.” Upon receiving, stabilizers were wrong fit. I called to inform so I could get parts exchanged. After two days of them taking to their exchange department my exchange was approved...at my expense. Despite their company assisting me on my order I still am told that I have to pay for my own shipping to exchange. Jeff and Sean the associates I was talking with through this were very rude and at one point told me via email that “This can either mean A) you made the incorrect assumption your dual stabilizer set up took 2 oem style stabilizers or B) you have a two 2WD trucks and you ordered two 4wd stabilizers.” Pictures to show all this poor service will be attached. In turn watch what you order because this company won’t and they will make the entire purchasing process a nightmare. Highly unsatisfied with poor service!

And then for Sean to call me and tell me he would be glad for me to take my business elsewhere. What a tool. Don’t hire people that can’t serve your business and tell me it’s my fault because I wasn’t there looking at my truck when the parts were ordered to verify that what your employee told me was correct!<//Text>

Great prices but bad fulfillment ie rep on phone couldn't state closest warehouse would fulfill order vs one over 1,000 miles away, even though the closest one had the items, then 7 days to deliver vs 3-5 stated in writing, plus nothing but excuses, so buyer beware< /review>

<review>Ordered shocks for my Bronco. Shocks shipped and arrived soon then expected.  I had mis ordered the rear shocks, emailed customer services and the response time was immediate.  Within a hour I had a shipping label for the return and the replacements were on the way.  Couldn't be more satisfied with the whole experience.</review>< Pics>

< review>
This is the best Dr. Juan Montez that I’ve ever had in my entire life totally being honest He’s very patient he’s very professional listens to his patient spends a decent amount of time with his patients  never rushes always answers all questions and cares about his patience and always returns calls when requested another employee that goes way beyond the call of duty Gabriella G always makes the me  feel special and is very thorough and professional and sets the scales very high for Dr. J Montez medical Center if you’re looking for a doctors office that cares and the people are nice and care about their patients this is definitely the place to go and they didn’t pay me to say this lol I know it’s hard to hear so many good things in such a place but it’s totally true give them a shot and you’ll never regret it eventually you will have your whole family going there this is my way of giving back to dr. Juan Montez office by sharing a family oriented professional medical office it’s like a diamond in the rough then a patient going on six years last visit was June 18, 2021 When you go ask for Ask for Gabriella and tell them you want to book an appointment to see Dr. Juan Montez and tell them Mr. Pierce sent you😉<//review>

Visited them April 2021 and was pleased it wasnt crowded and social distancing was strongly used. THAT was very pleasant and i hope they keep it up AFTER covid. The girls at the desk are SO nice and friendly..and the Physicians Assistant was very helpful and listened.< /review>

<text>I usually get to my appointments 15 minutes early but because it was Friday and after 2 pm traffic was crazy and I was a few minutes late. I checked in with a polite and business like receptionist and waited about 10 minutes to be called in for my appointment. Saw Dr. Tran, went over my health issues, he answered my questions explained everything. All in all it was a good appointment, all personnel here are always very polite and helpful.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c2d3d8ea3454cf:0xccd3d09ff2876828<//Gmap_id>< Pics>

I've been here twice so far, and each time I'm satisfied with my visit. The physician takes her time, answers all questions and concerns and I don't feel rushed. They also just introduced an online portal for their patients which is a big plus for me. I recommend them.< /Review>

Every time I've had to call them regarding my parents they always keep me on hold for more than 20 minutes and when I leave a message, they never return the calls.  My parents also have this problem where they keep them on hold longer than 30 minutes.  I think it's time for my parents to finally switch providers.< /review>

<Review>My daughter has been with Dr. Alex Montes since she was born in my opinion he is a great dr and the only reason I've stayed with the medical group this long. The staff he has is incredibly unprofessional and rude, both the girls at the front desk are not welcoming at all. They never greet you, always give attitude and I've heard them while waiting for my apt talking about other patients. I feel as if they never worked in a customer service base job before and understand the importance what the say and how they deal with patients. Not to mention the HIPAA violations they're making. They really need to either give these girls proper trainning or replace them with more professional people. I will most likely be looking into other medical groups for my family.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>REALLY BAD SERVICE!...
Walked-in and told the front desk nurse that I'll like to pay for my baby's vaccine since she dont have medical or private insurance at the moment. And she told I have to wait and sent me to the back line of 6 people in line... everyone got attendance,, I showed up and she tired to make me wait. I told her I'll just like to pay for this time since I haven't got her in her dad's insurance, she told me they dont take cash patients.... when she could've just told me in the beginning and not make me wait. I was being so polite with her since the beginning when I showed up but I guess it was not enough. 😞</Text>< time>

Worst clinic ever!!! My daughter had an appointment today so I called to confirm the location mind me I called like for two hours straight but the staff was out to lunch (2 hours) and the rude “lady” that answered told me that they were going to denied service because my daughter has a balance due I asked what was the balance for? And she said she didn’t know. What kind of service is this??? I don’t mind paying but explained to me what is it for don’t just tell me bring the money with you. Definitely changing providers 😡😡😡

The receptionist are always rude and they always give you attitude. They should be trained all over again!! Sorry Dr. Montes your staff is so unprofessional!</Text>

<user_name>Dwight Rader< /user_name><Text>My experience has been outstanding. Allthough I was worried after reading some of the reviews my experience was much different. The front staff was very friendly and I was seen almost right away. I wasn't even done with my paperwork and was called in. 5 minutes max in the waiting room. I was seen by Nurse Laura right away and she was very kind, addressed all my concern's, and was funny as well. Never did I feel rushed and I asked alot of questions. I was able to get a referral quickly and was called by staff to let me know the referral was ready. They also mailed the referral to me.This was my very first visit. So far so good!< /Text><UserId.>104554238515144302746< /UserId.><pics>None</pics><time>1551892558111</time></record>

Switching drs.. This pediatrician always asked about my daughters other specialists opinion like he didn't have his own. (Daughter has special needs) Really only went to him for vaccines. He refused to sign a few papers specialists needed, he wanted to do it after hours-even though we were there for 2.5 hours waiting for that paper to be signed. And being there for 2.5 hours was normal for their office. And u think you will see the pediatrician till u get there and you're stuck with a rotating nurse practitioner. We Switched pedestrians last month, wish I would of done it sooner.</review>

So i went in for a checkup for my 9 month baby. N this is not the first time dr. Alejandro montes is late. N i get it it they have patients all day. However this isnt the first time i wait over an HOUR to get taken in. My appointmrnt was at 10 i was bearly in a room at 11 n my baby was already fussy n tiered n so im trying to keep her up so she dosent have to be woken up again n get checked. So i tell the dr. How i was frustrated n he starts to ARGUE! N basically tells me to find another dr. Which shows how much he cares about a patient. The last time i went in he completely forgot about me in the room n i had to get the burse n tell her whats goi ng on n she said omg he forgot about u i dont know why. I mean this is a   careless dr. Who obviousness  dosent care n he came back after the hour just to read the results.. the nurses there are amazing but he is by far the worst dr. Ever.. n hes a creep always whispering . My recommendation. Dont go to alejabdro. If his patients are expected to be there on time then we expect him to be there on time as well n maybe then he wont be so backed up ..n im not one to write a review but he was just so quick to argue. Even his staff is annoyed of him so that says a lottt.ive neverrr in my life gad an experience like this. Veryyyy upset .< /text>

I called at 8:30 when they are opened, they did not pick up until 9am. The women I talked to was VERY rude over the phone. The connection was bad so I asked her to repeat, she then sighed and began to yell with attitude. She must of had a harsh morning.</review>

This is our "go to" spot for most of our car and truck problems.  Sam is very nice and seems very honest and upfront with what is going on with your vehicle...and reasonably priced.  I like that when something's wrong he has brought us back into the garage , to see exactly what the problem is. I also like that he checks in regularly to make sure all vehicles are in working order. Very nice and friendly businessman. I would highly recommend.</Review>

I'm not sure what the quality of work is at this place is because they gave me some astronomical quote for my car repair, that took literally about 30 seconds I don't even think that they even took down all the right info about my vehicle. Basically just gave me the what ever price came to their head at the time which was kind of shocking considering my car needs some major work. Left a real bad taste in my mouth about them. Considering they were recommended by someone who did some major work at their shop. Can't say don't go there just make sure the quote they give you is at least has some reverence to your vehicle.</text>

Been going to Toyotapro for over 10 years, they have done the regular service on 5 vehicles during that time.  They are great!  I trust their judgement, honesty and quality completely.< /review>

I went here because they had good reviews. So far it seems like they have done a great job. They pulled my truck onto a lift as soon as I got there so they could go over any other issues. They found my coolant was leaking, which I didn't know about. The bill was just a little more than we agreed to but fair. Will definitely go back!< /Text>

<Review>Best auto repair place!!

I have a 2003 Toyota highlander that failed smog test so I took it to Toyotapro. They thoroughly inspected my car. They were able to tell me what was worth fixing. I knew that I need a new catalytic converter, so they replaced it and helped me in replacing oxygen sensor too. The cost was reasonable. The manager Sean was regularly giving me updates via email and text. When I went there, my car seat was jammed so the owner Sam personally came and checked the issue and advised me to leave my vehicle for one more day so that he could resolve it.

The next day Sam called me to get the vehicle and I directly went to the closest smog check and passed within the 1st go, I now have a registered vehicle without the nagging check engine light!!

I love it thanks to Sam and Sean and his caring experts at Toyotapro.

Literally the best auto repair place I have ever been to.< /Review><user_id>100543594816773150953<//user_id>< rate>

Honest and hard working

Toytospro auto care is the one of the best auto repair shops in Concord,CA. The owner is a wonerful man and a honest person. He gave me great deal on my BMW 5series. Where the dealers misdiagnosed and over charged me.he was also able to do a oil change for my wife's car with in no time.
I highly recommend toytospro auto care to everyone who's looking for a great deal and honest work.<//Review>

FYI ... Went there for an oil change.  Also to change transmission fluid.  They quoted $330.00 to change the transmission fluid and $95.00 for oil change.  I told them that I was not prepared to pay that much for the transmission fluid and they said since it was my first time there they would give me a discount and only charge me $285.00.  I declined the transmission service.  I later learned that the Toyota dealership only charges $ 230.00 for this same service.  Charging $100.00 more than the dealership is ridiculous!  Very disappointed. Unfortunately, but deservedly, they just lost this customer.< /review>

Frank is the best!!!  Toyotapro is the ONLY place I take my Camry.  They are efficient, and their prices beyond reasonable.  Very polite, very dedicated to doing the best job possible.  I very highly recommend Toyotapro!!!

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>This place is the worst. I took my vehicle here for an inspection, the technicians assured me that my vehicle needed a new engine.

I had a different shop give me a second opinion , turns out the engine is fine what it needed was a seal replaced.

You might want to try a different shop with actual experience in Toyota repairs.</Text>< Pictures>

That said, my opinion is obviously subjective, but, based on other posted reviews I'd speculate that the majority appear to share my subjective opinion. Keep up the good work guys!</Review>< resp>

Went to this place after a referral, was looking for an overall evaluation of my Toyota and if it was worth putting work into or if i should be looking for a new one. I was assured that all of the fixes on my toyota were minor... then the phone calls started coming in, this is broke that is broke. next thing I knew he had me up to $5,000 in repairs. worth more than the vehicle, and especially after the whole point of the visit was to see if i should keep the vehicle or not. But it gets better, after I paid for all of the repairs that I did not want I felt a heavy vibration on the high way. My lug nuts on my tire were not secured and MY TIRE FELL OFF on the off ramp. After having a near death experience with their repairs, I had it towed back to their shop to fix the damages and they tried to charge me again for the repairs! After getting it towed to the shop, they  put the incorrect lug nuts on AGAIN which damaged my tire and my break system. Had to finally go to my insurance to get my vehicle fixed.<//review>

I've been bringing my car here for over 5 years. The people here are so nice and they really know what they are doing. They will fix your car right the first time, and at a reasonable price.< /text>

I have been taking my car to Toyotapro since I moved to Concord about 5 years ago.  Frank and Camillo are both great!!  They have worked on both my Toyota and my husband's Honda.  I have found them to be honest and dependable consistently.  I highly recommend this shop if you are looking for a trustworthy place to take your car.< /review>

Really efficient service, great prices. They were very knowledgeable about my vehicle and provided on the spot quotes for repair. It is also right down the street from a diversity of food establishments, a bookstore and a movie theater.<//text>

I have to thank my daughter for pointing me in their direction 4 yrs ago.  I turn a wrench on my own vehicles so when I am stumped or pressed for time Frank, Camillo and the gang are my go-to shop.  You won't find better service for a better price in the area.  Always a pleasant experience, a happy vehicle and good conversation.  I recommend them to everyone I know and their experiences echo mine, that is saying something.<//Review>

I spent $1000 and they couldn't fix my Prius. They told me they'll do a better job next time so I spent another $600 and they still couldn't fix it. Wasted $1600 at this place and I can't get my $$$ back.<//Review>

Frank and the guys are awesome! I trust them with all my car maintenance. They are extremely honest and have recommended another service rather than overcharge me on several occasions; i.e." take your car to the locksmith because we'll have to charge you for looking at lock and then call them anyway."

I tell my friends I have a great mechanic.< /Review>

My Prius wouldn’t turn off and my trunk wouldn’t open and it was weird! I took it to Toyota Pro on my way from this happening and they knew exactly what the issue was. Since it was late in the day I left it there and walked home and got it the next day. Sure enough both issues were fixed and were separate issues. They got me back on the road in less than 24 hours!<//Text>

Toyota pro attempted to fix my center support bearing in my drive shaft. First time back on the freeway I noticed major vibrations and brought it back. They tried again and the vibrations got worse. I stopped at a driveline shop and they said my entire two piece driveshaft was completely out-of-fase. Toyota pro did not mark the factory orientation of my shaft before they took it out. "No visible yellow paint marking original spline position"
I returned and the boss man told me he has done this job many times and you don't mark anything. " it not a Chevy my friend " he said. I had to show him the toyota forum to prove his mistakes. They could not fix it after paying 400 dollars. I had to remove my driveline and pay another 375 dollars at sac driveline to have it completely rebuilt and balanced. Very shady vibes and nothing but lies from this place. Do not trust them. They will RIP you off and you will pay for more hassle than you ever deserved</text>

Reviewing Toyotapro is kind of a boring thing for me. I've taken my 96 Tacoma there since I bought it over ten years ago for all service, including an engine replacement at 286,000 miles. I make an appointment, drop the truck off at the scheduled time, the excellent mechanics do the work I ask for, they carefully look over my truck to give me a heads upon things that look like they will need to be replaced in the future,  I pay the price that they estimated or sometimes a bit less, then I take my truck home.

Toyotapro doesn't nickel and dime me on extras. They don't have sales quotas so they don't try and get me to pay them them to fix things that ain't broke. Sometimes I've wanted them to replace parts that didn't need replacing yet and they've advised against it, but went ahead with the work when I persisted. They even give me advice on services that they don't provide because they have a great base of knowledge and care about their customers and their vehicles. When I've needed major repairs they've advised me on the pros and cons of possible solutions then let me make my decision with no pressure.

So this is a boring review only because there is nothing to complain about. Toyotapro is exactly what would result from me designing the auto repair shop that fills my needs.</Review>

<review>Frank and Camilo are always super nice and professional. I've never had a bad experience in 7 years of going to ToyotaPro. It's nice knowing you'll get a quality job done without all the up-selling and markups you usually get at a dealership. Highly recommended.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Toyotapro was fast and true to their word. Went to Pep Boys just 14 months before to have new shocks , struts and tuned up rotors replaced on my Toyota Tacoma. The rotors began to shake when breaking and the over all ride was loose. Unknown to me one of my new rear shocks had busted at the weld and one raining day coming home from work on WHY 4 spun out and ended up facing the wrong to on coming cars. I had seen Toyotapro on my way home from time  to time and stopped in. They said that it would take one day for all of the above and did it !! The ride is like if it was new and will go to these guys for now on :)< /text>

<Text>The owner of this business was a friend of my friend. Friend needed wheel lock key for his 2003 Tacoma, amd was ready to buy it, when the owner happened to have a spare wheel lock key for his trick, and he just gave it to him. My friend did thousands of dollars in business with him in past, so he was just saying thanks for his business over the years. It's owners like him that retain cistomers because of random acts of kindeness like he did.</Text>< user_name>

I have used Toyotapro for many years, and have occasionally diversified to other mechanics closer to home.   When I have used other mechanics,  some of the problems with the car are fixed, and others are not.  With Toyotapro, all the issues are fixed.  Toyotapro are the best, and I have learnt my lesson about using other mechanics.  Frank and Camillo are incredibly knowledgeable, as well as being two of the nicest people you will come across.  Don't even bother going anywhere else.  For me, there is only Toyotapro now.< /Text>

I was looking for a great steak and stumbled upon this place while in California. Order it medium rare,  it came medium as in not much pink. Sin. Besides that, nice atmosphere and mixed drinks are perfect.  I'd go again honestly.<//text>

I was taken here for my birthday.  I'll be back -- the place is a knockout.  The staff is delightful, the drinks are well made and delicious, the steaks are very nicely prepared.  I had the New York steak medium rare and it came out perfect. My friend ordered the filet with equal success.  Highly recommended.< /review>

<review>Came here for my ninth wedding anniversary dinner....oh. My. God. The ginger beer brined pork rack was PHENOMENAL, and it paired PERFECTLY with the delectable macaroni and cheese. Our dinner was splendid, and they brought us a chocolate chip bread pudding with caramel sauce for dessert (on the house)! We will absolutely be coming back!<//review>< Time>

Came here on a weeknight with a reservation but probably didn't need one because it wasn't super busy.

My friend & I started with the pork belly which was really good. Super rich but melted in your mouth like butter.

They didn't have a bourbon menu, our waitress said they were working on it, but she recommended a whiskey she liked which ended up being delicious.

For our main course we both had the steak & frites (comes with bone marrow). I had mine rare and my friend had it medium rare. I didn't see too much of a difference between the way it was cooked but it leaned more toward the rare side which I didn't mind. The steak was fantastic, cooked & seasoned to perfection. The bone marrow was great, I dipped my fries in it.

Over all we had a great experience. The food was great, the price wasn't crazy and the service was very friendly and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend this place and will come back. :)</review>

Food was fabulous and drinks were stiff. Seating, well the place requires a reservation or you sit at the bar. I mean it was half empty and still we had to sit at the bar. Not all bad at the bar, just kind of inconvenient with people bellying up for a drink while you are eating. Did I say the food was fabulous?< /review>

Have had great meals and drinks here.  Went to the website for the first time and was surprised to see lots of steer heads and the repeated title of steakhouse?  Having been there a lot, I never thought of it as a "steakhouse" - I mean, I know they serve steaks... This makes it a bit difficult to convince others to try it.< /Text>

I would shy away from the "imaginative" items as seem to align with the description. This is not a large space, which makes it quite cramped to maneuver and will increase you wait time tremendously when they decide to place "squeeze"  a large group in the small window section up front - which is the best location.</review>< name>

Food was good, but service was a bit slow. We went in for Sunday brunch and it took a while to be recognized and get our drink/food orders. Would potentially try again on a different day.<//Text>

I'm sure this place is decent, but it's just not my thing. Expensive cocktails, cramped sitting, and boy you better be dressed up because you will stick out like a sore thumb. Visited once and haven't been back since.<//Text>

<text>Food is really good, but a something has happened to the service. They cleaned house and the friendly guys with the moustaches are no longer there. They have an all female staff that seems young and inexperienced. As a customer paying $18 for a burger, I want the service to be in line with the pricing. This place feels cheap and rushed now, but the prices are still expensive. A groupon is not enough make me come back.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x80857dc28b174311:0xee844a9fda5ab13f</GmapID></record>

Best Ribeye I've every had (not hyperbole)!

Went here for a birthday dinner and everyone was impressed with their meal.  The Bourbon Burger was great, the Mac and Cheese was fantastic, and the Ribeye was phenomenal!

Minus one star because we found ourselves looking for our waitress on more than one occasion and the restaurant is relatively small.< /Text>

<review>....ughm....err.... wow. the brain wants to express things but can't convey to the fingers what/how to type properly because brain has temporarily checked out to 7th heaven. It's pricey, but worth every savory fingerlicking fresh basil rosemary lavender butter dripping cent of it.

This place takes diametrically opposing ingredients and combines them in ways that will make your mind explode and implode simultaneously. Organically orgasmic drinks and super friendly (and super eye candy) staff!

Go here!

EDIT:
(Oh. . About food. don't eat everything on your plate separately...  you a will miss the flavour and wild experience. Don't be afraid to try the picked onion, Alaskan crab and bone marrow TOGETHER in one mouthful... if you don't, you'll just not get it)</review>< pictures>

I love eating on College Ave and this being so close to Rockridge Bart, there's no excuse not to come. Before coming here, I never understood the hype over $17 burgers. How much better could it possibly be? Truth be told, while eating the burger, I thought it was good but wasn't totally blown away by it. However, that night I decided to get my usual Habit burger to justify that the $17 burger was really not that much better. Oops, big mistake. There definitely is a difference and now if I ever want to taste a good burger again, I guess I'm just gonna have to fork over the money. Also tried the crab benedict which was good as expected.<//text>

Bourbon and Beef...two of my favorite things. What more can I ask for?!

It has a diner feel to the place but very modern.

I had a flight of bourbon...one of them is actually made in-house.

Then followed it up with a medium-rare ribeye.  It was actually overcooked but still well seasoned.

They had other items that were sold out. I went on Monday...they said the best time to go is on Thursdays..as that's when they restock on their food items.</text>

<Review>The food at Bourbon and Beef is underwhelming, especially for the price, and the lackluster service doesn't do much to salvage the situation; I won't be going back.

We got a table right away on a not very busy Monday, placed our order, and then waited 30 minutes for soup and a salad to arrive. The server apologetically informed us that their computer crashed and the kitchen never got the order, but it shouldn't take 30 minutes for a server to realize there's a problem, especially when nearby tables that were seated after us were already getting food. Once the food arrived the mixed green salad and french onion soup were fine, but everything else was subpar. The burger was laughably tall, and even if it had been short enough to take a bite it fell apart instantly. The ravioli was fairly bland for $5 a piece, and the fingerling potatoes weren't the least bit crispy.

Overall, Bourbon and Beef was a waste of time and money, and almost anywhere else along College would be a better choice.< /Review>< rating>

< Review>
Made a reservation for 11:30 which I glad I made because this place was getting full. We started off with a couple of Morning Margaritas and ordered the steak and eggs and duck and waffles.

I wondered why they would call it a Morning Margarita then I took a sip. It was a strong punch of alcohol and bitterness from whatever citrus they added, probably lime; for $11 each it was worth it. Our food came and I have to say I had one of the best steaks of my life. With the steak and eggs came with potatoes and this sauce. The steak by itself was tender, seasoned very well, and the fat attached on the side really heightened the flavor all together. I guess that happens when it’s grass-fed steak. The potatoes where cooked as perfectly as the steak, crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. Eggs were eggs and really there wasn't anything distinct.

I tried the duck from the duck and waffles and I have to say as someone who avoids duck because of the fear of tasting the gamy taste of duck this duck did not have it what-so-ever. It was delicious with the combination of the egg yolk and syrup. It did come with an orange jam which was very sweet and he used a little. For each entrée pricing at $17 (duck) and $20 (steak) so for the quality and taste of it, it was worth it.

Everything was going very well until I noticed a couple of the waitresses and a chef, the head maybe, where heavily discussing something because the looks on everyone’s faces did not look calm. We then had this waitress, not the one serving our table, to tell us to basically hurry up our meal. It went along the lines of “We don’t want to rush your meal but there’s a group who made a reservation that has been waiting for 45 minutes” I can tell you we were not eating for that was probably the total time of us being seated, ordering, waiting for our order, and eating. She then stated she can move us to another table and then reiterated to take our time but HURRY UP. I then asked if she can give us 5 more minutes, we were almost done. She said yes however the people who reserved have been waiting for a while.

You can figure out a better way to approach your patrons with this dilemma by simply coming in calmly but we decided to take the option, the ONLY option, of being moved to another table and finishing up our meal. The other table wasn’t even ready. . . REALLY?! So she basically threw the plate on the table and rushed away. My date was approached by the chef during this transition and was told his meal would be comped. My thought why not my meal as well? At this point I did not want this to ruin a really nice date.

Oh, even putting that aside it really was sad and annoying to deal with the check because after the fact the chef told my date he would comp him we were charged for his plate. So basically there was no communication between the chef and the waitresses who basically almost forgot about us. Glad though the waitress took the meal off when I mentioned to her about what was told.

Even though our first waitress was nice, this waitress [who is blonde, putting it out there] was rude,  didn’t work well under pressure, and not at least bit professional. Even though she gave us another table it felt as though it was a swept-under-the-rug scenario and there was no form of sincere apology. It was very, “sorry, sorry, sorry, I need to seat this party”

Usually with bad service I would come back to give it another chance. After having the service I had at Bourbon and Beef I wouldn’t want to come back. It left that kind of impression on me.<//Review>

<Text>I got a flat tire on my way to work and this shop is right down the street from my office. The owner was very friendly and accommodating! I brought my Mazda in with tire being questionable that it could be patched. These guys made it happen. Terrific service and attitude from all staff id certainly recommend it.<//Text><user_name>Jenn Hionis</user_name>< Time>

<Review>I had a great experience here! The customer service is excellent. I had to go back to work after dropping my truck off and I was provided with a ride back, and a pickup when my truck was ready. (My job is close by, so unsure of how far they drop off/pick up) I am not auto savvy…but Chris explained everything, kept in touch throughout the day with updates, and was very friendly. The mechanic (forgive me, I did not catch his name) was also very helpful and gave me instructions on how to do what I needed to. I have already set up another appt for my truck to be serviced here, and I highly recommend this shop.<//Review>< userid>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>The San Leandro location of George Oren Tire is a great example of why small business can thrive and compete against big box stores. If you're looking for the cheapest price you can go to a Costco or similar store or you will spend hours of your time waiting and being treated like cattle. For just a small amount more or actually sometimes even the same price you can have great customer service, knowledgeable staff, and not waste your time. I have used this location many times over the last several years. They always have in-depth knowledge of the tires as well as my vehicle. They have the knowledge to explain things well and for me at least most importantly their service is fantastic. They're on time, organized and don't waste your time. I can recommend them with absolute confidence.</Text>< Pics>

<review>I don’t think anyone enjoys having to take their car in for maintenance, but the folks at George Oren in San Leandro are great and made the whole process a breeze! Drop off was easy, I was given status updates, they even did some additional work for me that wasn’t scheduled and I got my car back the same day. I also didn’t leave feeling like I paid an arm and a leg, and I’m really pleased with the work they did. Everyone was friendly and professional, and I really appreciated the extra measures they’ve taken to keep everyone safe (masks, hand sanitizer, sanitized pens, etc). I highly recommend them!<//review>< Gmap_id>

My company truck had 2 rear tires that needed immediate replacement. I explained the urgency as it was our delivery truck. They immediately took me in and within 45 minutes was back on the road. Amazing service, quality tires, and happy employees.

<Text>Super friendly staff and great service.  I was able to make an appointment easily by phone to get all 4 of my tires changed and balanced.  I opted to wait and the whole process took about 2 hours or so.  All the staff had masks on to ensure public and personal safety due to COVID and had hand sanitizer at the counter.  They had separate baskets for clean and used pens for signing paperwork.  Overall, great experience and would go back again.< /Text></record>

<text>Overall generally good shop that I’ve gone to for years but with this tire I just that I asked them to think about my vintage tire wheel and not pull of the weight if they could. Turns out the amount of the weight was just fine. But I get there and the pulled it off and also chipped the wheel paint  in various areas then just put the same weight back on 12 inches around the wheel. Couldn’t you just of rotated the tire on the wheel a bit as I asked? And left it where it was? They didn’t even attempt  it. At least you could have given it one attempt.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This is a great place to go to when u have issues with low tire pressure or flat tire. They attend to you right away and the guys in the office are very helpful and nice. Kudos to the guy/mechanic who fixed my car tires & who showed me what's caused my flat tire. I'll definitely recommend this place to my relatives and friends.</text>

<Text>Wandering around Oakland, too scared to cross the bridge on an almost flat spare tire, I found this place, which has impressive reviews. I pulled in, two hours before closing on a Friday before Christmas. I was immediately greeted on the lot by a friendly and efficient specialist, who listened to my issue. He found a bay for me within minutes. Next I made my way to the office and met the kindest, sweetest, friendliest receptionist ever. She, too, is efficient, and took my information. The owner was sitting at his unassuming corner desk, busy on the phone with orders. Lots of friendly customers breezed in and out. Next thing I knew, my car was ready. Total bill for a repaired tire, relief, finding a hidden gem? $30. I will be buying my next set of tires here. I wish everyone was so professional. I wish everything was so easy.<//Text><time>1577202723485</time>< user_id>

Great experience! Went in for a leaking tire that Subaru told me was just because of temperature changes, no holes they said. George Oren's team quickly found a nail and patched it up. In and out so quickly it was amazing. Really nice folks, thorough work and very affordable. I have found my new tire place! Thank you!</Text>

Spoke to Randy on Wednesday to see if I could have them replace rear shocks on my tahoe, he mentioned he couldnt promise anything but if I dropped my truck off friday he could possibly get it done. If not then it would be done on Monday. Thankfully he got it done on Friday considering one of the shocks was in real bad shape. Randy is hands down a key asset there. I will definitely will be bringing my cars there. Very professional and polite. Thanks again Randy!< /Review>

The mechanics were friendly, easy to communicate and work with.  They answered my questions with patience and kindness.  The price was very reasonable.  They patched one tire and rotated 4 tires for $50. (It probably would have costed more at Tesla.)< /review>

The folks at George Oren, Oakland, are superb. They know their business, have competitive prices, and are professional in going about their business. I recently bought new tires, and two weeks later, ran into a pot hole that destroyed one of the tires. The manager replaced the tire at his cost. No questions asked. It doesn't get any better than this!
I recommend George Oren to anyone looking for new tires, or for a place to repair tires.<//review>

<text>I brought in my 90 Jeep Cherokee for full suspension repairs. Replaced all bushings with plastic derlin, shocks, and front steering shock. I mean this Jeep was mostly original. Maybe shocks were replaced once before. Broken motor mount, headlights needed replacement. You get the idea. But it has a replacement motor so putting $$ into this makes sense, plus it’s a off-road collectible now. Randy worked on it for a week or so while needed parts floated in. He worked a miracle on the suspension.  Added new Goodyear M&S tires too.  Drives like a dream. I took it up to 75 and no dreaded Jeep death wobble. I’m very pleased with the results and fair pricing! Plus, Randy kept me updated on progress and recommended work. Yes I recommend this shop.<//text>< Pictures>

The San Leandro George Oren has excellent, friendly service. Compared to the Oakland George Oren, which is dreadful, the San Leandro store did the work exactly as I requested on my  vintage 1960s restored wheel with no damage at all. I strongly recommend this San Leandro branch. However, do not go to the Oakand Branch of George Oren. If you do, get ready for wheel damage.< /review>

<review>I was coming to the studio one morning from the city and my left front tire started to go.

George Oren Tire was able to fit me in within the second wave of business and I had to wait less time than I would at another tire service (Except for Boris - but that is another story) and the same amount of time I would wait at at oil change service.  Pretty performing.

Plus, the manager was able to evaluate and recommend quickly and cost effectively.  My service began shortly thereafter following a pleasant conversation with another customer who bragged she'd been bringing all her vehicles there forever.

But before I let the sparkle get the dazzle in my eyes, I waited to see how things went.  My tire needed plugging and they found another that needed plugging that I didn't even know about while performing inspection.

The manager told me that because he had already quoted me one price for the first plug, he wasn't going to charge me for the second one.  He said he was not a pump and dumper, and I laughed with him.

Things went great and he did a free rotation included.  It has been running well since, but my experience working in service stations taught me not to rely on plugged tires so much as new ones, and Oren management advised rightly so while simultaneously estimating two good new tires for the maintenance of my vehicle.

About three weeks later when I was looking for the money to grab two new tires where the plugged ones were running, I got a 20% discount coupon on service which would have brought me to less than 100 dollars each for the new tires installed.

Unfortunately, I couldn't catch that wave, but I bet he will honor the offer if I brings in the June expiring coupon sometime this July.

Even if he doesn't I recommend their service to everyone and rate highest my own experience with George Oren Tire Specialist.

The LC

UPDATE: 7/14/2018:

Glad to hear my coupon is still valid and I look forward to conducting business soon.

I have had good luck with their tires and can take them in for rotation and air check at any time. It is good to make an appointment for anything more than air though so you can get right in and out. I have found that my tires need extra TLC with all the potholes and they are there to give it. My car always feels good when we leave.< /review><gmapID>0x808f8fe7a5999677:0xbb47b19d11158a08<//gmapID>< rate>

I am really happy I found this place. They really take good care of me and my car. Super helpful and friendly. The first time I went he saved me money by telling me I only needed two tires, not four.  So I will be a long time customer. Thanks!!<//Review>

Very supportive. I thought I had a big problem but they solved it in 4 hours. I requested four tires and an alignment. They did it all for a competitive price. Handled taking me home and picking me up. I had absolutely no hassle for what I thought might be a bigger problem. What a relief!</Review>

I dropped off my flat tire and since not a lot of crew are working that day, I was told to come back after 1 1/2 hours and pick up my tire. I came and not only was my tire ready but they put it back on and placed my spare tire back in the spare tire rack. Thank you!<//text>

<Review>Horrible communications! Had an appointment to come in and they called me the day before and said they had me scheduled for CT scan , but I was coming in for MRI ! Since I was sitting in a barbers chair at the moment I said I would check my paperwork and call back in 20 minutes. When I called back ,I was on hold for 20MINUTES before a woman answered and said I would have to call a different number . I called that number and was again on hold for a long time , got frustrated and hung up. I tried a third time and got through to the office and was told to hold for the original person I talked with. After about 5 minutes , a recorded voice simply said "Goodbye" and hung up . I finally replied to cancel my appointment via text . Won't go back to any of their locations, they're too swamped and don't have enough office staff to assist clients.< /Review><gmapID>0x80dd26e9452d0097:0x86916054e6dc4ed4</gmapID><time>1623285413821</time>< Pictures>

I am a 74 year old with incredible back pain issues. They Gave me an 8:40 PM APPT on Friday night.  After the procedure about 9:30 the technician said I was done and immediately ducked out a side door never to be seen again. I got dressed and Gathered my things all alone in the dimly lit back area. I found my way alone to the reception area where the attendant was locking up the doors to their suite. I told her my husband was picking me up and would be there within 5 minutes and asked her if I could wait in their reception area. “Nope, we’re closed. You can sit out there” pointing to the large general reception area for the building. She immediately left and I was all alone in this empty building whose main door right ON Beach Blvd was-unlocked. I was in pain, alone and abandoned in this empty unsecured building. Didn’t feel any concern for my comfort or safety at all. I have made two calls to the site and to the manager of the site and they never called me back. DO NOT GO HERE ALONE AT NIGHT because they’re not going to extend any courtesy or concern.<//Text>

<text>Had MRI and once in the back for imaging the staff in the back are incredibly kind and professional. Front staff however are not. My insurance also called since they over charged me and my insurance rep said that she was sent to billing and a rep named Shante was extremely rude to her. Unfortunate,  bc this facility is very clean and if not for front office staff and billing staff would give a 5 stars.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1623175806412, 'text': "Thank you for your feedback.

I had  no problems with the service at the facility. I was there for a CT Scan in October 2020. It's what happened afterwards that's the problem. I was told no copay was due, that I would be billed. I guess I was billed and it was sent to this address: 1234 Huntington Beach, CA. Needless to say, I never received it, so it was not paid. Now we're being hounded by a collection agency. We called Radnet/Memorial Care 4 times to try get this resolved, and spoke to 2 different supervisors, who told us not to pay the collection agency. We're still getting calls from the collection agency. We made more calls this morning and waiting to get it resolved.

We had a similar experience several years ago after a visit to the Huntington Beach Memorial Urgent Care facility.<//review>

I was in a lot of pain when I went to my appointment however the technician Brittany was so kind and gentle,  she truly made my experience very pleasant. I m extremely pleased. I was treated with the most kind heart and gentle spirit. She treated me as if I was her mom or someone she genuinely cared for. I would recommend this imaging place above any others. Brittany thank you so much for your professionalism and care.</review>

On both occasions, the facility was clean and the waiting area is spacious and comfortable. I was greeted by the same woman both times. She is very professional, prompt and friendly. There was a very brief wait. The technicians made eye contact and introduced themselves. Today, I had the pleasure of meeting Asia. On each visit, the technician communicated with me and explained everything that they were doing. I can't imagine how anyone could do better. It was a great experience and I'm extremely satisfied.</text>< rating>

Calling was an experience to say the least when asking for directions the lady at the front answering the phones was so confused. While sitting in front of the building I asked if this was the correct place she said that the building was white and grey. So I asked if the suit was upstairs or on what side of the building and she replied no it’s a grey and white building! I was entertained honestly. Staff was chill great service very fast.<//Review>

The receptionist had the paperwork already prepared so it was quick to fill out. Then the Technician immediately brought me into the imaging room. She was really sweet. After the MRI was done, it was a quick sign out and I was on my way. It was an easy in and out process and of course, they took all the necessary Covid protocols.<//Text><UserId.>112482099400666863093< /UserId.><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>The technician who performed my ultrasound was excellent. During the process she explained everything as she was doing it. She was thoughtful in making sure that she prevented the gel from getting on my clothing, as well as making sure I was comfortable on the table. In general, her “bedside manner” was stellar. I’m sorry I forgot her name.

The receptionist was also polite and efficient.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>My appointment was the perfect appointment. The check-in process was simple, quick & easy, maybe took 3 minutes. My Technician (Nicole) was very professional, she explained the Sonogram process in detail (Thank You) and made me feel very comfortable during the process. She’s very passionate about her profession and the service she is providing.
She checked and rechecked the area examined
twice to make sure she didn’t miss anything.
Thank You Again

<Text>Even whilst we all adjust the to COVID-19 era, Memorial Radiation were kind enough to squeeze me on a same day double MRI scan.

The two Ladies at the reception were most kind and efficient at their various duties and compassionate towards my injuries.

All appropriate CDC guidelines are strictly observed and fellow patients were of the ‘aware’ folks causing no drama for staff or Patients- which was nice to perceive.

When in need again of Memorials services - and my condition shall assure that, I shall not think twice of returning.

If a human reads this- I would be most grateful were you to take a moment to thank the 2 Ladies on duty at 16:00hrs yesterday 6/21/20

Excellent communication prior to scheduled appointment.  It was requested that I arrive 15 minutes before my appointment.  I did so, and had time to complete needed paperwork.  I only sat and waited for 5-7 minutes before being called for my appointment.  The technician, Melody, who completed the test was excellent.  She described fully what she was going to occur throughout the procedure.  She also asked if I was comfortable a number of times.</Review>

I arrived 1 hour prior to my appointment time as instructed. However, I waited for an hour and 30 minutes in a freezing cold front waiting room with no one keeping me updated. (My test required that I was fasting and I had to drink 3 big glasses of water!) Finally I went to the desk and she took me to the back waiting room and a nice woman gave me a blanket. Everyone was very nice but I felt like I’d been forgotten. I don’t know what happened but I think the communication could have been better.</Text>

Asia was so great!! Asia was so professional because of my knees and back I’m severely handicapped. She stopped twice for me and could not have been kinder! It felt so great to receive outstanding service like that. I appreciate her so much! Whatever you are paying her it should be more! I am retired from big business but if I was still  supervising, I would hire her away from you in a heartbeat! Thank you for having such a great employee and person like Asia! Merry Christmas! I will always recommend your facility!

<text>Very courteous, quick, and professional staff. From the front to the techs, they all make your more than likely bad experience (since I’m sure your not there by choice or for the best of reasons) as good as can be. Also, quick turn around on results which helps you to not play that long thinking game which is the worst.  if you got to get some testing done, I highly recommend here. Quick and painless. Well somewhat painless considering I was in pain before I went in...</text>< Pics>

Great experience. My CT tech was kind and very good at his job. Didn’t have to wait long after my appointment time. Nice facility, free parking. Honestly doesn’t get much better when it comes to having to go to a medical appointment.<//text>

How does this place have this high of a rating? 2 hours and counting of waiting after being told 1 hour. Not enforcing masks, with people wearing their masks over their chin in a small waiting room. Go elsewhere.< /review>

<Text>First time at this location.  Front desk was kind and efficient.  The gentleman who took my CT scan was warm; calm; kind and reassuring.  Something very sensitive and special about him.  I wish I could have gotten his name in my memory!!  I'd like to mention him by name.  He also made sure I had the key where my belongings we're located. In a nutshell for a very sensitive issue I felt safe, cared for, protected and respected by him and the front desk staff.<//Text>< Time>

Had a spine MRI here this past week and it was fantastic!  The facility is super modern and clean.... the reception desk had the most helpful and friendly staff that checked you in and out.  The technician, Asia was so professional and explained the entire procedure, seem less!  As a complicated orthopedic patient, I truly enjoyed the staff and the modern facility.  Great job Memorial... I hope all of my diagnostics can be done at your location!<//Review>

Memorial Care Imaging Center is well organized. They greet you when you come in and are quick and efficient checking you in.
They call you in to get your tests run quickly. The technicians that run the tests are friendly , helpful and good at what they do. I would highly recommend
Memorial Care Imaging center.<//Review>

I had to get an ultrasound here at 9:00 Thursday morning, and my experience was nothing but positive!  The staff was hella professional; the receptionist notified me that the technician was running behind so I may wait longer than normal, but still it was less than 10 minutes.  The ultrasound tech was efficient and friendly, and helped me understand the process better.  Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs imaging done.</text>

<review>I had such a great experience! I walked in on a Saturday to get several X-rays and Alex was awesome! He got me checked in, verified my insurance, explained how every series of X-rays was going to happen, and was very patient with positioning me since I have mobility issues. He is an amazing technician and person. While I was leaving, an elderly couple was waiting and he was so sweet to them as well. Thanks Alex!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<text>I had a great experience here last Friday, 12/21/2018. I didn’t have to wait around too long, staff are helpful and informative. The technician who administered my CT scan was exceptional. He informed me every step of the way so I would know what to expect and didn’t get scared of the unknown. He was also very gentle with the needle.

<review>My experience at Memorial care imaging Center was all that it should have been my paperwork was waiting for me, everyone I dealt with was pleasant and personable, and the technician who took care of my MRIs was considerate, efficient, and thorough. He took care of everything in a very professional way and was very clear and his explanation. I was seen on time, and the process was finished in a timely way. The only negative in my experience was all of the paperwork That I realize Hass to be done for a procedure such as an MRI.< /review></record>

This is a beautiful new building! I came in for an MRI (not a fun experience) but Jacob was understanding and patient and guided me through it. As a new patient i filled out some paperwork and they called me back pretty quickly. Thank you Alex & Jacob.< /Review>

This morning I went to MemorialCare Imaging Center in Huntington Beach for a CT. I was very happy with the service and care they offered. I was greeted upon entering the reception area and everyone there was very courteous and friendly. I was called promptly and everything was clearly explained. I was treated with respect. I recommend this Imaging Center very highly. They are professional and caring.<//text>

I wanted to share the experience I just had with Memorial Care Imaging, both the Newport Beach and Huntington Beach offices. I was scheduled this morning for an ultrasound at 8:30am, and unfortunately I received a call from a representative at the Newport Beach office that their ultrasound machine was not working. Instead of just scheduling me for the next time that their machine would be functioning, the representative, whom I apologize for not remembering her name, made the effort to reschedule me for just under (3) hours later at the Huntington Beach office. Upon arrival, I was immediately greeted by a young man who checked me in (again, I apologize for not remembering his name). He was very professional, attentive, and helped make me feel comfortable. He was not only that way with me, but also with other patients who checked in thereafter. Nicole, the technician who conducted the ultrasound, was just wonderful. She was also very professional, attentive to my concerns, and very trusting from the moment she called me and took me back to the examination room. I just left their office, and I will say that this was one of the best experiences I have ever had. Thanks to everyone at both the Newport Beach and Huntington Beach offices for making patients like myself feel comfortable.< /text>

Very professional! Walked in, filled out some quick paperwork because it was my first time. I had to do some xrays. I was in and out within a half hour. I will come to this location in the future if anything is needed for me and my family, even though it’s a little out of my way. Thanks!!< /text>

I was able to get my X-ray but had to make an appointment at another place. It’s not like it used to be when we could get them in the office.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>The office receptionist is so nice as well as very professional and welcoming! The office is peaceful and very clean with ample styles of seating to make anyone comfortable.
The technical staff (x-ray, mri) are amazing! They are highly skilled in their particular fields and very efficient. Your comfort is a priority during your testing and they will work to obtain top quality images while ensuring your safety and comfort.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>The front counter women were great.  They were patient and helped when needed.  Unfortunately, the man who helped my mom to x-ray was not helpful.  In healthcare you have to be companionate with patients.  My mom has knee problems and it is hard for her to walk and lift her legs.

Fat lady in the front was very rude and does not have good communication skills and does not know how to speak.  I see mostly positive reviews but maybe she was in a bad mood or maybe just a disturbed person. I shouldn’t be calling her fat but her attitude was disgusting and I cannot believe she picks and chooses who she wants to be nice to.< /Text>

<Review>Reggie was very kind, explained each step of the procedure, and was efficient. The whole office kept things moving, but not in a pushy way. My only complaint is that it is hard to see numbers on your building, and the door one drives by says, “ Kidney”.  I spent more time looking for the right building than I did filling out forms and being scanned. It was such a positive  experience.  Thank you.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

My appointment was on schedule, however, when I arrived, the staff seemed a bit  overwhelmed and almost too busy to handle the number of patients and there was not enough seating in the waiting room.  When I was greeted by the gentleman who did my MRI, he was professional and comforting.</review>

The MRI I had done here was so fast.  They had the nicest girls at the front but the MRI tech Asia was the Sweetest!  I hate needles and barely felt anything.  She was so gentle and kind.  I would absolutely recommend anyone to this center!! 5 plus stars!!</Review>

<Text>The staff here is very polite and helpful.
I called early in the morning because of a concern about a broken rib. They were able to squeeze me in and confirm there was a fracture.
Definitely recommend this team.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>They were very professional. I had to pick up my kids from school, and they were able to get me in proptly to avoid me being late. I have also been trying to tackle a kidney problem for several years, and had no luck. Today I had a wonderful ultrasound technician who finally caught something. Now I am on my way to resolve the problem. I was loosing hope and starting to think people didn't believe me. 😢<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

The staff was lovely! But,  there was something resembling a drop of blood on the coach. I mentioned it. Then after MRI later because waiting room had filled I forgot & sat on it. Luckily Not blood, but sticky red candy on white pants. 😩</text>

The mri Tec was fast and didn’t ask permission to to lift my legs for a bolster resulting in extreme pain. He needs to learn to be more tuned into the person  he’s treating, and a more compassionate person. Right now he’s a “hot shot.”<//Review>

<Text>From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with friendly and attentive individuals behind the lobby desk. My appointment time was 10:30 and I was escorted right on time by Reggie. He was extremely personable, attentive and responsible.He was able to calm my nerves and I felt I was in good hands. He "walked" me through the procedure so that I would  know what to expect. All in all, an excellent visit surrounded by excellent personnel!< /Text>< Time>

Very friendly and helpful front office and nursing staff. No long wait time. Dr. Mitchell is awesome and put me on the right track to good health as well as eliminating an issue I have had for some time by immediately ordering exrays, physical therapy and acpossiblr surgeon, if needed for the future. I was very satisfied with my experience at this facility.<//text>

Clean, neat, organized. They keep you well informed on what they are doing  and are very timely. Nice, new building but a bit cold especially when you are barefooted getting your xray or MRI.< /Review>

I had a CT scan of both legs done here.
Staff was very friendly, the place was very nice and clean, and the best part is that I was seen on time.  I would definitely recommend Memorial Care Imaging Center.</text>

<review>I was surprised that I came I on a Wednesday and they wanted to schedule my appointment for the following Monday. Usually if the dr orders tests it’s due to an illness or condition and is time sensitive. Other than that the staff was pleasant  although not overly friendly or concerned. The procedure was scheduled for Friday and only took a few minutes.< /review><user_id>113616728316425337849</user_id></record>

<rate>5</rate><Name>Tracie Hall< /Name><text>Reception area comfortable and provides water and maybe coffee. I didn't visit the table and don't recall. Receptionists are friendly. My MRI technician was friendly, I got to wear my own clothes (stretch pants and sweatshirt) because clearly had no metal in them and removed my glasses. I'd come prepared for no metal with no jewelry (or any metal clasped underthings) so after leaving purse in locker could go straight to MRI room. My tech, Asia, was super helpful in alleviating the anxiety about a possible claustrophobic attack, explaining that you go in feet first, get earplugs AND a headset that plays lovely music, AND a squeezy bulb to cling to if you need her.  She warned the machine makes hideous loud noises.  I closed my eyes til close to the end when I opened just one and wished I hadn't for how tight the space was but I was able to stay calm for the few minutes left...15 total for my left side sciatica symptoms.  Was so pleased to come out alive and, even better, without having made a fool of myself!  They handed me a CD of the scan and let me know the Dr. would receive the report within 3 days.  I think that it's because I mentioned, in passing, that I would be seeing her later that afternoon, that they were able, and kind enough, to get it to her before I got to her office 6 hours later.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1541258873393< /date>< gmap_id>

I went in on a Sunday morning to have a MRI. My appointment was at 9 am, and I was out by 9:45. Super fast, the receptionist was nice, the girl doing my scan was sweet, and the hand you a CD to give to your Dr.< /text>

The office staff was so nice to squeeze my son in for an ultrasound after his doctor appointment so that I didn't have to come back later in the day. The technician was very patient with my crying screaming child. The radiologist was very nice to take time to talk to us.<//Review>< pictures>

Immediately following referral from Urgent care (same building), when I checked in at imaging center desk; I was advised there was one person in front of me, and approx. 20 minute wait for my exrays opt be taken. At least 10 people were seen before me and was nearly 2 hour wait - totally unacceptable. each time I questioned my status, I received nothing but nonsense responses, from team manning the the appointment desk.
Very poor customer service!< /Text>

< review>
I am very pleased with my care from my doctor and staff at Memorial Care.  The new facility has everything right there and therefore I didn't have to go several places for the required tests.  The doctor takes his time for my questions and staff is very friendly and seems to care about my wellbeing.  I believe I have found a wonderful group of health care professionals.  Thank you for giving me the chance to share my thoughts about the group.</review>

Memorial Care is great. The Imaging Center is in a brand new buildings. There is plenty of free parking. The staff were awesome! Scheduling the appointment was easy and they got me in right away. Josh called me the night before to confirm and to give me important information about the appointment. Josh was also there in the morning to greet me. He is very friendly and efficient. When it came time for the MRI I was a little stressed out because I am claustrophobic. Aja who performed the procedure was fantastic. She put me at ease. She was very friendly and personable. She explained the procedure which helped me relax by knowing what to expect. She explained that it is a newer machine and that the new machine was a little wider so I didn't feel as confined. She put some headphones on me and played Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon for me. Next thing you know it was over. Have no fears about using this place. It is a first class operation.</review>

<review>Make sure you call your insurance company first! The girls at the front desk will lie to you to get you to have services done that you can not afford.  I set up an appointment and was told I would only have to pay 95.00 then showed up for the appointment and was then told its 475.00.  I said sorry, cant afford this now and was about to leave when they stopped me and said hang on we will make some calls and see why that amount went up.  They assured me not to worry and all i would owe is the 95 but later on i of course got the bill for the difference.  My insurance company said they see this happen often.  Lesson learned, call my insurance first.  Not cool that they lie to patients to trap them into services they can not afford.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
When we arrived, there were 2 people in front of us and yet our wait was 2 hours for a 5 minute xray, people kept coming in and they were called before I was. I was told by the receptionist it was because they had an MRI and an Xray, it really dosen't make any sense to me, maybe it has to do with $$$$?</Review>

Staff was great, facility was clean and ambiance was nice considering it’s an urgent care. Just gave 4 stars because it took me two hours to get in and out (exam and x ray). Will visit again.</text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>Everything went well except at the end. I stopped by the checkin desk and ask a women sitting there if they needed anything else from me. There was a man standing behind her that snickered. It may have not had anything to do with me or my question but it made me feel uncomfortable. She then asked me what proceedure i had. I told her but was kind of taken aback as there were a room full of people that could hear me. I would of preferred she just have asked me my name and looked it up. This also made me feel uncomfortable. The tech that did the proceedure was very respectful, thorough & pleasent.</Text>< Pictures>

They actually took my ultrasound before my scheduled appointment time and was out in a few minutes.  Very nice facility but need to put the address on the building to help locate, many patients had difficulty finding it.</text>

This place is so disorganized and sloppy.  I tried getting an MRI and it dragged out for months.  The Memorial care call center is a joke and will keep you on the phone forever, like calling the DMV.  Save yourself the hassle and find somewhere else to get your imaging done.<//Text>

Great experience with the actual testing (ultrasound), but it was so difficult to reach the office, sort out insurance, etc. I spoke with multiple people, and it was definitely a frustrating process. I’m glad it’s done.< /Review>

<text>The check in process was very disorganized. There seemed to be more laughing between the staff then checking people in. I was there  almost an hour which is too long for a chest X-ray.< /text>< pictures>

Long wait and front receptionist was impatient and kept making funny noises to her co workers really un professional like. The seating is limited and the waiting room setup does not seem to accommodate disabled people.< /text>

We waited for over 40 minutes alone with no other people in front of us, then had to wait another 20 minutes because an even greater emergency came in. Had they taken us in, we could have been done long before the bigger emergency came in...<//Review>
