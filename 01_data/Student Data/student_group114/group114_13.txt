I have had nothing but bad experiences in the last three years. I have been a patient for over 25 years, I have taken my kids, my husband and my mom there. I have had several issues with the front end staff and now my daughter had a really bad experience with Brittney one of their technicians. I must say I have stayed with Morris Eye Group because I loved Dr. Bodman (even thought she is no longer there), I love Dr. Amalari and I adore Wilma she has always given us the best customer service and has helped with our glasses needs for that last 25 years. They are what keeps us going back but after the last incident my daughter had I can say you will loose customers. From the front desk treating my mom so rudely twice, to my two insurances being billed for the same visit to now Brittney treating my daughter the way she did I am considering leaving the practice. Sad because the doctors and optician are amazing but their front end and back end staff needs better customer service training.<//Text>

Everything was fine with the eye exam. Thanks. However, I would suggest that you expand your office waiting room some (it’s really tight in there) and consult with a ‘human factors’ professional to make it more comfortable and exciting, i.e., healthcare environments don’t have to be like, well, waiting rooms.<//review>

The worse place ever, if I can give o start I would, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. They're staff unprofessional trying to rush out, not giving a chance to ask any questions..ohh my God guess what, they not disinfecting their equipment after each person, even doctor Tara herself didn't disinfect before or after me using the equipment, I swear you can see the dust on the machine lens,..I was very very disappointed..I had a horrible experience , there was other horrible things, such as the wait time,  and trying to walk you out the door as soon as possible as I said u don't have chance nce to ask any questions..I would never go back there..very stressful environment there..plz go somewhere else to have your eye checked<//Review>

My last visit to Morris Eye Group was nothing short of outstanding. I had no wait time before being taken back for my tests and once completed I saw Dr Amalari strait away. He did his normal superb job of asking the right questions, keeping things lite and then going about his task while keeping you informed of what and why he is doing what he is doing. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I highly recommend Morris Eye Group to my friends and family and go a step further by telling them to ask for Dr Amalari.You can't go wrong with any of the Doctors or technicians at the Vista location.

<text>Horrible experience.  Customer service was aweful. I arrived early for my visit. I wasn't greeted professionally at check in. They were in a hurry to take my $15.00 co pay. I waited 20 min past my appt time. Never seen the optometrist until the very end of my visit. The lady who helped me was extremely rude and not communicative. She had a horrible attitude the entire time.  Dialated my eyes horrible. Then spoke with a man about my payment. He insisted I pay out of pocket and use my benefits to purchase contacts with them. I refused to purchase contacts with them. I wanted to use my benefits to pay my contact exam. Not to mention he would not tell me the price of the contact exam. He charged me $85.00 out of pocket. Then last step to see the optometrist.  Who never examined my eyes. He was very rude only question he asked where was I going to purchase my contacts. I told him I did not know. He left the room to come back with 1 trial pair of contact and said have a good day. So I left. Only to find out they billed my insurance $70.00 for the contact exam. Total contact exam $155.00. And guess what I was dissatisfied with Morris Eye Group.  I went to get a second opinion. On my vision and my contact and glass prescription were totally different and my eyes are much better. Also the exam was $50.00 dollars cheaper with no co-pay. This place is a total rip off. So glad I didn't purchase contacts because the prescription was wrong. This was my first and last visit. Total rip off. ....</text>< Pics>

They don't rush through the exam and completely and satisfactorily answer every question.   They make you feel more important to them than just a job or another customer or paycheck.

Had such a great experience here! Everyone is so nice and the office is run very efficiently.  They answer the phone right away, text you your appointment time, and you can even make appointments online.  I met with Dr. Butler and absolutely loved her.  She was so personable and kind and gave me so much time.  I've never felt like an eye doctor truly cared about my eyes, vision, and well being like this place did.  Highly recommend!<//review>

They have their process nailed down! One stop shop, advanced technology, and friendly staff. Before my visit, I was able to schedule my appointment online, received an email confirmation, received a text reminder. Upon arrival, my new patient on-boarding was simple and quick. Two very friendly technicians examined me and I was able to peruse the frames while waiting for the Dr. Butler so the time flew right by. My contact fitting with Dr. Butler was great. Morris Eye Group has fantastic technology, and she was able to show me pictures of my eyes to explain what she was talking about. I selected them as my primary ophthalmologists as they can provide a host of thorough examinations, my glasses and contact prescriptions, in house surgery for Lasik assuming I am a good candidate for that procedure next year.<//text>

<Text>I've been using Morris Eye Group for my optical needs for 4-5 years now and find the office experience to be  truly professional and well organized.  I love that  the technicians who do the prelim tests are so friendly and they tell you what each procedure is for and how it'll work, so never a surprise.  The Dr. that completes the exam is also very professional, and goes over information carefully and clearly...I would highly recommend MORRIS EYE GROUP for you next eye exam and you'll keep going back each time you need eye care.   They seem to have the most up to date equipment and testing processes in the local area.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This place is amazing. I've been to many optometrists but this is by far the most compassionate and thorough team of eye specialists I have ever been to.

<Text>They failed to order contact lenses after my daughter’s eye exam. Waited over a month and when I called to check on my order, a woman said they forgot to order which I was fine by me (we all make makes). But the woman offers no apology. Instead she exhibited an extremely snarky attitude on the phone as I gave the wrong birth year of my daughter when identifying my daughter’s order. She rushed the conversation from the beginning and now more apathetic and rude, certainly didn’t try to hide her sarcasm during the entire conversation.

Doctors and nurses were great. I have been taking my children there in the past three years.

But on the administrative end, the service has been extremely superficial and apathetic. I will never go there again.</Text></record>

<text>I had a wonderful experience with  Dr. CODNER he was extremely caring and had real concern for my problems with eyes. He explained in detail what was going on. He took the time to show photos and answer all my questions in terms that I could understand.
Jeremy  the eye glass Dept took the time to look up my insurance they didn't cover any my prescription.
He told me the cost and gave me an option to save a little money by using my frame.
He was not pushy and gave me his card so I could think about things. He make the experience delightful 😄
Emma did the majority of my eye test. She was gentle with positioning me for test. She didn't lose PATIENCES if you moved. She was thoughtful caring and had a sweet disposition with a beautiful smile.
The reception area was friendly and ready for you. Not talkative between themselves leaving you standing their.
They have a water dispenser some candy in a bowl magazines up to date and a very clean restroom. They parking lot has handicapped spaces.</text>< Pics>

<review>I've been going to the Morris Eye Group for 2 years and every time  I visit I am impressed with the receptionists, the technicians, and the doctor, Tara V. Each exam is very thorough, the technicians are pleasant and friendly, and the doctor is both knowledgeable and informative.  I've been very pleased with all the aspects of eye care at Morris Eye Group.</review>< date>

This place is very clean, I was very comfortable. I highly recommend Morris eye group if you need an eye exam. They are very professional in what they do, and they will take good care of you. Again this is the place to go for an eye exam, and for prescription glasses.<//text>

<review>I've been there twice. Both docs I saw were competent and friendly. My only issue with this group is that you do not see the same doc every time. With a chronic, progressive disease the patient would find it reassuring to have one doctor following your case. Otherwise it seems like "medicine by the numbers," scary when your eyesight is at stake.<//review>< pics>

I have been trying to get a hold of someone for days, just to get a prescription for my son's contacts.  Now I have to drive there just to get a hold of someone.  Also, they up sell you on everything, so just when you think your insurance is going to cover a basic eye exam, plan to fork out another $200 for all of the other diagnostics testing that was recommended.  I was shocked when I got the bill.  Be sure to ask if it's covered by insurance before you agree on doing any diagnostics testing.  It's questionable practice and thought I would report to the Better Business Bureau.  Tread carefully there.<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I been a patient here for year and without these doctors I literally would not be able to see. They gave me my sight back, and I would not go anywhere else. The doctors are compassionate and take the time to explain things to you in terms you can understand. When you have an appointment with a doctor here I would plan on staying a bit longer than told as appointments usually do run over, however it is time well spent. I have had both good and bad experiences here over the years but the good far out-weigh the bad. As I said earlier I would never go anywhere else.< /Review>

<Review>I had a terrible experience at Morris eye group.  I would not recommend any to this establishment.  Optometrists perform needless tests and perform needless fittings.  The doctors and staff show more apathy than any other business that I have been too.  I recommend that the establishment rethink the methods in which they conduct business, or the loss of other customers is inevitable.  Also, the return policy needs to be honored along with customer care.  I tried returning glasses because of the terrible service and arduous, extensive testing that I had to undergo to get the correct prescription.  Instead of giving me a refund, they insisted upon performing further examination in a sadistic manner.  I personally recommend empathy training for all of the staff.<//Review>< Pictures>

Had a piece of metal in my eye and went to the ER.  After 5 hours they took it out but only did half the job.  The eye dr. at the Morris Eye Group got me in the next day and finished the job right away and was amazing.  Super knowledgeable, and very nice.  Did a great job.</text>

< Review>
Dr. Bodman is terrific and I will miss her. The customer service is beyond bad. I went in personally to just give the OK that my contact lens prescription was fine and couldn't do that, so I left a message with my name and number. Two days later, still no phone call from them. I called today and couldn't get through so I emailed them. It took over 2 months, several phone calls and emails before my son got his contact lens prescription. Customer service is AWFUL!!!  My doctor has been great, but don't get sucked in here. You will regret it...  so sad....< /Review>

Coming to Morris Eye Group litterly change my life. I researched heavily in terms of price and the quality care and this place came out on top. Courtney helped me out every step of the way and Dr. Katzman made my experience of getting Lasik really fast and easy. If you’re searching for a good place and a good doctor, stop wasting your time searching else where. You will not regret the highest standard of care that you will be provided for at this location.

I am the type of person that really thinks things through, especially when it comes to doing Lasik. I regret not doing Lasik long ago. It totally changed my life. This place should be 5/5 stars btw.< /review>

After 13 years, I continue to trust the Morris Eye Group with my eye health care.  Still happy with the cataract surgery from several years ago.  And Dr. Viechnicki has been helping me manage my pre-glaucoma with regular visual field tests and a recent Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty.  Both the doctors and the staff at the Morris Eye Group are top notch.</review>

I had a wonderful experience on Oct 27 2017.  I was told my appt would last 2 hrs. But after cking in
I was seen by the first person within 10 minutes. Then sat for a couple of minutes and Shannon took some scans of my eyes .Next thing I know they are calling me back to see Dr. Aminlari. I was in and out within 1 hr. I would recommend this practice to any of my friends.  I am always treated with kindness.  I have been going to them for at least 8 yrs.< /Review>

<review>My family had a great experience here.
ME....it was OK.

My turn to come in....and I realized you have to really question them on what they are charging. They must just have an abundance of people just walk in and hand them cash  no questions asked.

I asked a question and questioned some charges......and it came down HUNDREDS of dollars......so basically I was going to get take advantage of. Oh and they get really snippy with you when you catch their mistakes.

** ASK WHAT THEY ARE GONNA DO.....CUZ THEY JUST ADD SERVICES....AND SAY.." well they told you when you walked in they said it may be more"

Imagine going to get a set of tires and they just do the brakes and shocks too because they looked bad....oh and here's the extra bill for it.

NOT PROFESSIONAL IN MY OPINION.<//review>< Pictures>

Worst place ever. The doctors there are wonderful but the customer service is beyond horrible.. Very rude. Also, I ordered a pair of frames and such over two months ago (they told me it would only be a month), but that wasn't the problem, the problem was they never answer the phones when I would call to ask!! Never. Someone would pick up then hang up! THIS PLACE IS A JOKE. I went in to ask instead and they told me they will call in one week, been 3 weeks- no call! I cannot drive without glasses keep in mind.</Review>

<text>Stay away! Make sure you know what you're paying for, and what they are submitting to your insurance. I saved over $100, by asking, and then calling the insurance company. Aetna called Morris's office, and got me my money back. Also expect a VERY long wait. Morris has his office staff over book, so a 40 minute exam usually takes about 2 hours.</text>< user_name>

<review>I sat on the phone for over 20 min. With the receptionist giving him my medical insurance information. After he had all my information he said someone would give me a call a day before the appointment to make sure my insurance was accepted. I explained to him I wanted to MAKE SURE the insurance went through before requesting work off and he assured me if there was a problem theyou would call me.. long story short I took work off only to be told my insurance was not accepted and that they tried to call me but couldn't even thought I gave them my number 3 times... heads up if you have medi.cal they don't accept it even if they say they do< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1477598499654, 'text': "Being as clear as possible with insurance information is always our goal, Monique.

I would never recommend this place!

1. They scheduled me with the wrong doctor.
I have been wearing contacts for over 15 years and they scheduled me for a regular eye appointment. I was there for 2 hours and they tell me I have to make another appointment to see a doctor that will design my contacts...then I have to wear that trial pair and if they fit they will give me a Rx. Why would I need to see another doctor to check contacts that I wore when I came to this place and I have been wearing for over 10 years? Oh thats right...you scheduled me with they wrong doctor and the doctor that I should have really seen wasn't even there.

2. Watch what they charge!
My husband went there on 10/9/14 and was charged a $10 co-pay. I went 12/9/14 and they charged me a $35 co-pay. They don't know what they are doing. I have VSP and federal insurance and there should be no difference in the charges.

3. Section where you pick frames ect. has no clue what they are doing!
My husband went in on 10/9/14 and paid the contact fitting fee of $55 and paid the difference in the frame cost which his total bill came to $105.....(his frame was $225 and scratch resistance, reflective coating, lenses, and polycarbonate was all covered) he received 6 month supply of contacts and glasses for a total of  $105.
For me...the girl was trying to charge me for everything that is covered under my insurance and told me that they use a more premium lens? The frame I chose was less expensive than the frame my husband picked but she told me that it was going to cost $391. I would also have to pay a contact fitting fee. I would have to come back and see another doctor. And who knows if the would charge me another co-pay? Oh she tried to tell me maybe my insurance changed? Yeah sweetie I am sure it didn't change in 2 months!

4. Never did they try to get another individual check to see if there was an error. I asked to she a manager. TORI didn't even try to help. She said I can see we aren't going to please you and we will give you your co-pay and not bill your insurance...like you have never been here before. SHE LIED! She called me the next morning and told me they are going to have to bill my insurance? So now they are trying to bill my insurance....when they scheduled me with the WRONG doctor?!? I had to call my insurance and file an appeal.

Horrible customer service! Incompetence in scheduling appointments! Lack of knowledge. Tried to over charge me! Pure waste of my time!!!

I have been working in health care over 10 years as an RN and would never ever recommend this establishment to anyone! Future customers be aware of your benefits and don't let them fool you. Patients and customers have the right to choose with a wide selection of reasonable places...this eye group is not one of them.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>Extremely satisfied customer! I got Lasik done by Dr. Morris 2 weeks ago and just found out yesterday at my second follow-up appt that my vision in both eyes is now 20/15. Before the surgery I couldnt see anything more than a few feet in front of me without contacts/glasses. Really didn't know what to expect with the procedure, but other than being a little anxious, the surgery was quick, pain free, and took no more than 5-6 minutes per eye. I was only in the procedure chair for about 15-20 minutes and once they sat me up I immediately could see better than I ever had in my life. Vision was 20/20 the next day at my first follow up appointment. Went back to work 48 hours after the procedure and have had no complications or problems now going on 2 weeks post-op. I highly recommend Dr. Morris and his team for anyone considering corrective vision surgery or even as a regular patient for exams, etc. which I am as well, (Kudos as well to Dr. Burke who is my regular "amazing" optometrist with Morris Eye Group and was also a part of my Lasik consult/follow-up process).</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I didnt catch the name of the guy who pierced my ears but awesome service! Called in for my friends and I and he said he can squeeze us all in before his next appointment. He did 8 piercings in 30 minutes! Minimal pain and easy aftercare instructions. He talked to us all to try to calm our nerves, very friendly and gave us a lot of background on his career.</Text>

<review>Came by for friday the 13th, and got my tattoo done by the professional and friendly Michael. But I cant forget the awesome Big Ron that worked on multiple of my girlfriend's tattoos, so pleased with how they all turned out. Highly recommend anyone come any day of the week.<//review>< response>

Popped in here this afternoon to see about getting one of my nipples repierced. Their piercer (I didn't get his name) was friendly, professional, quick, and even going through my scar tissue, it only hurt for a second.

I may have found a new favorite piercer!

Clean shop, nice staff, not much parking though.</Text>

Heard bad things via FB over this place, but I went, and I was NOT disappointed. Steve is the man, the realist, honest, best tattoo artist in this city. And the best piercer. I go to nobody else for my tattoos.<//text>

Fantastic shop.

I had driven to Lancaster to get pierced, but the shop I made an appointment with closed early. With only twenty minutes before closing time, I called every shop I could find, Pokerz was the only one willing to stay open for me. The artists were incredibly nice and accommodating, the shop was clean and well kept, and the piercings are strait and true, despite my squeamishness.

I am glad I found them.<//Text>

Everyone was super chill and patient, considering I was nervous for my 2nd tattoo. Chris put me at ease and did an amazing job in my tattoo, while Ron did my husbands and was super laid back, yet professional about everything. They do superb work here.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Good concept on subs, good bread, but the two subs I tried taste the same, like salt with a small hint of grease and bread. It would have been a lot better if it was less salty.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjTRf2IvXzHe0uSHThGnP-EBT0fsS6x3xV3Lqt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< response>

<Review>I placed my order online for pick up during my lunch break at 11am. I received an email confirmation and then another email that my order would be ready at 1030. So I took an early lunch break, walked over and was told that my order was not ready and that I misunderstood the email and they hadn't sent it. They then quickly put my sandwich together. The food is yummy, however, the service left quite a bit to be desired. I will think twice before ordering here when I have a limited time frame to pick up and eat. If you have time to wait, this place is a nice lunch spot.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>I had the Steak Sandwich and the HUGE Tater Tots that easily fed more than 2! It was ALL delicious and I can't wait to try all the amazing different sandwiches, different style Tots, sauces and more! EXTRA POINTS for being DOG FRIENDLY on the patio!  Oh, the bread is also baked fresh right at an East County Bakery! I support Small Local Businesses, so me and my pooches will make this a regular spot! I also noticed a Hobo Special! A BEER and a Sandwich for $8!! I pay that just for a beer at surrounding places! There are T.V.'s to watch Sports too! Win/Win!  Yayyy... :-) On a different note. the staff was very friendly and the restaurant AND bathrooms were very clean on my first visit! :-)< /Text>< rate>

< Review>
Twice I have ordered a sandwich "all the way" and brought it home. Only to find out there was no lettuce, tomatoes, onions or mayo on it. Disappointed to say the least. I even called and left my phone number to be called back, to no avail. No reply at all. It used to be a good place for a sandwich. At subway I can actually watch them put on the veggies, here I can not.<//Review>

<Text>Ordered one cold turkey sandwich and waited over 20 min for it. Asked for it to be cut in two and wrapped separate and they couldn’t even accomplish that. Wouldn’t waste that much time on a sandwich again. Sorry guys that’s pathetic.

So after eating part of the sandwich I decided to go from 2 stars to 1... dry bland bread wA crumbling as if was old, lettuce was limp and onion wasn’t crunchy more so chewy I didn’t even eat it. Best part was the pickle 🤦🏻‍♀️<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Gmap_id>0x80dbfd549313144b:0xd46fb8f92ff62dbf</Gmap_id>< Date>

Just ok. Always smells like they haven't changed their mop water in a while. The big drain in front of the soda machine is a huge hazard. And the food isn't consistent. They are frequently out of things. Not one of my top choices for sandwiches. Not even in my top 3<//review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>We ordered a sandwich online. It got check off as being ready about 15 minutes early, so we went straight there. Unfortunately, it was not yet ready oh, but we did figure out what happened. The guy who was going to make the sandwich clicked on the order in his system. He thought that meant he was making the sandwich, but apparently that sends a message to the customer saying it is ready. Okay, that's nobody's fault. Just a miscommunication. While we were waiting for the sandwich, I decided to order some tater tots to go with our meal. It was called something like Josh's mess. We're vegetarian, so I ordered it without the pepperoni. Unfortunately, that came with the pepperoni. The food was delicious, but the service was questionable. It did appear that they were busy doing training, so we are giving them a pass on this one awarding four stars. Usually, they are pretty good.</text>< date>

Service was friendly and order taking process is fast.  The prep time for the food took some time.  The sandwich was made to order and it was served _really_ hot and that takes some time.  It wasn't really busy so it felt like a bit too long.  I don't eat many subs but I'd rather come here over the others in town.<//Text><Response>None</Response>< user_name>

My boyfriend and I love going to Growler's Sub Shack! Upon our first visit we actually got to meet the owner who is a really nice guy. He's a veteran, and a local, small business owner. (Big fan of supporting local!) The place is clean and charming, the staff are very friendly and helpful, and at the end of it all- the food is great! Lots of variety of sandwiches, chili fries, salads, soups, and more. We stop all the time to get these tasty gourmet sandwiches (we love the meatball sub, the sausage sub, and the cheesesteak ones) on our way to outdoor adventures, or for just a "picnic" at home. It's in a great location and is worth a visit! Forget the big chain sandwich shops and give a taste to some of the best sammies I've tried in a long time a try! What do you have to lose?<//Text>

Wanted to try the new place out so ordered online and sent one of my guys to go pick up the order.  I had a combo on one order (add tots & drink).  When my guy came back, no rink no tots.  Also, they seemed to completely ignore the add-ons (grilled onions, peppers, etc.) So I called and asked for a refund of the difference for the missing combo.  After several minutes waiting listening to the cashiers try to figure things out and take other people's orders, the guy finally came back, apologized, and said he didn't know how.  He gave me the phone number to the manager.  So I called her.  She was out driving so asked me to send her details to her email.  I did.  So far, 3 days later, no response, no refund.
Now, as to the food:  Aside from the orders being messed up, the sandwiches are small and not very good.  Not worth the price.  Too bad. Was looking for another good sandwich place.< /text>

Tried it 3 times and should have quit after the first. Poor service, wrong orders, and overpriced. Stick to Subway or treat yourself to Submarina (Antonellis being the sandwich Cadillac in East County).<//review>

Only second review I have ever written but felt the need to. This is no Firehouse, if you our thinking about going here rethink that, I waited for 30 minutes during lunch time on Friday for there signature sandwich. When I arrived there was no one in line. I see no reason for it to take 30 minutes for a sandwich during lunch time on a Friday except poor management. Once I got the sandwich it was even worse. They call it  a Growler but all it is a so so Bratwurst with some sauce and grilled onions with peppers,. I got a bag of chips & soda for $12.00!!!! Needless say I wont be back again.< /Text>

So disappointed! If I hadn’t already parked the car and gotten my family out, I would have chosen somewhere else to eat. They got rid of their soda fountain, so their limited beverage selection left my son drinking water. They also got rid of their small size sandwiches. The prices are way to high for this type of sandwich shop. We won’t return!<//Text>

Firehouse subs used to be there, kinda had that same vibe.  Maybe they bought them.  Idk, it has great food though.</Text>

Absaloutley horrible! Worst sandwich place I have ever experienced! got me and my dads sandwiches both completey wrong. Smelt horrible in there it smelt better outside and cleaner. My dad ordered a sandwich with everything I guess that means nothing on it... they put wheat bread on my snadwitch instead of my dads I can’t have weat and he is supposed to have weat he got my white bread on his sandiwitch he can’t have white bread! Completely dry,  turkey tasted like bacon and was so so salty. I will not be coming back sorry. Submarina is a lot better. I’m sorry I wish I had a better experience here I had high hopes. We are very disappointed because now we don’t have time to go any where else for lunch. :(< /Review>

< Review>
Former store of Firehouse Subs. Same owner. Possibly a woman named Nic. Excellent sandwiches but same hi prices as when Fhouse was around, ~$2+ higher than they should be, (to be competitive with Subway and Jersey Mike's I'd say). But so good once in a while! I see they're applying for a liquor license..hmmm..🍻 Tater tots!</Review>

I ordering two sandwiches, a veggie and a ham, Turkey, bacon.  The veggie had nasty, what seemed to be canned mushrooms, which I was told were sauteed, I paid extra for avocado which i got small pieces throughout the sub, jalapenos that I did not ask for l, and it was soggy.  My husband ordered lettuce, cucumbers, and jalapenos his sub.  He just got ham, Turkey, bacon and jalapenos. No lettuce, bacon or cucumbers! Polite staff, not good subs.< /Review>

My wife and I went for lunch today. The sandwiches we had we're good. My only complaint is if the manager is going to reprimand an employee they should not do it within earshot of the guests of a restaurant.<//Text>

<review>Sadly the place was a let down. The service was so so not great. The two sandwiches my wife and I ordered were not good and seemed more like a bad salad on bread then a sandwich. I spent 28$ dollars on two footlongs.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><user_id>116527893408496941303</user_id></record>

<Text>Ask Jake for any questions you may have! My friend and I were in town visiting family and came in on a Sunday with major car issue. Knowing pretty well there wouldn’t be any mechanics open, we were hoping to get advice on where to go for help and their employee(Jake) offered to look up the parts our car needed and fix it on his lunch break. He fixed it up right away and did a great job for us to make the 5 hour drive back home the same day. We would’ve been stuck without him! Great service!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Me and my wife Naudia we're stranded in bishop California our Harley Davidson needed a starter relay they personally pulled out the stops they provided tools, battery charge, nuts bolts, flash light and an attendants own personal 15 amp fuses at no cost to us even though they unfortunately did not possess the starter relay for my bike. Their service is under parallel to any I've ever experienced in my past of customer service! I'm 48 been there and done that all over the continental US never had I been treated with such respect,support & home town kindness. Bishop California's O'Reilly Auto parts is by far the most helpful,respectful team in all the many auto parts stores I've shopped. You guys ROCK orally the awesome work.
Me and Naudia as well as our beautiful Harley THANK YOU.</review>

My alternator went out on my 2002 truck, towing my travel trailer... on a Sunday, so I was desperately hoping they had one in stock. They did! After I replaced it my hand were very dirty. I think the guy behind the counter was named, Creek, but whatever his name is he was awesome! He let me wash my hands there too! They really saved my trip!</review>

<text>So my brother Jeff texted this to me today. Thank God they’re safe. I wanted to share what happened and say how grateful we are for good people out there. Thank you, Oreilly’s!...

................................................................................

“Well, we could’ve been killed last night on “pitch black” Hwy 395. Dad’s alternator died at 1:30am last night while we were driving those 2 lane highways. Lucky for us there was a place to pull over. We called AAA and they towed us 60 miles to Bishop. Went to bed at 3:30 woke up this morning and changed out the alternator and back on the road.
The guys at the auto parts store even loaned us all the tools. They even opened a new package of sockets for us to use and didn’t charge us.  So cool of them.</text>< pics>

Although the website claims that they have and provide "Loaner Tools," this O'Reilly store does not loan out any tools... Not even a tire iron, because "you can hurt yourself" was the employees response. Seems like false advertisement to me, when their website proclaims that they do have a "Loaner Tool" program.<//review>

<review>I jumped into my car and my battery was dead.  I borrowed jumper cables and my next door game me a jump.  I drove my car around for 15 mins.  I drove into the O'Reilly Auto parts and ask do you still test batteries for free.  The answer was yes, he got the tester, told me turn my car off.  I never thought what if it doesn't start, he smiled and said I will give you a jump.  After receiving the test he said I definitely need a new battery.  The one in my car is four years old. I have a great mechanic so when I get paid at the end of the month I will have him buy me a battery and install it for me  I have tripple A, so if doesn't start guess who I'm gonna call for for a jump. O'Reilly Auto Parts store has a reliable mechanic, fast and friendly service.  They help you with your car no matter what gender you are they never ever take advantage of you.</review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80be163f1b8ee4b5:0x2d8b62a964375b15<//gmap_id></record>

Clean parts store with nice friendly staff.  Since this is a chain location they have all the standard Oreilly merchandise, and can locate parts in that network.  No complaints about this location.  Also the management worked hard to personally help me locate out of stock parts.</Text>

They got this dumm girl brown skin black hair she might be native wich it explains how bad she was in knowing nothing about cars. I was dissapointed to know she dont even know anything about oils nore filters. Gave me the wrong ones charging me over $40 plus for and oil quite frankly she didnt wanna work there. She had the worst attitude. Thanks to a friendly #459968 male cashier i was able to take home the right oil and filter. Why does oreilly hire this kind of people.<//review>

<Review>This store is terribel. Don;t give them your money.
Spent a ton of time on the phone ordering parts for following day pick-up. Guy on phone that was not helpful at all told me he had the parts and they would be there.
Well... guess what.... went down to get parts.... he had not pulled them nor was there any record I called and ordered parts. This place sucks!!!!!!!!
People are not responsible for anything. Typical freakin California employees. I'm going all the way up the chain on this one. This BS is not excetable... people should lose their jobs for sure. idiots.</Review>< pics>

< Review>
Cheap tools with a poor selection but big selection of auto parts. Absolutely the worst customer service in Bishop ! You can hear four or more guys B/s-ing behind the racks with nobody assisting customers.

I took a wheel bearing in from a trailer. The person behind the counter tried to sell me the wrong size bearing, saying, "This what everybody else uses!" I asked for a set of calipers & measured the ID of the bearing he brought out; it was 1/16th of an inch larger!?! I went home and located the correct bearing online, O'reilly's website stated  this store had four in stock.

Don't get me wrong, there are two maybe three knowledgeable & helpful employees, but the rest are worthless.</Review>

< review>
Don’t waste your time getting service for your phone through AT&T in South Lake Tahoe. GO TO VERIZON in South Lake Tahoe ! If you choose AT&T your service will never work, nobody can help you get the service you paid for to work, you can’t get a refund, you will be screwed. You will end up speaking to someone in Asia 3 times a week for 30 minutes at a time having them run troubleshooting that will never work ! You will get new SIM cards and your service will still not work ! You will get a new phone and your service will still not work. The only way your service will work is if you go to Verizon ! I’ve been a loyal customer with AT&T for 13 years and spent over $10,000 dollars with them not including all the phones I have bought through them. I have had such horrible service and customer service with AT&T. I am never going back to AT&T. Verizon is the way to go.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>This place is great!  The products on display are kept very neat which you can tell the employees put detailed attention to their potential sales.  In addition, you can tell the staff does extensive research regarding the products in the store considering the knowledge they have and how fast and accurate they can answer all your question.  I came here during black friday weekend and not even knowing they had great deals and it was immediately offered to me.  I was helped by Gabriel, who was very patient with me considering I had to make two trips due to self inflicted funding issues (black friday, enough said) going back and forth to the bank.  So far, I got two note 9's and a hydrogen one from this place at a great deal!< /review></record>

<text>I would give them a lower rating if possible.  These guys are scam artists.  They charged $200 to my credit card and did not put it on my phones and refused to admit it because their receipt says it was applied to the phone.  Also purchased a phone for a friend there and when we got home found that it didn't work.  We took it back the next day and they refused to even exchange it for a new one or refund the money.  I do business at a number of other AT&T stores and all of the others would have immediately resolved these issues.  Save yourself a lot of grief and use a different store or a different carrier.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

If I could give them zero stars I would.  Worst customer service I have ever received.  Completely lied to at the point of sale regarding the insurance policy for my phone and then the manager was unwilling to help in any way and even threatened me with police force after I told him it might be better for me to come talk to him in person.  After all that he refused to give me his store number and was a complete smart-a##.< /text>

<Text>First storage ever and it was a great experience. The office staff, Marie and Jennifer have always been pleasant and very helpful. I read the reviews before I rented here and a few concerns were security. I never had any issues and liked the fact that the facility shut down at 10pm. The first month free was amazing, lol. I didn’t plan on renting here as long as I did but when it came time to end this relationship, the ladies made my transition easy.  Although there is no dumpster accessible to the tenants, I understand why. Facility was always clean and free of debris, payment options easy and hassle free. Hopefully I will not need another storage unit, but if I do, I will definitely be coming back. Thank you ladies for a very positive experience.<//Text>< Pics>

This storage facility is a great value. We’re storing our fifth wheel there. The staff is very friendly and very helpful. The registration was very quick and easy. The staff is very professional and I would highly recommend this storage facility.</Review>

< review>
I stored my motorhome here and after only 3 months of storage, my catalytic converter was stolen. The facility knows they have a serious issue with this and have done nothing to improve security. The gate is easily scalable. I even spoke to the district manager and asked what was being planned for increased security in light of the continual theft issue and he said nothing is planned. The monthly fee also increased during this 3 months. I do not recommend storing your RV here if it has a catalytic converter as you won't have it for long. $3000 to replace and none are available right now due to Covid backlogs apparently.< /review>

Just six months ago your reviews were averaging about 1.2 or such if I remember correctly.

Second I would like to point out that I was spend $245 a month total with your business, which after a few years represents a substantial loss for your company for dealing with me in a way that made me feel that I had to leave.
You will need to force place a lot of insurance on people without their permission to make up that 245 dollars each month.<//review>< pics>

I could say hundreds of great things about my experience, but ... I’ll cut it short!
Everyone at i Storage made it easy!
We were looking for a place to park a pop-up trailer. One or two friendly phone calls and it was done.
I emphasize the word Easy!

<review>Run! Do not trust this location with your coach if you care about it! Parked mine there at the beginning of the year. Price was decent, access was ok. Manager was rude to someone on the phone while I was sitting there, then shared her opinion of the person after hanging up. Took a deal (1st month free), but she tried to get me to “take the month later.” I declined and wanted it as promised that day. At the end of the paperwork signing she decides to tell me she has had  a rash of thefts in coaches parked in her yard. It’s not her responsibility and you pay for their location at your own risk. In addition, she shared it had been “months” since she had any problem. Well low and behold, my coach was robbed of the catalytic converter. Cut right off! When I went to the office (in a mask), I was received with a locked door saying they aren’t letting anyone in the office. She tried to talk to me through a window. In that moment I was moving out, I asked how to close out my account and move my coach out. Her response was, “just take it and go.” I mean, no service, no accountability, no conversation.
She (Marie) needs to go and an overhaul of this location. I am so happy with my new storage. Accountability, communication and customer service. Totally worth the extra drive to have real peace of mind that someone who is taking money is earning it. Sad that it cost me $1500, but lesson learned. I should have run away when I first met her on Day 1.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80db18a45c130fbf:0x8202217a715cdad8< /Gmap_id>< user>

<Text>STORAGE WAS BROKEN INTO. Someone switched the lock on my storage and the manager told me that her boss could come in and open it for me in the next couple of days. The guy showed on the day my rent was due, in which I was set for automatic payments. I had asked to have my payment on hold and the manager told me I had a 5 day grace period. When we got to my storage, the other lock was gone. I opened my storage and found my stuff was stolen. They told me I had to call the Sheriff's department to make a report and then I could fill out the insurance paperwork only after I had a report. It's been weeks and the report still isn't complete. And aside from that, the report costs money. I can't file the insurance papers because I don't have it. Plus they charged me the rent on my storage and won't give me my money back. And they have the audacity to tell me that it was either they return my rent money, or I get my insurance money. Worst place ever.</Text>< gmap_id>

< review>
I have been with this facility for almost 3 years. There is no surveillance going down the aisles of the individual storage units only as someone enters and exits but there is surveillance in the rv area. There have been squatters as long as I have been a tenant here who leave their trash everywhere and other items the office staff is responsible for cleaning up majority of that. I am friendly with other tenants that have run across similar issues as mines. When in need and the office is not open and we cannot get  our doors open, we lose A-day of work this has happened on several occasions with no one on site or calling customer service to get help. I believe this facility is not managed properly as the vandalism and theft continues and they cannot catch the people who do these things as for the lack of surveillance cameras. The office staff has been very helpful but they can only do so much. Today I have been at my unit unable to open the door since 615 as I took the appropriate action in calling customer service at 6:30 they put in  A work tickets. The manager called me and said he would try to get ahold of someone but couldn't guarantee that this would be taking care of within 24 hours. Meanwhile it is now a quarter to 9:00 a.m. I got no call back from the manager regarding having someone come out physically to help me since I have lost a full day at work and unable to lock my unit to leave that the facility.  This situation has happened to another tenant as well and the thing they could do for her is have her move everything in her storage  To another storage in order to keep her  Items safe. She lost 2 days of work. As when it rains hard, the roofs leak and with the insurance that you pay for monthly, anything of value is not covered on the insurance policy I found that out the hard way. If you are planning on storing any of your personal memorable or priceless items I would look elsewhere where there is actual surveillance covering the entire facility, because this one in my opinion is mot secure. I am disabled and unable to physucally moved a huge unit to another facility nor can I afford to hired movers to do it or I would of done it along time ago.< /review>

iStorage was a pleasure to work with.  I was looking for storage for my 5th wheel, after several unsuccessful calls I came across iStorage and they couldn't have been nicer.  Not only did I reserve a space they gave me my first month's rent for a penny.  I look forward to working with them for a long time, to come.  Sincerely,  Marilyn S.<//Review>

<Review>My price at the store differed from what the computer said it would be, and the price was $25+ more than the year before.  I had a very unsympathetic girl checking me in and she used the negotiation technique of not responding to my question, But rather just repeating her mantra of the space and price over and over.  She also waited on someone else until I said I needed her to finish with me as I had people waiting for me.  Just a total different experience from last year, this year was not as good or welcoming.< /Review>< Rating>

I recently won a storage unit at auction in D.H.S. Ca. I was a little confused about some issues, being one of the first lockers I ever won, that is until I met the Manager Marie, and her coworker Jennifer.  They made me feel quite at home, and content to answer all my questions.  Even after I bit off more than I could chew, they stepped up and both helped me out.  Who would have thought that customer service, would have been so Top-Notch especially at a storage facility.  Every time I pulled out of the yard, I felt as though I was leaving a 5 star hotel, as a matter of fact the service was so good  I even rented a unit before  cleaning out the unit I won.

Thanks again

Can’t go 5 stars since we just moved in and we’ll see over the next year how things go, but Marie at the front is incredible in her customer service! (Who remembers anyone at the front’s name, right?) she’s sharp as a tack, honest and funny! Loved working with her and her flexibility!< /Review>

I was extremely satisfied with the customer service I was given a couple of weeks ago; I was helped in a professional, and timely manner. This place is clean, organized and had everything that I needed for storaging purposes. I was able to buy a few boxes and tape for a very reasonable price. I highly recommend this facility, and will definitely be coming here again for any of my storage needs.<//text>

After a month lighting in the storage unit was no longer available. Both of the lady's in the office told me it had been reported. I finally called in to report it myself a month ago. Never received a return call, I have to use multiple flashlights especially in the early morning, evening and night.
On top of the to other tenants have told me their units locks had been cut open and belonging stolen. I saw one empty unit wide open with a cut lock at the doorway located on my row of units that just the day before was secure.
I found cut locks laying on the ground outside the facilities.
I've been here fore four months.

<text>iStorage met all my needs in storing a 23' Sprinter.  Initial check in was thorough and efficient.

I love the 24 hour access! Prices just increased so I'm taking my RV out. Prices for storing furniture is by far one of thee most expensive in the desert!! 🤑💰💲💸For the increase, at least define the RV spaces and number them. Great customer service though! The ladies are very nice.</review>

Be aware that they do not do partial month payments.  You go over one day, you pay another month.  I will have to move my trailer for 4 days.  So although the rate looked good it is actually double what other places that charge only for time stored.  Dissapointed to find that out on arrival.</Review>

I recently moved items with their uhaul rental truck and also purchased moving supplies & boxes they had everything I needed for my move which was great, the manager and office personnel on duty were extremely helpful and pleasant suggesting the right supplies for all my needs, the customer service was excellent and friendly, The facility was clean & organized and the fresh scent in the office showed the level of well maintained standards, I will highly recommend ( Istorage ) to my friends & family and will definitely be returning in the future for any and all my rental or packing supply needs......

My entire trailer was stolen from there! And one thing for sure is that it had to be an inside job. My neighbor had his RV there as well and his converter was stole from his muffler.</Text>

Clean and well kept. One of the cheaper options I had found during my search and had the unit for a year. Had I still had a use for the items inside, I would have stayed with them. Various sizes available that are detailed well on their website. Covered parking for RVs and trailers available as well. Due to its location and lighting, it also appeared very safe, even when visited in the early morning or late night hours.</Text>

<text>This place has great service and the best price in the Coachella Valley for covered storage of RVs and trailers.  The location is secure and there are lots of very expensive RVs here so we feel pretty comfortable storing our trailer there!  The only downside is that it is often EXTREMELY windy here so there are actually times when we can't return our rig to its' spot!</text>< Pics>

The only concern we had was lacking of 24 hour patrol on site.
When we checked in, however, we had a rude experiences- the motion sensor was somehow triggered, and we had to bear the very load alarming sound till we leave. We called the office number and got no answer as it's before the office open, We were in at 7:30 am. Hope it will be fixed by the time we go back there.

I had to rent a storage unit to clear out a relatives home after they had been placed in assisted living. After checking out prices I found iStorage to be one of the better priced in the area and was surprised to find it was also one of the nicer ones I visited. The property was clean and we'll maintained and the ladies in the office were very helpful.< /text>

<UserId.>109028284204108876418</UserId.><text>I've had a parking space in the yard since 1999. I'm a long haul trucker so I'm in the yard on a bi monthly basis. The two issues I've had most over the years are:
A. Access to the yard because of problems with gate access I.E. Power failures or gate issues.
B. OTHER TENANTS PARKING THEIR VEHICLES IN MY SPACE WHILE I'M AWAY ON THE ROAD!!!!!!! :{
THE ROWS IN THE OUTDOOR PARKING AREA NEED TO BE REALIGNED, RESTRIPED AND MARKED USING MATERIALS THAT CAN WITH STAND THE ELEMENTS.
Another idea that I've suggested over the years is dedicate  a row or two for SEMI TRACTOR - TRAILER PARKING ONLY!!!! NO RVS NO SMALL TRAILERS OR TRAVEL TRAILERS OR TOY HAULER PARKING IN THAT SECTION!!!!!
LAY A CONCRETE STRIP WITH GROUND SUPPORT FOR WEIGHTS UP TO 80,000 LBS.
MAKE THE CONCRETE STRIP 36" - 42" WIDE FOR THE LENGTH OF THE ROWS. THAT WAY DRIVERS CAN DROP TRAILERS WITHOUT HAVING TO LITTER THE YARD WITH PIECES OF WOOD DEBRIS OR WORRY ABOUT THE TRAILER LEGS SINKING INTO THE SAND. I have had no issues with the office staff over the years. They are always friendly and easy to do business with.

Ive been a customer for 3+ years. It was great until the new owners took over and raised my rent 3 times in 6 months.  Now i pay $89 a month for  a 5x10 unit that is advertised for $60. When i ask about my bill (because there are all kinds of extra charges that i dont understand) no one seems to know what some of the little extras are for.  You would think that they would be a little nice about it when you ask them to explain why you are getting charged all this money and they cant answer, but they arent even nice about it.<//Text>

<text>We moved to desert hot springs two weeks ago.  Knowing we had to return a uhaul truck to this facility we originally rented a 5X15 as we knew we had a few things to store.  After emptying out truck it was clear we needed a 10X10.  They had none so we opted for a 10X15.  The first rental encounter the girl was clearly not service oriented.  Then when we needed new unit the first thing was she transferred another customer.  Advised us it would take 15 minutes to reverse transaction.  Then told us to look at a unit which when we got there had lock on it and was dirty.  So then we finally got the unit.  After asking twice the price we never were told and handed receipts and then told we would have same gate code.  So on December 24th at 3:00 p.m. we tried to get in and gate code denied.  We had two sofas in storage for a family that was being adopted for Christmas.  So no new sofas - felt awful.  Two men were trying to get out other gate and couldn't.  Today I went into the storage to get code problem resolved.  They transposed our gate code so from the get go it didn't work.  I asked for owner's address and was told owners don't talk to anyone.  She would email them.  Asked why other gate didn't work and was told only on weekends can you use that gate.  I was told I should have called her on 24th.  Nowhere does it say in an emergency where to call.  There are paper notices scotched taped to posts about gate hours and you will get locked in if you are late.  There is no service. here.  Now I ready there is a deal for three months.   We were never offered any deal.  I paid January today only to be told I couldn't get a receipt as they were out of printer ink.  Having managed self storages I would assure you I would have been fired over the lack of customer service or concern.  Additionally every time we go out there there is a sign out on property and a number to call and office locked.  How on earth do you service people?</text><Date>1419632029103< /Date>< rating>

<text>I rented spaces for two years, one of my trailers was broken it and someone took the gas and spare tire off my polaris & tools. I went to the offfice they someone would get back to me it took two weeks
and when they called they said I needed to check my units that some one said they were broken into. I'm the one who called.went back to the office they said they look at the vido and would call me back they did not I went back to find out what they found they said the vido did not show my area. I ask what the police said that is when they told me they don't report it. that was up to me this not a good place to store any thing at I took all my things out will not ever go back or send anyone there.

<review>Though I will say Combo #4 stood out to me because of the spice/sauce on the chicken and the buttery rice. Seriously, the rice was a game changer for me. I would just get that as a side if I could. The mac and cheese was delicious but honestly didn't eat too much of it because I was super full from the slider.< /review>< Rate>

<Text>Trust me you won't regret going here. The owners are extremely polite and definitely love what they're serving to their customers. They told me they spent months refining their recipe and even visited Nashville to further the authenticity of their chicken.< /Text>< gmap_id>

I got sliders in x Hot and one of my friends got hers in Blazin. If you love spicy food XHot will be tolerable and yummy but the Blazin taste like straight fire in your mouth. I took one bite and it felt like summer in Arizona in my mouth, and I felt the spicy in my throat too which was not fun, and don't get me wrong I LOVE spicy food, but if you actually want to enjoy your food and have it actually taste like something I'd get the Hot or X hot, you really can't go wrong, they're very tasty!< /review>

<Text>Cool spot. The chicken are prepped and cooked to order. Their sauce compliments the tanginess depending on the level of hot you want on your chicken. Definitely recommend to any foodie lover.<//Text>< pictures>

Bad service I got a special mini sandwich slider for $5.00 dlls they said lose money if they add more onions even if I pay for the onions the combo coming con drink I said you can Keep it and they said the company still lose money for extra onions and the cashier bad actitud. Sorry I try to tasted the different sandwich but not to good for the price and service I prefer Winchels close to them  on Alvarado and Beverly Los Angeles.<//text>

The best vintage shop in the city. Friendly people who will help you find whatever you are looking for, and there is something beautiful in all price ranges. Everything in the store is a quality curated piece ready to wear, no dusty mucky stuff to sift through to find something nice.<//text>

Great place s little pricy but their articles are top notch.   All merchandise is very well cared for or nearly new.  I bought a great stingy fedora beaver fur hat...<//Text>

<text>The lady in the store was kind and helpful, the clothes were beautiful and there were so many different things, the store was clean, and it was generally great. I bought a pretty yellow dress from the 1950's for $150 but it was in almost perfect condition and worth the money. I also saw things going back to the 1920's, so I can say they're not lying about having old things.<//text><time>1594158533067< /time><Resp>None<//Resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

I was blown away by the wonderful selection of not only women's, but also men's, vintage attire. Both Terra and Oran were wonderful! They helped me find some beauties that I would have never thought would fit (and did!) and were overall wonderful. I learned some new vintage clothing facts (I always love learning more about what I am wearing) and found some wonderful items to purchase. I have never been treated as such a priority while in the shop. I wish I lived closer so I could shop there more often. If I'm back in the area, I will definitely be stopping in again!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

It kind of has that musky "vintage" smell but I wouldn't mind that. It adds to the atmosphere of this cute little shop. The second time I visited I found this beautiful dress. I didn't really have an occasion to wear it for but I simply couldn't leave without it. I tried it on and it fitted like a glove. The man was super helpful in zipping it up and good advice. He told me the story behind it and all without being too pushy. It's great to find lovely, one-off beautiful pieces like this!<//review>< Pics>

<text>I went to Relic vintage today and was amazed by the selection of vintage clothing they had. I purchased 3 items and am in love with all of them. I've never been to such a beautiful vintage shop that wasn't extremely expensive or super old lady. Their items are affordable and completely unique. Everything is one of a kind. I went in with a couple of friends and  the workers there started us a fitting room and even brought extra clothes to us that he thought we'd like. We loved all of it. By far my new favorite vintage shop and will 100% be returning.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Relic Vintage is quite literally the store of my dreams; I never knew something so perfect could actually exist until I walked in and saw it all for myself. To start I'd like to say the clothing selection is amazing. Every piece there is desirable and beautiful and made at a high standard that is quite frankly missing in clothing nowadays. I got chills from touching some of the gorgeous pieces. I could definitely spend hours in this store simply marveling at everything. For women there is a generous selection of pieces ranging from beautiful party dresses to irresistible pedal pusher capris. As I was browsing, my mouth agape, I was immediately approached by Oran and he started a dressing room for me. Oran gave me the best service, by far, that I've ever had at a store. I'd find a pair of pants and he'd know just the thing that would go with him. He brought me countless beautiful party dresses to try on and very single one of them fit me perfectly and were something that I loved and would pick out myself. And same for the friend I was with. He appears to have a talent for figuring out people's size and taste in dress without even asking. I wish everyone who worked in stores were like Oran. I will definitely be returning very soon. If you have a chance to go to Relic Vintage, do not pass it up! Everything about this store is unbelievably amazing.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Wonderful, well curated store. The prices are, in my opinion, reasonable and comparable to mid-range, modern ready to wear (~65 for a day dress, ~125 for a cocktail dress, ~175 for an evening gown). When vintage shopping, I tend to spend a lot of time checking how the garment was constructed and confirming that I won't have to invest hours repairing and reinforcing a piece just to make it wearable. Relic's pieces were all in impeccable shape. I will be back.</Text>< date>

Oran is AMAZING! He spent HOURS with me picking out dresses for an upcoming wedding I am attending.  He is thoughtful, patient, and has a great eye for finding flattering dresses for all different body types.  The prices are very reasonable as well. I will definitely be back!<//Text>

<text>This is by far the best vintage shop in the Haight! The clothing selection ranged from the 1970's pants and blouses all the way to vintage 20's ball gowns and swimsuits. Oran greeting both me and a friend and showed us dressing rooms. He gave us a wide selection of beautiful outfits that he knew exactly would go together to try on. You can spend hours in awe trying on fashion of the early and late 20th century for very reasonable prices. I am for sure coming back soon!<//text><gmap_id>0x808587530530a0b1:0x9dcbe9f30e5de167< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I went shopping here for my wedding dress today and was soo impressed by Oran and his customer service. He spent over an hour helping me try on gowns, custom styling me, etc. made me feel very comfortable. i can tell you it was WAY better than any experience I have had in any bridal shops!!! and so much more fun. i am from southern ca and the selection here for vintage bridal was way better than anything i have seen at other stores and very fairly priced! HIGHLY recommend and ask for Oran!! he is the best!<//review>

I was on vacation in San Francisco and was recommended by a friend to visit Relic vintage and decades of fashion. I mainly wear vintage clothing and was excited to find a treasure. After being treated very poorly by staff and owner at decades I was pleasently suprised at the amazing customer service in Relic. The owner and staff were fun, kind, funny and so helpful. I left with one of the most beautiful vintage dresses I have ever purchased. Thank you so much for your incredible clothing and wonderful experience!</Text>

Five stars for the awesome 40s & 50s men's tie selection!Would have grabbed a vintage men's jacket but none had sleeves long enough - constant shopping problem of mine, not the store's fault...

Relic Vintage is unlike any other vintage store that I have ever been to and I am a diehard vintage-enthusiast. The selection is impeccable, curated by the fabulous owner, Oran, who has an eye for top quality vintage and prices his pieces affordably. I think the best part about shopping here is knowing that Oran will take the time to fit you into a perfect look and provide a unique shopping experience. I wish he could be my personal stylist! So many times, I have gone into vintage stores only to feel like I was rummaging at a yard sale and that is NOT the case here. Everything is in really good shape because Oran is a tailor, as well, and can fix any piece! Amazing! In fact, there was one dress I had my eye on but was far too tight, and he was able to transform it to fit me perfectly. I cannot recommend Relic Vintage enough! I tell all of my friends and family to shop here and bring my girls in for a fun time trying on clothes. In fact, Oran fitted out my bridesmaids for my wedding and they all looked AMAZING.<//review>

A real vintage clothing store owned and operated by an SF legend and generally outstanding individual: Oran AKA (OkieOran) Scott

As a greaser,and an oldies dj I have had this exchange a few times over the years. Patron: "Nice costume!" Me: "Thanks, but I'm not in 'costume'. these are my clothes. " Relic Vintage is where you go if you want quality vintage merchandise, that's been hand picked by someone with real style, who lives the life, go see Oran and his crew at vintage.
Tell 'em Heartbreak sent you.

Beautiful selection of mens and womens vintage clothing seeming to range from 30's to 50's which happen to be my favorite and the gentleman who owns it is first class.</Text>

< Review>
customer service is the worst.
they have 0 phone numbers. do not rely on evernote. they will lock you out of your account and make you pay money to setup new one then wont refund so if you want access you have to setup a new account.<//Review>

"Something went wrong on our end, sorry about that. Please try restarting Evernote""  I HAVE TRIED TO RESTART IT BUT IT WILL NOT RESTART.. I EVEN TRY TO RESTART IT, BUT IT WILL NOT RESTART.  I HAVE TO FORCE CLOSE IT ON MY APPLE COMPUTER.  BUT IT STILL KEEPS POPING UP IN MY WAY!!  I NEED YOUR PHONE #...FORGET THIS MESSAGING BACK AND FORTH.. I NEED TO TALK WITH SOMEONE. THANKS...BUT,  I DO LOVE EVERNOTE...I HAVE USED IT A LONG TIME.  THANKS< /Text>

Very disappointing user experience. Bugs with very common use case have existings and known by them for years without fixing. I will NOT recommend this software to any others willing to pay for premium.< /Review>

I’ve tried to cancel my membership multiple years in a row and yet I still get charged every year. I cannot get any one on the phone and submit the support/ help ticket every time. This is ridiculous and a horrible way to conduct business.  Worst customer service ever!!!!!!<//review>

Back in the day EN used to be awesome, now they don't care a stitch about their customers. HORRIBLE customer support. Ive been a paid premium subscriber since 2009, and they ignore my requests for help with their buggy unreliable app. not even a response. time to move on to something else....</review>

They corrected a problem I was having with their service. While I was very frustrated with the difficulty in reaching them (no phone or email is listed). In the end they resolved my issues.</Review>

<resp>None< /resp><review>So many glitches and no contact number for support.  I dont email my issues because it would take me way too long.  Time is money and so is organization of my time, sadly this App that started out as my savior is now my biggest disappointment.  Shouldn't have to stress wondering what will stop working next... edit / spelling glitches, failures to upload,  not recognizing the device the message was created on and locking me into "read only" mode.

Love the app - if it wasn't for customer service I'd give it 5 stars but when problems arise there isn't anyway to contact Evernote except for email. The chat doesn't work and the phone numbers all go to voice mail.< /text>

It is sad that Evernote Corporation hides from its customers and fails to address the many problems with its apps!

They will readily deduct money from your account but they are no where to be found to fix their problem plagued products.<//review>

Love the Evernote app, would love to host a CLSWest event at your facility. Any chance of that, for the 16 or 23rd of June, for about 45 Online Community Managers? Who is your Online Community Manager or managers? For the Trunk, etc.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>December 30th I purchased a premium subscription to EN. Attempting to install I received the bootstrap cpp:956  OX643 error, “unable to find msi package”. After reading for HOURS through forum posts and not able to resolve, I opened a ticket. I sent in my %temp% file. A few days later support had me search my registry for certain strings, all of which pertain to previous installs. The temp file CLEARLY logs the fact the installer looked for the strings in the registry (denoting previous installs) and found none. The installer then fails.
REPEATED dialog with support over this issue has them asking me to do the same thing over, again, and again, and again, like there are expecting different results. The tech told me on each occasion the issue had been escalated. It clearly was not. It is now a full two weeks. Inquiring on the chat the tech tells me he will (get this… escalate my ticket). TWO WEEKS.
Simply unbelievable a software company can still exist with this quality of support. I would expect it from a $15 utility software company. Over the next 5 to 10 years I expect I would have given EN about $700, if you consider price increases, which are inevitable. Add a $500 SnapScan sitting on my desk and I have to wonder if EN intends to stay in business.
Simply unbelievable.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I also discovered that the chat doesn't work, I can't even click on it to open anything up, I had to do a google search to even find a phone number and that it goes to voice mail giving me about 7 instructions to be ready for, all I want is to know if I can recover accidently deleted notes. Yes, or No?<//text>

<Review>I am so disgusted with EVERNOTE! I exceeded my 250 notebook. No warning..read forums, Im not the only 1. I have done everything asked and still not fixed. Premium member and took almost 48 hours for a level 2 to fix it...still not fixed. AND THEY WILL NOT EVEN CHAT WITH ME ONLINE. I CAN CHAT WITH LOWER LEVEL BUT NOT A HIGHER LEVEL.

My business is at risk. Lost Hours already. And appears I will lose all my work that I did since I redid my notebooks! EVERNOTE Please figure this out...

VERY SAD that Evernote can spend money on a new office but not on savvy techs. Im sure I will not hear from anyone at corporate...</Review>< user_id>

We order food for a party of 35 people and the food was amazing! Everyone at the party was very impressed and happy. We ordered party trays of palak paneer, bhindi masala and veg and chicken biryanis. Everything was really delicious and I would highly recommend the restaurant. The manager was also very responsive and helpful with planning quantity and coordinating pickup.<//Review>

Disappointing, especially given the decent reviews! Curry not particularly full flavoured or well textured. Under spiced, under seasoned. Naan, goat curry, and lassi all not up to par. Was a bit of a sad affair. Maybe an off day.</text>

You would think that a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in a strip mall wouldn't have some world-class Indian, Tibetan and Nepalese cuisine for a great price, but you would be wrong. We ordered the dinner for 2 for $40, which included choice of 2 entrees, appetizers and dessert for one price and everything, everything!, was just heavenly. And we were stuffed. A month ago we paid quite a bit more at another new "trendier" Indian restaurant downtown, and while everything there was great too,  Cumin's food was just all about the flavor and technique. Wish I had taken a picture, but I know I will be back soon.<//Review>

Just tried this most excellent restaurant for lunch. Absolutely delicious. Great gracious service, very clean and pleasant atmosphere. Great pricing for lunch and very reasonable for dinner. Lots of plant based options for me and great meat dishes for all others too. I am pleased to have a great Indian restaurant in Santa Rosa. Thank you Cumin for the great new place.<//text>

Liked the size of their Veg Momo. Thicker wrap, which I liked and more stuffing. Veg stuffing could have more vegetables other than mostly cabbage and spinach.< /text>

<review>Waiter/owner (?) was super nice and decor was okay (holdover from the previous Thai restaurant that was there). But I fail to see how the food is getting such raves. The curries were average. There are other places in town with tastier Himalayan-style foods.</review>< pics>

Amazing place with real sweet owners. I eat there around 2-3 times a week. Must try their chicken momo and chicken tikka masala. Love their ambiance and food.< /text>

Great food, reasonable prices. The chicken tikka masala is great. I love that you can specify how spicy you want any dish, and recommend starting with a 2 on their spiciness scale (1 to 5) and working your way up if you like more spice. Beware, the higher levels are quite spicy!< /review>

<text>Very nice Indian restaurant. Chicken vindaloo with very nice and yet manageable heat. My friend had the chicken Tikka Masala. He said it was good if not the best he's ever eaten.
Wait staff was friendly and efficient.
Dining area was pleasantly decorated and clean.< /text></record>

<rate>1</rate><review>I was excited to try this restaurant based on the reviews.  When I entered I was not acknowledged for some time and despite the fact that the restaurant was maybe 10% full, I was finally told they needed to get a table ready.  There were plenty of empty and ready tables.  I waited another 15 minutes, never acknowledged.  So I left and went to Yeti.  Won’t be back.<//review>< Pictures>

Great new addition to the Indian Cuisine offerings  in Sonoma County.  Just across the street from the Flamingo Hotel and coincidently Yeti, another awesome Indian restaurant.  They have a lunch menu with a nice selection of classic dishes, served with Pakoras, Rice and Naan, about $8.99.  Our new lunch favorite!</text>

<text>Finally a good Indian place in town! Their chicken tikka masala is really good. We’ve order lunch specials for pick up only and I wished they did less rice and more of the chicken tikka masala (portion is small) but overall much better than other Indian restaurants in Santa Rosa.</text>< pics>

Decent food. Cleanliness not so great at the dining area. If you are great with apps. I would say it's easier and more convenient to order online for pick up. Just be specific on your order if you want sauces. But they are quick with the food. Hit and miss when you order drive thru.</text>

Don't mean to sound like a Karen but wow, times have changed, I guess, because my Chicken Avocado Burrito literally had two little chunks of chicken and no avocado. The burrito was mostly rice and a few beans ( a very few) . Same story for my daughter. My husband's Double Chicken Avocado Tostada Salad had maybe half a serving of chicken not even what would constitute one full serving.
Used to be a pretty good value for your money but with portions way down ( or missing all together) it's not such a good value.  We've purchased food from this El Pollo for years. For our night out dinner, it was not worth almost $25.<//text>

Horrible experience at this location. I ordered straight from their app and didnt see the option for adding salsa. After I paid for the delivery order, I called them to asked if they could put some salsa in for me when they deliver my food. After several attempts calling the restaurant,  someone finally picked up. I told the girl that i ordered on the app but didnt see the option for adding salsa and if she can br sure to put in my salsa. She told me she cant guarantee that they will remember,  I told her if so, they I prefer to cancel my order since I cant eat without salsa! She told me she will try to make sure they put salsa, I told her please be sure, and if you cant accommodate then let me know n I can cancel my order. Ummm, in the end, I received my order, and of course, theres No Salsa! And my order was wrong too! Ordered 2 corn, 1 Mac n cheese and got the opposite! I tried calling the store to talk to the manager and again, no one picked up! This is extremely BAD BAD service!!! Will not order from this location again!!! Do not recommend it either!!<//review>

The drive thru was horrible today friday the 7th at 7:15 pm of 2021. I waited there to order 45 minutes they should run the drive thru faster is in a tunnel is scary no way out in Case of emergency. So slow. The piece s of chicken so tiny. Please dont go there they have poor custumer service.<//Text>

This El pollo loco never has anything in stocks and you have to literally grab someone's attention as you could be standing at the counter and never be acknowledged. They had no Salsa, No gravy, no splenda.......was just one visit......who does the ordering for this place?< /Text>

< Review>
Unfortunately, I've experienced bad service and rude mannerisms twice now. I hope the establishment work to change their staff's attitude or provide customer service training.

11/23/2020:  In reference to the "owner's" response.  The link provided to give more details would require additional time for this review and there's no clear evidence that the company will follow through.  My general statement for developing your staff's attitude, to be proud of their work,  and providing a higher standard of customer service training should stand on its own on what I believe can help the store improve.<//Review>

Terrible customer service... I noticed several customers returned and complained about their order being wrong, instead of fixing the problem and apologizing the cashier was arguing with them and told them they should have checked their food before leaving the restaurant.</text>

Needless to say  I was to far away at that point...no one answers their phone's !while I was there waiting for my order they got  Domino's Pizza delivered to them at the front counter..🤔wow doesn't say a hole lot for this location on Huntington across from smart and final....😠😡😤</Review>

i recently visited and ordered a $5 combo which was served very quickly. the customer service was great and they gave me the salsa i asked for with no hesitation as we are no longer able to serve ourselves in the lobby. the lobby was actually open here but i chose to eat my food outside on my own. the parking lot is a bit tight and the drive thru line kind of gets in the way if it's busy.<//text>

1 star because other customers/I were in line ready to make purchases w/epl app(corporate headquarters) but were told food offers/deals from epl app(corporate headquarters) don't apply to privately owned franchise store # 3282 ! Rude worker(Gabriela #127) kept on telling me/ others to call corporate headquarters couldn't because my phone battery was going dead. Gabriela let the line back up & stuck to her rhetoric about corporate & refused to let customers use epl app for purchase, I told her if this is your store # 3282 policy why don't  you put a big banner outside that you don't allow customers to use epl app here so epl customers don't waste their hard earned money/time @ store # 3282 ! Frustrating & made all customers mad ! Thanks for nothing !</text>

I ordered street tacos and they were cold as if they had them in the refrigerator. Also did not get a spoon even though I ordered a soup. Makes it difficult to eat on the road</Review>

< review>
Came here during coronavirus pandemic because we hadn’t ate take out in four months ! First thing was the cashier was not wearing their mask properly which is dangerous during this time for them & for the customers . We ordered salads( drive thru) & were missing some of the salads. We called to let them know FOUR TIMES & NO ONE answered. They also forgot the utensils & the most important thing THE SALAD DRESSING !! We had to eat whatever salads we got plain & we noticed the salad tasted odd & realized the lettuce was old & was beginning to spoil. As if that wasn’t bad enough the gravy seemed to be old too as the texture was odd & not like normal gravy. Also our large mashed potatos had a few random orange spots on top ..... which doesn’t make sense at all. Worst experience ever , such disgusting meal & a rip off . Don’t recommended this location to nobody & I will be letting my family & friends know this aswell .  Same your time & money, go somewhere else!</review>

Of all the fast food restaurants El Pollo Loco is my favorite because of their eirchicken. It is so tasty. They have gotten the spicing just right. Their tacos and burritos are the best. We have even ordered their full dinner meals and have been very pleased. I suggest you check it out.<//text>

You can't go wrong with grilled chicken done right. The avocado salsa is very good. Stick to the basics of chicken, beans, rice, and salsa to really enjoy this place. It doesn't hurt that the staff are always friendly and helpful.< /review>

If I could rate this place negative stars I would. I have never had an issue with my credit card, I go the extra mile to ensure my card information is protected. Unfortunately for me I cannot protect my information from the cashier at this fast food place who stole my credit card information on 12/04/2019. If you want el pollo loco go to a different location,  because there's a female cashier working drive through at this place that steals card information and then uses it in Stanton Canyon Country and Monrovia.</Text>

The Service: Very efficient taking orders. Many staffs on duty in the kitchen so the food is prepared quickly.

The Food: Love the chicken, freshly grilled! Super affordable price to feed the family.

The Parking: Private parking lot (free).< /text>

I like their food, but their service needs improvement. I have had the same food given to me in different amounts on different days. Sometimes they rush so much they forget the type of salsa I've requested and they give me a different one.or they don't ask at all. The workers may talk to each other a little more socially than they need to...again, I enjoy the food, it's the service that needs help.</Text>

Watered down guacamole. Visited there several more times and all the sauces mess up the food cause they have gotten worse. Watered down more now. Something needs to be said to the manager. I think it's ridiculous. The cilantro sauce is so watered down you can not taste it. The Duarte store really needs some corporate attention.< /text>

Went here several times and was treated like I was doing the place a favor by buying food from them. I would rather now drive to the next closest el pollo loco just to avoid the rude service. Nothing worse than spending your hard earned money and getting treated like this.</text>

<review>Horrible! Although even after informing them about customized order, they made same original tostada salad. When informed about the incident, they never apologized moreover, just removed stuff that I never wanted and gave me back the same salad tostada.

Inconsistent with portion size verses other locations. Ordered two orders of the 2 piece  chicken combos with  2  side orders with drinks. The pieces of chicken appeared the smallest I have ever bought before , they appeared to be from baby chicks with just a thin layer of chicken.  Had to talk to the manager who admitted this has happeneld all day. Other customers who overheard my complaints mentioned they should of complained as well, earlier. If that wasn't enough the soda dispenser was giving out only carbonated colored soda water and the counter sales person admitted she was aware of this but two other employers were responsible for that and hadn't got around to it yet. After demanding to speak with the manager I over heard two other employees laugh as to how many people had taken their orders out and with todays heat of 104 degrees how funny was that to them, {speaking in spanish} ,assuming  that I didn't understand and assuming I wasn't bi-lingual...When they finally got around to
getting that  corrected the ice dispenser didn't work and the other beverages stopped working. Most offensive was two other employees , whom, referring  to my  light-complexion , they thought it was funny that  I wasn't getting anything I ordered right from them. Their ignorance coupled with poor service forever lost me as a customer por todo mi vida...Discrimination at any level is intolerable....but from my own hispanic brothers and sisters  displays truly raw ignorance and it is their shame as to the lack of education they  fallenshort of and lack of proper management supervison and proper training . By the way... my family was born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico legally immigrated and become proud citizens of the United States, two generations of armed servicemen   and I was a student and graduate of U.C.L.A.  and was a exchange student at the Universidad. De Automa' for 1 year. Enough said.. you get the picture....please boycott this establishment.< /review>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service there is an old woman of white skin short and plump, with a body that did not even bring her name in sight, I asked her and she told me that her name is Maria. A very rude lady to attend, and very disrespectful yelling at her own coworkers .... The fountain of sodas did not taste good and the floor all wet ...

Muy mal servicio hay una mujer ya grande de edad de piel blanca estatura baja y rellenita, de cuerpo q ni siquiera traía su nombre a la vista le pregunté y me dijo q se llama María. Una señora muy grosera para atender,  y muy irrespetuosa gritándole a sus propios compañeros de trabajo .... La fuente de sodas no tenían bien sabor y el piso todo mojado...<//text>
