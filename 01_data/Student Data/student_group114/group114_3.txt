For some reason I always get the best Dentist all my life. And this time with staff that makes me double check the address, to see that I’m not at a beauty pageant in Mexico City! Geez Luisa! What beautiful faces they all have….. I mean teeth!<//review>

Dr. Cheung's office is amazing. From the kind efficient office staff, to his nurses and assistants, to the Dr. himself-- you will not find a better place to undergo oral surgery. Everyone one is personable and thoughtful and calming-- since they all know that no one really enjoys having to go to the oral surgeon!!😳 If the scale was to 10⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️- they deserve them all.</Review>

Dr. Cheung is a fantastic oral surgeon. This was my first oral surgery and he did everything to make me feel as comfortable as possible. He's funny, kind, and knows what he's doing. In fact, everyone who works at this office is incredible! They're really sweet and everyone takes great care of you. I had a great experience here!<//Text>

<review>We just had an appointment for the first time  with Dr. Cheung and his amazing staff! Our son has anxieties and he is never thrilled going to the dentist or even sitting in the chair causes him anxiety. The staff and Dr. Cheung were all so warm and welcoming! We are so thankful that we found such an amazing and magical dentist! Dr. Cheung has a great sense of humor and is wonderful and patient! We are looking forward to our next visit for sure! Thank you again for making our son feel super special and at ease! We are beyond grateful!<//review>< pics>

Dr Cheung and all of the staff were all knowledgeable, professional, and personable. You definitely get the sense that they care about your health and you as a person. They were very efficient, their office was immaculate, and were conscientious about healing and pain management. I definitely felt at ease and safe with Dr. Cheung. He clearly is an expert in the field.

I would trust them with my loved ones and would definitely go back if I needed oral surgery in the future.</Review>

<Review>I was referred to Dr. Cheung for my implants and  my initial appointment found him and his staff very professional and very friendly.
The day of the surgery I was very apprehensive but it was not necessary as the procedure proved not only painless but went quicker than expected. I almost fell asleep due to Dr. Cheug’s expertise and the staff’s attentiveness.
For any procedure needing his expertise, I highly recommend him.</Review>< pictures>

<review>My Daughter needed all four of her wisdom teeth pulled before going off to college, all the local oral surgeons were book and Dr. Cheung office in Calabasas was the only one will to see her before she left. She was so nervous and so was I, but from the first phone conversation with the staff I knew we were in good hands. I love how Dr. Cheung took his time and gave here excellent advice about her soon to be college experience. He as well as the staff was so gentle and they explained everything very thoroughly. I would feel comfortable going to his office anytime. ❤️❤️❤️ Thank you guys for showing us so much love. The drive from Compton Ca was well worth it.🥰<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

I had an Amazing first visit Experience!!!
Truth be told I was petrified of having my tooth removed and how expensive it would be. Dr. Cheung is very friendly and honest (which I appreciate because I had no clue what would happen after having it removed.) and over all him and his team didn’t pressure me into doing something I wasn’t comfortable with. Hopefully I don’t break another tooth but if I do I would gladly come back.< /Review>

<review>I had my first dental implant by Dr. Cheung. Not only does he make you feel comfortable so does his staff. He is thorough, caring and for me, might be the best of the best. You just feel that you are in good hands all the time. As long as you are seen once a year, at no charge, he stands by his work 100%. I NEVER feel rushed in and out for even the shortest visit. I only wish I had the money to do my other two teeth as he would definitely get my business. You can spend less somewhere else, get rushed in and out and never be seen again, or go with an excellent professional like Dr. Cheung who explains everything and makes sure you understand and are comfortable.  When you are lucky enough to find a great oral surgeon like him, you stay with him.<//review></record>

< Review>
The Doctor was fantastic and so compassionate! The office was so clean you could eat off of it. The office was so   beautifully furnished! The assistant was so professional and warm. And the staff was also great! I was scared because this was the first time I was there!
And it was surprisingly enjoying getting my back upper tooth pulled. Dr. Chung put me in a twilight sleep and when it was over I thought it was only 5 minutes but the doctor told me it was 20 minutes. I would recommend this Dr. to my realtives and best friends!</Review>

Staff is super friendly and Dr. Cheung is super chill. My face wasn’t even swollen after my wisdom teeth extraction and I only experienced  minimal pain after surgery. Highly recommend.</Text>

Dr. Cheung is so fun and positive. He immediately made me feel comfortable about my surgery and was lighthearted even throughout the surgery. He is very kind too. He removed two of my teeth in 20 mins! It was fast and painless. He also communicated thoroughly throughout the surgery.

The office was super clean and smelled good, too. They played Italian opera music, which was fun. All the nurses and receptionists were very kind, positive, and communicative. I highly recommend Dr. Cheung.</Text>

I have not seen a dentist in very long time. And it's gonna cost me around 30k. But Dr. Cheung is a stand-up, honest, professional, perfectionist, like Kobe!  He laid out my options, prices, procedures, time frame, which made me comfortable and excited about my mouth makeover.
Then we talked Kobe, and discussed my journey to $3000.00 PER IMPLANT, Thank God for Aquaponics...via Virginia. And let's not forget BEAUTY always calms the nerves, two front office LADIES that sealed the deal with the bill, and no sugar coating. I left the office in Gotta Go Get It Mode!!!
COPIOUS, PROLIFIC,
PROFE$$IONAL$
Can't wait to get pretty smile again...

Wonderful bedside manner as well as an extremely professional office.

I had my 4 wisdoms extracted by Dr. Cheung.  With a nerve running close to one of my wisdoms, and at the age of 46, I was a bit nervous of complications. Dr.Cheung did an excellent job with the extraction. I felt no pain or discomfort during the procedure. Recovery time appears minimal with little swelling or pain. Dr. Cheung personally called that night with a follow-up. His staff made every effort to make sure alls well and I had no concerns or further questions. Highly recommend for oral surgery. Thank you!< /Review>

I give the highest rating to this office. It is friendly, professional, with the utmost regard for safety during Covid 19. Dr Cheung is experienced, and has very positive, calming manner. He provides you with the information you need to make an informed decision. I felt comfortable, even during dental care, and received the highest quality of care. I highly recommend Dr. Cheung, D.M.D., M.D.</Review>

Their team was very attentive and happy when we arrived. They took great care of my husband and even gave us all financial options to make sure we could afford the care. Dr Cheung was very professional and very personable and funny.  Husband was awake and pulled two wisdom and two molars and he says it was painless.  Couple hours after surgery, Dr Cheung called us to follow up and gave great advise to slow down the bleeding. Would recommend to anyone that wants great customer/patient service!!!<//review>

My autistic son is so afraid of any pain! Dr. Cheung was so incredible with him. He met with us before so he could answer all of my son's questions. He has a special way of doing the oral injection that does not hurt. My son had experienced the pain of the needle in a previous tooth extraction, which caused the fear. He was so relieved as he realized the Dr. was injecting him and he had no idea because he could not feel it. What an amazingly simple tooth extraction. Dr. Cheung is a master of oral surgery!< /Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>Everything about my experience with Dr. Cheung and his staff has been top notch. Dr. Cheung is a talented and skillful oral surgeon. I've had a tooth extracted, a bone graft and a dental implant and experienced zero pain during the procedures, minimal pain for a couple of days after the tooth extraction and no pain following the dental implant. He's also got a great personality and makes sure that the patient is comfortable.  If you're in need of an oral surgeon I highly recommend Dr. Cheung and his staff. Also, if you're in need of a dentist I would be remiss if I didn't also give a big shout out to Dr. Kerry Chan. Dr. Chan, my dentist, was there during my implant procedure and truly cares about her patients. She is the best dentist I've ever had and is extremely knowledgeable and intuitive.< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Dr. Cheung is an excellent oral surgeon. It was apparent from the first consultation where he laid out a game plan for a complex all on four  procedure that I was embarking on.  I was naturally nervous and concerned about a variety of issues. He took the time to answer every question and explain every step with great care and sensitivity. On the day of the procedure I was welcomed by his staff as if I was part of the family. Leslie and Zoraida the patient care coordinators who were with me all day were caring and comforting throughout. The procedure was perfect. It’s the next day and I have minimal pain and am absolutely thrilled with the outcome. Way beyond my expectations.  If you are considering Dr. Cheung look no further   you have found your oral surgeon.<//Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Cheung and his office staff were a delight. My 10 yr old daughter came here yesterday for tooth extraction and Dr. Cheung made her feel calm throughout the process. He is the most gentle, funny, and easy going surgeon I have ever encountered with. The office staff were very professional, informative, and they abided by the guidelines for covid. The office looks inviting and very clean. Dr. Cheung himself called me in the evening to check up on my daughter. The office also called this morning to check if we needed anything. These are little things that I truly appreciate especially for a worried parent  like myself . I would definitely use them again in the future .<//text>

<review>I have never had such an easy, kind, and professional dentist visit in my life!
Staff was amazing and friendly and so well equipped to handle my needs and prepare for my procedure
Dr Cheung was so great- he is someone in a short time you would want to be around-witty, funny, gentle, caring and very adept at answering all my questions - and totally honest too about what to expect
I was very nervous and he and the staff made me so comfortable
Their follow up was also great - Dr Cheung called me that evening to check on me and the staff called the next day as well
I would give them a 20 star if I could
And all this is still not enough to give them all the thanks I can< /review><GmapID>0x80c29e8f6fc1ed01:0x4b590f508cccb30</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dr. Tsai and his assistant made the whole experience so much better than I expected. Starting from the consultation, he explained the procedure very clearly. He was gentle, patient, super attentive, and always let me know what to expect the next step during the procedure, which reduced my anxiety greatly. His assistant gave me detailed instructions on dos and donts for recovery and prepared icebags to reduce swelling. They even provided Dr. Tsai's phone number for emergency. Dr. Tsai also called me later to check on me. This is definitely the BEST dental experience I have ever had. The office is clean and staffs are all very nice. Highly recommend!< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Dr. Tsai and Zoraida were incredible during my entire procedure. Zoraida went above and beyond to comfort me during the scarier more painful parts as well as explain the procedure in detail when I was feeling uncomfortable. Though my extractions were not the easiest Dr. Tsai and his staff were patient with me and attentive.<//Text></record>

<Review>Dr. Rennie Cheung and staff provide the best experience you can expect for oral surgery. They truely enjoy what they do and are very energetic.  Zoraida ensured I was comfortable throughout my experience on my last visit. I was nervous but the staff made me feel comfortable and welcome. The surgery went smoothly and was much better than I anticipated. I've previously had bad experiences with dentists and specialists in the past which caused me to develop a fear of dentists and oral surgeons but this team is top notch and will take good care of you. I am so grateful Dr. Cheung was recommended by my dentist, Dr. Kerry Chan. These doctors really do care about your health and are there to address and solve your oral issues. My oral health has improved immensely since working with them these past years. If you need oral surgery (including dental implants), I highly recommend you seek the services of Dr. Cheung and his team.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

This procedure can be known to be extremely uncomfortable and very painful. However, Dr. Cheung clearly knows what he’s doing. He was very gentle! I felt nothing but pressure as he was pulling my wisdom teeth out. I would highly recommend coming here for oral surgery! Zoraida even held my hand to comfort me throughout the procedure! Never have I ever had a professional go out of their way to do that! To put the cherry on top of the cake, the entire place exceeded sanitation standards! VERY clean. Nice and bright inside, but also very private! I was blessed to have such a wonderful experience. FIVE STARS!< /review></record></dataset><record>

Joseline and Zoraida we’re amazing !!! We laughed , the eased my fears and I was ready to do it!! Then Dr. Cheung came into the room !!! He took my tooth out it three seconds and it felt like a massage to my tooth !! No pain !!! It was amazing ... i was in complete shock ! I cannot thank this team enough ! I’m telling my mom and friends to come here if they need any dental work done !</Review>< pictures>

<Text>I've never been one to leave reviews online but I had to share my experience with my visit to Dr. Cheung's office.

To start, when I first called in to make an appointment I was treated very kindly and professionally by Jocelyn. Before calling SCOMSA, I called several other oral surgeons in the area and lot of the other places will just take your info and make an appointment without asking you questions about your current dental health or checking if your visit will be covered by insurance (which is kind of devious). Jocelyn took down all of my info and checked to ensure that my visit would be covered by my insurance and noted my current dental health while giving me the option to come in for a consultation or a consultation straight to surgery. I booked my appointment and came in the following day for my consultation.

Before arriving I called in to let them know I was outside so they could prepare for my visit and ensure that there was proper hygiene in the facility to protect their staff & I from any possible COVID 19 infection. They took my temperature and got me in for X-rays very quickly to ensure I would have a quick consultation. With that said though, there was no rush to get me in & out.

After getting my X-ray, Dr. Cheung greeted me and we got to chatting about what I do and had a great conversation about how we're both interested in Bitcoin. Dr. Cheung went over my X-rays with me and made me feel right at home and explained everything to me regarding my current dental health and the needs for the procedure, mentioning how he has done the same procedure on several of his own kids and would treat me with the same level of respect & kindness throughout my experience. He also informed me of all the risks and possible complications that come with surgery but ensured me of his upmost concern for safety and promised that everything would go safe & smoothly. With that I booked my appointment for my surgery for the following Monday.

The Day of my surgery I was greeted with the same experience for the quick and clean entry into the facility. Immediately I was greeted by Dr. Cheung's assistant for the surgery in which we chatted about the procedure and other things related to my family. Initially I was very nervous but after the chat I felt at ease thanks to the comforting conversations we had before the surgery began. Dr. Cheung then came in with another assistant and ran through the procedure one last time before we began, in which he reassured my confidence in him and his team. We had a quick laugh about talking about Bitcoin and before I knew it, I was quickly anesthetized and came to towards the end of the procedure, to the point where I thought they hadn't done the left side of my mouth and I asked them if they were moving onto the left side as they were finishing the right, but they informed me I was done! As I was getting ready to leave they gave me all of the prescription drugs I would need so I wouldn't have to visit a pharmacy and they gave me all the instructions to properly recover.

It's been 2 days since my surgery and I'm feeling great! My recovery is happening very quickly and I feel some soreness but it's very easy to deal with. After witnessing family & friends endure pain and discomfort for days after their wisdom teeth removals (from other oral surgeons) I was nervous for my recovery, but it has been a breeze. Along with the drugs and instructions, Dr. Cheung also provided a nice headband that holds ice pouches that has really helped with the swelling and discomfort in my face and it's been working wonders.

All & all, if you're looking for a place to get any kind of oral surgery, I highly recommend SCOMSA and Dr. Cheung. Their staff is very friendly and professional and made me feel more than confident in their capabilities.

Fun Fact: Dr. Cheung is a Bitcoin advocate like me, and he is accepting Bitcoin as my form of payment for the surgery!! Not sure there are many other doctors around that accept Bitcoin so this was also super cool!</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<review>My daughter had her 4 wisdom teeth pulled yesterday.  The office was immaculate and very clean.  All the tram were welcoming, and extremely knowledgable and pleasant.  They had already run the proceedure through my insurance and had a clear breakdown of the whole financial aspect as well as my portion.
They also had all medications ready for after the procedure so I didnt have to go anywhere but home, which was greatly appreciated, especially during this Covid 19 time.  Last place I wanted to go was a  local pharmacy or hospital pharmacy!
Zoraida, Christine and Leslie were my daughter's Patient Care Specialists (yes, a whole team took care of us!!) and they were both so wonderful with the knowledge they shared and the way they put us both at ease and answered all our questions.   Dr. Cheung was equally as friendly and informative with a refreshingly positive and welcoming attitude.
The price was fair, the service was excellent.
Dr. Cheung gave us his personal cell phone and said we could call or text any time!  He even called us that evening to check on how my daughter was doing.
I wish he was a regular family dentist as we would be clients for life!  If we ever need any more oral surgeries in our family we will definitely be going to him!
Can't say enough great things about Dr. Cheung and his whole team!.</review>< pictures>

Did not need anesthesia, and it was no pain.
Dr Cheung was very personable, and was quick.
Thank you so much
Gail
Also not a lot of swelling or pain.</Text>

<text>I didn't know that this pizza pub serves the best pizza in the city. Thank goodness my cousin has invited me to this place. He was the one who took me to the pizza pub. The pizza was mouth-watering in this venue. It was very tasty and really satisfying. They were serving the food very quickly. Aside from pizza, there's one thing I like about them. The location itself has been so captivating.< /text>< Time>

Came here with some girlfriends for a simple get together on a weeknight. Menu is pretty straightforward with American classics and breakfast all day. Service was good and more importantly no corkage fee.  Bring your own wine and champagne and they'll bring a bucket to chill it in. So awesome, will definitely be back.<//Review>

Well formed dough that gives a crispy but airy crust that's fine. Ingredients at the first rate make a difference. A good surprise was the fried squash blossoms.< /Text>

Wow that’s good. 1st slice: ‘that is a pretty pizza’. 2nd slice: ‘ exactly how to make a thin crust pizza’.  3rd slice: ‘the pizza doesn’t fall limp when I pick it up’.  4th slice: ‘ I hope something is wrong with this pizza, I’m going to get fat!’ 5th slice: ‘ looks as good as the picture’ (but no red peppers).<//review>

<text>Wow, we didn't know what to eat here because everything looked so good. Our waiter convinced us to try to the KYU experience - only do this if you are absolutely starving or 4 people. While we loved it, it was way way too much food. We left feeling uncomfortably full without eating more than a couple bites of our main entree or the thai rice. They choose all the dishes for you but if you tell your waiter what you are interested in, they likely will hook you up.<//text>< rating>

This place is simply amazing! I love their yummy pizzas and pastas. The ingredients are fresh and their portion sizes are great too. Special mention to the guy who takes orders - super friendly and so helpful. Me and my husband always customize our orders and he ensures that we get exactly what we want :)<//Text>

<username>Ahmad S<//username><Time>1378502875910< /Time><Rate>5<//Rate><Review>never write reviews but this place totally deserves a great 10 star review! Our family called to place an order for pizza and i was put on a hold for a bit...no biggie but the person on the phone was incredible polite and apologized for keeping me on hold. He even threw in a free bottle of soda. Awesome right?

We received the pizza and wings when we were told and enjoyed dinner. Pizza was delicious! Hot, tasty, yummy! About an hour later another person arrives at my front door---totally apologetic and says that they delivered the wrong pizza to us and had a nice fresh new pizza and wings for me. We never even called to complain. They just realized the mistake and took care of it...No charge.

It is so rare to come across a pizza joint/business with unsurpassed customer service, great employees and delicious pizza! We will definitely be ordering pizza from here again..and again...and again.

Thanks Pizza Express...you guys are awesome!< /Review>< pics>

I was looking for a pizza delivery and I came across Pizza Express. After checking their reviews, I decided to give them a chance. I ordered 2 medium pizzas, one with pepperoni, chicken, bell pepper and black olives and one vegetarian for my girlfriend.
The delivery guy was really nice and arrived sooner than expected. Both pizzas were excellent! Mine had the best pepperoni and chicken I have ever tasted on it. The vegetables were fresh tasting and the sauce & crust was perfect. My girlfriend who is very picky when it comes to ordering food said she was very satisfied with her pizza so I am happy to say we have found our new favorite! I can't wait to try their wings next time.< /text>

The only con I would say is that it can be expensive compared to other pizza places in the area but it's worth a try.< /text>< user>

<Review>We like this place owners are great pizza is great but they recently changed their Kens ranch to a house ranch that has no flavor and I noticed they do not wear gloves when touching the cheese or pepperoni which I say is a must so maybe I will not be coming back here after 2 yrs of ordering here.< /Review>< Pics>

Good cheap pizza place in the area.
Staff is very friendly and polite and of course great pizza.
Veggie lovers is my favorite, and you can get it delivered fast.

Just note that this is a very small place if you are looking to dine in and also not a good option if you are with a group.< /review>

Friendly people and very good pizzas (my favorite is the Chicken Spinaci).  This place is mostly geared for take-out so the eating area is rather small.< /review>

Fantastic veggie pizzas and veggie calzones. To me, this is the perfect pizza - nothing fancy, just good, fresh, American-style pizza. Delicious sauce, delicious dough, and great veggie toppings/fillings. Their order online option is super convenient too. Highly recommended!!!< /text>

Super good price! Kept looking  around but made a great choice and went with the King of Sounds! 🤴. CLEAN  INSTALL.. got a nice set of double amps, JBL 12" 1000 Watts, tint, and a DVD screen... loving it. Great job in all service. King of Sound should be your choice!< /text>

I found King Of Sounds on Google and noted it had very good reviews. So I decided to go there for new speakers for my truck. I was impressed with the owner Raffi and the quality of the installation and the price. I came back a week later and had them install a rear view camera that doubles as a front and rear dash cam. The price was less than half what I was quoted elsewhere. I would definitely recommend them.</text>

I discovered this place by randomly using Google search for tinted window service. Ceramic to be specific. Some have said their windows resulted in bubbles days later. Well NOT ME. The majority of reviews were positive so I moved forward. After installation I was told to wait 3 days before rolling my windows down and that I did.  It's going on 2 weeks now and I have no problems. I think I got a good price for both front and rear passenger windows/$200 (labor included). I plan on going back to upgrade my sound system. KUDOS to King of Sounds!</Review>

<review>DISAPPOINTED!  I knew was over paying but figured just get it done professionally as I have already spent a lot on the stuff needing to be installed and too busy to do myself I went on google and found this place.

Which by reading the reviews and seems to be all based on referrals. So I didn’t shop around and left with them and agreed to the price of $700 for all the installation which didn’t think was much as I’ve gutted the inside removed the seats and done more half of the dynomatt already.  And it was supposed to be done tomorrow night.

Tomorrow night comes and had to leave a family function to find out “it’s a lot of work my friend a lot of work” which I replied if you need it another day just say so. Okay tomorrow afternoon it will be done.

I even ordered food and drinks for the crew which they never gotten. Which DoorDash took a photo of all the food and drink left at their doorstep which audio king says they didn’t order anything and the driver took the food and drinks.

I sent the food to check if they where really working on my car that night to find out no body was even there.

Come to find out on the DVR THEY THEMSELVES INSTALLED THAT IT WAS JUST STARTED ON THE DAY I PICKED IT UP!  And look at the pictures I posted.

Was lied and lied and lied too and over paid to have car damaged wreaking of Body Order and seat soaked with another mans sweat is disgusting honestly haven’t checked out the rest of it what they done cause the car smells that bad.

They were supposed to dynomatt the entire car as you can see they didn’t.  So wheres the rest my sheets ($10.00+ EACH sheet btw) and looks like there was only 10 to 15 used when I dropped off a box of 60.

Plus the ones they did use wasn’t even put on right they just slapped it on and there’s air bubbles all over.

SMH  i should’ve went with my gut and went elsewhere imma stop writing more before it triggers my anger.

So yeah avoid this place. Also they didn’t even work on my car until the 4th day I picked it up again they were only supposed to have it for 1 day. And I know this cause the DVR THEY INSTALLED RECORDED IT.  And more which I don’t speak spanish and couldn’t bare to sit in my car to watch due to the sweat and body order the tech left in there.

FML
BUT
FAK!

Disappointing AF and support local business a deserving worthy one. Not a lying things missing items things weren’t done like discussed SMELLY ONE.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Got my car tinted not too long ago and honestly I gotta say I love their work! My family has known the owner for couple of years now and when I asked them where I can get my car tinted locally for a reasonable price they sent me to King of Sounds right away. I’m so happy with the work it was professionally done!!<//Text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

Excellent service and workman ship for installing the backup cameras for my car. Attention to details and prompt service make me very happy. This shop is highly recommended for anyone who needs customized audio and video device on the auto.

Honestly the best place i have ever come. I had a speaker problem and the owner helped me out, i got my sub woofer installed and got my windows tinted. Window tint came with a lifetime warranty. My next project will be to install a touch screen and maybe some jbl speakers. Still deciding on the speakers. They got some cool gadgets to like back up cameras etc. The owners really nice. I highly recommend checking this place out.< /text>

Phenomenal experience all the way around.
Raffi hooked my Nitro up from installing new headlight housing with top of the line LED's and fog lights to my amps and speakers and woffers at exceptional prices!! Professionally done... Everyone there is super nice and no sales pressure and will answer any questions... they have definitely earned a customer for life!!< /Review>

Hands down the best stereo shop in town.. there prices are reasonable and they do really good installations. I brought all 3 of my cars there to get systems put in. Mario, richard are great installers and very patient with any questions that you may have about your install. Rafi is a great guy to work with as well. I'm a customer for life.< /text>

Great and fast service! Went to a different place to upgrade my sound system and I didn’t like it there. Drove by here one day and got a new subwoofer for my car and I love it!

Very nice for someone who don’t know a lot about cars, they took car of me and educated me on what I need to do to get the best sound quality. Thank you guys!<//Review>

I've shopped around and King of Sound gave me the best deal on install of 2 sets of speakers and powered sub! Raffi is a very friendly proprietor and fair businessman.   Mario and crew Juan are great!  They are professional and I would highly recommend them, and definitely call on them again for 2nd sub!</Text>

<Review>Outstanding service. I came in this morning for an alarm install. But not only did I buy the alarm, I also added the dashcam with front and rear cameras, and also a bluetooth radio. The service here is amazing. The staff is very friendly and there was zero sales pressure. Funny how that works, how I kept buying more and more when there's no pressure. I digress. The install they did for all the components was totally professional. It looked like a factory install. Highest quality craftsmanship here. The prices are very fair, which explains why I ended up buying more. The owner, Raffy, is a super cool guy. He made sure I was happy with my purchase and was taken care of. I'll be bringing him my other car for a new alarm and dashcam. And I'll be telling all my friends about Raffy. I give King of Sounds the highest recommendation.< /Review><Rating>5<//Rating><GmapID>0x80c32873669a6559:0x618db7f6f0bceed1</GmapID><user>113459770323964700875<//user>< time>

I came in to find out why the screen went black on my 2013 Camaro. They took it apart to see what the problem was. They spent about a half an hour and it turned out to be a loose wire. Raffi would not let me give him anything for the time. He just asked me to recommend him to my friends. Done! I was blown away what great service!< /review>

<Review>This place is by far the best place you can go to for all your stereo needs. The owner Raffi is very very polite HONEST and will do his best to make sure you leave happy. My experience speaking I bought amps speakers and a box. I am a business owner myself so i look at businesses a little different then most people  do. I look at the sales pitch the answers to my questions. I trying to see if I'm going to hear BUll***T azz lines. Raffi is a good business owner and I left with all confidence in my purchases peace of mind. He was nice enough  to go above and beyond for me adding LOTS OF EXTRAS at no additional cost. I won't say what they were but it was a nice gesture. Thank you Guys for the great service and will work on my other car soon.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c32873669a6559:0x618db7f6f0bceed1</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend this shop to anyone who wants to upgrade on sound systems lights etc. Man.. Unbeatable service...  I took my truck to a different location around here and got screwed. Speakers went out the first week due to bad installation, the technician here knows what he's doing and the owner Raffi made sure the job got done right and even covered my warranty even though I didn't purchase the system here. You earn my loyalty and will definitely bring my 2nd vehicle here for upgrades. I will recommend this shop to my buddies and colleagues. Thank you.</text>

Best place to get your stereo work, subwoofers and even car wraps and l.e.d.s done. Rafi put in my friends subwoofer and amp and wired it all amazingly. Also Mario helped save my subwoofer I accidently blew a coil on. Still bumping the single coil! Thank you guys at King Of Sounds!!!< /text>

I’ve been working here with Thomas and Iris for more than a year, it is definitely the best opportunity I’ve ever had in my life. Not only the money you can make here but the accomplishment you could achieve is always unlimited. We are making our life better by helping working families to get protected at the same time. We work, learn, support one another and develop together. There are always negatives and positives in everything we do but we start and end with the same family we were in the beginning. Tough times never last, but tough people do. This opportunity allows you to expand out of your comfort zone with the safe feeling of having a support system behind your back at all times.</text>

Thank you Cheyenne Miller reaching out me for the final expense topic. As a 30 years medical field professional, I know how important it is, but, didn't realize we need to prepare that early. Cheyenne showed me her presentation, very professional and confident. She explained everything simple and easy understanding. Timely follow up and very organized. She is so sweet and I love her smiling face when she's talking. Good job, Cheyenne!<//Review>

This career is a blessing and a opportunity to grow every second, every minute, every day to either learn or develop something new or even to improve. This opportunity includes a strong hearted, open minded, very supportive, and positive environment. This company being and acting as a family is definitely an understatement, every person supports and genuinely cares about one another to push themselves and changes their lives. I can truly say I love my career and the people I get to be surrounded by every single day. Not only did my life change as soon as I stepped foot in the door to meet Thomas and Iris, but the lives of people I love the most changed. This opportunity allows me to change my life to make it the way I have always dreamed of, as well as take care of my family later on in the future. I can sincerely thank every single person I work with that helped me and impacted my life to guide me in the right path to become the person they know and I know I can be. I am extremely proud to say that I am grateful to call this company my family and my career.</text><Resp>{'time': 1625785698111, 'text': "Cheyenne, we're glad to hear that you are satisfied with your recent experience.

<Review>I started working with Thomas and Iris back in 2019 and let me just start off by saying, I can’t see myself working anywhere else. From the moment they took me under their wing they have been nothing but supportive. My life has definitely changed for the better after starting my career here. They’ve helped me through so much that i can say they genuinely care about others. They thrive on seeing people succeed and inspire us want more out of life. If you’re looking for a positive workplace where you can unleash your full potential, this agency is it!</Review>< Pictures>

Phoebe He was extremely helpful and very courteous.  She was very personable and really made me feel very comfortable and explained all of the benefits very clearly and in detail in a way that I could easily understand.  I believe these benefits are a great resource especially the cancer coverage and the freedom of choice benefits.  The coverage for my children is very beneficial as well.  Thank you Phoebe for all of your help!<//Review>

I was always nervous to get life insurance because I’m Hispanic and if some people know Hispanics are very superstitious especially when it comes to life insurance or anything that has to do with losing someone or talking about death in general. But I know it was already time to get it. I just been procrastinating on getting it. Especially how things are going these days you never know. I was helped by Maria. She’s very professional, very knowledgeable answered all my questions polite and very friendly and helpful. If there’s any good time to get life insurance is now. I truly recommend this company, give them a call, talk to them, asked them questions, you’ll be glad you did I know I am. 😊👍</review>

I have to give a round of applause for Alyssa Miller. She really has me feeling comfortable and In the right hands. Very knowledgeable with insurance information, touched all aspects in and out of any questions I had and the best part she actually took the time to chat with me and get to know me a lil bit as well as get to know her before starting any business. I don’t know about everyone else but most people just call and ask for money but when someone like Alyssa Miller takes the time and real initiative to build that bond with a conversation on a personal level it shows the dedication to clients that  it’s not just the money but to truly make sure people are covered and insured when any situation can happen.

i’ve worked here for 6 months and this company has brought nothing but blessings to me. the closer you get to this team the more opportunities get brought to you! in the very few time that i’ve been here the opportunity has been endless! crazy how 6 months ago, i would’ve never imagined having such a great experience at any work enviroment. “if you don’t give back the same energy to everyone and your environment, how do you except to receive?”<//review>

Ive worked here for about 6 months and i have nothing but love for iris saavedra and Thomas longino. They have helped me and developed me so much. All businesses have their ups and downs but the positives outweigh the negatives drastically. I have so much more to say but I don’t know how to word it so ill just leave it at this. This agency is #1 in our category.</text>

Giselle Hernandez was an enourmous help in getting my family and I a new policy. I had no clue where to begin and she broke it down for me all while being so helpful and kind! She was professional, informative, and patient with me while giving me my options and benefits for each plan. She took her time to make sure I understood, and was comfortable, with my policy. I recommend Giselle to anyone that wants friendly, efficient, and helpful service!!</review>

<text>Christian Kies was nothing but helpful , personable ,  and had great customer service . He made it easy to understand all of my options and I didn’t feel pressure to do anytbing that I wasn’t fully aware of . He made it easy and I felt heard and felt comfortable that he wouldn’t screw me over . So if your Christians boss reading this review I want to let you know that Christian is great at what he does and he does do stuff to help your company . Christian is an asset and it would be a shame to ever let him go</text>< pics>

<Review>Phoebe He was very informative and professional. She genuinely cares about her clients and gave good information about the policies. She was transparent in what AIL offered and gave me a number of quotes based on what I want to fit my budget.</Review>< name>

There’s a lot of opportunity when it comes to working here. You can make any kind of income you want depending on how much work you choose to put in. Working hourly jobs, going to college following the basic path to “success” is what I was previously doing only to be promised a mediocre wage with a mediocre lifestyle. Then I met Thomas Longino and Iris Saavedra. They provided me with the guidance to navigate the reality of life with success. A lot of people where I’m from don’t aspire to anything more than mediocrity. But Thomas and Iris showed me it’s possible to reach any goal if you work for it. As people who’ve already succeeded, their mentorship is worth more than any paycheck. This office is unparalleled in work ethic, fun atmosphere, and reward!!!< /review>

Never thought I’d have such a great experience when I picked up the phone, but when I did I’m glad Allisa Crisostomo was on the other end. We had a great time conversing and she did a great job taking my family and myself through every single step. She broke everything down and answered every question I had with no games. She was very respectful and professional all while keeping it fun to go through the process. Allisa was very honest and thorough about everything she brought up. She helped put things to perspective and it was very eye-opening. Over all I don’t think anyone really looks forward to having life-insurance conversations but after talking to Allisa I’m very glad we did! Now my family and I can sleep well knowing that we’re all covered and all of my family members will receive the proper treatment when it’s our time to go.<//review>

<Review>The true hidden gem of Sacramento
Thomas Longino & Iris Saavedra have absolutely changed my life for the better.  The culture of the office is unmatched.  They spread nothing but positivity and happiness to all employees and make it a very enjoyable place to work. I highly recommend taking a look at the office if you're looking for a career change. The socialization aspect: from policyholders to co-workers there is never a boring day at the Saavedra-Longino Agency. In short, we get paid to drive, talk, and help educate people on how to be protect high value assets. The whole office family gets invited to BBQ's, family functions, and many other cool events in the greater Sacramento area. It is impossible to work at American Income: Saavedra-Longino and not develop a strong social network as a result of working here! The staff is like a huge, wild family. Everyone has a different story, background and why. I wish I came here straight after college . From Day 1 the training & mentorship is unmatched. You know you've found your calling when you love what you do and it's no longer work.  Looking back the only regret I have is not finding this place earlier.

Thank you, Thomas and Iris< /Review>< Pictures>

<text>Great experience! I sent in a certificate from my union for some insurance and I got a call to talk about it and ended up buying more insurance from them since the representative Alexandria Miranda told me the insurance I had was only term and I got whole life for me and my family. She was very friendly and even talked to me about fishing and had a couple conversations while we were dealing with the documents instead of just sticking to the script and selling me just insurance so I felt comfortable.</text>< Response>

Noe Perez was a great professional Representative from A.I.L. He explained all of the areas in great detail for me to fully understand and to give me more in site for future decisions I can make later on. He was very friendly, willing to help and answer any questions. His presentation was perfectly introduced, as well as highlighting the key points.</Text>

<Review>I've worked here for about a year in a half, so I've seen many things here. First I'll start with the positives, you can make an abundance of money based of pure work and dedication. However, the negatives are much larger. As a regular agent for the most part you wouldn't have problems other than getting pushed to work harder. Once you get into management you will need to deal with manipulation tactics by Thomas Longino and Iris Saavedra, as well as deal with egos that create a childish workplace with no structure led by the owners of this agency . The insurance industry naturally have a high turnover rate but, with this agency it's a reason why most of the agents have not been there for a year or more. Don't let these people lie to you and say the care about your success, especially when they control your leads ! I made a lot of money at this company but if you do not want to be in a toxic work environment with no LOYALTY then keep looking else where.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< rating>

Longino is an agent for American Income Life Insurance Co.  So why wasn't I told that when they emailed me for an interview?  Why did I stand outside of their suite, which is in a very nice building, wondering why it didn't say Longino? It said American Income Life for suite 350. Why was I told the job is offering benefits to union and credit union members.  Why wasn't I told the job is 100% commission? The one answer to those questions is YOU PROBABLY WOULDN'T ACCEPT THE INTERVIEW OPPORTUNITY.  This is a scam to get you to become a Life Insurance Agent. You have to pay for the pre-course, the state exam and the licensing, which is several hundred dollars, all before you receive a dime in compensation. If they have to present what I consider deceptive information to get me to come to what I was told was going to be an interview with the Regional Manager, then how can I believe anything they tell me after that?  Sure you can sell to union & credit union members but you will be selling to everyone that is over 18, has a pulse and wants Life Insurance. Your an agent.</Review>

< Review>
Back in December of 2018 myself and husband signed up for life insurance. Agent was really nice and came across as knowledgeable. The only thing about the agent that felt high pressure was he stated the offer was only good at that moment once he left the home the offer was not valid. I should of known something was up by not allowing us time for decision or research. Today we are at the end of March and I have only received my accident policy information and a letter stating my life insurance could not be approved because medical records requested have not been provided by Dr and or hospital. I have 4 charges and 2 refunds for random amounts on my account and no explanation of what I’m currently being charged for. I have not got an approval or denial for my husband. I currently have no idea what coverage if any we have except for my accident coverage and no idea what the charges or refunds are for. I have reached out a few times with no agent response. It would be nice knowing what if any coverage we have and what the charges and refunds apply to. So frustrating ......do we look else where for coverage or keep letting random unknown amounts be charged and refunded for coverage I have no policy or information on anything but my accident policy. My husband feels it’s some sort of scam and today he requested the auto pay be removed till we are made aware of our benefits if any the cost of each benefit and the due date.< /Review>

Good company for people involved on the business of living.  They have policies that pay living benefits so people don't go broke because of an illness or accident.  The people are friendly and helpful and truly care about the people the serve.< /review>

Therapydia is one of the best physical therapy offices I’ve been to ever.
They are so very organized, so welcoming and friendly, and very professional.
My primary therapist was Courtney. She is such a smart, kind, thoughtful and professional therapist.  I recommend her very highly!  She was able to key right into my issues and show me many useful exercises to ease my pain and help me progress as needed.
All of the therapists there are outstanding and very well qualified!
I highly recommend Therapydia for treatment of any physical issues.
I am very grateful that I was referred there by my orthopedic surgeon.  Ask for Courtney or any therapist there.  You won’t be disappointed!

<review>I have had many different experiences throughout the last ten years at physical therapy offices trying to rehab my knee surgeries, arthritis, neck problems, knee replacement and finally recent back surgery.  Therapydia is the FIRST “physical therapy” office that has understood the needs of the patient being foremost in rehabilitation of the person’s life.  I have knee, lumbar and mobility pain that seemed unknown to all of the other “professionals”.  My therapists, Richard and Jason, have understood the needs and review how to actually relieve the pain when it occurs.  This has NEVER been possible in any other therapeutic setting. They are the most knowledgeable and approach the plan with kindness and patience.  I am so grateful that I have found Therapydia Saratoga PT. The front desk with Aron and Tron are welcoming and so accessible.  This is an incredible and professional office.  I recommend it wholeheartedly.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1623333387228, 'text': 'Sharon, thank you for sharing your wonderful experience with us!'}</Resp>< rating>

Jason is great to work with, I’m very pleased with the amount of progress I’ve made working with him for one month. It’s great to see the measurements/numbers behind the progress, too. I’m glad that he’s taking a full body approach to helping me reach my personal activity goals. I look forward to working more with him in the future beyond my surgery rehab.<//Review>

My sessions were all during the height of the COVID pandemic.  My therapist Courtney was always punctual, prepared, and professional.
She made regular notes of my progress and communicated them to my surgeon. I highly recommend this site to anyone seeking physical therapy.< /review>

I have just graduated from an outstanding experience with Courtney at Therapydia. The facility is clean and inviting, the people are friendly and helpful , and Courtney offers the very best in PT. She is constantly assessing and adjusting and has the patience of a saint in trying to teach me why and what to do once I am on my own. Strong recommendation.<//review>

Christina is super patient and helpful with our treatment. She is very communicative and we have "homework" to work on after the session so the treatment continues at home. She is also very friendly and easy-going. She will ask throughout the treatment how you are feeling. In addition, Aaron at the front desk is very welcoming and helpful. The place is clean and the team is very friendly. I would recommend this facility to others. We always look forward to coming here< /Review>

"Courtney, Christina and Lauren have all been amazing. I have spent most of my time with Courtney and have nothing but positive feedback. She is always prepared with a plan and always clearly articulates her plan, the reasons for her plan as well as detailed instructions for exercises. She has gone above and beyond to improve my shoulder and I feel that she is genuinely invested in my progress and healing. I also experienced Courtney as a student teacher. She was a great teacher and allowed her student to actively participate in my therapy while observing his progress and engaging him in dialogue. I can't say enough about Courtney and the rest of the staff"</text>

< Review>
I never thought much about getting physical therapy. Through broken bones, torn tendons and muscles, and major hip and foot surgeries, I never considered actually getting the recommended therapy. But when my repaired foot wasn't allowing me to walk normally, I went to Therapydia on the recommendation of my doctor.
I could not be more surprised at how their knowledge of the body led to appropriate exercises, stretching and conditioning to bring my gait back to normal. It is great stuff and I highly recommend this group.<//Review>

Christina, Robert, and Aaron at Therapydia have all been just Super-fantastic to team up with regarding working and planning activities which BEST work for each individual according to their specific needs and limitations.  Love how the staff all have such a calming and friendly environment for the clients.  Also, appreciate the cleanliness, and COVID preparedness as one enters the facility.  Would recommend this facility especially Christina easy to work with, shares her knowledge and and expertise related to the anatomy of your personal situations. Again, would highly recommend if challenged in areas of your physical body give Therapydia a try its been therapeutic a source of healing from the inside out, thanks Therapydia!!!!Clients are given the tools necessary to maintain a good balance and to live longer, stronger, healthier lifestyles......
Hats off to all of the staff such a friendly environment keep up the good work!!!!!!😊</text>

Therapydia is the best! Robert is so knowledgeable. He takes his time to explain and then customizes exercises that he closely monitors. He has been very helpful in treating my many injuries. I highly recommend him and I’ve found that everyone in his office has been pretty wonderful.</Text>

Therapydia staff have been totally committed to my successful rehab following rotator cuff surgery.  They are friendly, encouraging, patient, and yet firm with what I need to do (and not do).  I particularly like the fact that they do not spend a lot of time having me do exercises on site but rather teach me the exercises, record them on my phone, and then send me home to perform the daily exercises.  This makes me more invested in my own recovery.< /text>

<text>Our family of three are with Robert L. for more than eleven years now. Each time he fixes things in record amount of time. Whatever the problem is, after the therapy, I always feel like having a new limb. The exercises are easy to follow. The instructions are simple. Specially, the in clinic therapy that Robert provides is to the point. Their great reminder system. front desk service with Aaron are added bonus. Thank you, Therapydia.<//text><Gmap_id>0x808fb5a557263617:0xf063e0515fd18250</Gmap_id>< Response>

I chose Therapydia because Robert Lucente is amazing. He knows what he is doing, which I cannot say for many PTs. I’m an active person and have had several injuries that required PT to avoid surgery. Robert has helped me escape the knife before and I have every confidence he will again this time. He knows his anatomy well and is more than willing to explain Exactly what he is doing, in easy to understand terms, show images to clarify, and explain why an exercise works. He is a stickler for correct form and sends me home with video instructions for me to repeat the exercises correctly at home. He is very available via email to answer questions after I have left the office. He is my 1st choice PT guy, unquestionably!!!!!!!<//review>

You will be positively blown away at how different TherapyDia PT is from the others you’ve gone to.  My experiences at the 6 other PT places I’ve visited in San Jose-Saratoga-Santa Clara over the last 20 years were all the same:  10 minutes with the PT, 30 minutes exercising with a PT Assistant then 15 minutes of ice/stim.

At TherapyDia, you spend your ENTIRE appointment with your Physical Therapist — there are no PT Assistants.  Instead of 20 PTs in a huge room, there are just 4 PTs in the Saratoga location.  After your initial diagnosis, I urge you to vary your appointments with each of the other 3 therapists because each one brings their own gift of education and healing.

A special call-out to Aaron Garcia, the Office Manager who answered my first phone call. He balances super-duper customer-facing professionalism with warmth and attention to detail.<//text>

This is absolutely the best place to go for PT. Robert and his team of physiotherapists are exceptional. They are outstanding professionals who are genuinely caring and focused on getting results. Very nice set up, excellent customer service and great treatment. I can't believe the progress I have made in just a few weeks!</Text>

<text>I could barely walk without limping and it was painful (it used to feel like a fresh wound). I stopped hiking, biking, scooting. Team at Therapydia had been very helpful, starting from addressing the problem, understanding the situation, listing the exercises, correcting my postures, scheduling (and re-scheduling) sessions, follow up, finally treating the problem. I am very happy that recently I was able to hike (or walk) 10 miles without any significant pain that I used to have 6 months ago and now I bike at least 5 miles everyday and its a great relief. Thank you team Therapydia.< /text>< user>

<review>I went to Therapydia at my Doctor’s recommendation after a shoulder injury.  I am still in therapy and so far it has been an amazing experience. My therapist Courtney has a very holistic approach to how she addresses the issue. She talked about the root cause of the issue as to why injury may have occurred in the first place and is helping address that.  It is a long road for me to get to 100% but I have made significant progress already. Would recommend Therapydia to anyone looking for Physical Therapy.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Therapydia provides excellent service. My therapist, Robert, is extremely knowledgeable and thoroughly understands my problems and how to treat them. He spends time manipulating my problem areas to help with my pain and increase mobility before getting into my exercises each session. He also answers my questions clearly to ensure I understand the why's and how's behind everything. The Office Manager, Aaron, is also awesome! He's always very friendly and takes great care of my billing and scheduling needs!< /text>

Robert is expert physical Therapist. I was in pain from my back to side of my leg and  first 6 weeks with very little improvement, continued with Therapy . I was reluctant but kept on going.  Today I am 99.9%. Continue to exercise what he has given. Hope to see 100%. Roberts knowledge of anatomy, muscle group is exellent. I wish him all the success to his Therapy clinic.

All the staff are very courteous, friendly and follow all the protocol of COVID 19.  This place is absolutely safe and clean.</review>

<Review>My initial evaluation by Robert was spot on and matched the MRI I had subsequently. The entire experience from front office to therapist is top notch with an excellent therapy plan.

Final review:  staff friendly and caring. No matter which therapist works with you, they are all informed of your treatment plan and the quality is the same. COVID-19 protocol taken very seriously. Treatment effective and I like that I gave videos of exercises to use as a lifetime practice.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Therapydia is top notch. My assessment was incredibly accurate before my mri & X-ray was done. My mri & X-ray confirmed what Robert assessed it to be. 2 other doctors didn’t think the damage was very severe until they saw my mri & X-ray. Then they agreed with Robert’s initial  assessment   He then designed a specific program to help with my shoulder problem. He was upfront about what therapy could do & couldn’t do. I highly recommend them without hesitation to anyone. Outstanding service, knowledge & treatment< /Text>

I needed PT and was tired of going to large PT mills where the therapists were employees, and not that engaged.  At a large business, and after one of my therapists spent most of her time looking in the mirror at her hair, a decided to leave that establishment and never return.

So I searched for a better alternative.  I wanted to find a small, boutique shop with therapists who were connected with their patients.

Therapydia Saratoga is just such a place.  I have been working with Christina, who is a talented and caring therapist. I have made great strides in healing and I couldn’t be more satisfied.

My PT, Christina has an amazing talent to diagnose and injury and determine an effective course of treatment. I can't tell you how much she has helped me."

This is my PT care team going forward.< /review>

Four of our five family members have been to see Robert for back or knee issues, and each time we have found him to be knowledgeable, thorough, and compassionate. I'm not sure my son would be back on the field without him! I have recommended Therapydia to several friends, and will continue to do so without hesitation.<//Text>

<Text>Robert is the best Physical Therapist I have ever had and I’ve been to my fair share of them. He has such a positive outlook on life and is a genuinely good person. He doesn’t just care about doing his job, he truly cares about each person who comes in Therapydia. I have been to Robert off and on through several incredibly hard foot surgeries for the past few years and he has been there cheering me on and encouraging me all along the way. I have never once felt pushed aside by him. He is an excellent therapist that will work with you at your level. He has had a ton of experience throughout the years and really takes the time to understand your situation and help you in any way he can. He has listened to concerns and questions I’ve had over the years and has always helped me feel more at ease and motivated me to keep going. He goes above and beyond what is required as a Physical Therapist. I will forever be grateful for all the help and support I’ve had and continue to have from him.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Robert is the man! I've been having shoulder/back issues since I graduated from high school. I've tried chiropractors, massage therapists, my own internet investigation, and many other paths with little relief. It wasn't until I saw Robert that the underlying issue was properly diagnosed. Through a combination of muscle work, stretching, and customized exercises, we were able to get ahead of the issue and correct itself. I can now continue my workouts and free my muscles up for an enjoyable quality of life.

The new facility is absolutely awesome too. The tables and workout tools are all new and top of the line. The front desk is super friendly and easily works through insurance and any questions as well. I truly enjoy my visits!

Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a Physical Therapist!< /Text>< Pics>

Robert has been a really amazing therapist, he has not only helped the process of recovering from ankle surgery and learning to walk again, but also has helped motivate and support the emotional challenges of rebuilding your strength. I would strongly recommend going to Therapydia in Saratoga if you have Physical Therapy needs. Also shoutout to Aaron who always finds a way to fit you into the schedule no matter how packed it is!!<//text>

<review>Best recommendation someone could have ever given me. I have been working with Rob for the past 4.5 months getting me back to normal from my ACL surgery.  Operationally, they have made things very smooth dealing with my insurance and giving me the flexibility to work around my work schedule to come in.  Aaron at the front has been great making it all happen and it is always great to chat with him before my sessions.

The facility is clean and large space with alot of great equipment to do a variety of exercises.

As for Rob and his wealth of knowledge in the variety of exercises and understanding of his patients has helped me towards becoming mobile again. It also is great that he explains each exercise and how the body and muscles work so I have a better understanding moving forward to exercise correctly.  I wish I knew a lot of this stuff while I was in school or playing competitively. I also like that he helps me understand the exercises by demonstrating them clearly as well as video records them so I can work on them at home.

Over the past 4.5 months he really helped me get that feeling of being active again.  His ability to push me to the limits in a motivating way I feel has accelerated my path to recovery.

I have referred my surgeon to use him because of the success I have seen since working with him and his team. I would urge more people to reach out and work with a team that is inviting, educating, and overall cares about each individual patient and their success.

Thank you Rob and Aaron for the opportunity to work with you both on my path to recovery.< /review><user>107763940850787712242< /user>< Gmap_id>

I was recommended to Therapydia by my doctor after having a compound fracture on my left wrist/forearm. This was my first experience with physical therapy, so I didn't really know what to expect. I was not disappointed.

Aaron at the front desk was courteous and diligent through email, phone call, and in person contact. He always made sure that appointments fit my schedule, and put the extra effort in to be personable and friendly.

Robert was awesome. He was knowledgeable and professional, and very passionate about his work. I never felt lost when he was explaining terms or going through at-home exercises. After every appointment, Robert would update me on my progress and make sure I was in line with my goals.

I highly recommend Therapydia Saratoga to anyone in need of physical therapy/recovery from injury.<//text>

I came in with groin pain that had not changed in 5 weeks despite any self help that I tried. Shanice diagnosed of my problem and got me on the path to recovery. The exercises she prescribed, in the facility and at home, have dramatically diminished the pain I was feeling. I'm sure I will be all well very soon. And she is a super nice person. Also, Aaron, at the front desk really takes care of everything, from scheduling to billing, making everything very easy for the customer. He too is a very nice person. I would recommend Therapydia to anyone who needs physical therapy.</text>

Can’t say enough positive things about Robert and the team!
Aaron at the front was great with scheduling and was extremely personable which made the experience that much better. If I ever needed to make an appointment he would always try and accommodate my schedule and has an extremely positive attitude!
Now on to my injury. I hurt my neck somehow and had been getting really intense headaches everyday. I came to Robert feeling a bit defeated about my situation since it had been a few months. Robert took the time to really understand my situation and it made me already feel like it was going to get better. He uses a lot of techniques to help your injury and tries to find the root cause rather than just fixing the ailment. I also worked with Shanice and Enok and was impressed by their skills as well.
Since coming to Therapydia my headaches have been much much more manageable and am able to live a normal life again. If I was still in the area I would absolutely go back to Robert and would recommend him and the team for any injury.
Thanks again guys!</text>

I also have a long-term back problem that hasn't responded well to PT in the past.  My back really flared up and I was researching people in the area and found Therapydia and Robert.  Wow, he is the first medical person that has made a real difference in my back pain and flexibility in 20 years.  I like that he runs the entire session with you and doesn't just turn it over to a PTA.  He has had some extended training that is very specific to sports injuries which also relates well to back and joint problems.  Robert is a young guy that is highly recommended by local orthopedic doctors.  This is his clinic and he is highly motivated and very professional</Text>< Pics>

I went to Therapydia with three different issues-back, hip and foot. I worked with Shanice who really worked hard during our time together working on all my problems. She was wonderful and gave me tips and exercises to do at home to keep my progress moving forward. Therapydia is new and a great place to seek out for physical therapy. I would recommend Therapydia to family and friends.
Thanks Therapydia and Shanice!<//Text>

I've tried several physical therapy clinics prior to Therapydia.
At those clinics, about 90 percent of my time were spent with a PT assistant whose job is to connect me to one (ultrasound therapy or massage) machine after another.  It was ineffective.

At Therapydia, Dr. Robert Lucente actually spend time working with me 1:1 analyzing and providing treatments for my issues.  There are no massage machines, no PT assistants, and I always feel better and well cared for after each visit.

I found Dr. Robert Lucente to be very knowledgeable, and very professional.  I feel he truly wants to help, and truly wants to see me get better.  I had a chance to work with Shanice once, and she is also very knowledgeable and good.
Aaron who works at the front desk manages the appointments among other things.  He is very nice, helpful, and super efficient.

I highly recommend this clinic.<//Review>< pics>

< review>
Shanice at Therapydia is one of the best physical therapists that I've had.   She consistently identifies problem areas and reduces the muscle strain and works on the soft tissue so that affected areas can recover quickly.  After complications after a shoulder surgery, she identified issues with the functioning of the collarbone, as well as various issues with 5 of the shoulder muscles, explaining it all along the way.   While addressing the problem areas in the physical therapy sessions,  she consistently increases and modifies home exercises to steadily strengthen the muscles without overstraining them.  Since seeing her, the complicated shoulder joint has significantly recovered.   I highly recommend her.</review>

<Text>Son, age 12, had sport injury: fractured ankle one one ankle and then sprained the other ankle. Was in wheelchair for months with two casts. Robert Lucente, physical therapist, with strong speciality with sports injuries, began work with my son as he transitioned to boots then graduated him to regular shoes. Son is still continuing care as he builds strength and endurance. Also, to build muscle to prevent any future ankle injuries.  This is very important to my son as he is very athletic and interested in many sports at competitive level.  The office is friendly, inviting, and professional. The sun-bright, airy, simple, post-modern design style helps you feel at ease and comfortable. We like the music playing that is soft-sounding great old 90s-80s-70s blend that keeps mode upbeat and positive.  The open style patient-tables with equipment organized for maximum open space makes for a positive experience and is non-intimidating to my child.  The initial setup with health insurance coverage and making appointments was simple and smooth due to the hard work of Aaron Garcia, the office manager.  The expertise of Robert Lucente and his staff, including Enoch, made healing for my athletic son seamless, hopeful, and enjoyable.  Developing exercises that incorporate “playing” with a ball to encourage fun while also working towards ankle strength and balance made “therapy” fun. Great conversations and high-fives also made physical therapy time fun. Overall, a very positive and healing experience for my son’s sport injury.  We highly recommend physical therapy services at Therapydia with Robert Lucente and his staff!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1563907067634, 'text': 'Hi MamaMama, thank you for your awesome review!'}< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808fb5a557263617:0xf063e0515fd18250< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Shanice is a cut above the rest. I went to many other physical therapist for an old sports injury before I found her. I thought I’d have to live with the limitations of my injury for the rest of my life. Then Shanice figured out that it was actually a nerve issue: not a muscle one.

After sticking to the regimen Shanice set up for me, I rarely feel my injury anymore and am on the path to picking up where I left off with my athletics. It is a true blessing and I am thankful I found her.< /Review>

I had a guarded opinion of PT as my experience has been mixed, and often made my pain worse. But given my gymnast daughter’s positive experience with Shanice, I wanted her as my therapist when my need for PT arose (“tennis” elbow resulting from pickleball, and now IT band syndrome). Shanice is truly exceptional - the most knowledgeable, helpful, and personable PT I’ve ever had.<//Text>

It was really pleasant to work with Shanice and after 6 weeks of treatment and rehab sessions, I feel more confident to get back to running (I will do it slowly Shanice!) comparing to self-treatment through google search which I have done several times.</review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Great therapy sessions with strategic and targeted excersises. Friendly support staff from the start, all the way to the therapist. Convenient new patient forms online at initial contact. I was impressed by the expedient intake and follow up about insurance coverage. My Therapist, Robert, works with you the entire session which is so nice to have the full attention the entire appointment. And actually reads your intake information prior to your first appointment. Able to assess your PT needs and develop a treatment plan customized to your ability. Robert explains medical jargon with good analogies to normal-people-speak. My time is valuable and he treats you with the same respectful attitude. My appointments ran on time. Robert only gives timely “homework” that is useful and helpful to your healing plan. I immediately felt relieved of pain and saw results from treatment for my knee surgery right away. Office has tech-use to send you text reminders for appointments. This is so much better than the phone calls for me so this is a nice option. Aaron at the reception desk greets kindly with a smile and helps to set the mood of the environment calm, peaceful, and happy. Robert is always friendly and his care is consistent in quality and effectiveness. I appreciate the fact that you can trust his care and attention for you is full and time spent is for the entire session. Compared to other places when you see assistants or spend time on ice and not get individual attention for more than ten minutes; here at Therapydia you have the attention of your PT the entire time of your appointment. This specialized and high attention contributes to the success of your treatment. They truly know your progress and able to encourage you to further healing Also, the tips and excersies seem customized and good “mashup” of utilizing more than just the one target spot like my one knee. Robert explains with ease and demonstrates clearly every routine and my knee, along with all the support muscles like glut, thigh, feet, back, etc are all getting efficient work out during each session and important to the overall sustaining goof mobility even after the initial healing of the knee. The office is decorated in a clean organized modern but warm style. There is plenty of parking and windows allow for beautiful natural lighting all day.< /review>< Pics>

I had a pretty bad spill on my rollerblades and ended up coming here for some stitches. I'm new to the area and didn't know what to expect from this office, but I couldn't be happier! Dr. Jain stitched me up on a Friday shortly before closing and did a great job! It has been just a few weeks since I got the stitches out now, and the scar is already looking great! (especially considering it is on my face!) I'm grateful I ended up here.</review>

I checked in online & only had a brief wait before being put in an exam room. The nurse & doctor  whom I saw were both efficient & professional. The doctor took the time to listen as I explained my symptoms, do the appropriate testing & ultimately give me test results & reassurance.
I would go back to CareNow if needed.<//text>

I have had good results with CareNow in the past when I suffered nerve damage from a bad hit to my leg.  I thought I'd try CareNow again for a Covid-19 test since they did not require an appointment.

I drove to the location and there was no one in the lobby.  I think -"great I beat the rush".  Then I talked with "China" at the front desk and was told the wait was 5 hours and that they would call me when I could come back and take the test -and to fill out the paperwork now to speed up the testing.  When I read the paperwork, it was clear that they were going to try to bill my insurance for a full office visit ($200 if no insurance)  rather than simply a Covid-19 test.  This is clearly CareNow's way to bill my insurance provider for more money than a simple Covid-19 test -which is un-needed.  Further, the office took 7 hours to call me AND the test results could take up to 12 days.  Not happy.<//text>

I came in for the coronavirus rapid testing as required by my nursing school. I was attended to by two medical assistants, a lab technician, and a physician. The staff was efficient, proficient, and delivered amazing rapid care. I really appreciated the services provided by their staff. They have an amazing team at this location.<//Text>

I went early in the morning and there was only a short wait, for which the nurse apologized profusely. She was very friendly and knowledgeable. Dr Alex was also friendly and shared his experience of also having eye irritation. He also made sure to get me a prescription to a Safeway pharmacy, since I live in Southern California and typically use a Vons. I hope I don’t have occasion to use Care Now again, but if I do I would feel very comfortable in doing so.< /Text><user_name>Dillon Phillips< /user_name>< rating>

To the team:
Seemed a little disorganized in terms of time management. I think realistically there was a lot of miscommunication from the staff, which caused them to over-communicate to me or need me to re-state a lot of things. Ideally if there were fewer staff members to interact with me as an individual, there could be a better distribution of people taking in foot traffic. Given I was in for a COVID test I don’t think I needed to speak with a nurse, and two doctors. Otherwise Melinda and Denise was very nice and efficient.

To clients:
In the case that you’re coming to get anything done, prepare to hangout for a bit. I was lucky I brought a book, but sadly I was late to two lectures because of the 2 hour wait :/. I can’t say it’s unbelievable, because there is a small team and they’re trying their best to keep up, but obviously in an ideal situation, when you’re in at 3:15 for a 3:30 appointment, you don’t have to wait until 5:23 to be seen.< /review>

Super friendly and was able to get same day results for covid tests within 15 minutes.    They open at 8 and was in line by 7am.   I was seen by 9am and had results by 10am.  Highly recommend if you want same day results but you’ll need to come early to stand in line before they open.</Text>

Everything inside of the clinic went well. All the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Waiting time however needed to be improved. I was in line 30 minutes after the clinic opened, though I  was informed that the time to wait was an hour and a half, ended up leaving the premises after 5 hours with 30 minutes being attended.< /review>

I called this urgent care location to set up Covid testing for me and family . I have Blue Cross Blue shield and my employer plan covers 100% including urgent care.  However, front desk receptionist said she does not know that and have to charge per person.  After giving her a phone # to call to confirm, she said it is not her responsibility, it is the billing department. When asked to talk to billing , she said they are gone for the day.  12:30pm on a Thursday..no billing person working??  Probably the worst customer experience given Covid times, they should have their act together by now and be more customer focused.  If i could give a negative score ..I would. NO empathy.<//review>

Staff here are super friendly and helpful! This was my first time doing covid testing and I was feeling a little nervous about the procedure.  But everyone was very informative and answered all my questions! Would 100 percent recommend this place!<//Review>

This place is called a covid testing center, but buyer beware: you need to do a doctor’s visit.  This means they will hold you there unnecessarily for at least an hour.  I guess there’s a minimum time to bill your insurance company for a visit.<//Text>

<Review>I arrived with 3 people ahead of me.  I filled out all the paperwork, turned it in and set down.  About 20 minutes later, there are now 10 people in the waiting area, no one is at the front desk.  After 20 plus minutes, I decide to call to find out what is going on, no one answers. I notice others start calling, no one answers.  At this point there are about 15 people in this urgent care facility and no one at the front desk. Finally, a patient exits from the medical area and someone else is called. I as 4th in line to be seen, for blood work only.  I was there over 2.5 hours. If I could have gotten my doctor’s orders back, I would have gone somewhere else. But with the missing up front staff, I as stuck.  All the staff were pleasant, but no acknowledgement for the horrendous wait time.< /Review><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<review>Registered online so I didn't have to wait there for my turn. They call you and tell you when to come in. Still waited 45 mins in the waiting room before they took me back to get tested. Was there for a total of 1 hour and 20 mins to get a rapid Covid test.< /review>< pictures>

I went for mi Covid test today. The lady in the front desk is constantly taking off her mask, touching her face and mouth all the time and after that she's giving the paperwork to be filled by patients, taking your credit card etc...She just put back her mask when a patient get close to the counter.  That's UN ACCEPTABLE  in a COVID test facility.<//text>

Went for a Covid test - smooth and good experience. The check in was quick, and efficient. Filled in the paperwork (I skipped the whole web process as there seems to be a disconnect with carenow.com on all physical sites).
I was told to go home as it takes a while and that I'll receive a call.
Got a call within two hours and they're ready and I gave my ETA.
Went in, within minutes went to a room, had a vital check, consult (they were all super friendly and very informative about Covid). Got a rapid test (nasal swab was not bad at all - just a tickle). In less than 15 mins I had my results (negative)!<//Review>

Few days ago I was seen at this urgent care. The employees are friendly, working very officiant with patients while pandemic. Facility is clean and they making sure the waiting area is not over floated with too many patients. They’ll have you fill out the form and let you wait in car until it’s your turn, you will inform via phone.
I would like to mention DR. Jai, she is professional, knowledgeable, friendly.< /review>

<Gmap_id>0x808e35c6a876cba3:0x5c4d6aaa6160735c</Gmap_id><Review>BELIEVE THE BAD REVIEWS.  I have only come here for covid testing so I am not sure how their other services are. We got here before 8 am and waited in line along with many others. The nurse came out at 8:30, counted us off, and said they only had the time and tests for the first 25 of us which we were in. After that, I waited with my boyfriend in line for FOUR hours without hearing anything. It took an average of 20-25 minutes per person once it was their turn. We all were becoming very frustrated, but we all remained there in line. At 12:00, the receptionist came out with clipboards and had us fill out all of our information. This was told to us as registration, so we could leave and they would call us when they were ready. I asked her if she knew a ballpark of how long that might be. She told me 45min-1 hour. I said “oh? Just another hour? Okay we will wait here since we drove from Santa Cruz....” we fell for it and we waited another HOUR AND A HALF. They had the same poor couple in the waiting room still that they had when they started the clipboard process. The receptionist just kept saying they would call us when they were ready and to go Christmas shopping while waiting so we finally left. (YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO GO OUT AND ABOUT WHILE WAITING RESULTS OR WAITING TO BE TESTED THATS HOW IT PREADS) We went back to Santa Cruz and waited by our phones. We waited another THREE hours and then we finally called. She answered after 6 calls and said “we are doing our best and trying to get to everyone” so then I asked “wait. So you may not even see us today?” Silence...”excuse me? You may not see us today?” “Yes, correct. We will try but we are taking walk ins and online appointments as well” so I said “this is incredibly poor communication. I understand you may not see everyone but that should have been told to us hours ago. You should not have told us 25 people that you would. There was a pregnant woman coughing in line and several elderly people. They deserve to have clear communication. That’s so disappointing coming from our medical workers” and she just said “we will keep trying” and hung up. Well...we called again at 7 and she said they were on patient 11....so we never went. Places like this terrify me because this discourages many people who SHOULD REALLY be tested from getting tested. Do not waste your time, they still have too much to figure out.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>1</Rate><Response>None< /Response>< Time>

The facility was clean and there was ample room to socially distance.  The people were pleasant, professional and efficient.  Several clients waited in their cars and the staff was very accommodating to them.  The doctor did a good job of explaining the procedure and what I should expect.

Although I had done an online checkin I still had to fill out about 3+ pages of forms and each of those three pages asked for essentially the same information.< /review>

<review>Well it's not really an urgent care. I came to them in the morning feeling very sick and with fever, they had a line outside. After an hour the receptionist in a rude form told me they are booked up and don't take walks in. Not sure why this placed even advertises it self ad an urgent care. Classical los Gatos office with a bad attitude that you need an appointment for or come half an hour before opening. Maybe the doctor will decided to take you in that day 🤔< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

I got an appointment to take a Covid-19 Antibody test. after 1.5 hour of waiting, I gave up and left. 30 min later, they called me and I went back, this time after 40 min wait, they took me to a room, and told me I still need to wait to visit their doctor, before drawing my blood. And I disagreed and left.

Do not waste your time with them.< /review><UserId.>117299503535772827682< /UserId.><time>1603766842031<//time>< user_name>

Ridiculous wait time. Appear to admit whoever’s making the most complaints. If there’s A/C it must not be working because it’s swelteringly hot. Poorly staffed. One party literally left because nobody was at the front counter to check out. Worst urgent care experience I’ve ever had.< /Text>

We called this place 3 times to confirm the testing procedure and were told to come in at 8am due to a usual wait for testing. After sitting in line for 6 hours she was finally seen and they were going to bill her insurance for a office visit or $200 if she had no insurance rather than a simple Covid-19 test, which they also hadn't mentioned after I had called to confirm that it was free testing. They are obviously taking advantage of the pandemic for charging for testing. Do not waste your time here it's a Covid scam.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< rate>

I needed an Urgent Care on a Saturday and had new insurance coverage. CareNow was on the list. I was not looking forward to the visit as most Urgent Care clinics are old and inefficient. Well, I was pleasantly surprised....this place is new and clean. AND, the staff looked like they not only knew their jobs but also liked their jobs! What a wonderful surprise! They also got me in and out fairly quickly, diagnosing me properly. Thank you CareNow :)< /Review>

<Text>I’ve been there twice. First time, no complaints. Second visit was to treat an injury on the weekend, and was let down. my primary care was shocked by how incomplete the doctor’s notes were and how little care or guidance they provided. The x/rays they gave me were also unreadable and useless on a follow up visit with a specialist. So-so.< /Text><username>Alex McGregor< /username><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808e35c6a876cba3:0x5c4d6aaa6160735c</gmapID>< Pictures>

<Review>My appointment for Covid test was at 1pm and was not called over an hour. I kindly asked the receptionist how long it will take and she said "oh, you were not called yet? Just be patient" MY TOTAL WAITING TIME WAS OVER 2 HOURS.
I got tested at 3:10pm and I don't think the nurse did a right procedure for my test. She didn't swap deep inside my nasal cavity , she barely touched the inside of my nostrils.
If you want to get accurate result for your test, don't go there. You will be wasting your time and money.
Ps) Your covid test copay will be waived by your insurance but they will charge you an office visit fee. FYI</Review>< Pics>

<Text>DONT COME FOR COVID TESTING!

Read the reviews cause they are true how bad this place is.
I needed a test and I go in at 5:50pm when they say online they are open until 8pm and you can read the issues and rudeness below.

1) Problem 1: Their phone line doesn’t get you to front desk (or they ignore)
I call the front desk waiting outside to be mindful of the front desk lady inside, and the person looks down and doesn’t pick up the phone. I give benefit of doubt and consider that the line I was calling doesn’t actually go to the staff at front desk but somewhere in the back.

2) Problem 2: Rudeness of front desk + Their hours are lies for COVID testing (hint they don’t have hours)

Kim was who I talked with and maybe she was having a bad day. But she rolls her eyes and doesn’t acknowledge me until I go up to her and ask if I can get tested. She said you would have to book online for anything after 8pm.

Huh? I was there before 6pm and it wasn’t 8pm. So I ask her what she meant cause it was before 6. She repeated the same thing that you can’t get tested after 8pm and to book online.

She doesn’t give me the website when she suggests to book online. I look around, at the front desk and I didn’t find a website. Kim starts cleaning her desk when I ask her when I can get tested if I book online. She says that she doesn’t know and that the office will try their best to schedule an appointment. I start going to the website now and then I ask if she knows of any place that can get tested sooner. Kim responds curtly asking if I knew what Google was and I can search there. Woah woah, that was very condescending to me.

We don’t stop there.  I ask Kim for what are the hours of testing at this UrgentCare site. She says that the office will do their best to book me in. I clarify by asking what hours in the day they conduct the tests. She doesn’t answer and says the same thing. I ask if there are spots tomorrow that she can check thinking that her responses are weird. She says she doesn’t have access and NO WAY OF CHECKING! I’m astounded at this point.

I ask her for the website and she gives a sigh and rudely responds back with the url with a tone like I’m dumb.

I leave and fill out the form and I will actually not come here for testing. You have better luck going to Santa Clara website for those testing locations.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808e35c6a876cba3:0x5c4d6aaa6160735c< /GmapID></record>

I have never had to use Urgent Care before and with COVID-19 I wanted to chose a place that looked clean and would give me a low risk of contracting the virus. This place is located next to the Acura LG dealership which is where I purchased my car and get my car serviced so I was very familiar with the area and felt comfortable going to this location.

My first impression was when I called the center to see if they accepted my insurance. I let the receptionist know that it was my first time using urgent care and that I was unfamiliar with the process. She was nice and understanding and assured me that there was no wait. When I finally got there the center was extremely clean and looked newly remodeled. There was also no one else there which helped me feel safer and know that I was going to be helped ASAP. They were extremely quick with service. I was in and out and within 45 minutes. This was great because I usually get wait a minimum of 15 minutes (with an appointment) and then an additional 15 minutes in the room to see my primary care physician.

Awful experience, no appointments so you have to get really lucky walking in. Staff don’t appear to care if you don’t get seen or helped, I was definitely made to feel like a number not a person.< /text>

I was very impressed by this urgent care. It is impeccably clean, wonderful front desk and customer service, very short wait time and not crowded whatsoever, little paperwork to fill out, with nice coffee and tea while you wait. Once seated, each room has its own TV where a movie is playing (from the beginning) for you to watch. The doctor came in and was incredibly attentive, ran a few tests, and had me out with a prescription within 15 minutes. I highly recommend this place!<//Review>

<Text>Maybe I have an unrealistic expectation of service, but I reserved a spot online. I was called and was told to come in an hour and a half later. I show up as directed and wait for another 75 minutes before being told it will probably be another 45 minutes.

<review>This place is a nightmare.  They told me they would call me in 4-5 hours to come get the test.  23 hours later they call.  As the phone rang only three times I couldn’t get to it before they hung up.  They left no message.  Tried calling back multiple times, no answer.  So I drive down there and tell them I missed their call,  they said they’ll call me in 2 hours.  I told the lady behind the counter the story and she said ok come back at 1:30...  Now I get there at 1:20 and there is no one waiting to be tested.  15 minutes later I get asked to go into the testing room.  A technician then starts asking about my medical history and I ask multiple questions.  Then she want to take my blood oxygen level and blood pressure...  I came for a Covid test not a physical exam.  Then another lady comes in and starts asking the same questions.  I told her that I was there for a covid19 test only.  She says it’s company policy to ask all the questions.  Again, all I needed was a test not an exam.  I got up and left.  This place is a train wreck don’t go there for anything.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

The room you wait in to see the doctor is so empty . Seems like no one works there . It would be nice to have disinfectant spray in the room to spray after each person through this pandemic. I waited 2 hours to be seen after I was given a 30 minute notice for my appointment. They don’t schedule strategically so that only a certain amount of people can be in the lobby . Instead they have ten people waiting for hours to be called in next . I felt like I left with COVID because I was in a tight room with so many people .< /review>

<resp>None< /resp><review>I have been on the wait list since July 18th for a covid test.  Online they ask that if you have symptoms to check in online and they will let you know when to come in. I signed up online and received a text stating they will be in touch to let me know when I can come in. Well that ship has sailed and I finally got to my Dr to get a antibody test. Its tough to chase things down yourself when your fever is high and your suffering but thanks for letting me fall through the cracks somehow. Got trapped in some kind of Covid nite-mare, you cant go to the hospital for a test unless you have preexisting conditions and are basically dying. Cant go to the pop up testing sites if you have symptoms.  My Dr could only get access to antibody testing. So what are we supposed to do ? This urgent care is literally the only Covid testing place in our area. Just another case missed I guess. No wonder America is failing miserably at this testing and I am not the only one who has had this experience here in San Jose.</review>< time>

I had a COVID 19 test here for a job requirement, the place is clean, the staff is friendly and the doctor who gave me the test was swift, quick and gentle, barely felt it. She was great, I really appreciated it, since so many people complain about how painful the test is, yet mine was quick, easy and painless.</text>

Went in back in March for an earache.  The service was good, staff was friendly, but all they really did was look in my ears and nose.  No co-pay at the time, and for months I didn't get a bill so I figured insurance covered it.  Nine months later, I get a bill for over $200..!!!  Apparently my insurance didn't cover ANY of the costs.  And why so expensive for what they did, or rather didn't, do...?  Recommend asking for a price list before going in.</text>

Not much to say. I was there for a pre-employment physical which took about 10 minutes. The doctor seemed very nice.  Office was clean, and I only had to wait a few minutes. It’s fairly close to 85 so would be convenient if you live in the area.< /review>

I filled out papers before I went in and registered online to get in the queue. After I arrived I waited OVER an hour and a half for the test. Once I was called from the waiting room the person said she needed to get my weight, height, temp (ok), oxygen reading, and then went through a standard form of questions - did I smoke? drink alcohol? medications? medical conditions? .... WHAT relevance did any of this have to do with my request for a Covid test? It was a WASTE of my time, and doing all of this for everyone else that was there for a Covid test is unnecessarily contributing to a huge backlog. Not an efficient process by any means. Frustrated? Yes, definitely!
Additionally, when I had waited almost an hour and a half and complained, the receptionist suggested that I might like to drive (from Los Gatos) to Milpitas for a shorter wait time (turns out I was the next person called in from the waiting room). What a crazy suggestion to at that time drive all the way from Los Gatos to Milpitas to get the test. Someone wasn't thinking very clearly!</text>< Name>

Went in for a drug screening for my work place. Gave them my paper work, filled out some forms, waited roughly 5 minutes, and I was in. Everything went without a problem and instructions were clear. I recommend this place for quickness, attentiveness, and the lobby has a TV with working audio in case you have to bring people with you.<//review>

<review>I went in on a Monday afternoon with flu symptoms because I felt a bronchial cough for  several days, was running a fever, and my overall symptoms were not improving after five days. The staff were very friendly and the wait was not long thankfully, but the doctor was really not helpful. He barely listened to my breathing even though I had mentioned having  history of pneumonia and now a persistent cough. He did not test for flu, as he argued it would not make a difference in my course of treatment after 5 days of symptoms, and instead prescribed an expensive inhaler that insurance doesnt really cover. I felt the doctor also judged and disapproved of me even coming in for my symptoms.
Overall, the office was nice and clean, they even had complimentary tea and coffee, and service was timely, but the medical treatment for my particular case was not helpful or effective.</review></record>

From an easy check in procedure, to a preliminary check of my history and condition, to the final test, my COVID test was easy, efficient, and painless.

I was treated with kindness, respect, courtesy, and professionism.< /Text>

Their service is terible! We went in, around 11 AM, for COVID19 test. The lady at the counter told us that we should go home and she will call us around 2 to set us up for 4  o'clock appointment. She never called. Before leaving we asked her if there was any cost for the test since we had Kaiser. She said there was none.  We took it upon ourselves to go back around 4. We got there at 4:35. There was different lady at the counter and she told us that we can be tested at that time. We sat there for ONE HOUR before she called us. At that time she told us that since we have Kaiser, we could potentialy be charged $400 for the test!!. This was disclosed to us after we had waited for a whole hour!! When we told her that the lady in the morning had told us there was no charge, she just shrugged it off!  I would not go back there!!<//review>

<text>The doctor Kyaw Min MD was super.
He actually took a few minutes to ask about the medication I take and why I think I need it. He explained the procedure of the pre op covid test and we laughed afterwards because i was surprised that my nasal canal was so long , it "felt like" I sniffed ammonia for a quick second.
The girls in the front typed up the paperwork quickly and were very nice and very calm, they all said have a good day when I left, like it was my birthday.
I would recommend going to CareNow on blossom hill Los Gatos,
where everyone working there
gives "You the attention" you need.
Be safe - stay healthy - I'm pleased

Care Now is my go to urgent care for my family!
Dr. Jain and her staff were amazing! They were friendly, knowledgeable and I didn’t feel rushed like other urgent care places that I’ve been to before.     Dr. Jain took her time and was very thorough.  The facility was spotless! I didn’t have to wait long and maybe my timing was right.. who knows but I will definitely be coming back!</Text>

I was welcomed by the front staff and nurse on duty and the facility was quite beautiful and I thought to myself, maybe I should make this my new faculty to go too as it’s so clean and it opens early. I found out that looks aren’t always the best impression. I came in with a pretty bad headache and was hoping to get good care. All my information was taken and I mentioned a couple medicines that have worked for me in the past not really knowing that maybe those might not really actually help me. After talking with the Dr. I was told they didn’t have the authority to write the script for the medicine they would write but could for another. 1 single pill to help my horrible migraine. I suggested that maybe they call another location to see if they could authorize and that Dr. said they didn’t think the strong medication would help my headache. I walked to the front and paid my copay and the faces on the staff looked silent. Nothing was done for me and I informed them I would be going to the hospital. I am glad I did as I was given IV with fluids and Tylenol to help with my migraine. I received a follow up call the next day from a staff member if I picked up my prescription and did it help. Remember it was 1 single pill. Little did he know that the pharmacy sent back the prescription because it was only 1 pill and they don’t do prescriptions for 1 pill and the pharmacy was still waiting for response. I went to the pharmacy and asked them to please fill the 1 pill to see if it worked for my continued headache and they asked “are you sure” we are still waiting for a response and haven’t received one. I said well the Dr. sent it, so will you please fill it so I can see how I feel after. Luckily they did finally but the facility failed to call back me and the pharmacy because they could not get ahold of the original doctor who wrote up the prescription. So my theory is don’t judge a book by its cover it’s what you get through the process. I wish the original facility could have educated me on what really would have helped my migraine and I wouldn’t have had to go to the ER. Sadly I will not be returning and I will not recommend.</Text>

<Review>Was extremely impressed with CareNow! The facility is new & gorgeous and the staff blew me away. They were extremely professional, provided great service and followed up with me days after my appointment. I had a limited wait and was taken care of quickly. This is going to be our new Urgent Care in the local area because of their great bedside manner! Overall great find and not like other Urgent Cares in the area.< /Review>< pics>

< review>
My wife used the services and was quite pleased with the experience. I came down with a terrible cough, she insisted I go there now. I was interviewed and the basic information was taken down by a very courteous aide, then I met with the Dr. she was very through, more than I expected from a walk in. She told me she didn't like the sound of one of my lungs and said an x-ray was in order. The x-ray tech was great and as with the Doctor she explained what she was doing, this only took a few minutes. Immediately the x-rays were read by the doctor and she prescribed  what I needed. She went over the x-ray and pointed to the area of concern and handed me a written narrative of what she observed and how I needed to take the medicine. The experience of about 35 minutes was very professional, this includes a very pleasant front desk person. I highly recommend.< /review>

Love the ability to book online! They were thorough and very responsive. I was about to book, arrive, complete strep test and leave with a prescription in less than 1 hr. The first urgent care I stopped at had more than a 3 hr wait. I will certainly be returning for any future needs. One downside is that they are out of my insurance Network so I had to pay 50%. But I was so sick I didn't care.<//Review>

Their IT system was down. I did a web check-in and they kept calling me the "web check-in" at the office. They sent my prescription to the wrong pharmacy. I called in after my visit because my insurance needed info from their doctor in order to authorize what they prescribed and the Latina who picked up was not helpful at all, sounded tired and grumpy, didn't try to help move the process along and just said the pharmacy has to call them, doesn't offer to call the pharmacy for me so I had to go do it myself. It was medication I really needed ASAP too.<//text>< Time>

Yes this maybe a convenient place to go to when your primary is not available but I felt it didn't not meet my needs. The doctor didnt care to order an xray when I felt my symptoms warranted one.  SHE said we dont like to give radiation here but the hospitals do.  WT?</text>

It's a clean modern office. Staff polite, effecient and knowledgable. Wait time was great, very quick especially compared to ER room. Both Dr.s I've seen were kind understanding g, knowledgable, and took the time to answer all of my questions and concerns. Love the convenience of this place too.< /Text>

I came in the clinic Wednesday with a high fever and sore throat.  I was brought back to a room within 5min.  The staff were amazing.  Devila, Nathan, Nicole, and Dr. Raja did a great job addressing my needs and making me feel comfortable.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Talk about a WOW Wednesday.  This place has earned my loyalty and trust.  I will recommend CareNow to all my family and friends.  Best Urgent Care I've been to.<//Text>

< Review>
Stay far away. Worst experience in my life. No reason to risk your health here.
Questionable ethics in taking care of patients and a total lack of a caring/sympathetic attitude.
Horrible insurance management.
More expensive than alternatives.
More unnecessary paperwork than alternatives.
Only good thing is that the place looks new, but that's hardly enough to outweigh the negatives.< /Review>

<review>I have been through my share of Urgent Care facilities in my life time; this is far and away the best I have used.

You walk in and it's clean.  The staff is extremely professional.  You don't need to fill it pages and pages of paperwork.

Then, you are seen immediately by a highly qualified doctor.

They have everything on site to diagnose so you don't need to go to another facility or another floor to get everything done.

The first time I went, I was in and out in 46 minutes.  When I was there this last Sunday, I was out in a little over an hour...and that visit included and x-ray and a reading by a radiologist.

The location is great as well.  In Los Gatos right off of 17 and on Los Gatos Blvd (next to Pier 1 and Chipotle).

If you need care, this is the place to go<//review>< pics>

I've been using this storage spot about a year now and I absolutely love it! The location is situated in the safe area of Costa Mesa and the facility provides every need of your storage shopping. Compared to the other competing storages, it surely offers the best rate with promo. And the best thing about this facility is the staff, especially Leo. He's hands down the most polite, friendly person who's willing to go above and beyond. From the initial tour to actual move-in, the process was seamless and stress-free because of Leo and his fellow staff. Many thanks!<//Review>

<text>I recommend this location! We reserved our unit ahead of time, but upon arrival realized we needed a larger unit. Leo was great about walking us through to view options, explain the costs and helped us settle in. The location is convenient and easy to access as well. The move-in was easy and we felt our stuff was safe and securely stored. Thank you Leo and Allspace!<//text>< resp>

I've had my loot at Allspace Storage for about 10 years now, since I down -sized my living space.  I've felt like my beloved items are secure because it's such a nice, professional and receptive storage company. Leo has always been so kind and easy to work with. Everyone there is always easy to reach, and ready to help with anything I've ever needed. I had bad experiences in the past, so it's nice to be worry free.< /Text>

I love this place, the staff is what put this place a part, besides the location.
I rented a place here for a couple months, but I have been here for over 8 months.
I recommend this place with my eyes close.<//review>

After walking through MULTIPLE storage facilities in the area, Allspace was the only one that both smelled and looked clean, had great incentives and prices, and had an amazingly helpful and friendly staff!  All of their storage units are very easy to get in and out of.  Communication is great!  Leo has been especially helpful and patient!  I would highly recommend Allspace!</Text>

<review>Due to the economy, I have had to downsize. I have many generational pieces, books, and photographs that won't fit my new quarters. I am completely secure in having them in 2 units at Allspace Costa Mesa. Storage units there are treated & cared for as though they contained the managers' treasures. Communication from them is always current,  and I am completely in them. Highly recommend this company/location.<//review><Time>1628102562108</Time>< name>

Okay - you can keep your boxes of stuff almost anywhere, truth be told, but if you don’t store your stuff here, you won’t get the terrific customer service from Leo, the nice guy behind the counter here.

I came in all sorts of irritated at my sudden need for storage in a hurry and Leo just made everything easy and quick.

The place is clean, well maintained, and feels safe. I can’t recommend this place highly enough!< /Text>

Leo Artavia has given us the best customer service and care at Allspace Self Storage in Costa Mesa. We have had the most positive service. He is kind and knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend this place and I hope that you get a chance to meet Mr. Artavia as I know you will get the best service ever.!</Review>

<Text>I moved from hB to newport and needed a place to store my stuff i wasnt sure i needed i called a few places and the monthly prices were SO EXPENSIVE i might as well
Live in them!!
I found this place by chance and called them!
They are very genuinely friendly and helpful!
I went in filled up an application picked up a storage unit in a very nice cool area . They have all sizes large and small for your needs. Alot of availability. And they give you a lock!
The place is always clean and no cracked out bums or sketchy people roaming. I feel safe leaving my valuables there and the monthly payments are just automatically out evrymonth!
I see myself storing with them as long as i live nearby and need to stash my stuff.

Ask for Leo and hell take good care of you! Very nice handsome young man!
-great prices
-safe spaces
-always safe and secure! Highly recommended for locals looking to put their extra junk or business equipment or whatever here!</Text>< Gmap_id>

I have rented storage units off and on at Allspace, Costa Mesa since 2008 for business and personal. At the moment I am occupying 2 units at this location. They have always been very personable and if I ever needed help someone was always available to lend a hand.

Thank you Leo and Team Allspace!</review>

<review>This place is easy to find and easy to deal with. Leo and all others who work here seem to understand the problem(s) of having too much stuff in one's life and how to keep that stuff in safe quarters. The staff is responsive and helpful, the place is convenient and accessible, and we appreciate that Allspace has space for us. Thank you.

Leo is so friendly, sympathetic, helpful, and also resourceful. He seems to have ways to solve problems (and "stuff"!) large and small. He is patient about payment difficulties during this endless pandemic, and he & the rest of the staff seem always to "there", no matter what. Thank you for a clean place that is secure.< /review>< pics>

Buy their $18 protection plan coverage
Buy their storage lock
Get on automatic payments<//Text>< pictures>

Recent home projects have caused a need for storage, Leo is an incredible manager to work with and Nathan is following Leo's lead! Like Batman and Robin they are a tremendous team! Thank you very much for maintaining my account and helping me locate the unit I needed for my storage needs! Very competitive pricing, and well maintained units.< /Review>

<username>John Ervin< /username><Text>Ownership changed a year or so ago, and the new setup is really well managed. Leo in the front office has given me a lot of good steers about deals and ins and outs and has also been very personable and friendly as can be. I always have liked this facility, and have used it off and on for twenty years plus, but the new system is a big improvement and so I give five stars. (Also, they expanded payment options, a big plus over the old formats, and now it is quite easy to pay online, or by phone, and all the rest.)

Kudos all around.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
I moved from hB to newport and needed a place to store my stuff i wasnt sure i needed i called a few places and the monthly prices were SO EXPENSIVE i might as well
Live in them!!
I found this place by chance and called them!
They are very genuinely friendly and helpful!
I went in filled up an application picked up a storage unit in a very nice cool area . They have all sizes large and small for your needs. Alot of availability. And they give you a lock!
The place is always clean and no cracked out bums or sketchy people roaming. I feel safe leaving my valuables there and the monthly payments are just automatically out evrymonth!
I see myself storing with them as long as i live nearby and need to stash my stuff.

Ask for Leo and hell take good care of you! Very nice handsome young man!
-great prices
-safe spaces
-always safe and secure! Highly recommended for locals looking to put their extra junk or business equipment or whatever here!<//Review>

Convenient location and great rate. Easy to set up as first-time customer and easy billing process - they have also been extremely thorough with COVID related adjustments. High level of security on premise, I feel very confident storing important items here. Leo and staff are great - friendly, informative, and helpful.<//review>

Allspace is a great spot for storage.  The property is very clean and I have never had any issues.  The units are easily accessible.  The monthly fee is very reasonable compared to other nearby storage facilities.  The onsite staff is great too.  Safe, secure, clean and a great value for the area.< /Text>

Leo truly is amazing. He’s accommodating hardworking, kind, just a good dude in general.
Reading some of the reviews it seems this location has had some rather serious issues in the past. Ever since Leo came on, he almost single handedly turned it around. When I had an issue arise he was professional, & promptly took care of it. (since then I have decided to get another unit!

The place is clean, run well and reasonably priced, etc. Basically all things you’d want from a top notch 5 star self storage place, however what really sets this “All Space Storage” apart is the family atmosphere as you can genuinely feel the hospitality when you arrive..something that’s truly becoming harder and harder to find in 2020, however accordingly that much more appreciated (at less for me).

Thanks again for everything!< /Review>

<Text>This is an outstanding place from beginning to end. Leo, the manager, is very professional, friendly and helpful.  I have been here for approximately ten years. In past years, I would have recommended them, now I definitely would. Leo is extremely responsive and can assist with any needs. There is fabulous service from beginning to end.  The place is very clean, secure and you get great value.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Pleasant attitudes, great customer service and very professional!< /Text>< Date>

I work in the area, so my brother in law and I needed a place to store my instruments , so I yelped storage spots, and this place seemed like they had the best most recent reviews so I checked it out. Shopped at a few other storage places first but the manager Leo definitely was the friendliest of all the places I went to and that right there is what made my decision. So Hey man thanks for the deal, keep up the good work.< /review>

Wonderful location, great facility, and great hours. I choose all space storage because of a handful of reasons, but Leo did a great job of ensuring my stuff will be safe here. My last storage place down the street I was at got broken into.  Thanks Leo!!!< /review>

Pick this place over the other storage facilities in Costa Mesa/Newport beach. I did a great amount of research and I even went physically to each facility to get a feel for each facility before choosing.
Im storing valuable home goods!! So I had to make sure this was the right facility.
I was sold on this place after getting a tour & A+ storage service from their manager and assistant manager.</text>

<review>Long story short, I’ve been coming to all space since 2014. My business stores a lot of inventory here. There has been a different vibe to this place that started about two months ago. No homeless. I feel safe. My phone calls, emails, concerns are handled perfectly.   I appreciate those little things so much that I decided to leave a friendly review!<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Beware! Most of the staff is kind of creepy and extremely nosey. Great move in specials, but that greatness ends there. Those who presumably are the staff, are not customer friendly. With the exception of possibly Van (also add the at that time, new lady who just started), they shouldn't operate a business if they dislike customers so much! The location doesn't lend itself to easily navigating your way there either.< /Text>< pics>

<review>It was great in the beginning then somes lady named Barbara took over and evicted 20+ units including myself.
My advice is to stay away from this storage place.
This place is  not up to par.
I got hurt really bad and they didn't care..
So watch out . They are nothing but a rip off...And I truly hope that Barbara gets fired because of negligence. And harrassment.also I paid another month and she would'nt refund me I did nothing wrong and had to go find another storage. I was happy there until I receoved a eviction notice.which was'nt even explained why.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>I've been a young executive member at this club for a few years and absolutely love it. The level of customer service you receive is beyond what you would expect. Everytime I walk in, I'm greeted by name, as are my guests. The staff is very friendly and are always mindful of when is a good time to interject in a conversation. This is especially important during business meetings. The food is great and the atmosphere is unlike anything else in San Jose.< /text>< Pics>

I would definitely give this place another try.  We visited at a very odd hour and were the only ones sitting outside. But, we were forgotten several times and I never quite knew who was providing our service. In the day, this is a membership-based dining experience. Our drinks and food were both well-prepared. This is absolutely a handicap accessible space.</text>

<review>Great place to go for some drinks and aps/dinner after a work day. Great outdoor rooftop patio on the 17th floor with nice views of down town and the mountains. Food and drinks are great and the service is awesome. Will keep coming back. During the winter or cold nights there is a couple fireplaces and heaters outside.< /review><gmapID>0x808fccbb439ea46b:0x78be976b86728add</gmapID></record>

< Review>
If you are looking for entertainment or wedding venue, it's fantastic. If you are looking for social not beneficial gatherings definitely good. But if you are building business, looking for network or looking for good connections save your money and look for other business oriented club .
Most members are small biz, real estate agents, insurance agents etc.

The Silicon valley Capital Club is at the top floor of the Night Ridder building in DTSJ, the place is clean and the waiters/staff are professional, the views from deck look great.</Review>

I have attended a number of business and networking meetings booked in their event halls (they call them ballrooms).  They really go for the high end vibe, with all sorts of new artsy decor surrounding a decent view of San Jose and the valley. The food catered there is pretty good but nothing spectacular.  One thing to be warned, the on site underground parking is not fully validated, just discounted.< /Text>

I am a member of this club. Great atmosphere and views on the 17th floor. Nice events & networking. Good food in the Vertex lounge and when you want to experience fine dining you will find outstanding cuisine in the Founder's Room. Some of the staff is long term and you get to know them and they you.</Review>

<text>Extremely good location for a meeting venue in San Jose, good front desk staff, good service in general but some ppl seem to be on a learning curve. The AV tech in the meeting rooms badly needs an upgrade and is of suspect reliability. The last two meetings I have had at this venue have suffered from fundamental failures of AV equipment or equipment preparation. In general the AV setup looks like early 2000s-vintage, and compares negatively to any modern, local office in and around San Jose.</text>< Pics>

<Review>We had our company Christmas party here. Our staff and their family members really enjoyed the views, the spaciousness of the lounge, dining area, and the seating @ the bar.

The presentation of the appetizers and entree's was very elaborate. Everything was so delicious with tons of flavor. We had a wonderful experience, thank you Silicon Valley Capital Club!<//Review><Rate>4</Rate>< pictures>

Nice views, so so food, and unattended restrooms.

I attend a daylong meeting/private event at this location recently and was somewhat underwhelmed.    The physical location was nice, had a good view of downtown San José, our catered continental breakfast and buffet lunch had good plate presentation and variety (the salmon and the chicken were tough/overcooked) the flavors pretty mild and lacked depth I would hope for in such a facility.  I  used their restroom 3 times during my visit (once at the start of the day, middle, and end) and I was pretty frustrated to see that the sinks were not cleaned up, one was out of soap (someone had even pulled it out as a symbol), urine spray all over the floor (yes, men in general need to learn to use a urinal appropriately) , and just didn’t looked cared for the entire day.  Kind of sad that no employee is responsible for cleaning that entire time or that an employee using it wouldn’t note it and seek out assistance .

Maybe its different most days, but my experience wouldn't have me returning.<//Text>

Attended the Tree Lighting party as a guest of a member. They were very unorganized, they did not recognize their member as a private club should. The front desk gave instructions and then we went where instructed and waited 20 minutes only to find out they did not accept the drink tickets and the tickets were only for eggnog or bad wine however the front desk daid the tickets were for the full bar. Then we waited in line for food and found no place to sit or even stand at a bar table to eat. Not well planned and not well organized<//text>

Joined here a few years ago. Have generated commissions from referrals emanating from club 10x annual dues. Clubcorp is a class act. Always looking forward to visiting other properties in its collection, whether business/social clubs, country clubs, or health clubs. Some are nicer than others as they tend to buy turnaround assets. SVCC has a nice roof deck, unavailable at most sister locations. Major remodel several years ago. Overall, a bargain compared to Bay Area competitors.</Text>

Situated on the 17th floor, this elegant club offers a wonderful view of downtown SJ on a clear day. The atmosphere and decor is sophisticated yet relaxing to watch a sports game on a large screen tv, along with smaller ones sprinkled throughout the club. The Happy Hour menu changes frequently - I'm hoping they will bring back the delicious well-seasoned homemade potato chips and remove the flavorless sliders.< /Review>

The bartenders made solid drinks, and the fries were perfect (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside), but the snarky waiter was just too much to deal with.</review>

Don't come often, but they're consistently unable to staff for events. 3-4 People at entrance checking tickets, but one(!) bartender + his clueless supervisor making drinks for ~300 ppl. on July 4th Gala.<//Text>

<review>Enishi Kitchen was a Serendipitous encounter 3 yrs ago! It has turned into one of my regular spots for good Japanese & Chinese cuisine. The staff has always been very attentive & friendly. During the height of Covid, I was ordering almost once a week to  show my support. I think it's one of the better places to go to.< /review>< Pics>

For sushi rolls, we love this place! For Chinese fodder, not so much... Well, pork fried rice was good, as was the Chinese Corn Chowder soup. But the rolls were quite divine, and nice touch with the fried onions!< /review>

<Text>My daughter loves raw salmon, I mean, sake sashimi lol, and this place is close to us so we go there often.  I usually have their Lion King roll and I like it.  We have tried their Chinese food, and we don't like the heavy batter on their breaded chicken dishes like the lemon chicken.  The food is never ready by the time they say- I have had to wait more than double the time they told me on the weekends, so I give myself extra time before leaving the house.  The wait staff is usually friendly.<//Text><response>None< /response><Rate>3<//Rate>< Gmap_id>

First time going under new ownership. Sushi is delish. Lots of firsts to try, on the menu. I recommend the sea urchin. Immediately takes you to the ocean. Soo good.There are alcoholic beverages to be had. Will return!< /text>

Really good food! Very fast and reasonably priced. We had the sashimi combo, which had large, high quality cuts of fish. Love all the extra ginger provided, they don’t skimp.  Also, pretty cut greens (instead of those green plastic things) and lemon animals.  Opted for the pot stickers over the gyoza, because they are pan fried instead of deep fried, they were huge, like huge!  Big fan!! Chow mein was tasty.  All in all, we will go out of our way to drop back by.  Thanks!</text>

<text>Food was ok, we wanted to try it for a long time and was disappointed. They don't offer any combo meals for Chinese you have to order everything separately, no soup, etc. Japanese had limited combos.<//text><username>Paula S< /username></record>

For someone who is new to Brentwood, I say that this place is a bit low on customer service and how to entice customers from coming in. I asked what are their most popular sushi, all I hear from Doris what what and what. I would like to elaborate what I asked but I have two more people would like to order so I go along and order what is familiar.< /Review>

Everything was great. We were taking out sushi at another place but they kept getting the orders wrong (and they were also more expensive) so great service, selection and quality was a hit with everyone my new go-to place.</Review>

But the last two times we were there, it was undercooked and we had to keep asking for our food.. As if they forgot it. We keep going back in the hopes that things get better.. But i don't know how many more failed attempts we can swallow.. Literally.</text>< Rating>

<Text>This is a new restaurant in Brentwood. They have Japanese and Chinese food. We tried the chef's choice 12 piece sashimi, the Heart Attack, honey walnut prawns, spider roll and a variety of other food. The Heart Attack is a jalapeno stuffed with cream cheese and crab then deep fried. If a jalapeno popper is a burger, this is a perfectly cooked steak. I definitely recommend trying this. All the sushi and sashimi were prepared perfectly. Great presentation and all the dishes are full of flavor. I don't live close to Brentwood, but would definitely go back to this place again.<//Text>< userid>

If any of you remember Lucy's or like Mikado's, it's right up there. The atmosphere doesn't look that fancy, but don't let that fool you. The food is great. I love everything including their fried rice and any of the noodle dishes. They give pretty good size portions and the service is very good. They also serve sushi and some Japanese dishes, so it's a great pick for a Brentwood Asian restaurant.</review>

<Text>I absolutely love this place. I have been several times and tried both the Chinese and Japanese side of the menu. As someone who loves sushi but doesn't have many local choices this is my favorite spot of all! Everything is always fresh tasting, looks beautiful and tastes better than what you get most places. They are great for take out of dine in. I prefer to dine in as sometimes you can get the sushi chef to make custom creations. Over a truly 5 star restaurant!</Text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><text>Our second time in the past two months, and today came again for lunch.  We are greeted with a warm welcome which, makes you already feel at home. Always friendly smiles and staff is very attentive to your needs. My husband enjoys his Sushi, and I do enjoy my Chinese food (some Sushi dishes) -- perfect for us both !!! Their Sushi presentation is very creative, almost too beautiful to eat. Food is always fresh.  I'm a huge fan of the California roll and they certainly do a great roll. The perfect size for one bite or two.  The menu selection is just right, you don't feel overwhelmed with a busy menu, just enough to keep you coming back for more, and we will.  Love the relaxing music too, just loud enough to enjoy conversation and still have a great ambiance. I have to say that I would have to drive to the bay area for some great Chinese food, now I'm so thankful Enishi Kitchen is near Discovery Bay !!!  We definitely will be back again soon !!!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

<review>Service was decent enough. Quality was pretty poor. Sushi was haphazardly assembled, tempura shrimp was soggy like it had been sitting a while, and the soft shell crab was severely over cooked. The crab meat had the consistency of ash.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

This place was amazing, they serve their food family style which means it's enough to share. The variety of sushi was great also. The only downside about this place is it isn't big enough. I'm glad my husband made a reservation so we got seated right at our reservation time. 😊< /Review>

Really good eats, will be going back. Fish is fresh and we'll cut. Veggies also fresh and crisp. Seasoning is balanced an clean. Chinese food is authentic and tastes homemade. Japanese food is high quality. If I don't see you there that's okay they'll seat me faster<//review>

<Text>The prices online and in person did not match. It is a dollar more expensive when you get there. I think it's important to have that up to date. The meals could be a bit bigger in my opinion.</Text>< user_id>

The place had 2 tables busy only, there were approximately 14 people working in the restaurant, suddenly it felt overstaffed. Japanese tea was weak and tasted like hot water. The rice wrapped around the rolls tasted like there's no seasoning, just cooked rice. Salmon sashimi was fresh and everything else too.< /review>

This is by far my favorite Japanese restaurant. The freshest sashimi. It melts in your mouth.  The sauteed vegetables come out steaming hot and crisp. The chicken in the sweet and sour chicken is large slices and the sauce is delicious. Service is fantastic!<//review>

<Review>My coworker and I went there for the lunch special, but today is a holiday (found out no lunch special on holidays) so we ended up with shrimp fried rice and salt and pepper prawns. I didn't have any expectations but I was surprised by how well-tasting the rice and prawns were.

I live about 9 miles away and I plan on taking the wife there to check out the place.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Slow start at the door for seating, but once recognized by staff things went well. Probably more of an anomaly since service was great thereafter.  Portions slightly small for the price but orders prepared well and shashimi tasted fresh. My wife liked her fish lover roll and side seaweed salad. She would order it again. I'd go back and try other entrees based on good service and cuisine.  I'd add half a star if the app would let me.<//review>

<Review>A great food experience.  This restaurant offers Chinese and Japanese food.  We ordered their chicken teriyaki.  The meal came with miso soup, salad and entree (and a fortune cookie) .  The entire meal was delicious and served fairly quickly despite the fact that it was crowded with people.  In the middle of our meal we decided to order a California roll which was delivered promptly and was mouth watering.  There was enough food that we took some home which made a great lunch the next day.</Review>< Rating>

I’m a Sushi Foodie I only sit @ the bar. I like to watch it being made, and order from the chefs. I only want to eat what’s FRESH. I’ve been to this place once $expensive small portions, presentation nice. Place can be crowded. won’t be a frequent place for me.</Text>

I recently saw that this store is open, and decided to come here instead of waiting in a line at the always busy Slatten Ranch location. The staff here is AMAZING! They are knowledgeable, professional, and so friendly. We had the pleasure to work with Khalil, Yessenia,  Melissa, and Alex. T-mobile is so lucky to have this awesome group representing them. We had some issues transferring from her previous carrier (*cough*Sprint*cough*), but all of these employees helped take care of us, and made sure that we got the right plan for us (my grandfathered plan), with the right phone for her needs. Not only that, but while they were working on getting us up and running, they were talking to us, and I could tell that they genuinely cared. We left with hugs all around! I will be back to this location for any of my future T-mobile needs. Thanks guys!< /Text>

< Review>
I was thrilled to discover a new Japanese restaurant in Brentwood.  However, after ordering the Katsu chicken and vegetable tempura, we may not be returning.

The place was packed full on a Friday evening.  We had to wait about 20 minutes to get a table.  No biggie.

They have a counter along one wall, but it was loosely hanging on and tilted.  Definitely not a stable place to eat.  They need to get rid of that thing.  It looks bad.  Also, they have what looks like a beautiful water fountain behind the check-in counter.  But, this was bone dry, dirty, and just an eyesore to look at wh2n you first walk in.

The chicken katsu was a horrible piece of chicken.  Definitely not a nice clean piece of white meat breast.  50% of the piece was full of fat and gristle, and the other 50% was flavorless cheap dark meat.  This was a huge disappointment.  I have had awesome chicken katsu breasts in the past, but this place does not care to give their customers a nice choice piece of meat.

We might give this place one more try, to see if this was just an unfortunate anomaly.  Not sure.  That chicken was really gross.

Have a little more pride in the food you serve and give your customers a better piece of meat.<//Review>

Honestly I've had better gas station sushi, or from the grocery store. The fish did not taste fresh at all, the rice crumbled and fell apart when you picked it up, the size of everything was small, fish portions tiny, and the ginger tasted artificial.....not impressed unfortunately.<//text>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>First impression was pretty bad, which seemed to setup the rest of the experience. Despite the table we sat at being clean and set when we walked in, it took 10 min to be seated. No one was waiting when we came in, so it was not just waiting for others to be seated. A gentlemen came up to us along if we were picking up an order, when we said no he walked back into the kitchen ignoring us. The nigiri was not bad, but the fish was extremely thin and far to warm considering the rice was not as warm as the fish. My friend went out of his way to order a roll without mayonnaise, as he hates it, when his roll came out it was smothered in a mayonnaise sauce. I may give it a try again in the future to see if it was a fluke, but this is in line with other reviews I have read and the business response tend to be hostile. So I don't see it changing much.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>This was my first and last time eating here.   The food was good, unfortunately the owner had some loud friends over getting drunk.  He was taking shots with them.  It wasn't even 1:00 pm.  They had no respect for the other patrons.  I left with my ears ringing.  I noticed on the tip guide on the bill that the tip is based on the the total amount instead of the pre tax.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<text>Much better experience when this location was Iron Kitchen. Food pricey for quantity and quality. Meat on every entrée was skimpy. Orange chicken a little overly spiced, flavor good, but very little chicken and mostly breading. Mu Shoo had very little, bland and overcooked meat. Magolian Beef was tasty but propotion of meat to vegetables was again low on meat. All portions of all items ordered, including others not specified, were small for the price. Pretty disappointed which we never were when we ordered similar items from Iron Kitchen.</text>< username>

I’ve had several hair appointments with different stylists and they’re always fantastic! Felipe is my go to now but everyone is super friendly and welcoming. Always a nice relaxing experience and the pricing is beyond fair. Clean, stylish environment, with covid precautions taken per usual. The products used are just fabulous overall a high end experience; warm neck towels and special details. After they made my birthday by taking my last minute appointment, I went ahead and booked for my mother in law who is now also a regular. Highly recommend.< /review>

<Review>I was very surprised to read the review below from Jacqueline in which she claimed she was required to wear two masks at Agape.  I have had my hair done at Agape many times during the pandemic and have never been required to wear two masks.  That is just ridiculous and absolutely not true.  As for their professionalism, it is top notch.  Every person at the salon bends over backwards to make sure you are comfortable in the salon and happy with your experience and your haircut.  I would highly recommend this salon.</Review>< rate>

Everyone here is so sweet! Felipe is amazing, did everything in a precise manner and you can tell he really cares about the health of your hair. I moved out here couple years ago from LA and was struggling to find a new hair salon.This is my new hidden gem. Thank you to Felipe for an amazing cut!<//text>

< Review>
I had the worst experience today at Agape Salon.  The protocols I was asked to do where so crazy over the top.  My handbag was taken away from me when I arrived and placed in a plastic bag and I was told I was not allowed to keep my handbag with me. I complied with the hand washing , covid survey , temperature check and even agreed to double mask as they wouldn’t accept my cloth mask.  I told the owner I had difficulty breathing and wouldn’t be able to keep both masks over my nose for 1.5 hours.  The owner refused to allow me to keep the mask under my nose and then refused to do my hair.   I’ve never been treated this rudely at any salon.   I think this owner forgets he’s in the customer service business   I would recommend to stay far away from this salon and their rude treatment<//Review>

I checked the reviews before I came in, thinking it was OK. However, this was the worst hair experience ever. I feel so bad for my kid. My kid was let down and felt completely insecure after this cut. not happy

also the owner seems pretty rude given their responses to other customers, "thank you Karen -- oops Jacqueline" (see image of the screenshot). I understand if someone can't have double masks, but please let them use their own as we don't really feel comfortable of where you store your masks.

CDC does not say you're required to use the store's mask. Just don't call a customer a Karen when you obviously know their name, Ya?</Text>

<Date>1593655611461</Date><review>I have been a customer of Agape for many years and have never been disappointed   Upon arrival, I am always greeted by the friendly and professional staff.  During my recent visit during the pandemic, many protocols were in place so that I felt very safe and comfortable throughout the time I was given hair services.
Ana is my usual hairstylist and she does a terrific job.  She always listens to my needs and addresses them perfectly.  My haircuts and color services are terrific.  My friends always comment to me about how wonderful I look when I leave the salon.  I highly recommend this salon for their professionalism and highly trained and skilled staff.< /review>< user>

<Review>Agape Salon & Spa is by far the most professional and creative party planner that I've worked with thus far. He helped me with my uncle's 50th birthday party and exceeded my expectation. He is punctual, organized, and communicates very well. We had many visions for what we wanted and he helped us focus and make it happen! Thank you so much Luis. I am your new lifetime customer!!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I totally hearts these guys/gals. I've only been here once and looking forward to my next visit.
Staff: It was a new experience to see hairdressers helping each other and supporting each other. I was really impressed by that and their kindness towards each other.
Experience: uhmmm... Helllo... Aromatherapy! hot towel for my neck with aromatherapy and my hair was wrapped in another hot towel with aromatherapy. Total heaven! This was a spa day for my hair. :)
Results: I love the results. The cut is great and the color is AMAZING! From the picture I showed I thought we would have needed to do 3 different colors to get depth but Felipe did all 3 color levels with using just bleach. He is amazing!
Overall: I highly recommend this place!<//Text>

I had an amazing time at this salon! Jennifer Parkhurst is the stylist who cut my hair and she didn’t miss a beat! She went above my expectations and she is extremely friendly! The place itself is serene and the price is amazing for all they offer with a simple haircut. Definitely recommend this place to all friends and acquaintances<//review>

< Review>
When I arrived at Agape Salon for my appointment, my hair was a mess!
The color was growing out and my ends were split terribly. Anna did a Balayage on my hair with conditioning treatments. She also trimmed my hair.  When she was done, I couldn't believe it was actually MY hair.  My hair was beautiful and healthy.  I went out to dinner with my husband that night and received so  many compliments from several people.  Thank you Anna! You are truly a professional and very knowledgeable.< /Review>

< review>
I just moved to the Palm Springs area from NYC and did some thorough research before putting my hair in the hands of a new stylist. ( I wasn't thrilled about having left my hair stylist of 20 years back East). But, I feel so lucky to have discovered and decided upon making an appointment at Agape Salon. The Salon is peaceful and clean and comfortable and everyone is lovely! I had my hair colored and cut by Angelica and she was fabulous! Owner Anna is a professional and is running a pro salon! I love my hair color and cut! This is my go-to-Salon now! Thank you Anna & Angelica!

P.S. I was also very impressed with the Covid-19 protocol at the salon - it is more thorough than I have experienced anywhere. I really appreciate the safety and care they are taking during this health crisis.<//review>

First visit to Agape Salon. The staff is following Covid19 protocol, temp taken upon arrival, fresh mask and gown/cover and everyone 6 feet apart. My stylist Analisa did an OUTSTANDING job with my color and cut. Made my next appointment before departing! Highly recommend this salon 💃< /text>

< Review>
So regretful that I chose this salon. I went in with a clear explanation of the color I wanted,  and even showed Ana Lisa several photos of my platinum hair color on MY head. I stressed that my biggest concern was that she get the right color. Well, not only did it turn out so bad,  I ended up with pinkish purplish hair!!  She never said a word when she took off the foils, just turned my chair away from the mirror and proceeded to blow it out, knowing full well what a disaster it was!  When I turned my head to look,  I was shocked!  To think I was afraid of a brassy color.  This was pink hair!!  And upon further inspection I even found patches of purple and lavender!  I just don't get it. My previous hairdresser had no problem at all with my hair. I question how much experience this girl even has with color, or whether or not she's even licensed!  I'm also very disappointed with the owner,  Anna.  I initially consulted with her,  and when I realized she was way out of my price range, she referred me to Ana Lisa.  The thing is,  I expressed to Anna as well, that my biggest concern was the color.  Why refer me to someone who clearly has little experience in color??  So upset and disappointed.   To add insult to injury? Instead of accepting responsibility and apologizing, she tried to blame me and our consultation!  Girl,  I showed you actual photos!!  And FYI, my previous highlights had already grown out, so she couldn't even blame it on that.  To the receptionists credit,  she was much more apologetic and offered to have it fixed at another time,  however,  I'm  absolutely petrified to go back.  I have pics, but I guess this site doesn't allow you to post pics. You can catch them on Yelp.

***In response to the owner's reply:

Talk about a back-handed apology!  Why bother if you are putting it that way and slandering me?  I've never met you, nor were you there, so either you received a slanted view of what happened, or you're just plain lying, in a vain attempt at damage control, because what you're saying is simply a blatant lie. "We also tried to fix your hair and could of done it. But you were just not having it." - absolutely false.  They wanted me to come back another day, and I absolutely did set an appointment, then left. The problem lies with your stylist. I did not speak to anyone except her and the receptionist, the receptionist AND the stylist with whom I had a very pleasant conversation with both. I was not rude to anyone, but let's say for the sake of argument, that what you are saying is true. That would mean you are inferring that your staff deliberately ruined my hair in retaliation? This is a just horrible thought that a business would do something like that. Now I understand why Ana Lisa didn't want to accept responsibility.   You are her boss and she takes her cues from you.  You set the example - and not a very good one.  FYI, I absolutely considered coming back ( since I live in Los Angeles so this is no easy task).  Upon further consideration, I decided I am too fearful to return.<//Review>

<Review>We moved to Palm Desert last Sept and I was looking to get a new hairdresser. After looking on the internet, I decided on Agape Salon and I couldn't be more pleased. Ana took the time to find out exactly how I wanted my hair done. The best part is after the color is through setting in. You get an absolutely fantastic shampoo, head and neck massage which makes you so relaxed! I  have never felt so pampered. This place is a jewel. And Ana did my hair exactly how I wanted it.

And all that with everyone, including clients wearing masks. The stylists wear gloves as well.

There are partitions between all stylists and their clients with proper attention to social distancing. I will be back again! So glad they are back open!</Review><userid>104847524477775398636< /userid></record>

I love this place!!! Getting my hair washed is probably the most amazing part. Never uncomfortable.They give an amazing hand and neck massage while you lay down in a nice relaxing atmosphere. The oils they have are amazing. Other than that they always offer a delicious hot tea or water. They sit with you before they touch your hair just to go over exactly what you want done. I highly recommend Ashley as my go to stylist. She is the best!!<//review>

<Review>This hair salon, by far, is second to none. I love that the haircut includes hand and head massage. By the time I'm done with massages and ready for haircut/services, I'm ready for bed! Lol. But I would like to also mention that the sink chairs are the most comfortable ones I've sat on. I'm short so most of the salons I have been to, my legs either hanging or missing the recline so my neck would be stiff and uncomfortable. Agape Salon's chairs are like beds; and the staff cradles my neck with a hot towel, putting me completely to a relaxed mode.

Anna Jimenez is such a good listener and very experienced with hair. I would recommend her 100 percent. I absolutely love going to this salon, including my husband. Anna took the time to show me how to put a lift on my fine hair. My husband is hooked on the massage, as well; and his haircut from Anna is always awesome!< /Review>< Pics>

This is it! The salon experience you are looking for! I'm ridiculously picky when it comes to salons, I need the perfect location, ambience, shampoo, cut AND something special to make me happy and Agape has it all! Great, convenient location close to lovely lunch places. Cool yet calming decor with great music. The shampoo session comes with massage, aromatherapy AND jewelry cleaning. The best haircut I've ever had! Plus, they offer a drink and are informative but not pushy about product. Seriously, I've tried more than 10 salons in the desert and this is THE ONE.<//review>

<name>Sheena Marie</name><Date>1557592966978</Date><rating>3<//rating><Review>My boyfriend scheduled me an appointment here to get my makeup done for his sister's wedding. The makeup artist asked me what I wanted and I told her a clean fresh face look with full coverage but I did not want to have makeup done like hers. I felt her makeup was a little dramatic for the type of event but I explained I understood that she needed it for her job. I ended up getting my makeup done almost exactly like hers. I tried fixing my makeup in the car before the event as best I could but I could not hide the huge wing tip that she put on the sides of my eyes. After seeing the wedding pictures I'm so thankful that my boyfriend told her to tone down my makeup the first time or else I would have looked even worse. Idk know what you call this look but way to have me meet my boyfriend's family for the first time. Thanks but no thanks. 🤦< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV743HbaSfAEgPknNXf6WUkRlG8HklkqkcHLJC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< response>

They asked me what products I use in my hair and my hair type. Then came the wash, and that was amazing. Hand massage and aromatherapy during the hair washing process. I was very satisfied with my haircut and made a second appointment to color my hair. The hair coloring process was just as thorough.

<text>Exceptional salon absolutely one-of-a- kind hair experience ever!!. Ana was kind sensitive and took her time both in a consultation but again during my actual appointment to make sure I was relaxed and happy. The therapeutic hand massage while color set was the top pampering. Everything about Agape is simply amazing. I have found a home for all my hair and spa needs. The Rancho Mirage gem. A natural sincere caring salon. 10 stars plus!

<review>I’ve been coming to this salon as it was recommended by my sister. I started off with a wonderful stylist by the name of Rebecca. Unfortunately I was told she no longer worked there so I decided to try someone new. I had my color done by a great stylist named Analisa and she did my color amazing. I was so pleased with her work and patience. I recently went for a cut and had the master stylist Angelica cut it as I am picky with my cuts. She did AMAZING! I asked for a blunt bob and she did so and I’ve been loving it. I have styled it in 3 different ways already and it looks so good in any of the styles. Thanks girl (;  I recommend both Analisa and Angelica.</review>< user>

<text>I was on vacation in Palm Springs when I decided that I wanted to do something new with my hair. I visited Agape Salon because of the great reviews they have online. They did an amazing job on my hair. I couldn't be happier with the beautiful salon and great service they gave me. I would recommend this salon to anyone. I am now a regular customer for sure.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

If I could give Agape Salon more than 5 stars I would!! Everybody is very friendly and they speak both English and Spanish. Arlen is amazing, she listens to you to achieve the results you want, she is very patient and very good at her job! I am very happy with my cut and color and my hair looks and feels super healthy<//text>

<text>I found this gem of a salon accidentally this past year and I would never go anywhere else. These women are top notch and extremely professional. I cant say enough about this salon. I am extremely picky about my hair and they do an amazing job every single time. They listen to what you want, but also make recommendations as well. All star service! The women are talented, patient and kind.<//text><time>1507406430760<//time>< pics>

Modern, clean and exceptional attention to detail.  My cut & color was well beyond expectation and the special pampering extra nice.  My first visit here and have already scheduled my next appointment.  You won't be disappointed if you make an appointment.< /Review>

It's truly a spa and hair experience.  Ashley is very knowledgeable.  They're always kind, professional, on time, and attentive.  I love my hand and neck massages that come with every service - plus the aromatherapy during the shampoo is divine.</review>

Ana, the owner of Agape Salon is warm and relaxed and is a true master at both color and cut. The vibe of the Aveda house feels spa-like. Tami, the manager is a great communicator and facilitator. The service is comparable to top  Los Angeles salons. I give Agape five stars without reservation!< /Text>

Don't go anywhere else! This is by far the BEST haircut place I've ever had! I walked in, got offered some hot tea or water to relax myself. There was a whole bunch of awesome Aveda products they sell. So I browsed a bit. After tea, I met Angelica who is the lead stylist. She consulted me for a bit. She asked what was my concern with my hair and how I wanted it to be cut. I showed her pictures and she said she will mold it into what works for me. She trimmed my hair a bit. Then I got my hair washed while getting a hand, neck, and head massage. It was the best experience I had for getting a haircut! After washing, I got my hair blow dry and styled a bit (just some curls at the end for volume). The next hard part,  which was my concern was the bangs. I haven't had bangs in such a long time so I was afraid of how it would work. Anyways she executed it! My hair even smells sooooooo good! She put some shine to my hair! Anyways I loved it but she said if I wanted my bangs a bit shorter then I could come in the same week to have it cut at no charge. I actually went back the next day because I wanted it even shorter. She had no problem with it. I came in and even bought the product that she used to help my hair shine. They won best of the best in this desert through yelp so that speaks volume for itself. Price was very very decent! It was definitely affordable. I love Angelica and the girls! From now on I'm coming back whenever I need a haircut!< /Text>

My intro to Agape started a couple of years ago with Tami answering a lot of questions about Aveda products and Agape services. She is totally enthusiastic, fun and thankfully very patient! Ana has been my stylist and her consultations are great because she truly listens to you and doesn’t try to oversell you on looks that might not work... she is so connected to her clients and offers great suggestions to “enhance” my look. I’ve never been complimented so much on a haircut as when Ana has done it!! You will be pampered from start to finish and literally float out of there. I also like the diversity of the clients, it’s definitely a salon for everyone. I hope you enjoy your experience at Agape as much as I do. Thank’s for reading!<//Review>

I am a long term client of Ana, having followed her to her beautiful new Agape Salon several years ago. It is unbelievable how delightful the Agape experience is. The staff is warm, friendly, professional and talented. It is truly a "spa", as well as a first class hair salon! I love the pampering....long shampoos, scalp massages, hand massages and even the cleaning of your rings). All of this gives one that "Ahhhhh"  😎 relaxed feeling !

I have never had to wait, and  noticed  that stylists are not being rushed, running behind or distracted. Tami, the secretary/ coordinator,  is also terrific in greeting, organizing, and handling clients,...as well  as efficiently processing payments and scheduling appointments.

All operators appear to be master stylists. Ana is "a super master stylist". She listens carefully, remembers how you like your hair  and welcomes any and all of your questions or suggestions. Ana performs flawlessly, exhibiting her many years of experience. She treats her clients like family and always wears a smile. One would never guess that she is also the owner of the Salon, with so many responsibilities. The use of Aveda products in the shop,  is a also great plus!

Obviously, I would (and do) strongly recommend Ana and Agape Salon to everyone (male and female) !!

Thank you,
Dona Strickland</Text>

Great welcoming salon where everybody is very friendly and call you by name. Looking for a different experience in a salon I would recommend Agape Salon and Spa. Face and hand message is included with your hair style and cut at a very reasonable price.<//text>

Very poor customer service. Long line, no movement. Customer st cash-out had items that employee could not find with her hand held gadget. One man was there on a phone apparently calling for help. Not sure why he could help but he was utterly useless. Left and shopped at Home Depot
Much better service< /Text>

We bought a couple appliances all at once as we are moving into a house and needed essential appliances. We asked to pick it up the next day all together as they had “everything” in stock. We spent over an hour waiting for them to find all of our items and ended up not having one of them and we had to wait even longer to try to find a replacement.</Review>

<Review>They had everything I needed. One thing to watch for - make sure you are charged the same price at the register that is shown on the shelf. My products rang up higher on the register than the shelf price.  Otherwise everything else was fantastic.<//Review></record>

Great place to shop for home repair, gardening, tools, RV supplies, and more. I've been a Lowes customer for years and have never had a bad experience or had to take back things I bought there. The only thing I dont like is the size of these types of stores. You get your exercise just shopping there.< /review>

Remodeling my kitchen was in that apartment for over 2 hours with a designer was amazing extremely impressed by the professionalism and also the wealth of knowledge you wouldn't think you would get that out of Big Box store but he's not here two circles around the people that have been doing it for years definitely recommend if you're looking for your kitchen remodel. I either that the designers will take care of you and I'll do it right<//text>

If you know what you what and where its located then it is ok.  Good luck trying to  find someone  to help you.  The clerk we finally spoke to  was not that helpful.  He acted like we were a bother.   Needless to say I did not make a single purchase and left the store.<//Review>

< review>
I will never shop at Lowes ever again!! After checking rates with the Corp 800 # was told if I ordered 1,000 or more from Lowes, shipping is free!! Regular delivery would be 75 if less than 1000. I ordered 1200 worth of items and was charged 90. for delivery. I called the store told them what I was quoted by Corp and the gal said instead of me staying on hold she'd talk to the manager and get back to me! She never did. So I canceled the order! Next morning I get an email saying they won't cancel it!!</review>

<Review>Terrible customer service. Employees always on their phones, sitting down, and in such a hurry to not help you. After purchasing a dryer they documented my number wrong, and has caused so much inconvenience. IDK if they are mistreated or what but 2x my experience in buying appliances has sucked!< /Review>< pictures>

One of the worst big box home improvement stores. I spent thousands of dollars on different delivers including 2 different lumber deliveries and a stone masonry delivery. All delivers where never on time, one was completely forgotten about.  I’ve emailed corporate several times now to no avail. They email back but there still using the same horrible contract delivery company DSI.  At this point the responsibilities falls on Lowe’s for using them and not correcting the problem.  I rented a trailer for the day today to pick up a large delivery order that was placed in store at the chico, ca location days ago.  And the order of lumber was never even filled.  The lack of unprofessionalism is mind blowing. Do not shop at the Chico, Ca location. I’m not sure how others are ran so I do not want to bad mouth them. Thanks<//text>

We recently purchased a refrigerator and FRANTZ helped us with getting exactly what we wanted and had it delivered the next day! After 6 weeks of dealing with a failed fridge, he gave us excellent customer service and advised us extraordinary well with everything we needed to know! He is a great guy that took the time to get us the help we needed!< /review>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>Store is way too big & I found it impossible to find help, even tho there were employees all around, they either walked away be4 I reached them, were too busy, two were actually helping other customers so I know at least they do their job. Id have to say the worst is a tie between trying to chasean employee with a bad knee & not getting them before they disappeared and the one who looked at me yet still simply flat out ignored me as if I didn't exist right in front of him, trying to ask a question.. I have to say, I really miss OSH. They were always helpful & store wasn't easy to get lost in. Tomorrow I'll try Home Depot.. After I go return the useless item purchased from Lowes, which, had I had help, I would have known it was useless & wouldn't have bought it. So extra steps because Lowes has aweful customer service..</text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<review>As much as I love shopping at Lowes their customer service for home delivery items is the worst.  When I ordered my refrigerator I was told I would receive a call the day before with a 4 hr delivery window; never received any call. After 3 calls to Lowes by me/ being on hold for over 30 minutes/ getting hung up on, I was able to speak to "Jennifer" the delivery supervisor who was so abrupt and has NO business working in any capacity with customers; not once did she try to find a resolution that would work, leaving me no options but to cancel my whole order.  NEVER again will I order anything from Lowes that involves delivery service from them.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808328977a43aa13:0xada171fbd02af7cd<//gmapID></record>

Really disappointed in the flooring dept. We are looking to put in laminate flooring so we thought we would look into the $1 sq ft deal they have going on now. While at the store we asked if the flooring we liked would work with the deal, we were told yes so we scheduled an appointment for an estimator to come out ($45). Before he came out I called Lowe’s again to check and make sure the flooring we liked worked with the deal, again I got a yes confirmation. The outsourced contractor came out and was great. We were told by him and the 2 Lowe’s employees we spoke to that we should have a quote within 72 hrs... it took almost a week to get a quote back. Called Lowe’s to see why we had not see a quote and spoke to a very rude gentlemen who didn’t actually work in flooring but use to be the assistant manager in flooring (?) weird and super rude guy who actually suggest we go with a different company and continued to make excuses when really it was just Lowe’s having poor customer service. A few days later we finally get a quote and guess what, the flooring we wanted wasn’t part of the $1 sq ft deal. So you can imagine my disappointment when I continuously checked with Lowe’s employees about this deal.

The price for everything still wasn’t bad, but for how poorly Lowe’s has handled things and rude their employees have been it’s really not worth it to us and not do we trust them to do the job right after so many let downs.<//text>

<Review>The store is usually nice to visit. I saw the hammock hanging with a price on it back in June and asked if an employee if it was for sale due to seeing a price tag on it. The employee told me the floor model is not for sale and that they have more arriving in a couple weeks. So OK no hammock for me that day. I came back in early July to see the hammock hanging with a clearance sign on it this time. I asked another employee if they were in stock and the person said they just sold out. A couple weeks later on July 19th and asked the employee if they were getting anymore of these hammocks in and the employee told me they have been sold out for quite a while and they are probably not getting anymore in. Alright so I ended up getting one at Walmart for the same price just as high quality and free shipping. I guess this is why online shopping is winning over customers. Maybe it's time this hardware store needs an overhaul on team communication. Every employee told me a different story. I am having a hard time believing these hammocks were ever restocked. So management take a look at your store and consider taking down items on display if you do not plan on restocking them. It is misleading and a waste of your customers time.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I generally like my experiences at lowes, this visit was fine but some folks need to get better aquatinted with what you offer, or at least different people need to know different sections of the store. I asked if a particular piece of a pump was available, rather than the whole kit, and I was told no, you just have to buy the whole kit. I was awaiting my spouses response about the size of the kit needed, 2" or 3", and found the exact piece I asked for a moment later. Thank goodness I happened to keep looking because I saved myself about $20.00. Still, overall I like the store and appreciate the social distancing measures during the pandemic.</Review>< pics>

Never ever buy an appliance from Lowe’s.  I purchased a new washer and dryer from Lowe’s in the beginning of June, it was delivered at the end of June.  From the beginning it didn’t seem to get the clothes clean or properly desolve the pods I was using.  I tried changing to powdered soap but things still weren’t clean.  I found my receipt and it said I had 90 days to return or repair.  When I called they told me it didn’t matter what my receipt said it was only 30 days and after being transferred from department to department and being hung up on twice I was told use my warranty very rudely and laughed at. It had been less than 2 months.

By the way the numbers Whirlpool gave me either didn’t service this area or weren’t dealing with Whirlpool any longer.

I finally found out the transmission was faulty and it had never worked.

Only one self check-out was open and there were lots of old people ahead of me. I put my item back on the shelf, and that line didn't move at all in the time it took me to walk to the back of the store, and then put the front door. I'll come back next week.<//Text>

<text>Although 90% staff were masked, Only 2/3 of the customers wore masks today. I had just come from Home Depot, which requires everyone in the store to wear masks and will stop you at the door if you do not have one.  I confronted three male customers a Lowe’s about their absence of masks. There was no violence, but it certainly was disruptive for all of us; One man was embarrassed and another thanked me and the third person just ignored me. I asked to speak to the manager at Lowe’s who was polite but claimed that she was following corporate requirements to follow CDC guidelines. I’ll take my business to Home Depot as long as this continues.<//text><userid>104261900431847181101</userid>< Pictures>

<text>I like the store layout. Easy to find items, and the staff was nice.  On the other hand. The prices seemed a bit high, and I would have traded the nice staff for a knowledgable one. Clean and refreshing vibe all together. I would and will shop there again.<//text>< gmap_id>

I like Lowe's, it's like Home Depot's little brother. I like the selection of home improvement items, but I have noticed the quality of certain items are kinda low. Still, if you are in the area and need lumber or basic building materials or tools you can get them here. The employees are polite and knowledgeable, and are always willing to answer questions.</Text>

<text>Ordered a chain link 6x12 gate.  It's been a month.  No communication from Lowe's.  I cancelled the order.  Guess they did not need my $800. I really needed that gate!  Back to the drawing board.
Thanks  Chico Lowe's! 😡<//text>< Pics>

Extremely poor online order and pickup experience.  Had a $3,000 order confirmed as ready. Went to pick it up, they couldn't find it. Took an hour and 20 minutes for them to locate and bring it out. Disgusting.</Text>

Bought a dishwasher and looked at fridges and washer/dryer sets. Employees were very helpful and even let us test to see if our young kids could get things out of the fridges. Great place to check out it's in person even if you end up buying somewhere else</Text>

Few days ago I went to Lowes. I was looking for an item. One clerk did not bother looking with me or check the system for The isle location  and sent me across the store on a wild goose chase. The item was nowhere to be found. Another employee, on the same day,  told me I could find what I was looking myself. Worthless and the laziest employees I’ve ever encountered.< /Review>

Today my family of 3 went to buy some wood and got help from one of the workers. His name was Aidan. He was really helpful selecting the wood and when we load the wood which were too long to fit in our van and were trying to put the red flag to the sticking wood at back of the car, he must have seen us strugglingand he came with a plastic flag and a stapler and helped with it. He went above and beyond the ordinary level of help. I hope some Lowes person and reward him for his worderful service!!!!
Thank you Aidan!!!!<//text>

Was recommended by a friend to go to Jamie in appliances since she had a great experience with her and was told she was  very helpful and informative. However I went in and found out she no longer works there. When I went in to get help in appliances I could not find any one to help me..... The managers need to keep staff that is helpful and make sure there are enough help in departments so people do not feel discourage when shopping..<//Review>< Pics>

Store staff are not very socially skilled or seem to care very much about helping customers. Minimal politeness and responsiveness, but nothing beyond that. I hesitate to ask for help in that store, and do not look forward to their usual interaction at checkout. Their customer service rates a 1, but their inventory and store appearance are very good.< /text>

<Text>If you want your floors done!! Run!!! I was completely screwed over by Lowe’s in Chico who took over 6 months to complete my floors, at which time my entire house was under construction because of them. They were unprofessional, phone calls were ignored, many no show appointments, many unreturned phone calls, many managers, including the main store manager were involved in the situation. I was not compensated in ANY way do to the loss of use of my home and loss of days from work. Hope this helps any body to prevent the long suffering I endured. Plus it was over $2,000 for 300 sq ft. I learned the hard way!</Text><Pics>None</Pics><user_name>Brigitte B</user_name>< GmapID>

I really enjoy shopping here, this place is ALWAYS clean and organized. I would like to see this place bring back the price match guarantee so I can do all my shopping here rather than get half of my things elsewhere. The huge complaint I have is the people behind the lumber/pro counter are more concerned with the conversations they are having, not helping customers.<//text>

I go to Lowe's pretty often. Mostly, because it is so close. It does seem that you are usually on your own if you are having trouble finding something. But, the employees that help are always very nice. My guess is, they minimize the staff to keep the costs down. I did have Lowe's put a fence in my back yard. The person that gave me a quote also told me that a large limb on a tree would not have to be cut if I put a 6 foot fence in instead of a five foot fence. Yeah, I lost a major limb in the tree. They also mis-measured the spacing for the fence posts, so they had to put an extra post in, which looks pretty strange. I am guessing that fence installation gets contracted out. The two that did my fence seemed pretty young. I also had Lowe's install my laminate floor in my house. They did a pretty decent job on that. Well, who ever they contracted to do it, that is.< /review>

A great place to find almost anything you need for your home.
There are a couple of star employees that Lowes is so very lucky to have.  Namely,  Anthony and Monique who work in the back left corner of the store next to all the appliances,  Anthony is one of the most kind honest and creative men I've ever met.  Monique radiates enthusiasm who gives her all with a  genuine smile that literally lights up the room!
Hopefully you'll get a chance to work with these two!</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Seriously? I just bought a refrigerator. First of all for some reason the computer wouldn’t except my phone number so they asked me to make up a phone number. Secondly I decided it was too small wanted to upgrade to another model that was on the floor only to be told that even though it’s on the floor they don’t have any in stock and they can’t sell it and I can’t allow me to purchase one because they can’t guarantee when it would be coming in. Why do they have it on the floor? It’s ridiculous very misleading. And someone needs to redo their computer software.< /review>< Pictures>

Help finding SOMETHING would be nice,  but first you have to find SOMEBODY, then stand on your head & cross your fingers and hope they know just a tiny bit about what you're asking. Stick with asking what aisle it's on,  Google your questions, and MAYBE, just maybe you'll get home in time for dinner. That's assuming the cashier knows what they are doing.....<//Review>

Skip was awesome as well as cashier in garden center...Amanda I believe.  And Debra the manager gave us a discount in some sad looking flowers.  50 bags of bark was a little much.<//Review>

I'd suggest to NOT use the order online and pickup in store option. It's never worked after a handful of attempts (5+ attempts). A number of times I have ordered online and got to the store (hours later) only to find the order hasn't been processed. No call to let me know its not ready, no call to let me know its ready. A few times, the app would show x15 of an item in stock, so I'd order  only to get there to pick up and be told it's out of stock after waiting hours  I've wasted a lot of time and gas $ using the online order  Besides that  they are OK  Products are good<//Review>

< review>
Horrible Service, went on a weekday midday the store had only a few customers yet we had to wait 20 min to get help in the flooring department. When someone finally showed up they pointed us to the wrong product, thankfully I read the fine print before buying and realized it would have ruined the flooring. Then at checkout we were told our phone number wasnt working for a military discount and we were directed to customer service. Only one person out of the three staff members was apparently able to access the military discount set up, and that person was busy, so the rest of the customers behind us were helped while we had to wait. After 10 min of waiting I decided to look online and was able to register it on my phone while waiting and we were able to finally go back over and checkout. Save your time and shop elsewhere!</review>

Normally I don't have any problems with this store. Today I knew exactly what I was going to get and asked as I went in for assistance. By the time I finally got help after asking 3 times Eric and I loaded the table and chairs. I had to get assistance with the lift I would have gotten in trouble doing it myself (even though I know how).< /Text>

Someday I dream of being middle class enough to shop at Lowe's.  They are quite pricey for common items but more reasonable for the true home improvement type stuff: faucets, lumber, nice gravel, bug spray, etc. This Lowe's has very friendly staff (90%), and is like a quieter and more laid back version of Home Depot.< /Text>

<review>I placed an order in store and was told it would be in, in 3 weeks,I received a call that it would be an additional week. Called for a status update and was told it had arrived a week earlier..... when I arrived to pick it up it couldn't be found....
I asked for a phone call once it was located. About 30 minutes later I got a call to come get it.
Again  when I showed up, they couldn't find it...
When they finally located it, the box was torn open and crushed in some areas.
The staff is more interested in joking with each other and standing around rather than taking care of customers.
One of the female staff members also dropped the f bomb in front of me while talking to a fellow staff member.
I was not impressed with the level of service I received from the staff at Lowe's...</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>We had to get a new lawn mower today. Because our old one finally blew up.  We didn't have to wait long for someone to help us. But of course the one we wanted was not in stock. They would have to order it. We couldn't wait. So the lady helped us pick one out that was affordable and with a better engine.  And of course we get the mower home and put it together. And it was missing 2 bolts to the handle bars.  So for now we had to rig it to work.</Text>< Pics>

There's a lot of walking to be done at Lowes, but they do have a few electric carts for people to use.  I find their prices cheaper than Home Depot on some things they carry.</Review>

Carpet installation was 3-4 weeks out and they didn't have a person to install blinds either hired yet, they said it could be a week or months until they hire someone. On a positive note I've been happy with the paint department, super educated and friendly.</Text>

<user_name>Kathie Leung</user_name><Resp>None< /Resp><text>Update: Pretty irritating when a sleepy eyed employee mixes up the paints when mixing them causing a 4+ hour delay in an already severely impacted job. It'll be fixed, but assuredly there'll be no compense for the impacted schedule. Reduction of a star.

Hit or miss with customer service here. Sometimes you can find someone to help, other times it's a push. The prices are decent, there's a pretty decent selection of product, but this recent visit had us frustrated when the paint department's 3 employees ignored customers, not even bothering to acknowledge them and once we did garner ones attention, the lack of information we tried to solicit was like pumping a dry well with the enthusiasm of a wet wool blanket. Not what you'd expect before noon.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><UserId.>117459179827416364560<//UserId.>< Rating>

Don't bother......they often don't have what you want....they've cut pay to their staff so the service is awful. Get it online. You'll get better service and better selection at the same prices.<//Review>

<text>Lowes has excellnt merchandising, helpful staff and good front end customer service.  Prices are good and selection outstanding in their appliance section and carpeting.  However, delivery and communication of deliveries is more than lacking.  Not aware of a delivery, erroneous emails of delivery of items, have to call to verify if a delivery is going to happen and even if the product has actually hit the store's warehouse for delivery.  This has been a problem on each and every delivery that has been scheduled (and there have been a few)</text>< time>

I love lowes!! I can always get the tools I need. I HATE that they sell plants! They don't care about their plants. They are too big to care. In my opinion plants should be purchased locally and not from huge corporations. Other than that lowes is a great corporation with the things you need.</Review>

I like this store, I keep thinking it's the same as Home Depot, but Lowes always has different items. It's more like a Do it Yourself department store. Lots of neat BBQs and really cool patio furniture. Always walking out with something at this store! We love it!< /Text>

Not impressed at all!  I am new in town, and I was in need of a key made. I arrived after work and I was still wearing my medical scrubs. While trying to figure out how the self-propelled key-machine works an employee  walked by so I asked her to assist me.  She looked me up and down, laughed and said, you look like you can handle it - popped her collar and continued on her way!  Needless to say, I found assistance across Skyway.  Lowes you can definitely do better!</review>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>McKenna helped us out with our pickup of a lawn mower and she helped out at first and then just went back inside and left us outside waiting around for 30 minutes. Had to go in three times to big hem to help us out and the manager Ben got caught up with another customer instead of carrying out our customer service needs. Leading us to be there well over an hour waiting. I was extremely disappointed with Chico Lowe’s customer service; if you start helping a customer, you don’t stop helping them until you have helped them complete their needs.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><GmapID>0x808328977a43aa13:0xada171fbd02af7cd<//GmapID>< userid>

<text>I have never had a bad experience at this Lowe's. The employees have always been nice and helpful. They match prices from other stores. They always have what I am looking for and sometimes better ideas for fixing problems. The other home improvement store is about 5 minutes closer to me but I drive by that store to go to Lowe's.</text><user_id>105008034613565952702</user_id>< Gmap_id>

Matt who took out and put in our cabinets was awesome.  Knowledgeable and super friendly.  When it came to the counters the guys installed a wrong color on one part of our counter, put nail holes in our new cabinets and when we filled a complaint we haven’t heard back from counters dept after 3wks.  Super disappointed in the work from Lowe’s.  And I have been going to Lowe’s for years.  Wish I had gone some where else for our kitchen to be re done.  We started this in December of last year and it’s still not done.  There’s still tile work to be done.  Lowe’s is NOT DOING that for us.< /Text>< user_id>

Very approachable floor staff  who are generally knowledgable and seemingly eager to assist the customer...its always clean and i never feel out of place there even when im using incorrect terminology for whatever part or tool im seeking, and while im admitting to zero hands on experience (usaully the case!) and constantly refering to "the youtube video" etc....
Lowes always has great deals on something! I get alot of ideas just browsing thru the isles..<//Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>Horrible, when asking for help, I was told to go and look for what I wanted.  I then asked the employee if he could show me where it was at because I was a little confused as to what I was looking for, the employee pointed to the back again oh, I've been turned over to the other employees standing there and asked him the same question. He even told me the same thing so I just turned around and looked at the oath of them, and fed I asked if you didn't mind showing me where it was at. They both had an attitude like they did not want to move so I said well maybe I should call her manager at which time one of them started walking in that direction. When we got back there he reached for a holes and I said sir that's not what I asked you for, he said what was it again I said a water pump so that's the experience I got from your business.< /text><time>1556066671700</time></record>

On the phone with Lowes customer service and I'm losing my mind. They set me up with an appointment with Hudson's appliance (not contracted with Lowes) so no one is coming to fix the brand new dryer that was purchased in March (havent even had it for 3 months) and doesnt work. We bought this dryer to replace the one lost during the campfire, along with out entire home. I took the entire day off work, which I really didnt want to do. AND IT WAS ALL A WASTE. I had to sit home ALL DAY because they couldnt provide me with ETA for a tech... and now it turns out, no one is even coming. So I havent been able to do laundry for 2+ weeks. The storm is coming in, I wont even be able to hang laundry outside to dry. I'm so mad I'm shaking.< /text>

Something I've noticed about the LOWES in Chico, they seem to find and hire the kindest most polite people Chico has to offer, I've never felt any other way while shopping there which has to be at least 30 times.</review>

I went in looking for a couple items which proved to be as challenging as finding competent assistance. When I finally found an employee, he gave me 3 isles to search, none of which were correct. I left and went to Home Depot, where the employee walked me to the first item and told me where the other item was, right down to how far down and which side of the Isle.</text>

The employees are the core strength of Lowe's, and they are out there on the floor every day actively seeking out customers in need. High five to the management team as well for a clean store, positive staff attitude, and consistent standards.< /Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>The staff are friendly! It seams like items I order arre in stock but they are stocked on the very top shelf and often behind tons of other stuff. The inventory system seems to stop tracking the item once the item arrivers at the store. I ordered a few ac units and they were placed behind a water pump and a hand full of generators. "We show 4 in the computer but we got to find em" It  seams to me all the heavy bulky items are placed up high behind tons of other items.   I
know customers get frustrated and leave give the staff a few minutes to get the item and be understanding when they say it may take a few hours because the staff may have to take 10 items down to get to one item in the back of the top shelp a few feet from the ceiling.</Review><UserId.>104330108929710491859<//UserId.>< user_name>

Better than alternatives in town. I usually opt for in store pickup and it generally is a smooth process. Most of the time staff are helpful if you can find someone.</review>

This stores costumer service is very poor. Me and my family had to haul 20 bags of mulch to our car, and had barely any help. We even asked the cashier if we could get some help and no one came until the end where the same cashier came out and put some of the last ones in our car.< /text>

I went to buy 5 gal of exterior paint for a storage shed. I was told the price was $144.00. When I got to check-out they informed me it was $176.00. I went back to the paint counter and was told "we were going to find you and tell you the difference but we didn't". I was in a hurry so I just paid the premium. The color was an exact match though.<//text>

I needed a new yard card so off i went. They are in the very back of the yard items. On other words quite a hike. Looked hopefully for help but could find nobody. This is quite common. Finally i gave that up and wrestled the cart out and pushed it all the way to cash registers. Im 75 and a heart patient so was huffing and puffing pretty good. I did ask for help loading into suv. Someone was called to do that. Thank you. Until they can staff better this will continue to be the norm. I really needed the cart or would have just left. Next time i will just leave. Try to do better lowes or you will lose sales.really.<//Review></record>

On 2 separate occasions my wife and I ordered appliances first a fridge then a dishwasher about a month apart. On both occasions they called and said it would be delivered early and I was obligated to give them a solid yes that I would be there to receive the appliances and on both occasions they never showed up, called after the fact to reschedule. Frist time my wife called and they appologized second time I called and demanded answers and the manager litterally told me "I don't know what happened sorry." DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS STORE IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME!<//Review>

<Review>I purchased a new commercial tru-infrared barbacuer and had the store assemble it.  The store needed two days to assemble.  After I picked up and brought it home I was showing it off to wife...then she pointed out all the finger prints, scratches, discoloration on the body from the stickers and the loose screws.  Upon further inspection I found missing nuts on the bolts.  I realise that instead of getting a newly assebled unit I either got a returned model or the  floor model which is the reason I requested a newly assembled unit. I'm very disappointed and will probably never shop here again. Now I know why the stock price on this company keeps going down and will keep going down.</Review><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808328977a43aa13:0xada171fbd02af7cd</GmapID>< Name>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>Was told that Lowes could send out a properly trained and equipped technician to install my water softener. He arrived late and said "I can't do that. I'm a fixture replacement tech, not a plumber." How lowes can offer install services when they don't use properly trained/equipped tradesmen is tantamount to criminal misrepresentation. If they don't use properly trained/insured/bonded professionals to do the work how can they "sell" us installation services?</Text><Rating>1</Rating></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1489113693118<//Time><rate>3< /rate><text>We bought our home 6 months ago and have been in so many projects. We find ourselves between lowes and homedepot all the time and prefer Lowe's hands down everytime EXCEPT in paint! They take forever to get to the counter and are rude and unhelpful. Last time I was here (because I'm currently waiting at the paint counter yet again) the two guys behind the counter were too busy with their bromance to answer questions, and had attitude when a woman in front of me and then myself asked for clarification.  Everytime their customer service is horrible at the paint counter.  Lowes get your paint people to a couple customer service classes
- a very unhappy 3 different people STILL waiting at your paint counter.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Hard to say but this may be the lesser of 2 evils.  I started coming here after repeated bad experiences trying to get employee assistance at Home Depot.

I got a few things and was trying to check out at 8:30 am on a weekend.  The only manned check out line with a light on was unmanned.  I waited there and nobody ever showed up.  So, I went to the self check out and ran into some problems with "unchecked item in bagging area" and then "you have removed an item from the bagging area".  So, I tried to get help from the self check out attendant but she was on the phone and remained that way for several minutes.  Eventually, I was checked out by a girl who cared very little that I had been bouncing between check out lines trying just to give them my money and get out of the store.  I should mention also that I was the only person trying to check out at the time (store was very slow).<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Hard to say but this may be the lesser of 2 evils.  I started coming here after repeated bad experiences trying to get employee assistance at Home Depot.

I got a few things and was trying to check out at 8:30 am on a weekend.  The only manned check out line with a light on was unmanned.  I waited there and nobody ever showed up.  So, I went to the self check out and ran into some problems with "unchecked item in bagging area" and then "you have removed an item from the bagging area".  So, I tried to get help from the self check out attendant but she was on the phone and remained that way for several minutes.  Eventually, I was checked out by a girl who cared very little that I had been bouncing between check out lines trying just to give them my money and get out of the store.  I should mention also that I was the only person trying to check out at the time (store was very slow).< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Phone tree nightmare. Tried to get lumber department which did not answer. The call went back to customer service which then gave a busy signal. Hang up, repeat, hang up, repeat. etc.. I disdain all of the big box stores. I really miss local lumber yards.<//Review></record>

The phone system doesn't work when you call them, the clerks hide when you are attempting to chase them down to ask a question and they mumble when they speak.  It's time the manager had a team meeting to straighten this store out.  It's awful and has been for a few years now.</Review></record>

Asked for help in ceiling fan department. Apparently only one person could help us and he was on break. Was told he would be there in 7 minutes, but never showed up. Not impressed.< /text>

The employees don't know where anything is and too lazy to show you, the cashier was super rude and trying to push me out the door so she could continue chatting with her coworker, and they are the most expensive hardware store in Chico.< /Review>

No one to help me find sprinkler parts. Tried to use a store credit and couldn't because it was in my wife's driver's licence. How dumb.</text>

the customer service at the Chico store is nonexistent.  The phone system doesn't work when you call them, the clerks hide when you are attempting to chase them down to ask a question and they mumble when they speak.  It's time the manager had a team meeting to straighten this store out.  It's awful and has been for a few years now.< /text>
