Dr. Yang is a wonderful veterinarian. We have taken our dog to him for multiple health conditions and surgeries and he has continued to provide excellent care. What we appreciate most is that he regularly checks in the next few days after a visit to verify that our dog is feeling better.< /review>

We've been going to Thornhill Pet for over ten years now. Even though we've moved away from Oakland, there's no way we'd entrust the care of our beloved pets to anyone other than Dr Yang - he is an amazing, hard-working, knowledgeable and caring vet. Can't imagine finding a better vet!</text>

We have 6 dogs, all rescues. Dr. Yang has been a rock in our lives for almost 10 years!! from puppy shots, surgeries to heart meds for our oldest guy and everything else in-between. I would not trust another vet but Dr. Yang. His team- Alicia, Kristina & Oscar always accommodates us (aka "the zoo") sometimes all 6 at a time!! They are like family to us!! Your pets could not be in better hands!!</Review>

Dr. Yang is the most reliable and compassionate vet I could have ever asked for! He has always been very clear when describing my 13 year old’s conditions. I feel like he prepares me, so that I can better understand what my dog is going through. Dr. Yang is such a great ally to have if you truly care about your pet!

Everyone at Thornhill Pet Hospital truly cares for every animal they see. Thank you so much for everything! I wish I could move you guys to Denver with me.< /review>

When our young cat unexpectedly passed away from a heart attack, I rushed to the vet hoping they could revive her (I realize now how unlikely that would have been). Dr. Yang quickly and compassionately assessed our cat, and he demonstrated so much empathy and gentleness around the entire situation. It should also be mentioned that during the Covid19 Shelter in Place, they quickly came up with a safe way to continue seeing pets for checkups. Everything is so easy, calm, and professional with Dr. Yang and the Thornhill Pet Hospital--it is a caring and empathetic environment to boot.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoE-b6bW1SGuc-sUsxMUb7Jkctl9rTRnQEv1Re=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

<Review>Dr. Yang, Alicia, and the rest of the crew at Thornhill Pet Hospital are attentive and thorough with my cat Beau's health needs.  While other vets I went to in the past were overly thorough (e.g., multiple expensive ultrasounds that didn't help), Dr. Yang does a good cost/benefit analysis, with a good dose of compassion added. My only complaint is that Dr. Yang is too busy, so there may be a delay in getting a response from him, but that is understandable.< /Review><user>109150064110055342118< /user>< rate>

I have had a number of vets and emergency vets over the years and Dr. Yang and his staff have consistently provided solid service.

At Thornhill Pet Hospital you don't get pushed into buying extra procedures or special foods and supplements. He reminds me of the country vet that I went to when I lived in Northern CA. They Let you know when something is outside of their scope (specialty surgery) but they are they general practitioners that can make the difference in the quality of life of your loved pets.

Dr. Yang has helped lots of folks that rescue animals. Pre-COVID I would see them in the lobby with the animals. I am no different.  I rescued one dog that needed aggressive skin cancer tumors removed and was underweight and ill from lack of food and horrible fleas. Dr, Yang removed several of the worst of the tumors getting clear margins and predicted that the dog would live just six months. 18 months later she needed more tumors removed and he said that it had to be her last surgery as she was old, frail and now how some scar tissue making surgery more difficult. Well, she is alive another 18 months later and frailer but happy and enjoying life.

Go ahead and get an appointment with this vet for your pet and know that you are doing right by them.</Text>

<Text>If you're looking for an honest, kind, and knowledgeable vet, look no further than Dr. Yang! He is a true professional who genuinely cares about the animals he treats. My two 100+ lb dogs are new to Thornhill after their 8-year vet in San Ramon relocated (yes, I would commute to San Ramon from Oakland as I refused to continue seeing Montclair Vet...read RIP off). I wish I would've known about Thornhill & Dr. Yang sooner as I've had the best vet experience with them in six months than I have in the last 8 years with other vets.

<review>We have entrusted our pets to Dr. Carlos Yang and the excellent supporting staff at Thornhill Pet Hospital for several years. Dr. Yang and the Practice Manager, Alicia Halperin, provide all the vital services of a well qualified primary veterinary clinic. In the past year the clinic has undergone significant upgrades, expansion, and new construction in which to provide veterinary services. The entire team is committed to treat their pets and owners with kindness and compassion.
Thornhill Pet Hospital is also well connected in the Bay Area veterinary community, and the team can provide helpful local referrals for cases requiring specialized treatment.
My family and I recommend Thornhill Pet Hospital unreservedly for professional and compassionate veterinary care.< /review>< UserId.>

Dr. Yang is an excellent doctor he is great with communicating, gives great advice, and answers any question you have big or small.

We love Dr. Yang. He is kind, practical and communicates clearly. He has returned phone calls on the weekends and evenings on several occasions. During the Shelter in Place, he "diagnosed" an infection in one of our cats over the phone and came in on the weekend to get him started on antibiotics right away.

My previous vet of only a year retired and Dr. Yang was recommended.
I'm so happy for the change. My previous vet couldn't figure out problems with my cat and would say take him to an emergency hospital.  Not very helpful.  Since then we tried one remedy but that didn't solve his losing weight problem so after a litany of tests his real problem was discovered.  Although the cure is a one time 2k cost at another facility it will be worth it to have my kitty back to normal and healthy again!

You can tell everyone at TPH has a real interest in your pet and cares not like some other vet offices where it is just a job to them and the more they charge the better.

Not sure why I'm reviewing TPH because the last I heard they weren't taking anymore pets but maybe they have since expanded.< /review>

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Thornhill Pet Hospital has put together a very efficient procedure for dropping off our dog.  We called ahead, drove up to the driveway, dropped off our dog and picked him up after the shots.  We really appreciate the care by Dr. Yang and Alicia.  They took good care of our dog and we love them.<//Review>

I've been going to Thornhill Pet Hospital for several years now and have been nothing but happy with the service I've received. Alicia and the front office staff has always been friendly, helpful, and eager to make the short wait enjoyable.  Dr. Yang is a wonderful doctor because of his kind nature and ability to make even the most complex problems easy to understand. I appreciate the time he spends discussing what is going on with my dogs, my options, and what he would personally do. I'd much rather travel the distance for such great veterinary care because seeing this wonderful staff is like visiting with good friends.</text>

Alicia has always gone above and beyond in creating health certificates for my dog to travel with me, often researching requirements for different countries.  Dr. Yang calls to check on how Enzo is feeling after teeth cleaning or any procedure.  This is a family run business and they are all very invested in providing quality care for your pet.<//review>< time>

We’ve been bringing our golden doodle to Dr. Yang for years. They’re efficient, helpful and kind and our pup is always eager to drag us in the door whenever we visit.  Dr. Yang listens to our concerns, patiently describes his diagnoses and different options to address any issues, and I always feel like he tries to suggest a cost effective option for families. For example, our pup had allergic reaction that required prescription shampoo for a few days and when we mentioned that we had some left, but from years before, Dr Yang suggested we check the date on the shampoo, let us know how much time past the written expiration date that we could still expect the effectiveness to be acceptable, and only purchase additional shampoo if the older one was no longer serviceable.< /text>

Dr. Yang and his staff are so caring and professional.  I recently had a sick cat and they let me bring him in in the morning before I left for work.  Dr. Yang called me at work to give me an update and in the afternoon when I picked my cat up Dr. Yang spent more time going over his findings and answering my questions.  When you're worried about your beloved pet, it's so wonderful to know you have experts to give you support.</text>

I've been taking my cats to Thornhill Vet for a few years now and am very happy with the service. My most recent visit with my cat Ozzy when he was very sick and had not had anything to drink or eat for a few days was pretty scary. Thornhill let me drop Ozzy off for the day so that Dr. Yang could examine / treat him during the day despite his already full schedule. I picked Ozzy up at the end of the day with a treatment plan in place and Ozzy already feeling a little better. In just a few days Ozzy is back to his ole self. I appreciated Dr. Yang calling me at 8pm at night the following night to see how Ozzy was doing. Thornhill Pet, Dr. Yang and staff are terrific and really do care!<//Text>

< review>
EVERYONE here is very kind and welcoming.  They're all knowledgeable about treatments, not just the vets and vet techs!  Best of all, vets can often say your pet NEEDS some kind of treatment or can make expensive recommendations.  Here, they just tell you what your pet must have and don't try to take you for a ride or view you as a cash cow (I want my dog and cat healthy, but I don't want to be pressured into things that may or may not be necessary!).  I highly recommend Thornhill!  I also have 2 more difficult breeds and they are not only accommodating, but super kind and my pets love the staff here.</review>

Dr. Yang saved my dog's life!!

We brought our dog Boo into Dr. Yang's office because we thought she might have an ear infection. After he fixed up her ears, he decided to do a routine check-up since she was already there and found a lump that was very concerning to him.

We immediately took Boo into a specialist, and they informed us she had two tumors ready to burst on her spleen. They got her into surgery that day. The surgeon told us that if we had waited even a week more, she would likely be dead or in very bad shape from the tumors bursting.

Without Dr. Yang's thorough examination and dedication to the well-being of his patients we could have lost our little girl.

THANK YOU SO MUCH TO DR. YANG AND HIS STAFF.<//review>

We just went to our pibull Luna's annual exam. She loves going into the clinic. We were happy that the room was clear and calm; the remodeled space has upped the comfort level for her. Luna loves Alicia's voice, so this was another good distraction for her. Luna really likes Dr. Yang. She knew him immediately, he is kind, moved in respectfully and confidently. As a rescue-gal, positive handling like this helps feed Luna's confidence with other who handle her. It was a good visit. Dr. Yang was very helpful and kind in the treatment of a past pitty who had cancer, and with Luna, detecting her torn ACL and dental issues when she joined our family.</text>

I have three animals,2 cats and a 2 year old dog.  I changed to Thornhill Pet Hospital appx. 3 years ago,as my Vet was retiring.  It soon after became time to put my dog to rest.  Dr. Yang was so attentive and kind,gentle and caring to both my family and my dog in the way he approached this devastating situation.
Since then we adopted a new puppy and have had out cats to Dr. Yang for various things.

The staff both upfront and behind the scenes along with Dr. Yang are always most helpful,wether it is answering a question or fitting us in their busy schedule .  I never hesitate to recommend Thornhill Pet
when someone is in need of a Veterinarian.</review>

Best vet practice I've ever been to.  Dr. Yang is very thorough, calm and takes the time to explain things well.  He has even called me after office hours in response to questions.  The rest of the staff (go Alicia and Vicky!) are great, super nice and helpful.  They will even file your pet insurance claims for you which is really nice.  The prices here are good, I would say below average for the Bay Area.  They try to give you discounts on care/meds whenever possible also.  I would pay more and be no less happy, especially when you consider the state of veterinary care today - very overworked and underpaid.  Pet health care costs have been rising along with human health costs due to many similar reasons: new technology, high cost of drugs and high education costs/debt loads for providers among other reasons, but vets make significantly less money than human physicians.  The level of service provided by Thornhill is even more impressive when you take that into account with their good prices.

And I'll also put in a plug for pet insurance:  If for no other reason than if, like me, you don't ever want to be put in a position where you have to take money into account when deciding on your pet's medical care<//text>

Made an appointment several days in advance.  Arrive on time.  Front desk lets me know they are running 30 minutes behind.  They ask me to wait in my car (on a hot and sunny day) because I brought my dog in with concerns about upper respiratory infection and thought it might be kennel cough.  The doctor makes it out to my car and does the exam out of my trunk.  Decides nothing is wrong with my dog even though he is actively struggling breathing.  Charges me $65 and provides no guidance.  Please go see a different vet.  This was a huge waste of money and time.</Review>

< Review>
Both the doctor and the stuff are ok at most circumstances. However, the reasons that I only give three stars are:

- The services in general is not as good as other vet clinics in the same neighborhood. It shows in many small places - the promised followup about test results went to nowhere; online appointment didn't get any response; no one answered the phone during business hours...
- Lack of medical records. When I got the subscribed meds, there was no detailed explanation, neither any medical record that I can easily access and refer.

Have visited twice but will change to another clinic.</Review>

<review>I took my kitty to be spayed here and they did such a great job with her! Her surgery scar was very small and it's almost gone now. The surgeon did such a great job compared to the one at VCA where I took my other kitty because there was no more space at Thornhill. My kitty from VCA was in so much pain and I looked at her scar and it was so crooked instead of a straight line, I don't know why but who ever spayed her did a terrible job.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1519677090058, 'text': "Alexis, it's immensely heartening to know that you hold our staff in such high esteem. It's so wonderful to know that your experience with getting your kitty spayed was such a positive one! Thank you for sharing, and we hope you won't hesitate to reach out if you ever need anything else again!"}<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

It was an awesome experience as the cashier was very nice and considerate during my shopping there. And they had the best prices on regular and exclusive figures that I don't usually see at other figure and toy stores. I highly recommend it for any figure collectors (Marvel Legends, Robot Spirits, Nendroid, S.H Figurearts, etc)<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I wish I could give this place 10 stars. It is a really nice toy shop! The store is a bit small but their prices are really good and fair. Got 2 Black series figures (Wolfe and a phase 1 clone trooper) for only $23 each, nib. Not bad at all. They have a lot of imports, black series, Marvel legends, Dc multiverse, etc. Will come back again</Text>< Pics>

This place is awesome. They have a great selection of collectibles and toys. The prices are awesome! I've bought things at twice the price from online stores or places like at Frank N' Son's just to find out, this was the place to come in the first place. The staff are friendly and I can't recommend this place enough. Love coming here.< /text>

<Name>The Imperial Academy</Name><Text>I been here twice, and both of the times I came out with figures that I wanted and without over paying.

For 2 star wars figures and 1 Neca figure I spent around $60. If you are in the neighborhood stop by or just go!

You do need to make an appointment first and park in the back because of the Covid situation.

I will return again..< /Text><time>1593311359607</time><rating>5< /rating>< resp>

I stopped by today (9-22-18) after seeing them advertised on offer up, and found some great toys with amazing prices. For the longest time I was not able to find the Star Wars Blackseries Darth Revan and I did not want to pay more the $25.

Needless to say I found my Darth Revan For $19.99 and I couldnt be any happier. They have great stuff Marvel, star wars, Transformers etc... Give them a look because I will be going back.</Text>

Took our ph# down but never texted us to let us know our order was done.  We sat in their pkg lot for a long while, so decided to ck.  It seemed as if our order had been sitting on their shelf for quite some time so our pizza & wings were no longer hot.  ☹< /Text>

<username>Juan M Contreras<//username><Text>Really bad service, I asked for the specials and the guy at the front said "we don't have any specials" so I paid $23 for a large pizza, then I checked online and I found the same pizza for $7.99, he didn't want to apply the coupon and refused to cancel the order because it was "almost done" really???.

I had no option because I was starving and most of the restaurants were closed due to the holiday 😒< /Text>< GmapID>

I was upset because they were out of crushed red pepper today, but the pizza more than made up for it. Gorgeous pizza, very well executed. I got the Brooklyn thin crust and it was really nice pizza!<//Text>

Easily the worst Domino's experience I've ever had. My food was three hours late, cold, and not what I ordered. The store also never picked up the phone - I called NINE times. I will NEVER order from this store again.<//review>

My third order from this location will be my last.

On each occasion, the delivery came with the incorrect items - addressed to an entirely different person/order - and unreasonably late.

Food was cold.

Their drivers don't try to find your apartment and will ask you to meet them at their car/wherever they're parked.

Poor customer service; the people answering the phone at the restaurant are impolite and seemingly annoyed by you inquiring about your order, and especially when you let them know they made a small mistake.

This last order (July 25, 2020), the driver came back 20 minutes after dropping it off once he realized he'd delivered the wrong order, asking me to give him the food back in exchange for my correct order! During COVID-19 lockdown, he insisted I give him the food back which had already been on my dinner table so he could deliver it to its intended customer. Completely unacceptable.

Stay away from this place.< /Text>

Surprisingly excellent pizza from a Domino's. It's consistently good, not too greasy, and their sauce is one of the best Ive had locally in a long time.

(I'm serious!)

These guys are great pizza men.< /review>

We are currently waiting for the pizza we ordered roughly 2 hours ago. I'm sure when we finally receive it, it will be deserving of the review score I've given.

Update: it's been over a month now and the Domino's manager who was supposed to resolve this issue hasn't reached out to us once. This location has soured my opinion on the company as a whole.< /Text>

It's a fine Domino's, nothing bad or unexpected. Pro tip for carryout, though: order it online, because in-store they are more focused on making food than taking orders!</Text>

<review>This Dominoes consistently has poor customer service.  The employees at this location are impolite and inconsiderate.  They wouldn't take a phone order when they were busy. Moreover, if you give them cash and a gift card together, the cashier will take your cash and charge the gift card second, which doesnt make any sense at all.

Dominoes needs to retrain this location or shut it down.

If you are looking for good pizza and a good customer experience, try Little Caesars on El Camino, Spot in downtown Los Altos, State of Mind also in downtown Los Altos, or Napoletana Pizzeria in Mountain View.

I applauded Dominoes when they came out with their garlic crust pizza.  However, changing their product and extensive marketing cannot save this business from a poor customer experience.  They can't insure my pizza if they won't even take my order.  I will no longer be a customer, especially at this location.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Ordered delivery from them and
- the "tracker" outright lied and said my food was delivered when it was not.
- the delivery driver did not follow my instructions.
- the food was late, stone cold, and inedible.
- when i called to complain, i was put on hold, and then hung up on.

worst customer service i have ever had with a business.< /review>

<Text>Pretty good when your order is correct.
However.
When it is not correct and you call to address the issue, the manager will argue with you about whatever the issue is.

My pizza was sent to me with no sauce when I ordered extra sauce. I called to tell them to give me a credit for my next order, and the manager kept talking over me repeatedly saying that they don’t make pizza without sauce.

I was more than irritated by this person telling me that the pizza I am looking at has sauce when it clearly had only cheese and meats on it.< /Text>< Pictures>

Pizza is always good here, just make sure you check that they give you the right pizza because they have mixed up my orders in the past especially delivery orders. If you want plates, napkins, red pepper flakes or cheese you will need to ask. Customer service is great most of the time.</review>

Terrible customer service and some r very rude. It’s over an hour wait just get cold , under cooked, and not fresh ingredients. Some of the workers also don’t know how to take an order. They lag for a good while. The only good thing bout dominos is to scan any pizza and get points but it takes 48 just to go to ur points reward thing. There’s been numerous times I ordered and have found hair on my order. This place needs to either improve or get shut down< /text>

I placed an order which included a free pizza at 8:48pm on Saturday and the confirmation email said it would arrive within 40-50 minutes. After waiting for an hour, I called the store and spoke to Ritesh. He told me it would be another 30-40 minute wait because they had 15 order ahead of mine for delivery. After talking over each other (arguing) I asked a rhetorical question (when am I going to eat then? At midnight?) and he answered "that's not my problem". I asked for a refund and he informed me they could not cancel the order and refund the free pizza along with the other items I purchased. I had to pay for an UBER to get there and back just to pick up my pizzas that I paid for to get delivered. HORRIBLE customer service and truly a bad image for Dominos overall.< /text>

Why 3 stars and not 5? Oh it’s simple. Cos you’ll lie.
I ordered pizza to the hotel I’m staying in. I called the store to find out when my pizza will be delivered as the dominos tracker says the driver left with the pizza. The guy on phone says “there is a lot of traffic and driver is stuck in traffic. It will take 20-30 minutes”. Right after the call, within a minute, I get my pizza delivered at the door.</review>

The quality is consistent for the actual food, but the customer service is well below average. I've had multiple times where the phone order is inaccurate because the phone operator was too impatient to get off the phone, missing part of the order. Then, when I arrive, I have to wait for part of my order to be cooked.</review>

Wish I had read reviews before ordering. Only gave 1 star because it won't take less. Distance between store & my delivery address should have taken no longer than 15 minutes. From the time it said the driver left for delivery to my door was 30 minutes. FOOD WAS COLD!!  I will not order from Dominoes again. And I will definitely NOT recommend it to anyone.</review>

Usually I would be the first to slam Domino's and everything they stand for, however things have changed with this place. The food has improved quite a bit this past year and the menu has expanded in a good way. While the beverage selection remains poor their pizza has become quite good. Domino's always had good delivery service, but now they have good pizza as well. I used to feel sick, bloated, and toxic after consuming anything made by Domino's. The quality of the ingredients was bad. They have changed that and it now seems like actual food fit for humans. This is not a high end pizza or an Italian cuisine restaurant by an means, but if you want a decent pizza delivered for a fair price you can now trust them to come through. 7 out of 10</review>

Terrible service. I waited almost two hours for delivery and called 4 times. The first time the worker said the pizza was on the way and would let me know. The second time she said she would call me back but never did. They then started to not pick up my calls until i used a different number, where i found it the pizza was never made.</Text>

<Text>Only 30 minutes for lunch, I check the tracking app and it says it's good for pickup. I drive over and he just started making my order and said it would be "10 more minutes". 20 minutes later my order is done and my lunch is over and I get back late with no time to eat.

I don't understand what the issue is but they need to fix it< /Text></record>

<review>Up till this point, I would have given 4.5 stars for quality and consistency, however drops down to 2 as the owner has decided that because of the minimum wage increase, he had to grossly increase prices and eliminate the longstanding $5.99 deal. I'm sorry to say, but you've lost a customer... just gonna make the drive down the road to the Sunnyvale location.< /review>< user>

< Review>
Absolutely worst delivery experience I’ve ever had (and awful dominos as well). Delivery came in an hour fifteen missing half my order. Didn’t get the other half until 2.5 hours after I placed my order. The driver was nice though and apologized.

The cheesy bread was inedible (undercooked, cheese wasn’t melted, made me feel sick), and I’ve had Dominos cheesy bread all over the US. Furthermore, no one would answer the phone when I called for help. Mona (the manager) was incredibly unhelpful the one time she answered the phone.

Awful service, and awful food.<//Review>

<Text>Terrible customer service! After waiting 30 minutes for my carry out order, the attendant brazenly told me to come back in 40 minutes since he did not even start my order yet. When I protested he brazenly told me to call corporate. Stay away from this place! I sure won't be coming here again.< /Text>< name>

Worst Domino's store you could ever find customer service sucks pizza two hours late and then don't even offer to compensate you in any way.  Run far and run fast from this place Mountain Mike's is a lot easier to order from hell baking pizza at home is better.</Review>

Decent value and they can make a true thin crust  - like a cracker, if you know what good east coast pizza is all about. Delivery was within 40 minutes from ordering, it's tasty and while not a knockout, we'll use them again occasionally. Havent' tried the chicken yet but looking in the box, it's a lot less than I expected, volume wise. Oh well.</review>

<Name>SWIM<//Name><Review>Ordered a 2 item delivery that never came, and there was no communication from either text or call.

Called customer service and supposedly these guys are a franchise business that function independently for transactions, therefore the business line cannot help me with returning the credit payment made online. Get delivery somewhere else, don't even bother.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< rate>

Although costumer service was really accepting of my request of my pizza, the actual food was disgusting. My green peppers, and pepperonis were burnt. The crust was lopsided  and burnt as well, and the overall flavor of the pizza was just extremely distasteful.

Sounds like a 1 star rating if you ask me, so you're probably wondering why it has 2 stars. Simply because it was the only fast food place open at 10pm, and also because the only worker in there was very understanding.<//Review>

<Review>I have been ordering from this Dominos for years and I have had issues that were resolved in the past and due to customer service I was always willing to just let little things go but yesterday even the customer service was lacking by both, delivery driver and shift manager and because of this I had to drive down in person to talk with the manager who was way more comprehending and very pleasant to talk with unlike the rude obnoxious shift manager who handled my complaint by phone!
The manager was very apologetic and kept offering me something for my troubles to which I politely refused and stated that he had already given me what I wanted and that was him listening to me and being willing to better train his employees on how to defuse tough situations instead of making them worse as well as teach them the importance of treating their customers with respect being that we are the ones who actually pay their checks in the long run.
I went there personally to inform them that I would be giving them one more chance.
Keep in mind that I still tipped the rude driver and paid total 60.00 and didn't even eat anything because of how rudely I was treated by both shift manager and driver!
My husband however ate 2 slices and didn't finish the 2nd because he said he upset his stomach!
I don't mind sacrificing quality of food if there's excellent service but I shouldn't and won't sacrifice service and quality!
I honestly hope they get it together because if I am ever treated in such manner again I don't plan on sitting back with my arms crossed and will do whatever needs to be done to reach someone very high up in the ladder!
I only hope it never comes to that!
To the manger who was attentive,  polite and apologetic,  THANK YOU!< /Review>< Pictures>

- Pizza was ready when promised.
- It was cheap with the 50% off promo.

THUMBS DOWN:
- One of the toppings selectable on the web site wasn't available at the pickup location, which I only learned about after ordering and paying
- The tracker didn't work (didn't text me that pizza was ready to pick up)
- PIzza tasted really lousy.  I requested extra sauce, but the only reason I know that this happened was because the pizza was terribly soggy and falling apart, not crisp in the least. Ironically, this was the "Robust Inspired Tomato Sauce"... which was not robust, definitely not inspired, and didn't seem very tomato'y.

Not ordering Dominos again in the foreseeable future.  Threw out most of the pizza; not worth it even for free :-(.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808fb0c88953a6d5:0x9e6a9d21e00c0049</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

At beginning of January 2018 I went in to pick up an order that I made online. I been going to this dominos for a couple years and most employees know me. This man was newvi guess ,he said he couldn't find my order . Ok I do make mistakes sometime ... So I checked my phone and yes I had ordered at the wrong location. So I told this guy I wanted that order here not 20 miles away. So let's all think ...what actions could a good employee take to provide excellent service. . Yes, call other location,cancel the order and ask if I wanted to make any changes and if not her just transfer the order to that store.well he didn't do any of those things, he did nothing but say I'd have to drive the 20 miles to get it. Not!!! So then I told him I wanted the order placed there he added it up and came to a price much higher than it should have been. When I mentioned the correct price, the coupon online and since I had been having such difficulty connecting to the internet outside the store I asked him if I still needed to re-enter the order online to get the coupon price ND he said that was the coupon price... SO HERES<//Review>

Took 15 minutes of continuous dialing to get them on the line. Absolutely horrible customer service. When I finally got ahold of them, I asked what their specials for today were and they said we have no specials, you have to go online for the specials. Immediately hung up on them and decided to never call back again. I've never seen that before. Absolutely insane!<//review>

An hour and fifteen minute wait, cold pizza, no customer service. What else can be said that hasn't already. Just drive to Trader Joes and buy a frozen, or die starving, still better than this "food." I have a free pizza and refuse to order from them again, thats how bad they are. Its this specific location. Owner is running this place like Trump is running the country, into the wall.< /Review>

<Review>Absolutely HORRIBLE.  Do NOT order from this store.  It is a franchise store (not corporate owned).  They took 40 minutes just to START my order and do not answer their telephone.   Corporate Dominos couldn't even get in contact with them.

I ordered at 11:53PM they said they never received the order till 12:30AM which is 35 minutes after. Then I received my delivery at 1:40AM. I wanted to cancel my order but they dominos rep refused to cancel. And from 1:15AM the rep told me the driver is 5 minutes away, NEVER ARRIVED till 1:40AM.

Pizza was cold, parmesan bites were dry.

Then the manager spoke to me the next day, apologized and said he would issue me a refund and then never spoke to me after again. I never received a refund it is now been 25 days and I have no update. Whenever I call them they say the manager is not here.

PLEASE DON'T order here cause you guys will surely regret it.</Text>< user_name>

When I called back to order for pickup no one would answer the phone.  After several attempts (a combined total of about 15 minutes with the phone ringing), I gave up. This is horrible customer service as well as FALSE ADVERTISING!< /Text><Rating>1</Rating>< userid>

<review>Stay away. They said they did not receive my online order and would not honor the $7.99 special. When I return to work the website showed my order was in prep and then in bake for the address I went to. This location sucks.</review>< Pictures>

I like dominos but this store is terrible. This is the review from multiple orders I have places online in last few months. I use dominos tracker to track the order.
These people bluff on the tracker (always) about the status to make it look good to the dominos company. There are times when the order sits in quality check for 30 mins!
Multiple times it shows online that Pizza is delivered at this time but the order arrives like 15-30 mins after that! Bluff bluff and bluff!< /review>

<Text>Great experience! Good food with lots of choices and plenty of beverage options to choose from. Will definitely be coming back here to try more of their menu. I had their tortilla soup and it was hardy with just the right amount of spice.

<Text>Always a good time. The atmosphere feels very neighborhood friendly and the service is great.

<user_name>Julia Bu< /user_name><date>1614449462271<//date><Rate>5</Rate><review>Was looking for a brewery that served food for a Friday evening night out. A lot of places don't do reservations, so on a whim picked this one. So glad I stumbled upon it.

Service was great, was seated quickly. Food came out amazingly fast. Tables were well spaced out and not crowded for COVID times. Lots of beer on tap from own brewery and as well as local favorites.

<text>Amazing ambiance! I have to say out of all the many places I visited on my trip to San Diego last month, this one by far had the coolest aesthetic to it. Located conveniently right down the block from the hotel I stayed at, it was just a couple minute stroll to enjoy great beer on tap and awesome food. Two thumbs up, cheers!< /text>< Pics>

I usually hit the OG PB TAP ROOM.
So this review is for the NP location.
Honestly, during last (COVID Lockdown) outdoor period, the service was actually better than now. They may be understaffed as the Government checks keeps flowing out...
But not being political here.
The service is average at best, in fact we complimented the bus boy more than our server bc he was way more attentive.
If it were not their decent line up of beers on tap, one-two star deserved.
Wish LIVEWIRE opens back up soon!<//Text>

We're disappointed to hear that our level of service did not live up to TapRoom's high standards that we strive to maintain.  You are not entirely wrong in the case of being understaffed, as you know that we are not the only small business struggling with hiring right now.\nRegardless, we failed to make your experience a delight and for missing that mark, we sincerely apologize.  We truly appreciate your candor and support over the years.  We hope that on the other side of this temporary hump, you'll give us another chance to make it up to you.  Here's to an awesome summer!\nThank you,\nSD TapRoom Management"}</response>< gmap_id>

Food, excellent. Beer, excellent. Ambiance, excellent. Service, excellent. I have never been disappointed. Had brunch this morning and it was wonderful. Micaela was my server.

We really enjoyed the food offerings and they have an extensive beer selection as their name implies.  My only knock would be no kids menus so if you bring young ones expect to pay as though they are adults.  That said, at least they will have leftovers for later!<//review>

The food is amazing. The truffle fries and the dip that comes with them were yummy! I had the seared yellowfin tuna salad it was delish! We didn't have any alcohol but the beer selection is quite large. Nice location and nice inside!!</review>

The people here are super friendly and helpful. Its pretty basic food but the beer list is pretty intimidating. They offer testers which is great. Outdoor seating is really nice but the inside looks great too. Can't wait for the day we can sit inside again<//text>

Lobster Mac n cheese is the bomb! Nice booths outside, with heaters. Staff were super friendly. Only 4 stars 'cos the speakers (right above our table) was super loud. In their defense it was a game night, and a final at that. Not their fault that we weren't interested in the game!!<//review>

< review>
The Tap room is great, it's walking distance  from my Florida Street home and the beer selection is huge. Outdoor seating is plentiful and the food is too good for a bar, brunch is excellent. They doo fill growlers, which can sometimes bee a bit expensive. However, Wednesdays are 40 percent off.</review>

Perfect meal selection to go with extremely well made house and guest beers. A no-brainer for any day or night of the week. Also, outdoor, partitioned dining for a safe experience.<//Review>

So many options to choose from, but definitely worth the wait! The green hot dog was pretty appealing! And the taste really followed it! They have a huge selection of hot sauces to choose from too!<//Text>

No hard liquor here, but they do have a good selection of beer, wine, and a sweet pineapple hard cider that I enjoyed 2 glasses of. Cute atmosphere and friendly staff. We walked in on their Tuesday trivia night that was quite entertaining.<//text>

Our server Sara(h) was awesome! I moved to San Diego in January, and this was the best burger I've had here so far. Beer was great, reminded me of Portland and their many amazing breweries. Will be returning for sure!

Ps. My aunt and cousin made me finish the flight they bought and I'm writing this in the car right now.</Review>

<text>A friend shared a photo of a special (spicy turkey melt) and I immediately wanted to try it. We ordered two and were not disappointed, one of the best turkey melts I've had in awhile.  They have a friendly, efficient curbside pickup, even sterilized pens for signing your credit slip!  The patio is shaping up nicely, will be a nice place to sit once restaurants can open their dining areas again.</text>< Pics>

Absolutely love this place. Only moved to SD a month ago and I've been back around 7 times.

Ive tried every burger on the menu and they are all excellently juicy!

The truffle fries and BBQ cauliflore are amazing. My friend highly recommendeds the ceasar salad to any salad lover.

I'm a big craft beer fan and most of the house beers are good. Some arent my taste, but they experiment with bold flavors here. I'd recommend trying a flight. The guest brews are good as well. The servers are really good at recommendations</text>

Great guys.  We wanted to start a family tradition of picking up some gold coins on birthdays, to teach my kid about investing/saving/collecting.  I thought there would be a premium for buying at brick and mortar stores but I was really surprised.  They beat all online retailers (pretty significantly too considering margins on bullion is pretty slim).  We will be back.<//Text>

<review>This is a wonderful place to find and learn about rare coins. My son just got very interested in coins, so took him there (2nd visit)  few days ago.Tom was so helpful, he took time off to talk to my son, explain different coins and why some are expensive and some are not, what to look for when selecting coins.

He also gave him a red book and few coins as a gift. Such a warm and wonderful place. Definitely recommend and we will be visiting again.< /review><response>{'time': 1567111105809, 'text': 'Thank you very much for the kind review!!

I just want to start off by saying this place is awesome, they have great staff super knowledgeable and friendly. This is my new go to place for buying and selling gold/silver coins & bullion. I’m not lying when I say this shop has some of the best prices in town. I will definitely be back many more times.<//text>

I am very new to the coin world. More specifically speaking. Sliver, I bought some from a private party and was really unsure of what I had. So, with many questions, I decided to go to my local coin shop which landed me here. Man was I impressed. The guys were very nice and very honest. They assured me that what I bought was actually good and that I did well on my purchase. They most definitely gained a loyal customer. Can’t wait to do future business with them!</Review>

<Review>Rude service for no apparent reason. Didn't even bother giving me a price for my 2020 W 1 oz. American gold eagle or End of WW2 1/2 oz 24k gold coin.. I was willing to sell reasonably lower just due to life circumstances at the moment. He just quickly shoved me right back out the door, not literally.. but he didn't even bother to ask me to have a look around or ask me what other coins I had in the box that I brought in with me, or if there's anything else I needed help with.. it's awkward being somewhere you're not wanted, but I took a quick peek around anyways.. they do have a nice selection from what I saw, I'll give them that, because I'm not a hater.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80dbff9a5317b2b1:0x50d691289b4a92fe</Gmap_id><time>1618961638292</time>< Resp>

They also have copious amounts of silver and gold for the investors. The proprietor is awesome! Well knowledgeable and he actually seemed interested in my collection and gave great advice.

Hello fellow metal consumers ... I would like to say a couple of great words about this well known shop.. first they are very kind friendly and knowledgeable about metals.. I have purchased metals from them and also sold to them.. both experiences were fast reliable and done professionally.. Jeff is a great man to buy from.  And Chad in the right time, might give you a great deal .. if buying.. !  Anyway I'll be doing alot of business with them and I suggest you do too.< /Text>

I brought in coins that I collected over the years and the two gentlemen that helped me were friendly and knowledgeable.  They were able to look up foreign coins for me and tell me a little history of them.  Not intimidating at all.   I will definitely come back in the future.< /text>

Had a great experience in the shop today. I know nothing about coins but needed to cash out a collection from my father in laws estate. I left the shop knowing more about coins than I could have hoped and felt very comfortable with the transaction. There was no pressure to buy or sell and I leaned so much. I highly recommend visiting this establishment if you are in the same situation I was in, you will leave feeling you got a fair deal. Thanks again for all the help.< /text>

<review>I have never been so embarrassed in my entire life. First of all I was waiting politely for 15 minutes while the two guys working helped other people. I was looking at coins and deciding what I wanted to buy while I waited. The guy working scoffed at me telling me "please stop looking at the coins I've been watching you look at them". I guess I was looking too close to him while he was helping another customer or something?!?!?  Either that or he didn't think I would buy anything so he wanted me gone.  I was dressed very well I came strait from work at Northrop Grumman, I was even wearing a wounded warrior polo so I don't know what his problem was. Maybe he hates wounded vets. Either way I left as fast as I could. Why would I spend thousands of dollars in a place like that?  I will never go back and I hope who ever reads this won't either!!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I give it one star for cleanness.  I was there to look for a gift for my husband's birthday.  I was ignored.  Mine you I had $, if I couldn't afford such a coin I wouldn't set foot in that store. I traveled 3 hour's for my husband!!!  I will never ever go back there again.  Not even for my husband.

I even spent money i hadn't planned.<//review><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80dbff9a5317b2b1:0x50d691289b4a92fe<//gmap_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< user_id>

Strong selection of world and American coins in a variety of metals that work with a wide variety of budgets.  It can be a little hard to get service when it's busy however.< /review>

<Review>One of the best bullion shops I have dealt with ever.  We came in from out of town and wanted to cash out a half oz gold maple.  Thomas offered me spot and paid cash on the spot.  What impressed me is how knowledgeable and friendly the staff was.  Thomas showed me a few devices that can be used to test gold, showed me coins that were thousands of years old, allowed my 10 year old daughter to handle the larger silver items and answered several questions.   Before we left we made sure to stop by and pick up a few items.  For around $75 we bought an oz silver libertad, oz silver kangaroo and an airtight for it and an ancient greece thrace that was dated 400-350 B.C.! The woman working there was very kind and even gave my daughter a box to hold 25 single oz of silver in airtights. Chad was very helpful when I had questions in regards to the ancient coins.  I would recommend this shop to everyone looking for a knowledgeable staff that cares about the hobby of collecting.  Top notch shop with a wide selection of coins,  especially ancient coins.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<UserId.>105713796158065664639</UserId.><Review>3.5 stars. I have tasted the best peruvian in La county in the Cities of El Monte and Gardena.
So when moved to City of LA had high expectations of finding the best Peruvian. Been disappointed so far. Rika’s is tolerable. I cam taste sugar in the stir fried steak which I don’t care for. It does not have that Peruvian taste of lomo saltado. Chicken fried rice the same, missing that Peruvian taste.<//Review>< time>

Wow! Just pure wow! The food was amazing, hot off the stove, and full of flavor! The real winner was the Peruvian hot sauce! It was the only thing I actually got a picture of because everything smelt so good, I had to eat it right away! We tried the chicharron de pollo, chauffeur fried rice, bistek a la chorrillana and got a whole chicken to go! All was spectacular!<//Text>

Because of its size, it seems like most people come here for pickup.

Food:
*PRO TIP: Douse everything in the Aji verde sauce. That thing will make ANYTHING DELICIOUS*
1) Ceviche Mixto - I haven't had bad peruvian ceviche yet. It's one of those peruvian staples that's a safe solid option wherever you go for Peruvian.
2) Lomo saltado - it wasn't perfect, but delicious. The beef could've been more tender, but the flavor was on point. The fries were pretty substantial and filling.
3) Chicharron - I was expecting crispy skin similar to chips, but it was actually small pieces of juicy, battered, fried chicken. The batter wasn't too heavy either. Excellent! The sauces were excellent too.

Service: Pretty slow. One of my friends got his order of lomo saltado and the three of us got ours like 20-30 minutes later, but they did apologize and offer us some soda.

Parking: You can barely call that a parking lot in front. Street parking is a challenge. Seems like people take one of those scooters or use one of the delivery services to get the food from here because the parking situation is less than ideal.

Note to self: Wanted to try the pollo a la brasa but they were out, so I will be back to try it<//review>< username>

<name>Steve Cha</name><date>1603662232658</date><Rating>5</Rating><review>Rikas Peruvian restaurant is like the 5th or 6th Peruvian restaurant I've been to in LA. It's interesting because it's located in Koreatown. But this little Peruvian restaurant packs a bunch. I enjoyed it a lot. It's like classic Peruvian comfort food. If you guys haven't tried their ceviche mixto, it is a must try. It's probably the best Peruvian ceviche I'd had in LA. Nice fresh raw fish, and the sourness to the juice was just about right. Their chaufa pollo, or chicken fried rice, was also another knockout. It's safe to say that this is the best fried rice I've had outside of any Asian restaurant. Haha. Their lomo saltado was also pretty solid. Great sauce, fries, and steak.

In all, I would highly recommend Rikas if you are in town. It is one of the best Peruvian restaurants in the area. You'll feel so great after eating the food here. The chef Jose is also a hospitable man. Look out for him if you come here. I shot a Youtube video of my experience at Rikas, which you can find on my Youtube channel Rockstar Eater.</review>< Pics>

<text>I’m very disappointed in this place, I went in today to pick up so food and I honestly didn’t have the greatest experience, First of all the person who picks up the phone is extremely rude has no customer service skills, second when you arrive the cook is in a bad mood throwing things around not caring about the food I mean it has been the most unprofessional thing I have ever seen. The food is ok but the service is horrible I don’t understand how these people are in business. Think twice before going.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2c77a863cd563:0x60aa78f12d250ab3<//GmapID></record>

Worst owner to deal with. I walked in to ask for the bathroom before I ordered something to eat and all he said was and I quote "the bathroom is for customers only" and walked away before I could say anything. I asked an employee again if I could go but she couldn't do or say anything because the owner was watching. Why should I bother to spend my time and money on a business that gives horrible service and treats potential customers like garbage.</Review>

I came to the Peruvian embassy from Arizona, definitely wanted to taste a little bit of Peru!  This restaurant is absolutely incredible.  La chicha es deliciosa!  El ceviche como debe ser!  The calamari was outstanding and the ribs were phenomenal.  Yo soy bien peruana y mis hijos son bien americanos y le encantaron la comida!  Shout out to the chef he’s absolutely amazing quality all the way from Peru!  Gracias chef José!<//Review>

If you’ve had Peruvian food from Don Felix or Mario’s in Los Angeles then I think you’ll also enjoy Rika’s. The restaurant is much smaller and what I would call “no-frills,”  but Rika’s serves up delicious Peruvian favorites like lomo saltado and ceviche. I found the Chicken saltado to be well seasoned and the ceviche very fresh.< /text>

I visited this place on Sunday evening, I was greeted by friendly staff and  they asked if we would be dining in or out we were dining in so they told us we could sit wherever we want and our waitress came over and took our order, she was friendly and knowledgeable. The food was fantastic, classic peruvian dishes, and good quality ingredients. I have tried a ton of peruvian restaurants in LA being peruvian myself from little hole in the walls to fancy haute cuisine and I have to say this is one of my new favorites. Low key laid back feel with perfectly executed classic peruvian dishes. Better then Marios! (Sorry marios...)<//review>

Rikkas restaurant has to be one of the best places thus far serving up some of the greatest authentic Peruvian dishes there is, starting with their flavorful Lomo saltado and tallarin saltado I've tasted amongst other sought after platters. I've experienced great service, friendly staff,timely served and conveniently located in Koreatown.i will definitely be endorsing this dinning experience.</text>

Best Peruvian in Los Angeles<//review>

<Response>None</Response>< Review>
I ordered the quarter chicken combo and rib appetizer.
The chicken is great and I absolutely love it with the aji verde they serve. And the Peruvian beans, yum!!
The ribs were okay. Very dry.
They also seemed to increase prices recently, I’m guessing to catch up with the loss from the pandemic.
Which is fine, but $14 for dry pork ribs is not it.
The used to be $4 less.
At that rate I’d rather buy a rack from the store for the same price.< /Review>

Been working here for over a year as an OTR driver. Let's be honest you have your good days and you have your bad days. Overall I have loved working here. I enjoyed building relationships with coworkers here and enjoyed the equipment and service this company provides. The pay is competitive for OTR when you look at the big picture. Bottom line is they are up front and honest so you know what you sign up for. Absolutely no complaints from me. Carry on.</Text>

<review>Critical- 2/12 driving southbound on the 99 out of Sacramento heading towards Stockton their company driver almost caused what could have been a 5 car pile up. I also observed the driver:
1. Road rage
2. Tailgating
3. Abrupt lane changes
4. Cutting off others
5. No signal
Posting here today for public record. Also, will be following through with gov/state agencies.
No interest in contacting company,  they seem to have a recurring theme with their responses....either you're a fake post or have the wrong company. I'm neither of those. Be cautious and safe when you observed these trucks on the roads.< /review>< pics>

<Text>I have had multiple incidents of unprofessional and unsafe drivers with this company including today.

One thing they’re famous for is road rage. Even if you did ABSOLUTELY nothing towards them. Very unsafe too. Abrupt lane changing, drifting out of lanes, cutting off others, no signals, etc.

When I called in they didn’t seem too concerned. If you see one of their trucks on the road be careful and expect issues. Their drivers don’t know what the hell they’re doing.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1609005078818, 'text': 'Scottie.  Dont know who you r  sir.  Seems like fake post .

<Text>Not trusted and not recommended

It's funny to see the safety department try and block these reviews that tell the truth And ask every review for their name, not solve the issues.

They once ran the company without insurance. Because the company is cheep.

The safety department loves authority over drivers so much so they just a nag and fire people.

Yes they did run without insurance and there a paper inside all the registration document folder that talks about how they do you have insurance now and that they ran out without insurance and got caught by the federal government.< /Text>< Pics>

I requested that they send someone to estimate what it would cost. They assured me they can determine that by the furniture I check off on their list. I give them a deposit, they came to put the furniture on the truck. After several pieces the head guy says I can't put anymore on bc you've reached 5000 Lbs. Had to pay an extra $500 for him to take a few more pieces and they didn't even take 1/2 of what I needed transported.
I gave them a delivery date based on what the builder told me, when the date changed I called B&B to let them know the date was changed from April 15 and would let them know as soon as I knew the new date.  B&B called in 4/15 to ask me where I wanted them to drop the stuff off. Extremely rude rep from B& B hung up when I explained I had notified his office the date had changed. They dropped my furniture off not at my new house and now I have to pay to have every thing to move everything again. There were items that I have taken pictures of that were broken and will have to send to the insurance company.

Anyone looking to hire B&B Transportation for a move DON'T!!!!   YOU WILL REGRET IT< /Text>

I wish I could rate this company negatively because I would. Before making a move across the country, I first worked with Alan Douglas (moving coordinator) because he would not stop sending follow up emails, so I figured they were reliable. I REGRET NOT LOOKING UP ANY OF B&B TRANSPORTATION'S REVIEWS BEFORE BOOKING THEM.

Alan told me that it would take 7-10 business days for my boxes to arrive. After I agreed to work with B&B, I stopped hearing from Alan. I left voicemails and send emails to Alan, but he never returned any calls or emails. I still have not heard from him.

I'm FURIOUS with how the company's employees were trained. The customer service representatives LIED TO ME EVERYDAY when I had called them (3 straight weeks, Monday - Friday); they told me that my boxes were being picked up from the warehouse "tomorrow" more than a dozen times. IF THEY WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THE TRUTH FROM THE BEGINNING, I would not have been so upset.

Finally, after 27 business days... my boxes get delivered to my house (all smushed up and bent out of shape). I have CLEARLY LABLED my boxes "fragile!" with a sharpie on bright pink scotch tape used to tape the box shut (not to mention I wrote all over the box, "fragile!" "very fragile!". The first box I open has broken glass and a broken durable vase. I am not going to try to fight this company and get my money back - I just want everyone to know my experience with this company, so they can avoid broken items and an outrageously delayed ETA.

IF this is how my things were going to be treated and was going to take this long, B&B needs to tell their customers AHEAD OF TIME, so I can clearly choose another company. THIS COMPANY DOES NOTHING BUT LIE AND DECEIVE THEIR CUSTOMERS.</text>

I regret moving my stuff with B&B Transport,  they are not kind people to deal with. They called you day & night to get your business and throw you off the bus. They will lie to you of one month free storage, they don't do certified weighing, all they will tell after making deposit and pick up date is that they have a weighing sensor to know your stuff even though they already have some other people stuff in the truck, and they end up giving you an outrageous weight figures and price. Watch out for those paper work they will asked you to sign and be wise to make copy cos they do funny. Their dispatch department are the most rudest people in mankind,  they tell you to go to hell and paid the delivery driver and so you know they will start threatened you of auctioning your belonging if you don't pay or meet the date they scheduled your delivery and so you know they will call you for early pick up and delivery base on their own time and wouldn't care about your situation, also make you sign 28 days delay delivery  if needed. They will also blacklist your number after their atrocities,  but I figure out and went ahead to call them with different number and they picked up. PLS SAVE YOURSELF  FROM THESE WORST SITUATION, TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.< /Review>

<Review>I'm new to the company , but in a very short period of time , I can say this is one of the best companies I've ever driven for . Usually I can tell right away what kind of company ,  management , dispatch , etc. ,  I'm dealing with . Believe me , I have no problem handing keys back and quitting the company if I'm not happy . This company hired me on knowing I had special circumstances that would need to be met in order for me or be able to drive for them . They gave me there word it would not be a problem . Of course I was still leary once I started driving because of past promises from other companies that were given just to get me on the road but never held there end of the bargain . That's just not the case here at B&B . They have been great ! In every department ! Easy to communicate with , never left hangin with any issue , always able to contact someone 24/7 ect. . Thus far , I'm happy to say , I'm glad I've signed on with them . I'm willing to bet that the negative reviews are because they've (ones writing the negative review) done something wrong and are mad at themselves for ruining a good gig and don't know how to take responsibility for there own mistakes or they have nothing better to do with there day but to talk bad about something so they can feel better about there own , low self esteemed , selves . Lol , just sayin. Thanks for everything so far B&B . You've been awesome!<//Review>< Pics>

Nice place to stop by, although there can be some homeless people encounters. But overall very nice people running these businesses.</text>

Not the ideal place to shop, there are lots of homeless people and drug addicts along with criminal activity that takes place. Also parking is a nightmare the way people drive causes accidents almost multiple times daily</text>

The pizza hut there is horrible. Cold food after waiting hours. The management does not have any experience. If I could give a -5 I would. Also the fact that they behave as if they are doing something for you is a even worse issue. Customer service??? Please.< /review>

Stopped here on the way to Pinnacles. Couldn't have made a better choice - it's like eating at Grandma's. The food is fresh,  very much home made, with love at that! Great little shop with lovely staff. Go if you can!<//review>

Cute small town cafe with friendly service. The food is simple standard factory ordered food, not farm fresh, but good quick home cooking with lots of bacon grease. It is cozy and quaint with beautiful artwork. It was also clean and welcoming.</Text>

This gem is located in Tres Pinos, just past Hollister on Hwy 25. Delicious home style cooking and they really make you feel at home.</review>

Downhome family-friendly-country atmosphere, excellent fresh food served piping hot, great menu selections. Servings could use a little more spice, servers a little neater attire.<//Review>

Front the moment I stepped in I was greeted by a voice welcoming me in and instructing me to sit. Seconds later I had a well-written menu in my hands and my coffee was on its way. I ordered the pancakes w with eggs and sausage. Eva made me a delicious breakfast. I highly recommend this little cafe/ restaurant to anyone!!!!    Clean great service and delicious food!!!  Included pics from my cell...<//Text>

<user>104369196520540964806</user><Pics>None< /Pics><review>Awsome restraunt hot food delivered to my door. If you call they might deliver to you with a minimum $ORDER. If you order big go through them directly call the restraunt so they keep all the money they make. If small order and its not enough for them to deliver go to Doordash for delivery and order doordash gets a portion of the money so only Doordash if the restaurant cant deliver. Help keep places like this open. We will survive this corona but small restraunts might not if we dont help them.< /review>< rate>

<review>I was very disappointed with the service and my main dish at this restaurant.  Wgat I did like was the tofu I ordered and the pineapple mango tea.  What I did not like was that I ordered pan fried noodles with vegetables (they don't have a good vegetarian option) and the noodles very soft on the bottom of the plate and hard on top.  So I guess the noodles were chow mean (soft) on the top, and hard pretty much the top half of the plate.  It dud not really taste very good.  The service was lacking.  The server did not check on me once during my meal.  I won't go back especially because they don't have much vegetarian dishes to offer (they should offer tofu as you can have with your main dish).</review>< pictures>

<rating>2</rating><text>I was a fan, having gotten takeout here before as well as trying their teas. They are on the five stars app. I came to redeem a free tea, which the app did not mention had any stipulations. I placed the order, and the lady seemed surprised  that I was not ordering anything else. I’m totally fine with percent off coupons for a free item with another purchase, but the coupon had no other stipulations and she simply made up those rules. I ended up walking out of the restaurant.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

As of September, 2020, the restaurant offers 10% off for online orders with a coupon code (sale10) at gochanoicorner.com and if you order either online (on their website) or on the phone for any order over $15, you will get 1 free Red Tea Hibiscus drink. Free shipping for PostMates orders with a coupon code (I7TNGT).

I Find This The Best Northern Vietnamese Style Cuisine Restaurant in Southern California. Here Are The Main Dishes You Should Try At the Restaurant When Coming to Little Saigon because These Dishes Are Unique and Not Ubiquitous:

- Bún Riêu Cua Lột aka crab, eggs, tomato, fried tofu inside a vermicelli noodles soup bowl.

- Bún Chả Hà Nội aka fried ground pork roll with vermicelli noodles and assorted veggies. This is not a noodles soup, and you eat it like eating fried chicken and nuggets with vermicelli noodles and fish sauce mixed together.

- Bún Đậu Mắm Tôm aka rectangular vermicelli noodles assorted with fried tofu, pork, and chả cốm (green rice fried pork nuggets). This is not a noodles soup, and you eat it with shrimp sauce (mắm tôm).

- Bún Cá Rau Thì Là aka Vermicelli noodles soup with fish filet, dill, and water celery

- Bún Mộc and Bún Thang (Different Versions of Vermicelli Noodles Soup with Different Methods of Cooking Pork).

- Lẩu Hải Sản hoặc Lẩu Thập Cẩm aka Seafood or Combo Hot Pot

- Bún Thái Tom Yum aka Tom Yum Noodles Soup. This is not Vietnamese. We borow the noodles soup from the Thai/Dai ethnic in Yunnan and Sichuan province, present day China.

- Chem Chép Nướng Mỡ Hành, Ốc Hương Nướng Bơ Tỏi, và Nghêu Hấp Thái Xả Quế aka Grilled Mussels, Grilled Escargot, and Steamed Clams Soup, respectively.

Bonus: My Favorite Drinks That I Can’t Find Anywhere Else Are Corn Milk (Sữa Bắp) and Lemon Hibiscus Red Tea (Nước Trà Chanh Dây Nhuỵ Hoa Dâm Bụt).< /text>

<text>the Menu of this place is the best for Northern Vietnamese dishes, however, I just regret that the broth soup is very bad, just like water, this ruined everything which the restaurant trying to do!

Bun dau mam tom and bun rieu cua lot probably their best dishes. The mam tom sauce is so good but extra order is $0.50c per sauce. The restaurant brings the Ha Noi vibe to you with their signature Ha Noi food and decoration. Overall everything is good. I also tried the homemade corn milk... so yummy!!< /Text>

I was offered a free Seasalt Cream Jasmine Tea in exchange for this review, and call me a sell-out, but I'll play along happily! In seriousness, the food here is so fresh and vibrant-looking, and it as inexpensive as any Vietnamese food place has any right to be. Decor and atmosphere are quirky and contemporary, and the place feels quite clean and modern. Nice to try a Vietnamese Restaurant with a northern twist. Popular and recommended to give it a try!<//Review>

Great place to eat the authentic Bun Cha Ca Hanoi or any popular dishes from Hanoi Vietnam.This was the second time we came back to this restaurant. Their foods and services were very good, friendly and fast. We ordered Bun ca thang long, baby clams with rice paper, shrimps goi cuon and bun ca Hanoi. their foods indeed were authentic with smells of dills. I was not a fan of dills before after I ate it at this restaurant last time. I am now in love with it. Overall, I really liked the foods here maybe will try out different dishes next time we come. This place was very cleaned and the Restrooms were also remodeled...< /text>

<Text>One of my favorite resto to enjoy Hanoi food. I ordered Soft-shell carb noodle ( Bun rieu) + Baby clam with crispy rice cracker. However, I really think they need to improve their customer service. If you share and like their promotion post on FB, you get a FREE brulee cake cream milk tea. I shared and ordered the drink but they forgot. When I almost finished the food, I reminded the waitress again and waited. However, after I finished my food and waited for 5 minutes, I didn’t see my drink so I came to cashier to pay and asked the third time. He immediately made my drink in less than 3 minutes.</Text>< user_name>

Very good food at cheaper price than most places. The service can be better but not expecting much anyway, recommended for casual dining. The bun cha was quite good. Crispy egg noodle was great, but eggroll needs some work.< /Review>

Authentic food from northern Vietnam.  I had bun dau mam tom (which include a special shrimp paste sauce,  a salty, fragrant sauce with deep fried tofu, boiled pork belly, deep fried meat cake, noodle and fresh vietnamese herbs.) Be careful with the sauce,  it needs a bit of lemon or lime to balance it out.
Wet also ordered bun Cha Ha noi. Similar components,  except the meat is prepared with coconut juice and fish sauce.<//Text>

As for the bun dau mam- the sauce was too salty and the bun was in cubes so it did not taste that great overall. It was a new experience here since this was the first time i tried it here.< /Text>< user>

<Text>Mediocre northern style Vietnamese food,  their dishes taste normal to me,  nothing's special. Even the most praised dish "bun dau mam tom" wasn't all that. Never,  its probe is very affordable. Service is above average compare to other Vietnamese restaurants.</Text>< UserId.>

My new favorite place for bún riêu! Grilled sea snails with butter and garlic were tender and flavorful $8.50 although shells are feeling apart but didn't affect flavor. Bún chả was pretty good $9 but I recommend asking for another small bowl to eat from combined with noodles and veggies as the pork broth is served in can be quite salty but savory. Bún riêu $9.50 is by far the best I've ever eaten at a restaurant! Interior is very cute and tastefully decorated. Parking can be a bit challenging if you eat during peak lunch and dinner times. They also deliver using Postmates and use Five Star point rewards system. There's also another new location just opened Nov 2019 at Bolsa and Magnolia.</text>

We came here on a Saturday night, there was no wait for a table (for four) even though it was busy.  The service was great, the ringers on the tables let them know when you are ready to order and they are there within minutes of pressing it.  We tried several dishes, the soups are fantastic and the garlic escargot are delicious!!< /review>

Authentic Ha Noi cuisine in the middle of Orange County. The restaurant design brings you to the street corner of Ha Noi, a very unique feature. Soft music playing on the background. I would highly recommend you to try this lovely restaurant!</Text>

Really great place to get northern Vietnamese food, especially bun mam tom. There isn't too many places that offer this dish, but this place is number #1. Also this place is a low key boba shop/restaurant as well. It boba is high quality same as other boba joint. Definitely recommend this place.</Text>

<Text>We were surprised at how average the dishes are.  We’re even puzzling at how it got such a great reviews, too.  We ordered the basic northern dishes, grilled pork (bún chả Thăng Long), fried shrimp and sweet potatoes, fried tofu and fish paste dill vermicelli soup, all were very average.< /Text><Name>Nicole Tran<//Name>< rating>

<Text>The food was fantastic, as you can see in the pictures. We got the bun rieu (tomato crab noodle soup), banh cuon (rice paper), popcorn chicken, and corn milk. All were delicious and the biggest surprise was corn milk for me -- who knew corn in liquid dessert form tasted so good?

The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant is warm and modern. The painting in the main dining area is fantastic (you'll know it when you see it).

A great and affordable spot.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Doesn't not taste like Ha Noi foods. I was expecting a lot, but it didn't meet my expectations. "Chả cá Thăng Long" didn't have enough "thì là". "Bún đậu mắm tôm", the tofu was too dry, the noodles was also dry, fish sauce was not salty enough.<//Review>

This place doesn’t have your traditional beef noodle Pho. When I arrived at the restaurant I was a bit disappointed to find out they didn’t have Pho. Either way I order the Bum Thai Tom Yum and it was pretty good. However, for me, this was a place I tried once and never again. Great Soup but no Pho.< /review>

Yes, yes and yes again. Some of the best North Vietnamese cooking I've had in a long time. We were visiting Anaheim, and this place came highly recommended, so a $24 Uber ride later, it was so worth it. The food comes quick, piping hot and delicious. Next time I find myself anywhere in SoCal, I'll come back!</text>

<review>This in an interesting restaurant. The smell upon entering is not something you can call pleasant.  It smelled like old fish sauce and a bit of old rag mixed with heavy fish broth. The food came out and it was pretty good, good enough to eat but not good enough to make me want to come back anytime soon. Most of the food came out within 5 minutes of ordering.  It makes you wonder how they get it ready so fast?! We ordered some escargot.  It was heavily garlic-spiced flavored.    If the garlic was cooked out a bit, it would have been better.< /review>< Pics>

<review>The food was all delicious (we had bun cha and bun thit nuong cha gio) and the drinks were excellent (passion fruit ice tea with basil seeds and ice coffee).  The server was really friendly. One note: when you're done, you pay at the front. They don't bring the bill to you.< /review><gmap_id>0x80dd28901cdc306f:0xa39be0546952ebf4< /gmap_id><Name>Lisa Anderson</Name><UserId.>112091018855043002530<//UserId.><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG42nq8fWRryktUga1_JqJNsf6pztsXEODpP0B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-JL-TPD9rMJFu7Ea5QbJ2wtRA66s0JEH-te8V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

If you are craving for a good bowl of bún riêu then you are in for a treat at Ha Noi Corner. Their Bún riêu cua lột Hà Nội (soft-shell crab, tomato and tofu vermicelli soup - Ha Noi style) is as good as it gets. The eye-catching broth, the wonderful aroma along with the different textures of the ingredients make their bún riêu cua lột absolutely fantastic. I have been there so many times and only a few times in which I was able to order something else.
Don't get me wrong, they have many delicious dishes here but Bún riêu cua lột Hà Nội is my go to dish!<//text>

I love this place! Portion is very big you can probably share between 2 people if you don't eat a lot. They don't have a lot of selections but every single item on the menu is spot on! Prices are also on the low side - less than $10 per item.

Parking can be a little tricky if you come for dinner since they don't have a lot of parking and you will probably have to park in the residential area right next to it. They also have a rewards program if you come a lot and pay by cash!< /Review>

Food and service are OK from scale 1-10.  I give a 6 at best.  Bills have to pay at cashier and service is just average nothing worth to comment.<//Text>

Had Bun thang here and Garlic Butter Mussels and Bun Cha Ha Noi! Everything was delicious and authentic! I love how prices are VERY AFFODRABLE (most items under $10) and everything is VERY SHAREABLE with another person or more.

Love the variety of AUTHENTIC NORTHERN VIET DISHES!<//review>

It was my first time eating here and my server was very patient and kind while helping me decide what to order. Not only that, but service is very fast and everyone is very attentive! It is a very wholesome and clean place, a great place for families. The prices are great and the food was amazing. I’m not from this area but I would definitely make the drive again!</review>

Highly recommended if you're looking for a casual restaurant. Plenty of tables and parking lots. Menu is simple. Food came out pretty on time whenever I was here for lunch. Service and space were normal compare to the price of a one $ place. The reason I keep coming back is their Seasalt Cream Tea, tasty and refreshing! Never forget to order that!</text>< pictures>

I ordered the Thai seafood noodle soup and it was delicious! The place is clean and nicely decorated and the staff are friendly & attentive. They also offer Northern Vietnamese dishes that are hard to find at other Vietnamese restaurants in the area (because a majority specialize in Southern Vietnamese cuisine).<//review>

i was introduced to a northern cuisine for the first time by my friend and i have to say i was very satisfied and would definitely return again when i visit OC!! We ordered the baby clams with crispy rice crackers, the escargot with garlic butter, and the grilled mussles with onion sauce. We were very impressed with the mouth watery taste< /review>

I've been here twice this week and the service is fast and accomodating. I was properly greeted at the door and seating was quick. I ordered about 4 entrees and everything came out within 5 minutes.. Probably the quickest service ever at an Asian restaurant. I would recommend this restaurant!!</review>

Very different food from what I am used to eating, but I am so glad that I got to try it out. I had the spring rolls in both shrimp and spam. I enjoyed my meal and the rice. The prices are reasonable too! Good service overall.<//Text>

My go-to place for bun rieu!! Must add the mam and fresh chili and it’s perfect. PLUS you get a soft shell crab with it. 😋 I’ve also tried their escargot with garlic butter and pepper and it was good as well. I come here at least once a week!!< /text>

Love the ambience and the aroma of the food. Some of it is pretty flavorful. Had a bit too much dill in my fish noodle soup. The seasalt cream jasmine tea hits the spot too!
Parking is a bit limited but there's street parking too<//text>

Great spot to go to for authentic vietnamese food. Although I don’t love all their dishes and they can be inconsistent, there are some that are better quality than a lot of other places! Their drinks are also great especially the sea cream drinks :)< /review>

One of my favorite places to eat bun cha Ha Noi. They make it with your choice or regular vermicelli noodles or flat rice sheets. I had tried both and although both are good but the flat rice sheets are my favorite.

Their service is fast and everyone is so nice. They speak both English and Vietnamese. Servers are patient and will make suggestions if you are unsure what you want.

I came here for Mother's day and received a free Macaron Ice Cream sandwich. They were delicious! I would definitely recommend this place! A must try if you are in town.<//Text>

That won't be too hard because they have a large selection of flavored and milk teas to choose from. The honey boba is soft and chewy. It's on the sweet side though, but I liked it. I've been here twice in the past week, and the service is was quick and friendly both times. Depending when you go, parking can be tricky and you may have to park further down the street by the houses if the parking lot is full. The entree selection is smaller compared to other restaurants, but that just means your choices are probably all good.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Everything we got was very good, the sauces that accompanied the Spring rolls and the wrap it yourself meat platter was so good. A very nice balance of sweet and salty.

Parking is a pain, very limited. Service was almost nonexistent, but expected. We had to try so hard to flag down a person, but it's not a big deal.

Restaurant is clean and big, we got sat down pretty quick. Only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the banh duc, a tad too soft, and salty.</text>

It's not that I'm cheap, but the service is not all that 5 🌟 type. It's not fair for restaurants to forced us the customers to paid for the waiters/waitress salary, especially when no one really check you how you are doing and you have to yell for service. Tips is for good service NOT forced.</review>< pics>

Modern , clean and spacious. Food is great but my wife, who is from Northern Vietnam, said it is not 100% authentic Ha Noi dishes. Still it is a breath of fresh air since Ha Noi  Corner offers a lot of tasty and unique dishes that I haven't see at any other restaurants in OC.
6/9/2018: still good, but not as good as before.< /text>

<review>I love coming here to get my authentic Vietnamese food. They specialize in northern Vietnamese food which is a nice switch from your typical pho restaurant. In addition, they have boba as well! I highly recommend coming here if you’re in the area.</review>< userid>

Service was good, food was nice but not excellent.  The famous Bun Rieu actually tasted the same or almost the same as my mom's, which is nice but is not the best that I've tasted. Lau Thai was ok, ingredients tasted fresh.</review>

Some interesting northern dishes. I have been twice and I think the quality is inconsistent. I think it's worth it to try dishes you can't get elsewhere but typical dishes like the bún chả Hà Nội were disappointing.</review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Their specialty dishes are delicious. Quite unique too as it's not your stereotypical Viet restaurant with just pho and spring rolls. Great variety and lesser known dishes.

Again try B1 on the menu. Really delicious flavor I haven't seen elsewhere. Drinks are ok but a bit too sugary in my opinion. I would recommend asking for half sugar.

For the price and taste this place is a solid 5/5.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Great Bun dau mam tom! I love their Cha com fried cake, very crunchy and tasty. However, the waiter didn't pay much attention to our order. We asked for water with no ice and still got two cups full of ice (it was not very crowded) 😐. Overall, it's a good place to try Vietnamese food.<//Review>< pics>

Food is cheap and it is really good quality. However, The table is small and uncomfortable for our group. Because we have a group of 8 people. Overall everything is good except the uncomfortable table.< /Text>

<review>The restaurant is nicely decorated. The food presentation is attractive. The service is friendly. The chilli sauce is fresh and super spicy. The herbs are fresh and clean. The bun cha came out warm and I was envious of my girlfriend's sizzling hot plate of cha ca. The flavor was good. I'll probably go back to try something else from the menu.<//review>< Pictures>

<time>1529541587430</time><Rate>2< /Rate><review>You know they give out free milk tea if you write a review right? That means you can't really trust the review system anymore! Well, I got fooled by all the advertisement. Advice to people who want to try good Vietnamese food: this is not the place!!!

Rear parking is limited, side parking is scary and weird.
Inside decor is nice.

Service is bad! They forgot about half of our order, then the waitress came out and ask us "oh the food is not out yet?" Uhmmm I don't work here girl, idk?!!!

Food:
Bun cha Hanoi is supposed to be the signature dish of any Hanoi restaurant here in OC, but they made it poorly: the meat cake was dry, the fish sauce was really salty... If you know Vietnamese cuisine you know that the sauce is the most important part of many many dishes. They failed with this signature one.
Bun dau mam tom was a 3.5/5, I have to give it to them on the mam tom though, they made a good job with the sauce on this dish. Just the cha com was terrible, it's like eating a very moist sticky rice cake being fried...
Bun ca was a disappointment! The soup isn't sour enough. It seems to me like they don't put in the effort of making the different broth for different noodle soup. Bun ca has its own kind of broth, pho has its own kind of broth, bun rieu has its own kind of broth....

In conclusion, I don't like it!!! You might get better dishes than we did maybe.... At your own risk you come in!< /review>< Pics>

<review>This place had mold in their sriracha bottles. Unfortunately, I realized it after I had some. I reported it to the staff and manager but they didnt seem to care. They didnt even apologize for this. Their food wasnt anything to rave about. I wouldnt come back.</review>< rating>

< Resp>
{'time': 1527721709228, 'text': "Annie, We tried to explain to you that it was not mold but you didn't want to understand. It was the ingredients layering under cold AC. The bottle itself was opened a day before and still had the expiration date until 2020. I bet you didn't even read the expire date when bringing it to us. We didn't apologize because it was not even a fault. We just simply answered your question and gave you the explanation you wanted. We did nothing wrong to receive your 1 star but here you go. Again, it was not mold, and yes we did care about the customer opinions and tried to explain to you but you chose not to listen. We are a busy restaurant and only use fresh ingredients to cook, and we don't stock too much to maintain its freshness. If it was mold and if anything wrong happened after you consumed it, feel free to come back and we will show you the receipt of the supermarket we bought it from just a couple of days before so you can complain directly to them, or you can even complain to Huy Fong company since the bottle has the expiring date until 2020. But from our experience and a lot of other consumers' experience, it Was Not Mold, just the layering of ingredients. I'll leave it here for you to Google some more before you bring the same complaint to other restaurants serving sriracha."}</Resp>

My first impressions of the overall appearance and aroma of the restaurant were, “Suits the name perfectly.” The restaurant is located quite literally on a corner and the inside aesthetically pleases your eyes with the brick walls and dining booths. I visisited this place with my family and we ordered a variety of dishes from Cuon (Spring Rolls) to Escargot to the classic Bún cha Ha Noi (Grilled Pork vermicellli, fresh herbs, and fish sauce). They were relatively tastey and easy to consume. What I would recommend from the Ha Noi Corner specifically is their B1. Bun cha Ha Noi. I swear this is only second to pho when it comes to authentic Vietnamese food and it is amazing! The servers were also quite responsive and friendly. Overall a very nice restaurant for Vietnamese food!<//review>

<Text>Just discovered this place in Garden Grove.
Got bún chả hà nội, bún riêu, bún đậu mắm tôm, và nghêu hấp thái.
All of them taste delicious.
The service is also nice.
A bit hard to find parking but I will come back for good food.<//Text>< Pics>

We’ve been here twice in one week! I love viet food because it’s so fresh perfect for this warmer weather and their drinks are on point. The husband liked the bun Thit Nuong and I liked the bun Cha Ha Noi. The salted Carmel milk tea was so yummy! I’ve also tried their lychee drink and that was also super refreshing.< /text>

< review>
Writing my review for the free sea salt cream jasmine tea. Otherwise, my opinion is purely my own.

I had the 67. bun rieu and it was delicious! I think it is the best I have had in O.C. I also tried the clam porridge and it was very interesting. The iced coffee macchiato with hokkaido cream was also a treat. I liked all of my ordered dishes and drinks! Would recommend and would come back!

I'm taking 1 star off because there was a piece of plastic wrap in my Gf's porridge lol.</review>

The food here is great!  I especially like the bún chả Hà Nội.  This is also a great place to come for milk teas.  Parking may be a little tough, but I’ve never had a problem since I avoid the busy times.  The only thing missing from this restaurant is alcohol.< /Review>

Entree was the crab bun rieu. 4/5. Broth was perfect combination of sweet, salty and savory but the half soft shell crab was underwhelming. Honestly, I'd rather have more crab mix, or Cha lua. I think it's all presentation. The crab mix was mixed in a ball too well too. I like my bun rieu crab mix scattered.

I'll want to try another joint before coming back for this bun rieu.</text>< pics>

<Time>1526069562779< /Time><rate>5<//rate><review>I really enjoy dining here at any time of the day.
It is absolutely delicious and the presentation of the food is well represented.

I was craving Bun Cha Ha Noi and found this restaraunt on yelp. I wanted to try a new restaraunt and drove here. The restaraunt is "not in your face" and from the direction I was heading, I had to make a U turn. I did not have trouble finding parking, but this place could get packed.

We were quicklyy seated and the staff were very nice and polite. We sat at the booth and it was spacious. They hire just the right amount of staff that you do not need to chase them down if you needed something. The menu was straightforward and there were photos to go along with the food items. I ordered Bun Cha Ha Noi and my mom ordered a variety platter. The food came out very quickly. The food presentation was adorable with the banana leaf and so. They put a whole bottle of water on your table for your and their convenience. The cups are cute and perfect size.

Bun Cha Ha Noi had the right amount of additives to it, it was very flavorful with vermicelli noodles and the meat were fantastic. They make it just right and perfected the dish that their was no pork smell to it. I really enjoyed it and so did my mom. I have not tried their desserts but can guarantee that their main dishes are worth the drive, at least for me since I am not around the area. I also signed up for their phone list to earn credits to receive freebies, it is a neat concept that I do not see most Vietnamese restaraunt does.

We had such a great meal, my mom asked me to drive her back here again the next time. And again, we had a good time, it was not packed when we arrived in the morning. The service, again, was excellent and the food was yummy. I highly reccommend this restaraunt.</review>< pictures>

Heard about this restaurant from a friend so decided to give it a try.  Found parking in the rear of the restaurant. The place has nice decor. I ordered the Bún Riêu Cua Bể it came with 1 soft shell crab and the broth is good. I like lots of tía tô with my bún riêu but didn’t came with enough mint; hence, reason for only 4 stars. Will definitely come back to try other dishes<//review>

<Name>Sally Nguyen</Name><review>I wish this restaurant was closer to me. I'm a Viet born and raised so I know how authentic this place is. The food was ridiculously good and cheap for the price. I tried sooo many restaurants in the area for the right Bun Cha. This place has it right. I was devouring it. Do yourself a favor and came to this place right now!

Still love this place after coming back again!<//review><Response>None< /Response><Time>1529279841288<//Time>< UserId.>

<text>We found this place on FB and decided to give it a try.  We screened thru the menu and pricing is pretty reasonable.  We ordered Tom yum noodles, bun thit nuong and banh Tom co ngu.  Bun thit nuong was delicious. Banh Tom Co ngu could be better if we ate it right away. Tom yum soup was not bad either.  The free sea salt jasmine tea was the bomb.  The server was extremely courteous, excellent service.  We will definitely come back.</text><username>Julio Romero</username></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Accidentally ran across this shop and was hungry. Try Thang Long Fish Cake. The children brought out very quickly, which meant no need to wait long. Seeing that the noodles and fish bowl are suddenly peeling and the smell is very good already. Eat into the confusion. Prices under $ 10. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with pictures of Hanoi streets. Serve well Ok. The stewardess introduced here delicious rieu vermicelli, which many diners favor. Looking at the menu, any dish I like. Maybe a few days stop to try something else.

Vô Tình chạy ngang qua quán này mà đang đói bụng. Ăn thử món Chả Cá Thăng Long. Mấy nhỏ mang ra rất là nhanh, tức không cần phải đợi lâu. Nhìn thấy măm bún và thố cá đang có lữa kêu lột đột và mùi rất thơm là biết ngon rồi đó. Ăn vào mê muội luôn. Giá cả dưới 10$. Nhà hàng trang trí rất đẹp với tranh ảnh phố Hà Nội. Phục vụ cũng Ok.  Cô tiếp viên giới thiệu ở đây món bún riêu ngon lắm cá nhiều thực khách ưa chuộng.  Nhìn cái menu thì món nào mình cũng thích.  Chắc vài ngày ghé qua thử mấy món khác.<//Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Specializing in selling dishes from Hanoi! The best thing for me is that there is a shrimp-bean noodle soup that is delicious. There are also snail dishes, vermicelli, rice, and noodles made in the Hanoi style. The seats are quite comfortable, the staff here are quite attentive and enthusiastic, everyone can come and try it out!

Chuyên bán các món ăn đến từ Hà nội! Đặc sắc nhất với mình thì có món bún đậu mắm tôm là ngon. Ngoài ra còn có các món ốc hoặc bún, cơm, phở làm theo kiểu Hà Nội. Chỗ ngồi khá thoải mái, các bạn nhân viên viên ở đây phục vụ khá chu đáo và nhiệt tình, mọi người có thể đến thưởng thức thử  xem thế nào!< /text>< Pics>
