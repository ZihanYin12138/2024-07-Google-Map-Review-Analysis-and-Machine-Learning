<Text>LACC is a great community college that has exceeded my expectations!

If you are looking to transfer, then the counselors have your back. They make it easy for you to understand. This is also a great place to simply take classes.
They also have good benefits such as mental health services for their students.

Most professors are chill and the campus is lovely.< /Text><date>1618344671616<//date></record>

Graduated here in 2018, great community college. Yes the school is not perfect. but it is affordable and offers all sorts of programs for students or people who are interested in learning a new skill. Only downside is the homeless/crackheads who easily make their way in the school's restroom and leave all their mess inside. A bit more security is needed also because of the area surrounding the school. Also, the lack of good professors can be difficult but overall it's a good community college!</review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I attended a number of semesters here, first one was Spring 2002 semester. Loved this campus since I was a kid though, in the 1980s, visiting the campus. Beautiful campus, one of the embodiments of the spirit of East Hollywood. The campus has changed significantly over the years, I like both the old and new versions. And both the old and new library. If you're not looking to attend, the campus is also a great place to just chill for a bit, take a walk through here, sit, read. You can even grab some food from the food truck that's usually on campus when classes are in session. Or read some books at the nice LACC library, though you can't check them out unless you're enrolled. They used to have some books for sale there too. Maybe sometimes they still do. Check library hours and whether they are closed until the next semester of classes begins, as they often do that.</Text>< Response>

Very cool. Had a paintball war and formed a faction with my study group here and acted like Han Solo. A different college came in and tried to take over, but my friends beat them faster than you could possibly think.</Review>

< review>
My first impression is based on the communication and interaction I've received from staff as a new student. I understand we are in the middle of a pandemic but the lack of response from the Admissions Office and Counseling Department has led me to believe this institution couldn't care any less if I reach my educational goals with them or not. I have been given the runaround for the last 2 months regarding my status as a new student and what is required of me. Their website states that in order to receive Priority Registration you must complete the requirements listed on your Student Portal by May 29, 2020, well my Student Portal hasn't been updated since I applied. There is no confirmation that my transcripts have been received and I can't even get in touch with anyone to confirm this. On top of this requirement being needed to complete my registration I also am required to speak with a Counselor, in April I was told I could do this via their LIVE CHAT but the Counselor's don't even respond to the chats and 99% of the time they have their status as Offline or Away. If you're lucky to get a hold of a Counselor during the LIVE CHAT they leave you unanswered for 30+ minutes in hopes that you'll just close out the chat and if they do respond they give you short answers and attitude. Because I have college credits I received outside of LACC I actually can't talk to someone via LIVE CHAT. I have to schedule an appointment with a Counselor. I submitted a request for a Counseling Appointment on May 1, 2020 and in the confirmation email I received I was told someone would be in touch with me, two weeks passed and I heard nothing so I was told by a Success Coach in the LIVE CHAT to follow-up with an email to Online Counseling. Today I emailed the Counseling Dept. to check the status of my request and I learn that there are no appointments available at this time and to check back the week of May 26 to schedule an appointment again, yet in order for me to receive Priority Registration I need to have all of this completed by May 29th! I attempted to LIVE CHAT with THREE counselors this afternoon, 2/3 never responded and 1 took 45 minutes to respond only to tell me the LIVE CHAT is for "quick fixes" and to schedule an appointment again with Online Counseling even though I told him I've already done that and the email referred me to speak to someone via LIVE CHAT, his response was to submit another request. I think it's safe to say I won't meet the deadline even though I've been trying to get all of this taken care of since March! It's not fair that I have to penalized for missing the deadline when I've made every attempt and used every resource the college provides to get my new student requirements completed. I was so excited to get back into school so I could finish my degree but this experience has left me feeling so discouraged. Never has a college/university made me feel this way. We are all having to adjust to the way we interact with each other because of this pandemic so I understand the changes but communication should remain the same. Your students shouldn't feel like they are being left in the dark. The last school I attended answered my questions by communicating effectively and handled my request efficiently when I was reaching out to get my transcripts DURING THE PANDEMIC and I'm not even a student there anymore, yet I can't even get an email update from LACC that my transcripts were received. I am very unhappy with my experience and I am considering withdrawing my application all together until this pandemic blows over, I have a feeling that's what they want me to do anyway as it one less person that have to help. Also, update your website. It's so scattered with inconsistent fonts, sizes, colors, and links that appear clickable but aren't which makes it overwhelming and extremely difficult to navigate.< /review>

<review>This school was great when I first attended it back in 2010-2012. I am trying to return to it but it has changed so much. The campus isn't as nice as it use to look and the staff are very rude. For some reason, I could not log onto the computers on campus due to an error on the school's end and the librarian was accusing me of wanting to surf the web for leisure when in actuality, I wanted to add a class before taking a walk down the admins&records. When I got to admins&records, I waited a few hours to get my name changed on their system to my new last name. I brought passport, SSN, birth certificate, marriage certificate, student ID number. I was told that everything was processed and fine. Now I am told that I  need to go back and wait in another four hour line because "there must be a glitch in the system and those documents were not documented" Another error on their end and I'm not given an option that would not require me waiting in such a long line. Tried getting a student ID and I was told after all that waiting that day "Oh, my supervisor needs to be present for that. That person should be back in an hour or so, I think" I wasn't going to wait any longer that day. This place hired bright, college students with a sense of professionalism and now it seems to be different. Getting a response over e-mail hasn't happened, a month later and  . Hopefully the classes are still good. Oh, and every Thursday I am to wait online at a certain time and try booking an appointment with a counselor to discuss transferring. It has been over two months and even if I am on the dot of when the booking page is open, I still haven't been able to secure an appointment. They book out in seconds. I wonder how many more months it will be before this question can be answered.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Time>1560535308681< /Time><GmapID>0x80c2c750ca6eed1d:0x1f85c8d4d78504b<//GmapID><Resp>None< /Resp>< Rating>

<UserId.>103312665937359963966<//UserId.><Review>For professors... do your research on ratemyprofessor and you will be fine, they have never steered me wrong. Thus, I have never had a bad experience with the instructors at this campus. Besides that, I honestly don't know why they bother hiring ANYONE at the student services building when all they do is lead you back to information on the website! It's absolutely ridiculous. The counselors are hard to reach, the business center gives you the run around on almost all matters, and they have the nerve to put the rudest lady at the information desk who literally never has an answer to any question. I agree with other reviews that dealing with the staff in this campus can very much feel like dealing with the DMV. The library is a joke, they allow homeless people to nap inside and the people there to help when asked questions hardly ever have an answer.  So if you can avoid it, I advice you to save yourself the hassle, reserve your positive energy and handle all of your matters online! I will say however that the friendliest staff I have encountered are the janitors, I wish they would hire more of them as the cleanliness in this campus could be improved dramatically.</Review><response>None< /response><date>1582074201170< /date><username>Lucero C<//username></record>

Faculty here is very rude and controlling, they want to do the least amount of work as possible. You will be scoffed at and given dirty looks if you don't know the exact answer for their questions. Not very welcoming and not very helpful, at least for the office people, reminds me of the DMV 🤢< /Review>

Currently trying to register for classes and being stone walled at every turn. If you plan on going to here don't think you'll be able to do a single useful thing over the phone as all their staff in every department only know how to give excuses and tell you to call back later. Completely useless.</review>

Looks like a great campus with a great location. Went to a College to Counselor Summit event that was really cool to expose the school and its services it provides.  The freshmen are well looked after by a unique program they have.  You can get college internship credit for working in your field! They have great career paths.<//text>

Small campus, easy to navigate. Campus maps displayed several places on campus.

Student Service Building is a newer building. You can register the classes, pay the tuition fees and apply financial aid at this building.

There is a food truck at the courtyard, selling beverages and snacks.

The Parking: Parking lot 1 & 2 are across street from the campus. Daily parking fee $2. Parking lot 3 is right next to Student Service Building. The entrance to Parking lot 3 is not on Vermont Ave, side street near Melrose.<//Text>

<Text>Their system is always down. They make it hard for CSU students to take classes here . The financial aid office is awful, be ready to wait from 30-60 minutes unless you go there in the morning. The only good thing is the variety of resources they offer such as welcome center , library and counseling. Also classes are really easy if you know your stuff.<//Text><pics>None</pics><name>Enrique Mejia</name>< userid>

The reason why I gave this a 5 star was because the mlk library! Such a great place to study at! So quiet and spacious, 3 floors and each floor had a separate room with a board, eraser, board markers, desk, and chairs so groups of more than 2 can study.</text>

I TOOK 2 CLASSES AT YOUR CAMPUS
A FEW YEARS AGO. THE PROFESSORS WERE SO STIMULATING. I LEARNED SO MUCH. THE EXPERIENCE WAS A GREAT

WONDERFUL PROFESSORS.

<username>Odas18</username><Review>Financial aid is all jacked up. Admission can't even talked about them cause they lost 4 times my transcripts. 2 in which Santa Monica college send and 2 which I personally dropped off. Management is bad. No wonder a few years ago they were going to get shut down. They need to team up wth Santa Monica college and learn from them. Instead of investing on expanding there campus, fix the current campuses you have. Bring better professor invest in that. whats the point of having a phone in admissions if they never reply? Financial Aid is all jacked up staff doesn't know what their doing. Why hire people who lose paper work and don't know what their doing. If i was in charge of that school i would fire everybody their useless.</Review><user_id>116614672778521392372<//user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Rate>

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Five stars go to their professors and instructors.

⭐️⭐️⭐️ Three stars for their food places and poor healthy food selection.

⭐️ One star goes to an inadequate person working at the student services department and answering phones. I wish I had her name. Giving wrong hours of operation is unacceptable. Even after I asked 2 more times to confirm, because the hours were also listed on the website and I was getting suspicious. Basic training 101 was clearly missed.<//review>

<text>Since I just started coming here to Lacc because I’m taking the summer bridge classes of the FYE program and recently graduated from high school, I already like the school because the teachers/professors I have are nice and help you with your classwork. I really recommend Lacc to those who haven’t decided what career they want to major in. And Lacc has a long history of having many stars or celebrities who attended here and it was UCLA that was previously here.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

It's close to my house and classes are great with the help of awesome teachers.
Taking child development and it's great so far.....
I recommend that everything must be done online yourself, asking for help at LACC isn't guaranteed because there students also. Keeping your things in order, neatly, and on time will help you with classes, financial aid etc...
GOOD LUCK!!!<//Review>

This is a wonderful school, the professors are not hit and miss, its just that you have to ask before you take just any professor, but its not a bad idea to adjust to the varying professing styles that they employ at the school.  This would be the ideal school to attend if you are seeking to transfer considering this is only a 2 year college and would prepare you for transfer the lecture styles of various professors at standard 4 year universities; while gaining entry into the 4 year as a junior and with an AA in the field of study.  The financial aid process has become very bureaucratic considering they ensured the right information was given and the process which to go about correcting if there was problem.< /Text>

Los Angeles City College has a wide range of classes that covers most everything. I’m never disappointed with the classes I enrolled in. The best part is there is a metro subway station entrance at the northeast corner of the campus so ride the metro and get to class in a relaxed state of mind.</Text>

I'm a journalism major and the classes here are a waste of time!  The only reason I attended this school was because it was highly recommended from my past teacher.  So, instead of going straight to Cal State Long Beach I went here.  My first semester on the Collegian newspaper was a horrible experience. I went there to learn how to write better get published articles for an internship at the LA Times.  What a load of crap.  The paper is run by the students, so they pick and choose what students publish and the teacher and department head can't do a thing about it. I made several complaints yet I saw no change. I was really disappointed in the time I wasted here. I really was looking forward to learning how to become a better writer and journalist. Now I'm only enrolling next semester  just for the credits I need transfer, I might as well it's not like they truly care. My suggestion for those who are journalism majors, DO NOT attend here and attend another school like Pierce College. I had a better experience there and the instructors are now involved unlike here at LACC. It's just too far now that I'm working closer to home.  Good luck!</Text>

<Review>I hate this college because they protect a unprofessional microbiology professional named David Sanchez.  Please don't take his class. You would be regret it and he would ruin your life. He sexual harass me during his lecture and have been calling my cell phone and stalking me for a long time. I rejected him then he lower my exam grade on purpose. I only got a B because of I rejected him. He is mental unstable and crazy. He is very unprofessional.
This college won't fire him after I report such a bad evil person.  Please go to another better college.  This college would ruin your life!  It is the worst!</Review>< Pics>

This collage is alright. Nothing special. Sime teachers are great, I really do like them. They are remodeling and expanding which is great, means is improving. Some classrooms are disgusting specially at the science building, smells awful and not all rooms are air conditioned. I do like the math buildings, they are nice and clean. The library is nice to, a lot of book selection, 3 floors and i like the huge glass windows.< /Review>

<text>I never took classes at LACC but by mistake I sent them a transcript request along with a $10 money order to expedite. They took the trouble to track at which community college I had classes, ordered the relevant transcript for me (which I already received) and returned my money order. I want to take this opportunity to thank them for their expedience and thoughtfulness! Wish I knew the names of the people who went the extra mile.</text>< Pictures>

<review>Majored in Cinema & Television.... Good instructors but absolutely NO true internships. Totally bogus.
Also having 0 Sports teams, we did not have any way to gain real field experience using related equipment on location. I STILL get questions from potential employers and contacts who ask "How the hell did your college (In the 2nd largest city in the US) NOT have a sports program???

Nearly EVERY school of higher learning with a television program has a SPORTS team of some kind .....OR......PARTNERS with another school or schools with proper equipment and some type of sport so students can shoot, edit, operate mobile unit and microwave, commentate on camera, ENG, etc... So that way one can leave with a bit more confidence, live remote experience and of course...a REEL.</review>< pics>

Went to trade tech and asked about a program they offered they said unfortunately the only school the program ABA approved was LACC. The counselor still helped me to the best and said she wish she knew more about the program LACC offered. So I drive 30 min to LACC. The people at LACC we’re so rude. Went to the first floor and asked excuse me mam where’s the counselors office she’s Rudly says can you read and points to the sign. Okay I went to the second floor, and I asked the guy can i talk to a counselor he’s like what do you need help with I told him and he tosses me some papers comes outside and says this is what you need I’m like what are the prerequisites for this class. “Um look online.” And Im like okay sir can you please help me he’s like that’s all to it takes these classes and that’s it. Okay okay and looks at me with a blank face. I was so confused as to how this guy became a counselor. Very rude and was in a rush to take lunch/ talking to his co workers. Sadly I have to come back to this school because it’s ABA approved. They treat you mean and talk to you threw. Glass window where everyone can hear your business. I felt as if I was at the DMV or something. They need to retrain these people to at least be nice and helpful.< /text>

The thing about this place that many people don't understand is that it's not a big place, it's not very popular, but it's incredibly accessible, more so than Santa Monica College, at least, which is a good thing for people who can't or won't go all the way out there for whatever reason. Everything is easily walkable and there are a ton of places to eat. Unfortunately, oftentimes you'll find that classes have been overfilled and have a waiting list, but there are usually more than enough classes, depending on the subject. A lot of the teachers here really know what they're talking about, even the adjunct professors. This IS a smoke free campus, so you'll find that most people smoke around the entrances, which can be a bit annoying, but it's just what happens. I say give this place a chance and you'll be pleasantly surprised at how much you learn and how much more comfortable you are being able to literally walk here, instead of taking a 2+ hour bus ride elsewhere.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The classes have been nice, but every other aspect of this school delivers frustrating experiences. The financial aid department seems very under qualified. Their lack of experience and lack of helpfulness resulted in my financial aid being late.

Every attempt I have made to make an appointment with a counselor has been futile. I have tried over the course of months and there have never been any dates available. I tried using the online counseling service and have never received a response. I'm in my second semester and I don't even know if I'm taking the right classes because I've never spoken with a counselor.

I also almost spent 260.00 on a book that the bookstore had labeled as a required text for one of my classes. It would have been a final sale. Luckily, I went to class before purchasing it and learned that they are no longer using that book. Even though the bookstore had it clearly labeled under that class/section number.

Every aspect of this school, besides the actual classes are just unorganized and unsympathetic. I guess you shouldn't expect much from a community college, but I'd expect a little more of any place I'm giving money.< /Text>

<Text>Please don't take the David Sanchez class. He is so unprofessional and love calling his female students. He love stalking his female students.

<text>I like LACC.. It offers reasonable courses for credit or non credited classes..i.e ESL (English Second Lang)..music..martial arts..yoga..fitness..and more!! Parking is tricky. Secure car if left to park on street.  There is improvenrnt last few years..more attractive..better security. Good enhancement for many careers starters. I have taken several classes here..they were very rewarding and helped in my career to increase income..instructor was great. Good non credit classes ..Piano and Pilates was reasonable and great..this was a few years ago tho. But I have seen rosters and keep up as I have also take n intermittent personal interest classes  (culinary, fictional writing and marketing).Nice school. DO NOT WALK ALONE OUTSIDE AFTER DARK UNESCORTED..NEIGHBORHOOD IS SKETCHY..FOR BOTH GIRLS AND BOYS!!!  BOYS ARE VICTIMS TOO.< /text><rating>4</rating>< pics>

This school’s administration is full of irresponsible people who don’t know what they’re doing. One person passes the blame onto another, that person onto another, and it’s all one vicious cycle.

The counselors give you incorrect guidance (they don’t seem to know UC or CSU requirements), please beware that you should speak to multiple counselors just to cross check that what you’re being told is accurate. Also, keep in mind that if you make afternoon appointments with counselors they might “call in sick” without bothering to ask someone to contact their appointments so they can save themselves the trip ( I lost an afternoon of work, gas, and time because of a counselor’s inability to let me know that he wasnt going to meet me for our scheduled appointment).

The Admissions and Records as well as Financial Aid offices are as helpful as speaking to a blind deaf mute. You go, and you go, and you go, trying to get answers to simple questions like, why hasn’t my home school been changed since I came in early February to have it changed? They send you from one office to another and not even they have the answer to that (thank God they at least have all the offices in one building). I’ve gone to try and change my home school from Trade Tech to LACC on five separate occasions and nothing yet. Oh, and forget about calling the offices, they will never answer.

Yet SURPRISINGLY they need to increase their enrollment rates because it’s been decreasing for some time now. Weirdly, though , with the new system in use students are “accidentally” enrolled in courses they never signed up for.  Then students are later berated by school staff as to why they never bothered to show up to class when you try to petition the courses you originally never signed up for (btw tracking down some of the Professors is more appropriate a job for a private investigator than a student).

Avoid the school if you can, I will transfer out as soon as is possible for me.< /Text>

Location is getting worse. There is an increase in homeless people around campus. Professors have become MUCH worse. For the first time, I reported a professor (Spanish professor Leyva) and NOTHING was done about it. It's so awful here! I am looking for classes at ELAC, when talking to a security officer about what to do about what my professor was doing to me, she told me to just go to ELAC and that's why she takes no classes here. I am not going to be attending this college anymore. Taking courses at Los Angeles Southwest college and their Child Development program is SO much better. This place has nothing to offer I suggest going elsewhere.< /Text>

If you can talk to the students attending there and find out what teachers are good it would be in your best interest because my math teachers teaching techniques are soo bad that I might fail the class if I don't teach the subject to myself.</Review></record></dataset><record>

I enjoyed attending this college! It is straightforward and there are so many classes. I was pregnant as soon as I finished high school so I decided to enroll at LACC and completed courses on campus and many more online. After 2 years, I am happy to say that this school has helped me transfer to USC !! Thank you LACC!</review>

The class i took was excellent but the financial aid department is garbage! they've sent my higher one card to an address which i never gave them and basically have me fending for myself with no type of help or services to correcting their mistakes. I'm frustrated dealing with a institution that does not want to help with their own faults and i have to buy books for my class. I am dropping myself from this school in total this week. Thanks LACC for nothing<//text>

Its probably due to 19 but my transcript never got scanned by two colleges in lacc.  It was there quite a bit early.  I'm supposed to get two AA I doubt I'll get any now.  I took over 33 credits in cinema and had the cinematography certificate.  However I got very little assistance to get the cinema AA even though it's the same requirements.  I had a little more classes I still wanted to take but probably will stop going to school due to the lack of ability to get assistance when I had met the requirements.

Also don't take okamara for photography.

I had really liked this school and thought it was a good school.  After finally getting an internship I asked a basic question about being in a two credit class am I getting credits for my internship in addtion to that. While I got email replies the school has not been able to give me a appropriate answer in a week. Even the dean just told me I was registered. I had actually considered dropping my internship but I got something in my area finally.  It's so sad many people have jobs here and just don't do them.

Ps when u go to a class and listen to people ask questions for five hours you are basically listening to questions its not really a class.  I don't go to listen to questions and its a waist of my time and learning to do so.

Read Juan Caro review and I even made suggestions too the faculty much of it was just swept under because it's more work for them and they even had a class I took which would incorporate it.  Faculty didn't really care or at all respond even when I took the remote class which would do the sports lacc had.

I actually believe some staff just reply to emails without reading them even if you complain they don't read that.< /Review>

This college is awesome and everyone is so nice and caring for one another. PS: I recommend you should take this classes if you haven’t already English 28-101 professor William Lemon, Art 201 professor sandy de lissovoy, history 86 professor Bertha Medrano, and public speaking communication 101 professor micheal Kalustian trust these classes are easy but challenging.</text>

The Counselors give out wrong information regarding the classes I need to take to graduate and transfer to the CSU I got accepted into. They also give students false information and the staff doesn't even know the updates they place for student information. I seen a disabled person walking lost because the staff didn't know where the orientation was for her. I felt so bad. She couldn't walk a lot but they still didn't mind giving her the run around. Smh. They need to communicate better with each other. Also the hours they display they should be there on time for those hours! This is my last semester, Thank God!<//review>

They for some reason had 2 ID's under my name.
I had hard time pulling my transcript due to this reason.
and all she was able to tell me was, "Just email us, i'll respond within 10 business days".

Great cinema programs, especially for the price. Mr walzer(humanities), Mcevety(kinesiology) B.m. Medrano (history) and Danielle Stallings(cinema) are just a few of the notable staff. This is also one of the most diverse colleges in the country. I highly recommend LACC. I would have given LACC 5 stars but the library computers are garbage.< /Review>

< Review>
The restrooms in the science building have no locks. Waiting on the admissions and records and Financial Aid Office is way too long and they aren't helpful. I've been trying to pay my classes for a month now, the business lady says "You are not on the system, go down to tell Admissions Office". I wait 30 min and she can't hep me and that's her only answer. Not Helpful at all.< /Review>

<text>Overall I like this school a lot. I would have gave it four stars but I'll explain my reasons. I do give it 4 stars for the education to price ratio, it is probably one of the best investments IF you know what you want to do in life.

It's almost impossible to get the important transferrable college unit classes you need because of over crowding (which is typical for Jr.Colleges). But there are too many students who are not serious about education, so they take up space in a class, and end up dropping within a month. e.g. On average i have had three classes that were packed full of 40+ students, by the middle of semester my class sizes dwindled down to less than 20 (sadly los angeles dropout rates are so high). Now I understand that this is the student's fault not the school's but i disagree because the registration dates for students seemed to be done by raffle and not by gpa/units completed. And they need to add more prerequisite for the intensive science classes (they say they have changed it starting 2014 but we'll see).

Theres always construction. Never ending construction. You would think that this a good think but it's only good if the construction doesn't lasts years. when I started going to this school there was construction, my sister who went 4 years before said there was a lot construction too. I kind of just wish the work was done so we could have more available classes. Also the quality of professors is sporadic, theres are a lot extremely capable well informed professional professor, mixed with lousy ones, and there seems to be few who are in between. I have passed a class leaving with the thought of "what the hell did i just learn anyways?" from this class.. not a really good feeling considering I'm paying to be educated and not paying to just earn free units.<//text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
international student center is a total joke and they dont want to help you.
they are kind only to their russian fellas because they dont have to speak english to them.
except for one lady who was helpful and nice, all of them are rude and stuck up two faces
international students are paying way more money than regular students and they are treated as little kids who dont deserve to be in there.
staff themselves has huge accent and are not good at english, but when international  student who just arrived to this country, go to the office and ask a question, and of course they have accent and make mistakes, ask to repeat the sentence again because its not their native language! then they look at them like a dumbass and give that face and voice tone.
this is total waste of money and time.
If students who are considering to come to this school from another country reconsider it. just go to college that is in your country and get the better education and be treated as an equal human being.<//review>

Ive found that the best thing to do, is always,check your answered questions, and get second opinions, talk to a student already there, if your waiting in a line for 6 hours, you could exchange phone numbers, or conversations, with others, to see how things are going and get feedback..the night before, write down,all questions, and then ask the person, who is answering your question, pertinent after questions, like is there a possible problem with this, "Am I asking the question I need to ask...etc etc...hey, thats the way the world, works,and as for the gentelman, who said, student and faculty were sick, blowing their noses, etc..really? okay, here goes, maybe wear a mask like they do in the asian countries, so you dont catch or pass germs (see pandemic,comming down the pike,Hey it could happen, ,its called thinning the herd..LOL) wash your hands!! institutions, are filthy...everything you touch, has had hands, that have not washed, then you bring that,hand and pinky to your face and nose...voila..now your sick, I like soap and water..better than the bacterial gels, but its more convienent..carry it, also note, bacterial gels, dont work over the long haul..(look it up) it doesnt kill germs after a while (soap and H2 0) is the best...ps. those antibacterial soaps, also affect the thyroids, (look it up) yea, washing your hands, with that, stuff...affects the function of your thyroids..saw it in a magazine, and heard it once on the telly..so people...you have to take "RESPONSILBILTY" for your own "SELF" your out in the world now...you think,la city college is bad, try taking your pal, to the verterans hospital...talk about shifless, and just dont give a rats petutti...so I wonder why doesnt someone, get a website and charge monies, to assist the kids, down in the line, to make it easier,for them to get their answers and the like?? that would be a job? right? you could pass out flyers to the people waiting in the line...hey look,you made a new job, or something....oh and lastly..perhaps people waiting on you at the school, would be a little bit nicer, if people would say things, like..Good Morning, how are you...and then, please...and then,. Thankyou...at the end. I use to wait on the public..waitressed. sometimes, I wanted to ask...but thought it in my head..."was the ground cold, when you got up this morning"  so now! go out there and be kind to your fellow humans, politness,goes a long way.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I love it since they have None credit classes, something I saw that I have not seen in other schools, is that if you take the GED class and have good attendance and get a good percentage, they give you the opportunity to take the free exam. Which I have not seen in other schools.

Me encanta ya que tienen clases de None credito,algo que vi que no e visto en otros colegios, es que si tomas la clase de el GED y tienes buena asistencia y sacas buen porcentaje enclase, te dan la oportunidad de tomar el examen gratis. Cosa que no e visto en otros colegio.< /text>

<Review>If I can give this place a zero I will! I waited for more than an hour then they told be you should wear sneakers. Why they didn’t told me that when I try to show my paperwork I could even get my shoes. How will I know what they need from me if they don’t even bother to look at my paperwork. Staff are rude also. I’m not surprise about the rate. Who ever managing this medical center you better train your staff.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<rating>1</rating><review>Immediate Care? No, absolutely not. This clinic poses as an urgent care but in reality, it is a worker's comp clinic and the rest of us just get to sit in our car for 2 hours until they decide it is our turn. The waiting list is arbitrary, I come in 1 hour after checking in and there are 9 people ahead of me. I come in another hour later, as no one has bothered to call me yet to let me know when my turn is coming up, and I still have 7 people ahead of me. I asked the lady at the front (Annette) to wait in a chair the third time I came in and she said those are for "injured" patients only; meanwhile, the entire waiting room was empty with one man sitting down. I asked to speak with their manager who is conveniently not in until next Tuesday. Their corporate number goes to nowhere, there is not even an operator to direct you to the corporate office for a complaint. This is a bad business and they have no etiquette and little professionalism towards new clients. Their slogan should be "Prolonged Waiting Time for Non-Worker's Comp Patients" and "We do not respect new clients."<//review>< date>

<Review>Been reading the past reviews while waiting at this clinic for more than 2 hours now. It kept me entertained lol. But yea, you'll spend all day here. I would say don't come here for physical, but what's the point if your employer sends you here. Ugghh. Some of the staff were nice though.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I was here yestrrday and was told to come back today, Ive been waiting here in my car since 1230pm which they said the time that I need to go back for my physical but it is already 2pm now and I still didnt hear any phone call. Plus the 2 guy front desk are not so nice. I dont know I wish my pre placement physical is with something else!

Update is has been 2hrs now I went there and they just started to ask me to fill out some paper works 😩😫

If theres a negative star I would, it is wasting peoples precious time!!! They wont even let me wait inside

I called since it has already been 2hrs 30mins and the guy I spoke to said theyve been very busy yesterday and today and said you have to wait, bye and dropped the call!!!! wooow it has never been like this in any of the clinics Ive been to ☹️ so rude!

Total wait is 6hrs!!!!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

So I read the reviews before coming and honestly was disappointed my job was sending me here. But honestly it turned out perfectly fine.

They see people with injuries first so have patience.

The staff was not rude when I went ... thankful for that much. Some<//review>

I came here after an emergency work accident. I waited over 30 minutes, which was inconvenient with a bleeding injury, but considering the high volume of patients I was understanding.

The front desk staff were all very nice and helpful. The medical staff were polite too, but the doctor and the nurse didn't seem to get along with each other which made me uncomfortable. The procedure was done quickly and painlessly.

I was planning to give 3/5 stars, but I'll add one because I ended up needing to cancel a follow-up visit, and they let me reschedule without any fuss.<//Text>

<Review>I got hurt early in the morning and was the first one there. I needed stitches & was bleeding. The wait was 15 minutes max because they had to fill out papers. They stitched me, updated my shot record and did a Xray to make sure everything was okay. The doctor was very professional & did a great job with the stitching. the nurse was very calming. I guess it just depends on how serious you're Injured & they take their time to make sure every patient is well taken care of.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dd32f131176a9b:0xa510c828159b0c28<//gmap_id><user>115929895264973021073< /user>< Resp>

My personal experience was exceptional. Arrive for a work related incident where I sliced the top of my hand down to the tendon. After the initial wait time for my companies authorization to be seen (1-1/2 hrs), I was in right away. The staff was very professional and friendly. If you have a personality, be friendly, smile and engage with them. Be the exception and make someone else’s day. Been there three times now and I have absolutely no complaints.
I asked why some people sit in the waiting room longer? It was explained to me that someone who comes in bleeding gets priority over a non-life threatening incident. Also, if you have a prior appointment or a follow-up appointment, you will be seen sooner. Although, I’m not too sure why drug screen takes so much time? That should be corrected.< /review>

It is concerning too see how many individuals post about the waiting time at this location. It looks like most of the issues is with DT walk-ins. I experienced this myself today. I arrived at 8:30a and sign up. The front desk lady advised me I will be called in a moment. She call me at 9:18am stamp on my paper and passed me some paperwork to fill out. I ended leaving the place at 11:50am. They should take appointments over the phone or online. This is a complete lack of respect. I hope management take the opportunity to fix this issue. I am sure they have in place already an appointment system. Please use it for DTs.< /Text>

<review>The staff here is very rude. With the exception of a few. The doctor Mr. Robert Cha, was rude. He came in not introducing whom he was and also just began to ask me questions, but before I could even answer the questions he made it seem as if there was a problem with what I stated in my paperwork. He then thus stated that “ I am the one making the decisions if your ok or not!”

I’m not sure where they got their professional license from but I would not refer anyone to come to this place for any reason! If there could be a negative 1 I would have used that.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<text>A little over two hours for a urine drug screening test (which takes less than a minute to pee in a cup) is ridiculous.  If you have the option of taking your test somewhere else, I highly recommend it.  When I asked the lady at the front desk (about waiting for an hour) how much longer it might be, because I really had to go since I drank about half a liter prior to arriving, she simply pointed me towards their restrooms.  That solution took me by surprise since that would mean I would not be able to submit my urine sample and would have to come back, and when I pointed that out to her she simply said "then you're going to have to keep waiting."  As you can see, they're very helpful.</text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Maybe about 5 min tops, less than a min to receive a injection, 4 min including walking past the door and having them fill out the form, and then walking out. You’d think you’d be in and out (not like the enjoyable burger joint out here in California) but nope.... you will spend hours upon hours here. The last time I came I was waiting from 2pm to 7pm for a drug screen which I had to retake because they sent it out wrong.... but anyways you will see many different types of people come in and walk out. People of different races, ethnicities, even scents. If you are a writer or a novelist I suggest you come to this clinic. You can overthink life. You can people watch. You can converse with others over similar frustrations such as the long long wait. You can also waste time if you’re just bored of being home. If you aren’t a writer though I’d suggest you go elsewhere. Some place with a better work ethic. A place that considers your time as worthy/ valuable.

That’s my input here. I can’t disclose any more information based on my observation or experience as they are both personal to me and may be completely biased... so if you want you can experience this all on your own.< /Review>< Pics>

Tip (Especially for those going in for pre employment or DOT testing) be patient. It will pay off.

<Text>Don't ever come here. In all seriousness, this place is a joke. I went in for a drug screening, which I understand does not get priority over those that have actual medical issues and need to see a doctor. I'm fully aware of a somewhat lengthy wait time. BUT, when you have 5 receptionists and ONE DOCTOR, what the hell are y'all actually doing??!??! There were people there that needed care and had been waiting over 5 HOURS. The receptionist I spoke to lied to me and told me the wait was "2 hours".... No the wait time is "over 5 hours"!!! You know you only have one doctor back there!! Stop BSing your clients!! I get it, you don't want to deal with us. You don't feel like being bothered by us. You're just there to collect a check and pay your rent. We can die in the street and piss our pants for all these people care. Still, it's your job. Maybe, just maybe, act like you actually care and want to work there and it's not just a place to collect a paycheck from?? Fire some. if not all, of the receptionists and MAYBE, just maybe, crazy idea here.....hire some more doctors to, I dunnnnno, see your patients?!?!?!? I have never been to place where it took more than 30 minutes for me to pee in a cup. -_- Stay away. Go anywhere else. Do not give this place anymore business. They need to learn a lesson. Maybe when the money starts drying up then maybe something will change.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>dr.s are very unprofessional.  I witnessed one male doctor yelling at the staff in front of everyone.  The doctors are there for a check. they are not concerned if you are better or not. I could go more into detail but I actually like some of the staff there and wouldn't want to mention anything about them. stay clear of this place if you really in need of treatment<//review>< Pics>

<Text>The worst medical clinic  and medical care ever. The staff  including the drs are extremely rude. Nooone in the medical field should ever treat their patient like i was. First the dr spoke down about my profession belittling  me compared to his  31 years of medical experience. He then proceeds to get extremely rude saying i was not cooperating, because i told him i cant walk. Tells me hes discharging me and i need to find a new provider. Honestly you probably get better  medical care in the county.<//Text>< pictures>

Great surgeon. But some staff members are rude and speak disrespectfully to you. Specifically a "nurse" who has 45 yrs of experience has no compassion.</Text>

I went for a drug screening for employment and the front desk receptionist Jenny was extremely rude to me , I should her my email that stated I did not need a form and she would not look up my information . Finally when I got this situation done , I went to see the collector for my urine sample, knowing that I am there for employment you think she would be a little nicer, she made me feel like a criminal. Worst experience ever.<//Review>

This place is an absolute disgrace. Subject to random drug testing, I assume my company uses this dump because it's inexpensive. I have sat in the inadequate waiting room for as little as one and a half hours and as much as two hours for a urine test. The staffing is insufficient and sometimes rude. Sick paitents are mixed with well ones. The clientele are listening to music and playing game with the volume on despite signs prohibiting the practice. I was even challenged to a fight because I was "standing in his spot." I hate this place and truly hope it burns down.</Review>

<Review>DO NOT GO HERE! My boyfriend was actively bleeding from slicing his hand and they said they would refuse to look at him till we could pay upfront or confirm insurance. Had to wait till we could get insurance card from his father. Still waiting for them to see him still haven’t even confirmed the insurance would work. Disgusting this company is and this country would let people bleed out because of money.</Review>< gmap_id>

One of the doctor' there is very unprofessional he was screaming at his employees he wasn't wearing an id badge, so I don't know his name. I felt bad the way he was treating his people what A lack of leadership. A older doctor here messed up my paper work so I had to go to another location of these immediate medical centers. And that was a bad move. The other doctor was just as bad. I won't be using these centers anymore.</text>

<Review>Horrible service, rude staff. I sat there for over 2.5hrs for a pre-employment drug screen and then had to leave at 530pm to pickup my child. I seen people check in, be seen and leave. I was told that because they had injuries and sickness that they would be seen first. Horrible service<//Review>< Pics>

<review>The doctor isn’t keeping patient issues private. He speaks loudly to them in the waiting area so I’m hearing about people’s scabs, rashes, and private issues.

I’ve never waited so long for a urinalysis. I wish  I chose a different care center with less temperamental intake receptionist.<//review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

I was involve in a car accident and I was referred by my insurance  to this urgent care.  I was treated as a cash patient because they were unable to verify my insurance.  The customer service received from registration to back office service was terrible.  First of all,the doctor's bedside manner was terrible.  She refused to evaluate all the body parts affected during the car accident.  They sent me to have an x-ray which they never gave me results and my attending doctors have not been able to obtain.  My insurance carrier had to assist me in obtaining my refund which took over a month.  They were quick to threaten to send me to collections if I did not pay my co payment.  I returned to their office to request my record, it's been over a month, and I have not been able to leave a message or speak to Christina who is in charge of the medical records Dept. I work in the medical field, and I advise you to avoid going to this office.  Which has proven to me  that they are unwilling to focus on customer patient care and are rude.</Text>

<text>Same as most of the other reviews. I went in for a routine non-dot urine and tb test. Waited 1.5 hours and there were still 8 people ahead of me and I had to leave. I came back next day, same thing. Waited another 1.5 hours and finally had to go to an appointment. During the time I was there, the receptionist would actually hold up her hand to indicate to people standing at the desk to wait while she took personal calls on her phone. I went back today and there was a sign on the door stating the place was closed "...due to unforeseen circumstances..." I had to go elsewhere to get my test and tb.  Do not go to this place unless you have 3-4 hours to burn and don't mind being treated like garbage.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Service at Immediate Medical Care is their worse I have ever received in my entire life! I went because my employer has hired them for Workman's Compensation Issues.   The supervisor at Immediate Medical Care was a man who screamed and yelled as his secretary in the front office in front of all the employers.  When a patient took exception to how he spoke to his help,the doctor because screaming and abusing the patient.   On my third visit, a doctor discharged me from care without any explanation.  When I asked for an explanation,he came out to the reception area and ,he replied, "You can reapply".  I asked him multiple times why he was discharging me if I was still in pain.  He gave me the same answer.  After a year of pain, I reapplied and discovered I had a torn meniscus.  I had to beg for the treatment that discovered the torn meniscus.  I spent close to three years trying to "prove" to them that I wasn't lying but injured. Worse possible treatment! The "physical therapy" was another disappointment.  Every patient got the exact same treatment. Go behind the curtain, do you exercises, call when finished for electric treatment, maybe sonogram, see you next week.</review>< Pics>

<text>Got sent here when I got a back injury at work waited hours to be seen. Then when the doctor would see me he would look at me for 2min say your fine you shouldnt be feeling pain anymore. Well I dont control that now do I. Who are you to tell me when I do and don't feel pain. Especially after looking at me for 2min not exaggerated. Also have heard doctors openly talking about sexual things while I was back there. Like how unprofessional are you. Advice dont go here at all costs.< /text></record>

Horrible customer service, had them as my primary service agent and I absolutely regret it! Never received anything on time and when I would request certain things it ONLY took numerous and repetitive calls and emails just to get someone to get my requests. Found out they were of absolute no use what so ever during an FAA audit, they failed to provide and communicate with me on almost everything.< /Review>

<Text>Biased doctors, I went in for a drug and dot physical. Doctor made me jump through hoops  to prove that I had been sober for the time I stated. I had to go to my rehab facility, personal doctors office and ask people who knew me and ask them to attest in writing that I had been sober for that time....all for what? So that he could fail me because I didn't write on the form that I was taking a pain medication weeks before for an injury. Mind you, I had stopped the meds 3 weeks prior.....so there was no need to disclose. Needless to say, office did not apologize, failed me and stood by their biased doctor....who obviously treated me diffrently once he read I was a recovering addict. Ask your new employer to send you to a different provider. Staff suck, long wait, and horrible service!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

This place is terrible the male doctors do not care about your well-being. This  place is all about getting you in and getting you out. I was treated with so much disrespect. It's about getting a paycheck there. If your employer tells you to go there when you receive a work injury. Run ASAP..</review>

AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!! No care or compassion, you are just a file number to them. Drs aren't even MD they are "assistants". Wait time is ridiculously long and then exam is 1 minute. They send you off to work when you are sick. Never admit any mistakes and blow people off. Can't believe they are still operating.<//review>

I ignored all the reviews and went ahead to have a drug test at this center.
And sorry guys for not honoring your reviews.

This center is really not even worth 1* rating. As said by many, everyone wants to escape from their responsibilities.

No one want to take the test. They just kept me waiting and finally said machine is not working.

Came to know that someone by name Jesse is manager here. Would like to take this issue to his notice .< /Text>

Not actually 24hr urgent care. I showed up after seeing 24hr on both google and their website only to find a paper sign on a locked door saying urgent care services are from 8-6 (I think that was the hours on the sign).<//review>

This place is 7-5 (doctors words).  NOT 24 hours so don't listen to the internet. My roommate has a rather large piece of glass in his foot and the doctor wouldn't see him. If I could leave no stars I would.<//Review>

The wait is for at least 2 1/2 hours and they are very rude
They don’t go in order the place is always full and most of the time  there is no chairs available
If they don’t want to assist you they will say that you have to come another day
And the fake blonde Mexican is the one that yells at people
If you speak Spanish they get racist and pretend they don’t know the language and 5 minutes later they are speaking Spanish< /review>

DO NOT GO HERE FOR A DRUG TEST!!! You will be put on the back burner and could possibly be here for hours like me and many others (according to the other reviews). This is a workers comp facility and if you are here for anything other than that, forget it! The two stars is because the lady in the front was friendly.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) And I am putting this message today on 9/17/2015 I don't know why it appears that it is from last week.

I didn't like the help service that place offers at all.

Dr. Thomas Roccapalumbo is a very unpleasant person and does not have a good way to treat the patient. I am now residing the service of that place because I injured my left arm on 8/20/15 and had only three visits with them and two of them I met with this doctor that I already mentioned and he always treats me very badly. He expresses himself loudly and doesn't let one explain anything to him ... Besides, he measures the pain in my arm by squeezing my shoulder and that's not fair.
Today it is said to your face. Because he directly told me that he would give me a cortizone injection. God knows what it is? And I asked him to first let me finish my physical therapy, which I just started on Monday the 14th of this month and I only have two more sessions left. And he flatly said no. Injection is better than therapy.
To which I replied that another doctor from the same place had recommended that I first do physical therapy and then take the injection into account.

That place is incredibly inhuman. Since they don't care how one feels, they just want to register you and charge for their work and that's it.

Y este mensage lo estoy poniendo hoy dia 9/17/2015 no se porque aparese que es de la semana pasada.

No me gusto para nada el servicio de ayuda que ofrese ese lugar .

El doctor thomas roccapalumbo es una perzona muy desagradable y no tiene una buena manera de tratar al pasiente . Yo ahoramismo estoy resiviendo el servicio de ese lugar porq me lastime mi brazo izquierdo el dia 8/20/15  e tenido solo tres visitas con ellos y dos de ellas me toco con este doctor que ya mencione y siempre meda muy mal trato .  El se expresa a gritos y no deja que uno le explique nada... Aparte el mide el dolor de mi brazo apretando mi hombro y eso no es justo.
Hoy se dige en su cara.  Porq el directamente me dijo que me pondria una inyeccion de cortizona . Sabra dios que es ?   Y le pedi que primero me dejara terminar con my physical therapy que apenas la empese el lunes 14. De este mes y me quedan solo dos seciones mas. Y el tajantemente me dijo no .  La inyeccion es mejor que la terapia .
A lo que yo le conteste que otro doctor de ese mismo lugar me habia recomendado que primero hisiera la physical therapy y despues tomaria encuenta la inyeccion.

Ese lugar es increiblemente inumano . Ya que no les importa como se sienta uno  ellos solo quieren darte de alta y cobrar su trabajo y ya.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<Review>I absolutely loved this place! My lashes came out exactly how I wanted and I was able to give my personal preference before hand. It’s so professional, done quickly and effortlessly. Right when I walked in they were welcoming me and the atmosphere was so calming and clean. I will probably be recommending this place to my mom and sister. My experience was excellent and I will be returning. I highly recommend!</Review><UserId.>102998397776842922330</UserId.>< rate>

<review>I have been coming to PRIM for several years now. If I do nothing else for myself, I get my lashes done. I have tried other lash places and the lashes didnt last, stylists were too heavy handed causing me to have a headache cause they rested their arm on my forehead. NEVER have I had that experience at PRIM. I LOVE Elena, shes gentle and my lashes last. Every time I go I feel like family.<//review><UserId.>110800576259777018520</UserId.>< Rating>

I have no words to express my appreciation for this place. Their work is clean, professional and most important THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS...before you pay for the services and after!! I recently did my eyebrows and I have received lots of great complements even from other eyebrow artists! It feels great to finally have a place I can fully trust with my lash extensions and eyebrows!! I highly recommend it...you won't regret it!</text>

Krista is great! My lashes look dainty & I love it! PRIM is always A+ with service & execution! I love this beautiful place! Lately I’ve enjoyed shopping in the boutique for cute tops and candles before my appointment...you must call and make an appointment for lashes (ask for Krista) & microblading!</text>

I don't usually write reviews, but after my experience at PRIM I felt compelled to communicate how great this place is and what an amazing customer experience they provide. From the lovely atmosphere, to the friendly staff, to the level of professional craft, PRIM is the full package. I had my eyebrows micro bladed and they look amazing. The process was thoroughly explained and took the time to make sure each stroke was perfect. I will be going back for additional services and highly recommend this place to anyone considering one of the services they offer.< /Review>

My lashes are beautiful!  I got the volume lashes and they are so lush and gorgeous! They only use premium products and it shows! You won’t regret it! Brie is awesowe! She is very professional and knowledgeable as well. I had some concerns about the my sensitive eyes, she listened and took extra time to mist and fan my eyes throughout and made sure that I was comfortable the whole time.  The staff are great! I can’t rave enough about my experience here!< /text>

Wow, I can hardly believe it's been one year since I found PRIM and the joy of having lush thick lashes.  As a blond with nearly invisible fine lashes, this new addiction (it's a good addiction) helps me feel a bit more put together as I race out the door to go teach my fitness classes.  My lash goddess, Krista, is amazing.  She makes my eyes 'pop' with her mad lash skills.  The entire staff are friendly and knowledgeable .  I always feel welcome and comfortable when I come in for my appointments.< /Text>

This was my first time at Prim and my first experience having a hydra facial. I absolutely loved the whole experience and felt really refreshed, restored and happy with results. I booked A return appointment with Monica and wish i knew about this years ago. The atmosphere is so pleasant and welcoming and staff was very accommodating. I guess It’s never to late to start and it was a confident booster.  Thank you- Candy Feliz< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I have been getting my lashes done at PRIM Lash & Beauty Studio for 6 months now and I couldn’t be any happier with them! Camille is great!!! She always listens to my concerns and am always beyond satisfied after every appointment. I get a refill every 2 weeks, and I could possibly go longer but I just prefer it that way. The lashes are great quality, no clumps or pre-mature fallouts. This is definitely the place to go! Inquire about their membership too!!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Review>I got Microblading done today by Jani. They look great!! I love, love, love them.  The process was so much easier then I had heard and seen online.
She exceeded my expectation.
I will be recommending Prim Lash & Beauty Studio to all my family and friend.
I will be going back to get my eyelashes done next.
Thank you<//Review>< rating>

Accent Awnings produces a solid product and sells it for a reasonable price.  I saw their operation in person, and it is quite sophisticated - nothing makeshift about it.  Their sales staff seems attentive to the customer's needs rather than trying to upsell the bells & whistles.  The shades were delivered a couple of weeks faster than promised and installed efficiently, with a few tweaks to best suit my situation.  Communication from start to finish was timely and courteous.  I came away with an excellent impression of the firm and its staff.<//Text>

We have been using Accent Awnings for the past 8-9 years.  Everywhere in our home where we can use any awnings to block out the hot California sun, we have it installed by this company.  Shaun has been our sale rep for the last few times span over the past 7 years, and I can not express enough how wonderful Shaun has been. Shaun is extremely humble, respectful, professional, absolutely polite, knowledgeable and caring. We are quite happy with his absolutely genuine professional polite, respectful manner of working and very good pricing options. Recently, we also ordered a customized drop down awning for our large balcony door facing West to block out the hot sun in the afternoon. I must say that it is installed by a team of three technicians, Juan, Hugo and another technician whose name I did not get. They were absolutely amazing, chop chop and everything was done.  They cleaned up afterward. The drop down awning is absolutely beautiful and block out 99.5% of the sun, still we can see everything through that awning.  All the awnings are customized made by this company to fit my exact needed area for blocking out the sun.  Beautiful fabrics and colors and different designs are made to our desire.  This company seems to have the same staff that stay with company for a very long time.  It is good to work with same people who you have a very good relationship with for many years.  Highly recommend this company!!!< /Text>

The installers were great when they put my outdoor window/door screen. It works perfectly and it's going to be great when summer comes around and that west side window/slider gets the full heat of the sun. It's going to make a huge difference and this is the first time that I'm really looking forward to the summertime. I wished I had thought of installing this type of outdoor window/door treatment years ago. It would have saved me tons of money from the sun destroying all the inside window treatments that I had to keep purchasing because of UV ray ruining the fabric. So this screen will the perfect fix.</Review>

We ordered a shade for our sliding glass door.  Every person we dealt with was a professional.  The shade was delivered on time and installed on the date and time stated.  The quality of the shade is wonderful and made an immediate impact in the room.  We will be purchasing more shades.<//Review>

We are very happy with our new awning for our pergola.   It really helps to block out the afternoon sun over our patio and so we can open our dining room's sliding doors.  It looks great and works well, but we should have sprung for the electric opener.  It's a hassle to crank it up and down every day.<//review>

Top grade materials!  VERY competent installers! The shop put the crank on the wrong side but the installers efficiently made the transfer when the shade was over halfway installed.  We will place another order after another Alumawood beam is installed.<//text>

Our order was delivered on time, and Hugo and Juan installed the awnings in the time frame that was given to us. The work involved mounting two awnings on the second floor level. The awning look great, and are securely mounted. We are very pleased with Accent Awnings.< /review>

They came and picked up my old awnings that I have purchased from them 10 years ago.  This is the third time in 15 years that I have had them redone.  They do amazing work and we are so excited to get them back on the house.  Thank you so much for doing them so quickly.  You guys are amazing.</Text>

I can’t say enough about the awesome experience I had with Accent Awnings. I had my existing awnings taken down so that I could put new siding on my home. I never thought it would be such a difficult time to find a awning co to reinstall awnings. I called at least 6 awning companies in Orange County and most said no . The few that said yes tried to price gouge me.

My luck changed when I talked to Adam at Accent Awnings. He returned my call which was in itself amazing based on my experience with the other awning companies. He sympathized with what I was going through and was able to squeeze me in on his calendar in 2 weeks.

The installers came on time, and it took 3 hours to install. A big shout out to Andrew, Salvador and Chana . They all were very professional , accommodating and did some extra things that they did not have to do. Could not have asked for a better team of installers.

If you are looking for a company that thinks long term , is very fair with price, and is really customer  serviced oriented, don’t bother calling anyone else other than Accent Awnings. They may have not made a lot of money helping me out this time, but I know who to call the next time my awnings start ripping and more importantly I will always refer friends and family to them. Thanks again.. Adam, Andrew, Chavarin’s Salvador.< /text>

<Review>Have used Accent Awnings for numerous installations of awnings and shades at my house since 1994.  Always experienced excellent service - and this time was not exception:  installers were very professional and took great care in positioning cables and junction boxes in the best possible way, very neatly aligned - something you definitely would like to see more often in construction.  Could not  think of how to do it better. Very satisfied *yet again!)!<//Review>< pics>

Juan and his fellow installer were awesome. They did a detailed installation and were communicative throughout the process. Their clean up was excellent too. I highly recommend Accent Awnings. We are very happy with the quality and operation of the motorized  awnings. Thank you!</Review>

I inquired about a drop shade for my patio.  Jim came out a provided a very competitive quote and came out again to answer some questions I had.  I selected Accent Awnings because of the quality of their products and the exceptional customer service Jim provided.  When it came time for installation their team was on time, professional and completed the installation sooner than quoted.  Not to mention the product was beautifully installed.  I highly recommend this company.</Review>

<review>I talked with several neighbors and their recommendations were good.  Great sales guy and although the manufacture time was about 7 weeks, they were right on time. The install went very smoothly.The guys were courteous and concerned with the holes (1) they had to drill into the stucco.  It makes a huge difference with the morning sun now not blasting into the house.  TV reflection is gone. The birds will have a difficult time crashing into the reflection of the mountains and sky now.  Thanks guys!< /review>< Pics>

Shaun Moore showed us all of our choices and was very helpful. The installation team was outstanding. They had our awning up in no time and held it up so we could decide on the best height and position. Thanks to Salvador, Salvador & Martin.
We are very happy with the finished product.< /Text>

What a terrific experience we had with AA! While it took 7 weeks from ordering to installation (industry standard now a days) we couldn't be happier with the end result. The shade is everything they promised and we're now wishing for hot weather to return so we can use it. The installers, Waldo and Martine were on time, very professional, we’e wearing masks, cleaned up after themselves and answered any questions we had. We highly recommend AA!<//Review>

The  company's (all) employees were very nice, they called back every time I reached out and always had the answer to my questions, The installers were the best. Waldo was very helpful and they left the place as clean as it was when they left. I would highly recommend for your canvas needs.

This is the second time I have purchased from Accent Awnings. Both times, purchase and installation went like clockwork. The woman on the phone even provided suggestions on what awning colors to pick since I was so indecisive. Wait time, delivery and installation was exactly what they told me.< /text>

<date>1556577830518< /date><Pics>None< /Pics><Review>Accent Awnings Awnings provided excellent customer service from the first phone call setting up an estimate appointment to the final installation. The receptionist set up an appointment for the next day. The estimator arrived on time and prepared. I was happy with his on site drawing of my awnings and price quote. By the end of the day I had received an e-mail with a hard copy invoice with installation date. On installation day, the crew was on time, clean, worked efficiently and answered all of my questions. My Accent Awnings are beautiful. After 6 months of installation everything is in good working order and condition. I cannot recommend Accent Awnings highly enough. Anyone in need of awnings should call Accent Awnings today!</Review><username>Linda Colley</username>< Rating>

Accent Awnings did an excellent job manufacturing and installing motorized drop down exterior shades. We have large windows in the back of our house and the new shades are fantastic! During the hot and sunny times of the day we push a button and the shades drop down to keep the house cooler and less sun glare. We can see through the shades from the inside of the house and the shades have dramatically reduced the bright sun and heat.< /review>

Today Mike called telling us "even though he wasn\'t going with us due to delivery" he still wanted us to come out, measure, write a detailed lone item quote for a new fabric and extensive graphics so he could check the pricing on the company he was going give the work to. The other companies are painting the graphics and we are using fusion vinyl process which is more precise, longer lasting and more expensive. We declined as he already told us he wasn\'t going to use our services.'}<//Response>
<text>I messaged accent awnings about getting an awning made. I sent them photos to give them an idea of what I wanted; pretty simple right. They had let me know it would take roughly  5 weeks and that it might not work with our timing to finish the project. After talking with my business partner we decide to give it a shot and be willing to wait. Called them today. Talked with Tim just a bit ago; so I told him we would be getting three quotes, he said "well we are going to take the longest and probably be the most expensive". I guess they really don't care to help you if you are actually shopping. Not worth the time or money would definitely not recommend.</text></record></dataset><record>

We had such a great experience with Accent Awnings. From the first phone call to set up the appointment, to the extremely knowledgeable estimator, to the extremely professional installation team they earned 5 stars across the board. The product is quality (they manufacture it themselves, which is one of the other reasons we went with them) and even now after 10 months of using the shades we have not had a single issue. Highly recommend them!< /review>

<text>My first time going to this park. I enjoyed the swings made me feel like a kid again.  Very quiet. And everyone who is there keeps to themselves. Will be going back daily they have exercise machines for free use. Saves me from going to a gym<//text>< pictures>

Neighborhood in fair condition and right across from a church.  It use to be a landmark for drugs and homelessness.  They've done a fabulous job cleaning it up.  All you see now are families and children playing.<//Text>

<Review>The sprinklers were on the entire 2 and a half hours I was there. So I couldn't really sit in the grass. Because of that, there is also no shade. Near the tables there is a constant smell of waste... I could care less for the park, but kids seemed to enjoy it<//Review>< name>

On a perfect sunny day this is as good a place as any to be.  PERIOD.

Alamo Square is so picturesque, how do you not get pictures of  the 'Painted Ladies' and downtown Los Angeles - you do!

When visiting Los Angeles, Alamo Square is a must.< /review>

Small, quaint park with the standard prebuilt slide-tower-bridge installation you see everywhere and some bodyweight exercise machines. I like to occasionally chill here to eat a sandwich from the Subway down the block. It's quite peaceful.</Review>

<Review>It's a place for the community. Small and cozy and the kids love it! It has been remodeled for the use of people to stop by and do the routine work out. There are a few exercise equipment pieces to use. All and all it's a nice spot in the middle of the community for everyone to enjoy! 🤣</Review><Time>1533066284042< /Time><Pictures>None</Pictures><userid>117814237041899342382< /userid>< Response>

I love this place I bring my girls here definitely a lot cleaner and safer than it what it used to be. I grew up in this area and I remember the old school play ground type of field with the sand.< /review>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>It's a small neighborhood park dedicated to the community where u could stop for a few to catch a breeze...do a few exercises or read. You could bring the kids for their pleasure of work out along with the dog. Hang out on the grassy area for a small picnic or a quick nap. Whatever's on your agenda that day...enjoy!</text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Suitable for children to play, for others I do not recommend it. The games are very well kept, fabulous and then it's free.

(Original)
Adatto per fare giocare di bambini, per altri utilizzi lo sconsiglio. I giochi sono tenuti molto bene, fiabeschi e poi è gratis.

Delicious place to have a nice meal, everything has a very good authentic taste to it The tacos are awesome and they add a grilled onion that is to die for.Places kind of lonely on the street but as more people find out about this place they will soon be full and for you drivers you could always call and order your meal so you can just get going.</Text>

< Review>
I have never been much of a taco truck fan. Based on some previous experiences that I had, I really did not feel the desire to try out different taco trucks, but la Paloma changed that for me.

This truck stands out on cleanliness, hygiene, prices, and quality.

The truck is clean and has a sink for one to wash their hands. The counter is clean and free of food residue/grease. The people serving make sure that the food is well served and presentable.

Prices are reasonable. $2 per taco. $1 canned soda. $2+ for bottled Mexican drinks. $2 champurrado.

The quality is superb. The meat tastes fresh and the salsa is tasty with the right amount of kick. My personal favorite is Tacos al Pastor--fried marinated pork and my wife's favorite is Tacos de tripa--fried to a delightful crisp. I especially enjoy the use yellow corn tortillas. Yellow corn tortillas enhance the flavor of a taco. Add a little of a crisp to it and the experience is greater.

This will be a taco truck that I will visit if I am craving tacos.</Review>

My Husky ripped his Dew Claw off trying to climb a cyclone fence. I called SVAH and even though they were fully booked, they took my puppers in and fixed him up. Everyone there that I had the pleasure of interacting with was amazing! I was kept informed at all times of any changes that happened. Friendly, a great sense of humor (very important to me), more importantly, very caring with me and my pooch! I'm very grateful to my neighbor for referring them to help. I think I found a new vet!<//Review>

I have all 5 of my fuzzy friends as patients here and the team at Sun Valley alway's goes above and beyond for they're care and accommodation towards some of my dogs own anxieties, based on natural behavior to protect. You will not be disappointed if you decide to bring your own fuzzy friends here.
Thank You Sun Valley!!<//Review>

<review>These people are the absolute best. My dogs aren't big on strangers but they LOVE all the employees here so much. They are thorough and check in after appointments to make sure there were no bad side effects for whatever procedures were done. It's clear they really care about the animals, as well as their humans. They are responsive and making appointments is easy. You typically can make one within the next few days or sometimes the day of if there is an urgent issue they are equipped to handle. They're so great, in fact, that I am actually tearing up right now at the thought I will be moving soon and my dogs will have to meet a new vet.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

We went to Sun Valley Animal Hospital for many years before moving out of the area.  We loved the service, especially from Dr. Garg!  She recently operated on our dog Ivie and did a great job removing fatty tissue lumps from our dog's chest.  She also alerted us to teeth problems that we had been unaware of.

Dr. Garg arranged to be at the office on the day of Ivie's surgery because she knew we very much respected her expertise.  She and the staff were very attentive to our needs, as always.  All of the Doctors at Sun Valley take the time to talk to their clients, to explain everything and to answer every question.  The technicians are also great!

Sun Valley Animal Hospital has also done a good job managing throughout Covid.  We would highly recommend this veterinarian office to everyone in the Concord and Pleasant Hill area!< /Text>

They have taken care of my 2 pups that are now 2 1/2 years old since I got them when they were weaned.  They've taken care of the parents as well.  The employees take the effort to make it as pleasant as possible so the dogs don't mind going in for a visit.  I've had other experiences in the past and this is a big plus!</review>

Friendly attentive staff. Even with covid precautions and having to park outside and call, the staff came right out and started paperwork. They were super busy and ran a little late, but kept checking on me so I knew I wasn't forgotten about, and honestly thats the biggest thing for me. Stuff happens, just keep me in the loop is all I ask for and that seems to be a big ask these days. So, great job Sun Valley. I'm a new customer for them and very happy with my experience so far.< /Review>

<review>No other animal hospital comes close. Sun Valley has the most competent, professional, and pet-loving staff for East Bay area. You and your pet will have a warm-fuzzy feeling after being here. Peace of mind, for you and your pet.<//review>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I took my 14 year old dog in for a cystotomy, and they did an amazing job. Dr. Sharma and Rhiannon went above and beyond for my dog. They said that her bladder stones were so big and difficult to remove, and they almost had to perform an emergency surgery to take them out. Instead, they worked extremely hard and were able to successfully remove them. The staff here is absolutely amazing, because not only did the vet contact us personally and multiple times to make sure she was okay,  but they were able to explain everything so clearly and professionally to us. Right now my dog is healing and is happier than ever. Thank you for taking care of her!<//review>< pics>

The second time I went back was for my dog to get surgery. My older dog underwent surgery to remove a growth and everything from the quote (which was definitely competitive and fair) to the surgery was done professionally and look to be excellent surgical precision.

They let me know during surgery that my dog also needed four tooth extractions which was nice so I wouldn't have to pay for a second time to put him under it to her just remove the teeth. I told them to go ahead and remove them and they only charged me for three of the four teeth.

I will definitely be a returning here and They are definitely my new primary care veterinarian.</text>< Pictures>

They were prompt, friendly and reasonably priced. We were there for just over 30 minutes, start to finish. I had to wait in the car because of covid. The vet did not even recommend expensive options without taking a common sense approach first. Office called the following day to check on the dog, and it felt like genuine concern. I wish I could have had a few more minutes to chat with the vet, but overall it was a great visit and we'll be back.</Review>< Pictures>

I have 4 dogs, 8 cats, and 9 chickens... I've had my fair share of vets. This is the one I keep returning  to.. Currently one of my dogs is a husky who developed a horrible case of MMM and Pemphagus and they have been supportive, thoughtful and helpful through the entire process. I have never had a vet experience as painless. I do need to shout out Dermatology for Animals since I have worked with them in the past and they are great too but have a very specific focus, and Sage Emergency because they have been there in a pinch but SunValley is my go to for everything. As another reviewer said.... they really care here... its not just a job.<//review>

Otherwise, please avoid this place. I never seen before that vet would come out to check what kind of car person drive so she knows how high to bill them. On top of that I brought my 11-12lbs silky terrier for a check up cause he has swollen mouth area, dry skin and losing hair in that area.  Due to COVID owners are not allowed inside. I said okay, but I particularly informed technician that my dog was previously attacked by a dog and even though it happened a month ago he is very timid and scared. I asked to be very careful and gentle with him. Also, I had to ask for vet to inform me if she wants to do any procedures before she does. Well, I get a call after a check up and first thing vet informed that my dog is drooling so he has dental infection so he needs dental cleaning. So first thing first, I particularly asked to be gentle with my boy, obvious she has no inkling on what means to be gentle. My dog was traumatized after the visit two days. She as many other Indian vets don’t have any compassion or liking for your pet, they have liking for your money. I paid $108 for check up and tiny bottle of meds. Also, I asked to get estimate for my dog’s teeth cleaning. So be not surprise she quoted that to clean my dogs teeth would cause $1000 in best case scenario and it will definitely would go up. Estimate actually states that it might be $1500+. I mean it’s 12lbs doggy not a horse.  I definitely scheduled appointment to get another opinion since the skin dryness and hair loss around the area was not addressed and she didn’t even talk about it even then asked.

To addition to my experience I spoke with another lady who picked up her beautiful dog from Thai vet’s care. They kept a dog for a week they never responded to her follow ups and told me all other bad experience she had with this vet. On top of that she received a bill that for sure indicated overcharging.</Review><Time>1604528939270</Time>< Name>

I am not usually the person who takes our animal to this vetinary hospital due to my working hours but I have been here before and we've used them for years.
I have them to be competent and caring. If course just like with your own medical care you need to be an advocate for your dog. Pay close attention to your dog and their symptoms, they can't tell you themselves. Make sure to bring up all your concerns to the vet, I've had a vet catch things they were going to miss simply from describing symptoms that concerned me.
Bottom line I feel comfortable recommending this place for animal medical care.<//review>

Just had major teeth extraction for my Dog "Mr. Mick" who had been suffering for many years. The Good Doctor at Sun Valley immediately evaluated the problem as Serious and scheduled the work asap. Now my Mick is happier than he ever was :) The Very Best Animal care I have seen in my 65yrs ! Thank you! I am a believer and now have the Vet  I've been seeking for a long time.< /Text>

They have always been able to get my Honey in, same day, since she was a new puppy.

Honey’s super shy but she really likes the Dr. here, even though she has figured out that when we come here, it’s typically not fun for her 😂.

On our last visit, the procedure ended up being almost $100 less than what they quoted me.. When does that ever happen at the Vet?!?< /Text>

I took my cat in because she had blood in her urine. They took some urine from her and sent it in to be tested, paid for everything and never got a call back! I called multiple times after, but sadly I never got a call back! I decided then to go to a different place! I had the perfect veterinarian for over 10 years and they were on top! Best one ever but sadly the office is over in Germany!< /Review>

Complete lack of compassion - we have come to the heart wrenching decision to put down our very loved German shepherd for behavioral issues.  After a long 6 year history of behavioral therapists, trainers, several thousand dollars, muzzles, and kennels, we simply cannot keep her safe. She just bit the 5th person and has countless dog attacks too. Most people would say I should have put her to sleep long ago, but I failed, and gave both her and me the benefit of the doubt that we could do better. That I could set more boundaries, restrictions and separation. But she is just too fast and this last incident happened at our home.

When we called the vet, rather than show compassion for this horribly emotional situation, they immediately started doubting our intentions and drilling us with 20 questions.  I fully expected to be asked questions - that is the  responsible thing for a vet to do. What I did not expect was to be charged and indicted.

We have had other problems with the vets at this hospital but now they have lost our business forever. We have two dogs, one we are sadly about to lose, but we will not return to allow them to care for our other pup. There is no caring at this facility anyway.<//review>

I came here since my cat had gotten sick. The vet was kind and friendly. However, on my first visit there, she misdiagnosed my cat. Thus, I had to bring him in for another visit when he was in a much worse condition. (As I am writing this after my second visit, I am hoping that they diagnosed my cat correctly this time) The staff there were very friendly and helpful.</Review>

Basic exam and vaccinations. we were greeted quickly, shown to the exam room and the doctor arrived within minutes of the preliminary weigh-in and other activities. The vet was adept at establishing rapport with my kitty and her exam was quickly concluded. Although we have not had any major issues as yet, thankfully, our visits so far have been great.<//Text>

<review>They are all so nice! Had a great experience and they took really good care of my Bella. She usually is super anxious when going to the vet and in the end she was laying down relaxed. Prices were reasonable too. Would definitely recommend!<//review><gmapID>0x808566b58812cb39:0x941e80f1c353de84< /gmapID><Rate>5<//Rate>< Response>

Dr Lanzot is wonderful. The office staff is undertrained and disorganized. I continued to go to this location because Dr. Yohler and Dr. Thayer used to work there. But since new ownership I'm not going to continue being a client. It was actually not convenient to my home. I just kept going because it was a place that I was familiar with. I am currently looking for a new veterinarian in Concord.< /review>

The best vet around! I wkd for encina e.r vet so do have to say standards are a little high. The dr's and staff are hands down the best! Very thorough, cost effective, go above and beyond. Wellness checks after visit and they TRULY care, not just a job to them. Great people and even my finicky feline doesnt mind 'to much' going to her appt. 10 stars from me! Thank you Sunvalley! You guys are amazing!< /Review>

I was searching for an economical Vet to bring my dogs. I googled “economical vets” in the Bay Area and Sun Valley Animal Hospital popped up. I made an appointment and was VERY pleased with their $25.00 office visit cost! I was also VERY pleased with the professionalism I witnessed by the staff and Vets!  EVERYONE was so kind to me and my dogs. I scheduled the VERY NECESSARY surgery and was pleased with the outcome. Thank You Sun Valley Animal Hospital!< /Review>

The Dr's and women of Sun Valley Animal Hospital really saved us.  We had just put our beloved pup down to cancer and adopted a really abused 4 month old puppy.  We knew this puppo was going to have some issues but she ended up with PARVO on top of everything else.  They are one of the few vets with a Parvo unit!  Who KNEW?? I did not.  But I was overjoyed when I found they could treat our baby.  Everyone here is so supportive and wonderful.  AND THOROUGH... unlike our previous vet.  We are still waiting for our little one to finish her treatment, but we get visits and they call with pupdates so I know she's in the best hands.  Thank you guys so much!</Review>

Friendly, caring people, skilled care and great customer service. I like cats and they seem to like me. Over the past 30 years I've adopted several new friends from my neighborhood with checkups and vaccinations as part of that process; we always ended up at Sun Valley Hospital. I really liked the former owner and after a few years of a break without cats I suddenly found myself with two, then a third cute stray kitten.
.
I was very pleased to find that the new owners are just as nice as the last carrying on a great legacy for this place. Their customer service is first rate with appointment reminders and follow up calls after treatment. They're part of our neighborhood so it's a short trip for my critters who don't like being crated. The staff is wonderful and Dr. Garg is a treasure. My kitties are strays, mixed breeds, indoor/outdoor cats but they are loved.
.
These cats adopted me, they are not "owned" and my philosophy of care is to have them neutered, checked and vaccinated to keep the neighborhood and them safe then let them go on about their business of being cats. They've all been treated with care and respect and without any lectures about what I "should" be doing to maximize they're care or attempts to "oversell" services.
.
I would (and have) recommended this place to friends. This is a great place for anyone wanting quality, caring veterinary care.</text>

<review>They helped us w/a 20+ yr old lady cat that i adopted cuz a neighbor had to go into a care facility. She had to have medicine twice a day for a thyroid issue. We had a good year & a half run w/her but she passed away recently. Turns out her original owner had passed a few months ago. She knew obviously. Anyway S.V.A.H. sent a condolences card that was personally signed w/a msg from 8 (EIGHT!) different caretakers/employees!! That is the sweetest thing ever. I couldn't believe it & it still makes my cry with joy & admiration for a company that cares so much as to do that. Thank you so much S.V.A.H.!! Most considerate veterinarians ever**<//review>< user_name>

<Text>Noticeably understaffed, but decent overall - plan to wait. Only one vet on site; technicians double as receptionists.

Pretty pricey but what vet isn't these days. They at least review your treatment options/costs with you before any implementation of services.

Exam, heartworm test, and two weeks worth of antibiotics = $164.05.

Exam rooms severely lacked any personality (empty walls aside from promotional papers taped up where framed pictures used to be) and were not clean upon entry.

Excellent automated communication system (text/email).</Text>< Pics>

<Review>I have been to many, many vets over the years, and this one is by far, my FAVORITE!  They always give me a friendly greeting. One of the staff helped me get in the door with my kitty, when she saw I was struggling.
I never have to wait long.  The vets are so nice and so is the staff!
Everything I need to know is patiently explained to me, and their prices are fair. They do not try and talk me into unnecessary tests, they always work with me to help find the best solution for my pet at the time.
Love their hours too! Open a bit later than many of the others.  I always leave there happy. I would highly recommend Sun Valley Animal Hospital! 5 Stars!<//Review>< Gmap_id>

First time customer, never know what to expect. We were handled with a smiling staff eager to help with any questions, plus a host of information they gave us. They took the time, because they care and take pride in their jobs, not just because it is their job. I will be taking my dog Horatio there from now on. I would recommend you do the same!<//Text>

I moved up to Concord from the South Bay and needed a vet for four dogs.  I was extremely pleased to have found Sun Valley Regional Animal Hospital. The employees and doctors are very kind and caring about all the animals they see in the clinic. I have had to put one dog down due to brain disease and the technician sat with my dog and I with complete empathy. If I have a question, the doctor calls back and discusses whether I should bring my pet into the office for further treatment. My daughter has taken her cat to see the vet on my recommendation and was also very happy with the clinic. I highly recommend Sun Valley Regional Animal Hospital to everyone who has a pet or pets. It is a great facility.</Text>

It's not perfect but it's the best I've found. They won't rip you off anywhere the extent that Sage will. Dr. Gar is a sweetheart and my animals love her. The staff is likeable. All vets are expensive. Get your meds elsewhere if you can.< /Review>

My family and I have been going to Sun Valley Animal Hospital for close to 30 years, and even though it's changed hands when the previous vet retired,  the new vets and  staff are extremely caring, very patient and very loving to my animals. They go above and beyond who service and the care of they demonstrate with my animals and really make me feel welcome and like they genuinely care about my two dogs and that we are not just another patient. The staff are also very knowledgeable and extremely flexible when it comes to scheduling or reschedule an appointment and they go the extra mile when it comes to the care given. I hope to be a client of theirs for another 30 years. Thank You Sun Valley Animal Hospital!<//review>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>My golden retriever developed lesions covering much of her body.  Dr. Singla was able to determine that my dog was allergic to the pork in her wet and dry food.  Of interest, although labeled as "Chicken and Barley" or "Beef and Chicken", both the wet and dry dog foods contained pork as demonstrated by reading the labels carefully.

The nicest vet I've ever been to. Very clean and you are in and out in a matter of 20 minutes. I love how much the staff loves the animals that come! they are also very good about checking up on the animals after they have had shots or any appointment. Also when you make an appointment they are amazing about reminding you the day before and then texting you the day of about the appointment. I know that If that didn't happen I would have missed atlas one appointment!
Overall I love this vet, and suggest it to any friends needing a new place to take their animals.</review>

I am new to the Concord area and was in great need of a vet for my foster puppy.
The staff and Vet were amazing. They're compassionate and do not rush you through your appointment.
They gave me all the options of care that could be offered and were not pushing for any one option.
They have been great keeping me in the loop as to how the dog is doing.

I will be adopting a dog soon and they will be my choice of vet to take my dog too.
Not only are they in a good location for me to get to but their rates seem to be along the line as all other vets  even a little under.<//Text>

<text>Have been with them for the last 3.5 years. Some great changes have been made in the last few years since it changed ownership. I was happy before and I'm happy now. They are all very organized and on time. My dog gets excited to go in, even though it isn't always so much fun for her! Highly recommend them to care for your pet.</text>< pictures>

Excellent care and medication plan for 14.5 year old Chiweenie.  Able to reduce the dosage of a med with a different combination of prescriptions to treat congestive heart failure.  The doctors really care and are genuine.  Thank you!</text>

I adopted a cat a few months ago and took him to Sun Valley Animal Hospital for a check up. They were professional and very welcoming and friendly. They cut my cat's nails and made sure he was completely up to date on all of his shots. I was given discount on the first appointment and they sent me a coupon for my next visit too!<//Review>

Finding a vet you trust is a good thing. We started bringing our cats here because it was just down the street. We're planning to move to a nearby town soon, but we'll still keep coming here, because once you find a good vet you stick with them. Our kitties are well taken care of here!<//Text>

<Review>My dog had leg amputation at Sun Valley Animal Hospital 3 months ago. I can only say that there are awesome people all around, From front desk to the doctors, everyone was kind and positive, and they treated my dog really well. The surgery was successful, my dog is fine now and I couldn't have survived this without them. Thank you Dr. Singla and I recommended this hospital to any animal owner.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Sun Valley Regional Animal Hospital has been my vet for the past decade, first for my aging dog who required a lot of care for her failing kidneys, and the vets and staff at Sun Valley were excellent with all that. Now I take my 3-year-old German Shepherd there for all her vax, basic care, and whenever there is any other health issue. The practice has changed hands since I began going there, but the new ownership is excellent, with expanded office hours and caring vets and staff, so there has been great continuity of care. Their fees are not the "cheapest" around but neither are they the most expensive, and for me having peace of mind around the care my dog receives is important.</Review>< pictures>

Hi,
We have been going to Sun Valley for a 13 years and we will go no where else. The doctors are kind and helpful and staff customer service the best. They treat you pet like they are our babies and you know they are our babies. The personal touch for whatever the situation is for my babies matter greatly to me.

With Sun Valley it's not about the money, it's about the bedside manner- my babies get.

Please Please bring your babies to the best caring place in northern California.

My beautiful Dog recieved great Service at a great price !  Better then the two other vets I've used.
I was able to get in the same day !  This is important when your dog has a problem.
For the price I will go back.
Thank you Sun Valley Vet !
Keep up the good work.< /review>

I had a great experience here. My cat was very sick on a Saturday morning, and I couldn't get her in to see her regular vet since they were booked. I called Sun Valley and they were able to see her that morning. Dr. Singla and his staff are great, they took very good care of my kitty, and were very compassionate. I am on a tight budget, so they gave me different options to pursue for her treatment, which I appreciated.</Text>

<text>My Pops has a poor old dog who needed care.  Sun Valley helped me out with his skin and chewing on himself, (the dog, not my Pops) and called me later to check on things.  I really appreciate their help and assistance with keeping the costs down.  I will return for his shots, again the dog, not Pops.  He's got Kaiser.
I would recommend Sun Valley for all your pooch needs.</text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Pics>

< Review>
Very friendly staff and doctors. Doctors are very professional. They do a great job of being honest about what services/procedures/tests are necessary and not really necessary, rather than pushing you to do every possible test to get more money out of the visit. They are great about giving you a list of options to address an issue. Have always treated our dog well and their diagnoses/recommendations have always been accurate and useful.

I have been to other vets that seem unnecessarily rough, for lack of a better term, and poke/prod our dog and make it a generally unpleasant experience (i.e. no finesse), and vets that insist you need to do every possible procedure and test to make sure there is nothing wrong even when you only brought them in for shots and a nail trim and they do not have any symptoms. This is why I appreciate Sun Valley, they are great with both the animals and the people.<//Review>

<response>None<//response><Text>Such amazing and caring people. We have another vet that we take our pets to, but that is all the way in Albany. So when our dog had a severe bloody nose, we took him here and they did everything to the best of their ability to help us carry him in, stop the bleeding, and help us carry him back out so we could take him our usual hospital. I couldn't be more thankful for how kind and concerned the staff was even though we were not clients at the time.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><rate>5<//rate>< name>

I was a long term client of Sun Valley Animal Hospital while Dr. Yohler was the owner and loved him and would still be a client of him.  I left Sun Valley Animal Hospital after a number of problems with Dr. Hughes and if she still owned it I would never go back.  Over Memorial weekend one of my dogs had a serious urinary infection with stones.  I had heard that there were new owners and decided to give them a try.  The doctors and staff couldn’t have been nicer.  They were one of the few places opened that weekend and they were able to fit me in twice.  We had an appointment and then when I had to take her back because she wasn’t eating and in a lot of pain they got me in without much waiting.  Most veterinary offices would not do that and they were really swamped that day.  Now that Dr. Hughes is gone I will recommend Sun Valley Animal Hospital doctors and staff again.   You will be able to see a doctor that day, they do care.< /Review>

I've been bringing my cat here for years.  They know all about my cat and she loves them back. My cat is very finicky with who lets her hold her and she's never had a problem with the workers.  When I call them for a refill on my cats food they have it ready for me as soon as I walk in the door and they also know me by name.</Text>

I just moved not too long ago and they are the closest to me so I thought I'd try this place out. The lady that helped me was super nice and friendly. Then another lady comes out from the back that looks like she works with the lady in the front. This lady Is a lot more heavy set and she looked at me and snarled "you don't have a carrying case?" Usually I get mad at rude people or poor customer service, but this... thing scared me. I told her no and she just told me their rules. (I couldn't find my carrying case and the appointment was booked for the very next morning also no one else and their pets were in the lobby)  I waited not too long and got my kitty seen. I paid $25.00 for the Vet to listen to my kitties Heart, 20 bucks to keep my kitty there for a few hours while the medication works and I can go bomb the apartment with flea meds. I come back to pick my kitty up and they don't even give me a courtesy box to take my kitty back with me. Most Vet places I've been to gave me one... EXCEPT this one.  they are also cheaper than other Vet places for first timers... However good customer service goes a long way... I guess you get what you pay for..... I would rather pay a little more for a place that has people who are nicer and actually wants to be there.</review><user_name>May liew<//user_name><GmapID>0x808566b58812cb39:0x941e80f1c353de84<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My "Baby Girl' (cat) fell deathly Ill overnight. The treatment, 2 overnight stays and concern for both of us was great. The cost extremely lower than I thought. I have high recommendations.<//text>

<text>I have been taking my puppy, Sargent Brownie to this vet office since I got her a year and a half ago. No matter which doctor, asstant, or receptionist I have to deal with that person is compassionate, thoughtful, detailed, knowledgeable, personable, and explain each procedure prior to doing anything so that your aware of what your pets needs are and what it's going to cost. I would think they are compatible with other vets in the area as far as costs go. I know that I feel 100% sure that my dogs needs are met with each visit. On one visit I was getting my dog out of the car (she really didn't want to go inside? but what I didn't realize was one of the Assistant's was watching from outside and when the assistant came in from her lunch she knew my dogs name as she came in the door. That made me feel good that without a chart or something she knew who we were and this was only our 2nd or 3rd visit. Anyway I'll be going b there for a long time to come!!</text>< Pictures>

All of my pets love it here, even the cats who hate being taken out of the house lol.
I have had all types of experiences here from just getting a check up to taking in one of my babies that was seriously injured or sick to unfortunately having to bring in my deceased dog after she was hit by a car.
The staff here always try to ensure each of my visits are always handled with the upmost respect, care and love possible. Ensuring that whether I'm there for a check up or to cremate my baby, I always leave happy or at least feeling cared for and loved during a difficult time.
No matter what I am there for, I always leave with all of my questions answered, my concerns acknowledged and taken care of, and any issue going on is resolved or we have an amazing game plan to tackle the issue head on until it's resolved. They will be with you every step of the way, 24/7.
They always follow up within a few days of your visit to be sure all is well and going okay.
I am so glad I found Sun Valley Animal Hospital and I am thankful for all they have done for my pets and I.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808566b58812cb39:0x941e80f1c353de84</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We have been taking our furry animals here for years (Husky, Doberman, Manchester Terrier, & domestic shorthair cat). They saved our husky's life and we're forever grateful. Their prices are reasonable, the hours are fantastic, and they have never suggested we do anything unnecessary to our pets.<//Text>

Never trust the Veterinarians, as they are simply interested in sucking out your money and not your pet's health.
This especially applies to the Staff at Sun Valley Regional Animal Hospital who were willing to endanger my dog's life by subjecting him to a very dangerous and complicated operation after grossly misdiagnosing him, just so that they could get paid. These people should lose their license.

Take your pets to Diablo Pet Hospital.</review>< pics>

Great experience with Sun Valley. Our old vet told us that they could not get our puppy in for his shots for 2-3 weeks. Sun Valley had him in for his shots later that day! They are great with big dogs also. I have yet to see any of the vets or vet techs here shy away from my pitbull. The best part of all is that they give you options rather then guilting you into expensive tests or treatments. They are great with both of my dogs and I wouldn't go anywhere else.<//text>

<Review>Don't go here , brought a dog I rescued to get shots and a flea bath. The dog has since been adopted.  They turned me into the County stating I had a pit mix and now the county wants some fees .  The dog is a 12 lb Weiner dog mut. If they think this is a pitbull they might think your cat is a lion.    Don't trust them. Good deeds never go in punished.</Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>We rescued a main coon cat from Naknek Alaska. We knew he could not survive the treacherous harsh winter in the tundra ducking bears and god knows what. We brought him to Sun Valley Hospital in Pleasant Hill. He was a big ball of matted fur with a beautiful temperament. We thought it was a 2 year old female, it turned out to be a "He" 8 to 10 years old. Sun Valley Hospital took care of all his needs and shaved his matted coat. We names him Tundra and will be forever grateful to the wonderful staff of Sun Valley Hospital for taking such great care of Tundra. He is a very healthy lovable main coon today.

Just the usual wood, carrots,  etc. But immediately he felt better. Went back to vet she checked his anal glands all well. Now the bill $25.00 for two visits. No bs about 5 or 6 tests.  I'd give them 5 star but I think we all should keep reaching for the next star. Also they have evening appts.< /text>< Rate>

<name>isopod cellphone<//name><text>My kitten had been peeing all over the house which he would not normally do. So my mom and I took him here because we thought he had a uranary tract infection. $500 later our vet thought he just had ear mites as we were awaiting the call with the test results he got sicker and sicker. A couple weeks later I had to go on a trip to New York. When I got back I found out that my dad had taken him to a different vet and he got results for a test in 3 minutes. Turns out he did I have a uti but it had turned into a urinary tract blockage it would have cost 3000 to attempt to save him but we couldn't afford it and there was no garuntee that he would make it. So he was put down because he was in so much pain.<//text>< rating>

<Text>I brought my cat in twice (13 days apart) for his third eyelids not receding and general fatigue. I brought him in, told the vet I thought he had an infection, possibly an upper respiratory infection. I asked for Erythromycin. The vet told me he doesn't have an infection, and those aren't his third eyelids, they're his uvea (Spolier Alert: they were his third eyelids). After a number of treatments and two visits- totaling $460 (and that was after refusing some of their useless recommendations, or it would've been closer to $600). My poor little guy was only getting worse. I spoke with the vet again on the phone, and revisited the idea that it was an upper respiratory infection and he might just need Erythromycin. She said it wasn't and he had to go to a very expensive eye specialist. I simply took him to another vet, who believed me when I said it was an upper respiratory infection, confirmed it was his third eyelids (NOT his uvea) that weren't receding, and she prescribed Erythromycin. He is now all better. The second vet cost $190. The original $460 I spent at Sun Valley, plus the time and aguish my cat and I spent, was a waste. I had to repeatedly hound the staff to get anything in writing. They don't like to give diagnoses or treatments in writing. How am I supposed to keep medical records for my cat? For something as simple as an upper respiratory infection, that I diagnosed FOR them, they managed to swindle me for $460 and leave my cat sicker than ever. I called the vet to see if this can be made right, and she offered to refund me $35. It's better than nothing, but I just wish we could've established more mutual trust so I'd feel comfortable bringing my cat back there. The whole experience was a real bummer. :(<//Text>< Pictures>

My Dolly became suddenly very ill and when i called her regular vet, they said we can see your dog in 2 weeks I was DISGUSTED at the fact they said we can see your DOG in 2 weeks!!! I called Sun Valley Animal Hospital and they said bring her  right now and It turned out my Dolly had a fever of 104 and they gave her I.V. fluids and gave her a check up, it ended up being that dolly ate her mr. squeekies ear and after an hour she threw it up. The staff at Sun Valley were supportive and assisted my Furrbaby and I now only take her to sunvalley for her Regular check-up's. Thank you For being the Best and helping my Baby, I highly recommend them great service, care and support!!!<//text>

<Text>This place has pastries.

Tried both the pumpkin and red bean with mochi pastries. The pumpkin was fresh made, not canned and not like pumpkin pie but like kombucha--a light sweetness.

The red bean with mochi filling was very sweet, in a good way, with a wonderful, glutinous mouthfeel.

Also came for their thick and thin green onion pancakes. Both are good--the thin ones are more about the crispy texture, the thick ones are more about the green onions flavor.

The show stoppers were the pork belly bun and their green leek pastry which was a giant empanada stuffed with green onions, vermicelli, egg, and ground meat. Yum!<//Text>< name>

A home style dishes restaurant with a Taiwanese flavor in their cooking. And on Saturday they have a special breakfast menu that features soy milk, both sweet and salty versions, green onion pancakes, egg biscuits, beef biscuits, xiaolungbao, among others. The only place in Torrance with this offering.</text>

Peter's Place is a traditional Taiwanese restaurant which offers a variety of dishes. The prices are reasonable and the portions are quite generous, too. It is perhaps one of the most authentic Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants in the South Bay area, that is why it is a rarity.< /text>

I loved the flavors of all the dishes. Their soup dumplings are amazing. The pan fried dumplings come with a sweet and spicy sauce that's a good balance. They had the most flavorful house iced tea (Jasmine). I wasn't crazy about their sticky rice texture but I loved the flavors in the dish.</Review>

Very complicated specials menu, where you don't get the bonus boba tea unless you pay cash. And you have to buy at least $20 to pay by card. It's all too much of a pain but the food is good and it's easy to park.</Review>

I love eating at Pete's place. The food is great and the service is exceptional. I have been there many times since I found them and have never, ever had a bad experience. One thing to note, they are closed for a couple of hours after lunch, best check before going.</text>

I took the kids for Saturday breakfast.  We used to get soy milk, egg pancake, rice roll in OC from 99 Ranch and this seems to be the only place to get soy milk for breakfast.

We were disappointed in the experience.  The soy milk tasted diluted, both the hot and cold one.  My 5 year old's comment is 'this tastes like water'.

The fried dough inside the rice roll was pretty tough instead of crunchy.  The egg pancake was good, the texture is more doughy than normal.

We came here for dinner awhile back, similar luke warm impression on food.  The restaurant is very cluttered, and as expected of old restaurant, you wondee about cleaniness.

The servers are nice, but when there are more than 3 tables, they seem to get overwhelm and get anxious at each other.< /Review>

<text>Veronica was very kind and and quick with getting a room same day! In the age of robot answering machines, call centers and safety lectures this was a very pleasant surprise. If you're on the road, they'll make it easy on you.<//text>< pictures>

Well, where do i begin.. the one thing that was done right was being told there was No HOT WATER, before check in. Not sure why there was no hot water... the chain lock was broken and you could not use this device for safety. Third, mold all in the shower and along the bath tub. Fourth, spider webs in the corner as well as some unknown dark sunstance on the curtains. Lastly, a cockroach. Sooo gross. I will not stay here nor recommend this location or any location done by this company.<//text>

<review>My room was pretty clean and bed wasn’t bad. Although this place is somewhat of a dive, management has been cleaning it up from my last stay over a year ago. If you are tired and need to crash, this will work for under $70.< /review></record>

One place ill never stay again.  Unfortunately i prebooked and was unable to walk away from it.  Restroom was dirty with dirt/dust stuck around toilet.  Shower not the best and carpet not vacummed properly.  Definitely a place I DO NOT RECOMMEND. Not to mention the dirty walls decorated with cobwebs. I included pictures for you to see and its interested that the fotos i took and posted are not being showed</review>

<Text>I was tired after driving 8.5 hours... there are lots of fast food restaurants and nestled about a half a mile from the freeway is this Travelodge by Wyndham. I registered at the front desk and got room 114. I put my stuff into the room and what looking for a salad. Again there were plenty of places to find food. I went back into 8 + relax before sleep. I put the air conditioner on and left the front door open to air it out and to eat. After I finished up I noticed the place lightly smelled of stale laundry... I try to carry a spray can of Lysol with me when I'm on the road like this. I sprayed everything including the pillows and anything else I would touch. I'd rather smell a Lysol.  I had better stop here! My advice, don't father staying at this Travelodge by Wyndham... If Mr or Mrs Wyndham is interested in some advice...sell that place and from now on you should keep a little better eye on your money. btw, I was generous in giving you one star.</Text><Rate>1</Rate><GmapID>0x809367352e401b7f:0x8f2081c3b28b3ad9< /GmapID><Time>1570496944991<//Time></record>

<Review>Horrible place to stay. There was Carpet Fresh type room freshener in piles behind the TV stand, on the edge of the carpet next to the bathroom, between the wall and the bed next to the window and air-conditioning unit. It was awful ☹️! Like the floor hadn't been vacuumed in a week. Made me wonder how long the sheets had been on the bed. If we hadn't been desperate for a few hours sleep, we'd have left. Never stay at this place again. Nasty!!<//Review>< pictures>

You now this was the other face of the coin in the Travelodge chain, this facility since the beginning of my reservation they told me the didn't had rooms handycap accessible with two beds only accessible for wheelchair, that was spacious clean, the people very nice and helpful and the price super accessible (of course if you are member of the Travelodge or AAA). This is the half point I had going to San Francisco was good experience and the next time I visit and drive again I'll stop here. Thank you Travelodge Coalinga for having good amenities, and selling me a room  that cover my necessities.<//Review>

<text>Worse Roach infestation in a Hotel I ever experienced.  I had to clean and check everything before I packed up my car and left. Seriously it's pretty bad. I know it's cheap but it's not worth it. And the mattress sucked. I went to 3 different rooms to find one that didn't have a mattress sping sticking my side. Check out the dead roach in the picture.  I got videos of this nasty stuff. Its like a motel 6 on crystal meth.</text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Nice stay at the Coalinga Travelodge. Air conditioning worked great. Two double beds in our room that were pretty comfortable. If you like to swim they have a nice outdoor swimming pool. Located just off Interstate 5 and in proximity of several restaurants and service stations.< /Text>

Only rooms left in town and we had to stop. DO NOT Stay here! Ice maker didn’t work. Place is old, and extremely dirty. We wouldn’t even use the shower. No pride of ownership. Loud guests, groups of men standing around outside drinking late into the night. A total YUCK! Wyndham should be ashamed that their name is on this.<//review>

We've stayed here twice this year and both times were very happy. The rooms are nice, walls are very thin but for one night I don't care. Fridge, microwave and coffee pot are all provided in room as well as shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion on the bathroom. The lady that I've had help me both times is so sweet and the breakfast has lots of options. Will definitely stay here again if we ever drive through.</Review>

Mostly clean. Not new. Bath vent needed cleaning, and shower needed hard water deposit removed. Not my favorite, but doable for a night on the road.< /Text>

The bed was very comfortable room had all the amenities you could ask for, WIFI, a fridge, microwave, coffee pot, hair dryer, cable TV and safe. The shower was nice but did have some black mold in the bottom. That's really my only complaint, they even let us pay cash and didn't even need a card on file! They also accommodated parking for out cargo trailer.</Review>

I was on a long trip (for me) and was quite spent with the evening traffic so swung by this moyel. Price very affordable, coffee and tea and hot chocolate available at all times, free light breakfast in AM. Shower water temperature fluctuated from HOT HOT HOT, to mildly warm and back to HOT. About 5x. Occupancy rate was very low so I doubt multiple showers were used simultaneously. Next to gas station and fast food, as well as I-5 on ramps!!<//Text>

It was clean and quiet.  Bed was comfortable. High in carbs in breakfast situation. Lots of flies and horrible stench in air outside! Very friendly staff.</Review>

< Review>
Cristina Carranza from the front counter was a B, I requested a fridge because I had food with me and she told me she could ask her manager when she got here at 6 am the following morning, and they couldn't hold my food in their fridge. Therefore almost 100 dlls worth of food went to waste. She kept answering my questions very rudely and disrespectful. The room still had the "reviews" from the previous guests, the bathroom full of mold, the vent was very dusty (I have allergies). The AC was extremely loud and kept me up all night because I kept getting hot. The TV is really old and the signal is awful. Beds are uncomfortable and made my back hurt.
Overall a very AWFUL experience, I wouldn't even wish something like this to happento my worst enemy.< /Review>

This is without a doubt the most disgusting and horrible lodging experience I’ve ever had and for a ridiculous price. The check-in process was ridiculous and the room is so gross I slept in the chair to avoid the bed. The sheets are dirty and stained and bed filled with debris. The furniture is covered in dust and grime and floors are stained. The room has the distinct smell of smoke despite being billed as nonsmoking and worst of all the bathroom is covered in dirt, dust, and grime, and appeared not to have been cleaned recently, let alone after the last guest had left. I’m horrified.<//Review>< Date>

< review>
This place is an absolute DIVE motel! There was a ring of urine all around the toilet seat when I removed the little piece of paper around it that said "Sanitized". The shower would go back and forth from normal temp to scalding hot. The TV was an old tube style TV that you could barely see the picture on. It's hard to believe that Wyndham puts their name to this place.
Drive a little further down the road and you'll find much nicer places to stay. Remember, you'll get what you pay for...</review>

<Review>Just off the I-5 in Coalinga, CA.  Friendly night receptionist, very affordable 2 bedroom room upstairs.  The room was very clean, well stocked with hygenic products and also gad the standard T.V. and phone.  The Travelodge was respectfully quiet and far enough away from the highway to keep out the noise of cars.</Review>< pictures>

The staff is really nice and its a ok place if u have to stay for a night but if u go as often as i do u start to expect a lil more especially if they raise the prices. Its outdated, you dny always get tge cable channels they offer, sometimes the coffee maker in thr room dosent work. But the biggest problem is the broken water heater that means i hvae ti stand in the corner of my shower and hope i dnt get scalding hot water or freezing water. Finding tge right time to rinse off before i get. Scalded. So if u have kids check the water. That water heater has been broken for over a year now. Hopefully them raising the prices will help them fix up the motel.<//Text>

The room was so small my bum was literally on the air conditioner when I was in bed and it smelled terrible (the room not my bum...).  At least there were not bugs or bandages.  If I had to stay there again I would because it was safe and clean enough but if I had any other option I would choose the other.</text>

<text>Okay accommodation, but location is awful. This is not necessarily their fault but due to the cattle ranch just across the highway!  When you drive on highway 5 through central California and see that ugly brown haze up ahead, and then you start to smell cattle while still miles away. You see people frantically rolling up windows, futilely adjusting air vents, and pulling over to raise convertible tops, a little farther is this place. Visit your local army surplus and pick up a gas mask first.</text>< Pics>

This may not be the best smelling hotel but they do a really good job. The rooms are mostly ok and the staff is nice. I was even able to plug in a refridgerator. The plumbing did not flush when we entered it and they were very kind to offer us two other rooms but I just fixed it myself. Reat little hotel.< /text>

If i could give zero stars i would!!! We stopped here late at night driving for a long time and couldnt drive anymore! Now i dont mind so much old or outdated but this place was filthy and if i hadnt been exhausted we would have demanded a refund and left! The carpet had a spot that looked like gum stuck and squished into carpet the room was so incredibly small you could barely move at one point it looked like it was a single room they shoved 2 beds in! The bathroom was gross loose dirt on tile floor had not been swept in a while shower stall had dirt splatters on the wall, shower Curtin was visibly soiled, base of toilet had dirt had not been wiped or cleaned in quite some time looked like they wiped the seat in bathroom wiped out sink and left there was a layer of dust on the tv and food crumbs on the desk! Would NEVER ever stay here again nor any other travel lodge after this experience!</Text>

<review>Excellent price, professional / accommodating staff, clean office,  solid room, desk, good shower, quiet, considerately / well cleaned.

Internet didn't seem to work / was spotty although they had 9 wifi connections that popped up (may have been my fault), but that was not on my list of needs for the night. I will be here again, I can foresee it.</review><Response>None</Response>< username>

< review>
After traveling 13 hours from Oregon to Southern California and having 4 more hours of driving to do, my boyfriend and I decided that we should stop and get a room for the night. I saw a sign that said they had rooms for $42.00 so we pulled in walked into the office we were told oh no sorry we don't have any more of those rooms left. So we took another room, after inspecting the room we noticed that the bedspread had not washed and had seamen stains, my boyfriend walked up and asked for new blankets,he was told they didn't have any extra blankets but offered to move us. We moved into the new room that had 2 beds, again both beds were disgusting and the wall was covered in boogers. That was the last straw. We went back into the office and asked for our money back and the girl at the counter didn't even ask us what was wrong. I will never stay at a travelogde again. It was obvious that they do not care about standards. Tweezers everywhere, it was obvious that they don't drug test. They should be shut down!</review>

Terrible. It was absolutely the worst experience I've had at a hotel. The rooms were small and the bed I slept on with my infant daughter was INFESTED with bed bugs. Unfortunately for me, I didn't find out until the morning after when I was covered with bites. I still have scars from those bites. Thankfully, my daughter was ok. My husband, sleeping on another bed, had some bites too. DO NOT STAY THERE!!! I would give this zero stars if I could.</review>

<Review>Very dirty! My room smelled like urine. The trashcans were overflowing with trash. I stopped for a few hours to rest from my road trip. I didn't notice the urine smell til the morning because wehen I checked in at 2am, the air conditioning was on and they had sprayed with air freshener. The area smelled really bad too.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Aside from being very dirty and not well kept, we did end up having an ok sleep. The staff made us feel as if out belongings would get stolen and that made us feel uneasy.</Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>For the price I can't demand for more. First of all the room is clean which for me is the most important though it could be improved with a good smelling deodorizer since the smell is of the cleaning thing. Next and most important are he carpet , the bathroom are clean, the linens are really fresh and in spite of the cheap rate you are supplied with shampoo, conditioner, lotion, coffee which motel 6 don't have. In Solvang when we checked in at motel 6 we have to run to 24 hr Walmart just to buy shampoo and conditioner because they don't supply.
The only thing for me that they should improve is their office. They need to make it smell good and dress up a little, because it's a turn off, I did not expect their rooms to be clean when we entered the office that's why I did not want to check in at fiirst but all the hotel's around were fully booked.</text>< Response>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Definitely in the top 10 on my list of worst places to stay. The whole place was booked, except it had 2 rooms left, both of which are pet rooms, having driven 12 hours with 3 screaming mini-me's, I took one. First I get harrased (whistles and whatnot) by some construction workers on my way to the room, then the air doesn't blow cool air and it was stuffy and hot. But we dealt with it by waking up in pools of sweat throughout the night. The construction workers that haf the place booked must have not had working air either because they all had their doors and windows open, which caused it to be loud until well after midnight, then, about 4:30am the workers decided it was time to get up and shout across the courtyard to each other, not that we were asleep anyways because of how hot it was (in april)...  and now the topping on the cake: we all woke up with little red bites all over us. I'm assuming from fleas....  so if you value your sleep, DO NOT STAY HERE!<//review>< gmapID>

This Place is not very clean … the staff was nice, but the place is dirty, the showers had MILDEW,
the corner of the room had about 10 black dead crickets  all piled in the cover, then theres  mosquitos flying around in our room … and its so  NOISY ,  it was 7 am and someone was laughing and shouting for like 30 mins nonstop i couldn't get any sleep at all , so if your gonna stay here put cotton in your ears or bring ear plugs for the noise and so the bugs don't get in your ears.< /Text>

This is a fantastic bakery with a fantastic staff! Their prices were reasonable and their pastries were delicious!! I went there during Covid pandemic and they were not super busy at the time, but took the time to explain everything about each pastry to me.<//review>

I bought birthday cake it was too dry and old. Not good quality at all. When I took the cake back to him .. he tried a little bit and said , it's fresh to me.
No customer service , No quality.< /Text>

<Text>The flower is not edible ): Anyway my impressions when I saw the ice cream was that it would be like Ube. However, the ice cream is not like Ube and instead like a sweet yam flavor. So if you are into yams and purple, then the ice cream will be a pleasant surprise. The texture of the ice cream wasn't too thick either. Combined with the texture, the yam flavor wasn't too bold so if you're not a fan then that helps too. The location of the cafe has lots to do around with a market on the first floor and then a bunch of shops/restaurants as you go up. Right outside the restaurant they also have a fake grass patch and benches where you could sit which is pretty nice.<//Text><userid>114442485361882552865< /userid><rating>3<//rating><Response>None<//Response></record>

Used to be a good bakery but they have horrible customer service and the quality of the pastry had gone significantly south. I will absolutely not spend another  dime at this establishment.<//Review>

Honestly I have no idea how I found Tarzana Bakery but its well worth the search! Like others have said, its a bit tricky to find. However you'll be rewarded with sweet treats in a super cute cafe. Very instagramable.
When I came here I felt obligated to get sweet potato as it looks like their specialty. I ended up with the sweet potato tiramisu. The rich purple color is gorgeous! And it tastes absolutely delicious. Its soft and fluffy like eating a cloud. The sweetness is also more subtle which I like in desserts. My friends got the strawberry tiramisu. I personally enjoyed sweet potato more. We also did the milk bingsoo which had an ample amount of milk flavor. Overall a great place to grab sweet treats! Its in a nice hidden complex too with some green space outside so you can enjoy the sunshine and walk around when youre .<//Text>

I was very skeptical of this place for years and I finally went and I will definitely be going back there again. Recommend to anyone wanting to shop. Be ready for a minimum of 3 hours of shopping or walking around.</Review>

If your wondering what Tijuana feels and smells like come on down. A wonderland for addicts. The shopping is good if your into merchandising or looking for a good deal on certain goods. Good luck if you dare go there. Vaya con Dios< /text>

Such a beautiful, colorful, and cultured area. I enjoyed my stroll and shopping through the Callejones. It was very crowded even on a week day mostly everyone wore their masks. Except some chola tough girl who probably wanted confrontation. Asides from that I wouldn't mind coming back here a couple times a year. You can find so many different things. I bought a loteria pictured backpack that became my favorite thing. Parking isn't too bad but the restrooms are dirty despite them charging you to use them.. but if you're desperate because you've been drinking so much agua fresca then you won't care.</review>

<text>cheaper than others! Availability of different kinds of products and gifts that the visitor may additionally need at lower charges than other purchasing regions, and of the top characteristics. We got here right here remaining week because we bought presents for our family in our town. They were so glad in fitting their attire, denims, and shirts. thanks so much!< /text><user_id>116400881609910225880<//user_id></record>

The Parking Lots are a rip-off. The signs say $3 parking and the even tell you at the entrance that it's super cheap and when you get in it's already $15 or $20. We looked for a different place and it was the same thing, every parking we went to was the same, they all said $3 at the entrance, but inside we paid $15. When we finished and back to the car a different car was getting charged $20; meaning they charging different price to different cars.
I wish this had a ZERO stars option.< /Text>

<review>Cheaper than others! Availability of different types of merchandise and gifts that the traveler may need at lower prices than other shopping areas, and of the top qualities. We came here last week because we bought gifts for our relatives in our town. They were so happy in fitting their dresses, jeans, and shirts. Thank you so much!<//review>< time>

<Review>Adjacent to the better shopping mall in the area. But this is still the best option for shopping. A haven for all that you want for parties and any occasions. They're selling affordable cocktail dresses and pretty bags at a very reasonable rate. Just try to visit the place.<//Review><Resp>None</Resp><userid>115579455630773942640< /userid><rating>5</rating><Date>1606403463316<//Date>< user_name>

<Text>My favorite place to visit when I go to LA. The fruit is amazing which is one of the reasons I go. And they also have lots of great deals. They also have this amazing flower shop area that I fell in love with. Really awesome but weekends it is always packed.<//Text>< user_id>

A melting pot of many cultures, the alleys will provide almost any piece of clothing, home goods, and general merchandise you could think of. Parking is not free but very affordable. It's always good to walk around and hunt for the best bargains, while you also get the chance to try many Latin American and Asian typical dishes.<//Text>

The store was decent although the clothing district has a little of everything to fit everyone's needs plus at a cheap price. Some areas aren't so clean and smell of urine. And trying to find a restroom is a nightmare and if you do,  they expect you to buy something for a certain amount before handing you the key.< /review>

I love going to the callejones. You always find great deals on clothes (t-shirts, socks, calzones, etc) and other items and the fact that the clothes are cheap in price doesn't mean that they are cheaply made; remember that we have a big manufacturing district and also a textile district so that's where many of the clothes come from, also from China but let's be real what doesn't come from China nowadays? And I think that the quality has gotten better.
It's conveniently located, not that far from the 10 and there's public transportation in case you don't want to deal with parking but if you have to I would recommend looking for a place to park between Los Angeles Street and Hill Street. There's places where you can park for 5-8 dlls right in the middle of everything but I don't like it because there's always so many people walking and the streets are kind of narrow so I rather walk for a little bit to avoid that headache and it's not that bad because there's soo much to see and in case you give in to the food they sell around there at least you'll be getting a bit of exercise with the walk.</text>

Loved it!  Imagine 6 square blocks of markets that have alleyway after alleyway of markets and EVERYBODY is ready to make a deal!  Probably the best place to buy your loved ones souvenirs on a 50%  discount over the usual tourist spots.  I your a couple be prepared to spend $$$ and at least 4 hours of time.  PLUS, be sure to spot at a taco truck and get a quick snack... I promise you you are going to need to protein because its a lot of walking.</text>

Plenty of shops with cheap goods of good quality. Most everything is sold wholesale, not retail, and prices are not really set so you can haggle for slightly better prices at many of the shops. If you find something you like at one shop but don't like the service you get, it's very likely you can find the exact same thing down the alley, so don't stress too much.</text>

As far a prices go, this place has great prices, however expect to see a decline in quality.

Selection is very wide and you can find just about anything when it comes to fashion but just like any other place, you have to make sure the product is worth what you are paying for.

Merchants prefer cash and are willing to cut the price down is you pay cash. Place is a bit dirty but if you are OK with it then you are in business.

Clientele is about 90% Hispanics which means Spanish is heavily spoken here. All business speak English so no worries....

Parking maybe a pain in the neck if you arrive after 11am on weekends.<//review>

There's so many different types of foods from tacos to sandwiches and bacon wrapped hotdogs.
We parked at one of the lots, I think it was 8 dollars for the day and started walking up and down the different streets. You can find almost anything you need out there. We went just to walk around and explore a little and ended up walking four and a half miles.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2c7cdf20c254d:0x1fe40f85f7e2e665<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I bought a drone for a fraction of the cost than if I would have bought it at a store. Just about everything there is priced very low, but don't expect to find products that last very long because they are usually knock off.<//review>< Pics>

Nice place to shop, I think it needs cleaner restrooms, cleaner alleys and overall cleaner streets, whoever is charging rent here should pay attention to how bad the street is starting to look, maybe an update would fall really good here overall great experience!!</text>

<review>Love this place. It reminds me of my city, Lima, Peru. It's definitely not for everyone, but if you like and appreciate the hustle and grinding of daily life, you'd like this place. Great for inexpensive shopping and to practice your bargaining skills - bring cash! You'll negotiate better with it - lots of LA and California souvenirs, and random items at cheap prices. It's in the heart of the fashion district so you can do lots of walking here. Bring comfy clothes. Arrive early and read the small writing in the parking lots. It gets crowded in the main alley (Santee st.)< /review>< pictures>

Pretty cool experience, definitely a culture shock to someone new like myself, but I enjoyed my time. A few things to remember when visiting, parking will cost you on average 10 dollars which isn't too bad. If you want to use the bathroom, that's going to cost you as well.</Review>

<review>If you don't mind the crowds and noisy atmosphere and your looking for clothing that not everyone is wearing because they bought it at the mall were everyone shops, then you need to shop here.  Also know as part of the garment district of downtown L.A.  I do want you it's not the mall.   P.s.  shop Los Angeles street also if there.< /review>< Pics>

I love the callejones. Great clothing, you can find anything and everything here. The only down fall, it gets too crowded.< /Text>

Find everything you're looking for for less.  Clothes,  lingerie,  purses,  hair,  colored contacts,  knock off levis, toys,  shoes...you name it.
Just don't buy the fake-up. It's not real Mac and it's made of poop! Use a filter instead.</Review>

You can find good clothes for the low here. Venture out and follow the streets to find indoor shopping marts. Even better deals in there. AND DONT BE A PUSH OVER! Bargain with these people!!! Most people love to bargain prices if you negotiate with them! And if they wont bargain prices with you you'll be fine lol. You'll find it elsewhere or maybe it's a sign to save money 😂 nonetheless, I like going here when I have extra time and cash<//text>

Too many people and too many scam artist you have to be on your toes here.or they will pull a fast one on you...you get okay deals but you can get most of these elsewhere and without the crowds and the hustle and bustle..if you do go their just make sure you hold on to your wallets and purses it's easy for someone to bump into you and score with your wallet or purse..im just warning you.< /review>

Hate the crowds, plus everything is expensive. It's not what it once was. A lot of fake stuff so buyer beware.

It used to be cheap here, like 15+ years ago, not any more.  You can actually get things for the same price at the Mall.  Saturdays and sundays are the busiest. So if you hate crowds, like me, don't even como here.

Every Mac makeup product you see there for sale is FAKE.  I don't think getting an infection is worth the few bucks you save.< /review>

Omg the best shopping experience for the price ever! Totally worth it for me to purchase a plane ticket to fly back to California so I can shop here to purchase my seaasonal wardrobes. Absolutely everything you need can be found at one of the shops in this area. I wear a size 0 and was elated to find smaller womens sizes finally - I have not had much luck even in large department stores. That is not easy for a middle aged 43 yr old woman to find in most stores anywhere else. Absolutely have been telling everyone I know about the place.< /Text>

Cheap materials and all the stores are the same. Don't buy here. Spend $10 more and get the original which will actually last and/or work well.</text>

(Translated by Google) You will always find good deals, from perfumes, clothing, shoes & jewelry. I always recommend bringing bills of 10 and 20 dlls to make the purchase process more agile. It is a safe place at the crime level so there is no need to fear

<review>(Translated by Google) It is very good for walking and shopping, there are only 2 things that are not very good. Those of the parking lots are exaggerated with the prices, it does not matter that you park for an hour they charge you a lot, and there are no bathrooms in the area and the few that there are are in very bad condition.

(Original)
Esta muy bien para caminar y hacer compras, solo hay 2 cosas que no son muy buenas. Los de los estacionamientos son exagerados con los precios, no importa q te estaciones por una hora te cobran mucho, y no hay baños en el area y los pocos q hay estan en muy mal estado.< /review>< rate>

(Translated by Google) You find everything from Monday to Saturday most stores are open, on Sunday almost wholesale stores close, parking is very scarce, there are places that do not charge for parking but you have to walk, in the center there is parking but you pay with coins or credit cards on Sundays is free. The food is very tasty

(Original)
Encuentras de todo lunes a sábado la mayoría de tiendas estan abiertas, el domingo  casi cierran las tiendas que venden por mayoreo, estacionamiento  es muy escaso, hay lugares que no cobran para parking pero hay que caminar, en el centro hay parking  pero pagas con monedas o tarjetas  de crédito los domingos es gratis.

<text>(Translated by Google) A very dirty place! the people were uncountable, if you neglect a little you can easily lose yourself, the smell between the alleys is horrible, you do not feel like eating at any food stall. Even though they sell electronic clothing or anything you are looking for, the dirt and mess is much greater. Not recommended at all. EYE if you need to use a bathroom, it is preferable to go before or after, because those who are there are very dirty. It does not hurt to say that the articles are clearly piracy.

(Original)
Un lugar muy sucio! la gente era incontable, si te descuidas un poco puedes perderte fácilmente, el olor que hay entre los callejones es horrible, no dan ganas de comer en ningún puesto de comida. A pesar de que venden ropa electrónicos o cualquier cosa que buscas, la suciedad y el desorden es mucho mayor. Para nada recomendado. OJO si necesitan usar algún baño, es preferible ir antes o después pues los que están allí son muy sucios. No esta de demás decir que los artículos es claramente piratería.</text></record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The same as always, excellent place to buy piracy, already filled with Central Americans selling food on the sidewalk, eye to the authorities in the parking lot they announce a price and when they pay you they get a higher one, this is called fraud.

(Translated by Google) Great place to buy anything for a great price. Most are fake and most are the real deal. Great place to walk, buy anything you want, and eat great food from street vendors.

A place where you can buy many things like clothes, shoes, breeches, socks. Street food is the best.

(Translated by Google) Great place you find everything, it seems like a small Mexico. Just be careful because there are a lot of people but a good place to go and if they don't speak English it doesn't matter most of them attend in both languages.

(Original)
Genial lugar encuentras de todo, parece un México chiquito. Sólo tener cuidado porque hay mucha gente pero un buen lugar para ir y sino hablan inglés no importa la mayoría atiende en ambos idiomas.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I give it two stars because it is only good to go for a walk and get distracted, everything has become expensive here it is a lie that things are cheaper maybe more expensive than in a normal store if you want there is cheap I prefer to go to the walls fail

(Original)

(Translated by Google) A very dirty place that is very reminiscent of Mexico City. Although if you want to find clothes with Disney characters or basic clothes for every day and cheap this is the place.
