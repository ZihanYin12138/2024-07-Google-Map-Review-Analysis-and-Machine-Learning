Checked in online. Pretty easy. Wait time a little longer than estimate given but not too bad. Stylist was wrapping up previous client.

Steve, my stylist, was very concerned about my preferences. Asked multiple questions, cut when understood what I wanted. Pleasant conversation throughout. Did not feel rushed.

Prices are reasonable.

Shop has good COVID policy in place, in use.

Great visit.< /review>

<text>Took my son here to get a hair cut. The lady who cut his hair was okay. We showed her a picture of what we wanted (which she said she could do no problem) and she did cut his his hair nothing like the picture. His hair came out ok but it wasn't what we had asked for. She also cut his neck and behind his ear and didn't say anything about it. We noticed it when we were dusting him off before getting in the car. The sports side of this barber shop is nice, they really made it feel like the place to be to watch sports! Other than that I wont be returning.< /text>< Response>

Jafet is my go to hair stylist. Super personable, nice, honest, and most importantly great at what he does.  I don’t usually leave reviews for anything, but people should know, that he is indeed excellent.< /Text>

First time visiting. The theme and memorabilia made it a fun place to visit. Check in and payment are somewhat automated. The staff was great and handled my simple trim promptly. She offered other services but wasn't pushy. And I really enjoyed the friendly banter!</Text>

If I could give less than one star I would. Cut looked ok in the chair, but when I got home noticed the back line was all jacked up, hair was all different lengths on top, etc. Took my girlfriend almost an hour to fix it into something presentable at home after.< /review>

I've gotten my hair cut here several times already, each time by a different stylist and all have done a great job. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, while the facility is clean, modern and comfortable. Can't beat the price of $25 for a cut, wash, hot towel and massage. Will continue to go.</Text>

This was not a good haircut. I basically asked for a short back and sides and tidy on top. The sides and edges are wild. The fringe is crooked, and the blending is non-existent. The only reason I left with it like this was I don't trust them to fix it. Not going there again.<//Text>

Extremely disappointing experience. The haircutter did a very poor job. At first, started using the machine like she was fleecing a sheep. When I objected, she started pumping cold water on my head and she acted as if she was doing me favor by using the scissors. I had heard you get a hot towel and good service but I never got that. On top of that, it was pretty expensive at $24 for an under average disappointing haircut! I want to give these guys 0 stars.< /review>

Took my kid there. The old lady Lynn was behaving like she is doing a favor cutting my boy's hair. Pathetic old women with an extra bad attitude<//text>

Basic needs for locals. Truly a store of convenience. They even dispense R.O. water here. I have been in this neighborhood since the late nineties, and I've shopped there all that time, I am certain they have  been in business much longer than I've lived in the area.< /Review>

< Review>
THIS IS A PLACE THAT DESERVES MORE THAN JUST FIVE STARS ! THIS IS A PLACE THAT IS NOT PERFECT BUT THE OWNER AND HIS EMPLOYEES DO THEIR BEST TO KEEP IT TO A HIGH STANDARD . I ENJOY WAISTING MY MONEY TO SUCH A PROMISING LIQUOR HERE . I THINK THERE IS NOT ONE BETTER PLACE IN THE WHOLE UNIVERSE AS UNION LIQUOR ! 😁 I THANK THE OWNER AND HIS EMPLOYEES FOR DOING SUCH A WONDERFUL JOB .< /Review>

Just recently went to this shop for the first time because I was referred through a friend and this is now the only shop I will be going too for any work done on my truck. Chris gave me a detailed explanation of what was wrong with my truck and fixed it with no hesitation. The entire staff is friendly and overall was a great experience. I would definitely recommend this shop & they have definitely gained a full time customer!</text>

<review>After being told by a different shop they would take over three days to "get to my truck" A mechanic told me about JACK's. Chris, had me out on the road by the next day. I won't go anywhere else.

<text>A good friend of mine gave me the referral to Jack Diesel,   Chris & Joel are Professionals at what they do, these two guys go above and beyond to ensure that your truck is repaired in a timely fashion. They get me in, they dont rape my pocket book, they are straight forward mechanics. They are always willing to help troubleshoot issues over the phone as well, just to keep me rolling, because as we all know "If those wheels arent turning we arent a earning"
Thank you Jack Diesel for Keeping Redman Van & Storage Rolling.< /text>< pictures>

The store is very small, the cashier who helped us was friendly she was helpful and she listened to your requests. She offered helpful amounts for the cup to be filled such as half three fourths or full. The problems I have are mostly the size and set up of the store as well as the fact they were out of the frozen yogurt I really wanted. I hate when places don't have one of the things on their menu.<//text>

Due to covid-19 it has taken our self-serve freedoms away and the staff don't make my frozen yogurt cups how I would like them.</review>

There's a nice variety of frozen yogurt flavors to choose from and toppings to choose from as well. At 49 cents an ounce, be mindful about how full you fill your bowl with, since your treat can get pricey. Overall, Yogolicious is a nice place to go for an occasional treat.</Text>

<text>Great selection of frozen yogurt. Price is reasonable. Bathrooms are kept nice and clean. Great service. The fruit toppings sometimes look old, but are generally good, and the candy toppings sometimes have a stale flavor or have gotten hard with age.</text>< time>

Great yogurt but could pass on Christian music playing. Not message as much as you know why they didn't make it in main stream music. Each song sounds exactly the same, ugh!< /Review>

<Text>I went in to yogalicious tonight at 8pm the girl that hat was working was rude no smile no welcome no nothing. It was my first time there with my two nephews . She was like don’t be eating the yogurt yet but with a attitude 😡 then she was like put them on the scale I said all of them she said in a rude tone YES. And as we sat down to eat she just kept staring at me and my daughter with this ugly look on her face. I have never felt so uncomfortable and disrespected. If she don’t like her job she shouldn’t be working there . You have to be out going and a people person with a great attitude. I will never go back there again !!!!!!!!!!!</Text>< Time>

Don't go in the summer. The location has their freezer units next to a bakery. So that plus the added heat in the spring/summer temperatures makes the yogurt a wet sloppy mess.< /Text>

Never been to Yogolicious, before. Staff had no interest in being helpful or informative; kind of made me feel awkward. Way overpriced and, unfortunately, I didn't particularly like the taste-discarded after few bites. Won't be back.</text>

Great frozen yogurt. All self serve so don't have much to say about the service. Just remember they charge you by weight so don't put on to many heavy condiments.< /Review>

Great flavors, terrible service. In the last 2.5 weeks I have gone 3 times. Today I mentioned that the recees pieces had been clogged this whole time. The girl working tonight told me that's not her job its the morning shifts. I was not being rude, just informative so they could fix it.and I could have more than 3 pieces in my froyo.<//Text>

We had an amazingly smooth experience with excellent customer service from our first phone call until the time we walked out with our new car.  It was the fastest we have ever been in and out during a car buying experience and they were able to match our loan pre-approval. Love the new car.< /Review>

<GmapID>0x80852bc7cf4e628d:0xf709cc96aee4b6bb< /GmapID><review>Took in my car for a recall service.  I live up in the mountains, so a bit far from any Kia dealership, so I have to drive 2.5 hrs to get my car serviced either in Sac or Davis.  I left a message four times to Greg, my service manager, as I needed the car done by the end of the day so I can drive back.  When he finally got back to me after 5 hours, he said they couldn't do the work because they don't have the part with them.

I asked why they weren't prepared to do the recall and Greg said they have to do an inspection first before replacing the part, because the part is "vin specific" and Kia requires them to do an inspection first before replacing.  So as I needed my car, I just didn't have the work done and drove all the way back home.

On my drive home, I called another Kia dealership.  I didn't tell them I already had the inspection done, but they looked up my vin, said they don't have the part for the recall and needed to order it first.  They will call me once they have it in.  When they had the part in, they called me to take in my car and get the recall done.

So basically, my service manager lied to me and wasted my time.  I'll do two stars since he was kind enough to smile while he lied to me and told me I wasted my time driving there.

I will be taking my business elsewhere.</review><name>Joshua Sia<//name><Resp>None< /Resp>< pictures>

Purchased a vehicle and they lost there gas card so they didn't fill up my car. I had to convince them to use there own money to pay for my gas. Then they only filled up 3/4 of the way. They are a bunch of idiots there. Would never buy a car from them again.<//text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Overpriced compared to other dealerships. You have to haggle to get market value. Sold us a brand new K5 and told us it had Kia's UVO application to control remote starts, AC unit, monitor servicing needs, etc. We tried setting up the UVO, but it wouldn't work. Called the corporate Kia office and they said this model doesn't have UVO accessibility. We were told the car was equipped with this capability.

It was one of two options: 1) they are completely unaware and misinformed of their products or 2) they lied to us to persuade us to purchase the vehicle.

I will be bringing the car back. I don't want to pay my hard earned money to companies that partake in unethical business practices.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80852bc7cf4e628d:0xf709cc96aee4b6bb</GmapID></record>

When I bought my car, I bought a set of tires for when the tires needed to be replaced. Since the time I bought the car to the time I needed to replace the tires, Hanlees changed ownership. They would not accept my already purchased tires and refused to put them on without charing full price. In addition, I make an appointment to service my car (just a simple tire rotation and oil change) and I am waiting for hours. What is the point of having an appointment????? It is absolutely frustrating.<//review>

<username>Iyona Copeland</username><date>1610903598535</date><rating>1<//rating><Review>Most dealerships are shady, but Hanlee’s of Davis is probably one of the worst in Northern California. I know Kia dealerships don’t have the best of reputation, but my experience with their Marc Maines (Finance Director), Dave Pilch (General Manager) and David Sotomayor (Finance advisor) has been a living nightmare. During these unprecedented times,  I went in to purchase a 2021 Telluride with a pre-approval from my bank, required information about my trade-in (registration and all), but somehow after signing multiple contracts (because they wouldn’t grant me the rate of my pre-approval. Should of been a sign to exit the door), 10 days later they found a mistake and wants me to pay for an unspecified amount.  Because I did not feel obligated to pay an amount that they were unwilling to share, I took the car back and received my trade-in in terrible condition. They drove 800 miles on it without purchasing it, it reeked cigarette smoke ( I’m pretty sure they allowed their staff to run errands, use it as a commuter or loaner car), passenger seat has a lump in it, their belongings left in it (sunglasses, old masks etc.), changed out the license plate frames, but could not give me back my custom chrome frames back, leftover chip crumbs in the back seat, white stuff on the front seats. It’s terrible, they should be ashamed of themselves.

All-in-all, Nora, Alyex, Dave, David and Marc are fake, incompetent, unprofessional and lack transparency. I would never go back to this dealership and have told all of my friends and family to avoid this place.

From my 6 years of experience, owning or leasing a Kia, seems like the corporation  only invests in their vehicles because their staff in dealerships are straight trash.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I told them they wouldn't be able to meet my unreasonable expectations. I was wanting something I knew was impossible. Well, I've found that nothing is impossible. They met my expectations and took on the challenge like the professional and honest team they are at Hanlees. I am now driving a brand new Ram 1500 that I never thought could happen. Expectations Exceeded!<//Review>

I've purchases two cars from them and was happy until recently. My most recent purchase in 2017 was for a Kia Sorento. I only take my car to them for service, which an upwards of $70 or more each trip which isn't cheap. My wiper fluid light came on, no big deal but it shouldn't have run dry since the last service. I let that slide. Something told me to look under the hood. I just got the warning message on my dash that it is time for service, so well I was curious....and come to find out I am almost completely out of antifreeze. That should be checked annually. I trusted they were doing the work and topping off fluids or warning me when it was time to have fluids topped off. Now my motor is in danger. I couldn't believe it. I tried calling to make an appointment. Can't even get them to answer the phone. If I call sales they'll answer but service won't. So now I am sitting around waiting on a phone call I'll probably not get. I wouldn't be surprised if they never checked any of my fluids. There is oil in the car. At least they changed the oil??... They never changed my air filter or advised me it needed changing. I realize that is a separate charge. I've asked that they change it and have been told, "Oh we'll do it next trip." Finally had the filter changed  when I purchased tires a few months ago. I need to find another dealer that will do the work. They clearly aren't< /Review>

He started us with a few trucks, after we test drove, we had to fill out forms so they can run my credit, after being there for About 4hrs, he comes back to say he wasn’t able to get response back from a lender to go home and he would call us the next day between 11-1, it’s Friday now and never did we hear back but I sure got my credit ran tremendous times making my credit score go extremely low. I’m upset I had to start making calls, when I was able to get a hold of Randy he said I’m very sorry we couldn’t get u any lender to help out, I said wow! It took u so much to run my credit to get this answer why not speak up and say your not able to help?? There issues is that they want you to put more money down up front instead to sticking on what you have said u would only put down,  and there definitely not willing to help u out when u bring in a trade in. Don’t recommend u coming here there such liars from the start. I had to put one star just to leave a comment but really they deserve no stars at all.<//review>< user_id>

I took my car for an oil change multiple times on Saturdays and they did a pretty good job in my opinion. Justin was one the service representatives and he was very courteous, professional and friendly. He made sure my car was well cared for. At the end he gave me a brief summary of how the car was doing and walked me through the list of things the mechanics worked on (or checked). I never had any issues with them and the pricing was very reasonable. Thank you Justin!!</Text>

I took my truck to Hanlees Dodge in Davis CA due to issues dealing with my Dodge truck had a great experience my service advisor Brian Holt really took good care of me no hassle and no B.S. they repaired my truck, they have good mechanics there I strongly advise if you have a Dodge vehicle and having issues take it to Hanlees Dodge and ask for service advisor Brian Holt he will take good care of you, it also helps that he was a Denver Broncos fan as well like myself.......< /Text>

My wife brought our 2014 Kia Optima in for the 75k mile service at 8:30 am. This service department gave her a quote of $662. My wife went to work and around lunch informed me of the cost. I was floored, to say the least. I called Roseville Kia and discovered they charge $209 for the 75k mile service.

I swiftly dialed Hanlees Kia service department to dispute the up charge of over $400. I was informed that my wife agreed to all of the services. I said, I understand that, but she went in ONLY for the 75k mile service and what you're telling me, you guys padded this with additional services. He agreed, that what was being done to our car, was outside the scope of the 75k mile service, but that my wife agreed.

I went back and forth about how my wife was taken advantage of here. She thought she was requesting ONLY the 75k mile service and the service tech made it seem like all of the services provided were a part of this. To add fuel to this fire, the $400 difference was merely flushing fluids and rotating the tires.

I recommend to anyone thinking about taking their vehicle to this service location to go ANYWHERE else. Any service department that requires you to research cost before entering is a danger to your wallet.</text>

The service here was wonderful everyone was so friendly and helpful and Brian in the service center was absolutely amazing!! Brian was the biggest help and if I ever need to take my Kia in for repair again i will definitely be coming back to this location. Its a bit of a drive for me but worth it 👍<//text>

True car even offered it at 12,100 dealer fees included.  When you show up they tell you there was a mistake on the pricing and the car is over $18k then try to steer you to another car they're trying to move. Old school 4square and finance games played here just like its 1971. Ridiculous glad this type of dealership is dying out. Wouldn't walk back in here if they were giving cars away. Photos for proof of the games they play here available on my yelp review for this location.</text>< Pics>

<review>This Dealership is a unlike any other one I have ever visited, but not in a good way. Many of the sales people are rude and treat buyers like a joke. The only sales person I recommend is Glen Miller. He will work with you on pricing and even calls the owners of the dealership to try and get you low prices. He is mature, well spoken, and respectful. He was wonderful to work with, be sure to try and see him if you are attempting to buy from this dealership.< /review></record></dataset><record>

The experience I had at this dealership was unreal.
After finding a car I wanted to test drive in an online ad, I called the dealership to inquire about the car. I confirmed that the car was still available and confirmed the price they were asking.  The next day I drive two hours and met with the salesperson I had spoken to on the phone, Cezar. I test drive the vehicle and decided I wanted to purchase it. I gave him the thumbs up...let’s proceed. He said he would prepare the necessary paperwork and we should be done very quickly. I was putting $5000 down and credit wasn’t an issue so it should be pretty painless. Next thing you know, he brings all of the paperwork back and starts going over it with me...here’s the price of the car, license and transfer fees, etc. He’s added in a hefty extended warranty (without asking me) so I begin to ask questions. After more discussion, I explain that I’m not interested in an extended warranty. I stand firm on this, I want the car but absolutely will not purchase this warranty. He then tells me that he’ll “need to talk to his manager” for approval because the dealership will lose money on the sale because they underpriced the vehicle. He then saunters over to the front desk area and starts talking to someone, then stands around with a disgusted look on his face. Eventually, I get up and go to the desk to ask what the problem is. Is he going to sell me the car, or what? He then tells me he has someone else coming to look at the car in a couple of days and they’ve already put a deposit down and it’s “first come, first serve”. So, he was ready to sell me the car 10 minutes prior, but now he has someone who’s already put a deposit on the vehicle... YEAH, RIGHT!!!!!??? Because I wouldn’t buy the warranty he was trying to force me to buy. Isn’t that something? Now I’m on the phone with my ride, saying for them to come back because I’m not buying the car...as I get ready to leave he tells me there’s one other option, if I agree to only put 2000 down, he can do it. He claims that the dealership doesn’t make any money on loans under 10,000. So... I end up agreeing to do it with the full intention of paying the other 3000 on the loan, immediately. It was a disgusting experience. Now, every time I look at my car I’ll be reminded of the shady little crook that represented this dealership. I will never buy from here again...nor refer anyone I know to shop here. Shady, shady, shady!</Text>

We recently bought a 2012 Certified Town & Country mini van from Swift. The buying process was smooth, but a tad lengthy- Nothing out of the ordinary though! We ran into a small cosmetic repair immediately, before driving away. Not only did they arrange the repair before we left, it was no charge. We also ran into an issue where an option everyone (them and us) thought to be on the vehicle turned out to not be there. We realized this about 2 weeks after buying. When we called to investigate, they were very understanding and took ownership of the problem. Not only did they arrange repair, they took care of us and the problem quickly and at no cost to us! Swift has a GREAT sales team, little to no buying “pressure”, and AWESOME service facility and Very Friendly staff! They are also very family and kid friendly too, even providing family friendly refreshments and entertainment room for the kids.  Our Salesman’s name was Rhyes (Reese) and we would recommend him in a heartbeat. If you need a used, new or Certified Chrysler or just service- Drive to Davis, you can’t go wrong! It will be worth it!</Text>

<review>Where do I start I went in to this place base on a flyer that I receive in the mail before I went in i call and as them about the flyer they told me it was good and I can get the price that was on the flyer so when I went in the sale person told me a different type of story then have my hope up of getting a car pick one out and everything after going there after I got off work spending 3 hours at the dealership to be told that we will call you on the next business day once the bank open up by the sale manager. Let just say I am still waiting on a call. After the sale manager gave me his word that he will call me and help me get into this car. Because I deal with so many dealership in my pass I knew he was not going to call i would rather for some one to be truthful with me in front of my face than to lie and that how I felt when I was talking to not Sam and Ron it almost felt like I was being look down up on if they would have call and follow up with what they was suppose to do I will give more stars but I feel like it was a bunch of lies<//review><Rating>1<//Rating>< gmapID>

I took my car in for a recall notice inspection. To perform he inspection the oil had to be drained. I was told it took approximately two hours to perform the work. 80 minutes later I was called and told my car was ready. Leaving the dealership I felt something was wrong. I noticed the speedometer had not been reset, and the sticker in the window for next oil changed due had not been replaced. I called my service advisor and told her my concerns but had to leave a message. I went home and parked the car in my garage and went out of town for two days. When I returned home and opened the garage door there was oil everywhere. I called the dealership and told them the car had leaked oil all over my garage. The response I got was that it was my problem; or I could drive the car back to the dealership (and cause more damage). I explained to the service advisor that driving the car back to the dealership could cause more damage and the response was for me to use my roadside assistance and have it towed back. Of course I refused to use my roadside assistance, and was told that if the dealership was to pay for the tow it had to go through the service manager. Not that I cared but I requested to speak with the service manager and of course had to leave a message. 9 days passed with me calling and leaving message with no return calls. I returned to the dealership and told them they needed to repair my car or that I would have it repaired and send the dealership the bill. 90 minutes later a tow truck was at my house to pick up the car. Four days later I receive a voicemail from the dealership saying my car was there and they didn't know why it was there. I called the dealership back a dozen or more times but could not get through to anyone; and finally was able to get to an extension where I could leave a message. Didn't hear anything for a few days; so I returned to the dealership and located my car before speaking to anyone only to see it was still dripping oil. I went in and spoke with the service manager "nice guy" and explained to him what happened. He told me he would have my vehicle looked at. Approximately four hours later I received a phone call saying my vehicle was ready. I was told that the issue was when the service department performed the recall service they took shortcuts and a part they should had removed before draining the oil they didn't and the part collected some of the oil, and that is what was leaking.

It took three weeks and I didn't receive an apology nor was I offered a rental car or any reimbursement. So you tell me would you recommend this dealership to family or friends?<//text>

<Time>1411604012437< /Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>We decided it was worth the extra drive, from Citrus Heights, because of the deal that Swift offered us on a new Kia Soul.  Justin contacted me right away after my initial inquiry and was able to find the exact car I wanted.

He was courteous and informative over the phone and our experience at the dealership was low-key and really pleasant overall.

So, all in all, a great experience - great car with all of the features I wanted, informative and helpful salesperson, and a no pressure interaction at the dealership.  Would recommend Swift and Justin!< /Review>< Pics>

Everyone knows dealer service departments are awful, but this one lowers the bar even more. Scheduled an appointment, showed up, and they couldn't perform the  full service. BUT nobody told me until AFTER I had been charged for the full service. That was my final time there. I've never had a good experience with service here. Nice sales people usually, the cashiers are great, and I like a few of the service people but overall I'm tired of getting screwed by this place. Hanlees has dropped the ball since acquiring the dealership.< /Text>

<text>We were traveling from out of state going to a wedding and was on a tight time limit. Our brakes over heated going down Donners pass and warped the rotors. We called them to see if we could get in and have the brakes checked. Knowing we were on a very tight schedule they put 2 guys on it and got us out of there quickly. Not only that my husband lost his phone there and I called Vic who found it and put it in his safe until we could pick it up after a few days. So needless to say we were very pleased with the results.<//text><Date>1528327519409<//Date><rate>5</rate>< response>

From the first time I saw my new Rubicon at Swift Jeep to the time I drove home with it, the people, especially Justin Spencer, made sure I got the best deal. The explained everything about the Jeep and all the bells and whistles, gave me a fair price on trade-in and made my payments truly affordable. Definitely a class act!</review>

I have been there 4 times. Once looking for a car. At that time, they ran my credit through over 10 banks (a separate report for each) which really hit my credit score. I ended up buying from Folsom Kia and got 2.9% financing with only 1 credit pull. The second time was to check a window switch. They found that my car had a recall for an electrical update, and did it then. Next time was to install the window switch. They told me it was going to take about an hour. 4 hours later, they finally finished it telling me it had a recall for the electrical programming. I told them itbwas already done, but they did it again. Assumeably to bill twice for the same recall. Last time was today for checking my washer fluid tank for a leak. They told me a rodent chewed through the hose. I don't have any rodents at my home and the car is predominantly garage kept. What a crock!!! Won't be back.<//Text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>I had to go back and update my review after the abysmal service I received. About a month ago, I took my vehicle in for major service costing me $2200. There was nothing wrong with the vehicle, it just needed the usual (timing belt, plugs etc.). A month later, the vehicle starts running rough and the oil light comes on. I take it only to be told it needs a new engine which apparently isn't available any more. They don't even tell me exactly what is wrong,just that it is dead. And, they ask me to pay them for the honor of having them tell me this. I can't help but question the timing of all this. Last time Hanlees gets a dime from us.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I called ahead and got a friendly response.  The salesman was helpful and when we arrived later we're treated well and even though we we're preapproved through our own credit union David (our salesperson) help to get us a far better rate through one of there banks.

My Family has bought two new cars from Swift in Davis, and we would go back again.  Each time we were able to get deals that other dealerships were offering with no problems, just make sure that dealer has the car still. They were definitely swift with getting all the paper work done and us on our way with our new cars.</review>

I purchased a car on 30 Sept 2018 from salesman named Eli. I have called seven (7) times and left messages for Eli to call me about newly found issues with my car and the DMV registration. To this date 30 Oct 2018 salesman Eli has NOT RETURNED any calls. I’ve spoken to a sales manager who have also given me the runaround! I’ve called numerous times and the receptionist is rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional!! After the salesman ((ELI) sold me the car it’s like he doesn’t want to be contacted by the customer nor the sales manager can contact him. I will NEVER buy another car from this Dealership. My experience with this so called dealership is NOT what I would recommend to anyone. Be aware of the salesman ELI and the sales manager as they only care about seeing the car leave the property and the service afterwards is awful!!! I give this dealership a “0” RATING!!! They don’t deserve a 1-star RATING!!!< /text>

DON'T COME HERE. GO TO KIA VACAVILLE - WORTH THE DRIVE  I bought my car and serviced it here when it was Swift and had fantastic experiences. Since it went to Hanlees it has been terrible. I brought in the car for service after I had some battery issues, which I mentioned to the service person. I was scheduled for major service, so I did that. They were late turning in the car back and couldn't provide a return shuttle. I took it all in stride. Eight hundred bucks a couple of days later my car doesn't start. Battery... I have to have the thing jumped in the middle of the night. Next morning I call them up and they are not willing to do **anything** for me. Called Kia of Vacaville and they had me in and out of there in less than an hour. Even with the drive from Davis well worth it. The guy at Vacaville told me he used to work there when it was Swift, but he left along with others. Shuttle driver told me same thing. All you have to know is that pretty much all their employees have left them. DON'T SUPPORT THIS PLACE AND AVOID NIGHTMARES.<//Text>

<review>I went with my son today. The salesman gave us a price on a car. It was a great deal so we decided to go for it.when paperwork was done my son signed everything then came and told me it was 500.00 more than the salesman told us it would be. We made our decision to buy based on the quote we were given by the salesman. I asked the manager about it and he said no that was the price, the salesman must have misunderstood him. My son did not say anything when he signed. I f I had been in the room I would have said no that was not the price the salesman gave us and left but it was too late. Even tho we still got a good deal I am upset about what happened, honest mistake or not.<//review>< Pics>

I recently bought a 2013 Dodge Ram 2500 pickup.  I saw it online and it had everything I wanted.  I went to the Swift Davis store and was met right away by Mark Peterson.  He was very knowledgeable on the new truck.  He worked with me on my trade-in through the final purchase.  This is the 5th vehicle I have purchased from this location.  All of my purchases have been a fantastic experience.  Roberto Padilla in finance made the paperwork flow with ease.  Overall I would recommend them to any of my friends.< /text>

<text>I'd like to review the dealership on its service and sales as I've had experience with both.  As many Davis residents know this dealership is now under new ownership.

Service: My experience so far with the service is that they did the repairs needed and got them done. I appreciate that the mechanic who was working on my vehicle called me to ask some questions and get more information on the problem. I think the service manager, Al, Amanda the Service Writer and Kellsey at the front desk did a very good job getting the parts in, notifying me on the progress of the parts, scheduling the repairs and getting the vehicle problems addressed.

Sales:  I have been exploring buying a new vehicle and trading my old one in.  Because I am looking at a higher cost vehicle I've decided to hold off until the end of the year or early next year to see if prices go down some.  But I did, however,  have a chance to talk to the sales staff.  I spoke with Adam, who works with internet sales and their sales manager.  I felt that Adam and the manager were responsive, pleasant and courteous to speak with, straight forward, professional in their dealing and I felt no high pressure or any kind of negative sales tactics.  Although I didn't up buying due to my decision to hold off on buying,  my sales experience with their sales department was very positive.</text>< Pics>

<rating>1</rating><Review>If I had the option of not choosing a star I would as my experience today was terrible. I should have not entered the dealership when I saw the "Under New Ownership" sign. Where do I begin! Long story short, I waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for my vehicles that I just purchased 6 months ago from this dealership to have the oil changed and tires rotated, as a deal with the previous owners they would drop me off and pick me up from work while my car was being serviced but this was not offered today, the previous owners provided me with a "Free Oil Change" coupon that the Service Manager (Zack Eck) would not honor, one older gentlemen waited over 2 hours for his car to be serviced, the receptionist was extremely overwhelmed and said that they are short staffed and not trained. If you can please avoid this dealership! Hopefully they can get the right management and staff in place.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<review>I wish I could give this place 0 stars.  I can't even begin to tell you the nightmare that the service department has been to work with.  I took my 2017 Kia Sorento in for warranty work due to an oil leak.  They told me it was just an "oil spill" that they cleaned up and sent me on my way.  A week later, the leak continued.  I took it back, and they kept my car for 6 weeks.  They broke my transmission and had to replace the whole thing.  They couldn't find the leak until about week 5.  I literally called the service department 10 times in one day and was never able to speak to a service manager (and they claimed they never got my messages).  Finally, after 6 weeks, I got a call from somebody new that my car was good to go.  Well, I learned that everyone I had been working with in the service department had either been fired or quit, and that the entire department had turned over in those 6 weeks.  I got my car home, and within 24 hours the heat shield underneath my engine FELL OFF in my carport.  What if that had happened while I was on the freeway???  Needless to say, I have to call a tow truck in the morning since I can't drive my car now, and I will also be contacting a lawyer.<//review><user_id>103307323164122636384< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

We had a fantastic buying experience at this store. We got a very fair price! Rhys had everything ready to go so we could speed thru the paperwork process. The GM, Sech, treated us like friends. I highly recommend this dealership!< /text>

This place is a joke! from the sales to management! They will all give you the run around. Stay away from this place unless you like being lied to and ripped off.

Updating now after waiting for over 2 months for hanlees to fix my car, and now instead of taking care of me they would rather give me my money back and forget about me.
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!</Review>

<Text>Hanlees has some good technicians left over from Swift.   The new folks in the front office have some "growing to do" but they have potential.   Be sure to ask questions on an estimate - there may be some items you don't really need.</Text>< pics>

Came in to buy a 2018 Kia Rio S model, I came out with an extended family. Huge huge HHHUUUGGGEE shout out to Jorge, Elias(both internet sales managers) and Alex (general sales manager). I researched Kia dealers from Freemont to Elk Grove and these guys went above and beyond for me. I never felt more comfortable at a dealership. It feels weird to say this but all these guys treated me like an extension of their family. I will without a doubt come back to these guys.

Jorge... thanks for your honesty and dedication
Elias... Bro!!! What can I say?? Thanks for finding me the exact car I wanted</text>

The service dept will take advantage of you. I took my car here for 1 issue and they tell me battery needs to be replaced and I allow. Day after I get my car the original issue is still there. Take it back and now they’re telling me it’s something else. They keep wanting to work on everything else about my car other than fixing the first problem. Please save your money and go somewhere else!</text>

I've looked for an AWD SERENTO EX for a month via internet. Found one on the Elk Grove Kia but recieved useless calls saying they'd get back to me. After 3 attempts over several weeks.I finally reached out to Eli at Hanlees. They didn't have the color I wanted but brought one over from Elk Grove Kia within a couple of hours, at a better price!!! They were all so nice and professional.  Wish I had started  there in the first place.< /Review>

<Review>Never in my life have I encountered an auto dealer who employs individuals that are more elitist, more condescending, more disparaging, more SEXIST, more fraudulent, more unethical and more misinformed than at Hanlees Dodge in Davis, CA.  The way they correspond with females including my mother, the way they concealed the available incentives and financial rates offered by Chrysler Captial, the way they treat other Chrysler dealerships; the way they lied to our faces and pretended to be in managerial positions when they were merely sales associates; the audacity to accuse us of making an illegal request at their behalf to purchase a new vehicle; I am astounded how this dealership even remains in business.  Is there no decency left in auto sales?  The BBB and FCA will be contacted concerning what we witnessed here.  And we will most certainly do business elsewhere.<//Review>< Time>

<rating>1< /rating><review>I type this review as I sit here at work reading the countless text messages from my disappointed husband, who is currently sitting in their office waiting to speak to a manager. Today's visit was bad enough to inspire me to finally write my full review of this dealership. Earlier last year after we purchased our truck, we came here because we had had issues with all the other Dodge dealerships in the area and hoped they would prove us wrong about dealerships having a rather crooked and snake-like reputation. Unfortunately, we've added this business to a long list of places to never support ever again. My husband scheduled an Early Bird appointment for 8am today to have a recall issue handled. It is now 3:35pm (at the time of writing) and he is just now being handed the keys, after being told yesterday that it would only take two hours and then after being told this morning that it would only take three hours. Oh, they also said they would call him when it was ready. 12pm came quickly and he called to no answer. Every half hour thereafter he continued to call and still no answer or courtesy call back. Finally, he decided that he should probably request that the shuttle pick him up since closing time was coming quick. He shows up and they say they're "finishing up the truck", or in other words it still wasn't done seven and a half hours later. The service tech even has the audacity to have a bad attitude because my husband is now cranky, having been waiting all day long for his only form of transportation. To top it off, the truck reeked of onions as if someone either took my husband's truck out to lunch or just decided to eat their lunch in it. When asked about it, the tech blamed the new catalytic converter that was installed! Riiiiiiight, bro... How unprofessional can you get at this point!? The sad part is that this is just one bad experience out of at least half a dozen at this dealership alone. Unless you like being treated with zero respect and the utmost unprofessionalism, I highly suggest you stay clear of this shady place!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I would recommend everyone to travel to Davis, CA and stop by Swift Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram & Kia (Aka: Hanlees). The atmosphere is refreshing and not pushy. I was able to relax consider my choices, weight the odds, contemplate my options and come to a reasonable satisfaction. Jon McCann was outstanding and answered all of my questions, listened to my desire and concerns. If I had to do it all over again, I would definitely go to Swift Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram & Kia (Aka: Hanlees). I love my new Kia Soul. It fits my personality and my size. They were awesome. I even managed to go on the day that they served a meal. Yeah!!! Happy Driving.<//review>

<name>Allen Yee< /name><text>This review is for an experience 1-2 years ago.

At the time, KIA cooperation was giving out $50 just for test driving a KIA. All you had to do was bring in the form and get it signed after the test drive.

When I arrived I presented the form to the sales person. As soon as he read the form, the sales person was not too happy about me test driving KIA. From his facial express, I can tell that he doesn't want to deal with me because i was just there to waste his time. (yes, I know I wasn't going to buy a KIA, I just wanted the $50 but as a sales person who represent a business, you should always assist your customers in the best attitude; you never know if I'll come back in a couple years later and give you my business.)

The test drive was awkward because of this.

At the end of the day, he signed the form and I got my $50 from KIA corp 3 weeks later.

The Service department is great so I'll give this review 3 stars.</text><Rate>3</Rate>< pictures>

<Review>Went there to look at a used 2012 Sonata they had for sale. Test drove the car as well as another Kia with Mark Peterson and had a great experience. Not only was he well informed about all the ins and outs of the cars, but he was incredibly friendly and genuine. We had to get gas for one of the test drives, so I spent more than a normal amount of time with the guy and there was never any pressure or sales pitches. He popped the hood and informed me on some of the stuff which he seemed to genuinely enjoy, passing on information rather than trying to seal a deal.

Fantastic experience and a great guy - if you end up going to this dealer, ask for Mark Peterson and you won't be disappointed.

I gave it 4 stars because after I put in a number, Mark came back with his manager and he wouldn't budge a cent on the sticker price. The car had been ridden hard, racking up almost 40k miles in one year, so buying without any haggling was out of the question. I walked out without making the purchase, which takes one star away from the 5 star experience I had gotten prior to sitting down.</Review>< Response>

<Review>I have purchased 2 vehicles from Swift in the past 2 years. The Sales department is fantastic. I would recommend ONLY using the sales department at this dealership. Do not waste your time with the service department. I have referred several of my friends to purchase a vehicle from Bhaskar as he is a class act. He is honest, caring, and trustworthy. He will go above and beyond to make your sale go as smoothly as possible. Thank you Bhaskar for going above and beyond for your customers. It is greatly appreciated. Many of my friends have also purchased vehicles from here and agree with the fact that Swift has a fantastic sales department and a horrible service department.

When it comes to the service department, they are absolutely horrible. You are better off going to your local auto repair shop and not this dealership. Scott is a jerk who happens to be racist. Charlie, the service manager is just as bad. Recently I dropped my vehicle off for a few minor issues. After having my vehicle for several days, nothing was complete. I called Scott and he would not return my phone calls. Each time that I called, I would play the classic bounce around the department because nobody knows what the hell is going on game. I eventually drove down to the dealership to pick up my vehicle where I was met by Scott. He was very rude and even used profanity towards me. He then explained that the parts needed were on backorder for a month. I told them to give me the keys to my vehicle and  I left. I have filed a complaint against the dealership with Chrysler Corporate as I should not have to take this abuse and horrible customer service.

The very next day I brought my vehicle to another dealership and the repairs were done in a half of day, The same parts that were on back order were Magically available at another dealership. I should have gone to this other dealership from the get. They were kind and respectful. They even filled up my tank free of charge. That is called customer service.

Unfortunately I had to return to Swift to have insurance work done that was paid for by my insurance company. I was sitting in my agent's office and he called Scott to schedule an appointment. Scott was rude to my insurance agent and spoke very bad of me and even used profanity on the phone with him. Fortunately, my insurance agent recorded that phone call and has turned it in to Chrysler Corporate for review.  Shame on you Swift. Your sales department was so great. But your Service department sucks.  Sometimes a dealership needs to clean house and start fresh... Start by firing Charlie and Scott.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
We are extremely disappointed at how your dealership handled our effort to buy a Kia Soul from you.  We are well qualified well established purchasers and we live in San Diego and and attempted to co-sign on a purchase with my sister who is disabled.  The mishandling and reversal of information to purchase (despite my credit and income being well above the minimum qualification) leaves us feeling misled and treated unfairly.  I will be entering my bad experience on YELP and any other way I can make your poor business approach known to others - in the long run.  It feels like ethnic bias.
The requirements were all met and at the final stage I am required to make a trip up there to complete the purchase after it was agreed that it would be handled by mail.  It also sounded like you wanted the deal to be canceled and for us to pursue a San Diego deal.  We will but we will make sure that KIA headquarters knows about Swift's poor business practices and poor communication.<//Review>

A few mins later we were approached by a sales person who didn't even introduce himself, and had obvious stains on his shirt, I wasnt even sure he worked there for the first few moments. After he appraised my trade in we went inside and he most certainly had no idea what he was doing or saying, it got to the point to where another guy had to come out and help him explain everything cause the first guy wasnt doing it right, yet he's been a certified sales person for years? He was also pushing to do a credit app, even with saying we're not sure if we even love the truck, especially since the info online wasnt correct about it. None of the employees seemed to be very enthusiastic about being there either. Overall we didnt buy and we won't return.< /Review>< response>

Excellent Sales Department

FIRST please make sure you ask for Jarrod when you go out for your test drive! I find it really important to give credit when credit is due. Jarrod is an exceptional sales associate. I promise you will be happy you asked for him.

I read through several posts on Yelp and I thought it was really important to say what an outstanding experience I had at Swift Chrysler Jeep Dodge Kia thanks to Jarrod and Jon. So, here's the back log:

I had spent several days in search of a new vehicle. I can say, it was probably one of the most frustrating quests of my life. With a newborn in tow my husband and I set out to find the perfect family vehicle. After visiting about 2 handfuls of dealerships we hadn't found something that fit our family needs. As a last effort to find something, I had my husband call Swift to see if they had any  Town and Country Mini Vans. To my luck they did. I went up to Swift my self from about 30 minutes away, as promised Jarrod had the van pulled up front, all ready with the keys to go for the test drive. I really liked the van, it was pricer than I had originally planned to spend, so i headed home, and went in search of a better deal. I couldn't find one. I'm a deal finder by nature and it wasn't possible I searched the entire bay area all the way to Santa Rosa and all the way to Roseville.  I worked with Jon to set things up so my husband and I could come in and pick up the van that evening, it went perfectly. We absolutely love our new van.

So, with all that being said. Thank you Jarrod and Jon for an exceptional buying experience. I appreciated all the knowledge you had of the vehicle and the time you took with myself and my husband. I highly recommend this dealership for your Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Kia needs! Again please make sure you ask for Jarrod when you go out for your test drive!</text>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>3 experiences with Swift Kia:

1) Four/Five star Sales service:  Trying to buy a car: saw a car on their lot I really wanted, worked with the internet sales department to purchase the car. Unfortunately it didn't happen at that time, I had to hold off a month to buy the car, in the meantime the car was purchased, when I was ready again I contacted the department. The department worked very hard, and was very responsive to getting me the car I wanted. Although I did not end up getting my car through Swift had I not found 1 other dealership that undercut them by just enough, I would have been glad to buy from Swift. Their prices were fantastic, the sales services was great, friendly and did not pressure me.

2) One star service: Getting my car serviced: Since Swift is the closest dealership to my office it is mighty convenient (15-20 minute walk). I have a long commute so my car needs regular service. I'm sad to say, in general the service department is awful. Not kidding: Almost a serious/very frustrating issue every time.  Here are a number of issues:
*I do wonder if these are largely exclusive to KIA since they’re a relatively new KIA dealership
-Wrong oil in car
-Told me no issue with radio, when it produced an audible clicking noise, had been documented as a warranty issue, wouldn’t brainstorm ideas for fix. Another dealership helped me find a solution, 2 weeks later, Kia released an official update. I drove a car with a semi-faulty (obnoxious) radio for 8 months…
-Shuttle service twice told would pick up ‘immediately’.  1 hr later no pick up-turns out they were in Sacramento-I found a different ride; 2nd time 20 minutes later no pick up-turns out the guy was lost, service writer didn’t provide proper address, I had to verbally give him directions.
-Service writer improperly writes service tickets
-Service writers don’t know squat about cars, attempt to explain and really screw up what was actually done, raising huge concerns/explains improperly written service tickets
-Service writer clearly drunk/hungover upon arrival
-Very high prices for synthetic oil
-Shoddy research on warranty problems, I feel like they don’t contact Kia upon first visit for warranty problem, third visit they finally corrected the problem after I provided the Technical Service Bulletins identifying the problem
-Multiple attempts to make changes to my car it doesn’t need (ie: new tires, new turbo)
-Cashier is a dolt

3) Four stars for Management: While their Service Manager works very hard, is very nice and resolves problems above my expectations (hence 4 star); the frequency of problems I've encountered is terrible.  Kia sends surveys post service and I always answer, Management always calls to apologize and I have received correction work for free, and a few discounts. But really I’d just like to not have all these issues.

Long and short won’t be going back again, unless I really have to. I will find another dealership to do my warranty work, and will go back to my old guys for general service.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x80852bc7cf4e628d:0xf709cc96aee4b6bb</GmapID></record>

One day driving back from a pumpkin patch I noticed Swift Kia off the freeway and stopped to look. Lots of good choices. I followed up online and noticed the prices were very low for the SAME SUV's that I had looked at before. We finally set up a time and went and finally purchased our new vehicle. We got a 2011 Kia Sorento EX. We had just looked at the same one at Roseville Kia for over 5-6K more! The service was great and they were very helpful. Overall great experience.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80852bc7cf4e628d:0xf709cc96aee4b6bb</Gmap_id></record>

But the real problem occurred when i went to the change the oil months later. A tech [I hope it was not a mechanic] used an air tool to put the oil plug back in and rounded it...completely. It was completely destroyed. Had to pay another mechanic to rip it out and replace it. Awful service<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< Review>
Called to place an order at 10:30pm and after employee reassured me that the order would be made and ready to pick up in 15mins I pulled up and lights were off, location closed and nobody picked up the phone anymore. Extremely disappointed with the poor service employee provided being that she completely made it seem as she was legitimately taking my order, provided me with specials and even gave me a total amount for my order.
It would be much nicer and logical to let the customers know it is too late to place an order instead deliberately fooling clientele.</Review>

<review>The only reason why they get 5 stars is the employees that takes my order. Trevor and Andrea I believe that's their names would get ten stars. Pizza is alright. I wish a Pizzeria would do a NY style pizza or a croissant pizza.<//review>< Rating>

<Review>It's sad to see the state Fry's is in now days. This was always one of my favorite places to go. Now...its like an electronics ghost town in the verge of becoming the next Radio Shack.
The TV section is gone. The shelves are barren.
This feels like the end.

So sad..

Does not accept cash above $20. There is no documentation online or at the store of this fact. The cashier talked to the manager and all he had to say was there used to be a sign. I'm not going back to this location. Their attitude is going from bad to worse. All I had was two $50 bills and an emergency credit card. This is ridiculous.</review>

Very disappointed for the customer service and manager doesn’t want to keep their customer le happy. Will never buy from them again and you shouldn’t too.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Never answer their phones! I stood in the front waiting for someone so I can pay. I watched the employees stand there doing nothing while phones rang. Good thing the recipes are easy to follow or everyone might be too stupid to figure it out! Worse Pizza Hut ever!<//Review>< pictures>

<name>Miranda D<//name><Date>1571546380582< /Date><Rate>1</Rate><text>We had 2 pizza's delivered within 30 minutes. When We opened them they were completely destroyed and raw. When we called the guy back on the phone he was incredibly rude and told us that it would be 95 minutes to get new pizzas and that we would have to RETURN the old pizzas. When we arrived the cashier ,"manager" as he says, was immediately rude. He wouldn't even open up the pizzas and look at them? What? He didn't care about anything we had to say and was smug. When we asked him for a delivery and tip refund he refused and said they are remaking the pizzas. When we told him that we had to drive the pizzas back ourselves he had the nerve to say "you didn't have to, you chose that". Of course we chose to drive 5 minutes down the street to get new pizzas rather than wait the 95 minutes it would have taken them to re-deliver.  Because of how combative and horrible he was, I asked to speak to the manager to which he claimed was himself. When i asked him for his name he hestitated with "Trevor" which I'm sure is not true. I then asked for the corporate number and the response I recieved was "look it up online". They don't have access to the corporate number in store? When we finally asked for a refund, he said "we already made the pizzas" to which we replied that we still wanted a refund. He stated that we couldnt take the pizzas which we were very clearly aware of. He even walked back into the kitchen and told the cook "sorry your time was wasted". He also stated that he was unable to give us a receipt for proof of refund because it's their policy to refund at the end of the night when they close at 12am and we could come back then to get a receipt if we wanted to. He laughed and smirked through the entire interaction. I told him he was giving us horrible customer service and the response was "im sorry you feel that way". Never once were we offered an apology over the phone or in person. He refused to look at the pizzas stating he would do it later and acted as if we were inconveniencing them for trying to return inedible food.  He also at one point said that he was not going to put us ahead of other customer's during their rush. I'm sorry, but I have worked in food service my entire life and anytime you mess up this badly you're supposed to make it right not argue with the customer and refuse to give them a refund reciept. He also went to the back to initiate the refund and when he came out never did any transaction on the actual register.

We went to the other location in San Marcos and asked the manager there what their policy is. She stated that everything he said was absolutely untrue and that their policy is actually to give the customer the return reciept immediately because when you enter  a refund two receipts print out and one is for the customer. She was fairly confident that he didnt enter the refund.

All we wanted was a refund for delivery and tip, but he was combative from the moment we walked in. One guy in the back actually yelled "get out of here" while we were there. This location needs to do some serious re-training or a complete re-hire. I'm disgusted with the "customer service" we "recieved".</text>< pics>

Used to think the food was good here and the service just was terrible. Now I know its both. Recently bought a large pizza for carryout and got it home ro realize there were 15 pepperoni on the entire pizza. I looked online and it states there should be around 54.
So what i recieved was not even close. After communication with corporate they decided to send me a free replacement pizza coupon. It has been 2 months and still hasnt come so I can only think that it never will. Stay away from this location if you value food quality, any sort of decent customer service and be from corporate/management.

And then theres my last review of this location:
The help is hit or miss. Waited for thr 3rd time lately whilst the counter guy talked with friends for over 20 min while my food got cold. Unfortunately this is an all too common thing at this location. Would absolutely go somewhere else if there was another option.<//text>

I just moved to this area so I apologize for not knowing EXACTLY which Pizza Hut i am supposed to call that delivers to my home MY BAD. HA I spoke to 2 different associates and they were some of the rudest people I have ever had to speak to. I will NEVER support this pizza hut, for the simple fact that they are RUDE and have NO customer service skills.</Review>

The store manager is absolutely the best person I've met in ages that runs a store. Most of the time, store managers are bitter, preoccupied people in a hurry to move on to something else instead of engaging the customer. However, This store manager is so great! He cares about his customers like they're his friends, what more could some one ask for?</text>

<name>Omar Rivera<//name><review>Ordered delivery  on 1/4/2017 and it came 25 minutes late. I called the store and spoke with destiny who was extremely rude and sided with her team rather than the customer and the obvious facts of the email I received. We ordered two medium pizzas and an order of breadsticks. We received one medium and one large and no breadsticks. Destiny had zero authority to do anything and chose to "not be chewed out by her manager" than to help a customer. Worst service ever, we got no receipt no breadsticks and received our paid food 25 minutes late and we were the aggressors for trying to find a solution to the issue. I was told to speak with the general manager shea who was unavailable because he's sick. This whole experience was ridiculous

Update- I was supposed to get a call from the general manager shea and to this date I have receive zero phone calls. Worst service ever experienced.< /review></record></dataset><record>

My 5 year old has been visiting Dr. Fridgen since his first dentist appointment. This is an amazing kid friendly environment. They offer shows for the kids to watch and have a balloon lady dropping off balloons during Covid. Previously she was there live and made balloons on request. My son is not a cooperative patient and screams for teeth cleaning and yet everyone we have interacted with is amazingly patient. Also my son has decided rather than being a ninja when he grows up he is going to be a ninja dentist, so they made a great impression on him as well.</review>< Resp>

Dr. Victoria was amazing with my 2 year old son! She was so patient and gentle with him. She was very thorough and took the time to teach me how to best care for his teeth at home. The whole team understood how to make the whole experience fun and safe for my son’s first dental visit.<//Text>

<Text>This is an amazing place for young kids to get their teeth worked on.  My 5 year old loves going to the dentist since he gets to watch a show/movie that districts him from the cleaning.  The only reason I gave a 4 star and not a 5 is that, as a cash paying client with no dental insurance, it's pricey for a cleaning .<//Text>< rating>

Dr fridgen did an awesome job. My son feels very comfortable with him. He has a great chair side manner and explained what he was doing in terms that were easy to understand. His assistants are very friendly and helpful. He has a remarkable touch and confident ease working on my son's smile< /Review>

We loved our first visit here! My daughter is 2 and can be nervous in new places and she was so comfortable. They had disney movies playing in the lobby and tons of show/movie options to keep her distracted during the actual cleaning. They put us in a private room for the first visit which I really appreciated, I think it really helped my daughter feel comfortable. The whole appointment was a breeze and the staff and Dr. Fridgen were so nice. Covid wise it felt very safe and I will definitely be bringing my daughter back. She actually smiles when we talk about the dentist now and is more inclined to brush her teeth.</review>

My daughter been going here for a while now and  this was her first time not using Nitrous I was  so worried she wouldn’t let  the dentist remove her tooth but the did very good as always and numbed her so well she has 2 teeth removed at once!’ I was very proud of her and very glad the dentist and dental assistant made her feel comfortable enough to go through with this procedure<//Review>

Love them! We came here by recommendation from a family member and I couldn’t be more grateful. My Son has not had a bad experience here and fingers crossed he never does. The dental assists are amazing. The Doctor is always kind. Even the folks at the front desk are warm and happy. The atmosphere is great and inviting for kids. I remember growing up being terrified of the dentist, I wish this place was around then. I even recommend my sister-in-law for my niece since they haven’t had the best luck with their previous dentist office. They love it as well.

Thank you for the amazing service !<//review>

We were brought to Destination Smiles because our son had a tongue tie.  Dr Ligh explained everything so well, he mad sure we were comfortable with everything from the procedure to the exercises both pre and post procedure.  Showing pictures of everything and teaching is hands on. He was very good with our infant and his staff was awesome.  They walked us through our insurance in advance so there was no surprise bill, they were great about covid cleanliness, and aware of the special needs of a family going through this rough patch with their new born.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Dr. Victoria, Sujey and Claudia are amazing and helped make my daughter's first appointment magical. Technically my daughter had a first appointment at my dental office but it wasn't kid orientated and it scared her so we don't count that attempt. Our experience from scheduling over the phone with I believe her name is Christina, was easy and it was helpful that the forms were online. The only thing about that process was when we arrived there was one form needed to be signed by her dad (insurance holder) but we didn't receive an email for that form so I'm not sure if we missed it or it wasn't included. Dad  had to drive out to the appointment while we were being seen otherwise we would have had to pay out of pocket.

Despite that little stress, the balloons, movie selection, headphones, safety measures, the No Cavity Raffle board and most importantly all of the staff's upbeat, pleasant attitudes set this dental office apart. Now I know why this office was highly recommended and I too shall highly recommend this office. Sujey took special care with Keira and did a great job demonstrating to Keira how different tools would feel like in her mouth before using them on her which I'm sure put my daughter at ease. Dr. Victoria was super friendly and knowledgeable and we are so grateful that Keira can be her patient. In the end Keira came home ecstatic and wanted to go back to the dental office. She has to wait six months for the next check up but her excitement is a testament to her positive experience. Thank you Destination Smiles!</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

My son Jayden started to see Dr Fridgen when he was 3 years old and he is almost ten now. He had terrible cavities at that time and luckily we found Dr Fridgen. Dr Fridgen fixed them and taught him the correct way to clean his teeth and  keeps his good habit until now. Dr. Fridgen is a responsible, nice and friendly. Highly recommended! Dr Fridgen is deserve the five stars!👍👍👍< /Text>

Destination smiles is customer oriented and we felt safe visiting during covid restrictions.  We were the only ones in the waiting room and chairs were spaced accordingly.  We had a private little room for the cleaning and checkup.  We found destination smiles after needing a second opinion on my daughter’s abscessed baby tooth with another dentist with offices in Los Gatos and Willow Glen who recommended we wait three months, put her under and then pull it out while she was asleep.  At a cost of $3000, we went to destination smiles and they said they could pull it out with local anesthetic and saw no reason to go to the trouble and danger of putting my daughter to sleep. (The other dentist said she my daughter was too “anxious”  to be still for the procedure).  Destination Smiles expertly handled her and distracted with a movie, talking her through the procedure and reassuring her as needed.  She needed a spacer after the extraction and the totally savings was $2000 and we didn’t have to worry - over the summer while traveling - about her abscesses tooth splitting open and causing pain or getting into her blood stream for a trip to the emergency.  If your dentists logic seems off or the dentist seems anxious over handling a child who is a little afraid, then perhaps they’re more oriented toward making money than the actual needs of your child.  I highly recommend Destination Smiles and their trustworthy assessments of what dentistry needs to be done and what doesn’t.<//Text>

<time>1605605182887</time><rating>5<//rating><text>Amazing staff. From the front desk to the dental hygienists everyone was so sweet and made it so warm and welcoming for the kids. They are up to date with Covid -19 protocols and has a ventilator + air purifier in each room, and even does the acid fogging twice a day to kill any airborne viruses and bacterias. Each station is separated by plexi walls to help protect the patients.
My son was given headphones to watch a movie while getting his cleaning done. The hygienist was so gentle and explained each step to him so he wasn’t caught off guard with a tool in his mouth.  He did amazing during the cleaning. He used to hate other dentists but he loved the staff here. In the end, he was given a toy car and a bag of goodies to take home.
We are so happy to be apart of destination smiles.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Most friendly and caring environment.  Even the process of going through safety measures during this covid year was comforting.   My teenager has been seeing the same dentist since she was 3 years old. Teenager went for her 2021 cleaning and experienced the best cleaning she has ever had.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808fcb3d87bf8903:0xc91183ebb0ccc0ba</gmapID></record>

<text>Before COVid, I would say this was one of the best dental places to go and even my children loved this place but after COVid they could care less about health conditions of those who couldn’t wear masks and was able to at least wear shields for a covering. Not only that was a problem with no alternative available, when my son had an emergency tooth issue we came All the way to the set emergency appointment to be told to come back two days later when initially was told that at the appointment that was made he’d be treated. We had to turn around and immediately go somewhere else who said themselves our situation should have been handle the same day. Horrific experience having a 5 year old with a tooth emergency that couldn’t be treated as a priority. They just lost 3 customers for poor customer service.

Before COVId this place was a fave for my kids. However, My 5 year old had an emergency tooth appointment and was not treated at the appointment that I made for him to get help the same day. I was already heart broken not being able to sit in with him since wearing a face shield was unacceptable when it’s acceptable everywhere else as a face covering especially with those with health issues, but this place was beyond not helpful nor understanding and lacked putting my son’s trauma to his tooth issue as a priority. Luckily another great group took him in and helped us with our emergency. This place will not get any more of my referrals and I would definitely not recommend them!<//Text>

This was the most positive experience we've ever encountered with a dentist, thank you! To Dr. Ligh and all the nurses, thank you for treating our son with such kindness during his first dental surgery.  Everyone who worked there was genuinely so nice- multiple nurses checked in just to say hello and welcome us. Dr. Ligh was timely, professional, patient and truly wonderful-he even gave us his mobile number and welcomed our calls any time for his post opp. If I could give them ten stars I would, thank you!< /Review>

<Text>I’m so grateful that we found Dr. Ligh. I was sure our newborn had a tongue tie or oral tie of some sort because of several symptoms she was exhibiting and Dr. Ligh cane highly referred by my midwife, pediatrician and lactation consultant. He was very thorough in explaining how he assesses oral ties and what the procedure would look like. He also was very thorough in giving the care instructions for the wound after the procedure. The staff are all very friendly and helpful too which is great. I’ve had such a good experience here that I’m thinking of switching to this office for my 5 year old’s dental visits. I would not hesitate to recommend this practice to anyone in need of pediatric dental work and especially for oral tie assessment and correction.<//Text>< Pics>

Dr. Ligh and his staff were excellent. They were extremely helpful from the start, understanding my concerns and working with me to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Dr. Ligh called me and followed up with my concerns before the appointment. During the appointment, he was very thorough, explaining everything about the tongue and lip tie procedures. I appreciate his honesty. After the appointment, his staff went over billing. Overall, I was very satisfied with our experience.<//Review>

Dr. Kwong and his staff are terrific. They are friendly, kind and very gentle with my children. I especially appreciate Dr. Kwong's thoroughness with every detail. When my daughter's retainer didn't come out exactly right the first time, he re-did it to make sure it was a perfect fit. Two of my three children have beautiful smiles thanks to Dr. Kwong, and the third one is on her way to having one as well.</text>

Dr. Ligh met with us to discuss our newborn son’s possible tongue and lip tie. Our breastfeeding journey up to this point has been very difficult. We were so impressed with his knowledge and how much compassion he showed us as first time parents. He is a breast feeding specialist as well and had some great tips to share with us! He also spent a great deal of time explaining tongue and lip ties, as well as the details of the procedure. He acknowledged our feelings and answered all of our questions. We are planning to go ahead with the procedure later this month and feel confident that Dr. Ligh will do an exceptional job. I would absolutely recommend Dr. Ligh to any new mama out there who is struggling with breastfeeding!</Text>

I really love Dr.ligh she is AMAZING with my daughter! To the point my daughter enjoys going and she is 5 yrs old! I give the doctors and assistants 5 stars!!! But sadly i am only rating 3 rather say 2.5 but its due to the front! The lack of organization and knowledge of what is going on with your childs work. they make you feel like wrong and rushed. I could have sworn i was being charged twice but Andrew made me feel like i was avoiding payment after they do not allow me to pay day of they make me pay 2 weeks a head so they charge me day of when it works for them.</Review>

Dr Kwon made a great impression on my son and my family. We are just starting his orthodontic plan and we appreciate his clear approach and explanations. Also the all office does a great job during this Covid 19 crisis by making sure social distancing is observed, by taking your temperature before you enter and by minimizing the number of patients and family members present in the facility at the same time.< /review>

Today was our first time back to the orthodontics since shelter in place started. We were VERY impressed by the changes that have been implemented. We love the new check-in system and all the extra precautions that the staff has taken to ensure a safe and positive experience for both the patients and parents. THANK YOU!< /review>

Dr. Dinh, Jackie, and Van are THE BEST pediatric dentists. No question.  Dr. Lam is OK. They make you and your children feel at ease and accepted. They are warm, human, and considerate. Never met a male doctor in 40 years to give me disheartening news with genuine empathy and a hand on my shoulder, but these fabulous doctors do. I have 3 children and have gone 8 or 9 years now. Dr. Jackie and Dinh ask how we've been and make us feel incredibly comfortable. They are real and appear to understand children and their habits. We are moving soon out of California and so sad we will NEVER find another set of EXCELLENT (FEMALE=GO WOMEN!!) DOCTORS that compare. Love love love them and their wonderful long-term staff.<//text>

Wonderful place for children. My son has special needs and this is the only place he can somewhat tolerate. Mostly I’m impressed by their patience and willingness to wait for the child to be comfortable. So far, they are unmatched. Both Doctors and Fatima have been the best for my son.<//Text>

<text>Great experience for my 7 year old. No complaints. Always super clean, helpful and experienced staff, in and out. My son had sealants put on while watching Charlie Brown. Great place! This is what I wished there was when I was a kid!< /text><username>Ben Guzman< /username></record>

< review>
I had an appointment to get braces today and had a question concerning my payments. I called "TAMMY," the lady in charge of those payments and asked her a question. She put me on hold, hung up the phone after 6 minutes and never answered my question. She quite literally hung up on me. And when I tried to call back, my number had been blocked. A disappointment indeed, an extremely unprofessional move. Hope you guys have a better experience. I will be getting my braces elsewhere.< /review>

From emergency visits for tooth and gum injuries, to routine exams, to a treatment plan for braces, we've used services on both sides of the office.

<Review>My wife and I took our 5 year old into Destination Smiles today 3.16.20 to  have a filling and root canal performed and our experience was nothing but exceptional!  We're very happy and thankful for the way they performed and operated with our little guy.  Dr. Van and the staff were amazing, thorough, and patient with my son and us.  We previously went into the center for my son's examination and we were referred to go here from our regular Dr. Rabitz who is also a great dental facility.  The doctors/dentist were super patient with my son's x-ray who was not a fan at all but they persevered through it.

It will be a tough decision on where to take our kids for future regular check ups as we love both Destination Smiles and Dr. Rabitz.  But can't say enough about the awesome care and everything about Destination Smiles.  Thank you!!!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>We have consistently had great experiences at this pediatric dental office! With three young boys, we are at the dentist at least a couple times a year and I am always amazed at how friendly and well-trained the staff are at dealing with young children of all temperaments.  At our most recent visit, both Jasmine and Dr. Ligh were very aware of my son's anxiety about the dental treatment and did all they could to be sure he was taken care of quickly and with great care.  At our last visit, Dr. Van also took great care of my son and was thorough with her explanation of the procedure and the options.  The doctors and the staff are all courteous, well-prepared, and focused on their patients.  Additionally, I like that the staff seem to be well-cared for, especially during this COVID-19 time - they have access to proper PPE and they also seem to be given the right encouragement for a job well done.  Thank you, Dr. Ligh, Dr. Van, and all of the staff! We appreciate how well you take care of our children!< /Review>< pics>

<Review>We went to see Dr Ligh for a consultation and revision of our son's tongue tie. I was so impressed with Dr Ligh's knowledge in the subject as well as with breastfeeding, and his clear passion for his work and commitment to his patients and families. He is full of positive energy and was very reassuring. The front desk staff and all of the assistants were great as well, but especially Jasmine. She made the procedure as pain free for me, the mother, as possible. If it weren't for Covid, I would've hugged her afterwards. If we are in the area when it's time for my baby to visit the dentist, we will absolutely bring him here. THANK YOU!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

My wife works for a general dentist and their office regularly refers patients to Destination Smiles. The excellent feedback from referred patients about Dr. Fridgen's professionalism, kindness, and patience inspired my wife and I to take our baby to see him. We could have taken our baby to where my wife works, but it was worth going to Destination Smiles, as they were very attentive and flexible to meeting the needs of young children. Fatima provided excellent service, attention, and care for my little one; she was very patient and informative about the entire process, which was important for my baby's first dental visit. My 18-month-old had a pleasant experience and we look forward to the next visit!< /review>

Everyone is so friendly and nice. They take the time to explain what they are doing and let the child feel the equipment. They make sure the flavors are okay - my daughter hates mint, and they make sure to give her flavors she likes. They have shows for them to watch while doing exams and the atmosphere is very welcoming! Great place!</Review>

The office is clean, spacious, and welcoming.  Staff are friendly, professional, and quick.  Dr. Ligh is as good as all the reviews says.  He was thorough, friendly, and knowledgeable in his explanation about the posterior tongue tie my 3-month old had.  We felt very confident in his expert hands.  I also felt even better knowing that he is a breastfeeding educator.  Things went smoothly from beginning to end.< /text>

We have 5 children under 10 and foster children. This practice has been amazing. It's very kids friendly with lots of distractions from any and all dental work. The assistants and cleaners are patient and kind and the doctors are as well. They have always treated our children with the utmost kindness. One of our foster children only spoke Russian a d their Russian speaking dental assistant spent two hours gently coaxing her to at least get xrays. It was really amazing and restores faith in humanity. Highly recommend!<//Text>

Dr.Ligh along with all the Dr’s and the staff are always the best in handling our kids.  They provide the best pediatric dentistry in San Jose, period.  My amazing pediatrician recommended Dr. Ligh several years ago to me because she always trusted Dr. Ligh & staff with her kids dentistry.  That was a true testament to me and I’m so grateful for her recommendation.  We always have a good experiences and that not easy to say with children’s dentistry.< /review>

Dr. Van and her team (Lida and Tracy)  put our minds at ease when we arrived with a tooth emergency. It was our first visit and we felt more than comfortable in their hands. The attention to detail and quality of care they showed my daughter and myself during a somewhat stressful situation really helped us get through it. I appreciate them so much!<//Text>

This is such a wonderful environment for kids visiting the dentist. Not only is the atmosphere amazing for kids, the staff is fabulous and puts the kids and parents at ease during procedures.  My daughter loves picking out a movie off the menu to watch during her dental visit.

The orthodontist is amazing too. We have been using these services now for 8 months and it’s amazing.  We had an appointment this morning and were in and out so quickly.  Everyone is always so friendly.<//review>

The team at Pediatric Dentistry & Orthodontics are so incredibly friendly and accommodating. My son was completely at ease watching the provided movie and even joking around with his hygienist. We even were able to get x-rays for the first time. The office is has the up-to-date equipment and the waiting room is comfortable with a lot of activities for the kids to do to not get bored... not that you'll be waiting for too long since the office is also well staffed.<//text>

We took our baby to Dr. Ligh for a possible tongue tie and couldn't have been happier with our experience. He showed us pictures ahead of time of normal frenulums vs tied tongues, which made it clear to us that our baby was tied, then examined the baby pointing out the indicators. We opted for a release procedure after weighing pros and cons. He gave us space to ask questions and never pressured us to treat. He was supportive of us parents throughout the process--explaining things ahead of time so we felt comfortable with the treatment plan, giving thorough and easy to understand instructions for aftercare, and letting us contact him as much as needed afterwards in case we had concerns. He also allowed us to hold her during the procedure, which was comforting. We would recommend him to anyone! The only downside was that it took a couple weeks to get in for the first appointment--he is busy because he is awesome. It was worth the wait to feel the level of comfort that we had.</Review>

All the members in the dentistry were kind, very friendly and passionate about their work.
I was not comfortable in giving my son anesthesia. So, I requested them to try laughing gas. Dr. Van did a great job of keeping my son comfortable while performing the dental procedure with just laughing gas. Dr.Joseph seem to be a very kid friendly doctor. I liked the Dentistry over all.<//Text>

I LOVE this dentist office! Immediately upon entry into the dental office, there is a welcoming and comforting feeling. Beverages for all and an area for the children to play while they wait. The dental assistance are just as great as the dentist. Dr. Ligh and Dr. Frigden have both worked on my son's teeth. They always make my son and my experience great. The variety of movies that children pick from to watch while they are being worked on is amazing! This dentist office is truly in business to ensure great quality dental work and positive experiences for children. I recommend everyone to this dental office.<//Text>

Dr. Kwong was knowledgeable, patient, caring, and honest. I don't think we could have had a better experience. After going to so many specialists, including medical doctors, developmental pediatricians, speech therapists, and occupational therapists, I finally know what the issue is with my child, and Dr. Kwong laid out how to address it.<//text>

Dr. Fridgen has been our kids dentist for perhaps 8 or 9 years now, and we've always been really happy with the care and service provided here. The staff are very friendly and put the kids at ease, and the facility is spacious, modern, and spotlessly clean. Would definitely highly recommend to anyone looking for a pediatric dentist for their children.< /Review>

Great service by Kelly and detailed explanation about my son’s treatment options by Dr. Kwong. Happy from my 2 visits so far.
Update: after almost more than a year of treatment, I still have the same opinion about the great service they provide.
They are good at reminding people and following up.
Thank you again. Great people.< /text>

<Review>Dr. Ligh and his staff were awesome! We recently had our 11 week old evaluated for a tongue tie. Dr. Ligh was so patient, kind and thorough in his explanations. He educated us on our options and gave great attention to detail so that we were well informed about the entire process. He was so patient and gave us plenty of time to privately discuss as a family before making our decision to move forward with the procedure. He had us practice the aftercare so that we were well equipped to do the post-procedure care at home. Their office is beautiful, clean and well thought out, with separate rooms for the procedure and books (educational) to keep kids entertained. The staff was amazing. We knew it was the right choice for our child to have the release procedure, but it can be hard to watch your newborn cry. When I started to get emotional the staff was right there to hand a tissue and then give me some space. And when I needed to nurse my baby an assistant was right there to help give me privacy. I highly recommend Destination Smiles. Thank you for the amazing work you do.<//Review>< user>

<review>Took my 3 year old daughter here for her first dental check up and we had a great experience! From the moment we walked in, everyone was so nice and attentive to us. She is very shy and I was pretty convinced there was no way she was going to open her mouth at all, but she did! She also got to pick out a movie to watch, for balloons because it's her birthday next week, got a toy on the way out, and to top it all off a balloon artist made her a balloon of a Monkey climbing a tree - she had the best time!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Dr.Jackie is AMAZING! She definitely knows how to work with kids. Today was my was 8 year old daughters second visit for tooth extraction and sealants. We arrived 20 minutes early and were seen 5 minutes after walking through the door. I didn't catch the dental assistants name but she was super friendly and amazing as well........it definitely was a fast visit. my  daughter didn't make not one peep lol. At the end of the visit Dr. Jackie says , okay we're all done. I say "wait, aren't you going to extract a tooth?" She said,  "yes, we did it already". I was seriously amazed. I watched he whole time and didn't even realize they pulled out her tooth. I literally thought they were putting sealant on her teeth.< /Text>

If you're looking for a pediatric dentist.... look no further! They are extremely professional, honest and gentle. Dr. Fridgen is excellent with kids. He knows exactly how to communicate with them so they understand what is going on.  I've been to 4 different pediatric dental offices and none compare to this place. They are upfront with the fees and sends you home with estimates so you're not bombed with a bill 3 months later. Kayla is heaven sent! She is the hygienist for initial visits! My kids LOVED HER!!!!! He gentle, funny, kind and very considerate of your child's feelings. She knows exactly what to do and what to say. I am so extremely happy with this place. We're staying!!!!!!!</text>

My daughter was never happy to go to dentist prior to coming to Destination Smiles and was not looking forward for her to get braces, at all.  Luckily, my daughter has had a very pleasant experience and always looks forward to coming here.  The entire staff has been very receiving and has provided exceptional service.  Dr. Kwong has been very patient and caring when explaining procedures, expectations, outcomes for my daughter's treatment.  I recommend Dr. Kwong and his team, including Dr. Rideau who treated my daugher during an emergency.</Text>

Absolutely amazing experience! I am pretty particular when it comes to teeth and dental work. This was my daughter's first trip to the dentist (she had actually fallen and hit her two front teeth). Not only did Dr. Rideau accommodate us, they did it with kindness, care and concern for our daughter. I can't thank them enough. I am so glad we found such a warm, friendly, professional practice to bring our daughter to. Thank you!!<//review>

Son did well for his first visit. Dr. Ligh came in for the last 2 minutes of the appointment telling me to hold my sons arm or we'll be here all day. Mind you dental assistant was holding his head and his dad was laying underneath him. Dental assitant did a great job distracting him and us parents too, but I felt like i was being scolded to do something with a little attitude. Not coming back.< /Text>

First time visit with a almost two year old can be a little daunting, but the staff and dentists at Pediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics in San Jose could not have been better.  They were able to entertain my son while I checked in, the staff helped keep an eye on them,  had toys and programs to watch while we he got checked out by the dentist.  The Dr. Jacky was so helpful and took so much time to answer all my questions.  This appointment was amazing and I wish they had dentists and office staff that are so well organized, efficient and kind for adults!<//text>

We were referred here by our pediatrician. We went to 4 other dentists in last 1 year before coming here and this is our final destination. My 5 yr old is so much comfortable with Dr. Van and all other staff that she is excited to go for a treatment :). Facility is awesome and staff here really make kids comfortable for treatment. Highly recommended !!!</review>

I’m a general dentist who has been referring patients to Drs. Fridgen, Ligh, and Van.  I’ve always heard great things about them from my patients.  I got a first hand experience earlier this year as a parent/patient when I brought my toddler son to see Dr. Fridgen for his first check up.  I had no experience with infant/toddler dental care and I wanted my son to see the best in the field.  I was very impressed by how well every member of the team worked together, all while being very sweet, caring and professional.  My son who at 16 months old struggled to let me brush at home actually sat still and kept his mouth open for a cleaning with Fatima the first time and recently at his recall with Amy.  Dr. Fridgen has given me sound advice on how to care for my son’s teeth and what to watch out for.  The balloon ladies put the icing on the cake!  Rebecca made a cute balloon doggie on a leash and my son enjoyed “walking” his new puppy.  Destination Smiles is a place we look forward to visiting!  They know how to create a positive experience for children and parents!< /Text>

<Text>My son is 7, and on the autism spectrum...  Today is the first time a dental hygienist has been able to successfully clean his teeth. The staff at this place is AMAZINGly patient. I explained ahead of time my son's sensory issues so they had us in a room with a closed door, which I think helped A TON.
Our hygienist, Fatima, was super sweet- she introduced him to all the tools before she began her procedure. She went really slow with him and explained every little step. He loved her!
And Dr. Ligh is a very friendly and thorough dentist.
Not to mention, every chair has a personal TV installed in the ceiling and the kids get to choose from a big list of movies to watch while they get their teeth cleaned. We absolutely love this dentist office! Highly recommended!</Text></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
The kids are alright. Dr Fridgen and Dr Ligh are both friendly and thorough. The office staff are helpful and the office is nice. I tend to be wary of larger offices that can be less personal, but the Dest. Smiles staff do a very good job, and are great at making the kids comfortable. (honestly, it's mostly in the movie selection!) Both our kids, girl and boy 6 and 11 have been well taken care of. Billing has been straightforward and well explained.</Review>

The only reason for the 4 star is because they are really good at what they do, if not it would be a 2. Reason being is that nobody mentioned that our dental insurance coverage was maxed out until after the appointment was over so we had to pay out of pocket for her cleaning. It would have been nice of them to let us know of that before they did the cleaning or while they were leaving us messages and voicemails of her upcoming appointment. We would have at least been a little more prepared for this unwelcomed surprise.</Text>

We came to Dr. Ligh when our baby was 9 weeks old, with a posterior tongue and lip tie.  I had been strugging with breastfeeding (mastitis, thrush, poor latch), and was very apprehensive about doing the procedure.  Dr. Ligh took the time and was very thorough in explaining the impact a tongue tie can have to breastfeeding, what the procedure entailed, and post op stretches to ensure success.  There was no pressure in the decision making, and he gave us the time we needed to consider how to move forward.  We decided to do the procedure for both the tongue and lip.  Though I'm sure he has a ton of patients, he made me feel like I was his only patient.  After the procedure he shared with me his personal number to call anytime I had concerns.  At one point he let me come to the office above a beyond what was covered by insurance to double check that the tongue had not re-attached.   He also spoke to my lactation consultant 3 times, as well as meeting with my chiropractor to ensure my daughter was making the right progress.  It really does take a team, and I'm so happy that he was part of it.  Our daughter today has good tongue elevation and movement, and we are working on improving the latch.  Slowly but surely!  I'd highly recommend Dr. Ligh--do no hesitate to at least schedule a consultation if you are struggling with breastfeeding!< /text>

Both of my daughters love going to their dentist. They both had some fillings done. They never cried or complained about anything through the whole process.  Even my oldest one (9 year old) came out of the dentist asking when she has to go back again. She can't wait to go back  :)</review>

We went here for a frenotomy procedure and they did an excellent job explaining the procedure, going through next steps and preparing me for the 1 minute procedure. Dr. Ligh is extremely kind, thorough, understanding, patient, and knowledge. I felt extremely confident in his assessment and underestimating of the procedure. I would highly recommend them!< /text>

Love love love Destination Smiles! We just took our son for his first visit to the dentist and we couldn’t have asked for a better experience! As soon as we walked in I was amazed at how clean the office was. Toys, books, ipads, and refreshments were plentiful, and kids actually seemed happy to be there! Fatima was amazing with cleaning his teeth, and Dr. Fridgen was able to do a thorough yet quick check-up. The tv mounted in the ceiling playing Cars and the balloon artist helped put my son at ease as well. We completed the appt with a special prize from the prize basket. It doesn’t get any better than this! Thank you, Destination Smiles!< /Review>

i've been seeing dr rideau since i was 12 years old. i'm 29 now and have always come back to him for orthodontic needs. The doctor and staff are hands down the best office in town and should be voted best of silicon valley or best nation wide! i've done business at many places and have never been treated so good than over here. They are literally the nicest people...Lorena, Dr. Rideau, and Dr. kwong, and the rest of staff have all treated me excellent.<//text>

I love this office. My kids have been going there for the last 13 years. The service is always great and Dr. Fridgen is the best. The hardest thing is scheduling appointments (even when 6 moths out), perhaps I need to stop referring people there.. haha. I asked about this and the front office said they reserve afternoon appointments for those kids 6+ in age. Perhaps it would be best to change morning appointments not only for under age 6 but elementary kids all together, since they are in the same classroom all day, where as middle school and high school aged students miss a whole subject/period/teacher while attending medical appointments. Aside from that, I am extremely happy with this office.<//Review>

Dr Ligh is fantastic! He has such a good rapport with the patients, great "bedside manner", and is really good with both the kids & parents.
The staff are great, very friendly & easy to work with. They have TV screens on the ceiling above the chairs so kids can watch cartoons while they are being worked on, balloon animals, toys, etc. My sons actually ask us to take them here even when they have no appointment!</review>

From the dental hygienists, dentist and orthodontists they just handle things so well for the children.  Our first visit was 8 years ago when my then 18 month old dove off the end of the couch and chipped a tooth.  They helped us get our reimbursement from medical insurance and going forward very gingerly worked with my so. To get him through X-rays and dental cleanings.  Flash forward to getting ready for braces and my son was having his spacer removed and was nervous about having new impressions, he gagged at 7 when he had impressions for the spacer.   They were patient and coached him through the process so his fears were alleviated.  Even though we moved to Morgan Hill, we still drive the 20 miles to see this group of dentists and orthodontists.</review>

This pediatric/ortho dentistry is amazing! They are great with all kids! They do what they can to make the child feel comfortable and everyone there is so friendly. They are gentle and patient as well. Their waiting room has plenty of books, toys and even iPads to keep the kids occupied.  And to top it off, they have a large selection of movies the kids can watch while getting their teeth worked on. My daughter actually loves going to the dentist!
Update:
Due to Covid-19, a few things have changed in their office EXCEPT for the exceptional service the dentists and staff continue to give. Of course, there are no iPads or toys in the waiting area anymore but the kids are still able to choose/watch a movie while their teeth are being worked on. I am very happy with how things have changed. Everyone there has taken the patients (and themselves) safety and health into consideration during these tough times.</Text>

Dr. Van is amazing for my daughter who refused to see a male dentist. She is the best dentist, so kind and excellent with fillings and sealants. I'm thankful to have found her. The rest of the office is stellar as well. And they have kid iPads and tvs in the ceiling so kids don't dislike dentistry.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I was so impressed with my six year old daughter's visit to Dr. Fridgen this afternoon. From the initial phone call to book her, to the office and waiting room, to EVERY single person that interacted with her.
She was nervous, but her fears melted away moment by moment. The woman that cleaned her teeth and did some x-rays was so so so patient with her. It warmed my heart to see someone so gentle and supportive toward my child.
The kids can choose movies to watch over head and use headphones during their appt, there was even a woman there making balloon animals for the children!
It truly was the best experience we've had at a pediatric dentist. I asked my daughter what she thought on the ride home and she said, "I LOVE THEM ALL!!!".</text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1526051781622, 'text': "WOW THANK YOU!

My three-month old had a tongue tie that was causing breastfeeding to be very painful and also my milk supply to drop. Dr Ligh met with us to discuss the procedure to release the tongue tie. He gave us research and armed us with articles and examples.  he even showed us a video of what the procedure would look like. He took time to help us with the stretches a couple days after the procedure and even offered a Saturday appointment! I can't recommend Dr. Ligh enough!< /Text>

Bottom Line: Dr. Ligh is a solid guy and an expert on tongue/lip tie releases (procedure is called a frenotomy).  He is very knowledgeable when it comes to breastfeeding latch challenges caused by an infant's tongue and lip ties.  I highly recommend him to anyone needing that procedure for their infant and have already recommended him to others I've met struggling with the same issues.

Further Details:  Dr. Ligh saved my breastfeeding relationship with my son.
I went to Dr. Ligh after 9 weeks of exclusively breastfeeding my son with constant pain and trauma to me (my son was thriving the entire time, thank goodness) and on the verge of a second bout of mastitis.  Previously I had been to 2 pediatricians, 1 ENT, 5 lactation consultants and 1 dentist who each recommended holding off on releasing his lip tie (which was obvious) and misdiagnosed his tongue tie (they all said he didn't have one).  Dr. Ligh appropriately diagnosed the tongue tie (it was posterior submucosal--the hardest to diagnose) and released both tongue and lip in the office.

The frenotomy is a quick procedure (under a minute).  Dr. Ligh uses an electrocautery pen rather than a laser; it is just as effective and has the added benefit that you can hold your baby during the procedure, which was important to me.

Dr. Ligh's follow up care was also excellent.  He clearly explained the tongue and lip exercises that are necessary to prevent reattachment and then followed up to ensure the exercises were going well and the wound was healing properly.

5 stars also for Dr. Ligh's staff, especially Ernestina.  She was extremely responsive and helpful in getting us seen especially on such short notice given the worsening of my symptoms.</Text>

<text>When our beloved pediatric dentist was forced into retirement due to a health issue, we were left with the doctor who bought her practice.  It was clear after two visits, that he was not a match for our family.  I asked around my community, and was led to Dr. Fridgen at Pediatric Dentistry.

We had our first appointment this week.  From  the moment we walked in the door, we were treated so kindly.  Everyone with whom we interacted was professional and friendly.  The kids enjoyed being able to watch a movie during their cleaning (at our previous dentist, they only watched a movie if they had to have work done.)  This was a particularly helpful perk for my anxious child.  It was just enough of a distraction that she didn't flinch or reach out for my hand even once.  Fatima, their hygienist, was gentle and quick.  The kids commented that the foamy fluoride treatment was so quick, and much better than what they were used to.  When Dr. Fridgen came in to do his exam, he was friendly, easy to talk to, and had a nice sense of humor.  I appreciated that he spoke directly to the kids about what was going on in their mouths.  They were comfortable enough to ask him questions, and he gave them straight, easy answers.  He told us what his plan and recommendations were, then we went back out to the waiting area where the kids played on the iPads while I made our follow-up appointments.

I appreciated how thorough Kim was in explaining the treatment plan and the projected cost.  She knew specific information about my insurance plan, and was able to tell me what would and wouldn't be covered without me even asking.  When we got home, my youngest told my husband that their new dentist is "the best dentist ever!"  I'm so relieved to have found a new, excellent provider for my kids.< /text>< pics>

His staff is always courteous, helpful and professional. At our most recent appointment, my son was a bit worried about a possible issue down the line in regards to his braces. My son had the confidence to ask Dr. Rideau about his concern. At the end of Dr. Rideau's explanation, he paused and reassured my son that he would do his best and all he could do until the teeth were to my son's satisfaction. Who says such things?

Doctor Fridgen is super nice and patient. He made me and my 4-year old son feel very comfortable and well cared for. After the procedure, Dr. Fridgen even texted me that night to check on my son and made sure everything was OK with him. He answered all my questions and cleared all my concerns with great patience before and after the procedure. I would highly recommend Dr. Fridgen to anyone who is looking for a kind, caring, experienced and responsible pediatric dental specialist for their children.<//Review>

Dr. Ligh and the staff were amazing! Very informative, friendly, thorough and professional. The office itself is a treat for any kid with the toys, books, ipads and tv options to keep kids calm and entertained.

We had to go to get our daughter's tongue tie corrected, something we really didn't want to do. But Dr. Ligh and his staff made us feel welcomed, comfortable and at peace. Would highly recommend!< /review>

<date>1513149524835<//date><Review>We absolutely love Dr Fridgen and his team.  He always provides personalized care to both my kids.  Staff at this office are always kind, punctual, and personable.  I couldn't be happier anywhere else.  Clean and fun, my kids never dread going.
We also see Dr Rideau next door.  We see them nearly every six weeks and everyone is kind and welcoming.  They make extra effort to make my kids feel comfortable, welcome, and involved in their care.  I also love the women in the front office - they are so personable and really work with you.  Whether it is scheduling appointments, obtaining records, or even just trying to get our dentist and orthodontist appointments figured out.  We actually were just for the dentist onMonday and my husband had scheduled an appt for the orthodontist the following day, and instead of returning the next day, they fit us in.  This is common practice at this office, they are more than happy to try to make things work and I really appreciate them all!<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1503417590901, 'text': "Our goal is to create dental visits that are easy and hopefully ensure return visits.

I had a great experience here as a first time patient! The team here is super friendly and professional (Amber, Kasey, Gayanne, and Dr. Oh) and everything is very clean. All the instruments are covered in plastic that is thrown away after use and all surfaces disinfected. They use what seems to be the latest modern equipment with high resolution digital images. It was cool getting to see my teeth from multiple angles in color. Dr. Oh felt like an old friend and was very gentle on my teeth. I didn't even need an anesthesia for the filling. I'm so glad I switched from another dentist nearby who was gruff, seemed in a rush, and told me I had over $500 in cavities whereas with Dr. Oh's team I paid only $140! Talk about being glad I switched! I don't normally write a long review or take a photo with the doctor, but I'm just that surprisingly happy with the service here!</review>

BEWARE | THEY WILL OPEN A CREDIT LINE WITHOUT YOUR DIRECT AUTHORIZATION.

AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST. No wonder they have a 2.7 star rating.

Fiancé had an appointment and without signing any documents or agreeing to any financing agreements they signed her up for the SMILE GENERATION FINANCIAL credit line. This did have a hard check on her credit.

This is a horrible business practice and I do recommend looking else where.

They are also extremely persistent and will do their best to get you to say yes to getting things done there at their price, and in this scenario automatically sign you up for financing that was not requested or authorized.

We will be looking to file complaints through which ever avenue is available to us.< /text>

I would say that this would be good place to visit, if you need a dentist. Staff are very friendly and welcoming. They practice covid-19 safety measures here to keep patient as safe as possible. They offer various dental service here.</text>

<Time>1603813375081<//Time><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I wouldn't recommend this place at all. After putting asleep I got charge extra $264 and I don't even know why. While exposing this to one of the desk lady she kept on saying "I'm an adult, you could've walked away". How could I? I was already falling asleep with the IV in my hand already. And avoided to answer why the extra charge. If I knew they were gonna charge me more money after getting this surgery done I wouldn't have gotten this done by them. I also check another review after posting mine some other people got charged extra money too. So before you get any type of surgery done or any other service in this place. Make sure they won't charge extra right after they give you a price. And on top of this, I understand removing wisdom teeth are painful, but this man took around 40 minutes when my wisdom teeth were impacted. He never checked on me not even ONCE to see how I was doing. I had to take so many pain pills, other dentist take they're time to not hurt the patient as much. My sisters dentist took 2 hours to get them out. Take this place as your last resource maybe other places are More caring and honest when it comes to treatment and money.< /Review>< Pictures>

This was a great referral from my dentist, her words "if I needed inplants this is who I would go to"

From the start we met Angela, phenomenal person!

I'm going in for surgery and she made me feel right at home.... fantastic person, if I had an opening I would hire her.

I did not get three folks name... Each one of them was equally caring, professional, and charismatic.

1. The lady who just recently broke one of her teeth and did all my X-rays was awesome, great humor and attitude.
2. The assistant who took me to rooms... Could tell he wanted to do well and was very professional.
3. The Office Manager , main compliment for him was very caring and knew what he is doing.  Even told me about his personal experience with getting a dental implant made me feel more comfortable.

Dr. Jun Jeong..

Personable- Yes
Professional- Yes
Talented-Yes
Confident-Yes
Felt entrusted- Yes
Do I highly recommend Dr. Jeong- Yes

Like most, I really do not want to go to the dentist my experience with Rancho Cordova was something I will remember ... positively.

I went back for a follow up... Guess what? Same experience and people remembered me.

I met two new receptionist on my follow up appointment and they were equally as memorable.

I highly recommend<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>EVERYONE PLEASE READ! No I don’t work for them and no I’m not getting paid!!!
They get bad reviews because people get them confused with other Rancho Cordova Dentist offices! Please make sure you have the right one. I don’t like seeing a amazing place with bad reviews and the reviews were meant for another office. Do your research and check for yourself how many there are. It’s easy to get the wrong one. I almost posted on another Rancho Cordova Dentist. Look at the pics and make sure it’s the right place.

I came back to post my 2nd review and seen I never summited this review. I have to say Rancho Cordova Dental group really helped me. Friday evening I experienced some horrible pain in my mouth that would not go away and was only getting worse as the night went on. Dr Jun came and checked me out and helped me get through till the next morning (Saturday) and had me in the office seeing Dr Junsuk who did xrays and gave me antibiotics and pain medicine and gave me a quote on what needed done. The immediate help I was able to receive was amazing and very quickly! Such a huge relief the help they gave me and wow very recommended for anything! Great staff! Payment plans for anybody! Thanks to the best dentist I've ever seen. I am the biggest baby when it comes to dentist and normally cry! I did not cry once! Very caring and very helpful! Thank you from the bottom of my heart Rancho Cordova Dental Group.

My 2nd review from last weeks emergency visit

Dr. Jun and his staff stepped up quickly the last 2 visits I had with dental emergencies 3 or 4mths apart.  Both times I was in tears and freaked out. My smile is me. They were able to get me fixed up quickly and back to my smiling self. This last visit I walked in because I thought my 2 crowns in the front came loose from a doctor doing them 8-9yrs ago. I was thinking oh he can glue them in and I'll be on my way. Well doctor Dr Jun did a X-ray and my natural teeth broke off at the gum line in the crowns and I didn't know until he showed me on X-ray and barely touched the crowns and they fell out. We made a quick plan then because I was bawling because I was not walking out of there with 2 missing teeth in the front and he said I'm not going to let you. He definitely took care of me and I have 2 new beautiful crowns. I can not thank him and his staff enough for taking such amazing care of me during the dental emergencies. I highly recommend him and his staff for any dental care you need. Also very loyal, they actually do work you really need done and not something they just want to make money off of. Best Dentist office, I swear!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Rate>1</Rate><user_name>Catelyn with a K< /user_name><review>I am raising a personal grievance on my dental office, orthodontist to be more specific due to the inconsistency in the direction from the plethora of orthodontist I have seen. Doctor Scott who was my previous doctor had assured me that I am ahead of schedule for my braces treatment and would be getting them off January of 2019. Since Mrs. Natalie La Rochelle, my current doctor has taken over my contract I have been seeing negative results and my teeth have regressed and worsen since she has made changes to my treatment.

Long wait time when having an appointment set up, lack of professionalism in office such as not being able to remove my chain linked rubber bands without smacking against my lip causing pain, not offering extra rubber bands or wax for braces, pain from wires being too long, the inability to insert wires into the proper brackets causing extreme pain to teeth and causing brackets to break off, also having to re-bend wires or choosing not to add detailing to bottom or top wire causing teeth to move in wrong direction and when attending the next dentist appointment I express my concerns numerous times about bottom teeth moving back to original position and my top teeth becoming projected in opposite directions. Mrs. Natalie La Rochelle who is my current orthodontist, when asked how much longer I have remaining in my treatment she was unable to answer and responded with “I am not really sure with the way you’re teeth have shifted I can not give you a rough time frame “. I have voiced my concerns on numerous occasions with not only my current her but with the office manager Jeff Bright who did not seem too concerned with the issues I am having. I then had to asked two separate times to be transferred to another orthodontist and the office manager told me in a very condescending and unprofessional way that I would have to do my own research to look up other offices who take my insurance when it is his job to refer me to another office. I was finally able to get a consultation after speaking with Amber Marley the benefits coordinator from my current office, for Friday February 23, 2019 with another orthodontist who happens to be their sister office. They refused to listen to the concerns I had with my current orthodontist and said that they would charge me 500$ to take them off and to put their braces on and would charge me another 300$ for my retainer on top of signing a whole new contract with them. I am very frustrated with the inconsistency of direction from the plethora of orthodontists I’ve seen and I am very distort and extremely unsatisfied with the results that I have seem since the change of doctors. I would like a full refund of the amount that I paid towards my treatment, a termination of contract with this current orthodontist so that I can peruse a different dental office I am satisfied with. And on top of all of this I JUST found out that the current orthodontist who I am having issues with is NOW putting in her 60 days and leaving yes that right I said LEAVING as well. This is ridiculous to have to go through this just for braces.</review><date>1554510883272</date><pictures>None<//pictures>< Gmap_id>

Dr Jeong is wonderful!!  He is kind and cares about his patients.  He helped me out after hours and relieved my tooth pain in preparation for a root canal. He and his dental assistant, Angel, were absolutely wonderful in my time of need.  I would highly recommend Dr. Jeong and his staff!</Text>

The one and only time that I went here, a basic check-up and cleaning took 3 hours despite my having made an appointment. The dentist tried to sell me services that were not necessary and not covered by my insurance.  I'm now well past the time for my next checkup and I haven't been contacted, but I think that it's for the best as I'm looking for another dentist.< /Text>

<date>1475003442289</date><Rate>1</Rate><Review>The problem with this location is that the organization is absolutely terrible. While I the dentist and dental hygienists have all been professional, and even some very good, none seem to stick around long enough for you to  or build a relationship, or build any trust. The office staff constantly seems lost, or behind, or maybe they just don't care.

There is never any legitimate follow up from anyone, appointments are constantly rescheduled (see above about staff not sticking around) and some of their dentists or hygienist, visit so rarely, that a reschedule could be weeks away. Forget about any sort of emergency situation, they don't care.

In the end, I just can't trust my care at this location. I have had to force them to explain costs or procedures, as often lower cost options were never even presented as an option. I have even had a hygienist furious that a recommendation for a dentist to see an issue was dropped by the staff and she had to make sure they got me in, because she was so worried.

The location may be convenient, but I have to say, it is just not worth it. This is simply a place I would not recommend anyone trust with their care.< /Review>< pics>

Overall, it was a very good experience. I am super afraid of dentist and was put to rest almost immediately. I was seen almost immediately, introduced to the dentist, and his assistant. They then took x-rays which was the first time in a long time that that didn't hurt. Was taken to a room and seen shortly by the dentist who then looked at my teeth to see what needed done ,his manner and use of tools was very gentle and kind. He relaxed me almost immediately. They did a lot so it did take awhile but everything was explained before hand calmly and clearly. Compared to my experience before with this same dental facility before its remodel and other employees this was a breeze. I feel it is very good to excellent for this visit.< /text>

<text>I came in for a root canal 8/2007. Before the Dr' started the procedure. He told me to signal to him if it was too painful and he would stop and numb me some more, however once he started the pain was excruciating, tears were running down my face I asked the Dr to stop but he just continued and kept saying "we are almost done one more minute" with out numbing me some more. After the procedure  was over. All I could do is sit in my car in the parking lot and shake uncontrollable with tears running down my face. It took 6 years and having several teeth being pulled before I was able to trust another Dentist to do a root canal on me. RUN NOT WALK AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! I wish I could give negative stars : -(< /text></record></dataset><record>

I have been in the office a total of 4 times now. Once for the initial exam, once for a consult with the endodontist and twice with the hygienist Ali. Great all four times. And even though deep cleanings can totally suck, the two sessions I had were way better and less painful with a topical anesthetic than any of the ones that I have had with a local. Everyone has been super nice and helpful.
I had been at the same dental group since 2006 but moved a bit too far away to continue to use them. The first dentist I went to after leaving the dental group was last year and he was so terrible I was nervous about going to another new place.  Thank goodness for the at RCDG or I would have likely stayed away from the dentist longer than I should have considering I need to be on perio maintenance.< /Review>

This Dental Group is a bunch of liars and crooks!!!!!! Know your insurance deductibles and copays before EVER stepping foot in there because they are liars and will charge you whatever they can to get money from you! If they setup a payment plan for you make sure it is the correct amount because they will change that amount and overdraft your account!!!!!! They will also NOT work with you if you have a financial hardship!!!!! They will tell you too bad we will do it anyways!!!!!! This is the WORST dental office EVER!!!!!!!! DO NOT GO THERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!!! They do not care about the patient, only about their money!!!!!!< /Review>

Now I understand why this place wasn't given enough stars. I looked at the reviews, but still since it was close to my house and they took my dental ins, I decided to give them a chance.  The doctor was good, but next time I called with emergency they didn't have time for me. One time they scheduled an appointment but when I showed up, I was not in the system for an appointment. The doctor that I saw was very nice, but then she is no longer working there. I am not going back there, I gave them many chances.

I don't recommend this place.< /text>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I spent almost $2,000.00 on a root canal and crown. Okay, that's normal. Two years later the crown came off. When I went in to have it put back in, instead off "sorry about that, we'll take care of it", what I got was that will be $200.00, because you need an exam to determine why it came out. Really, it came out because you didn't do a good job the first time. I bought some crown cement on line and took care of it myself. This place is all about the money.</text>< Pics>

I went for a cleaning, i was at there office for an hour and a half the woman who took the x-rays was very unprofessional and after the doctor tried to sell me thousands of dollars in dental work. I had to get back to work and i was actually sold on using their services however they never called to reschedule the cleaning I originally went there for. So instead of treating me for what I went to there office for they spent there time up-selling me. If they performed the service i requested and done a good job they would have had my business, if you do a good job that sells itself. Adopt this business model and maybe the  feeling of discontent with the staff and the general unpleasant atmosphere may change. STAY AWAY!<//review>

I've called several times for an appointment as the wire in one of my brackets has popped off. It is causing me pain, and the appointing staff simply doesn't care. Not only this, but when I was in the office last (what I assume to be) an office manager was verbally abusive to the staff. Calling her associates stupid and simple minded. My dentist and orthodontist are very nice, but the office staff is unfit for the position. I've had to wait over half an hour for appointments before after showing up 20/30 minutes early. Additionally, getting someone on the phone is near impossible. I sincerely hope they read the reviews left here and improve the customer service.<//Text>

I am a new patient looking for a new dentist to replace a dentist who I have been serviced since childhood. This means I am observant to find a location that will do the job right to keep me loyal.
After meeting my dentist for the first time and small talk, I sat 30 mins waiting for a technician to set up the tools for the cleaning/examination procedure. Were they busy? Perhaps. The techs were busy talking to each other and other customers. The dentist did asked for the task to be done, but the task still took time to be completed from when the techs actually stopped their conversation.
The dentist didn't even provided me the opportunity to get an evaluation for braces, but simply said that my evaluation will probably be the same from my previous dentist (an evaluation from 10 years ago). This dentist, Dr. Yun Oh, is kind, polite, but does not give satisfying customer service for a new patient. He did not tell me that all of the documents I signed will be provided to me via print or email. As a matter of fact, I did not receive any copies in any form.
After examination with the dentist, my cleaning appointment was to be completed by a hygienist named DeeDee. The dentist didn’t even introduced her. I found out her name after she was done with me. She was not attentive. No scaling was done. She did not serviced a thorough polishing (i.e. tool kept on hitting my other teeth [not being polished]) nor was even competent enough to do a thorough rinse. She then continued to  complete the fluoride varnish on top of teeth that are not even cleaned from the polishing paste. I left with my mouth feeling disgusting and grainy. I had to rinse and brush my teeth at home after a visit from the dentist.
When it was time to pay for the bills, I got an email to instruct me to pay for the bills online. The bill was incorrect because it did not factor in the total bill after insurance was factored in. I had to go to the clinic in person to pay for the bill, which happens to be the correct amount. No explanation was given to prove why there was a bill discrepancy between the website and in house. Btw, I completed the survey only to have it tell me that there was an error at the end and to fill it out again-only to forward me to their website home page.
This location is loaded with new technology, instrumentation, and younger folks (millennials). I am a millennial and I must say this location will not get my business nor recommendations. Terrible service and quality. There was not enough leading nor authority. I will be canceling my next check up and looking for another dentistry group.<//Text>

<Text>My first visit was with my daughter, the assistant took her time to explain what they were going to be doing - xray and pictures (I thought she was super sweet), then they moved into her routine check up and had pulled a baby tooth that was preventing an adult tooth to come in straight.
Then it my turn,   I havent been to a dentist for a routine check up in over 10 years, (except year ago when I had to go to another dentist across the street from RC Dental on an emergency root canal.  They wanted to do several root canals) so I was already prepared to hear RC Dental, say hey you need 5 root canals, two extractions, and deep cleaning.  That wasn't the case at RC Dental.  What I ended up needing is a deep cleaning,  replacement filling, and a replacement crown.
I give them a 4 stars because I have only been there 3 times, and I HATE going to the dentist.</Text>< Date>

I would honestly rate this place an 0 if I could. I was a patient for a few months and was grossly overcharged even with my contracted insurance (I will be filing a grievance against them). The front office staff are nice but completely incompetent, between them setting up my financial dental account with a completely wrong SSN and losing paperwork I have had enough. Avoid this place at all costs, there are plenty qualified dentist in the area.< /text>

I was disappointed at first because a machine broke and they had to reschedule my appointment for later in the afternoon. When we were checking out at 530pm people were STILL coming in the door. I asked what time they closed and they were open that night until everyone was seen because they had so many issues in the morning. I have NEVER heard of a dentist office being so reasonable. They took time out of their lives to stay late and make sure everyone was taken care of!!!</Review>< pictures>

Called to schedule an appointment to get a tooth extracted due to it being broke and causing pain, told me the earliest then can schedule me is a month from now? What if it were infected? Place is a joke and they tried charging me for several items and upgrades my insurance didnt cover previously. This place needs to be reported<//Review>

Poor service. No one checked on my son after he had all four wisdom teeth extracted.  We could not get a call back when he was in severe pain and no one ever followed up with us after the procedure at all.  We couldn't get anyone to tell us how much out of pocket it would cost us until the day before the procedure.  It was the worst care and service we have experienced.<//Review>

<Date>1444869832903< /Date><review>Are they writing their own reviews? The front desk is broken. The Dentist is just as much a bully as the pencil thin receptionist that motions “talk to the hand” I was given someones denture with a mouth 1/3 larger and they tried to convince me it was mine and when they found mine the back teeth were too long causing damage to my bridge.  To top it off I went to have my teeth cleaned and got an infection and no one cared.  I went into the office many times and was ignored or called and left on hold.
I am afraid of loosing my jaw teeth and the doctor can not see me for days with this infection going on for almost a month.  They pick their help for their dress size and not brain cells.
When a paitent tells you they have an infection after a cleaning and no other work can be done until the absus is fixed you are put on a do not call list.  They are even trying to fight giving me my records.</review>< Pictures>

I haven't had a toothache since 1985 and this time I was in a great deal of pain. I saw a Dr Jun who was new to me, my regular dr moved. He took little interest in my pain and basically said he saw nothing and sent me home. A few days later I called to say I was still in pain. I was prescribed motrin 800 and an  antibiotic. Why an antibiotic when you didn't see me but anyway...I had to be seen again and saw Dr Oh. He was awesome... genuinely concerned and explained a lot to me. I went back for a follow up with Dr Jun and in the waiting room he recommended I see Dr Oh since I saw him before. I felt like they should've called me prior to taking the time off work. He then comes into an exam room and tells me again I need all this expensive dental work and refused to do a regular cleaning but insisted on me having a deep cleaning which is painfully expensive and a root canal saying I have an infection after 2 courses of antibiotics. The receptionist Heather seems bothered when you talk to her and has this issue with rolling her eyes back in her head while you're speaking to her. When I went for my appt she called me to her desk and not even a good morning or hello did she utter. She simply started talking. Rebecca is very polite!!! The assistant who worked with Dr Oh was awesome and the one with Dr Jun my first time was awful, and rough... she didn't even speak. I know they won't miss my business but I won't go back there.

They referred me to an endodontist and when I called them to cancel my appt, the voice mail was full!!!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809add6b12c6449b:0x1ef0c4f2d253f0e7</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My last dentist retired and none of the old staff remains in the office. Then I found out they wouldn't accept my new HMO dental insurance, I had to find another office. I picked RCDG&O because it was close to my house. The second I walked into the office, I was surprised by the welcoming size of the reception room and tons of seating. Everyone that I encountered during my appointment was friendly, knowledgeable, professional and super efficient. No time was wasted. I was extremely pleased with the modern equipment and treatment options. Thanks to Dr. Khan, I love the new Cerec crown I got. I didn't realize Cerec existed until my visit. Two hours for a permanent crown without a temporary crown and no revisits. I even saw the machine creating someone else's crown. Amazing, modern technology. I'm glad I chose Rancho Cordova Dental Group and Orthodontics for my dental care. It's a load off my mind knowing I don't have to look any further. My next appointment is already scheduled!</text>

Horrible place.  Never billed my ins and charged me full price up front.  Ins co. Did return some of my money after i reported it to them (i had an hmo)   botched a root canal costing me 1000's of $ as i had to have an inplant done and bone graphed due to bone loss,  took them to better business bureau, they refused to cooperation and instead lied and said they sent me a refund which they never did.  Don't go there.<//review>

Went in for a first visit, was not found in the system my dentist was more than 30 minutes late so had to leave for work. Dental assistants seemed nice but didnt know if i needed xray or not after placing me in the x-ray chair. Which in the end they were told NOT to do xrays? Receptionist's seem stuffy and very unfriendly. office looked clean but had a sort of dead silent feeling. Dont think i will return.

UPDATE: My daughter just went in for a filling and is now having more pain than before they ever touched her tooth. They are trying to gauge her with a huge treatment plan, when originally they told her all she needed was 4 fillings!!! They are crooks!! And apparently they do this ALL the time with new patients......Stay away from this shady place! Go to a professional dental office!!!!!< /Text>

<text>Overall experience is good, but..!
I'm 24 yrs old and this is the first time i'm visiting a dentist.
My appointment is at 3.00 pm(thursday) and i checked-in, filled the forms and submit my insurance at 2.35 and the X-ray started at 2.55pm itself.
My UHC soft dental plan covered basic cleaning, X-Rays and stuff.
after cleaning i complained about the hole in top-left-wisdom tooth, Dr.Khan suggested me to get it pulled out instead of investing my money on filling and crowns etc.(which is a good idea though).
they charged me 98$ for pulling it out, and suggested to have a surgery for my other 4 wisdom tooth(but i'm not going to spend money here(in USA)-i'll have it done when i visit my country(India)-its relatively cheap).
and the total bill is 123$ i forgot what is that extra 25$.
at that time due to anesthesia i didn't concentrate on anything else.

because of tooth extraction,for the first two days, i didn't anything. i'm afraid i'll get cavities, so, i consume only soup for lunch and frozen yogurt for dinner. and a small piece of bread for breakfast. because of not eating and got cleaned, my tooth became so sensitive, even water at room temperature shows effect.
and the socket from the extraction still bleeds after 2 days. as weekend came i couldn't call the clinic. i'll wait till monday and call the clinic.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Paid over 2K for a bridge, got home and found out that the color is ashy white and it's not matching the rest of my teeth at all !! I looked at it while at their office but didn't noticed this.
So sad and disappointed That "my" dentist would NOT tell me that the color is not matching my teeth at ALL!! Not like he didn't noticed this !!
Not going back There !!!</Review>

This is a great little park for toddlers, preschoolers, and maybe up to about 7 for the play equipment. It only has the toddler swings though, but the rest would be fun for younger kids. It's hard to find a safe place for the little kids because most parks are designed for older kids. This is the perfect one just for those little ones! There are 2 basketball half courts for older kids and adults. Plenty of tables in the shade by the play equipment for a birthday party or lunch at the park. There is also a small parking lot to park in. The hours are 5am to 1030pm. They have park lights, but I'm not sure how well it would light up the park after dark.</Review>

This park basically sucks. Not for children for the most part. There's always cigarette butts in the play ground. The dirt that the benches are in have broken glass everywhere. The city workers come but do nothing. There's no clean up.

80% of the time I walk with my kids there, there's some teenage kids smoking weed. You can smell it. They do it with no shame and no concern for the kids in the area. I've called the cops many times and I would encourage others to do the same. This place is for the children. Not the dumbasses.

There's no bathrooms here. So if you do go, make sure your kids "go", before you leave

I will be back only because I believe the park is for children and it's up to us as parents to make a difference.<//review>

<Review>I am very pleased to say they were very understanding when I finally got my refund. The women whom I had called after numerous times of being told I couldn't get refund, but once she told me to come in and get it I was well very thankful. I would go anywhere on the Greyhound.
Thank you To the bus terminal in Arcata Ca. For your understanding. ❤<//Review>< userid>

Most of the staff is rude to the local youth and anyone who is seen as a nuisance, eg hosing the cement when it's raining and ordering the hippie population to get out of the way.<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) My bus was canceled and we were not notified of anything, consequently I missed an international flight, nothing to trust this bus company be careful because to everyone I was asking they told me that it was something totally normal in this station

<review>Service was a bit slow. They were kind of busy in their defense. Food was quick once we placed our orders. Live music. Jukebox. Alcohol. Kid friendly. Indoor and outdoor dining. Full bar. 3 bathrooms. Food was ok for me, a bit dry and overcooked. Handmade corn tortillas are a plus. Will have to try more food to see if it was maybe just a bad day for the cook.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN98L5lQ4WK_-Q5D3chG6o6ZrAOjtVnquzkIZv2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlZx2KNOwvXtzEfkv6VmKUb6HdRW-SPJgwTfaE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxj-FgS0VemGU6Xpr2-ZHSaka6hTo6yi98Kt0r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW4LnT_-W3YstBH59xCHCtd1ygacq0mign0kSz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPGcLa5LzyMjV03DGdotxBJddrZsVBfMcBaJqyR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgormlXGCzxrye2a4P7GSkLXBDFOx8hTQvT2Jm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqo1iu50nt_LWvA8fXtTiAW6UjT4EUlbOJfefL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGbX-H41vW1pcMl-7Z-Ai4r-469bSUmEkyl3VB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWeLo7M1LpfHcMNTv13JuCY2yMUmF6taDoxmrM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPllskCqLby5KmgaC3lMZm23l9Z7n_sVu6CLom3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPbh0suPBicYl0Cz9LFxb91Gx6pBDPirR0Otbr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHq2PWOVyKoE__v1JiR2DTOWYhprCOl0eiZ5-G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWRuYlArehZDDDM1_iwy93dEgDC3iAF7HWGgPu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPD11Jie5ZAlpmweGPLwvHjZCaAtEOZ-i1XyOyq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnqKOhnX2-QEdH6HGQv3mukj8NbG4NgdKJLlS5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMLSBt7bzmX653U45WyV1_GEQujFS4Q6LXFMXV3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0inYaLZcCIv868-TyOze2yNUZTTcmOJeAflEW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMl2LfwNSc_yxWBi4tLz0uQ3I2JbEybdPh90WBA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVxTHymchLF60E6OFtCrkU5fZsz3hCEzTEPXdU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOK0Hu1UjqP6bqhMRx_R_-JnORpLHIqkg1fYFJ9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmZnwdTsT30-ojtVcMshVxzuqjDZTVf05jTUnl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkxcL-MYG0hgOMX07U9XIR3wzUmC3GzEYgy488=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPz1jl8OyNUky8-2WedoREbGdbDKNgHI6sO_xnP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9VOKmhixIjCxOBG6ACOMGGUSmgTysfSZUQ8dZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNNm5BvrRDcydtCguwRj52F1P_iJsehtO6nkpD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKI6PFtBFitf8ZERN9wt72ar_4Htwbk81Q8nNV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9JidQw1QGKUnmKZG_CM8fNigXAOX-cnhP783h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

The service was great. The servers and busser are on top of their game. Unfortunately, I feel that the overall cleanliness can improve. The dishes look scratched and as a result of the scratches old sediments of food yellow the dish. It smells humid and dirty inside not just food. The quality of the food is fair.<//Text>

No drinks or chips and salsa.

<review>This restaurant is a diamond in the rough. Never did I think when I stumbled into this place that I would find such an excellent dining experience. I value Mexican and Mexican-American cuisine above all others. The center of my business is in Santa Ana California which has no dearth of delicious food in Taquerias and restaurants. But Mariscos Ixtapa exceeded all of my expectations and was equal to all of my favorites in Orange County. The ambience is not over the top and comfortable. The wait staff are knowledgeable, charming and friendly. The bar serves a Manhattan, straight up, as well as a wonderful Margarita. But the food — the food is exquisite!!  I don’t know when I’ll be back but when I am in Perris, I will certainly be found at Mariscos Ixtapa restaurant!!!</review>< pics>

My family and I decide to try this place for the signature Mitchalada's and also the awesome chips with warm spicy been dip and salsa! The bean dip was on point!! It was a little bit on the spicy side though.
At least for me was. My husband and daughter loved it and thought the spice level was good. My husband and daughter ordered the fajitas and they were some of the best fajitas we have ever had!! They were season to perfection!!
I ordered the shrimp cocktail warmed with extra avocado and it was delish! 🤗 All of the food was great tasting & the service was excellent!! They even had a live band!! Great authentic Mexican food!! We will be back!</Text>

This place is amazing!!! The variety of seafood is insane. I had the camarones a la diabla and it was delicious! Our waitress was really nice. We went in for my soon to be brother in laws birthday and she was super nice. They had a live band and they even sang "Las Mañanitas" to him which made our trip even better. This was my first time going in to eat hear and most definitely wont be my last. Thanks guys@</Text>

0 star don't go ... Terrible service, he has no security, they say it is a family restaurant but he has no one to take care, of when he is a pure puppet boy who likes to get super drunk and with who knows what else.< /Review>

Horrible service . Went on a Sunday night it was not busy at all. We sat ourselves 20 minutes later they bring chips and take our drink order . I said we were ready to order our food. They said we had to wait. So 20 minutes later they bring our now hot drinks. We order our food and get it 30 minutes later the food was disgusting no flavor. We didn't eat our food asked for our check and they took another 15 minutes just to get our check . do not come here the service and food are horrible.< /Text>

We just left this place, and there was bad customer service. I’ve heard good things about this place, so we went. The guy said he was going to seat us, and instead he sat three parties that were in front of us. The guy had forgotten that he took my name. Then, we just waited, so we left. I’ll give it another try.< /text>

<Review>I have been here so many times this is my favorite restaurant and I’m so upset with the service and quality of food I went to place and order for pick up place an order the waiter told me it would be 35 to 40 min I came back to pick up my order at 40 min still wasent ready when asked they said they are still working on it took them an hour and 20 till my food was ready when I got my food it looked like they just threw everything in the containers and closed the top the salsa was all over with out a lid I have never experienced anything like this no excuse there was not that many people there so there was no rush I was still patient and waited that long... I’m so upset I hope next time I go I won’t experience anything like this<//Review><response>None<//response><rating>1< /rating>< Name>

Went to this location to have a dinner date the place was located in a very the discret and lonely location in perris close to the 215 freeway from outside it looks very simple with a very bright outside sign flashing multi colors once inside the restaurant looks much larger with clean seating clean tables and very attentive staff the bar is large and the dining areas large keep in mind there is a machine for the music however the music is largely all   Major mexicsn music largely serving seafood I ordered the fajita shrimps and my date ordered the oysters I was surprised with the homemade beans and home made for Tortillas as they served it was a delight I will visit this location again due to the quality of food being very high</text>

The food was good! Definitely would go back. The atmosphere is good there was live music. A little on the loud side. You can’t really have a conversation unless you want to be up in the persons ear. But over all the food and service was great.<//Review>

I go to this unique place every couple of days since I love the good mood that is exist in this place. The personel is extremely attentive and professional. The service is very rapid. Needless to say, the food they prepare is good. I came many times and I was never disappointed. The rate is fair. I highly suggest this restaurant to to everybody.</Review>

Really good, was way more affordable than I thought and the quality was really good. The menu has a lot to offer and a lot of pictures to show what you are ordering. The waitress was patient and polite. My new marisco place.<//review>

<Review>Food is very good. Tortillas are bomb and freshly made. Heard they have live music on the weekends. Only downside was there was no music playing. I went on a Tuesday night and we had to pay $1 a song off the jukebox.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I've been here a few times and I must say the food is really good. however it seems like you have to flag down your waitress for her to come and acknowledge you. The service was very slow.</Text>

Execelent food.. great music...we went on MOTHER's DAY we thought it was going to take for ever to get in because they were super busy but NOT after 15 min we got call in n the waitress was super friendly u can tell when employees enjoy their job because a smile is always on her face!!!! We order vuelve a la vida my wife n i ...my 2 teens order enchiladas n sushi the other one n they were super happy w that meal. ...we were on a single table..... I think if the sealing were painted on white instead of black it will make the place look taller i thinks so but other than that excellent place food n drinks!!!!👏👏👏👏👏<//text>

<Date>1574633914057< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><review>The first thing I noticed were the windows were covered, making the inside dark and dingy. Next , the menu's were laminated, waxie, and sticky. Opening the menu I was overwhelmed with all the different types of food they serve. In most cases, it's a good thing to have options, but when your understaffed and selling an array of dishes, the cooks are forced to cut corners. The seats and tables looked like they haven't been cleaned in a long time, and it showed. It's definitely not a family environment and kids should be kept far away from this place. Having a live band is nice, but not when they raise the volume so high you can't hear your own thoughts. The condiments seemed to have been kept at room temperature. The carne asada tacos were over seasoned and were comprised mostly of fat. The ridiculous price my family paid for the food is a crime against all Hispanics!< /review>< Pics>

<time>1571546718961</time><Rate>1</Rate><Text>Bad service today, I have been here before and have never experienced service as I did today. I ordered a Drink it was to strong and I asked to have something else. Waiter come back saying Manager said I can have something else but I would still need to pay for the one I didnt like nor drink. Due to waiter manager said that they can not give my drink to anyone else now. I asked to speak to manager manager basically told me that I can have something else but the drink that i did not like i would still have to pay for. He was rude, and said since they made the drink he will not take it off my bill. He said he would make me another drink less stronger and the one he brought me back was all syrup. Its like they just gave me a cup of syrup and ice. Of course I did not drink it. My husband still paid for it. But a good Manager or owner would at least apologize and say lets make you something different. It was not that I didnt want to pay, but I just wanted something I liked. This manager was rude, should not even be a manager. I was very upset no restaurant that I have been to has ever told me that they could not give me something different and would still need to pay for the drink I ordered.
Then the manager actually said to me well if you are going to be upset and act the way you are acting. I can act that way to. The only reason why I am upset cause of you Elias (Manager). You do not know how to be a manager and make your customers happy.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>Food is good, problem is that most of the time when our plates arrive they are cold waiters will take a bit to long to come back with refills. Even when not busy they take forever. No team work with the waiters. Again food is good but the service could be a whole lot better.<//text>< Pictures>

<name>Brett C< /name><text>Stopped in the night before Thanksgiving, service was good. Chicken taquitos were flavorful and I really enjoyed the rice and beans. The carne asada was a bit bland for my taste. I found it a bit absurd to be asked to post a Yelp review before I could get the 10% off for Yelp check-in, but such is life I suppose. Things like that are why their average rating isn't higher though, to be clear.< /text></record>

<text>I used to love it here ...
But food quality is very poor now!
The seafood mix tostada is not fresh at all. It seems like it's been sitting in the kitchen for a while and he micheladas are not as good anymore 🤷
I hope they step their game back up meanwhile I won't be coming back.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Placed an order to go. The ladies were friendly and attended me right away. Wait time for order wasn't too bad. As for the food, it was great. I had the asada, chicken, and pobre tacos. The salsas have an awesome taste, specially the red with a good kick of spiciness.< /review>

<Review>New to the area and just needed a place to enjoy some fresh mariscos. Came on Yelp and this was one that caught our eye, gotta say they didn’t disappoint. The green chili sauce that goes with the empanadas is delicious👌🏼the michelada mix can use a little more limes but overall tasty. My husband ordered aguachiles and those where really good but you must order a side of mayo to really get the whole combination explosion in your mouth. The aguachiles can use less of the salsa maggi y les quedarían fregones. I will definitely be coming back!</Review>< rate>

<text>I have been coming here since this restaurant opened and the service and food has only gotton better until today. I asked for iced tea and did not like the taste even after sweetening it, so I asked if I could change my drink and they said no. They no longer allow swapping drinks just because you don’t like it. Now I am stuck paying for a drink I didn’t drink and didn’t like. Nevertheless our waiter was kind and friendly passing the information from the manager. Although I have to admit this has disappointed me, my mom and sister who had joined me for breakfast today.<//text>< Date>

I live in Murrieta and there is no seafood restaurant that can compare to Ixtapa. My family and I love this restaurant and they trip is totally worth it. The food is extremely delicious and their drinks too. They offer a variety of seafood and alcoholic beverages.👍😋</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><text>3rd time I've been here. I can't speak for all the menu items but the chicken sopes are tasty. Just make sure you ask for whatever you want. If it's not included in the menu don't be afraid to ask. More than likely, it's available. For example, burritos are served but they are not listed on the menu. Check out the place if you're in town.</text>< pics>

<text>Service was ok, received the tortillas late when I  was almost done with my food. I ordered a original cantarito drink, that was a mistake, the drink tasted terrible. The surf and turf molcajete was almost all turf. With nopales and carne asada. Portions were adequate. My wife ordered camarones a la diabla. That dish was perfect and tasted geat. Price a little on the high side.</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Great food live music is great. But make sure when you get here ask who is Claudia which is a waitress and make sure she's not your waitress. Not to be mean but she's bad. The waitress for the  table next to us came to the table 8 times before Claudia came to ours. My wife was done eating when Claudia finally decided to bring her tostada's for her meal. And it's not the first time we come here often and Everytime she's our waitress we leave disappointed</Review>< user>

reason why it’s three stars only because from the time we got there until we got our food was about 45 mins total 10-15 min wait and you can figure out the rest . but food quality and presentation was definitely great !! i not downside is alcohol prices are a bit tad high but then again it’s not really a bar bar can’t expect much 💯💯💯<//Review>

<review>Food was good service not to good, the waitress forgot to bring a beer for 30 minutes we ended up asking another waitress for it even to get the bill it took forever, went to the bar got a first drink right away but after sitting there for about 45 minutes not one person asked if we wanted another drink.......I did notice that groups of men or just men alone get exceptional service go figure<//review></record>

The only good outcome was a man with a horse showing up at the front door step, without horseshoes which nearly lead him to slam into the glass walls of the restaurant. Police had to be called. Over an hour wait to receive our COLD food, overpriced and humid hot, with ceiling fans on the slowest speed. Staff friendly but clueless. People are pleased with this restaurant, but our family had the worst experience.< /text>

My wife order a pineapple drink that took for ever to get and once brought out to her it was hot didnt taste to good we had to order ice to have it cold. We both order tostadas de camaron and took about 45 mins to get 3 tostdas when we got the tostadas the shrimp was so raw it was gooie slimy and disgusting it tasted like it was straight out the ocean super beach salty. We asked that we no longer wanted the food and was told by the manager we had no choice but to pay for it. I don’t recommend anyone spending ther time here let alone money. I don’t recommend this place to anyone worst experience ever i think i got food poisoning from the one bite i had.

Overall two hours of a wait. Place is crowded, the staff dont have communication what so ever. It's ridiculous. It may be our fault for waiting but we were about to leave when they said our food was coming. There are many restaurants that are better than this one.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Terrible service. You will wait over 30 for someone to take a drink order. Manager and hostess will just look at you and do nothing.
Will never go back<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The worst service one can ask for. And the owner? Even worse. Egg people want to put where it does not fit. Rascón does not have, what he wants is one's money. The customer who strips it.

(Original)
El peor servicio que puede pedir uno. Y el dueño? Todavía más peor. A huevo quieren poner la gente donde no cabe. Rascón no tiene, lo que quiere es el dinero de uno. El cliente que se la pele.</review>

(Translated by Google) An excellent place to take the family. And the staff very attentive. (The waitress / bartender) very kind her name Nelly that in spite of being so busy attending so many clients (mothers' day) attended us as if we had been the only ones and so with each one of her clients. Reasonable prices and food very good taste.

<Text>(Translated by Google) We were 25 minutes in this restaurant, and no water binieron to offer us. We left there and did not notice. We are very hungry. They lost us as customers. They do not deserve a star from me; but I had to give them one to write my opinion.
We came from Hemet because we moved from here. From now on I do not recommend this place. They should take more care of their customers.

(Translated by Google) Delicious!! Just a little disappointed with the fish strips, very different from those in Ziguatanejo. But rich !! Besides being very noisy, you cannot hear the conversation due to the high volume of the music, but other than that, very good!

<Text>(Translated by Google) The food is not very good, my children did not even eat the chicken nuggets they ordered, by the time the potatoes arrived they were already very cold and the taste of the chicken as if they were made of cardboard! I ordered green enchiladas and after 35 minutes I finally got my order but wrong, the red enchiladas ... Besides all, it takes a long time to serve the food ... there are waitresses but they are all going around so it is easy to forget about your table, in that there is a lack of control! The only good thing is the mariachi :) Therefore, I do not go to that place!

(Original)
La comida no esta muy buena, mis niños nisiquiera se comieros los chicken nuggets que ordenaron, para cuando se los llebaron las papas ya estaban bien frias y el sabor de el pollo como si lo ubieran echo de carton! Yo ordene enchiladas verdes y despues de 35minutos porfin llego mi orden pero equibocada, las enchiladas rrojas... Ademas de todo Se tardan muchisimo para servir la comida...hay barias meseras pero todas andan entodos lados asi que es facil que se olviden de tu mesa, en eso ahy un descontrol fal !!  Lo unico bieno es el mariachi :) Por ende, Yo No buelbo a ese lugar!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dca1d5b6068779:0x474e5b71adab295c< /GmapID></record>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is a place more to get drunk, than to eat, and the waitresses do not dress according to a family restaurant.
