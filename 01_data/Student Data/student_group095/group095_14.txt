Best place for Napoleon! They have many yummy baked goods but the Napoleon is my most favorite. I've tried many places but this place has been the best by far. Pure deliciousness! The service is great too everyone is very nice.< /Text>

<Text>If you love strong coffee with milk this is the place to go. Way better coffee than Starbucks or coffee bean down the block from them. I can seriously drink there document cold brew everyday. You can pretty much say that's their signature  coffee that you won't find in another coffee shop. Definitely give this place a try their seating their lights everything about that place is amazing<//Text>< Rate>

<rating>5</rating><text>I write for a music and coffee blog called Crooners In Coffeeshops, in which I interview local musicians at local coffeeshops. My writeup reflects the positive experience that I encountered at Caffe Luxxe on our interview date.

L.A. based small batch coffee roaster Caffe Luxxe is wonderful example of what can grow from the powerful bond of friendship, specifically one that spans decades like that of owners Mark Wain and Gary Chau. Taking the chance to quit their corporate jobs in 2006, they’ve been able to fuel their business from their personal relationship and their love for European luxury caffe culture.

A fun fact, Caffe Luxxe is the first of its kind in L.A. for artisan coffee preparation, and boy golly, it is not one to miss at any of its So Cal locations. The coffee world is your oyster when picking your beverage of choice from their delectable menu of drips, pour overs, and a unique variety of Bevande Di Caffe (including a chocolate-y shaken Caffe Shakerato, a sparkling espresso Caffe Frizzante, and a spiced citrus Caffe Nico). If seasonal specials are your thing, have no fear, because they’ve got those covered too! What more could you ask for?</text>< pics>

I'm not a coffee connoisseur. But I know when it sucks. It took a while to realize how it could possibly be hard to make coffee that wasn't sour, bitter or burnt. You won't ever have these problems at Caffe Luxxe because they make consistent, high quality coffee that's smooth and doesn't need any extra sweetener. Just enjoy.< /Text>

This is my go-to coffee spot in the morning. The staff is super helpful and friendly and the atmosphere is usually very chill. The coffee is really tasty, the pastries are fresh every day, and the prices are fairly reasonable compared to the other chains in the area. Definitely cannot recommend Cafe Luxxe enough.< /text>

Pretty chill cafe tucked into a strip mall. I felt like it was a bit difficult to see from the street in light traffic but some of that is due to the rarity with which I am on that side of town. The employees were friendly and knowledgeable while the cafe itself was immaculately clean, well-laid out and inviting. The reason for my visit was specifically the espresso beans I had read about recently. They did not disappoint in the least, and pull a great shot after very little tweaking of my grinder. Any single point I listed would be enough to keep Caffe Luxxe in the rotation; the synergy of them all makes the drive somewhat more enjoyable.<//Text>

My wife found this place online and the reviews were great. We headed over here around 9am and walked into the drafty shop to see 3 workers chatting together behind the counter with not a customer in sight except us. They totally ignored us so we walked out and had delicious lattes + a fabulous breakfast at The Larder At Tavern just down the road. We won't be back!</Review></record>

They also have other tables but those have hard metal uncomfortable stools.

They need to work on their seating but the coffee is good!< /review>< Pictures>

Probably the beat coffee spot in Brentwood. I just wish they were open a bit longer!</Review>

<Text>Great tea but no Wi-Fi. This place is new clean friendly staff and clean bathrooms but they don't have internet access, which I don't feel is an unreasonable demand for a coffee shop.</Text>< pictures>

Cristian and Satu did a great job on our Minnie Winnie! The paint and gel coat was heavily oxidized and required machine cutting and polishing. They worked all day on it and truly brought back the shine on the paint and gel coat. They delivered as promised and we will definitely use JB Mobile Detailing on a regular basis!</Text>

Outstanding service, from the minute we made the appointment until they arrived we were updated on the schedule. Omar did such a great job that I feel we have a new car. Will definitely use them again in the future.< /Review>

I have used them multiple times once for ceramic coating and once for car detailing... in both instances, I have been suitably impressed by quality of work (they made my 6 yr SUV look new), professionalism of the owner and workers and punctuality.<//Text>

<text>Omar and his partner was excellent ! A text notification was a received a day prior to our appointment day. Another text was received when they were on their way with ETA. We had the mobile detailing at our residence.

Very professional yet courteous , and the auto detailing results on our SUV was outstanding , we were very satisfied . Toward the end , Omar also went the extra mile to get rid of some stubborn sanitizer stain on our dash and recommended shampooing our seats next time. We would definitely use Them again ! Request for Omar.</text></record></dataset><record>

Exceeded expectations! From the phone call with Jose to the work from Alonso. Everyone was very friendly and professional. They even fixed a few things in the car without me asking for it and outside of the planned job as complementary. It was completely worth it. Keep the good work!< /Review>

I was very impressed with the service, the guys were on time, checked in with me to see if I had any questions and best of all they came right to my house. The attention to detail was impressive, not your typical rinse, vacuum and go- we’ll definitely use them again and have recommended them to other friends and family!</review>

Just got my car hand washed by JB Mobile Detailing and I'm very happy with the result! They were very fast and *very* thorough (and this was on their base interior/exterior package). Also, it was great dealing with them since they communicate so well! I initially spoke to (and texted back/forth with) Jose to coordinate a bit since I have a difficult parking situation at my condo complex. They were very flexible and ultimately decided to just drive about 10min to their shop here in San Carlos to get it cleaned.  I made sure that they were aware that I had a PPF clear bra across the full front of the car and a ceramic coating, so they took care not only to ensure the edges weren't disturbed but they took the time to apply Ceramic Pro CARE to protect it afterwards (which is included, thankfully).< /text>

Not sure how this guy gets such great reviews...maybe the reviews are fake??  Booked an appointment for today at 2:40, paid the $125 online and they were a NO SHOW.  No emails, no call, no text--nothing! Will likely have to charge back the transaction since I am doubtful there is a phone number I can actually reach someone at.< /Text>

It feels so luxurious to have someone come to your home and completely detail your car, but that's what happens. At a price I consider competitive, they come and take care of everything so that you feel like you have a whole new car. Recommend!<//review>

The only issue was that in both cars, they seemed to scrub the etched plastic buttons a bit too hard, causing the etching to no longer be smooth. On the Start button on one, and the paddle shifters on the other, you can now "feel" where the print is on the buttons, when it used to be totally smooth. It feels like they scrubbed it down with a towel that snagged on the corners of the button, and pulled it up slightly. Minor, but annoying.</text>< Pics>

JB Mobile Detailing did a great job on my car. They started offering services at my work, and I was one of the first people to sign up. I got the full detailing treatment on my car and it looked brand new! A couple months later I got the $40 car wash service and it was just as good as the full detail. I'm sure there were differences but I couldn't tell what they were. They made my car look gorgeous. I have told anyone at work who would listen to use these guys and several people have, and they've all raved about it.< /review>

<review>My boyfriend spilled something in my car and I wanted the stain out asap. He was super friendly and was able to remove the stain within 15-20 mins! He was explaining what he was doing and the products he was using on my car before he did anything. Although it was my first time here, I'm definitely coming back here for any auto detailing in the future.</review>< Date>

Jose is very meticulous, and did such a stellar job, that I consider him my go to detailer.  Absolutely over the top job!!  Thanks Jose.....</text>< time>

Jose the owner and his employees are very efficient and friendly.  My car looked new once his workers finished with it last March and the interior stayed dust free for weeks afterwards. Each and every crevice was dirt free..  He even touched up the white spots and scratches on the exterior.  He did such a fantastic job that I just had my husband's car detailed today as an early Father's Day gift.  He couldn't fix the chipped paint (as he didn't have the paint which needs to be ordered) but told me exactly how to do it.  My husband's 17 year old Lexus looks new (except for the dents and paint chips!)  And added bonus is he comes to your home!
I will definitely call Jose again!< /Review>

Like the name says Old Fashion, but very good. The store front is your classic 70's all glass & not run down like other shopping centers. Plenty of parking although depending on how busy the cross streets are it may be a little difficult to make a left hand turn out of the parking lot.< /Review>

<Text>This place offers a great value for the money.  They sell solid doughnuts for a good price.  I recommend their creation they call the fruit roll up.  The apple cinnamon  tastes like a cross between an apple pie and a cinnamon roll.  They also sell canela or cinnamon tea.   I am not an early riser so I love that they still have a good selection later in the day.</Text>< userid>

<Review>Super yummy sandwiches so good i go out of my way to get them. Their donuts are fresh and yummy. Clean store with hand sanitizer avaliable.  Good coffee and friendly staff open 24 hours! A must stop if you want donuts or a yummy sandwich. Not super cheap but worth it!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Quality is top notch. At so many donut shops you get a bunch of different shaped donuts but they all taste the same. Old Fashioned Donuts is not like the rest. Cherry frosting taste like cherry, maple frosting a like maple, you get the idea. One of the best buttermilk and old fashioned around. But the true standout for me is the rainbow sprinkles donut holes. No matter what you order, don’t walk out with at least a couple dozen of these colorful little nuggets of flavor! Perfectly fried cake and the frosting and sprinkles layer is almost crunchy. They don’t skimp on the sprinkles either.<//review>

The coffee may not be "Dunkin' Donuts" great, but it is very good.  I've never had a better glazed buttermilk donut than the one from here.  Overall the place easily gets a solid "Very Good" rank from me!</review>< pictures>

I was close to being impressed with their Ham & Cheese Croissant.. until I found two very large (albeit fresh) whole jalapenos in there that were not requested nor particularly wanted that morning.
Also- if you need/want to pay with debit/credit card it costs $1.00!</review>

<review>Absolutely the WORST place to go to I ordered a breakfast sandwich and she  wrapped my sandwich individually one was fine and when I open the other one it was burned my husband went back to take it to exchange it and they would not even exchange it or give my money back I'm never going to come back here and I suggest you guys don't come here either. How do you expect to run a business when u make a mistake and can't own up to it!<//review>< pictures>

Donuts are very well made and tasty. The thing that bothers me is price that is charged NEVER matches the overhead board. Price quoted even changes daily...sometimes 2, 2.50, 175, etc. Other than that, no complaints. Fix that and it's 5 stars.</review>

I went to this place for a tire replacement, and they did but I discovered the following day that the tire specifications was the wrong one, so I went back looking to resolve the problem but the owner was not very helpful,  he told me that I was wasting his time. He wanted me to spend more money for a new tire.  If you have a choice please do not go to this place.  Terrible customer service,  and the job delivered was sloppy.  My new rims were all dirty and scraped.<//Review>

As a woman anytime you go to any automotive anything you feel like the man automatically assume you don’t know what you need you don’t know what you’re talking about and try to overprice you that did not happen in this situation and I’m thankful< /Text>< pics>

They were going to bill me a higher than usual price for a flat tire pucture plug, but they notified me that the puncture was too close to sidewall and offered me a replacement tire at a really decent price, given the condition. They even did balancing and install for me.< /Review>

<review>Women don't go there solo. They all talk at you at once i just needed a tire fixed they were the only place open ended up trying to do some shady business to get me out of money. Then when they didn't do what I asked they wanted to charge me to fix what they messed up. Better yet don't go there. It was my only option at the time.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Used tire shop with hundreds of tires.  I brought in brake pads and rotors and they got it done quick for a good cash price.  Recommend this place for sure</review>

These people are crooks! The guy told me it would be $60.00 to install my tires , after installing them he told me it’s $90.00 because he had to balance the tires and disposed of them.  I said ok whatever, then as I was driving on the freeway my steering wheel starts to shake really bad so I go to another tire shop and I was told the tires were never balanced they showed me the weights on the tires and they were my old ones and two of the tires didn’t even have weights on them.   Please do not ever go to this place !!!<//Text>

Abel is one of the most honest and down to earth mechanic’s I’ve meet. He went into detail on the work he did on my car. He also showed me the process which made me feel more comfortable about get my brakes done. If you need a good honest mechanic that works fast he’s your guy. My wait time was an hour for full brake pads and rotors!!!< /text>

Super fast service!!!
Just went inside to pay for the repair of my flat tired which had a big bolt inserted and when I came out they told me " you are good to go". I might spent 4-5 minutes completing the paying transaction and my van was ready to go.
They removed the bolt and fix my tire with out having me to wait at all!!
This is what I call " customer service'</review>

They have always been shady but i know enough about cars not to get ripped off. These guys don't double check to see of the lug nuts are tight. Their used tires are retreads which are illegal.

These people sell bad, used tires that fail quickly, (I don't know how they find so many poor tires to sell!)

Bought a set of pretty, 90<% tees life left used BF Goodrich, the employees were fairly unprofessional, especially the head honcho, and in a matter of months, two tires devoloped serious bubbles, I also know multiple people that bought used tires here & had them blow within a week.

STAY AWAY

If you want a good value & good products & good service, go to A1 of Monte Vista!<//review>

Don't buy tires here  they don't stand behind their products
Had to have my Alignment done twice now a third time because they didn't do it correct and tires all wore out just short of a year when I took it back the older guy I assume manager or owner said it due to my Alignment which I did  unwilling to make it right. But was quick to get 500 bucks from us<//Text>

Shady business full of people who want to rip you off. If I didn't know anything about cars I would have been overcharged 200+ for brake service. Tires here were a decent price but didn't last more than 2 months. My advice is to stay away from this place.<//text>

The scammers strike again.  Neighbor was charged $30 over the listed price and when she wouldn't pay, two of her tires 'mysteriously' went flat that night.  No, people who rate these people badly are not unhappy with everyone.<//review>

I have to retract my good review below.  They charged me for a full brake service but only resurfaced the rotors then put the old brake pads back on.   I had to have my brakes redone some where else.  Owner refused to refund any money.

"I actually am really happy with the service.  It's a regular corner dirty used tire shop but those are the best kind for deals...  "< /Review>

<Review>Can we do negative stars?! I’ve been here before. I was never very happy with the service or the vibe of this place. I don’t want to sound racist or anything but I shouldn’t feel like I’m in the Middle East with people talking in their language when I’m sitting there as a customer waiting for my car to get new tires put on. I normally call and get a quote, A couple of times before they have charged me more than what they quoted me, I just let it slide by, because sometimes you’ll get a good deal depending on the kind of tires you’re getting, but that’s not my issue, THIS is what motivated me to post a review: today I called and homeboy was super rude, i simply asked for a quote on new tires vs used, I was just trying to get a quote! Homeboy starts yelling at me?!?! if you’re too busy to just get me a quote no worries, you won’t get my dollars either 🤷🏽‍♂️< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80853d45f8314313:0x1478612cfb2aaf0d< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Needed a new valve stem on a 41" offroad tire on a Sunday and couldn't find anyone to do it.  Stopped by E-Z Tire Shop for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised.

DO NOT give these guys your hard earned money. I went in as a single woman to get my a/c done. They told me a few things were wrong w my car and they could fix it and put in a new thermostat for $370.
Not only did a mechanic friend later tell me they DID NOT replace any of the parts they said they would fix, but it appeared that they actually cut my radiator hose on purpose so I would come back with issues so they could get more money out of me!!!!!
What kind of business does that?!?!? To a single mom struggling?!?!?!? They should be shut down!!!!!!
Don't trust a word they say!!!!<//Review>

Asked them to change 2 tires that needed to be changed badly and they charged me for 2 used tires and only changed 1 . When I went back for them to fix it I brought my dad , they tried to say they had never seen me before and they diddnt know me, the guy that took my money the first day I think the owner told me he wasn’t working that day but I Recognized him clearly...my dad, he had them give me the tire I initially paid for that I never got and also replace the one they put on because it was so worn, so they gave me the worst tire they had. Then now months later now that I’m getting a alighnment I find out they put two different size tires on my car and now my axle can’t be alighned.. it’s cheap but it’s not worth it, they cause your car more trouble and you will just have to spend more money.< /review>

Ez tires has great deals and good service.
I believe that people who complain about the shop are people who are just unhappy about everything. This tire shop helps everyone stay on the road with prices and service that beats everyone in Vacaville.</Review>

This sotre is the worst in the history of ever . . .  I got a tire here because mine had a small leak. I got a tire from here and everything thing seemed fine until it completely deflated going 65 on the freeway. Oh did i mention this was only 10 mins and 2 niles down the road after i got the supposedly "new " tire. I dont know how they aren't out of business yet.....</Text>

< review>
My hondas alignment is ALL bad now. EnZ Tire Shop of Vacaville CA, is the Worst tire shop around. Do not go to them. They didn't even give me a receipt, and get away with their 'Long Term effect of car damages' to my Honda because I was of course, in a "rush rush gotta go to work" situation. Because of this I was sent back out into society, naive to any tire fundamentals, with a tire that was too BIG, thus resulting in massive wear & tear that surfaced at a shop I brought my car into, months later! The steering wheel was & is still all wobbly, loose veering without constant hands-on control, & my tires have inconsistent tread markings & baldness; making for a rough ride & a sensation of a possible Blowout DEATH ride. These jerks owe me a free alignment. Let ME be the one who sacrificed my soul so that YOU can be the one who saves yours, by NOT going to EnZ Tires on Aegean Way in VACAVILLE, CA!!! 1 Star!

They call me at 530 to tell me they ordered the wrong part and that it would be ready the next day sometime in the morning.  No call all day and now they say it wont be ready till 6pm so I have to take another day off from work. Never again.</review>< pictures>

Worst place in Vacaville I needed a new front tire so I went to these guys they said I needed  two new tires so I got new tires after a week the tires wouldn't hold air it had a slow leak they sold me a used tire so I went back then they charged me more for the next set of tires three days after my tire came off on the freeway coming home from work this time they put the screws on to tight so it stripped the screws and my tire came off  I will never go here again be very careful with these guys they didn't try to help at all and told me there's nothing they can do about my tire</Text>

Chicken was old.  Had to pile on the hot sauce to make it edible.  I ordered four pieces of chicken but they only gave me two. I had to drive back to the place to get them to correct the order. Telling me they were sorry didn’t make me feel any better with all the trouble and two pieces of old cold chicken</review>

That popular "chicken burger" was ok.  I had not tasted one, until today.  Why were people fighting over it?  Geeez.  Relax and get a life. It's nothing to write home about.  However, I did like the mashed potato. The service was very attentive and polite.  Yes, I'll be back, but only because I'm  in that immediate area.<//Text>

Love this place it’s way more better than the one near Solano Mall and is good as the Suisun and Vacaville location. Staff here are alright, chicken is always fresh and love the Spicy and Mild Flavors. Just be sure that you have everything that you’ve ordered completed before you leave and head home.< /review>

Food was fine although it was slow to get my food even though there was only one other car. Please train your workers to use covid safety procedures and wear their mask properly. For now I will get my food else where since other places that serve food make sure workers all fully masked not this nose hanging out stuff.<//Review>

We asked for extra sauce and ranch and they gave us 2 ketchups and a single BBQ sauce with no ranch. Hella stingy with the sauce. Why buy food here if you're just going to end up having to eat it plain???<//text>

<text>Carl's Jr has gotten way too expensive. Two guacamole bacon burger meals with large drinks will now set you back $36. Poki restaurant nearby will only cost you $22. Same thing with the nearby Mexican and Chinese restaurants.<//text>< Pics>

The cashiers work with acrylic nails done  & I find that unprofessional of their part. The manager whose name is Robert I believe, seems to be so unbothered when I pointed it out to him. But never again my bag was all ripped, no napkins. What a great customer service !</Text>

I haven't had any issues with the food. It seems like their systems are down pretty often, the employees do their best to manage regardless but management needs to care a bit more to keep things maintained.<//Text>

I recommend checking your order before you leave the parking lot, but this store is rarely busy so getting things corrected isn't usually a problem. The staff is very friendly, but they will getoverwhelmed if there's more than a couple cars in the Drive-Thru.< /review><Rating>4< /Rating>< Pictures>

One of my favorite bubble tea places in the city. Consistently great! Some bubble tea places can be hit or miss depending when you go. Qualitea lives up to its name.

Good, friendly service. They can be a bit slow, but it’s worth the wait! Always accommodating.< /Review>

friends and i got the rose petals, taro kisses, and house milk tea. all were soooo delicious & the boba was the perfect texture & sweetness! my personal favorite was the rose petals at 100% sweetness. the taro was also amazing & there were real pieces of taro inside too - not artificial tasting at all. love love love!!

workers were also very sweet & took safety measures seriously.

100/10!!!<//Text>

<review>Tasty taste classic milk tea. Flavorful and just enough sweetness for us at 50% and less ice. The boba there always have the right amount of sweetness and a good level of chewiness.  Love that it is close to the hood and they got games! Will be coming here more often.<//review>< pictures>

Nice, cozy place.  They keep social distancing. Can enjoy the tea outside only and they provide sanitizer.  Price is reasonable.  Too bad they don't have broader selections.</review>

I happened to be in the Castro District and suddenly had a craving for boba. I happened upon Qualitea and I couldn't have been happier with my drink and my experience.

I so happy to have found this tea shop and I can't wait to go back and try another drink.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrVQC4RVPBGO34Y9-1VxqaodonhmLwhevOQnq2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>I ordered a hot no sugar oolong milk tea with boba, costing me 5.25, which I considered expensive, but conceded is typical for that area. I could taste the oolong although it was not as strong as the drinks in Taiwan or Hong Kong. It was nicely hot, which I find is not the case in a number of places here where cold drinks are the norm. As the place was not busy, I had a seat to myself in the center table and enjoyed the quietness.< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO22Ukn2aX5hwLn8jyU1nqeEByvzcBQkEqpWR4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

Cozy spot with high quality fully customizable tea drinks. There are a few board games available to play, and one table with an outlet by it if you need to charge your phone or laptop. The drinks are as good or better than other boba places in the area and definitely cheaper.< /Review>

I am an AVID bubble tea drinker. I get it at least 2 times a week. I like to try out different places and I've gotta be honest , i didnt LOVE it here. I always get taro milk tea. It wasn't sweet, creamy, like usual, instead a VERY bland and watery. She remade it for me which I greatly appreciate and that makes me give it 3 stars instead of 2. Tha ambiance of the place is casual and clean, modern.<//Text>

I was enjoying a late Summer in SF with about 80-degree weather, so I went with the passion cooler, passion fruit green tea so thy citrus juice and mint, and I added jelly. They have me too much ice and too much sweet, given that I ordered little of each, but it was refreshing, although not much liquid after a tall thin cup with lots of ice. The menu has some good variety, but not a crazy menu, which is actually kind of nice. They have a chalk board with a few specials. I expect you’d find something like whatever you’re looking for in the boba department.

There’s a decent amount of seating, but not really enough to make it a sit and work kind of place, more of a sit with friends while drinking your bev kind of place. They have a couple of tables outside. The staff are friendly. It’s included in the Castro fest boundaries. I checked in on yelp for a free topping!<//Text>

My rose latte + tapioca bubble tea was really good for the 2-3 first sips. Then, it was awfull, tasting like a trully bad coffee. I don't know how that can happen and I am very disappointed.< /review>

I forget what business they replaced, but I think coffee shop. Bright place with boba industry setting. Seating is limited to a communal like table, but a few tables outside as well. The employees are cool, witty and outspoken. Took me about three minutes to decide what I want, but that's when they come through. Told them why I like and don't like, then they made suggestion. Drink is alright made to my specifications of no ice and low sugar. Boba were nice and chewy not to soft and holds shape of roundness. They were up front when asked if it was real taro pieces or powder. It was the latter, but at least I know ahead of time.<//text>

<rate>5</rate><text>The first Authentic Boba Shop in Castro Area.  The boba is so good and the sweetness level is exactly what I want ( you can choose the sweetness level) . All the specialty drinks are good also.  My friends tried the deluxe punch and rose petal.  They all love them. I can’t wait to go back and try the rest of the specialty drinks !!</text>< Pics>

I've tried their "Matcha Blossom" (which is essentially a matcha latte with strawberry puree) and I thought it was just ok.  It would have been nice if they had milk alternatives, which they didn't.  I haven't tried any of their other drinks, but I definitely would not go out of my way to come here.  This is a nice place to stop by for boba only if you are in the neighborhood.  Whats nice about this place is that they have some games for you to play if you're hanging out.</text>

Wow this place is amazing!  The service is top notch.  Qualitea is a tea shop specializing in boba tea.  They have some amazing speciality drinks like the Deluxe Punch and Matcha Blossom.  My favorite is the grapefruit drink that features fresh grapefruit and flavoring.</Text>

<Text>Genuine Boba tea focus, not gimmicky, in the Castro, block and a half off the Castro on 18th (formerly Phil's Coffee) and NOT next to corporate coffee.  Their milk tea is as good as this basic gets, and you get to tweek it to make it your own.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Text>I took my two frenchies to Essential grooming after always heading to chain pet stores for nail trims. It cost me nothing to upgrade to a spa package for them both the be bathed, nails, ears and anal glands done. The staff were wonderful and even spent time playing with toys with my two girls. They came home smelling absolutely amazing! It’s been a week and I swear they still smell so fresh! I will forever continue to go to essential grooming now!< /Text>< pics>

Essential grooming made my dogs first visit a great and easy one! I almost didn't recognize my dog when she came out! It was like the cowardly lion in wizard of oz coming out of the emerald city grooming salon! Definitely going back! Also the price was very good!<//Review>

This place is really super awesome the younger gal named cassie was fantastic. In telling you I really do not know how she managed to handle my four legged spoiled girl, especially considering cassie is a bit short.  I mean literally she is like 5ft nothing.  And my girl is very stubborn and can easily over power her. But nope she obeyed perfect and did every thing cassie told her todo. All I gotta say is WOW!!!<//Text>

This place is great. We have been going her for years ever since our dog was a puppy.  They had a groomer that was really good at calming our pup down cause he was really anxious when getting groomed.   When she retired they quickly we're able to find someone who could groom him no problem.  We even met a lady that drives Al the way from Arizona every few months to have her dogs groomed because she used to live here and her dogs love this place.</Text>

{'time': 1567613840605, 'text': "Hi Lisa, I'm sorry your experience was great. We work hard to give every customer our best and we are thankful when they take the time to provide feedback.\n\nI took a look at the time of your last visit and we had some employee turnover during that time. Our receptionist had moved on to a new opportunity and I was filling in for the role. This was unexpected and I was not well prepared as a new business owner. I'm sure your description is accurate, and that's on me.\n\nThe good news is that I have been replaced by someone much more qualified. 🙂 And we still have many of the employees that have provided, and continue to provide, great service and enjoy building relationships with our customers' pets.\n\nI hope you consider giving us another chance. We are committed to providing enjoyable and valuable services that help our customers care for their beloved pets. We will make mistakes, but we own up to those and make changes to improve.\n\nThanks again for your feedback."}<//Resp>

My oldest is 8 a hyper huskey and absolutely feels at home there. We just added another member to our family a chocolate lab and at 10 wks old we took him to get his first pedicure and introduce him to the family. He was instantly at home and can't wait to go back. Thank you ALL for being my family's extended family 💛<//Review>

Please let me know if there is anything we can do. Thanks'}</Resp><review>I took my 11 year old dog here last week. He sat down immediately after I got him outside. We had to carry him to the car. It was 3 days before he could walk again. I am so upset that they assured me his senior needs would be accommodated. Obviously his hips were stressed to the extreme in some or multiple manner(s). I saw pulling on the leash, he was kept in a cage to small for him. I never met the actual people who worked on my dog. I was told he has fleas over the phone and it was a $20 pill and an hour long additional wait Before starting to groom him.
I don’t believe that he ever had fleas he takes TriFexis  we have cats and they don’t have fleas there is no flea dirt on my dogs bed he does not scratch. We show no sign of fleas, we feel lied to.
Spent $165 and I never even met the groomers or was given a receipt.
I always went to Petco groomers before and I will return.< /review>< GmapID>

They do a super job on my Bogie.  They are always pleasant
They keep a record on the computer of "everything Bogie". He has allergies and I can be certain they are not giving him snacks he should not eat.  They do a great job and Bogie loves them.<//review>

The receptionist Jessica helped me on the first visit (more visits now) and also gave me more information on the membership pass, it so worth it! I had a great sessions with Dr. Pack and Dr. Nick, they helped adjustment my lower back and their advisory also helped me on new stretches work outs. The best chiropractor clinic I would recommend for anyone.< /Review>

<Review>Always clean, friendly staff, met the new Chiropractor today since i hadn't been back for a whole. Super friendly. Definitely gave me some tips for helping my back which is always great. Ended up getting a wellness plan to help. Its a great price too $79 a month includes 4 visits. Can't wait to get my back fixed.< /Review><user>100181418282524164014</user><Date>1612496869804< /Date>< username>

<review>I began seeing Dr. Nick back in August for severe back/leg pain. He has brought me nothing but relief, he always makes sure he takes in consideration all my concerns and works with me to improve my condition. I cannot thank him enough for bringing me so much relief into my daily life. I've needed so much care through these past months to overcome my pain and he has been there for me every step of the way. Also the receptionists are always incredibly friendly to me and every single customer that walks in. This location has an excellent team, I would highly recommend them to anyone that is in need of a chiropractor, Dr. Nick is the best!</review>< rate>

Dr. John is great. The entire staff is great. He has helped our entire family. My husband was not a chiropractor believer, but now he has a membership. It helps with our body aches thay we just ignore. We now come weekly  to help us stay adjusted and ready for our day to day.</text>

Do not go here. I signed up for their services and they cracked my back which took about 5 minutes to do and they put me on a monthly plan. Their contract is not fair at all. You have to cancel a month before or else they will charge you for the whole month. I did not go for 2 months but they still charge me $120. The management refused to give me a refund and they did not treat me nicely. Overall I'm very disappointed and I don't like to write negative reviews but because they treated me this way, I would say go somewhere else.<//text>

<text>I am receiving unsolicited text messages from them, I'm sure it's not hard to buy cell phone lists, we all have to make a living and I understand marketing. My complaint is the "Opt Out" feature, the text says type "STOP" so you don't receive further messages, I did and within 1 hour received 3 more messages. So if you are from the The Joint Chiropractic please fix this problem.< /text>< GmapID>

First time here. Food was ok. I ordered pho and my broth was not hot enough. Other members felt it was ok too.</review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>One of our favorite Pho stops. Pho Go always shocks me with the volume and selection of the meat they put in each bowl... And bowl sizes... Got the Panda size one time OMG talk about a trough of Pho! If you are looking for one of the best Pho locations in OC don't miss this place.

The service is friendly, the food is awesome... Come hungry!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQ7pMk88AGgQobZ7DnwcFEjEH3CIJDUVB9-FBY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Solid place for pho. Broth is flavorful and portions are gigantic even for a small bowl. I come here almost weekly and everyone recognizes us 😆. Their eggrolls are really good as an appetizer. I like to order small pho tai chin bo vien. Only problem is the parking but if you go during dinner times its pretty empty.<//review>< Pictures>

Sat outside today for dinner.  Assuming with the new spike of Covid 19 cases, making them change the seating up.  It was actually really nice ambiance to sit outside and have dinner.  Very hipster. I liked the change of pace.</text>

This place has the best pho and bun (rice bowls! One thing we really like is the non-greasy egg rolls they serve. Crispy and delicious! And VN food is gluten free!
Low carb tip: ask for rice vermicelli to be replaced with veggies. Super good.< /text>

No#1 pho in SoCal. Their selection of pho is amazing. Try any and you won't go wrong. We lived the egg rolls here as well.

PS
I always wondered why all restaurants gave only 2 lettuce to roll for 3 egg rolls? Never made sense, this was the first and only restaurant to date I visited that have 3 lettuce for 3</review>

My first time having lunch at this restaurant. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Very comfortable atmosphere. Very clean and neat. Food was served in a timely manner and was excellent. Like i said, it was my first time eating there. The manager went above and beyond to make my experience excellent. This will definitely be a weekly lunch place for me.< /Text>

<review>Our family of 5 went there yesterday around 10pm,  I ordered “Pho with chicken breast”  they ran out of chicken breast. I changed to Pho with chicken leg, they had no more. I had to switch to  “Bun” & they had enough Bun for only 1 order. And “Pho Go” was opened until 12am yesterday. They should close their restaurant earlier.
This is the second time. Last month, we came around 9pm and they’re out of chicken too. If they’re out of chicken they should post a notice on the front door  such as  “out of chicken breast/leg ” or  “ we have no more Bun”.
Yesterday will be our last visit.
Bye Bye Pho Go.<//review>< Pictures>

Surprisingly, a truly hidden gem that can rival other Pho shops with ease. The beef is tender and tasty, while the broth could use a little bit less anise. Although it has been opened for 2 years, it deserves a better acknowledgement.</Text>

My family came here for dinner. I love the Pho because the quality meat and clean broth.   The restaurant is super clean.  The pho is about 25 cent to 50 cent higher than other places. I think its what you pay for is what you get.  I am a huge fan of this place.</text>

The pho is good and service was good! Just be aware they ACCEPT CASH ONLY so that became an issue after we ate and only had a few bucks on us because we usually pay with card.</review>

<review>So-so pho. Open late and a giant panda bowl are the main claim to fame.

However, since open late is definitely worth a bit, I think 3* rather than 2* sounds right.< /review>< pictures>

Just a few minor suggestions on improving the quality of service is to have a napkin box at the table because God knows our sweat flows when eating these hot broth.< /text></record>

This place is defiantly legit.  The restaurant is clean.  Everything is new and including the bathroom.  This is the cleanest restaurant in town.   I love the Chicken Pho and the portion is huge.  Also they have USB charging plug on the wall.  I highly recommend.<//review>

I now stand corrected. Service is friendly and the lady working the counter has two jobs. I know this cause every time I have gone there she is in OR scrubs.

<review>I came to this place with my family.  It was way better than most pho restaurant in town. This restaurant is clean.  I ordered the Chicken pho. They brought the phone out with a side of chicken.  The portion was huge.  My husband order the beef  noodle soup and he really enjoyed.  I highly recommend this place.   Oh they have USB power plug on the walls.< /review><Time>1499034676148<//Time><UserId.>106056981580910786729</UserId.>< Rating>

This is my favorite pho place!  I’ve had others but this place has consistently fixed my pho craving. We also enjoy the tv broadcasts. Since we’re so much we barely get to see what’s going on in the world.</Text>

A solid bowl of pho here. I thought it was a little bland so not sure if it's just today or everyday but I'm kinda thinking its their style. Comes in 3 sizes: small, large, and panda (aka extra large!) The problem? The small is too damn small (my usual go to size at all pho places) but the large is too big!!! So I was still kinda hungry after the small....< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) The atmosphere was good and the interior of the restaurant was clean and the interior was not cramped. I enjoyed the pho tendons. All five family members ordered according to their taste. I enjoyed everything.
🥀 I can only pay in cash

(Original)
🦜분위기도 괜찮고 식당 내부가 깔끔하고 실내가 비좁지 않고 넓어서 좋았어요. 나는 pho tendons(소힘줄)가 맛있었다. ⚘다섯식구 모두가 각자의 취향에 따라 주문 했다.  모두 맛있게 먹었어요.
🥀 현금으로만 결제가 아쉽다<//review>< Pics>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Excellent food and service. An exquisite taste But you don't earn the 5 stars because they only accept cash payments. I think there should be open credit cards.

Excelente comida y servicio. Un sabor exquisito. Pero no se gana las 5 estrellas ya que únicamente aceptan pagos en efectivo. Creo que debería haber apertura a tarjetas de crédito.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>We chose this pediatricians office for our first newborn and had a great experience. We saw Dr. Howell, he was very kind and gentle and took time to ask if we had any questions or concerns. The front desk was very welcoming and understanding. We weren’t super early for our first appointment which was nerve racking at first knowing we had to fill out paperwork but everyone was very kind, helpful, and patient which made all the nerves for me and my husband go down! Overall great staff!<//text>< Pictures>

My daughter has been a patient for 16 years and always had a great experience until now. We really like Dr. Torgersson. Not sure what’s happened with the office staff. Hopefully that is sorted out soon.< /review>

<Review>The staff is very polite and understanding. I asked if I could have a few minutes to feed the baby before proceeding with the appointment and that was not an issue for them. The physician always welcomes any questions I have and provides clear answers.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<text>We have been coming to Elk Grove Pediatrics with Dr. Torgerson and Dr. Saied for about 15 years and we absolutely love them. All the staff is always so comforting and nice. Both doctors are amazing. I have even referred a few family and friends because of their amazing service.< /text>< user_id>

Elk Grove Pediatrics is NOT the same quality doctors office it once was. The support staff has completely changed. After a rather large mix-up in regards to a vaccine given to my daughter in October, and confusion as to which one was due because her record showed she had been given flu shot, which she happens to be allergic to, I have less than favorable opinion in regards to not only their organizational skills, but mostly their LACK of professionalism.  When nurse assistant called to let me know the mix up was straightened out and not to worry, I asked that her supervisor called and requested the documentation to reflect the corrected mistake. I was told no I could not have a copy of paperwork, and no one, not nurse or more importantly the doctor whom my daughter has seen since she was 5, qnow 14, didn't even have the kindness to call me to apologize or reassure me this mistake was simply a clerical error. I had truly thought she was a good doctor, who really had me fooled, as I thought lal these years she cared. Clearly the office has a total lack of organization, as well as complete lack of professionalism. You don't tell me my daughter is due for her 2nd HPV vaccine, when she supposedly had it 6 months prior. And then tell me she had the flu shot instead.!?! This office is not a good doctors office for children, and families.
I only gave star so it allowed me to post.
I think people should know. Patients and families deserve better!<//Text>

Fantastic nurses, and my fiancée and I love Dr. Torgerson. I myself came here as a child and Dr. Saied actually delivered me. It’s such a wholesome family community, I couldn’t imagine bringing my children anywhere else.</review>

We recently moved to the area & we had to let our family doctor, my son was in her care for 8 years.
I was very picky about who to choose for my sons future care, I definitely did my research and found great reviews on this clinic. Yesterday was his first appointment and I am very happy with my choice.

We were greeted by the friendly staff, all of my questions were answered & my sons physical exam was great. My son felt comfortable and happy in their care and that’s all that matters to me at the end of the day.

We look forward to being part of this great team.<//Review>

<rating>3<//rating><text>I bring both my daughters here, been coming here for almost 2 years now. Dr. Howell and Dr. Torgerson are very friendly and provide the best care for my babies. The front desk staff, Kat and Layla I believe is her name always make you feel welcomed. And the medical assistants always have a smile on their face.  However, the only issue is the wait time when you arrive for your appointment. Other than that,  everything is great.< /text><gmapID>0x809ac74363cb1bd9:0x42587d60b60711ca</gmapID>< Name>

This is a great office my kids have been here since they were toddlers. I had a couple issues with reminder calls but once I mentioned it that fixed it immediately and with a smile. I definitely would tell anyone with children to come to this office. Thank You Elk Grove Peds for keeping my kids healthy and safe!!!😘</text>

My brother recommended Elk Grove Pediatric to me when I was searching for a good doctors office before my daughters was born. That was 5 years ago and now my son who is going to be 2 in October attends this clinic as well. Our doctor is Dr. Torgersson and we absolutely adore her and Dr. Saeid. We love all the staff as well.<//review>

<text>It's a clean facility the staff are nice and helpful I'm ranking a 4 out of 5 because I believe that some nurses need to be retrained in giving shots to babies I watched the nurse give my child a shot but was rough with it meaning they jammed the needle into my child's leg I understand you are trying to get the shots done fast so they dont feel a lot of pain but the amount of aggression they used giving my child a shot was uncalled for I also understand they may of not known they were being a little too rough but I've seen many nurses give my kids shots and never had this where my child wouldnt stop crying and it's not like them to keep crying my child has high pain tolerance they usually never cry when getting shots other than that incident I do like this pediatric clinic and the staff thank you all</text><GmapID>0x809ac74363cb1bd9:0x42587d60b60711ca</GmapID>< Response>

<Text>My daughters been with Elk Grove pediatrics since birth. She’s 6 months old now. The office staff is very efficient and friendly. I’ve never had extremely long wait times or anything. Usually appointment times are open if we need to make a  appointment with short notice. Bed side manner of doctors we’ve seen have been good. We’ve seen Dr.Torgerson, Dr. Saied, and Dr. Howell.< /Text>< pictures>

If I could give 10 stars I totally would! I absolutely LOVE this Pediatric Office! Dr. Torgerson is our primary care physician! And she is amazing with my daughter Riley.  I also love love LOVE Sheryl,  one of the nurses, and they know us by name, always treat my daughter and I so kindly and make it comfortable. Plus, it's always quick for us to get in and out! How awesome is that!?!! I recommend this office to all my Mommy friends and strangers!< /Text>

Everyone is very friendly and helpful. They check your info days before you come so you don’t waste your gas. My son has gone to this office since he was born even after his doctor moved that’s how much we like this office and the staff. My son loves looking at the fish tank, watching the movies and getting a token to get a special treat after his visit.<//Text>

<text>Hands down Dr. Torgerson is the best pediatrician! Shes so personal, thorough, caring, and gives great advice! Theres another Dr. that I have heard great things about but never has he seen my children. The male PA is good too. Unfortunately I refuse to go in if the other Drs are the only ones that can see my babies. They are not very thorough and they say a lot of "probably..." and they never seem to explain their reasoning for their statements with research. Most of the little ladies who take you back are really great and the ones that aren't typically dont last long. And the paperwork ladies are so so great even though they're overworked. It never used to take long to get in and its been taking longer and longer but I'm hoping that's just because its flu/rsv season. Anyways Dr. Torgerson is what keeps me coming back! Good luck mommas!< /text>< Pictures>

Very unprofessional front office staff.. I made an appointment for my daughters 1st grade physical for school entry... before leaving the office I asked for copy of physical for school.. the young lady printed out a summary of the visit. I in-turn took that to the school to enroll my daughter and was told by enrollment counselor that the Dr. office knows there is a generic form that has to be filled out and signed in order for children to get in school.. I called the office asked for the form and was told it would’ve ready by the end of the day... never got a call back. I called the next day and was told that I should’ve know what forms the school needed and that it would take 3-5 business days to get said form signed!!! I asked for office supervisor to see why the young lady I had spoken with the previous day (Jaqueline) told me I could pick it up at the end of the day, the young lady said the office manager was in a meeting!! And laughed when I asked for her name!! Very unprofessional!!<//text>

I chose this office because of the high rating. Boy, was that a mistake. VERY UNORGANIZED. The office staff are all recent graduates who have no prior experience. It is very frustrating when I receive different and wrong directions for any of my concerns because apparently they don't communicate and it's apparent that training is not conducted for newer staff members. They also lack professional conduct and customer service. Appointments feel rushed and I always end up leaving with more questions. I've brought in simple paperwork to my son's appointments before and they refuse to sign it at the time of the appointment even though it literally takes 2 seconds, they say it will be processed within 3 business days. They charge $$ for immunization cards. My son needed special formula and I've spoken to his doctor at an appointment about getting the prescription so insurance can cover it. For 6 weeks they didn't submit a prescription to the pharmacy even after the pharmacy called AND faxed them nearly everyday. They claimed to have sent it and finally returned my call 6 weeks later to blame the pharmacy for "possibly losing it." Within the 6 weeks of waiting for the prescripthion, I've had multiple people from the office give me FALSE information such as "oh we don't write prescriptions for special formula" etc. For my son's 12 mo, they had us go to quest for blood work. Other offices do it at the office and it's a simple poke in the finger. Overall this office has been a headache!!! I've finally been able to switch to another one. Don't waste your time here.</Review>

Hi, everyone

My wife took our kids for their physical first time here and she said Staff was friendly , clean place, doctor was very knowledgeable and doctor seems to care for her patients.

The reason I gave them only two stars is because they never answer their phone. We reported this to one of their doctor who had seen our son, but seemed like the message did not reach.
Their answer machine says their hours from 7:45am to 5:00pm however I called many time from 7:45am until 8:15am and then I got tired and gave up on them. When I go to the clinic next time I will report this to their upper management. This is a huge concern!!<//Review>

Every appointment that we come here for my son is almost 3 hours long. If appointment time is 10am  then they another 45 minutes to call you in even though you come in 30 minutes before your appointment time. Parents take time off from work and there is no consideration given to time at this office. If you question why there is a delay in the appointment, staff rudely tell you that you can reschedule if you don't want to wait not understanding the point that if we arrived 30 minutes before the appointment then why is there a 45 minutes awaite past the appointment.<//Text>

Both my kiddos have been going here since birth. My daughter is now 5 and my son 1. My daughters first year I was a stereotypical first time parent and I was in the office multiple times a month and was always greeted with a smile, open arms. I never felt judged one time and they have become our family and a lot of the ladies in the office have watched my daughter grow! Amazing staff and Doctors! Over the years it has been amazing and we couldn’t ask for a better pediatric office!<//text>

Elk Grove Pediatrics is by far the best and cleanest doctor's office I've ever been to. The staff does everything in their power to make the patient and family feel comfortable and safe. I trust my doctor and they take great care of my child. Dr. Howell has been taking care of my son ever since he was born, and she has always been great to him. I only have good things to say about this place, thank you so much Dr. Howell!<//Text>

We have experienced Elk Grove Pediatrics in September 2016 for our new born daughter. As a transplant surgeon working in Belgium, it was a good opportunity to observe and note what could be the difference with our practice. What I have seen must be congratulated.  The care given to the baby are really excellent.  It starts with a very warm welcoming. The waiting time is very short. The experienced nurse and medical teams are extremely kind and professional. Finally, The follow up is well organized. I would definitely recommend this clinic.

Greetings from Belgium< /Text>

I absolutely highly recommend this place! Everyone is so nice from the front to the back! I love all the doctors here! I live in Elk Grove before and had to move to Natomas. I switched doctors just because it was closer to home but I absolutely hated it! I switched back here to Elk Grove Pediatrics and now drive all the way here! Love love love this place!< /Text>

I bring my daughter in every month or so for her wellness checks and the doctors and staff are always friendly and courteous. It's usually a minimal wait time and you're in and out pretty fast with a summary of the visit.
The only complaint I have is that in the waiting room there are two TVs that are constantly on and I got into an argument with the receptionists when I asked them to turn them off. My daughter is only 7 months old and I don't want her watching TV. The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends no TV until after two years old because it can damage their brains at such a young age and inhibit proper development. And even after two it's only supposed to be 15 minutes a day with parent interaction. The doctors also advise at this clinic (Elk Grove pediatrics) to limit screen time. So the fact that there two TVs constantly on in the waiting room that are filled with children is completely bizarre to me. I'm going to turn the TV off everytime I go there and if becomes an issue I'll find another clinic where the receptionists are not addicted to TV and our children are not being zombified.< /Text>

Very impressed with the service at Elk Grove. Just started taking my son here and it's been great so far. The doctors are really good with him and they make him really comfortable. They're very thorough and great at explaining things to me.<//Review>

My kids and I love coming here. The staff is friendly and never fails to put a smile on my son's face, even when he's sick and miserable. They act like they care about his well being and the dr spends a good amount of time with you to explain everything. It's also pretty easy to get an appointment pretty quickly.<//review>

My husband was patient as child here. Now our little girl is patient. The staff are so wonderful! I recommend only seeing Dr, Saied or Dr. Torgerson. Your child will be 100% taken care of, at fabulous time.< /Text>

Elk Grove Pediatrics is great, I know I can always count on them to take my children to whenever they are not feeling well, and for regular checkups. They are the best there and I would chose them over anyone.</review>

All 4 of my kids have been coming here for many years and we love it but the problem that we have been experiencing is this past year is getting an appointment if you're child is sick over night and getting a same day appointment will be impossible with them I have had to take my kids to the ER having to pay $50 dollar copays which is unnecessary can't even get a next day appointment will have to look for a better place at this point.< /Text>

I love Dr. Saeed, he is like a family member to me. He has been the pediatrician for all of my kids throughout their entire lives, ever since they were little. They are all grown now, but Dr. Saeed is now seeing my grandkids! He cares about all of us and it's so nice going to see him. Thank you so much!!<//Review>
