<text>I have only tried their chiplote sauce.
Their shakes are amazing 🍓
You do have to wait 15-20 but that just means you are getting things fresh...<//text>< Pictures>

Melissa D. At panorama mall not very friendly, just because my son asked about the type of sauce they had (since it was the first time w tried this food)she was very impatient and rude and didn’t give my son the receipt until I went to ask for it. Food was good.

<user_id>112191419875337678776</user_id><Review>Food was cold, fries weren't seasoned, and overall not a good combination better as two separate items,  buffalo covered pieces of chicken, some pieces were just breading not chicken. Really dissatisfied first and last time I go there.

UPDATE: I gave this place a second chance today and woah the improvement was just stellar fries were crispy and well seasoned and that buffalo chicken was good but not stellar, still kinda believe it's a bad food combination it's like very different eating fries with a fork.</Review></record>

Can I tell you, it is DELICIOUS! Explosion of flavor! It's a huge salad too! I have enough for 2 meals. My only suggestion is since I ordered through Doordash, would be to put the croutons on the side so they don't get soggy so fast. Otherwise, I would definitely order from here again and try their other items!<//Text>< Pictures>

Jovani the waiter was an excellent server, my associate and I felt his genuine. This is only from my own point of view, their menu is out dated, Olive Garden should include in their outstanding menu choices, at least one vegan menu choice dish.</Review>

I love this place . Great service. The manager Adam is the best he knows his boots and can answer any questions you might have. His employees are great as well the other Adam is vrry informative and can answer any questions you have. I love that they will oil and replace your laces for free of the life of the boots.<//Review>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Excellent experience and friendly customer service. Luis was very attentive and the red wing work boot 971 fit like a glove. They did run a little big so I sized down to 10 from 10.5.
One more thing they also have a free boot maintenance program where they clean and treat the leather of your boot and you have it back in around 24hrs.
Thank you very much for your help guys 👍</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Great selection. Was helped by Adam. This guy really knew his stuff. They do a couple of steps before they put you in a shoe or boot. Obviously they size you but then they check your arch, high and low pressure spots of your feet and body weight distribution as it pertains to your feet. That's all done by computer as your stepping on a mat and done free and fast! He had good questions and suggestions and answered all of my questions as well. Awesome customer service!!!< /Text>< userid>

Even though their shoes cost a little more they are so well made that they last twice as long it makes it worthwhile to buy them. The only downside is some of the newer employees don't know what they're talking about. So make sure you know exactly what you need when going in there< /Text>

I have bought three pairs of footwear here.  Customer service first time was 4/5.  Second time was 5/5.  They know their products and can explain well which shoes are ideal for which types of feet, and which shoe or boot works best for a particular type of activity.  Short of custom made boots or shoes, their handmade, USA made boots are as good as you will find.  Far superior to anything you will find at a sporting goods or department store.  Their non-USA made boots are about the same quality and price you find at a department store or good outdoors store.  Their lifetime lace replacement  and oil or polish feature is a nice touch.<//Review>

My Dad came here to retread his work boots. The prices are a bit high but in retrospect, your getting top quality gear. I haven't purchased anything from here yet, although I am poised to return after seeing the proper customer service + the promptness of the employees.

There was never a long wait from employee to customer, the service was timely  and they're very knowledgeable about footwear and the proper gear needed for the customer to complete their task without giving up comfort and flexibility.<//Text>

Zero stars if it was possible!! The service is the worst ever!! Talking about disrespect!! I asked to see if they had a certain size in a shoe and he told me " this are all the sizes available in this style in this row, if not we don't have it!! and walked away. Believe me if I would have seen my size, I would not be asking his worthless ass!! I'm sorry I interrupted his texting!!! I know it's not your store and I know you think you're entitled to have a job!! But in reality you're not even fit to have a girlfriend!!! You know who you are J!!!
Just the first letter of your first name don't want to be an ass and get you fired!! Just know that whoever owns this business worked for hard for it, and still does!!! I still bought a pair of boots because of the product that I believe in!!</text>

I was able to close escrow last week.  My loan was actually ahead of schedule.  Thanks to Tom from Caliber Home Loans. Tom and his team are very professional and made the loan process seamless. Although Caliber’s website is user friendly with task lists to do, Tom and his associates always explain everything in details.  He was responsive and attentive to customers’ needs.  His team worked very closely with the escrow team, helped address issues and made everything easy for his clients. This is important because it takes away all anxieties and the unknowns from the loan process.  I’m very happy and highly recommend Caliber Home Loans.  Tom is a go to person for your loan.  Thank you Tom & Melanie for all your help!<//text>

She kept us updated through every step of the process and was available to answer every single question we had.

As new homeowners my husband and I could not have been happier with choosing Caliber Homes as our lender! We especially loved working with Jenn. The communication was always amazing and we always felt comfortable asking a ton of questions (they were all answered). The process was smooth and easy through Caliber Homes. If we had to do this all over again, there is no doubt we'd choose Caliber Homes again!</Review>

Processing my loan with this company went very smoothly. Dee was amazing and always kept up with my loan. She had everything ready to go way before the first company I contacted. Dee was prompt which helped me in securing the house early and not losing it to competition. She was professional, kind, and respectful. Dee took the time to keep me updated on my loans and made sure things were done on time to ensure a closing within 30 days of finding a property. Her work ethic is truly exceptional. She responded promptly within minutes to emails and messages which help decreased a lot of anxiety. She provided me with great estimates on my loan which was very close to the final numbers thereby helping me know before hand what to expect. I had a wonderful and blessed experience. Work with Caliber Home Loans and you will know the difference. It was truly an exceptionally wonderful experience. Thank you Dee!!</Review>

<text>Jenn was a pleasure to work with. She made the home buying experience extremely easy. She was always available to answer any questions or assist with any issues that came up. I’ve made sure to recommend her to my friends that are in the market for a house since she was so easy to work with.<//text>< name>

<text>Have dealt with lots of lenders to handle loan adjustments and leniency because of the economic downturn. The language used by the Caliber representative left me with an impression different from all the other lenders. They are not helping you because of difficulties faced from the COVID situation. We want our money and we want it now, if not, we are going to grease you.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x809b1fd7af0f4aa9:0x45da975850f71556< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Absurdly long wait time and rude service. The food is pretty ok, but you have to order everything you want the first time. Adding to you order, like a desert or a second serving of a food item or drink, could result in an additional 45~60 minute wait. There is no English ordering-list so you will have to match up the numbers pictured on the menu or, in some cases, just guess. You're not going to get much help from the servers.< /review>

(Translated by Google) 2019 February 28th 10:30 Arrive at the Hyatt Restaurant, today a group of four people bunch, ordered 12 dim sum and three lunch specials
In about twenty minutes, A sister offered three dishes and six snacks. I immediately asked the waiter to send the soup and rice. After 20 minutes, the soup and the rice were still not available. I had to ask the minister and inform him. Still waiting for the white meal, and my lunch time is faster...
I have been waiting until 11:30. I am still waiting for the three-disc snack, the soup and the rice.... The fire is burying.
I immediately requested to pay the bill and pack it..... The ultimate waiter should pack the soup and rice, but still owe a snack.
11:33 Buried to leave. ... Total $85.61 Zero Tips 😡
I myself helped to open the peninsula, I feel that the peninsula is very good at serving the system... Who doesn’t know
"Nothing is worse, worse." I am really disappointed with Hyatt!

2019 二月二十八日 10：30 到達凱悦大酒樓, 今天一行四人食 bunch, order 了十二款點心和三款午膳特價小菜
二十分鐘左右阿姐奉上三碟小菜和六款點心, 我隨即要求侍應送上例湯和白飯, 過了二十分鐘例湯和白飯仍然欠奉, 我只好向部長查詢並通知他我仍在等候白飯, 兼且我午膳時間快過...
一直苦等至 11：30 我仍在等候三碟點心, 例湯和白飯....... 火都滾埋😡😡😡😡
我即時要求埋單和打包..... 最終人侍應把例湯和飯打包, 不過仍然欠了一份點心😡😡😡😡
11:33 埋單走人 ....... 總數 $85.61  零 Tips 😡
本身我幫襯開半島, 覺得半島嘅服務唔係咁好...... 誰不知
“沒有最差只有更差” 我對凱悦真的很失望呀！<//text>

(Translated by Google) The food is delicious, the big feast is a drink, and the general meal is very suitable. Hospitality is kind and welcoming, although there are many guests, you can still enjoy a comfortable meal.

< Review>
This place saved me time, money and aggravation. I had several people tell me that the rear red light on the driver side was out. I went in here to find a light bulb.  I really wasn't sure what I was looking for. The guy asked me questions and then he came out looked at my car.  Asked me to turn on my lights, step on my brakes, put the car in reverse, etc. He checked everything and said everything was fine and I didn't need anything.   Customer service like that just doesn't exist anymore. Thank you. Will definitely be back. Will send all my friends.<//Review>

<Review>Better selection and pricing than most NAPA stores. That said, it is by FAR the best customer service from the team there. Good guys indeed.< /Review>< Pics>

Horrible customer service, run down, and lacking many essential products. Go to the O’Reilly Auto Parts a couple mins southbound on El Camino...you’ll thank yourself later.<//Review>

<review>Staff was so rude and unhelpful. Was in here the other day to pick up a few things for my ‘63 Camaro, waited in line, only to be cut by some guy who wasn’t in line. Staff decided to assist him before myself. So rude, never coming back.<//review>< response>

The staff is really rude. I wouldn’t consider purchasing a motor here. Better off getting it from somewhere else. Reason said I went through 4 dud engines I don’t know how they passed inspections.</Text>

< Review>
Sold us a junk engine with supposedly low miles.  Swapped in for a customer and we had low compression.  Spoke with Engine World and followed their process and eventually removed the head.  I sent them these photos and they said it looked pretty normal for 50k miles.
..  Very unprofessional.  They told me they  bench test the compression on these engines at 1500 rpm!  I don't know any starter out there that cranks an engine over at 1500 rpm.  Junk engine, Don't trust these guys.</Review>

We are sorry you are experiencing an issue. We run our engines on a bench tester with a pedal operated electric motor. This runs a belt over the crankshaft pulley and we can command different rpms by use of a foot pedal. We do not use an automotive starter motor. Carbon buildup on the valves is common on Japanese imported engines because they do not use the same detergent rich fuel that we use here in the United States. We are more concerned about the issue of compression. That we take very seriously because all of our engines are bench tested before they are shipped out.\n\nIf you can give us a call so we can confirm the purchase and get you started on getting you a replacement engine. Just give us a call and we can start the warranty process. Never want you feeling like you did not get the help you need. 800-903-4430'}<//Resp><GmapID>0x80857e5f534c574b:0xe7e4ef719e09c85a</GmapID></record>

THIS PLACE IS A JOKE!! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! They sold me a so called "jdm transmission" .. IT WAS NOT JDM! It was a USDM transmission from a junk yard that didn't move.. Warrantied it out twice so far and still having different internal issues! I do not recommend this place for anything! What a joke!< /Text>

<review>Buyers beware!!! Buy somewhere else!!! We waited 3 weeks for them to rebuild a 2010 Subaru engine. Installed, no issues.. Vehicle is now out of the state and leaking oil from rear main seal. Blake who is the manager said there is no warranty on seals. Really??? They rebuilt the engine that they provided, they installed the seals and 3 months later it leaks!!! No warranty on seals on a rebuilt engine!!! Ridiculous. Lost all of Europa Motors business and all my affiliates.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<rating>1</rating><review>DON’T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!  I spent $1,500 to have my engine removed and have the used “Engineworld” engine installed.  Long story short is that the used engine did not work.  I was like you thinking that “oh, that’s everyone else...the bad experience won’t happen to me.”  Engineworld WILL NOT REIMBURSE YOU TO HAVE YOUR MECHANIC REMOVE THE BAD ENGINE.  So, there I was out another $1,500.  In the end I had my original engine rebuilt, which is what I should have done in the first place....if I would of just listened to the other reviewers.  Engineworld will tell you that these used engines won’t have more than a certain amount of miles but trust me when I tell you that they have no idea and no hard proof of how many miles, or whether you are getting a lemon or not.  These used engines come from Japan.  If they say that they tested the engine like they told me...that still won’t guarantee that the engine will work....compression testing is only one aspect of an engine’s health.  You cannot tell if an engine will work until after it is installed.  And, in the meantime while you are waiting another week or two to have your engine swapped out again you are probably losing more money using a rental...OR AT THE VERY LEAST IT’S VERY FRUSTRATING!
In Summary:  Spend a little more in the beginning so that you get a good peace of mind to REALLY KNOW the history of your engine...and you will save money in the end.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!  SAVING MONEY IN OTHER AREAS IS DOABLE BUT DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DON’T RISK TRYING IT HERE!< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
They were very helpful and knowledgeable when it came to supplying me an engine. They explained to me what I would have to do when I receive my engine to make it smog complaint  and with out a doubt I followed there recommendations and everything went great. Extremely happy with my purchase through them and plan on using them again.</Review>

I was able to order an old engine for an 1985 CRX. The price was good, the shipping was fast. Engine came clean and painted and the valve train looked brand new. Compression was perfect on all four cylinders. The engine ran beautifully and got me through 4 years of college and over 50,000 miles. Still no knocks or ticks. I just removed it for something with a little more power and for a restore as it is now a project/summer weekend cruiser. Great and quick service and they sell quality engines. I plan on ordering a new engine for my old Tacoma here soon. Awesome company if you're a mechanic and do your own work. Since they are imported from Japan some of the systems can be different. I had to use my original fuel system for my CRX since the Japanese emissions system was not compatible with my US version of the car.< /Text>

Called in and spoke to Blake the manager for a engine for my 2011 highlander was quoted $1350. The next day called back in and was quoted $1450. Asked several time how many miles are on the engine and stated under 50k miles because the engines was from japan. So i called around to 3 other salvage yards in the bay area. All of their engine had higher miles so i went with engine worlds. Note: Only reason i purchased a used engine and not repair my engine was because off the low miles stated from them. Replaced all gaskets and seal as stated on the contract from engine world and installed the engine into vehicle and after installation i inspected the work done and found a vin tag still mount on to engine and was painted over with gray paint. I ran the vin at the dealership. Come to find out the engine was not from japan but from a salvage 2011 sienna van from the US with current known miles of 112k from a toyota dealerships last service recorded before being salvaged. I contact blake to ask for a refund less then half the cost for false advertising and lying about there product and miles on it. He states owner will not refund anything but can give me another engine or refund my back for the engine. Now if i went with a engine replacement how would i know it has less then 50k miles in it? He knows i paid for labor to have it install and with all the gaskets and seal replaced back into the vehicle already. How does that make any since for me to pay for labor again because they know they don't cover labor cost. If they told me the truth about the actual miles on the engine i would have never purchase it from them and fixed my original engine instead. I even filed a claim with BBB  and still no refund. SO BUYERS BEWARE, if they tell you the engine has under 50k miles and it is from JAPAN i wouldn't trust them. That is how engine world do business SCAMMERS. They know the miles which the engines has before selling from the salvage vehicle it comes from or by running the vin tag on engine like i did. Customer who decide to have a used engine install from a shop and they say the engine came from engine world, do a little research yourself. The miles affect the cost of the engine big time. If you decide to go with them have them show you proof. It costed me thousands.

So any response to this review engine world?</text>

I ordered an engine for my Ford Mustang gt 4.6 from this place, when putting on I realized that many part looks different so I called them, the answer was that I have to put all parts from my old engine to the new one but after a week trying to finishing the job I found out that they gave me a 4.6 engine for a Ford Expedition which is not the same model as a mustang, if you buying from them be careful.< /Text>

<Review>Engineworld provides a service not seen with other engine suppliers. This company bench tests every engine for compression and oil pressure before giving it to their customer. Our dealership has been using them for years. We have never had a problem. It is nice to know there is an excellent supplier that provides quality used products. I highly recommend this company to anyone that needs an engine or transmission.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80857e5f534c574b:0xe7e4ef719e09c85a<//GmapID></record>

So far so good!  The 7afe Toyota engine I bought from Engine World is running great.  I've now put about 1500 miles on it.  It has burned about 1/4 quart of oil which is not bad.  Thanks engine world!<//review>

Most places that did have the transmission had ones with way too many miles on them. Engineworld was able to get me a transmission with low mileage. It was shipped across the country to my shop in just a few days. The transmission arrived very clean and drove amazing after install.

My Nissan Altima recently broke down, and my mechanic recommended Engineworld to me. I ended up getting a used engine for a great price. The engine only had 50,000 miles on it. The mechanic installed it without any issues. Happy I saved money and have my car back on the road.< /Text>

My son recently blew the engine on his Subaru. We ended up getting a Japanese imported engine from Engineworld. Our local shop installed the engine, and my son couldn’t be happier. He was so bummed when he thought he was going to have to get rid of the car. Thanks, Engineworld!</text>

Awful experience.  Spent $1700.00 getting their defective transmission installed before finding out that it was cracked and defective.  In order to use their “fully guaranteed” warranty I would have to spend another $1500 to get the defective transmission they sold me removed and another $1700 to get the replacement they were willing to provide installed. Blake assured me that THIS TIME he would make sure it was a good one!  Great Blake, why not make sure every one is in working order before you sell it? I ended up having to junk the car bc it wasn’t worth the labor costs and was unable to get a refund on the defective transmission.  Do not buy from these rip offs!</Review>

My experience her has been miserable. I was warned by most Repair shops in California area not to buy from them. I have been told that they have most junk yard engines. If engine goes bad they will just give you store credit. Customer service is miserable. They don't have proper techs to do tests. Every other mechanic I spoke to complained about them.

I will never recommend anyone to buy from them. It is waste of money and time. I'd rather buy from a Junk Yard.</review>

<Name>Michael Tang</Name><time>1392661143201</time><rating>1<//rating><Review>I purchased a V6 rebuilt engine from Engine World last year for our Toyota motorhome.  Within 1,000 miles, the engine broke an intake valve and left my wife, our 6 year-old son and myself stranded over 500 miles away in San Diego.  "Blake" at Engine World refused to send us another engine unless I prepaid for the replacement plus $200 in shipping.  (The money was eventually refunded.)  A month later we returned to San Diego after we had the engine replaced by a shop only to find an oil leak coming from the rear main bearing that Engine World installed.  We ended up paying more money to have the oil leak fixed.  Engine World refused to take responsibility for it.  The ordeal turned our vacation into a nightmare, and cost us over $3000 in towing, shipping, labor, hotel, and car rental.  I filed a BBB complaint against them only to be told that they will not compensate me a dime because the damage was not covered under their "Limited Warranty" that was written in fine prints.  I was initially alarmed by all the negative reviews I read but went to Engine World anyway because they were selling their engines for half the price of their competitors.  Now I know why they are the cheapest and have a mere 6-month "Limited Warranty".  What a nightmarish experience and it makes me wonder how long the replacement engine will hold up.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>I drive for Uber and Lyft in San Francisco. The hills and constant driving puts a lot of strain on my Toyota Prius. The dealer wanted to charge me over $4,000 to get a replacement engine. I got the same engine with low mileage for $1,250 from Engineworld. My Prius is back on the road, and I am back in business!< /Review></record>

<review>This company is very dishonest. They will do everything to avoid warranting anything. I just installed an engine for a customer, a few hundred miles down the road, the engine rear main bearing seal blows out and dumps all the oil out. The only offered a new seal. The said they recommend replacing all seals before engines are installed. I told the manager that we just purchased a rebuilt engine from them. He says it's still not covered because it is a "wearable" part and it's not covered. I asked do they warranty workmanship, the manager said "no". Absolutely unacceptable. This place sucks. Patronize this business if you're looking to be upset.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< review>
After purchasing an engine, from Engine World, then having problems with the motor, they said they would honor their warranty and reimburse us. After we took care of the warranty issue, we requested reimbursement and Engine World said they do not pay out warranties in cash/check, instead they issue you a "store credit". When going to purchase the next engine from Engine World after this, we inquired about our store credit, and they "could not find it in their books", even after speaking with the owner/manager of Engine World, the warranty has never been honored or paid out. Beware of this company!<//review>

I bought a used engine for my 2009 honda accord Ex-L v6 I had a honda technician swap it out for me and a 3 weeks later after the swap the engine was bad it came with bad piston rings and I called for my warranty and they said i can't be assuming it's that but I had a shop fix it waste of time buying from here save yourself time and money and just pay a shop to do everything and not be hassling to get a new engine from there warranty</Review>

<text>I sent tom an email about a 90 civic 1.6L si motor he said he had it available. Yesterday i emailed him to confirm it was still available, he said it was. I replied " cool thanks, i will pick it up in the morning." I got to the shop this morning (75 miles each way, im coming from Stockton)  and long story short they didn't have the motor and tried to sell me a 1.5L Dx motor and when i questioned it they tried to tell me its basically the same!!! If you need an older motor go somewhere else!! Not to mention the sales rep just tried to blame it on the owner.....

The response from the owner is bs don't believe a word of it.< /text><Response>{'time': 1552668521725, 'text': 'Our stock changes daily. In this case we had the engine when you emailed. But the engine sold that morning. We sell on a first come first serve basis. We do not hold engines unless payment is made. We are sorry we no longer had what you were looking for at that time. If you would like to give us a call we can check again to see if we have the engine in stock now. Give us a call at 800-903-4430.'}<//Response>< Time>

The first engine was not a good engine and the second one was shipped very slowly and was damaged when arrived.  They contract with Fed Ex and Fed Ex changed the billing so the return engine was billed to me and Engine World did not back me and after sending Engine World 7 faxes showing the error it might be handled but the owner of Engine World is a complete idiot and condescends to people who know way more than he does. If you want more problems than you started with call Engine World. But, if you are a professional and like dealing with professional people than you will be solidly disappointed.
ALL PROFESSIONAL SHOPS SHOULD AVOID THIS PLACE!< /Review>< pics>

****I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN!*****
THEY SOLD US A USED ENGINE WITH "50,000 MILES" AND WE TOLD THEM IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS  WAY MORE MILES ON IT THAN THAT. WE ASKED THEM TO SEND US A DIFFERENT ENGINE BUT THEY SAID THEY COULD NOT SO WE INSTALLED IT ANYWAYS. AFTER THE INSTALL 30 MILES LATER THERE WAS AN ENGINE KNOCK AND METAL IN THE OIL. NOW THEY ARE TRYING TO SAY THAT THE CAR OVERHEATED WHEN IT NEVER DID. THEY SOLD US A JUNK MOTOR AND WILL NOT EVEN WARRANTY IT FOR THE 6 MONTHS WARRANTY THAT I HAD ON IT. THEY ARE ALL CROOKS! NOW WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM TO COURT.< /Review>

<review>I used to do business with them, and I have done business with alot of jdm engine suppliers, but they seem to charge double what local importers charge and at the same time they remove all the external parts so that they can make a few extra bucks, they expect you to give them your core which is absurd ive never heard of any seller doing that, and they spray paint there motors transmissions without cleaning which is funny because it look better without doing that, i really hope they see this and consider changing there ways otherwise they lost a good customer< /review><pics>None<//pics><user_name>swex. w.</user_name><response>None</response>< user>

<Text>Fonz's restaurant is a fantastic restaurant!  We had dinner there this past weekend and it was really great.  Its one block off the beach and a favorite among locals in Manhattan Beach.  The steak is tasty, and moderately priced and the staff could not have been better.  Thank you Fonz's !  See you soon!</Text>< gmap_id>

Great local establishment serving steaks, seafood, and pasta.

Nice ambiance with an antique home feel. I love the painting of the octopus near the front.

We ordered the herb roasted chicken, sea bass, and calamari. All dishes were delicious, especially the sea bass. They also have a great kids menu and the grilled cheese with fries was also delicious as the adults stole samples from the little one.

For dessert, we had the Fonz's bar. A very healthy serving of two large caramel bars encrusted with nuts and topped with ice cream. This dessert is to die for.

Overall a great place and I would definitely return!</review>

We stopped for a Friday dinner without any reservation, we like the atmosphere inside,
Food was pretty great and we really enjoyed the food.
Unfortunately, the restaurant was fully packed and we barely heard each other as all tables around were very noisy while the restaurant isn't acoustic as I felt in other restaurant in the area.

I'll stop by for another try for a weekday dinner.</Text>

<Text>My husband and I absolutely LOVE coming to Fonz's, as do our friends!  The food is incredible -- especially the Swordfish Tostada -- which is completely unique, fresh, and wonderfully tasty, and fits in with the whole beach vibe.  You feel like you're meeting at a friend's home every time you walk in the door of the restaurant.  Danny and Gator and all the waitstaff and bartenders, could not be any more gracious or accommodating.  We go out for dinner quite a bit and Fonz's is one of our all time favorites!< /Text>< Pics>

Parking is hard for those who prefer hard coinage to plastic for parking meters. If you are going to spend over 300 bucks for food, it would be nice if the resturant would help with breaking bills to pay meter.  Want more business? Dont let my hispanic husband grovel for change and deny him and then let his white in-laws ask and you happily provide. Two sides to every coin. Food marginal.Service fake.< /Review>

We have dinner at Fonz's regularly.    I have a rack of lamb almost every time I'm there and that's because it's the BEST I've found at the beach, or  anywhere I've eaten in LA.  Try it,   you'll like it!<//Text>

<Text>Been going here for years! absolutely love the atmosphere, i have since got the know the owner Danny pretty well, he took the time to walk around and meet with each table. Amazing food! great prices for the area and a live-long location for me to visit each time i head to LA. I 'm a United States Marine, i've traveled all over the world and this is trunly a top class restaurant.</Text>< pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) Definitely worth a try! The restaurant recommended by the host on the last night in the United States, the ingredients are very fresh. Remember to order shaw burger and rib eye steak, cheese cake is also very good. The workmanship and presentation are at a 5-star level, and the taste is also 5-star.

Food is great; service was not. My party of 4 was seated for at least 20 minutes before finally being acknowledged by an employee (who we flagged down). We ordered our food and our drinks and had another long wait before any food came out. One of our dishes was incorrect and had to be sent back. There was a wait between every single dish for our table. Other tables seemingly received much better service than our own. Bottom line: this place has delicious food and good service unless you're not of Asian descent. Will probably stick to getting take out from now on.< /review>

<Review>Very good Chinese restaurant in an off-beaten location.  Very good authentic dishes and great prices.  It is not a fancy restaurant but something you would find in Chinatown without going to Chinatown.  Parking is good and service is fine.   I am looking forward to returning soon!  It is located next to a great Asian market, and makes for a perfect outing when in the area!< /Review>< pics>

The food is alright. They offer the typical dishes that one would expect, from an authentic Chinese Restaurant. However, the quality of their service is very inconsistent and can be slow.< /Text>

One of the few Chinese family style restaurants that don't use MSG in their food.. and this place proves that you don't need it for food to taste good.

This place is packed and for good reason. They have a 3 dish for $22.99 special that can feed a party of three. Or they have their standard offerings where you get an even bigger portion. Unfortunately I don't think they have the staff to handle this type of volume as the food came out pretty slow. On a Sunday night, we ordered our food at 6:30 PM and the first dish that came out was close to 7:00 PM, and the last dish came out around 8:30 PM.  Another problem with this restaurant, is there was a line of about five people deep waiting for the restroom.

Most of their dishes were spot on and memorable. Their soup of the day was on the mild side which is fine since there's no flavor enhancer. In fact, it was refreshing. They do make their Salty Fish and Chicken Fried Rice (there's a pungent smell so and the fish texture can be a turn off to some) very aromatic and with plenty of salty fish. The Chicken Curry had good flavor, but would've benefit from have more sauce. Garlic Green Bean was nice and crispy but would've prefer if they used less oil. Their Stir Fry Egg with Bitter Melon was well done, and so was their Fried Tofu. Their Sale and Pepper Spare Ribs was standard and would've been better if they cut the pieces of pork in smaller pieces.

This is one place worth trying but bring your patience.< /review>

<review>It's Chinese food in its extremely basic form, but done incredibly well. It's extremely affordable for what you get. From the front it looks very clean, but the closer you get to the back, the messier it gets. Not a huge issue but it should be cleaned up a bit.

The one thing it does well is its affordability. For the quality you get, the price is fairly cheap. The To-go option is also good as it's extremely quick and easily obtainable.

Very good option coming here. Would bring family here.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

As a long time customer it's sad to write this review. However we have had the same problem for the last 4 visits.</review><gmap_id>0x808f903d5e328def:0xf345a50dc9e3afb3< /gmap_id>< Resp>

Inexpensive and tasty Chinese food. One can order three dishes on their "family menu" for under $22.<//Text>

We have been eating at the Great Wall for nearly 20 years and have always enjoyed it.....but tonight was spectacular and we couldn't stop eating. From the delicious wonton soup to the honey walnutprawns , tender beef with green beans in a mild flavored black bean sauce and wonderful Peeking spare ribs.
Excellent service with plenty of staff to take care of the crowd.
Much busier now than ever and it's no wonder! Thanks for the delicious dinner!!!<//text>

<Review>My family and I have been going to this place for a very long time. This would have to be one of my favorite places to eat Chinese food. The staff is friendly and the food is so flavorful. Just writing this review makes me want to order some food. Some of our go to dishes would have to be the Hong Kong Style Chow Mein..Salt and Pepper Pork.. Honey Walnut Prawns.. and the Wonton Soup. The prices are very reasonable too!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Polite service. One time I paid for gas and left without pumping the gas. I was able to come back and get the fuel I paid for without any problems. The scratchers are kinda hit and miss here. Although these stores have a great fuel rewards program. If you buy Shell gift cards with your rewards card you get an additional five cents off gas per gallon. It adds up each time you purchase a card, which is nice.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Prices look good until you read the fine print... lower prices only when you buy a carwash! Pull in somewhere it's easy not this scam of a place! Saw a trailer and rv struggling to get gas! Very tight turns on busy corners!< /review>< Pictures>

It's your average gas station. VERY tight turn around; not for large trucks, trailor's or RV's.< /Review>

<text>I stopped in for mousetraps on my way home from work and was immediately greeted by George.  He was really friendly and helpful.
If he isn't in management yet, I expect he will be soon.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Very clean and organized store and friendly personnel.  Awesome experience!< /text>< rating>

<text>Fatally Flawed - Every visit, the cashier starts the interaction with "Phone number for your Ace rewards?"  This is exceptionally rude, as it intentionally makes an assumption the customer has joined their club. Not only are rewards clubs a privacy invasion, they are an attempt to manipulate my behavior, and most importantly (since I'll never join) this slows down the interaction of actually making a purchase and is an entirely unwelcome interruption to my task at hand.  If I say "I don't have one" they gleefully waste more of my time trying to get me sign up.  If I respond in the same manner as the cashier asked the original question - that is ignoring the goal of the person across from you such as telling them up front you're not interested - they act offended, like a street hustler who believes he has a right to trick you but just got found out!

Dear Ace manager... you should know that if I come in again and my time is yet again wasted with anything to do about your club I will file a BBB report on the issue. Need to satisfy Ace corporate morons pushing the program? Put a sign on the register for the stupid club and leave it at that!  I'll even provide a respectful sample cashier script... "Hi, did you find everything you needed today?" .... "thanks for coming in, we hope to see you again soon!" ...and leave it at that.  I would actually want to return if I were treated like that!  This is your opportunity to train your cashiers to respect others - they came to buy something, and that is all.  This behavior ruins an otherwise nice store... more games like this = more Amazon!     Love, Alex.

Edit:  The store posed as a random user and replied to my post.  Classic! Sadly you can't help the willfully blind!</text>< Pictures>

<Review>The sales man was very friendly and knowledgeable but the cashier was average and did not smile. Then I back there several times when they was closing the store and a middle age blond straight her cashier was always very rude to me however very nice to others, so make me think its because I have terrible accent and she was mean and racist. I could not take anymore and I even told her that's she is rude. Hope she will never work with public anymore, because she is mean. This happened in Escondido CA. No wonder that store did not make. Because the employees probably.< /Review>< pics>

Store himself is very good and peoples up front is very friendly , but  management or supervisor guy I don't know his name he was on back  he is not friendly at all. He did not liked my accent. I asked him simple question and he pretended like I am speaking gibberish and made me very uncomfortable. I do leave  half mile a way from this store and very convenient for me , but because of this guy not me,not my friends and not even my relatives ever will shop in this store . Sorry ACE you should pay more attention who you hired this days.

They seem to have a good assortment of stuff but it's a bit overpriced. Still nice to have in the neighborhood for a quick bolt or tool.<//review>

I go here on Tuesdays for their BOGO on the bone-in wings!
Can't beat that deal.
They also have potato wedges and fried pickle chips!
80 TV's to watch your favorite sport team.   It does get
loud and lively!< /review>

My daughter and I are traveling around northern California and stopped for lunch, a fair price range for both hefty and light eaters.  The service was pleasant. Our waitress was helpful.  They have wings down...it was good.< /Review>

I ordered the street tacos with no pico and no cilantro. I am deathly allergic to tomatoes. I got my order and there was cilantro and pico all over my food. I couldn't eat any of it and when I called them to talk to them about it I got put on hold. I was on hold for more than 18 minutes. Not please this time, not at all!< /Text>

Our server was attentive and everything was correct and tasty.. our only complaint was the appetizer came out the same time as our entree's which for obvious reasons was a little frustrating.< /Text>

I was there on Saturday and there was only one waitress serving the bar area and she was also the bartender. But the real issue was waiting for our food it took little over an 1 hour... it was ridiculous!!!. It was not like we have a big order or a big group. Just me and my BF, So overall WORST experience for dining in.<//Text>

< Review>
Took my nephew for his birthday and the staff refused to seat us for 54 minutes because they were favoring those already seated during the NBA Draft.

Asked for a take home order instead and they said 15 minutes but took 3 orders out to tye SAME people who had been seated for over an hour.<//Review>

< Review>
Ordered online and they forgot some of my my food, I was upset because it was food the kids had ordered! I always check my food, but this time I was in a hurry and I was tired from a longs day work, so I didn't realize we didn't have all of our order, but when I called in and explained to them what had happened, I had no problem with them offering a refund to my card, which was awesome.</Review>

<Text>This is a great place to bring your family. It is a little pricey. For 3 people...mac and cheese,all American burger, and the grilled chicken wrap with the medium order of traditional wings and a snack size wings to go; $75. The service was good, and so was the food. Next time happy hour might be fun.<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

We went on a Tuesday so there was an hour long wait for food, but it was also buy 1 get 1 free night. So that was understandable. Lots of flavors to choose from.< /review></record></dataset><record>

I will never come back to this place again  I came to eat with my mother for a dinner after that we had sat the server never came not even to take our drinks we were there for 45 minutes or almost an hour we tried to see if we could see a manager or supervisor around the area they were nowhere to be seen not even around the cash registers where people buy their to go foods we only walk up to the sitting area and we notify the employee that was sitting this is one of the worst places that I have ever been no managers no supervisors and no servers the owners of the company need to check and have a better training of their management employees that they hire</review>

Delicious food friendly service. Took a bit too long for my food though.. overall pretty good. Very clean inside and out... Other than the  Parking lot, had broken glass scattered  with trash maybe someone should be keeping it clean? To end on a good note, if you like the sauces they serve on the food they have it bottled so you can buy it and take some home! Genius!< /review>

Great time here as always. Lovely treatment from the waitstaff, and so patient. They were so on top of making sure we had everything we needed. Heck they didn't even mind when we realized that we just wanted some drinks and decided to go home and cook something there instead. Not too many places are so cordial feeling anymore and it's that utterly relaxed vibe there that I love. Keep up the amazing work people and I'll keep giving you large tips for small tabs lol.< /text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>The service was good, restaurant itself and the bathrooms were clean. The food was very average. The wings were over cooked and very dry. Allot of drummettes had barely any meat on them. The sauce was also not distributed properly, with some wings almost naked. My kids had the hand breaded chicken tenders, which were very good. The food wasn't terrible, just wasn't great.</text>< Pictures>

<text>We placed our order we received our food we had three side dishes the wing for cold I had to get my own water and and napkins also we had to ask where was the salad and it look like it was left over.
When I asked the waitress do you serve them cold she should know I'm sorry for that walked off.
I thought I was going to enjoy myself there to see the game we finished our drinks paid our bill and and lift can even finish watching the game I was so upset...</text><time>1570506483577</time>< Rating>

Had to pick up an order (door dash) with multiple beverages. BWW does not provide drink holders. The one star is for the nice employee who helped me to my car with them.  Thank you.< /review>

The Tuesday halfprice original special can't be beat. Me and the bros shared a few medium originals and the wings were cooked perfectly! The cooks made sure they were saucy and delicious. Definitely coming back for the Tuesday specials!< /review>

This is a good spot if you like watching sports. Restaurant is surrounded with big screen tvs.Food is very good too, likely there specialty is chicken wings, but you have lots of other choices. They  also open late<//Text>

You can never go wrong with wings. They have an array of flavors. With bone-in and boneless options. Their food too Is great. Good kids menu. What goes best with wings is beer! Ice cold brews in tap. Good variety to choose from. Decent selection of mixed drinks too. Friendly staff and environment. I recommend this place for sure.< /review>

<review>Delicious food friendly service. Took a bit too long for my food though.. overall pretty good. Very clean inside and out... Other than the  Parking lot, had broken glass scattered  with trash maybe someone should be keeping it clean? To end on a good note, if you like the sauces they serve on the food they have it bottled so you can buy it and take some home!

< Review>
Been coming here for the past 9 years. 9 years its indeed a lot of time. It has its good times to ckme and bad times. Bad times its mostly because of all of the costumers coming in at the same time and they take longer to get the food out. But at times when theres barely anyone and theres no games on tv, service is fast and not rushed.<//Review>

Got there and the new girl messed up my order (i get it shes still learning) and I brought it back and the manager had a fresh meal made for me and included all the things they hadnt given me before at no extra charge. They probably have a high turnover rate so it doesnt surprise me that employees make mistakes but the managers are extremely well trained at this BDubs.< /text>

The bathroom stalls are very nice. Definitely a place I would go to hide from my enstranged uncle as he drunkenly stumbles through the building in an attempt to find me and force feed me their hottest hot sauce at our family reunion.<//Review>

This is a good spot if you like watching sports. Restaurant is surrounded with big screen tvs.Food is very good too, likely there specialty is chicken wings, but you have lots of other choices. They  also open late</text>

<review>The service is so horrible to the point of waiting is beyond unreasonable I don't understand why they take so long this is my second time coming and every time it seems the cooks take forever to get our food. Buffalo wild wings is beyond. I'm so dissatisfied!!!! Then when I got my food my wings were extremely cold not even hot. I had to complain to the manager before and after im so furious I will never come here again. This store needs HELP and more proper training.</review><username>JojonJess Garcia< /username><Date>1559284298331<//Date><rate>1<//rate>< pics>

I wish I could rate 0. One of most dirty places I have ate in the US. My wife and I went for dinner. They kept us waiting for about 50 minutes, then they said they lost the list of names. Then waiter dropped sauce on me. Quesadilla was really bad with rotten lattuce and what not. I am fan of Buffalo Wild Wings, but I think the reputation of Buffalo Wild Wings is harmed by its Stockton branch. I will definitely avoid this next time.<//Text>

Food was good. However I called in my order then still had to wait well over a half hour past my pick up time for my food.  The poor guy at the register was working his butt off while other servers and a manager either played with their cell phones or stood and watched the room.  If it was a busy night I would understand but it wasn't.  No reason for it to take over an hour for a small wing and onion rings<//Text>

When  first went there it was pretty good. Decided to make it a regular visit. After awhile it just started going downhill. This last time I decided we will not return. The place was noisy so we went outside where it was still noisy though not painfully so. We got there at 1:30 we were promptly served alcohol and then waited we could not talk it was still too loud. We got the food at 3:00. The wings were still pretty good but my wife received a salad that was closer to compost than fresh and was swimming in a puss like substance. She did not eat it. I think it might be a fine place if you want to drink and watch the game. Eat before you go and plan on doing little visiting.<//Review>

Grocery store is right across the parking lot. Lame. Wanted soup. Soup is listed on the menu but not carried at that restaurant. It is carried at other restaurants so that's why it's on the menu. Lame. Out of Philly cheese steak because there's no more meat. What, no other meat you can use? Lame. And they weren't even busy.< /Text>< Pics>

Service is slow as usual. Drinks were eh, their "top shelf" is not exactly premium grade in my opinion. All that they really have going for them is the vast amount of tvs to watch the ball games on.</Text>

The service was fast in my oppinion and they give a slice of chocolate cake to those who go on their birthday. There was one waitress who would sing Happy birthday to people as well and it was apparent that she had vocal training. It was a great set up where you could see all the important games without having to strain your neck. The wide assortment of sauces have something for everyone, I particularly liked the Curry sauce.<//Text>

<Review>The lack of service is what killed this Buffalo Wild Wings for myself and several work friends.

We ( 8 people in total) arrived at 10 PM to a slightly packed house for a Tuesday night. After getting seating in the Bar Area we sat and conversed as we waited for menus and a server to come by for drink orders.

After 5 minutes of sitting and waiting we grabbed a menu and decided on which foods to order to help when the server came up to get drink orders. We figured help the server and the kitchen along at the same time instead of the time delay waiting for the drinks and ordering.

After a few more minutes, a friend decided to set a timer and see how long it would take for someone to come over and acknowledge us.

After 10 minutes on the timer ( at this point 17 or so minutes had passed) a server came up with menus and told us he would back to take our orders.

5 minutes later ( roughly 23 minutes since we had sat) and no server came by. We got up and left as a server came rushing up to "check on us".

Sorry BWW if this is the service to be expected, then sadly you will not see us here again.

Please be mindful people and call ahead to ensure it is not too busy otherwise what happened to us may happen to you< /Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<review>*Reccomended = Its a Gamble*
08/24/19 1:30pm

Service: Good: Was greeted at the door and sat down pretty fast in a clean booth. Waitress, was sufficient in her work, helped us decide on what we wanted to order and was constant on visiting our table.

Food:
Wings: Delicious and fresh, could use a little work on distributing the big wings and small wings evenly.
Salad: Bad, if I wanted 5 day old salad I'd go to walmart pick up a salad and wait 5 days to eat it. Could use some work on dating your food and making sure it is all ServSafe Compliant.

Cleanliness: While being seated there were quiet a few tables that have not been busted. If it were busy I would understand, but it was a slow with 2 maybe 3 tables with 2 - 4 people each.
Floor: Semi dirty I asked the waitress if it were busy she said it was a semi slow day. Could use some work on making sure the tables and floors are cleaned and ready to be used when a rush does come.

Environment: Great, I had a great time hanging with my mother.

Having over 12 years of Customer/Food/Restaurant/Managerial experience & with a Manager Food Safe Certificate. The thing I'm most concerned about was the salad, if the salad doesnt look safe to eat what other foods do you guys have that is not servsafe compliant?< /review><Rate>2< /Rate></record>

<Text>The wait was a bit long. Our server Savannah was gracious and always had a smile on her face when I requested for a slice of lemon.  We ordered a large and medium order of traditional wings, plus a bleu cheese burger with sodas and an ice tea.  Was a bit surprised with the bill of $71.88.  I now know why I dont go often to BWW. -- quite pricey.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Wings , wings , wings ... you pick the amount and the flavor .
They have a full bar and bar area .
sports on the Many TVs that hung around the walls . Not that you’ll hear any of them cause the music they ply is quite loud , I been there several times and it is always very loud .
They are open late so it’s a good place to get some late night food not only wings they have other selections if you don’t want just wings . The staff was friendly.</Text><username>john lopez</username><Pics>None<//Pics><Time>1506358747387</Time>< user>

Every time I come hear service is extremely slow. We sat here tonight for 13mins until someone said "I'll be right with you" we were sitting at out table for 34minutes until we got our first drink. Took about 20mins after ordering to get any beer. Just overall bad service and slow employees. Just for reference we were in the bar area there were only 6 tables including us with people and she said "sorry there's only 2 of us" 1 person with 6 tables shouldn't even be difficult.</review>

I came here with a couple of coworkers late at night and the place is cool and hip. The food was really good, I personally tried the avocado cheese burger and it was wonderful. However, not the best service. Everything was going fine I mean we were stared down a bit at the entrance but nothing peculiar or out of the ordinary.  They took a little while to take drinks but we weren't inpatient. They brought the order out wrong, rootbeers instead of coke, dr pepper instead of sprite. We were all so tired we just ended up swapping drinks. Three of us got burgers and we all got it all mixed up as well, regular onions instead of grilled, onions insted of no onions. Once again we were all so hungry and tired that we ended up just eating it like that, it was still pretty good. As we finished we were just talking and hanging out and the waiter kept coming along almost pressuring us to leave till finally she told us we had to pay because she needed to leave as her shift was ending.  We stood up to leave and pay. I understand that she needed to leave but it was a bit embarrassing and she did tell us we could still go sit down after paying but it was kinda humiliating to do so. Anyways the food was still pretty good so I'd still come back for that.< /Text>

The hot wings were so dry they looked old for sure. The other 2 flavors were fine. But id rather go to wingstop where the wings are made to order and its cheaper. Buffalo wild wings charges more for old wings. No thanks, the waitress was nice tho< /review>< pictures>

People that were waiting to be sat walked out, others were getting upset. At one point we counted 10 tables that sat dirty and other that was wiped down 5 times by 5 different employees including the manager. Food is always good, but service is horrible.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Waited for a very long time to be seated and parties coming in after me were seated before... waited at the booth for over 20 minutes and were not even offered our drinks. Requested to call the manager on my way out and he was not courtious, did not offer a new service or an apology. Horrible service!!!</Review>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I just watched the Khabib vs McGregor fight there. It was awesome! Great place to watch sports and get some good food ata decent price. I'm definitely going to spend some Sundays at Buffalo Wild Wings. Love the atmosphere. If your a sports fan and need a place to catch the games, it is definitely the place to go.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80900c54bcc04bc9:0xb735cbd369355e95< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's ok. It's wings and beers. It's nice for after work or with the friends, possibly to pregame with food, but ultimately it's a sports bar. It's loud and it takes forever to get your ticket to leave. The staff are super friendly though. Also, try the street tacos.<//Review>

They tend to take long even when they arent busy...also dont recomend their shakes or cheescake bites. But the wings are good! (Edited) just came back another day to see if the service would be the same.....my server literally sat at a table with people she knew. I looked at all the other tables she was serving and like mine once our cups got low they weren't refilled. Very disappointed that not even the manager saw his employee not doing their job. Wont be coming back to this one!!! All in all the food is good but the coustomer service is very poor!< /Text>

<Date>1549006895995<//Date><review>The "manager" Jim and server named Jennifer are extremely rude and unprofessional. Jennifer lost my debit card and was frantically looking for it all over the place and tried to accuse me of never handing it to her in there first place. They must have  been drinking  or doing drugs on the job who knows? After looking throughout the restaurant myself, my son found it on the floor completely in the opposite direction  from where we we're seating! When I  complained to the "manager" Jim he was unapologetic and even   allowed Jennifer to laugh in my face. When asked what was funny and why they were laughing. They were both extremely sarcastic with a smerk on their face and basically told me I was lieing and that she had never lost my card and that I never handed it to her.I was completely baffeled and lost for words  so therefore just walked out and decided I would call in and complain the next morning.  It's now been over  a week and I am still waiting from a call back from the General Manager.
I will never be going there again and will make sure everyone knows about my horrible experience</review><username>NATALIE MEJIA< /username></record></dataset><record>

I don't know what it is, but I've ordered my food twice through Doordash.  Both times the delivery person is waiting longer than usual for my food to be prepared.   It seems BWW doesn't cook the food until wayyyy after the driver arrives to the restaurant.  Also, I only received 8 wings - for $12!  Too expensive for too little.  And my drink wasn't even filled to the top.  If I order a large,  32oz drink, that's exactly what I should've received.  I will not be doing service with BWW anymore.<//Text>

Might as well go to BWW in Modesto
Worst waiters ever
“MEL” is the worst waiter who has no sympathy for people hope you never get her

J.B & Miranda are great waiters and they would do such a great job taking care of you if you are lucky to be there the nights they work.< /review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Called in a takeout order for one of their salads and requested that extra lettuce be added.  I have made such requests in the past without incident.  However, when I arrive to pick up my order, the cashier informs me that she "asked the manager" and my request could not be honored.  The salads here are flavorful, but very small, so I was extremely unhappy.  When I called to ask to speak with the manager, he had to call me back.  Once he did, he asserted that he never informed his staff that a request for extra lettuce could not be honored.  I don't know who to believe, but I do know that I will be taking my business elsewhere.<//Review>< time>

(Edited) just came back another day to see if the service would be the same.....my server literally sat at a table with people she knew. I looked at all the other tables she was serving and like mine once our cups got low they weren't refilled. Very disappointed that not even the manager saw his employee not doing their job. Wont be coming back to this one!!! All in all the food is good but the coustomer service is very poor!< /Review>< Resp>

Ordered for pick up. Their system was down and didn't accept my gift card. They told me I could pay for the food with cash or credit or leave. Great service guys, learn how to use your own system.<//Text>

The cooks need to add more sauce to the wings.

The last time I came here for a to go order. I was second in line and my food was cold. I called a manager and he only credited 20 dollars on a 90 dollar meal. I think his name was Darren.</Text>

<Review>Me and my friend went on a late sunday to buffalo in march ln and  it was not busy we seat on the bar area and the serves dont come at all to out seats and they ignore us... I ask the server name “Alex” he has green eyes and its tall. We been seating here for 10 minutes and then he says everyone else is, and he say there is a wait and he walks away. If he is a server he should be more attentive and nice and at least get the menus and not ignore us too. He was rude! He ruined the night!! If he is not happy in the workplace then he needs to apply to other jobs.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Good food and atmosphere, but it's usually a long wait for food and they always forget to bring my appetizer before my food. I usually have to ask for a drink refill too. But, I continue to revisit BDubs time & time again. I just have to set my expectations before I go.<//text>

Buffalo wild wings has been the same at every location I've visited. I feel like they are all the same which is nice. I suggest the Asian zing sauce on your wings. Sort of sweet sort of zippy. Big daddy Jack burger is massive if you're hungry. It has pulled pork on top of the pattie. They do Pepsi products so coke drinkers be warned. They can get pretty busy depending on the season but there is always some sort of sport playing on the tv's. UFC, NFL, NBA, WNBA, NHL, MLB, and all the other ABC's<//Text>

<review>When I came here, the place was over crowded, I was seated on a bad seat at the full bar (I think it was a kids seat), and had to wait too long for everything.

Also, being from out of the country, when I showed a passport as an ID that made a mini scene which I found to be rude, not a tourist friendly place.

the food is not great, and the prices are not cheap, I wouldn't come here again.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Ordered for pick up. Their system was down and didn't accept my gift card. They told me I could pay for the food with cash or credit or leave. Great service guys, learn how to use your own system.</review>

Its always a fun atmosphere at BWW. Staff are friendly. Some waitresses are a little slow but I didn't mind because we were staying to watch a football game. Love the variety of drinks available. Definately recommend going here!!</review>

Great tasting wings, when theres someone there that dosent skimp on the sauce. I order take out about 3-4 times a month and lately its been a hit or miss on the sauce. Some times theyre great, other times the wings are  very dry with a bit of watery sauce at the bottom. The last 2 times ive ordered extra sauce, the first time I though they actually listen but I think I just got lucky, because agian, even after asking for extra sauce, my wings are dry.< /text>

We waited for 10 minutes and did not get our menu until we had to ask for it. We then waited another 40 minutes and still were not served. This was probably due to sitting outside. In addition, there were other people that were served next to us and the waitress ignored us when we asked if we can order. Probably will not come here again. Very bad experience.<//Text>

<text>I'm 32, came in with my family and they wouldn't serve me a beer cause my I'd was expired. I asked if someone who was 70 came in with an expired I'd would they serve them, no we wouldn't sir. Lol anyways thank you for be the only restaurant or bar that has refused to give me a beer in the last 2 months, use common sense.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Gmap_id>0x80900c54bcc04bc9:0xb735cbd369355e95</Gmap_id><userid>109649499460582129314<//userid>< user_name>

Super super super poor service. Got there around 9:30 p.m. and no one greet's us until five minutes after and bad waiter an waitress took too long just to get the drinks took about 15 minutes just to get a french fries appetizer took about 5 minute just for a refIl on drink took about 20 minutes just for a burger an some wings. Really poor service well not be going there no more because it hapen to me 3 to 4 times already  I advise people don't go there< /review>

Kitchen staff (the ones that brought us our food) was very friendly and pleasant, but the waiter/waitressing staff was horrible and need to be replaced.  Service was slow, we almost had to tackle them to get our drinks refilled and they didn't get our order correct.  Not to mention they left a ranch spill smothered all over the floor for the entire time we were there watching our game  It takes a lot for me to leave a bad tip but they didn't even deserve the 5% tip I left.  Will never be going there again.  Worse BWW I have ever been to.<//text>

<text>Very bad service didn't get anybody to get us drinks or anything we sat for a while before someone finally came. Ranch spilled all over my husband and waitress did not even say anything and walked of winking at other customers to not say anything it was so wrong and humiliating and they are treating us like we did something. And she didn't apologize or anything. Manager acted like it was not a big deal at all. It was the worst service I ever had and they are so inconsiderate<//text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Salad was ok for bagged salad....
Wings were ok.... but server didn't bring celery or ranch until we were almost done.

I took Russell and Ruby into Buffalo Wild Wings, my FAVORITE place, so that they could experience it for the FIRST TIME!  They are now Wildlings, like me lol! Can't wait to go back again. Clean, and full of fun, friendly staff and they all seem to love working there. The only thing that happened, was a young woman running her mouth, saying mean races stuff, trying to start a fight. In front of a lot of little children! ! Thankfully, everyone was so busy eating AWESOME food and having too much fun, to take the girls bait lol! Keep up with the great work guys, and Thank you BWW!< /Text>

The lack of service here was absolutely ridiculous. I waited 1 hour they brought everybody's food and forgot mine . Then I had to wait another 30 minutes and my burger was cold when it got there. 90 minutes ?!?! That's unheard of</text>

< Review>
This review is written in regards to the customer service that is provided at this location, speficially. First and foremost, the is little to no controll over how guest are managed, seated, and attended. Hence, the chaos at the enterance of the store. I cannot seem to comprehend why there were so many open tables and booths, yet at least twenty people were standing at the door waiting to be seated: keep in mind the booths/tables open were able to fit large groups or arranged to fit a large group. The waitress seem to have little to no respect among each other, and a few are not friendly. One for example seemed to be irrated by my party, and acted as a complete a** hole. The manager of the store was spoken to, and I hope this location improves as their food is good: not great, but good. I would no recommend this location to anyone as it is unfriendly, unorganized, and dirty (to an extent).<//Review>

if I can rate this as a 0 that is what it is. the place smelled bad floor was stick with a beer smell walking to get seated. the food was dissapointing. fries were cold and hard. the screaming nacho burger more like screaming DISSAPOINTMENT. I've been to plenty of other bww with excellent service clean quick  this one is one don't recommend to go, unless you don't mind being dussapointed. management 👎 u r doing a pathetic job.< /Review>

It wasn't bust at all on the day I went but it took forever to get our drinks we had to ask another waitress to them. Took about 40 min to get our food and when we received it, it was the wrong order.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) It was crowded on weekend nights and I couldn't sit down, but the food was delicious.
The buffalo wing lemon pepper tasted good to the Japanese tongue.
Mango Habanero is extremely spicy.
