Tonight we ordered the Tuscan Garlic Chicken, the largest available... "Large". Description: "Sauce centric: our roasted garlic sauce, grilled chicken, caramelized onions, mozzarella and a drizzle of olive oil." Except they forgot the roasted garlic sauce and olive oil. You could imagine what a dry pizza tastes like. $28.50 before tax. Bland, boring and overpriced.</Text>

ToDAY my daughter went over to MARY’s Pizza, in WINDSOR, to pick up a Salad and Bread order she had placed yesterday for our Mother’s Day family dinner today…..When she got there to pick up her order, they told her that they NEVER got an order from her…..So, she showed them where they had charged her from her bank account…..so then she had to wait there while they completed the order…..With barley a sorry from the Mary’s staff…..needless to say…..we’re done with them…..when they don’t seem to value our business…...That’s MY Mother’s Day story for you….🤬< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80843e07e92b784b:0xe34c563371c48721< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Nice outdoor seating is set up for covid rules. The food we got was great. I had the lunch special, and it was better than anticipated. It wasn't something I expected to get here - a quinoa walnut cranberry arugula salad. I ordered Cesar dressing on top. It was SO fulfilling! My friend got a traditional Mary's salad and chicken tortilla soup that she has gotten for years. And of course, the fresh out of the oven breadsticks with butter. Parking is open here during the day at least and prices are reasonable.<//Text>< pics>

I arrive at this unique place every couple of days because I like the  special atmosphere that is unique to this place. The staff is extraordianrillyremarkably attentive and qualified. The service is very quick. Needless to say, the food you eat is great. I came often and I was always happy. The rate is decent. I highly suggest this place to to everybody.< /text>

<review>We ordered 2 large pizzas one Tuscan and chicken pesto with artichoke online for 7:30 pm pick up, when we got there it was not ready, the staff with manager poorly handled the situation they were looking for our order for few minutes in the system till they founded it, we got our pizzas home, pizzas has very little toppings, basically we paid $75 for bread and pesto sauce, very disappointed< /review>< Pictures>

I’ve been a fan of The Shack since I worked there as a “salad girl” many, many years ago. I always stop for a large Mary’s salad when I’m driving through the North Bay. The staff is helpful and eager to make to rectify mistakes.< /Review>

Wow my local neighborhood Mary's really let us down tonight...too busy to answer our phone call...too long to get our food...not an option for dinner with kiddos tonight and an PIC Lisa made it very clear she didn't care about us or our business!!
Well good news Windsor, lots of other options that don't include Mary's!!
Do yourselves a favor and go to a restaurant that can staff appropriately and is hungry for your business, not one that seems to act like they are doing YOU the favor if they can be bothered to take your call and make your food.
Disappointed but full from other local Windsor fare.<//review>

<Text>The pizza was excellent. Thin crust Tuscan Garlic Chicken. Our server was truly enthusiastic and really appeared to love working there. Not sure if the speedy service is the norm, but we were seated right away, and had our food within 15 minutes. Considering they had to cook 3 small pizzas I'd say that was an above average experience.<//Text>< Name>

Always a wonderful experience. The food is great and the service staff is attentive and pleasant. The Mary's organization has a very creative product development team with an excellent sense of taste. They also have, either, a Rare Superlative Talent for selecting personnel, or a set of well-considered, comprehensive and closely-followed HR Procedures that direct them to hiring, and maintaining, the very best wait staff candidates. I suspect they have both.<//Text>

Always great friendly service and awesome pizza for a good price. We usually get a salad with our pizza to make it a little healthier. The shredded carrots, mushrooms, beans, hard boiled egg, and beats that come on top of the salad make it pretty healthy and tasty. We often get the he and she meatballs during the happy hour for a great price if we're feeling extra hungry. If you have kids that are into making their own pizza, that can be a fun option too.</Review>

Great family spot! Definitely a must try when in Windsor. The service was exceptional! Kevin went above and beyond in service he provided. He's well mannered and has a great positive attitude! The pizza was awesome, savory and crispy. The salads are fresh too! We'll def be back when we come back!< /review>

We walked into an empty restaurant 45 minutes before closing and were welcomed as if we were longtime friends. He ensured that we did not over order or overspend, and took the time to understand exactly what we were looking for and make sure we got it. His friendliness absolutely blew me away. I would highly recommend visiting Mary's purely for the chance to chat with Kevin.</Text>< user>

<Response>None</Response><Text>We love Mary’s. Usually go once a week. The service is always great. But this time the food wasn’t up to their usual standards. The bread sticks were over done - pretty stiff. I ordered the Eggplant and Artichoke Sandwich. The eggplant was very over cooked and so was the bread. It was actually hard. Plus the sandwich was almost completely dry. Two very small pieces of artichoke. Luckily, I asked our server for extra artichoke and she was very sweet about providing it.</Text></record>

Been to this location quite a few times, Dining in and take out. Seems that every time things are forgotten. It also seems like (to some employees) that it's a huge burden that it's pointed out. There's been a couple of employees that are badass and have no problem helping. Food is inconsistent. Either it's perfect and pretty good, or its borderline inedible. I will say, other locations don't entirely share these problems.<//text>

<text>Unfortunately service has gone down. I place order online gave them extra 15 minutes and it is still not ready when I get their. The person trying to put it together seems very confused and rushed even thou it is only 4 in the afternoon. This has been getting worse over the last three months. I can not trust them to get the order correct when I order for delivery.

Vile. I tried to order delivery by phone and pay with a credit card for a relative who is in hospice and asked for an outside meal. They wouldn't take the order because I wasn't going to be there with a photo ID to sign the credit card receipt. What!?? Are you that antiquated that you can't figure that out? I asked if I could authorize someone to sign on my behalf and they said no. Try extreme pizza! They were friendly and curteous and able to deliver food. They also know how to use technology.<//Review>

The dough was also soggy. Meatballs were mealy and meh. Salad was a little brown and seemed as if it came out of a bag, a few days ago and the beets were dry (old).

My first visit and I am not impressed, my pizza was soggy and undercooked also seems a little over priced if I’m going to spend 20 dollars for a small two topping pizza (pick up not delivered)I expect it to be excellent especially with all the great restaurants we have here in Sonoma county I won’t be going back.<//review>

I can’t remember enjoying any bbq on the west coast more than I enjoyed KC’s. The ribs were wonderful and also enjoyed the brisket and sausage. Sides of beans, potato salad, and collards were all delicious. For those that like spicy, their spicy bbq sauce was legit. Service was a very good and felt like family. They have two cozy outdoor seats on the back patio which was pretty enjoyable. Definitely recommended!< /text>< name>

This spot is my favored. I eat in plenty of restaurants but to this one I keep coming back again and again. The team is very chummy and the cuisine they cook is so yummy. I never miss an opportunity to have a good dinner in this place. I recommend this place with pleasure.</Text>

I like this restaurant! They offer good meals, their menu is rich, The chef in that place is very experienced, I like very much trying all their food. The dishes are consistently of high class, the service towards the visitors  is very good too. I frequently visit this restaurant and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend this place.<//Review>

< Review>
I met a good friend for Sunday brunch, and while enjoying my mushroom and spinach scramble, I ordered the two-way ribs and brisket. I was unsure if we would get to eat the food that day, due to a prior family commitment. Tuesday evening, we opened the takeout platter and feasted. The meat remained fresh and flavor rich, after warming briefly in the oven. The brisket was so special and the ribs fell off the bone. The sauce is a treasure. Visit for the brunch and take home lunch!<//Review>

Good thing the food is better than the service. Upon entering the establishment and approaching the counter I'm greeted with Yeah and What. The person ordering before me received their food within 5 minutes of ordering it took another 15 minutes after watching them receive their food that the person that took my order ask me if I ordered anything!!! Been going for years and this was my 1st bad experience. Customer Service Is Key!!!<//review>

<Review>My first visit.  Tried ribs and brisket.  Ribs and bbq sauce were outstanding. Some of my brisket was a bit dry but mostly tender and juicy.  Mashed potato salad was good but flavored with dill which I don't care for.  Daily special mac and  cheese was ample, cheesy, bechamel-based and baked. I like this style of M&C better than soupy stovetop versions. Didn't try the two dinner rolls but they looked fresh.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1580065832942, 'text': 'Thank you so much for coming!

I must show love for one of the best BBQ restaurants in the Bay Area hands down. If you are in town this is a must. This places goes back to some original authentic recipes of real BBQ. It’s hard to find good soul food in the Bay Area but hands down this is one of the best in America!<//review>

<Review>It's a very cool family-run spot, but the ribs were lousy. Tough and somehow not smokey. The sauce had a good flavor but no zing whatsoever. I think they've been there forever, so I'd say maybe it was just a bad night, but there was nobody in the place, so maybe they're having a bad year. Time to get those ribs back on the rails, guys. It's not a good sign that I've driven past a number of times and never smelled smoke, including tonight. Maybe it's something to do with a clean air ordinance in Berkeley. I blame Trump.<//Review><response>None<//response><Name>Jeffrey Blumenthal</Name></record>

Old School B-town favorite, reopened here where the "Meal Ticket" use to be.
KC's is now the de-facto BBQ King of Berkeley, with better meat, better sauce, better prices,  and better staff. All hail the king!< /review>

All I can say is RIBS!!

This place has great ribs.  If you like super tender ribs, this place is for you.  The sauce is a bit tangy and sweet, which must be the Kansas City style of sauce, if so, call me a fan of KC BBQ.

Although everything else on the menu is decent, I wouldn't say it stands out as much as the ribs.  I tend to prefer the long-end ribs.  They are meatier and fattier..hehe... The times I've been here, the brisket has been either hit or miss.  The beef links were good.  You get a lot of bread to slop up the excess sauce on your plate, which is a great thing because when you have so much meat, the added starch is a welcome break.  Sides were good too.

One note of caution is that if you're not a fan of tang in your food, this might not be the best place for you<//Text>

I'm from Kansas City. These people laughed and whispered about me being trans the entire time I ate. I would've walked out but was afraid they'd make trouble for me if I didn't pay.

They wish they were Gate's, a place in KC, but they fall short. The beef is cut too thick and the portions are insulting given the price. You can get a bottle of Gate's and bake your own brisket without missing anything here.

Next time I go out it'll be somewhere with avocados, something California is actually good at preparing.<//review>

Great big load of tastey meat. Whatever I have (ribs, brisket, links or chicken) it is super enjoyable. I get a combo of two meats but even that is really hard to decide. The ribs are just great but don't underestimate anything else.</Text>

The choice for me was chicken and links. Just ok but edible. A little on the dry side. The sauce tasty but I had better. Beans just ok and potato salad need more help.

What I was taken in on were the historical pictures of African Americans from years past that decorated the walls. For me it told a story of our past here in America and how we survived those most horrible conditions and were able to come out on the other side battered, bruised but still with our dignity.

I will give them another shot at the dinner plate but will always return to receive more of that precious history that gives us the strength to move forward with our heads up.<//text>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>I was out enjoying the sun when the emotion of hunger hit my mid torso. I was on foot and just happened to be at the Bank of America on San Pablo Ave in Berkeley. Not directly across the street but within a normal persons field of vision I spot KC Barbeque and the picture of slice beef ran untethered through my hungry being. It wasn't a second thought I made my way into and ordered a slice beef dinner to go. To my palates enjoyment the beef was tender and well smoked with nice flavored edges, the sauce was delicate and sweet just enough spice paired with chunky potato salad, baked beans and three pieces of bread. Before I could make it up the block I had already slipped the most available piece of the beef from the heavy box and into my mouth at that point it hit me that this meal had to be enjoyed with a premium beer; I'm talking anyone of your local craft beers. Why? This bar-b-que was too tasty for Bud, Miller and Heineken.</review><date>1377724250259</date>< Rating>

Prices here at great. I love the fact that you can take your own uniforms and it's not expensive to place the logo. Very organized. Would just recommend for a bit more of staff.</Text>

Very nice fenced in grassy dog play area with benches and paved paths for people. The main downside is the proximity to 280 and the noise that comes with that. There is a dog fountain, but no agility features.</review>

Some of the best views of the city at night and a nice sunny, warm spot during the day. At night, go with your sweetie, take a bottle of wine and Scrabble and enjoy the view at the top of the hill. Playing on the swings is fun too (at night when the little kids are gone of course).<//text>

Decently sized grassy play area for dogs. Not too busy. Ground can get a bit muddy, so be prepared for a dirty dog after play.</Review>

This park is amazing. Fresh cute grass,huge play area for the dogs to run in. Lots of benches to sit on while you watch your dog run with the other dogs. The only issue I have is that my dog is disabled and going down the steep hill to get to the dog park is tough for him. If there was another route to take him from the recreation building entrance to the park, it would be helpful. Outside of that, it's definitely one of the best dog parks I've ever been to.<//text>

No parking anywhere. Hard to find under overpass and can’t get to it for Almeda. This is for neighborhood not people looking for dog parks.<//Text>

<review>So I've been taking outdoor Hip hop dance classes brought to you by Dance Mission Theater in San Francisco (go ahead, Google, I'll be right here). So here's the lowdown: the bathrooms are exquisitely clean so woot woot to the parks and rec folx for keeping this bathroom clean yo. So I see families with heir little Muppets in the playground. They seem to be having a great time (not sure if they're cussing each other out under their breaths, regretting having children with their partners. but that's a projection, that may or may not be mine). Two tennis courts beside a basketball court that the dance class uses. No hypodermic needles, so yay. Never been to the dog park. But I've seen some dog activities there, so it exists.<//review><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808f7ef581af79ad:0xa2a595083ce139e2</GmapID><userid>107592125092128113767<//userid></record>

Got a new pup and was excited to finally be able to take her out. This park looks great except they are closed for the winter. We were disappointed but plan to come back once it's reopened. Looked through Google and different sites and never saw any mention of the closure. Thought I'd save some people the trouble of coming here while park is closed.</review>

This is a terrific dog park. Large, well maintained, and with a tall fence around the perimeter. The fence is also in good repair. There's a water fountain with dog bowl. It's attached to St Mary's Park, a nice playground, and Alemany Farm, a cute little garden plot in the city.</text>

1 star because they cant be bothered to put a proper schedule online and when you call you may get told that the dog park is open but it actually isn't. Waste of time trying to come here.<//Text>

Second best dog park in the City (to Douglass).  Beautiful,  secluded, big.  Drainage just so-so, so closed Friday mornings and winter.< /review>

Looks like it used to be a small baseball field, now a grassy fenced dog park. Clean, with benches and a paved walkway for people. All in all a nice dog park.< /Text>

<Review>Fun dog park and you also get a great workout walking up that hill when you leave! It's big enough for dogs to run around off leash with no worries about them getting lost because it's closed off. It also  has a pokestop and a pokegym! Haha!</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808f7ef581af79ad:0xa2a595083ce139e2<//GmapID></record>

This enclosed field, is not only big enough for my 180 lb bull terrier/retriever, its so remote, yet right there. Cross the pedestrian bridge over 280 twards Alamany Farm, but don't desend cause its right there in front of you!! See.......remote🤔</Text>

(Translated by Google) Wow beautiful because it is in a good place and is very organized. My family liked that place. I've gone many times, they update it or they order it, thanks to everyone right now, it just made me sleepy. I do not lie 🤥🤥🤥

Efficient, friendly staff, upgraded our vehicle to a very nice SUV.  Offered to drive us to our car!
We returned to San Diego airport without any trouble.

Will use Carlsbad Airport location again!</review>

The rental desk location closed at 2pm ON A SATURDAY, so I had to make a second trip just to pick up my vehicle. When I picked it up, the tags were expired 3 months prior and the gas was LESS than half a tank. I'm not saying I will never rent from this agency again because it is very convenient to Oceanside.....but I would definitely think twice about choosing them.</Text>

< review>
The gal at the counter is beyond rude, no smile, non-friendly, non-helpful. Since I work full-time in Customer Service I KNOW what great service is.
The website said NOTHING about a $250 deposit PLUS I prepaid and now have to wait 3 days for a refund. Outside of the rental office not connected they have a separate Customer Service number for refunds. MARIO
is outstanding because I works at call center not their office.<//review>

<text>I have rented from this Avis for some time now and I can tell you I have NEVER received a car where the windshield that was clean, not once. This is obviously frustrating especially while Driving at night, its unsafe, please teach you people how to clean properly and have some pride in what they do. Secondly, my bill was a pay in advance and it ended up being more, the lady at the front desk was less than helpful and pointed me to your corporate phone number. Great service there, that's all I need another 30 minutes out of my life dealing with more potential headaches. If this is your master plan, well that's wonderful, I have a ton of travel plans coming up and may end up switching to Enterprise, the proverbial straw is about to break. Glad you asked about may experience...<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1601917468981, 'text': "Hello Kyle! We're so sorry to hear about your poor experience.

<review>Richard and his staff are outstanding.  You could not ask for better service with a smile. They are all very friendly. I would highly recommend renting from this location as opposed to going to San Diego or Los Angeles. The ease of getting to Carlsbad Avis office is easy and fast.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

I had rented a car on the 11th to the 12th. It was nice at first but after i had returned the car my rental price went from 83 to 103 and they are still charging me 8.33 and it has been almost a week now? This is ridiculous. They say they have no hidden fees but they do. And when i called to ask how much it would be to purchase the vehicle they told me i would get my answer and information 1 to 2 days later, i am currently still waiting for that call.<//text>

Terrible Customer Service

No one knows anything as there is no communication between other offices or call centre.

Esteban who helped us at the San Diego airport location had terrible customer service. He didn't apologize for giving us a car with maintenance issue and gave a rude attitude when he gave us the new car.

The new car was extremely dirty and smelt so bad my wife felt she would threw up. It took three cars, three locations and a nice man from the Vista, California location to replace the car.

The only reason we are giving one star is because of that man helping us.

Honestly recommend against Avis.<//Review>

<Text>I rented an SUV at our small  airport location for a one-way to Phoenix.  I usually rent from a neighborhood location, so thought it might be a hassle.  However, process was speedy and fine.

The agent had to give me a full size SUV instead of the intermediate I ordered, and I was afraid gas mileage might be an issue,  but it was no problem--gas mileage was about the same as a smaller SUV.  Car was in good shape and performed well.  Return at Phoenix Sky Harbor was easy.

I find that Avis is usually the best agency to rent from--best prices and choice of cars.</Text>< Pictures>

Richard was very pleasant and friendly, great service. Very quick, and very good rates, as well as one of the only places North of San Diego open on a Sunday. Also didn't try to sneak in unnecessary and undesired add-ons like I've seen many places do. Highly recommend, would rent from here again any time!< /text>

The Avis in Denver Colorado was terrible. It took almost 2 hours to get my car. Avis stated the computers were slow, however I could see employees clearly going to a corner of the counter and just talking. Only one representative was doing most of the work. Then to leave the parking lot only one attendant, so again long wait. Maybe they could have took some of those people who were talking in the corner and opened up a few more Lanes for people that waited two hours for their car.< /review>

Upon our return we noticed a toll charge which was surprising to us since we never use toll roads. We called Avis twice on Sunday (April 21st) and were redirected both times to the Avis toll number which didn’t seem to be working that day. Called back twice on Monday (April 22nd); the first agent gave us a partial refund and also sent us an itemized toll receipt. After I ended that call, I looked over the toll receipt and saw that we were charged for using a carpool lane. I called back and explained to the second agent that at no point were we told we couldn’t use carpool lanes and I also told her that we had verified before we took the car that there was no service fee for the toll box in the car. That agent said she would process an almost full refund. Today (April 25th) we noticed we only received the partial refund. Upon calling back today (April 25th), they said they could only see the first agent’s notes about the partial refund. I asked to speak to the supervisor and she said that she could also only see the partial refund. The fact that they would lie about not seeing the almost full refund note is ridiculous and deceitful. We will definitely not be using their services again.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80dc735d901d0fff:0x9ffb30b63d6bf35a</Gmap_id><Rate>1< /Rate><username>Kavita Brendan<//username>< time>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>Very disappointing experience trying to rent from Avis recently.
After securing a reservation, I received a voicemail stating that the Avis location I had selected had no mid-sized cars. They had one SUV, but they were going to charge me more per day, even though I had not requested an SUV.  A second call revealed that the SUV had a flat, so they had no cars.
I called the 800 number to move the reservation to a different location. That location also took my reservation despite not having any cars wither.
I called to 800 number again. Changed locations again. The price went up again.  And when I finally went to pick up my rental - surprise - they didn't have any mid-sized cars. The gentleman working offered me a Nissan Versa or a Ford Fiesta. When I refused, it turns out that they did have one Ford Focus left, but instead of the $114 reservation (up from $102) it was going to cost $153 plus taxes and surcharges. For a smaller car.
I have had trouble renting from Avis before (cars not clean, or not fully fueled) but the agents in those cases were helpful and were able to make it right.
Not the case this time. I left without a rental car at all.  Thanks for nothing, Avis.<//text>< pictures>

My son was going to be attending his high school prom and a group of them had coordinated to share a limo, but at the last minute those plans fell through.  I contacted Alfredo at Avis and he assisted me along the way to try and get a luxury vehicle without having to pay through the roof.  The limo company wanted $800.00 just for 5 hours.  Alfredo not only had a car set aside for me, he told me that if on the day of the prom, we wanted to have possibly a better choice, to contact him and he would see what he could do.  I loved the fact that the day prior, he had a 2016 Black Lincoln Navigator standing by for me and my wife to serve as a Chauffeur complete with dressing in all black for our son and his date to take pictures at a nearby park in Carlsbad, Dinner at Benihana in Carlsbad, and the prom at Paradise Falls in Oceanside.  Thank you Avis and especially Thank you Alfredo, you totally saved us!!!<//Review>< pics>

Friendly and efficient service.  Although it is at an airport, I felt like I was renting from my neighborhood store.  Cheaper than renting from SAN. Not nearly as many fees and assessments.<//review>

I love this Avis Palomar Airport location.  The staff is friendly, the car pick-up/drop-off system is the best.  I have rented from this location numerous times and have never had an issue except this time.  (2/2016)  When I got the car it seemed clean as it should be.  However, as I drove away west towards the sunset, the sunlight exposed the dirty windshield.  It was obvious the wipers had been used and the area outside the wipers had water spots. There were also two rings, as if someone placed two drinks on the windshield.  That couldn't be possible without them sliding so not sure what they were from. OK, no biggie.  Maybe the guy ran the wipers after he washed the car.  But then when I opened the back door, there was a Carl's Jr bag on the floor.  That told me someone didn't clean the car.  So then I inspected the car closer and I started noticing little dirt signs on the car exterior.  My take from this was that the guy who cleans the car may have seen that it was pretty clean and figured it was good to go.  Other than this, everything was fine.  I will still be getting my cars at Avis from this location.  This incident is isolated and has never happened before.< /review>

Terrible customer service. Reservation was for noon and the location closed at noon on Labor Day. I arrived at noon and they were closed. I called at 11 to confirm they were open and they never picked up. Three additional customers showed up after 12 to pick up cars. At no point did Avis or the employees of this location bother to notify their customers their reservations could not be filled.< /text>

Second consecutive time I had rented and the inside of the vehicle was dirty, I had to wipe it down for my wife before she would get in the vehicle. Lack of any responsibility or any care of ownership. There is another competitor in the same facility I might consider changing.<//review>

Love renting from this location because Richard is the BEST.  Okay that's not to say that the other employees aren't great as well, but Richard is the man!

What's not to love about a rental car location where you can pull up and be at the front counter within 1 minute with no waiting. Unless you're unlucky and someone happens to be ahead of you.  But usually there's no one in line.

Great selection of cars, most are one-way drop offs from other locations and states.

I've rented here more than 30 times and always get upgraded from the cheapest economy car to either full size, SUV, or sports car, depending on what they have available.

Very rarely are economy cars in stock so keep that in mind because if you absolutely do not want an upgrade because of the possible extra gas cost, then this might not be the rental location for you.

There are 3 gas stations within a couple of miles so you can wait until you get close to fill up (Chevron - right off the freeway, Shell - 1 block east of the airport, and another Shell - about 3 blocks east of the airport).</review>

The customers aren't bright.  They usually have trouble with reading the many signs, and end up leaving the car in the middle of the road in front of all the other potential rentals.

JUST PARK IN A PARKING SPACE LIKE A NORMAL PERSON, AND READ THE SIGNS</text>

<Review>I got a specialty order (shrimp chowmein) and items from behind the counter! The shrimp chowmein tasted completely burnt, the items behind the  counter well...let's just say you can't tell they leave food there until it either sales or you can visibly tell something is wrong! It was so stale and nasty I'm surprised the health dept haven't closed them down; and I'm even more surprised I didn't get food poisoning... Avoid this place Fontana have plenty of other good Chinese food spots...nothing tasty over there, just a bad taste you can't get out of your mouth!< /Review>< user>

<time>1606872143360< /time><Rating>1<//Rating><text>I am giving one star because the beef broccoli was horrible, the meat was super tough, and the teriyaki chicken was horrible quality, the rice wasn't your normal rice, it had no flavor whatsoever. The Chow Mein was only enjoyable when I put teriyaki sauce on it. I would have at least given 2 Stars maybe 3 if your customer service was on point. It was far from that.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Lots of cheap Chinese food. Nothing special to set it apart. All of the food trays looked like they'd been sitting for a long time. Also the woman paid very little attention to anything I said. No sauce on the chicken *puts sauce on*. Charge to credit *charges to debit*. And eating there was a big mistake, they keep it boiling hot. Probably to discourage people from eating in. Honestly probably won't come back. I prefer Mr. You's for consistency.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1CCdlxvDNi-9iW9C0_53tTxxEqrMdKQ95Tazz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

On Nov 4th I purchased a two combo meal, consisting of noodles, teriyaki chicken, and spicy pork. The next day after having this for lunch at work, I started getting chills and came down with a fever. The fever lasted through the next day with a temperature of 102. For the next three days, I had severe stomach cramping and diarrhea. I took a Covid test, thinking that was the reason for my illness, which was negative.Instead the lab results showed traces of shigella, comes from undercooked meat and/or contaminated feces.I will NEVER eat there EVER again. This has been the most horrific experience I've ever had with a fast food restaurant. If I could rate this a negative five stars I would.< /review>

It’s usually good, but this time I was disgusted as I was eating my food because the pork didn’t look nor taste right, and my whole combo was just off. So, I couldn’t even eat half my meal, which was very upsetting and a waste of money. I don’t think I’m going to bother with this place anymore and neither should you.<//review>

<review>FIRST AND LAST TIME GOING HERE.
I found a piece of a metal sponge 2 INCHES LONG AT LEAST.
I took a picture and will post it here!
And on Yelp!
I told the lady and said to be more careful because someone could choke.
She just said uh huh oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah ok. Really slow and like dumbfounded.

She didn't offer me my money back and didn't look like she felt bad. I didn't finish the food and tossed it.

BBQ pork was dark and tough seasoning was good. Green beans were raw af.< /review>< Pics>

Went in mid afternoon. Only two things were fresh. The mushroom chicken i wanted to get was disgusting looking like it had been there since they opened or day before. I ordered teriyaki chicken and bbq pork
Somehow they weren't dried our for a change. I only.really like the wantons here anymore they rarely mess those up. I have been coming here off and on for 20 years and it seems they are going downhill bit make money because this is Fontana and whem desperate people order whatever is available<//Text>

<Review>The amount of food they give you here is literraly double of the average, the box is full with food.

The spicy orange chicken tastes good, the triyaki chicken also. Rice is good.

The only cons: the pasta tend to be overcooked a little bit(at least for my taste).

I came around noon, and the food was ready, and payed 6.75 for a mega plate.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Stay far away from this place I was sick for a week because of a swollen lymph node on my right side. My throat, ear and head was hurting so bad I went to the doctors 2xs and the 2nd  doctor said it was caused by someone not washing their hands when preparing food. I will never ever ever go back there, just nasty ass hell 🤢🤮🤬...I wish I could give them 5 of these 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕instead of 1 star< /review>

Well here, you pay less and get more. And I mean they fill the box to the brim with your order. Literally they can't give you any more because the box is barely holding itself closed they give you so much. The food itself? It's what you expect. If we say the base line of cheap chinese food is a 5/10, this place is a 6.5/10. It's just better than the rest.

What else do you want? It's cheap, they overfill the box with food, and it tastes better than any other chinese food on it's level. Unless you are one of those nerds that complains about the quality of a McDonalds patty, you'll be pleasantly suprised with this place.<//review><rate>4<//rate>< Time>

<review>If I could give this negative stars I would, just for the sake of your tummy stay far away from this place.  Hands down the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  We left most of the food at the table and left.  Never done that anywhere before.  Rude service, cold, tasteless food.  Gross.
Just to give you people out there a heads up, all of our food was either raw or undercooked. Go home expecting to have food poisoning the next morning.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c34c5e45b6493f:0x3ed24ec168ead0b0< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I was very nervous coming in because typically I get anxiety with dentist. However, I was provided great customer service. Abel was super attentive and explained the procedure along the way. The female dentist gave me different options for the my procedure. Overall I will definitely return to this location.</Text>

<Text>Finally a dentist that will listen to what you have to say. I know I need a lot of dental work I don't need somebody handing me a $40,000 bill on my first visit.The doctor was awesome she listened to me, we came up with a plan that was absolutely going to work, her staff was quick with x-rays  and the place is incredibly clean ,I think I'll be coming here for a while.</Text>< time>

<Text>I was extremely disappointed with the service provided by dentist and Hygienist! They are not considerate about the patients needs and just looking for a way to make money on patient. They say all the good things to get you come in and when u get there the treatment plan is thousands of dollars. Yes payment plans Are available however you better have most of the money upfront. I was disappointed 😔</Text><pics>None<//pics></record>

<review>Came here as an emergency for a broken/infected tooth. They were able to squeeze me into their busy schedule and be seen. Friendly front desk ladies and doctors were knowledgeable of what I had going on. As a result I continued to use them to undergo my cavity treatments and root canels. Everything was smooth to the point, doctors works so well on my treatments. If seen all 3 of them, each with their own style but very good at what they do. I am currently in the process of getting braces as well!!<//review><rate>5<//rate>< Name>

<Review>Dr Tran, Dr Nguyen, and Tony, treated me like a long lost friend. Reyna coordinated it all. A year and a half had gone by since the last visit and they remembered particulars that l forgot we had discussed. The did a fast and efficient repair on my broken denture and I could not be any more pleased with results. Thank you!< /Review>< Date>

They lied to me and told me, that my insurance didn’t cover the whole payment for a deep cleaning and asked me to pay 200 dollars for the portion that wasn’t covered, which thankfully I found out was a total lie, and in actuality it was fully covered, and Orange Family Dental was trying to make extra money off of me. When I confronted them, they lied about some type of an injection that I as getting, without my knowledge of an injection at all (what!!?? Why?!??! And where!??!) and again they said I had an infection, which was another lie, and supposedly they needed the 200 dollars for that. It’s disappointing and disgusting that such establishments exist. Thankfully I was informed, I can’t imagine who else they’re taking advantage of, especially being in a inner city area. I pray for the lady who sits in the front desk, because she’s the biggest lier of em’ All... disgusted by there action. Saddens me how corrupt people are.</review>

I moved away for a couple years and had horrible experiences at other Dental offices where they bullied me into accepting unnecessary treatments at a high price. This experience made me appreciate Orange Family Dental even more!

Dr. Tran and his staff will tell it to you straight and work with you to make your dental health a priority, at a reasonable price.

I highly recommend Orange Family Dental to anyone looking for a true "Family" friendly dental office and environment.<//Review><user>102208254954036680050</user><Date>1501130000632< /Date></record></dataset><record>

I have been visited Doctor Tran for more than 15 years. He is very intelligent and kindly doctor,  as I liked his great experience in service. Before, I came to receive his services I checked out 3 difference dentists and I decided back to him with his judges my issued matched with other doctors. Therefore, I trust doctor Tran in my service.
Plus, he has a great assistant statff with is special Tony, is great assistant and service long time in OC dentistry.<//Review>

<review>Awesome place to buy roasted duck! Parking really sucks (at least on the weekends when I go). They are CASH ONLY. That's the only draw back, but in all of Souther california, I highly recommend this place!< /review>< pics>

They have the best Peking duck around . It’s definitely worth it. The service however is terrible. They are extremely rude and abrasive. Ask them any question and it’s like you insulted them. They will say they are out of something and give it to the person in line. It didn’t seem isolated, almost Every customer in line got treated with their share of rudeness. Make sure you know it’s cash only or they will get mad that you didn’t see the small sign.</Review>

Came here 15 mins before closing to get half a duck. It was so juicy and flavorful. The lady at the register was kinda rude though. Also, make sure to bring cash! There's plenty of parking since it's located in a plaza<//text>

< Review>
Gianné did a PHENOMENAL job! I have been debating cutting all my hair off for AGES. And here I am, happier then ever with the experience I had at Luxelab with Gianné. From start to finish it was a five star experience, from genuine and friendly conversation, thorough consultation and the environment in general was wonderful. I can’t wait to continue to implement the product Gianné recommended for me in my styling routine and return for my next appointment with her in 7 weeks!<//Review>

Luxelab is open and on top of their game! It was so lovely to see owner Jason Lara and get a killer cut. The salon is super clean and has excellent CV19 protocols in place (disentfecting, social distancing, masks, check out process, etc). No more home bangs maintenance or having to do home coloring... make your appointment now!<//review>

< review>
Was able to get in on a Sunday afternoon, after someone cancelled. I like the location, the feel, and set up. I don't think the lady that cut my hair, is at the level of the prices charged. Be prepared to be Shocked!!! Hilites, haircut and style, was $440! I would expect the stylist to do a far greater job, w/even hilites (not rushing and washing out the color tint, after only a few mins. They all faded out after 2 washes), not missing hairs that may have been behind my mask, and listening to what it is my concerns are and what I'd like. I did send a message to her a few days after the initial visit, and she had me come back in. But, didn't listen to a word I said, and did the opposite of what we discussed.< /review>

<user_name>Kathy Day< /user_name><review>So happy they are open again!!!  Was concerned about getting my hair cut so early in the reopening phase, but was quickly relieved when I saw the safety measures put in place - social distancing, continual disinfecting, hands free checkout - total awareness of safety concerns.  And of course, same great service and excellent haircut!  Thank you Jason!</review></record>

<Review>Before talking about my experience, you need to know my backstory. I’ve been traumatized by previous hairstylists who get scissor happy when they see my length.. which had me IN SOBBING TEARS by the time I left. Because of this, I’ve been sticking to one hair dresser for years.. unfortunately that person is back in Detroit and I’m here in LA. After having multiple hair appointments booked, as I contemplated where I would go, this phone call I made to Luxelab made my decision easy. The sweet girl who answered the phone (really short blonde hair at front desk) took her time to address what I was looking for and who would be best for my visit. Getting to know clients and tailor treatments to their needs (BEFORE I WALK IN) was unlike anything ANY SALON has ever done. She made sure to book me with the right stylist. She introduced me to the Picasso of hairstylists and he immediately put all my traumas to rest. I like to call him Picasso because of his unmatched talent (and passion), but he goes by Orlando. WHAT A GAME CHANGER. His sweet assistant and him greeted me at the door and got to know me before even touching my hair. They walked me through everything they were doing and even recommended what would best suit my hair needs without trying to sell me. THIS IS WHERE YOU NEED TO BE!! Never going anywhere ever again.. unless Orlando does, I’ll be following. I wish I could rate more than five stars😭❤️</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>Excellent. Great place got men's cuts and other services. With several options of extraordinary stylists, you should be able to generally find someone you like. This is good example of a mid to high range salon that is worth the wait. And then afterward treat yourself to a visit of 3rd Street Promenade just down the block.<//review><Name>Thai Nguyen</Name></record>

Walkin Client, I found Craig’s bio online and booked him. He was attentive, fast and gave me the best cut I’ve ever had, besides my stylist of 30 years. I would recommend this salon and Craig without reservation.< /review>

In town for business, I forgot the product I normally use for my hair and the girls were super friendly and helpful. Britney helped me choose a product and even styled it in for me while she had a few minutes before her next appointment. Thanks Britney!</text>

<Review>I lived in Los Angeles for over a year, bouncing around from salon to salon, until I found Jason and Ashley at LuxeLab. I love everything about coming here, from the convenient location (with plenty of street parking and cute shops nearby) to the products they use. I haven’t just had great haircuts here – I’ve learned how to better take care of my hair. Jason came up with a clear plan to get my hair to a place that I love (and keep it healthy and a great fit for my busy lifestyle). The salon’s commitment to sustainability is just another amazing aspect (and one that so many salons ignore). The team is welcoming, the space is beautiful and modern, and I’m so happy I found this spot!</Review>< pictures>

I initially discovered this salon because it was walking distance to my home when I move to LA. I've now been going there for almost 5 years, and have always left happy. The stylists are knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating. The environment is laid back and relaxing.< /Text>

Jen was AMAZING. First off, I'm a dude, a REAL dude, not an LA dude, so for me to really dig a haircut, it's gotta be something special. I can honestly say she gave me the best haircut I've ever had.<//text>

Found our go-to place for Poke in the Sacramento area. You can't beat the portions and prices for the poke you get. 4 scoops of protein for only $13.95 or $8.95 for the vegan option with 3 scoops of tofu. The fish is so fresh and the variety of toppings you can get surpasses other poke places I've been to. Plus you can build your bowl with the choice of two bases, two sauces, etc. Nice convenient online ordering directly through their website too.<//Text>

First time here, was greeted by friendly staff. Ordered a pair of large bowls. Big plus is the avocado is actually sliced and not mashed. the location is clean and cozy. A little pricey but they have more toppings and are more generous than most other poke places. Will definitely be visiting again.< /Review>

I had spicy tuna and spicy salmon with brown rice and a whole bunch of toppings. It was delicious! Fish tasted fresh, i didnt detect any slimyness that old fish tend to have, and the miso dressing was a good choice. I plan on coming back for my poke fix!<//Review>

<Review>I have ordered from here about 4 times in the last 2 weeks and have always been fine, but yesterday I ordered a bowl with salmon in it and have severe food poisoning now. I didn’t get any sleep because I was up all night vomiting from both ends. I don’t know if the salmon accidentally got left out or what but needless to say I am terrified to eat poke or sushi ever again< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x809add40b31e1b3d:0x408acd28e5e52628</gmapID></record>

Definitely up there as far as poke places (although I've only been to 6 different poke places across NorCal).

Base: daikon salad was really interesting, almost like seaweed noodles except the texture was less crunchy and definitely more flavorful. They also added a bit of seasoning I think, which was really nice.

Fish: spicy salmon: not really spicy and the marinade wasn't very flavorful but otherwise had above-average freshness.

Toppings: they are generous with the toppings, I can't believe masago doesn't cost extra! The size that the cucumbers were cut into offered a much better mouth feel than other places. No comment on the other toppings.

Sauces: ohhhh boy the garlic miso was solid, not too sweet not too salty. I could eat it by the spoonful.

House shoyu was good too, I'm not knowledgeable enough about shoyu to have a good comment though.

Overall this meal was fantastic and only $15 including tax for 4 scoops it's a relatively good deal. The highlight of this bowl was that it wasn't overly sweet like other poke places (a lot of poke places go to the more creamy/sweet side of things due to the standard American palate).<//Review>

Their contactless pick-up/ordering is very conveniently set up. The fish was good and I personally love having fruit in my poke so the fresh pineapple and mango was a lovely treat! Their menu is also very reasonably priced for the area & amount.<//Review>

We only serve fresh tuna here and these tuna are shipped directly from Hawaii's fish auction.

<text>This place never disappoints when you're in the mood for some delicious clean food that isn't too heavy. I would buy the miso garlic sauce by itself if they bottled it, it's so good. I was hesitant to try all of the toppings at first, I thought mango would be weird but everything works together! I load up on everything each time I go now. Great food.<//text><rate>5< /rate></record>

<Review>Lost a star bc mainlanders need to stop spelling poke with an accent mark over the e for real, doesn’t exist in the Hawaiian language. HOWEVER, this was one of the few places I’ve been to that actually has poke (marinated fish) and wasn’t just a fish salad bar. And the fish quality was good and fresh!<//Review>< resp>

My wife and I were hard-pressed for time when we decided to stop by here for a quick lunch prior to a meeting in the area.  The food here was delicious!  I was surprised that the rice they use is warm.  All the other similarly styled restaurants we've eaten at use cold rice.  I can't say I have a preference on my rice being warm or cold since the ahi tuna itself is cold, but it stood out as worth mentioning.  I will definitely stop in again when in the region.< /review>

Average Poke, not bad nor great. Had the small poke bowl which comes with three proteins. Had the spicy salmon (good), spicy tuna (good) and spicy tako (seemed old). Would I go back, sure. Would I recommend it, maybe.< /Review>

This place is just slightly more expensive compared to the guys in Fair oaks I've been going to but it seems like it's worth that difference. The staff were all friendly and polite, food was good and the location is definitely convenient.<//Review>< Pictures>

Love their bowls! Their sauces tastes better than the other poke place in Folsom. David is the best server, first time seeing him here but it's been a while... He was so courteous, friendly, professional and a hard worker! Great job David! Hope your employer gives you Kudos! You deserve it!< /Review>

This place was not bad. It's always important to try to find the right combination and each poke place is a little different when it comes to ingredients. Each one is trying to be unique in their own way. The fish was fresh and the gredients were pretty much similar to any other poke place. There was nothing exceptional about this place that made it stand out. But, the food tasted fresh and flavorful. I would come back if I was in the area.< /Review>

<Text>This vegan was able to create a tofu poke bowl that was on SO good! I would have given them 5 stars if my delicious vegan bowl was cheaper than my neighbor's salmon poké bowl.

Not so many options here, fish looked like it had been out for a while, no recommendations for sauce combos, and they loaded my bowl with spicy mayo.
Same price, same portions and after this first poke cube bowl, id rather make the drive to Folsom fishology.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>OMgosh, I have been waiting for a great poke place to open near me in Rancho Cordova, I have been to the place in Folsom, but here at Poke Cube the fish is fresh not frozen, more options, heavy servings and the staff was great. Can't wait to go back. Try the Shoyu Tuna and the garlic shrimp.<//Text><name>Nichole Wolfe< /name>< Response>

Delicious healthy food! It's not too heavy like traditional Indian food. I smashed an appetizer, entree, and dessert but still walked away guilt free and not feeling bloated. The flavors are just as good as traditional Indian food and the fusion aspect adds a fresh plot twist. I highly recommend.<//Text>

Phenomenal food, with a particular emphasis on customer service. The owner/server, Ashok, cooks up and serves incredibly innovative fusion dishes. Ask him to surprise you - you will not be disappointed!<//Review>

<review>Absolutely fantastic, I highly recommend this place. I had the sea bass enchiladas and it was the best fish I think I've ever had. The owner comes to your table and goes over everything with you, let's you know that everything is customizable to the point where I just told him I wanted seafood and he ordered for me. Come here!< /review>< pictures>

Had been there about 9 years back. The owner simply asked if we had been there before. That was our first time there. He just asked couple of questions to ascertain our tastes. And in some time produced two mind blowing dishes the taste of which I'm not able to forget even now...long after I even moved out of the country.< /review>

<Review>Ordered Basmati Trio rice plate and Avatar’s dream, through Uber Eats.

The trio in the rice plate is vegetable, chicken and lamb along with rice. It just tasted like rice in a spicy water mix with big pieces of vegetable and chicken and ground lamb.

Avatar’s Dream was really yummy, with a lot of sweet flavors with mango sauce being the most overpowering for me.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Text>Food: The dishes were very tasty! I loved their idea that us customers should use creativity to design our own dishes. You can practically make their dishes your very own by adjusting spice levels, oil levels, and more.

Service: OUTSTANDING! The workers were super polite, friendly, humorous, outgoing, and thoughtful. You be sure to feel at ease there.

Note: The only reasons why I had to take off a star was because of the excessive burnt sections. Some of the veggies were quite uncooked (which is fine) but the outside was covered in black! Of course, if you are okay with the charred food, you will thoroughly enjoy Avatar’s! :)<//Text><user_id>103263371226567486743< /user_id>< date>

Stumbled upon this gem after doing tourist things at Golden Gate Bridge. Indian curry in an enchilada isn't a combination that I knew I wanted until I tried it. And their signature dessert is out of this world. I cannot recommend Avatar's enough! I'll be sure to stop by this place every time I visit San Francisco.< /Text>

Great food and Indian and Mexican fusion worked out really well. Food is not spicy plus the owners makes sure to customize it to your taste.
Must try for those who want to explore Indian food without being afraid of curry spices. Great fusion food for those who like Indian food.</Text>

We stopped here while we were driving through the area.   I've had Avatar's Punjabi burrito before and thought it was ok, but not as good as Curry Up Now.   I found the enchiladas we ordered at this location quite excellent and look forward to coming back.

We had the smoked eggplant and mixed vegetables, both of which were good and had different sauces and thus pretty different tastes (and it isn't weird to order both for the same table). They are smothered in sauce so it isn't the easiest to eat as takeout.

We also ordered the mushrooms appetizer and some fries (for the kid) and neither of these dishes were things I would want to order again.  The fries were too soft and the mushrooms far too oily.< /Review>

An Indian fusion type of food. Very friendly owner who explains the menu and also provides suggestions with changes depending on your taste and preference. The downside was I found the food oily. I eat out quite a bit and this was a little too oily for my taste.  The curries especially. The pasta dishes were excellent. Not so much oil and perfect. Samosa was awesome too. The chai was so-so. Will definitely visit again but would avoid the curries probably.<//review>

The vegetarian ravioli was pretty good and the Punjabi enchilada was different and tasty. Our host challenged us to guess the vegetable used in the enchilada...which was really fun. The only disappointment was the dessert.< /Review>< Pictures>

Great family restaurant. They beat my expectations by how good the hospitality was. The host instantly builds a relationship with everyone by engaging himself. The food is prepared well and the dishes are presented in a artsy way that you would likely find at Michelin star restaurants. The dessert was by far my favorite course. This place is a must try if you like indian fusion food!< /text>

<text>The enchiladas were pretty darn good as was the mango shake. The rice was a little on the bland-side, but the MUST were the Samosas!!!! Very good!

The staff were very kind and seemed to know many of the patrons (assuming they’re regulars). It was busy when I arrived and I was quoted a 20 minute wait time on my to-go order and they had it ready exactly 20 minutes later.< /text>< Pics>

Rather than buying food from large corporations, support local small business and give Avatar’s the chance it deserves. The owner and the rest of the team treat you as family. They happily serve you creative ethnic dishes made with so much love and flavor...you will return! Bring your friends and family too. They are very accommodating with vegetarian and non-vegetarian options as well as gluten free and dairy free options.< /review>

<Review>This is a restaurant in Sausalito. They have a no oil no glutten menu. We were a group of vegetarians and the menu was customized to us. The food was simply amazing. I can't remember the items we had. But every single item we ate was super yum. The chai was great.<//Review><GmapID>0x808585050d11d18d:0xe1d770086a096be<//GmapID><time>1515904890809<//time><user_id>101061709463446947021<//user_id><username>Raghav Ayyamani<//username><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcxbQPe1rxziyK0ZEbbK-1Y-2SwqF4aAuXE7j_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7mvC4eVwzsPnDvEoKDcKbrTMIRY3L9Aln1UzK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< rate>

<text>We had heard alot about this restaurant and we finally made it. Do try their Samosa and butter chicken enchilada. The lady owner is very kind and she makes custom dishes for people who have dietary constraints.loved the warmth of the restaurant. However, one pointer is, be early if you're heading for a peak time. It gets crowded really quick.< /text>< time>

<review>An absolute Bay Area favorite! The owner is definitely one of the highlights of this restaurant. If you are a new customer and are unsure on what to order the owner is more than willing to surprise you with some dishes according to your taste preference. This place is the perfect balance of Indian and fusion flavors. Make sure not to miss the enchiladas! The last time I visited I had the  spinach fettuccini that was amazingly delicious. The pasta made in house with spinach, millet flour and mustard greens, so creative and tasty!< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoE05zn_fdzRNorypNGKRDtTu0ocxl37xf9W7-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEZSDWCX5CbrjXICzTU4kimRXfdIVePW6WZpvf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x808585050d11d18d:0xe1d770086a096be<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>The best thing about this place is the owner - chef. He maintains it a point to go and talk to each customer and offer his recommendations.
He made the conversation so interesting, throwing in quizzes to guess the ingredients in lieu of free food, which of course we couldn't win.
In the end he also gave us some free vegetables from his kitchen garden which are not easy to find in US.
Amazing Vegetarian Food, You don't even need to look at the menu, he will take it upon himself to make something new exclusively for u..

This is the art of marketing by winning hearts!<//review>< Date>

Insanely good! When you first look at the menu you may be puzzled about how this experience is going to be - Mexican mixed with Indian? Italian mixed with Indian?

Be brave and order on! The flavors are beyond delicious: balanced, unique, a melange of authenticity.

We had lentil soup and samosas to start (the best I’ve ever had), then prawn curry and lamb enchiladas with pumpkin and mole. WOW cannot wait to come back!</text>

I really loved the fusion food served at Avatar's - full of taste, care, smile and happiness. The reason I say all of this is because not just the food but our entire experience at this restaurant was amazing.

Ashok, the owner cum chef of the restaurant was very welcoming, walked us through his specialities and why he used certain ingredients and why he did not. He offered us the freedom to be able to customize the dishes to our taste and health choices - like protein, carbs etc.

We ordered Jerky Chicken dish which was more inclined towards Jamaican cuisine. We also order ground lamb enchiladas which was a combination of Indian and Mexican flavor. Both the dishes were very tasty and we relished every bit of it.

The restaurant has decent sized free parking lot available in front of it.

Prices are appropriate for the taste that you get here. The owner cum chef has definitely put in a lot of effort to customize the dishes and create an amazing blend of Jamaican, Mexican and Indian flavors.

I would definitely recommend you to try out Avatar's! In Ashok's words, it might be one of the best food you ever had!

<text>Chose this place from a google maps search for vegan fare, but never could have expect the experience we received!

The owner, asked what we wanted to eat and then told us to throw out the menu, then proceeded to order for us based on what we were looking for! We got two exceptional vegan dishes, that were absolutely amazing and better than what I would have chose.

<Text>Well, I know lots of people love this place, but do be careful of what you order. Food is quite rich by American standards and too less by Indian standards. That said, service is ultra quick and the owner is very polite and helpful. Would be nice if they stock more varieties of beer, instead of the Taj Mahal brand they stock....Which incidentally is not available in India! They also have just one sweet dish.... no choice available. Seating is congested and you do have to wait for sometime to get a place, even during less busy times.</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOu9KgoU7mlxivb8njlsNnw_3swHktXE1Z6vPRd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtwEzT636MERrvNosCapwDqgJ2Cz8N1rV84vns=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOeCdHiziNf3cR7vUMjvJ7pzvVhI_xm9PNo-3c4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOJBXBG0MgmedfGWGZLGEXkFlybrsH5Vbc_w7X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNucXIRfd681qrPgH3EaUi7ldZeO2Ksxq3VHi2r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMrSmIhck3_bi8e6-Krj8dGM7mY11n1qwknoipT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSoxdgMuD71vFpWR4GBGy02r6wwLmV11mwEMOo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMFjCDjY1Qae2prR2pEGOR_munBx7qZtplxVZIb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGjctECR7HK7g3bOh9RD1jBORVfkc69OPpGmYf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzFTnbDwjlv9O_alYmEXUYSTXh9i29Uh_13bOP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8ApLRo2DV50kubDngPAArV2HIyT_C1FLTGCVG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOYJ3m67errWwCM87A8DfkEVG4DRsCiBVjQkuNo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9tvERst1DnK2q7cbGhs7OsG2w2zQ8Hx1PxTaf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYlaYoX8huH9PtdOVjmlv9Xh_zmQlhv6q2ORGP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEGjojoS4IJHIoEZtXN8-YH9a18bwo_XXL8tYm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORk4tK2xJvAca93f6tv285XnkJiv5Fdc0zhHn_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEAcNfaK7XZ-6MQC59MdeQvDYkQt9072KtKT-G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyMNPqHYJLa4GPCc9gMESAu8nfUcUCU31MMnQ0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8YsTDMqo8C53dc0Ec86yYTs0rQZOTKhtzxQca=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObvAJNnBW5GEYLPd3yUgq-X0SU5uV9I49skO5V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Nice Indian restaurant with a twist. We went after it was mentioned in the Check please (KQED) program. The offer a couple traditional Indian appetizers, like Samosa. The entrees have both a Mexican twist, i.e., chicken enchiladas but the spicing is all Indian. The Italian style entrees are Indian entrees served on a bed of zucchini spaghetti, etc. But the kicker is actually different, the chef/owner of the place asks if he can bring entrees of his choice. Three vegetarians on the table went with that option - they were quite happy with the selection. I went with the chicken enchiladas, very good interesting flavors - Indian, plus traditional Mexican flavors and the side rice is Indian style. The owner makes a fun game out of the chef's choice entrees - he asks you to guess what the vegetables are, if you get all of them right the entire meal is free! I don't know if anyone got all right, we gave up about 30% of the way.

The place is a bit small, so cozy is the word. It can get crowded. Note in Google maps directions - it asks you to take that last right and claims.you've arrived... Not really you have to turn into the strip and the 3rd place is Avatar's.

Bottom line, worth a visit.</review>

They have only one dessert item because they said this is the only item they need to have, and the slice of cake is really the only dessert I would ever want there.< /Text>< Pictures>

<name>Rishi Singhal< /name><text>The food is quite Mexican tasting. It's good fusion of two different cuisines but overall I found the taste just okay. If you are looking for authentic Indian food I won't suggest this place but if you are in mood to try something different than it's a good option. The host indulges you in small talks about uniqueness of the food but the taste didn't do justice to the explanation.</text>< user_id>

Very quick service at lunchtime; ordered Chicken curry, medium spicy, and it was very good! Will order spicier next time, but only because I like spicy foods a lot.
Friend I was with ordered jerk chicken salad, and she enjoyed it as well.</Text>

<Review>Amazing twist to conventional Indian cuisine. I like going here after every 5-6 months (mainly because it is a bit far from South Bay) to revisit this innovative way of mixing up Indian dishes. The best thing is that there is no compromise to the taste at all. The dishes are well thought of and the final outcome is delicious. Enchiladas were best. If having an amazing meal in a quick time is your metric, you’re going to love it here. The owner is enthusiastic and provides lots of inputs, but can hurry you into ordering at times. The ambience is just alright for a joint in the upscale neighborhood of Sausalito, can certainly go through an uplift.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaQVDjHFByzClovY-UtDcYj7fkjUuEfTBSRYWo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x808585050d11d18d:0xe1d770086a096be< /Gmap_id></record>

<Review>I've been to this place twice since I work close to it each time the food is fair. Tonight I ordered lamb and rice and prawns. The cost of the prawns of $12.95 I only received three prawns unbelievable. The lamb is cheap not high quality grisly. The takeout leaked all over the bag for they don't focus on how to bag up take out so be careful it will leak all over.<//Review><GmapID>0x808585050d11d18d:0xe1d770086a096be<//GmapID></record>

Delicious and fresh food and quite a unique host. He recognized we were an Indian family and challenged us to let him choose what we ate, and he had good reason to be sure of himself. I'm not from the area but I'd like to come back whenever I'm passing through.</text>

I just saw the story on KTVU about the owner giving free meals to people the day before Thanksgiving. I have never eaten here but I want to say this brings tears to my eyes you are a beautiful human being and I cherish people like you. I wish There were more people in the world that take care of the human race the way you do. You are an amazing person and I just want to say I love you even though I do not even know you. You are a gem thank you for everything you do for us and the community.</review>

<text>Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. From the vegetable samosas to the chicken curry to the mango lassi, not one item was a disappointment. The vegetable samosas were perfectly crispy and flavorful and the sauce was a great tangy/spicy complement. The white meat chicken was juicy and absorbed the curry. The mango lassi was so unique and incredibly tasty.
Lastly, we chose to get the one dessert Avatar offers, which is a slice of gelato cake with a biscuit crust garnished with whole pistachios. I am so glad I opted for the dessert because it's actually one of the best desserts I've ever had. The total came out to about $36 for two people.

Not a single complaint for Avatar's. Probably one of the best restaurants and the price ($$) was very reasonable. Would absolutely come back again no doubt about that.< /text><Resp>{'time': 1561158695406, 'text': 'Thank you so much for this amazing review!

We ordered vegan food, dirty place with lots of cross contamination. We asked for recommendations for our little kid and he said he can just share with you. Luckily I read a few reviews while he was working on our order and ordered a small side for my son. Samosa was cold on the inside and hot outside. Server/owner touches food while taking orders. We are used to bad Bay Area Indian food and this food is very much on par or maybe lower. Just drive a few miles out to SF.</text><user_name>Aarthi Gunnupuri< /user_name><Rate>1<//Rate>< gmapID>

The owner of this restaurant is such a treat! This cozy space is decorated with absolutely gorgeous photography. The dishes I tried were lovely, clearly made from scratch with so much flavor. It's a.great option for vegans and vegetarians. Order the chef's special vegan dish - you won't regret it!<//Text>

If you have any dietary issues the owner is a nutritionist and can guide through the menu or create something within your restrictions that will blow your mind! He is very accommodating and makes you feel like family. Jerk chicken enchiladas are my favorite and do not skip the samosas! Amazing!</review>< username>

5 of us went there over the labor day weekend. Overall I'd say the food is good but not great. The concept is interesting... it's basically Indian fused with classic Mexican and Italian dishes. The owner certainly tries his best to provide a memorable experience, but he came across as a bit overwhelming at times and perhaps oversold his ideas.

If you're looking for great Indian food, there are a number of other places in the bay area that are beyond amazing. As a novelty experience this is worth a try.< /Text>

I made a reservation in advance before arriving. Encountered a small place with very limited seating. I was seated at the counter right in front of the kitchen and stove where all the meals were prepared. This was very interesting to me since I was able to see food cooked and plated, and the extraordinary amount of coordination this operation takes. I was disappointed by how eagerly patrons were admitted into the restaurant even when there seemed to be no space, not to already mention how it seemed there were not enough staff to handle the patrons they were already feverishly serving. It was something to experience once but I will not be back unless they either acquire a larger venue or develop a process to better handle the flow of seating and serving of patrons.< /review>

The curry was on point!   The pupadom was a little to peppery for me!   And the rock shrimp appetizer wasn't  rock shrimp  and the chutney was cooked and not fresh like it says on the menu!   It still tasted ok!  But if he actually grilled rock shrimp and tossed it with the fresh ingredients it would be amazing!

Next time I go I will bring my fresh Indian mint chutney and show him what's possible!!   I enjoyed talking with him  and look forward to going  back!!< /text>

Jamaican Jerk Chicken Enchiladas with habaneros from Indian restaurant.
BOOM!
Mind blown.
Plus friendly and efficient wait staff. Plus exraordinary black and white photography on the walls.
Reasonably priced for the area.

<Text>The place has an interesting take on Indian cuisine. I had a fettuccine pasta made in eggplant gravy with big shrimps. It was delicious. But then the proprietor said he would give us french bread alongside which we presumed was on the house because there was no French bread on the menu. And we got the bread when we were about done with the pasta. To top it all, when we got the check,  it was handwritten and nobody in their right mind could comprehend what was written in it. So I asked the waiter and he explained that they had charged for the bread as well. And I had no idea how much tax I paid.
In short,  the food here is great but the service can be improved tremendously.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

This place not only had delicious food, but the staff was super friendly. My party had someone with a dairy and gluten allergy, and the wait staff was very cognizant of that and the menu offered several options for him. We left extremely satisfied and happy with our meal. If only we lived here, we'd be at Avatar's all the time. Will definitely come back if we're ever in the area.</review>

This is an Indian restaurant with a fusion of other California influences such as Mexican.  The owner has a flamboyant personality and hosts every table, and we'll try to persuade you to not look at the menu but instead trust his judgment accept his plates.  Several vegetarian options.</text>

<review>Probably one of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been to. Amazing owner who really has a passion for what he does. Creative approach to authentic Indian food. I have no doubt that everything on the menu is going to taste great. My friends from SF showed this place to me when I was visiting from Virginia. Will definitely be coming again when I'm back in town.</review>< Rate>

One of the best fusion restaurants in the Bay area. A mix between Indian, Italian and Mexican this place is definitely a must-go for every foodie.
The host is very kind and generous. Food is really really good.<//Review>

Owner is awesome and prepared very interesting & tasty vegetarian fusion food (enchilladas & ravioli) for us using healthy cooking techniques and ingredients. Great place for vegetarians. Also liked their vegan & sugarfree special dessert, although a bit pricey was yummy !< /Review>

<Text>Love this place.  We heard from the owner that this place has been in this location for 30 years.  We had some co-workers visiting from Singapore, they loved it so much they came back at least 4 times during their stay, and yes, I tagged along.  Tips for people who hates reading the menu (like me), just  tell them what meat or veggies you like and what to avoid, they will whip up something amazing.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1551036452809, 'text': 'Thank you for introducing us to your guests, Eddie!

<Review>Do not go here expecting Indian food. It is "fusion" between Indian and other cuisines - Mexican, Jamican, Italian... Nice concept but the execution would have been much better. We tried based on the reviews but felt that the food did not live up to the expectations set by the reviews.
Service is attentive and the restaurant is clean.<//Review>< user_id>

I have eaten twice at Avatar’s Sausalido restaurant, once alone and the second time with family.
This is one of the best and most authentic Indian restaurants I have ever experienced in US. Avatar’s is the one of the cheapest and most famous restaurants.
The owner of the restaurant is a very friendly and jolly person. If he is present at the restaurant, you should definitely have a chat with him.<//text>

Food was very flavorful and served hot.  Place is small and was very busy on a Saturday night. Sat at the bar and watched the food being prepared. It all looked very well presented and delicious.  The lines was out of the door, which wasn't surprising. Will definitely be back.< /text>

Amazing food. Best Indian fusion I’ve eaten so far. The quantity was less though. Ask for any out of band menu items and they would be welcome to serve/suggest. Great sea food enchiladas. The owner personally greeted us and spoke to us. Super super friendly. Can be a bit crowded though.</review>

The food is very tasty and can easily be custom ordered to accommodate individual dietary needs and preferences.
It is a little more expensive than I would be able to spend everyday, but is a very nice treat once in a while! Only price prevents me from giving 5 stars. the food is definitely 5 stars quality.
chairs are very comfortable and unique in design.< /text>

Fusion is not for me. I like Authentic Indian Food. I liked the presentation of the food the exuberance of the manager cum owner and the positive energy of the place. Taste of my meal was okay. A bit cramped for my liking but definitely a must try for the place and location it's at. I wish them Good Luck for trying to take the initiative to try something different.< /Review>

I have been coming to Avatar's since I can remember. Their Punjabi Enchiladas are to die for! The yogurt sauce is so delicious. Everything is absolutely amazing and I always leave feeling full and happy. The service is very excellent also. Overall, a very awesome Indian food place to eat at!</Text>

Always great food and great service. You gotta love the owner of the company telling you to not even look at the menu and just ask you what you like and he will prepare something. Okay place in terms of ambiance.  Gave it 5 stars because of the food.<//Review>

Awesome experience in this wonderful restaurant in Sausalito!!! Probably one of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been to in terms of creativity. The mixed cuisine approach was fascinating and delicious. The  staff was friendly and the service was pretty good. Will definitely visit this place next time when I go to SFO. Highly recommend this place to all the visitors :)</review>

<Review>The server seemed super nice and said the food we would eat here would be the "best food ever." He ordered food for us without actually telling us what he was bringing to us... When the food arrived, the quantity was SO little, my family looked shocked. It was simple raviolis, really small enchiladas, and rice and saag. The food all seemed like leftover, and when we asked for more he simply said that the kitchen was closed. At the end when he brought us the bill, it was $60 for three people! It was outrageous. The food was average and the amount was poor and it was way too expensive! Never going there ever again. Hope they read this and get better with their food amount.< /Review>< gmapID>

<review>Fusion Indian Jamaican food that is some of the best food that we have ever eaten.  Many times I plan my day so I can come back from SF thru Marin to pick it for dinner.  We love eating here and at their other Avatar's Punjab Burrito Shops.  The Blackened Chicken is excellent as are the enchiladas, especially the Buffalo Eggplant ones that are a special.  If you are not sure what to order.  The owner will ask you a series of questions, likes, dislikes, allergies, favorites, etc and create a meal for you or recommend something for you.  We have never been disappointed.  This place make your taste buds sing.<//review>< user>

<text>The food is state of the art, the owner who also serves guests will accommodate you with your restrictions and tastes. Great service, place is clean and with a flavor of simplistic and unique. Prices are good, (I was surprised that some say its expensive, 55$ for 2 people with dessert and drinks is cheap for high quality food). If i would live in the area i would become their permanent customer.
Exclusive place for those who appreciate the simplicity and quality.<//text><pics>None</pics>< response>

A unique restaurant that fuses Indian, Jamaican, and Mexican flavors. The owner is very friendly every time I visit and offers great suggestions. The Jamaican jerk chicken is my favorite dish - I've gotten it at least 5 times here and it's always perfect. The mango lassis here are also solid.</review>

<Review>Highly over rated restaurant.

Nothing like Indian restaurant. It's an improper blend of Punjabi and Mexican style. Food is not spicy as expected. Level 10 can be eaten easily, unlike hyped by the owner. Too much crowd and hence delay in serving.<//Review>< pictures>

very impressed with this India-fusion place. The owner was very helpful, and willing to go the extra mile to make sure your dining experience is top notch. All the dishes we had were amazing, fresh, and made with lots of care. Doesn't seem like much from the outside, but it makes up in friendly staff, tasty and healthy food<//Text>

We're vegan so when we told the chef, he told us he would create a special meal for us. And, boy, it was delicious! I would love to visit this place again since I can't take it home with me. One of the things I wanted was to meet a cook that would take cooking vegan as a challenge so I was delighted that he over-exceeded my expectations!<//text><pics>None< /pics><UserId.>107869456972446152610</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

I really wanted to love this diner turned into Indian restaurant but there was just something forced about the experience. The owner is very present and basically just asks what you're feeling (chicken, lamb, fish, etc) and any food allergies and then chooses what to make. In theory, it's a nice idea and it takes the pressure off. I would say the food was good but not amazing. Definitely an interesting experience. I wanted to try an item on the menu but was quickly pushed away in favor of the owner's choice.< /Review>

<Text>The warm hospitality offered by the owner was the best part. He explained the concept of fusion Indian food served by the restaurant. As this was our first visit, he requested us to allow him to suggest the dishes. Both the food and drinks were good. The service was quite fast as well. The restaurant is on the costlier side though.</Text>< Pics>

This review focuses on the vegetarian dishes we had at Avatar's. Imagine being able to order flavorful dishes made from ingredients used in traditional Indian cooking, an alien concept in a vast majority of Indian restaurants in the US. I personally don't have a problem with the Indian restaurant experience, but after a while, it starts to get repetitive - it's the same set of dishes on the menu everywhere (at least this seems to be the case for the vegetarian section of the menu). The guys at Avatar's excel at using not-so-commonly used veggies and greens in their preparations. Then, they take it up a notch and make fusion dishes out of these ingredients, which is simply mind blowing. The entire experience of the visit was awesome, not very different from some of the other reviewers here. Definitely going back.
An afterthought: We had been a little skeptical about going to the place after an underwhelming experience at one of the other branches of Avatar's in the area months ago. But the amount of positive feedback we got about the place, especially even from non-Indians, made the itch to pay a visit at least once irresistible. This is a completely different and unique experience.</Review>

This is by far my favorite restaurant in Marin (Sausalito location).  The food is exquisite: vivid flavor palette combined in unusual and delightful ways.  The owner/manager, Ashok, is charmingly enthusiastic and personable.  Prices are quite reasonable.  5-Stars for sure.  Check it out...<//Text>

<text>When researching places to eat near the Golden Gate, my fiance came upon Avatar's.  We, both, love Indian food and the previous reviews piqued our interest.  When we arrived, Avatar greeted us and promised a culinary adventure.  After ascertaining our food likes/dislikes, and my fiance's dietary needs, he delivered the best meal we had since arriving.  My fiance loved his personal story.  We have nothing like this in Kentucky and are definitely missing out on something wonderful.  We will return to San Francisco, and to Avatar's, without a doubt.</text><name>Andrew Ehr< /name><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< UserId.>

We had the red rock shrimp appetizer, which was nice, mostly because I never had that combination before. The basmati trio was okish, but their eggplant Fettuccini is the real deal. And they just happen to have one dessert in the menu, and that is a piece of heaven on your mouth. The blast of flavours will take you to a different place. Must try.
The head server, which I am guessing is the owner, is entertaining. The lady who was cooking, also came to serve at times, was a little rough, and came out rude, when she snatched our plate , when we were half done with the appetizers. That left a bad impression in a way.<//Text>

The food was awesome, server'ashok kumar'i think his name that's printed on menu was awesome, he serves best fusion of Spanish and indian food, he made us do treasure hunting in their food, we tried our best but at the end we all were wrong.their punjabi enchiladas were so good, wish we have this kind of restaurant on east coast.
Sitting area was nice and food is also healthy and moderate spicy.< /Review>

Avatar is a small magical restaurant that infuses quality, natural and healing spices in all of their foods. There is no dairy, sugar or gluten in this restaurant. The food is spectacular, I had the pumpkin crab enchiladas, somosas, and their incredible dessert. If I lived near here, I would make Avatar a weekly habit. Please eat here, get to know the owner and staff, and do your body and palate the favor of this beautiful food.< /review>

And sometimes you are destined to make your soul happy with good food.
This is the place for No oil, No dairy and No gluten food.
We are yet in shock how INDIAN food be made without their main ingredient and oh so yumm.
Only one desert in the menu but without sugar was worth the try.<//text>

The owner claimed to offer the best taste in vegetarian food, the catch was to trust him and order “Saag suspense” ( self-assigned nickname) i.e. you play blind While ordering food. If you, Guess the key vegetable in 5 curries and food is free!

overpriced but good food as it came to $30 per person. Not the best ever but unique for sure.< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Delicious! My boyfriend and I love Indian food and he has been craving it for a while. We sat down and were sceptical about trying the Enchilladas. I got one with sweet potato and he got something with Lamb. He said the lamb was exactly what he wanted, but one bite of my dish and he was jealous- finished his plate then continued to eat off mine too! 2 Enchilladas come with rice and it was definitely filling. Took my leftovers home and can't wait till I get to eat my leftovers! The owner was very kind and so was the waiter. I couldn't help but leave a little note of thanks on my receipt and the owner shouted thanks as we left. I will definitely return next time I'm in the area :-)))<//Text><user_name>Jess Bulley< /user_name>< Date>

Excellent hospitality by Ashok and the food was one of its kind and different from the usual Indian cuisine. Must try if you have an open mind about fusion food.</review>

< review>
Very nondescript from the outside,  but with a nice small interior with tables and a counter.  Definitely recommended for gluten free diners as nearly everything on the menu is GF and they had a GF beer,  Glutenberg IPA.  We arrived a lot earlier than our reservation due to a change in plans,  but were able to be seated.  The host/owner was very personable as was the staff.  Three different dishes,  enchiladas,  chicken curry, yoghurt chicken were all very good.<//review>

<text>Indians , never go there. It's a total confusion and they say it as well on the menu card. Food was overpriced and quantity was very less, also not at all Indian food. Shrimp appetizer 3 shrimps for 13 dollars on the plate. And not grilled but a burnt bitter taste. Not recommend. Just because I have to select at least 1 star to post this, I am selecting.</text><Date>1484492335324<//Date></record>

<text>Probably the best indian food we've had. The owner/manager exudes energy and the place has a great vibe, in a tiny space. The owner recommended three entrees (lamb, fish and chicken) and, I can't remember their names, but they were all DELICIOUS! We loved it so much that we ordered the Punjabi Enchiladas, Chicken Breast Tenders to go.

This is hands down my favorite place to eat in Mill Valley! Great price, ample portions and the food is soo good! Meat and veggie options are equally delicious. I`m a sucker for anything with eggplant or lamb, and here you can get it all in one delicious burrito! It's a little family-owned treasure- eat there!</review>

You cannot go enough, you cannot order enough different items off the menu... you cannot believe the kind and warm and generous owner's promise, "If it's not the best thing you have ever tasted, you don't pay".

This is one of the most delicious spots in Marin, and it's casual enough to go for lunch, then dinner than night, and lunch the next day!  They are a special, important, and wonderful aspect of our community, and have created some of the best food for us Marin-ites! THANK YOU ALL!< /Text>

Don't go here. The owner is overbearing, bordering on rude. Fusion food requires thoughtful combination of subtle flavors, and there is nothing of that sort being seen in the food here.  If you ignore for a minute that the food is either Indian or Fusion, it is at best mediocre food. Don't be fooled by the reviews.</Review>

Great vegan offerings at this location. The pumpkin burrito was amazing. Just ask, and the the Host will have a special "off the menu" item made for you " Chef's choice".  Moderate pricing</review>

Nothing special, owner does know how to sell and brags a lot about the food they offer, found it pretty ordinary. Vegan ppl be careful specially coz they dont hv much to offer so they vl say a spl veg dish wud be prepared but vl actually serve rice & a plain wrap of some veggies, way too over priced. Chicken curry is ok while NZ lamb curry was pretty ordinary with meat not being soft at all.</Text>

This is by far the best Indian restaurant in the Bay Area. I make this bold statement as an Indian person with a talented cook for a mother and countless experiences eating at Indian restaurants while growing up in the area. This restaurant best exemplifies healthy, tasteful Indian cuisine, as well as some incredible fusion dishes (I had to go back several times to try all the Punjabi enchiladas). The masala chai is always freshly made to order, and you can be confident that anything you order is made with the best ingredients.

By food quality alone this place deserves 5 stars. The owner, a delightful man who greets every customer and takes every order, will make your experience personalized and extraordinary. Aside from his deep knowledge as a nutritionist, he is deeply engaged in the customer experience and is a perfect example of how to run a successful business for decades. Just as his food exemplifies healthy and tasteful food of India, his personality exemplifies the work ethic and dharmic sense of responsibility of India.

This is truly one of the hidden gems of California and I whole-heartedly recommend this restaurant to everyone.</Text>

Amazing Indian fusion food, the likes of which have never been tasted. Owner Ashok personally came out to guarantee that we would love the food and boy he was so right! Ashok whips up creations with unique veggies that are not used in typical Indian restaurants. Must go!<//review>

Good location, the food was excellent, and the family running it is so engaging and friendly, you wish every restaurant was that way.  They will actually take the time and speak to you about your preferences and tolerances, and tailor a meal to you that's not even on the menu.  I'm looking forward to the next time we are there.<//Text>

Food certainly does not meet the standards of what the menu promises. The first thing the table waiter does is sit us down and brags about the healthiest Indian food ever to be served on the planet of earth and later comes with the greasiest table of chicken and lamb on plate with very ordinary flavor<//review>

<review>Our family's absolute favorite restaurant in all of Marin!! Ashok is the most accommodating of restauranteurs with his friendly personality and his willingness to cook you any dish just the way you like it (spicy or mild, with or without dairy, vegan, or full-on omnivore). Every meal I have had at Avatar's has been delicious and satisfying.<//review>< rating>

I feel like this place is really overrated or the entire office ordered the wrong items.  For all of the hype, it was somewhat tasteless.  I want it to be good, but unfortunately it's not.  I do plan on trying it again to see if they can change my mind.< /Text>

This was on our way home, and my wife explained to the owner her Diatetic needs, and he said leave it to me. He brought Somosas, and a plate with Turn up, Sweet pototo, grilled Tomatoe, quinoa, and quinoa greens.  My wife said it was like Heaven.< /review>

<name>John Baker Lent</name><rating>4<//rating><Text>Somewhat cramped, non-scenic location in Sausalito, but very popular and unique.  The owner is very friendly (although a tad pretentious) and will help you through the menu.  The curry trio is good and what I expected. The rose mango dream (raviolis) are very good and come with a special variant of alfredo sauce that is excellent. The samosa dish was ok. Overall, though, the portions are somewhat small for the price.<//Text>< resp>

Hit or miss place taste wise. Restrooms need to be more accessible, can't expect guests to cross cramped dishwashing place to reach restroom.</Review>

My wife's relatives took us there for lunch the day after 2017 Thanksgiving :) I had the Lamb Enchiladas. It was divine! The basmati rice was great. Also, it is in their menu that you can request to customize your order. The host, Ashok, is a very gracious person and will make you feel very welcome. I highly recommend this place. It is a "Marindian" cuisine which I was not able to ask what it was but on our way back to San Francisco before the golden gate bridge there is the Marin Headlands (Marin + Indian). Maybe it was named after that.<//text>

Indian,  wow I eat southern Indian at a few places in Orlando,  Woodlands and Indian Hut there is a big difference between what I had at Avatars.
I had the dish with the Rock Shrimp,  I had to look twice for the Shrimp.

There is a feel good set up, but I went there for a meal.<//review>

<Review>Owner is always there. He's a nice guy and you can tell really loves his business. The food is pretty great it's probably the best blend of spices and flavors I have tasted. I recommend the Jamaican jerk chicken, kama sutra all punjabi style with a spicy level of 5/10 or 7/10 if you want it hotter.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Interesting indo-mexican fusion restaurant. We had the methi ravioli, pumpkin enchiladas and fajita rice of which we liked the ravioli and enchiladas a lot. Desert was also very good. The restaurant owner helps you with what to order if its your first visit. Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely try some of the other veg dishes next time we are around SF.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808585050d11d18d:0xe1d770086a096be</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I have no complaints about food here. But my complaint is about the owners attitude and his complete disregard for making appointments. Last time, I went with my parents. We had a reservation for 7 pm and he made us wait for an hour saying 2 mins 2 mins each time making it impossible to predict when he is going to give table. I went today again . I had an appointment at 7 pm. I went there sharply at 7. There were a lot of empty tables. Again he said he needed 2 mins. He seated another group who dint have an appointment!! When I asked him around 715,  he asked us to wait for more time. When I confronted him about empty tables, he said those are reserved. When I said that we had a reservation too, his reply was why can't you wait for more time? He said ok when we said we are leaving. Then also no offer for empty tables.

Dear owner, please value your customers. Please think carefully before playing this game with appointments again not to lose more customers.< /text>

During our summer trip to Sfo and Sausalito we went there and we were amazed to meet the ownerand the variations in the recipes ... Use of pumpkin in enchiladas ... Never thought of eating the combination but it turned out to be super yummy. Must try !! Fusion food, indomexican, healthy , gluten free ... Speciality of Avatars<//text>< Rate>

<text>its a great place for introduction to indian food for locals. The place is run with electrific serving of Mr. ashok. He is quite a personality, we had a great time chatting with him about the place and its history. food was great, priced aptly according to the locale (otherwise, a bit on the higher side).
still recommend it to the everyone.< /text><Gmap_id>0x808585050d11d18d:0xe1d770086a096be</Gmap_id>< Pics>
