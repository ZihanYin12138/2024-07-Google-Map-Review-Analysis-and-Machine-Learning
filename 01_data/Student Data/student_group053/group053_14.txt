<time>1627664583357</time><Rating>5</Rating><review>Smart Parke was the first place we took our 5 month old puppy to socialize / learn while we were at work. She was very shy and reserved, but by the second week she was so excited to go (kudos to everyone for helping her confidence and socializing skills) Everyone is amazing- front desk and all those behind the scenes that ensure things run smoothly. We appreciate everyone so so much, it feels so good to leave our child where we know she is loved and taken care of! I also love spying on her through the cameras you can access online- theres always a reassurance that she is doing well.

Calypso loves her little Smart Parke family! Thank you all.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBHXzDr2xHvIRJY37C7ezjYKe3x1Zw09BaDbBc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGuP1l2kdyvAvLQh8gaXW9uIEAXT2m_OnuiVI-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

I have been bringing my dog, Oliver, to Smart Parke for about six weeks. Oliver is a 2 1/2  YO  rescue who led a very challenging life before I was fortunate enough to bring him into my home about five months ago.

I cannot say enough good things about Smart Parke and its amazing staff.  The facility is first class, from entry , to the dogs' diverse and entertaining areas to departure.  Beyond that, without exception, everyone I have encountered or worked with at SP has been friendly, caring, helpful, patient and  knowledgeable in all interactions with me and, more importantly, with Oliver.  When he and I arrive and depart, we are treated as friends and family and not just customers.  And, during his stays, Oliver is in dog heaven.

Smart Parke and, most importantly, its amazing staff, has helped make Oliver an even happier, more special dog than he was already before we found this special place.

If you want to enhance your dog's life (and your own as part of the process) bring them to Smart Parke under whatever flexible   (and very affordable) program that works for you and your pup.

Sincerely,
Marc S<//review>

< review>
Thanks to the team at Smart Parke for helping ease the woes of leaving my fur-baby behind while we visited out-of-town family. Knowing I could access the live stream feed to check on him various times of the day to see him playing with other dogs or resting inside his suite put my heart at ease. I thought the daily report cards were adorable, and I greatly appreciated the individualized comments about his eating habits (or lack thereof on his own accord) while being boarded. The complimentary bath was also greatly appreciated. I feel confident this team keeps a watchful eye on my dog and the other doggy guests. I have already booked another reservation for a trip this fall.< /review>

Staff at Smart Parke were incredibly polite, attentive, and professional. Any questions or concerns i had were answered promptly. The availability to view your pet 24/7 is an absolute game changer! Making us feel so comfortable at all times. The outdoor and indoor play room is one of a kind. Thank you for taking such good care of Yogi< /review>

<user_id>102444602976005268917< /user_id><review>Smart Parke, is by far, the best dog boarding and daycare center around!!! My little guy, Jazper,  had a great time and my 15 year old Zoe was safe and relaxed.
I could see a little separation anxiety from my 4 year old on the cameras in his room, but for his first time, it was to be expected.
It was a treat to have them bathed and fresh when I picked them up!
The experts and employees at Smart Parke were all friendly and knowledgeable.
I give Smart Parke 5 Stars!!!
Thank you again for taking special care of my babies!< /review>< Pics>

We have been looking for a nice place to board our Golden Doodle puppy.  We have looked for a place that has 24/7 care and now we have found it!  Most places have over night cameras, but never a person on the premises.  Can’t wait to make this our Poppy’s home away from home.

Our little Poppy has been staying for play throughput the week. She runs into the building to see her new friends</Review>

<text>They didn’t have the decency or professionalism to tell us what happened to my puppy, I had to find out myself by looking at her. Not to mention, one of their receptionist (red head, early 40’s) is terribly rude and doesn’t know the policy regarding personal items (on the first visit they allowed us to bring her favorite toy, then the second visit she said their policy changed which we were not notified nor is it present on their website; then when I picked  up our pup she asks if our puppy had any personal items with her—like what??). The first time they didn’t even provide report cards and the video cam (for overnight) wasn’t working, but the second time we brought our pup for overnight (we didn’t have a choice because another place we were interested in couldn’t book us so late) actually worked and they provided report cards everyday, but I wonder if they did that since we brought it to their attention the first time. When I went to pick up my pup and was trying to put her harness on, the woman holding the leash just let it go and thank goodness the doors were closed otherwise she would have darted outside. Very unprofessional and they do not meet the standards that they advertise on their website, only until you mention it. Ridiculous. Granted, it is clean and we liked the video cameras but that’s about it. Thank goodness we have found the perfect place and know we will receive the professional service and proper care for our puppy.

I find it very interesting how your response was to say, “ you’re sorry if it [policy] was confusing to [me]” rather than apologizing for not making your policy on personal items clearer. You allowed for her to take the toy the first time we went there and then the second time you said no. Yeah, okay, I agree, that would be confusing to anyone. Either you don’t or you do and make it clear from THE start, not the second time. Unbelievable. Then to not even address the scratch or cut on her side it’s incredibly irresponsible of you.< /text></record>

<username>Stephen Mercurio<//username><review>Smart Parke is beautiful. The staff is professional and kind. I had many questions and they promptly responded to my emails and phone calls. They quickly made me and my pup (Luca - and yes I named him that before the Disney movie came out) feel very comfortable. My pup had so much fun on his first day (evaluation) and he slept the rest of day when I got him home. I watched him play for 4 hours on their really cool pup cameras. He goes back this weekend for boarding and I feel confident he will be well cared for. This place is excellent!<//review><time>1624403076913< /time>< Resp>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Smart Parke saved us this last weekend! We had to figure out very last minute place to board Sibley and Smart Parke worked with us to make it happen. Smart Parke has webcams and provides a check in from the staff with a video and report on how your animal's day was. I felt comfortable knowing Sibley was in such good hands. They provided his medication as prescribed and even included bath service in his boarding package. It was really nice to have Sibley come back nice and clean after playing with his friends all weekend. Great staff, friendly and easy to work with and, most importantly, good with the dogs!

Excellent quality of care and supervision for our dog Apollo who had his first overnight stay. The camera access to the main day camp areas are a huge plus and gave us a lot of reassurance about leaving him alone for the first time. We watched how the staff were extremely attentive to the dogs and clean up their accidents ASAP. Plenty of space for the density of dogs at any given time. I’d say there was a max of about 30 or so dogs in the main day camp area, and the indoor and outdoor spaces is plenty of space for that number of dogs. Despite the large number of dogs, I didn’t see any serious scuffles between dogs. If any dogs did play a bit rowdy, the staff interrupted them right away. That was extremely reassuring knowing my dog is safe and happy. Also, booking over phone or text is super easy, which was an awesome benefit for us since we had to reschedule very last minute a couple times.

My only critique is the camera in the sleeping quarters. It was pointed mainly at the wall, making up probably about 3/4ths of the entire camera view. So we didn’t really get the chance to see how our dog was doing. This is probably a super simple fix for them, so hopefully they will take care of that soon. I’m still giving 5 stars for the overall quality, price, and staff at this facility, because I doubt any other facilities can compare.</review>

I love the cameras !! Watching my pup was addictive!
The staff really cares for all the dogs. Lots of room for pup to run and play and get wet, also the staff was very quick picking up waste.
They will be the only place I bring my Leilani<//Text>

<text>Very friendly staff from the 1st time I walked in. I have a dog that I wanted to socialize and was very nervous how he would do but he did great! They offer a 2-4 assessment of your pet for free! They eased him in to the group and there are staff there keeping order if need be. They have indoor and outdoor areas to play and you can watch the cameras the whole time to check in on your pup. This was just his assessment trial but so far I am very happy with them. Will be taking him back next week!</text><Gmap_id>0x80dce9a3d52b1657:0x753e13b1d740d275<//Gmap_id><Rate>5<//Rate>< Pics>

This visit was our first experience with Smart Parke. Our dog stayed two nights. The enthusiasm of the staff at drop off made me feel better about leaving and their review of his visit told me they cared. I enjoyed watching him on the webcam and he smelled great when I got him because he received a bath.  We’ll definitely be coming back and the facility was very clean.< /text>

<Text>Absolutely amazing place. Only place that I have seen that has indoor play space for my dog as well as an outdoor playground with water. My lab loves the water and also enjoys being outside. One of the main things I look for in a daycare facility is outdoor space. My dog can stay inside at home but at Smart Parke, she can run around outside all day long. The misters are a great added touch to keep the turf cool. The cameras are amazing quality to watch my dog play all day. The staff are amazing with the dogs and always give them attention. Just an amazing place. I drive 20-30 minutes out of my way to take my dog here. I am very happy with this facility and hope that they open more.< /Text>< UserId.>

{'time': 1625702327545, 'text': "We are sorry and surprised to hear that you had such a negative experience. Our overnight accommodations do include a half day of camp, 24 hours web cameras so you can monitor your pet, maid service every day, house cuisine, staff on site 24/7 so pets are never left unattended and a complimentary bath on their last day. The vast majority of facilities do not offer all of these services as part of the fee.\n\nFor the half day of camp that is included with every dog's stay, we split that time up so each dog gets a few hours in the morning and a few hours in the late afternoon. Many facilities offer a half day of camp in one block and then the dogs have to wait until the next day to go back to camp. We feel it is better for the dogs to split it up. Clients do have the choice to upgrade their pet to have a full day of Day Camp for a nominal fee. We also offer all sorts of upgrades so you can tailor your pets stay (Peanut Butter Kongs, Frozen Yogurt, one-on-one Cuddle time, etc.).\n\nWe offer our house cuisine at no additional charge. If a pet is on a personal diet,  we have a kitchen just for the pets that includes refrigerators, freezers and a microwave. We charge $3 per day for pets to have their own personal diets. If a pet is not eating we reach out to the owner to get permission to use enticement (such as wet food or treats). We do not charge for that service.\n\nIn Day Camp, we do not allow toys because pets can become possessive and resource guard items. This can cause conflicts between the dogs which we do not want. Our staff's goal is to safely monitor the dogs in Day Camp so they can safely engage in play with one another and not to offer personalized one-on-one attention to each individual pet in Day Camp. This can cause conflicts with dogs as well since they can become possessive over staff. We do recommend if you would like more personalized attention for your pet that you can add on a one-on-one Cuddle time.\n\nIn an off leash Day Camp environment, dogs do play with their mouths and bodies. It is very common for there to be minor scrapes and scratches - just like with kids going to kindergarten. If there ever is an incident that is more serious, we thoroughly evaluate the dog and report any wounds immediately to the owner. We would have liked to speak with you directly regarding your concerns but could not find you in our system. Please call our facility and ask to speak wo one of the Managers directly so we can speak directly. We wish you and your pet the best wherever you chose to go in the future."}</Resp>

I am being generous with my rate of 1 star! I boarded my dog with high expectations and was really disappointed. It was so bad I would have removed my dog if possible. She was left alone in her room - except for a few hours a day when NO ONE interacted with her. The have cameras and I watched for hours as the attendants ignored the dogs while on their phones or talking to each other. It was terrible. I felt bad for all the dogs. There were no toys, no games. My dog was picked up with a huge chuck missing from the side of her nose and dog teeth marks - with fur removed. It was terrible. I did not notice on pick up because she was so excited she would not stay still for a second.  I called after her not eating for a few days and had to pay extra for them to give her attention and then I had to pay even more for her to be included in the add day dg care - which is ridiculous! Then I paid extra for treats to try and get her to eat. I mean I seriously ended up paying almost $100 a day for her to get treated like she was in the dog pound. I will never use them again and I would not recommend them.< /review><date>1624169163018< /date></record>

Kusco seemed to enjoy his time at Smart Parke.  Of course, maybe the best way to tell is to bring him back and see his reaction to going back inside!
My feedback would be that your operation seems very professional and smoothly-run, and your staff seemed to interact very well with the dogs.  One suggestion, though: you may want to improve the very end of the evaluation process in terms of formalizing the feedback to the owner.  When we picked up Kusco, we were told that if we wanted feedback on Kusco's visit, we should ask the person who brought him to the front, who unfortunately had already left by then (i.e., gone into the back with the dogs).
Fortunately, the person we asked about getting feedback was, herself, able to give feedback, so it worked out.  I would suggest a very small form with 3 to 4 checkboxes indicating how the dog interacted with the other fur-babies.

When my dog is cared for at Smart Parke I know he is safe and being cared for professionally by dog loving young people. It is a beautiful state of the art facility and it is a pleasure to do business with the staff. My shy pup is learning love it too!</Text>

<text>This was our first experience leaving our rescue dog to go on a family vacation. The team at Smart Parke is fantastic and my pup had the time of his life.

A great place to board your dog.  The staff is so friendly and kind every time I drop my dog off for either daycare or overnight stays.  I love the the space that the dogs have to roam and the standard suites the dogs get to sleep in.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to give their pet a friendly place to stay while you travel.</Review>

Brought our pup here once and my partner left a nice (5 star) review.  The owners response to the review seemed pretentious and obtrude.

Update:
We appreciate that the company took the time to call us to let us know they didn't mean to be condescending in their response. While we still disagree with the decision to charge extra for feeding his regular diet, we were very happy with how our dog was treated during his stay here and wanted to update the rating to reflect the experience as a whole.</text>

<pics>None</pics><Review>The team at Smart Parke are so nice and friendly. First time trying out a half day of daycare with them, and they took such good care of our puppy. We'll definitely be using them for more daycare days. We really loved their live webcam for observing how our puppy behaved and interacted with the other dogs. They had a good balance of inside and outside play time, along with cuddle time, which all of the pups loved. The staff also kept a good eye on all dogs to clean up any messes immediately, they were very calm, and they promoted positive play habits so pups wouldn't play too rough.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Smart Parke is a WONDERFUL place to leave your pups for doggie daycare or if you are going out of town.  They treat them so well and I feel that they were safe.  They have 24/7 supervision, plenty of play time and it’s sparkling clean.   One thing that made me especially comfortable (and happy) was that we could use their webcams to check on them any time day or night.    We missed our pups and it was great to see for ourselves that they were healthy and having a good time.   The daily report cards were also great!<//Text>

{'time': 1620088408444, 'text': "Hi Justin,\n\nThanks for the great feedback....  Very happy to hear that you and Westly were happy with the facility and the service.\n\nI thought I would give you a little information on the food we feed in-house.  We feed PureVita to our in-house boarders (the same quality brand that we sell in the lobby) and have found that is rare for our boarders to have transition issues.  PureVita is a little more expensive than other brands (probably won't find many other boarding operations feeding this level of food), but our focus has been to achieve a top to bottom excellent experience for our clients and their pets.\n\nHopefully you are feeding a quality brand...I promise you that it can only positively impact your pets health and likely saves you money over the long run due to dealing with less issues!\n\nThe additional cost of $3 per day is really about the additional cost of maintaining a separate diet for an individual boarder.  When you have a lot of boarders with a lot of different personal diets their truly are additional costs involved.\n\nHopefully we will see you and Westly again soon!\n\nBest,\n\nSmart Parke"}</resp>

Our 4 month old Westley had a great time in daycare and first overnight boarding at Smart Parke. It was a modern and well maintained facility. We appreciated the indoor/outdoor access the dogs got to enjoy. The staff thoughtfully planned the schedule to keep a balance of activity in the play areas and ensure the dogs got nap time in addition to play time. It was also nice being able to keep an eye on him during his stay through the webcams.

The only thing we found a little disappointing was the $3 daily add-on to feed him his own diet rather than a “house diet.” It can upset a dogs stomach to change their diet abruptly, so that seemed like something that should have been included.</Text>

Smart Parke is a great dog sitting/day care and also overnight dog boarding business. I live in Laguna Beach and needed a close and loving solution for boarding for my dog.  I felt great about this company.  Amazing staff.  Close by.  Love the video cameras to check on my dog!  We will be back. ❤️<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Everything was absolutely perfect and professional.  Facility clean, well thought out and pricing very fair. The staff was excellent and attentive. My pet is a 15 year old blind and deaf maltese. She functions by scent and barking so I was nervous leaving her in a strange place. She can be trying and the staff was excellent and patient with her. I took their suggestion of all day camp and it was the best thing for her. I highly recommend Smart Parke. No hesitations using them again.

Having never boarded our fur baby before, we were apprehensive. I am so grateful that we came across Smart Parke. My doggie played all day and wore himself out. There are cameras in the play areas and in the individual sleeping rooms so nervous parents can check in and see their puppy real time. Absolutely recommend.< /Text>

<text>I was looking for clean , playful environment for my St. Bernard dog  after months of looking I found smart parke and I am soooo happy with the service provided
Specially all staff are super friendly  and helpful

My dog  visits Smart parke like twice a week and every time my dog walks inside Smart parke she is  super happy and excited , my pet also  boards when we go on vacation and I’m at piece of mind when I’m gone because Smart parke sends me text , videos updates how my dog is doing , and updates of amount of food consume

I can also  monitor my pet on webcam all day and when boarding they have webcams on the suite

Best of all Smart parke has pool and my St. Bernard loves the pool< /text><Resp>{'time': 1623822576576, 'text': 'Thank you Vanessa for the great review! We ❤️ Your baby girl!'}</Resp>< user>

SmartPark caught my eye for boarding and daycare because of their outdoor space and ability to view the dogs in their rooms while boarding. As it turns out both of these things are very limited. When I first took my dog for daycare they were able to go back and forth inside and outside. That only happened that one time now the gate is closed and they are only allowed outside for short periods a few times a day. The cameras in their rooms for sleeping only look at the bed the ceiling and the walls. You cannot see the entire room. You don't know if they are walking around on their own filth, have water in their bowl, panting, pacing, or relaxed and peaceful. If you have more than one dog sharing the room often times you cannot even tell if the second dog is in there.
Every member of the team I have encountered has been pleasant . I do question some of their level of expertise. The team members in the yard often just sit there, they do not move around much.  The dogs are often left in the yard (inside and outside) by them self with no supervision. It is typically for a very short period of time, but it can be concerning.
I feel with more training and better staffing this will ultimately be a great day care. I will continue to take my dogs for short periods of time but will continue to watch and monitor very close.< /review>

{'time': 1620167429615, 'text': 'Thank you for your feedback and the extra time that you took with us over the phone.\n\nAs you have pointed out, there are things about how we operate and what we provide that you are not happy with.  We have done our very best to provide an optimum experience for pets and we take great pride in our staff, facility and operations.\n\nWe encourage pet owners to shop around for the best situation for their precious fur family members. We want people to tour the other boarding facilities, meet the staff, look at what the business has to offer, compare overall pricing, compare free services included etc.  Not every facility will work for every pet owner.\n\nWe are so proud that we have cameras available 24/7 in both the play areas and sleeping quarters.  For the most part, the viewing access we provide is far greater than most of our competitors.  For example, you may not be happy with the viewing in the sleeping quarters, but we know we are one of the only boarding facilities that provide that extra assurance for the pet owners.  Our staff does constantly check on the pets in their suites and they clean up accidents, fill water bowls and check on the overall well being of the pet.  We understand the trust that owners are placing on us with their fur babies and we treat all of them with the utmost care and compassion.\n\nIn addition to the cameras, our indoor/outdoor set up is unique to the area and there are times that we have to close one part off to the dogs for cleaning, to give the dogs a rest, if the weather is not cooperating, etc.  Luckily in those instances, we are fortunate that our indoor area alone is bigger than most of the other facilities out there.  At times a staff member does need to sit down but that doesn’t mean they are not doing anything, they are always watching the dog and their interactions.\n\nWe appreciate your business and hope that your feel more enthusiastic about what we have to offer should you visit us in the future.  If not, we wish you (and Abbie and Super Nova!) the very best.\n\nThanks\n\nSmart Parke'}<//response>

Smart Parke is a beautiful doggie daycare and boarding facility! This is the first time we’ve boarded our puppy lab, Winnie, and we felt so comfortable bringing her to Smart Parke knowing she’d be in great hands for the next few days. We love that there are cozy and clean private suites, and the staff members even provide a daily report card with a video update!

I took my 3 girls yesterday for a playgroup evaluation. They came home happy and exhausted and I’m so happy to have found this place. We will be boarding in a couple of weeks for a week.
This place is HUGE and the staff is very attentive and kind.< /text>

Super clean, great staff, cameras, and good prices.  We found the best place for a shy "only pup".. now he loves it.  Great to buy a package and drop him off and explore Laguna and the OC.  Did I mention the awesome staff!!??</text>

<Review>This place is by far the best place to take your fur baby!  I can't talk enough about how much I love this place for my dog Nova!
The staff is sooooo friendly and all have such great energy and you can tell they genuinely love animals. I have never felt so safe leaving my dog to point where I want to take her  there just because it's Soo much fun.
The facility itself is Disneyland for dogs. They have everything and the webcams are perfect for just checking in. 5 star all the 6 stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ in my opinion! Thank you so much for this place and finding right people to care for our fur-families!</Review><Time>1626992750315< /Time>< Rate>

Our dog Francis walked through the door with the handler and never looked back! He didn't want to leave, either, but he has an overnight visit scheduled for later this week. The facility is extremely clean with no odors, and there are employees with the dogs at all times. Perfect resort for those times he can't come with us!<//review>

I was warmly greeted when I arrived with my dog for boarding.  The next day I received a text letting me know how my dog was doing and they also included video of my dog.  When I picked him up they had given him a bath.  This was a great boarding experience!< /review>

We took our dog for an evaluation to see if he was a good candidate for the doggie day care. The staff was amazing...super friendly and professional. They explained the process and told us to come back in 4 hours to pick him up...and if he had problems socializing, we would get a call to pick him up. We picked him up four hours later and he was exhausted from all the playing. And the evaluation was FREE! Took him back Father's Day and got to see him playing on their live webcams throughout the day. We also got a tour of the facility when we went to pick up him up. For us, Smart Parke is going to be the go-to place to take our dog for day care and extended stays!</text>

Smart Parke is an excellent place for your beloved dog. They care about your baby that how he behaves, feels... You're not going to get concerned about your baby cause you can check them out with webcams. It's a clean place and nice staff.<//review>

He would much rather be with people.  The staff helped introduce him to other dogs.  Even though we have taken him to dog parks, it is still very slow progress but we certainly appreciate the staff’s kind and loving ways with Bisquick and their efforts with him. It is very apparent that the staff really enjoys and loves pets.  We will stay patient with Bisquick and plan on using the staff and facility to improve his social skills on our very next need - next week to the snow!  Thank you!!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

This was my dog's first encounter with Smart Parke, and it was for her "evaluation" before she could be accepted as a client. I was given the impression a human would be monitoring how well she did, but as I watched the webcam (for 4 hours!) there was little to none interaction with her from any human. I could tell she was hesitant, and nervous. I was hoping that one of the humans would actually touch her, pet her, comfort her. But that never happened. I get that she needed to be observed how she would do on a "typical" day of daycare. But the humans I watched from the webcams spent time with their back to my dog, focused on the computer shelf, talking over the fence with other humans, and not once approached my dog, or gave her any notice. For four hours.  The little dogs in her yard got petted, picked up and carried around. But my dog was off on her own and it broke my heart. And the outside yard was only opened up to her a few minutes before I picked her up. The big dogs had both indoor and outdoor yards open the entire time. I know my girl would have enjoyed being in the outside yard but when I asked about it, I was told "it depends" on the staff when they open it up. As I said at the start of this, I will reevaluate my rating after the next daycare event we have. I'd really like this group to be successful but my rating won't change if I see my girl ignored and so stressed out.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

Ricky and Lucy, my two great danes, went to Smart Parke for their evaluation and they did great. They loved spending time there, they especially loved the pool! We will definitely be back at least 1-2 per week. The staff was super welcoming and very patient with all my questions and concerns. Thank you Smart Parke :)<//Text>

they love dogs here!  Friendly staff who truly care about loving your pet.  My pet stayed here for the first time for 6 nights and I can't say enough about the experience.  They sent videos daily of my doggie playing in the water and with his furry friends.  Highly recommend.</text>

We boarded our 2 Frenchies for 3-days when we were out of town. I had been checking out many boarding facilities prior to that, none of which had all of the accommodations  I was hoping for,, until an internet search led me to Smart Parke. We went and checked them out and they had everything and more that We was looking for. The staff there is attentive, caring, and truly amazing. I also loved that we could check in and watch our dogs on cam whenever we wanted. This was a great sense of relief to us. They have a huge indoor and outdoor play area for the dogs, which is so much better than anything else I’ve seen.
You can trust they take exceptional care of your pet. It’s truly the “ Disney” for dogs place to go.< /Text>

Excellent facility set up, nice environment for the dogs and friendly staff. The pay structure is overly complicated and ridiculous if you bring multiple dogs, but the strangest aspect is paying extra to have them feed your dog with your own food that you bring. Overall we like smart parke the most of the facilities in the area.</review>

When you have a lot of boarders with a lot of different personal diets their truly are additional costs involved.\n\nClients sometimes also request feeding for day care visits.....this brings on additional elements of separating the dogs for feeding and allowing the dog some time alone (in a boarding suite for  an hour) so that we don\'t have any issues with a dog playing too hard right after feeding and getting a twisted stomach (very dangerous situation!).   Not sure what we are going to do with this charge over the long term...as I am sure our expenses are higher than the $3 for a day care visitor!\n\nWe are a "work in progress" and we are grateful to hear what our clients like and don\'t like.\n\nHope to see you soon!\n\nBest\n\nSmart Parke'}</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dce9a3d52b1657:0x753e13b1d740d275< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We haven’t boarded our dog in a few years
I thought I would try Smart Parke.
My English Bulldog loves it there. They keep her active and engaged.  The genuinely care about her. I get daily updates with video. Warms my heart.
She is exhausted when she gets home.
I’ve boarded her there three times and have two more scheduled in the next month and a half.
I really like the fact that she can socialize with other dogs.<//Text>

Boarded my dog for 4 nights/5 days and she had a wonderful time. They have a large and interactive facility with both great indoor and outdoor spaces. The overnight suite was a great size. My favorite part is the cameras with multiple views throughout the facility, including the suite, so that I could check in on my dog while we were gone. Everytime I checked in on the cameras she looked to be having a great time. Prices are fair for the area and the staff is very friendly.</Text>

<Review>We boarded our 8 month old puppy during Thanksgiving. Smart Parke did an amazing job taking care of him! They sent us daily report cards letting us know how he was eating and playing and even included a video of him. In addition they have cameras in the play areas and each suite so I could check on him throughout the day. Each time I looked in on him he was so happy, running around with all of the other dogs. I was most impressed when we came to pick him up we had arrived sooner than they expected and he wasn’t bathed yet. Jennifer didn’t even skip a beat and jumped right in, gave him a bath and we were all set. Thank you for taking such good care of our puppy!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1606598189149, 'text': "Thank you for the kind words, Kristin!

I LOVE that they have a "menu" of add ons and webcams to creep on our fur baby! Paid extra for full day camp (1/2 day is included but our 9 month goldendoodle has a lot of energy) and a frozen treat. Would have given 5 stars but saw what looked like trash from the frozen treat in her bed at 11pm and she was trying to eat it! It would be pricey for a long stay but would definitely board her again for a short trip or day camps!< /text>

Great premium boarding facility. The rooms for the dogs are more spacious than most other places. I love the daily video report cards so I can stay updated on how my dog is doing. The webcams are nice so I can check in on my dog whenever I want. Staff is very friendly.

I also love that they give a free exit bath with boarding and don't charge a late check-out fee. This really helps to justify the premium price.</Review>

We would like to say we are pretty happy with staff and the facility after our puppy has been here for day camp couple of times.

- Many of their staff are so kind and cheerful.
- The facility is really spacious.
- Webcam is great offer and we enjoy seeing our puppy is having fun.

Actually there is one thing, it confused us that there was a quick “change” of the price for exit bath between the times when we asked before the visit and when we actually checked in. We think it was just a part of new business though.
Once again, we are happy about your staff and facility so all the best and will see you soon!< /review>

One black mark, we called to inform them we would be collecting earlier than previously indicated and gave an arrival time. This message was never passed on and when we arrived she had not been bathed!
They were very apologetic and offered to bath her immediately... we returned 45 mins later and she was like a furry Teddy Bear.... things don’t always go to plan, but it is the way in which they are corrected which is a sign of good management, and builds a good reputation... well done and thank you SmartParke!<//text>< Rate>

I absolutely love bringing my dog here. The staff is responsive enthusiastic and my pup races to the door everytime we go here. What makes this place e so unique is instead of being stuck in a room the whole time  the dogs are able to be inside and outside. I love watching on the webcam him playing in the popping water and I’m laying with other dogs.  The employees seem to monitor the playing very well. I highly recommend Smart Parke<//text>

<Review>My high energy GSP, Kaya, loves it here.  I check on her  her frequently throughout the day on the webcams and I see the staff cuddling with her and showing her so much love.  I’ve tried other day camps and they ignore the dogs and show them no affection.  The staff at Smart Parke are wonderful and take great care of all the dogs.<//Review><rating>5<//rating><user_id>103570586710873707369</user_id><Pics>None<//Pics>< date>

< review>
This was our Chocolate lab’s first overnight stay in any establishment. She loved it and I liked the fact that I could watch her playing it napping in her suite when I was missing her or wondering how/what she was doing. She’s such a social butterfly and loved played with all the dogs! She was getting tons of love snd petting from the Smart Park associates.  I also did the nail trim and brought her own shampoo to be bathed on her exit bath.  She was nice and dry and smelling clean when I picked her up. I will definitely take her here again, glad I found my new home for doggie daycare and overnight e we hen needed.

Thank you so much!< /review>

My 4 months old puppy went there for 10 days boarding..

I don’t know what happened to him, when we sent him to this center, he’s so active, so healthy, after 10 days with them, he’s so sick, he’s laying down on the ground 2 days now, laying there no energy ALL day long! He doesn’t even want to eat his favorite food. I don’t know how people took care of him. From the webcams, I see people who’s watching the dogs playing iPhone all the time, doggies are fighting behind them.

That lady was trying to be nice? She said she will give us calls to check on him, see if he’s feeling better, but never, because it’s not her dog, why she cares, the place feels the same way? They are just dogs.

We have to send him to emergency now!!!!!<//text>

We love Smartparke. I use them for boarding and day care services for Leo. I love to use the live cams to see Leo live in action.  Most dogs are happy at the center and Leo loves to be there..
I like that the dogs are allowed both indoor and outdoor .. it is lots of fun.  It would be nice if the staff tried to engage dogs more in play cycles... some dogs just have it, but some needs directions ... the staff are great and very responsive 🌹🌹🌹
overall 5 stars , we are happy and Thank you Smartparke 👍👍👍👍<//review>

Blown away! This is what was missing in the S. OC. We have experienced this level of service, care and piece of mind only in Truckee,CA. The outdoor space is amazing and a water feature that our pups can’t get enough of. Bye bye Petsmart! We are truly lucky to have Smart Parke in our backyard. Thank you for bringing this to the S. OC!

EDIT: I’m sorry but I have to update my previous post as I feel it is not accurate to what I have recently experienced.
My dogs love Smart Parke, the team at Smart Parke know them by name. I never have to worry how my pups are doing because I get personalized video check-ins daily. Smart Parke we are not worthy! Thank you Smart Parke.</text>

They are so great with furrbabies.  My little girl is so nervous and anxious. She was abused for 2 years before I got her. They are so careful and patient with as she is afraid of people, and take such good care of her.  She has been there three times and she's already starting to adjust. I would recommend this place to anybody. It's clean it's beautiful lots of room for the dogs to play. The staff are wonderful. I wish they would have been around a lot sooner.

Update: My fur baby had not been able to come to daycare in awhile. Now that she was able to go back, I am just as happy with her care since day one☺️☺️☺️<//Review>

I had such a wonderful experience with Smart parke and their team. Very personable, great communication and seemed to go above what I expected. My baby Boscoe recently had a 10 day stay and when I arrived to pick him up he seemed like he loved it there just as much as he loves home. The team watched over him and payed attention to detail when it came to his specific needs. Report cards along with surprise pictures and videos were sent daily,  perfect way to ease any anxiety when leaving your kid at daycare. Needless to say, we will definitely be back for playtime, frozen yogurt treats, baths and playtime with our newfound friends at smart parke.<//Text>

<review>BRILLIANT PLACE FOR YOUR DOG BABIES.
I had my 5 month old  pup Spock put in the smart parke day care for a day and I ve never been more comfortable. The staffs are absolutely lovely and care for the pup as their own. We had webcam access to see what our pup was doing and we were absolutely all smiles to see the staff pampering them and my Spock learnt a lot of good habits in just one day! They had separate suites for over high stay with camera access too. I think this place is everything a dog owner needs when they had to be away from their pup during work.

Thank you guys!<//review>< pictures>

< review>
Our pup Bandit loved staying here! It was also so great having the ability to check in on him though the webcam while we were out of town! The team is super friendly, and before we picked him up they gave him a bath! I know he had the best time cause he’s all snuggly and sleepy now from all his play time haha!</review>

<review>1) The gentlemen that checked us in did not know the pricing and could not explain what hours are included in an overnight stay. He gave several excuses for not knowing.
2) I could not access the webcams to see my pup. I was able to access the webcams on my pups last 2 visits.  When I called to let you know I could not access the webcams I was told that my iPhone was the problem. I did not understand that explanation since I was able to access the webcams from my same iphone my previous 2 visits.
3) I just received a text with someone else’s name and someone else’s dog’s report. That same text asked me to give 5 stars. You could at least get our names correct.

I really love your facilities and I am trying to be patient while you get going. I understand that it takes time to get policies and procedures down in a new business, but the issues I am having are basic things that any business would have in  place on day one,</review>< Pictures>

Absolutely phenomenal experience. They did a great job with my car - I can't even tell where the damage was! The customer service was fantastic and they beat the repair time estimate. I can't recommend this place enough.</Text>

If you are anywhere in the Simi Valley area and need body work take your ride to Star Auto Body. I recently had repairs done on my brand new Mazda 3 and it looks like it just rolled off the showroom floor. Their quality work is matched by their customer service. Matt is the best. The work was done ahead of schedule and he went out of his way to arrange a rental car for me making my overall experience very pleasant and worry free.</Text>

<username>Doreen Isaacs<//username><GmapID>0x80e8292c49d7561d:0x6c6eb648a92481fb< /GmapID><Text>3-2-19 Update to review - I would probably now, check out more body shops before taking to Star.  Since having it home and seeing that their "post work" car wash included ??  - idk what, because the magnet I had taken off prior, the dirt imprint was still there.  And it actually looks like they fixed my old door and did not buy a used door as was paid for (but kept the insurance money) because one of the dents up near my door handle is still noticeable at a certain angle, and the probability of another door with such a dent would be miraculous.  Then, there was tape goo on the inside of my windshield and masking tape left on the underside of my door frame - but still facing outward so you could see it - (Not very good attention to detail).
So now that I've had time to ponder the little things, (that make a Big impression), and the fact that they could have kept it longer to take care of those things, I'm disappointed.  As for the door, I really should have asked for the parts back so that I knew for sure it was taken care of.  As of now, IDK if my safety bar inside the door is still bent or not... so am I safe?
I'm not saying there bad, but I am detail oriented and expected more.

Initial review - would definitely take it back to Star if I need more work in the future.  The quality of work was excellent.  Paint match is awesome.  There was a small chunk of my inside door seal missing at the bottom, that I wish they'd have seen and fixed; But, they did re-stripe the other side of my car so it would match, guess I can't whine too much... very happy about that.  Overall, an A for Awesome!< /Text>< Pics>

I want to recommend this body shop to everyone!! The employees are friendly, helpful, and professional. I was kept informed on the progress of the repairs and the work was completed within the time frame originally stated. The repair work is beautiful! I love how my vehicle looks and drives now. The shop took care of any needed interactions with my insurance company. I will definitely use this shop again. A friend had suggested them to me, based on her own experience, and I will do the same. Thank you!!!!</text>

<Review>I would not recommend star auto body if you are paying cash. I’ve taken my car to a handful of different body shops to get quotes and just to meet and see who would be taking care of my car. My car doesn’t have much damage just needs a new bumper, hood, and headlight. All the other body shops have givin me a reasonable quote after inspecting my car thouroughly and explained to me what they would need to do. Until I brought it to Star. I had my car towed because it is illegal to drive without both headlights. After my car arrived someone looked at it for less then a minute while it was 5 feet off the ground on the tow truck. Said it had major damages that would cost 5,000 which is a hell of a lot higher then everyone else has quoted without even inspecting my car. They were all super rude about it too and mentioning that they can’t trust everyone that pays cash and even giving a few examples to why. So if you need body work done to your car and you decide to pay cash and not go through insurance Star auto body is not the place to go! But I would recommend MyWay auto body! Owner came to me checked out my car and gave me an awesome price ! I won’t ever use star with or without insurance after this experience</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Read entire thing its still less time then Star Auto body will waste you.I had to take my car back in twice after they called and said it was finished. They were repairing a dent in my rear quarter panel. First time, Somehow there was still a tiny dent on my (new)gas cap and light scratches from the accident still on my bumper. Insurance paid for it all. So I brought it back and they fixed scratches and hand pushed the dent "most of the way out". They claimed to have no idea about the tiny dent. Stuck with that by the way. Better than the huge dent from the accident no doubt. But still come on guys, right? Over the weekend I noticed some interior pieces laying around the back seat. I figured eh I can pop these on myself probably. But then i saw my rear seat belt was laying on the car floor. After inspecting further I found an inside bumper piece laying on my back seat too. So I came back in this time they seemed annoyed to see me. But I'm sorry, the work wasnt done. Matt and this bigger guy with a mustache checked it out. I even handed them the bumper piece. They took my car and all was well 5 minutes later. No apologies for me having to come in again. No have a nice day.. just "here ya go before you could finish your coffee" I was happy and left. Went to pop my rear seat back up and what do I find??? The bumper bracket..again! Tbis time it was shoved underneath my rear seat. I called in after and asked for matt. After 5 minutes on hold, tbey said he was too busy to speak to me. So I told the lady what the issue was. She seemed very caring and almost as upset as I was about my bad experiences there. She said there was no excuse for this. To bring it back in and theyd take care of it. Oh and Matt blamed the window guys for leaving all my interior stuff undone. So they literally owned 0 responsibility for anything til I spoke to that nice lady. I'm sure when tbey read tbis she will know who she is and i thank you. But because of everyone else. I will never be back and i highly suggest anywhere else. Also with the help of my uncle took apart my bumper and they just never put the left bumper bracket back on period. They probably would have lied to me about that too.<//Text>

DO NOT TAKE YOUR VEHICLE TO THIS SHOP!!!. They take advantage of their customers. Even though my repair was done through an insurance claim, I received my vehicle back to me with dust throughout the car, broken interior panels, broken runner boards, damaged interior door panels, and property damage to my subwoofers (damaged cone and ripped surround). Upon questioning the work performed, employees lied to me about removing interior panels and damaging them. As one who has worked in the automotive industry for 8 years, I could see through these lies. I pointed out missing interior panel clips, broken plastic from over-torquing screws, and scratches throughout interior panels that were removed.The manager confronted me, screamed at me and threatened me (which who the hell threatens your customers) because I pointed out all the interior damage done to my vehicle. he then accused me of smoking in my car and that was where the damage came from HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE CORRELATION BETWEEN DAMAGED PANELS AND SMOKE?! What a great way to be professional and to treat your customers-dick.  I will Never take a vehicle to this shop again. My insurance company thus far sent out an adjuster and we are in the process of taking them to court. Make sure you do not get taken advantage of these people. Not to mention that they claimed they replaced my vehicle with OEM parts and upon further investigation, the parts that were replaced were aftermarket. So they charged the insurance company as OEM parts. They are committing fraud towards insurance companies to make more money. Makes you wonder how many customers' vehicles they damaged and took advantage of. NEVER TRUST THEM THEY WILL RIP YOU AND YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY OFF!!</review>

<Review>I needed fingerprints done ASAP and am so glad I chose this business. Fast service, no wait, and straight forward! I had emailed them asking if their rates were comparable to SDCOE and the boss said he would honor the SDCOE price for me as a teacher. Was not expecting such a kind response! 100% recommend this company and I will be using them again in the future!< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I had a quick, pleasant time here getting a Fingerprint Livescan for work/school reasons. He was very professional and kind and even gave a restaurant recommendation as I went around lunch time. 5/5 - Would come back if I needed to get another Livescan for a future job!<//Review>

This SUnday I visited my friends mothers Church Greater Zion Church
I went to hear from the Lord the Living God Father Son and TheHolyGhost and I did, this pastor spoke from his heart with the spirit of truth. "U preaching good Pastor" As they say at my church. Spirit and Life Ministries
SOooooooooooo blessed from attending!  Broke off a lot of things all baggage is gone I could say more so hallelujahI &I  loved the Choir.

All Glory to God these are the last days Pastor Michael Fisher and you are most needed. God is looking for a Church. Cali, Compton stand up World wake up God has his eye and hands all over you.

We always strive for great service but, naturally, we may not always be perfect and we can’t always know exactly what everyone needs.  I apologize if we failed you somehow.\n\nI’m glad you thought the food was “good” and you liked the golden milk, though I am confused by your review.  Your review seems to suggest that you that you did not actually want to eat at our restaurant?  What does it mean, “Well truthfully, it’s good food…” ?  Did you not expect to find the food “good” or want to admit it for some reason?  Did someone force you to eat at Nourish?\n\nAnd when you say, “…it’s good food for eating the idea of what a Indian/middle eastern would eat,”  what does that mean?  Is that some strange or derogatory way of trying to say that we serve Indian food?  Was this a surprise to you?  As we clearly state in our restaurant, on our menu, on our website and on all online descriptions, and in all the pictures, our cuisine is guided by the principles of Ayurveda, the ancient medicine system of India. So, yes the food is exactly what an "Indian would eat."  Was that not clear for some reason?  And is that bad?  (I would note, though, that our food would certainly be more sattvic than the spicy, onion- and garlic-filled, meat-based food found at most typical Indian restaurants.)\n\nYou also say that, “The chicken place next door is great though I envied the young ladies eating next to me.”  Again, was someone forcing you to eat at Nourish?  Were we somehow stopping you from eating at the chicken place?\n\nAs for having prices that are “high,” I am curious what you mean by that?  I encourage you to go see what prices at other all-organic, freshly-made restaurants charge, as Nourish actually has the lowest prices in all Orange County.  Again..... the lowest prices of any all-organic, freshly-made restaurant in… all…. Orange…. County.…\n\nIf you are comparing our prices to cheap, fast food, and you don’t value organic food, or freshly made, non-frozen, non-packaged, non-reheated food, or the endless variety of specialty dishes prepared every day by a master Ayurvedic chef that aren’t available at any other restaurant, and you don’t value expensive specialty ingredients like organic Ancient-Grain Kamut and organic sunflower oil, and you don’t value eating food cooked with purified water in a mantra-infused restaurant, and you don’t value having access to one of the only authentic Ayurvedic restaurants in the country…..then, yes, indeed, Nourish prices are higher than fast food.\n\nI am glad you found our unique, organic, freshly prepared, plant-based cuisine to be “good food” and our freshly brewed Golden Milk was “enviable.”  But I am sorry, Sergio, that we didn’t deliver whatever else it was that you were looking for; and I am sorry that you chose to use a public review to abuse us with some vague dissatisfaction about our service and our “good food,” rather than simply addressing any issues you may have had directly with us and giving us a chance to make it right for you.\n\nSergio, feel free to stop by and talk with us any time about how we could have served you better.  In the meanwhile, my best to you, and I hope you find the nourishment you need.\n\nJohn'}</Response>< date>

This place is a hidden gem. The food served by this restaurant is what Indians generally eat at home, but prepared with highest quality ingredients. Other good Indian restaurants serve what Indian restaurants offer in India, not what people generally eat in their everyday life.
I see that some people have complained about the prices, but I think the prices are reasonable given that this is a specialty restaurant,  even among the Indian ones. I have also seen someone mention in their review that khichdi is poor man's food in India. Clearly the person has no idea about Indian culture. Khichdi is an ubiquitous comfort food which is often served to people who are sick. Khichdi is also offered to the gods during worshipping rituals. Like most Indian vegetarian food, khichdi can be cheap in India and therefore affordable to most.

We are Indian and we love this food.</text>

This is the only place I love to eat at now. It is extremely rare to find organic food, and also food that is not overloaded with spices and garlic. I love that I don't have to burn my mouth with spices while eating here. Meals are filled with fresh veggies, which I love. Our absolute favorites are samosas and burritos! The Chai is velvety, and ORGANIC! Prakash gave me suggestions on how to balance my doshas, and it's working. The food and the people here are good, that's why I keep coming back.</review>

<Date>1619990044922< /Date><rating>1< /rating><text>As a nutritionist, and someone well versed in Ayurvedic nutrition, I eat here regularly and recommend it often. Yes it’s overpriced -  I know because I cook with these same ingredients at home regularly so I appreciate quality of ingredients and they have Newport rent to pay. That said, I really really really did not appreciate when they nickel and dime you to add insult to injury. Their rotis are “dry” in order to be vegan: that means no ghee. If I’m ordering them traditionally for my KIDS, don’t be cheap, and charge me for spreading a dollop of ghee on them. That really is in bad taste: the opposite of positive vibes and nirvana of the healing food. It’s crossing a line, made me feel like all the money I do spend here isn’t valued, and left us with an ill feeling - no goodwill with my kids food: I can’t come here or visit again. Yes the food is healthy and simple, but feeding with a big heart and a loving heart so receiver receives the energy of the food they consume is also an extremely key and important component of the entire Ayurvedic nutrition concept which they dropped the ball on. An opportunity missed.< /text>< pictures>

{'time': 1620163143221, 'text': 'Hi Natasha Pancholi-Khatod.  I’m sorry you were upset we did not give you ghee for free.\n\nIt is hard to imagine, that of all the places you go to, Nourish is the one you felt compelled to vent your 1-star they-didn’t-do-enough-for-me anger upon.   Of all the toxicity in the world we live in and must deal with all day, you chose us to try to spread your unhappiness to; the only restaurant you’ve probably ever been to whose purpose isn’t entirely about making a financial profit selling you food.   A restaurant set up as a non-profit: to serve healing organic food, cooked personally by a professional Ayurvedic Chef and healer, and to serve and feed the soul of our community.  A restaurant where the owners work every day, personally cooking and serving all the food for you, and where we counsel our regulars about food,  health and life.  A restaurant where I volunteer full time for free, to make it all happen.  A restaurant you eat at “regularly and recommend often.”\n\nAnd why again is Nourish a 1-star restaurant?  Because, for whatever unknown reason, you did not want to pay for your ghee?\n\nYou do not need to appreciate that we offer speciality organic ingredients and different specialty dishes every day that aren’t available at any restaurant I know of in this entire country. Or that we are one of the only authentic Ayurvedic restaurants in the entire country and we have one of the few truly professional Ayurvedic chefs in this country, who moved to Orange County as a service to help with the food consciousness here.  You don’t need to appreciate that all of our food is made with purified, mineralized, re-structured water, and that we make our ghee ourselves from scratch from organic, pasture-raised, Strauss Butter while playing holy mantras.  That we stone-grind our own flour fresh each morning from organic ancient-grain Kamut wheat grains. Or that we pay twice as much for compostable disposables or that we try to pay our workers better wages. We know that most will not recognize the differences and that we cannot charge more for many of these things, but we do them anyway, because we believe in them and it is our offering to the universe.\n\nBut having to deal with reviews like this is, nonetheless, always disheartening and disappointing.\n\nI’m sorry you won’t be coming in any longer Natasha.\n\nAll the best,\nJohn'}<//resp>

Was surprised they managed to make such a delightful blend of textures and flavors with seemingly simple ingredients. Well done. Great place for foodies.

Pricey for the amount of food - portions aren't tiny but they're not very filling and after 2 sushi plates and half an appetizer I was hungry a couple hours later.< /review>

<review>Nourish is amazing!! My family and I love them so much: the atmosphere, people, and of course, the food are all wonderful. Usually we get the Nourishing plate and their samosas, which are always fresh and flavorful. We recently had their breakfast burritos and we are in love! And their chai is always exactly what we’re looking for: both sweet and spicy.

<Text>I have been there numerous times. Im really not in to vegan but I do like vegetarian food. The staff is just OK. The problem is that the food is very simple Indian style food and extremely expensive ! A bowl of vegetables and rice, muffin and chai tea will run you about $22 ! They say they are a non profit ! really</Text>< pics>

I’m sorry that you find our food “extremely expensive.” Though, as Nourish is significantly less expensive than every single other restaurant in Orange County that serves comparable, freshly made, all-organic food, I am curious what you mean by that?\n\nAs there are also no other Ayurvedic restaurants in OC, and no other restaurants that serve the variety and quality of specialty vegetarian dishes that Nourish does, at any price, I wonder how Nourish could be ‘expensive' relative to other restaurants that don't actually exist?\n\nAs for the specific cost of our all-organic Nourishing Bowl, Chai and Muffin, that you mention, let’s go through them…\n\nOur Nourishing Meal Bowl…\ncosts $12. Every comparable, high quality, organic meal in all Southern California costs at least 20%-50% more that that. Even Chipotle’s Vegetarian fast-food Bowl with guacamole costs $9.50. How much, Mark, should our Nourishing Bowl cost, when our exquisite organic cuisine is already generously priced closely to a bowl of fast-food rice, beans, salsa and guacamole?\n\nHow much should we charge for our Organic Indian Basmati Rice, which costs us 149% more than conventional, Cal-rose rice; or for our speciality organic vegetables, like bitter mellon, okra or bottle gourd, and which cost us anywhere from 25%-200% more than non-organic, common vegetables and which we make fresh from scratch every day? Is it worth something to you that they are hand-made each day by a professional Ayurvedic chef? Is it worth something to you that we use no pre-made, canned or re-heated food? Is it worth something that we offer different organic vegetable dishes EVERY day, based on what is fresh and in-season at the farmers market?  Is it worth something that they are cooked with purified, mineralized water and organic sunflower oil, in a clean, matra-infused kitchen, and served on dish-ware in a peaceful cafe?\n\nOur authentic Chai…\ncosts $5. Our chai happens be almost the exact same price and the same size as our strip-center neighbor Starbuck’s “chai.” Our chai is authentically made fresh each morning by simmering fresh organic ginger, whole organic spices and organic Assam tea from India, in purified, mineralized, re-structured water. It is the only authentically made, plant-based chai anywhere in OC and many say it's the best chai they ever had. Starbuck’s chai is made with tap water and 4 pumps of chai syrup from a plastic bottle, literally. The organic spices alone in our chai probably cost 20x more than Starbuck’s syrup squirts.  Are you saying we should charge less than Starbuck's chai-flavored water, Mark?\n\nAs for our Muffins…\nThey cost $4. Our other strip center neighbor, French’s Bakery, offers muffins for $3.25. Ours are made from organic, ancient-grain Kamut, which costs us 250% more than conventional flour. Theirs, which I’m sure are very good, use conventional white flour and processed white sugar, and none of the ingredients are organic. Should we charge less for our specialty organic muffins? Is it worth something that we also stone-grind our ancient-grain Kamut fresh each morning, or that we sweeten our muffins mostly with organic apple sauce instead processed sugar? Is it worth something that there is not a single muffin of comparable quality in all of OC?\n\nRather than being 'expensive,' Mark, I think our extraordinarily low prices must have confused you into comparing the highest quality, highest integrity organic food you may have ever eaten, with cheap fast food prices.  I would instead suggest that when you consider everything that goes into our healing cuisine, Nourish may indeed be the best deal in the whole world.\n\nUnfortunately, I have run out of allowed characters, but if you're interested, Mark, you’re welcome to come by Nourish to chat about the satisfaction I have gotten from working full-time for free, at a public benefit, non-profit restaurant (501c3, EIN 82-5006680) dedicated to serving and bring higher food consciousness to our community — including you, Mark.\nWarmly,\nJohn"}<//Response>< GmapID>

<Review>The food is definitely saatvik and it is nutritious. The variety in the plate is impressive too. However, I would say that the flavors are slightly on the muted side. I would go back but mainly for health reasons and not for the taste.< /Review>< pictures>

<Resp>{'time': 1579218150905, 'text': "Thanks Sameer.  I'm glad you'll be coming back.  Yes, as an Ayurvedic restaurant, the food is meant to nourish and balance --  physically, mentally and spiritually.  As noted on the menu and the website and the poster on the back wall, and as Prakash talked to you about, our food is prepared mildly spiced and mildly salted.   Since many of our guests come to us seeking the highest quality food, that is balanced and not overly salty, oily or spicy like most restaurant food, we consciously give our guests the option to add these things to their own taste.\n\nMost of our guests and our many 5-star reviewers love the delicious, subtle, perfectly-balanced flavors of our food, but we do also offer various sauces and salt and pepper, to suit every taste.   And luckily for you, it's much easier to add these flavors and tastes than to try to remove them.  If you did not try our different sauces, I encourage you to re-evaluate your experience of our incredible variety of daily, hand-cooked, organic, farmer's market, vegetable dishes, having adjusted the flavors to your particular taste.\n\nBlessings,\nJohn"}</Resp>< Gmap_id>

This place is nice and clean. Food tastes great. But every time they mess up my order. Hopefully they will find a sync between counter and kitchen. They food is expensive like any other organic store.

Dear owner,

Thank you for reading  and commenting.

I wish I could show you my earlier rating which was 4. I have been to your place more than 6 times with family or office colleagues. Every time, there was some issue with the order. That’s why I changed to 2 rating. I promise next time you fix my order I will change it to 4 star. Cheers!</Review>

{'time': 1579295333059, 'text': 'Hi Rakesh.   I\'m glad you find the food tastes great and the restaurant is nice and clean.\nI\'m sorry we did not get your order right.  I know it can be frustrating when someone gets your order wrong.  We always try to keep working toward perfect, but naturally we are only human, and our best is all we can offer.  Though if a simple mixed up order causes you to rate a restaurant you find "nice and clean" with food that "tastes great", with only 2-stars, I wonder what rating we would get if our food didn\'t taste so great and the restaurant wasn\'t so nice.\n\n————\n\nThanks Rakesh.  I hear you.  Would you mind coming in to introduce yourself and telling me and the team of your experiences, so we can learn from it?  I’ll buy your meal for your time.\nBest,\nJohn'}<//Response>

Amazing food. We were passing thru from Santa Barbara on our way down to SD. We came for Breakfast and got the Veggie Crepe and the Nourish Breakfast which is Dal with idli’s. We were searching for South Indian style food and were pleased to find this healthy place. If only other restaurants could follow their example .... So many fresh vegetables! And the water is so pure tasting and restructured. The Chef Prakash is so friendly and he sat with us after our meal and shared his wisdom with us. Very enjoyable experience, we plan to be back next time we’re in OC.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The cuisine is Indian, but unobtrusive in terms of spices. Everything is balanced, tasty and varied. There is no onion and garlic in the dishes - this is a big plus for many vegetarians.

(Original)
Кухня индийская, но ненавязчивая в плане специй. Всё сбалансированно, вкусно и разнообразно. Нет лука и чеснока в блюдах - это большой плюс для многих вегетарианцев.< /Review>

Everyone is friendly, wanting to make sure I've felt pampered and that my needs have been met. Felicia has been a fabulous massage therapist/healer. Love her energy and powerful hands!!  You ladies are all the BEST!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>I really wish I had asked the spelling of her name but, Carrie, you were outstanding. I have gone to the Palladio location in the past and I have NEVER received a service like that. I came in Monday morning for a sports blend and the staff up front was warm welcoming and professional. Carrie did not rush me, she took her time in the areas where I told her were my problem zones, she used more than one heated towel and just showed perfect etiquette. She is amazing and I needed that massage to be perfect after my last experience at Palladio. I will continue coming to Roseville for my future massages and will absolutely be asking for Carrie. I hope your supervisor sees this and knows that you do an exceptional job at what you do. Thanks.<//Review>< Rate>

If you want to pamper yourself, definitely check out Serenity. I’ve had the best massage and facials here. They start you off in a relaxing waiting area. I love the decor and the beds are super comfy. I feel like a had all my questions answered by Amy before and after my facial. My skin is vastly improving thanks to her. My first visit included lunch and the food is amazing. I highly recommend Serenity spa<//text>

I wanted this massage for the health  benefits I got after India that lasted about three months. However, I'd recommend to tell her not to do the toe and finger pull move. My index and thumbs on both hands are strained, and I'm typing this with my others fingers. Very painful. Four stars because it was otherwise fine and don't want to imply she was mean.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x809b1fd75936bfc5:0x830e26d087f4b39d< /GmapID></record>

<name>Aelita Tyukayeva</name><Date>1566869131498<//Date><Rate>1<//Rate><review>The reviews convinced me to choose this spa for a very much needed prenatal massage at 38weeks. I’ve had a lot of massages in my lifetime and have never needed to leave a review but this experience was just awful. The spa itself seemed nice, receptionists were friendly. The issue was my masseuse and lack of follow up I was promised. I DO NOT recommend Rebecca C. The first thing I told her prior to the appointment was that my back and hips were hurting and I really wanted her to focus on those areas. She did not. In fact it almost seemed like she avoided them focusing on my hands instead. She COMPLETELY forgot to do one shoulder and I had to ask her to massage it like I was asking for a favor. When asked about the temperature, I mentioned I was a bit chilly at which point she turned on the heating pad. Toward the end I was very cold and had mentioned it again and she covered one shoulder with the sheet instead of maybe turning up the heat? I left with my back hurting just as much as when I came and was told the manager would call me to talk about the experience. She did not. The spa might be nice, I got a fancy chocolate covered pineapple slice at the end but even that could not make up for the WORST massage of my life.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I went here Monday for a 12 pm couples deep tissue massage. The experience was overall very relaxing. My boyfriend enjoyed his massage and said it helped a lot, however, unfortunately my experience was not the same. My massage was lackluster and I have experienced better ones at massage envy. Im not sure if my therapist, Justine, was having an off day or if she lacks experience but it left much to be desired. I requested that my upper back, shoulders and neck received extra attention. That being said that was not the case, I feel like my overall experience was rushed. For instance, when my boyfriends back was still being worked on I was flipped over to the front for what I can assume was about 10-15 minutes before he had been. I don’t mean to complain but I left extremely unsatisfied with a very small chance of returning. If I do return I will be requesting someone else. I do not think I received the care that I had paid for. Aside from that, the spa does seem to be relaxing and has a great atmosphere and was its only redemption in my opinion. To be fair, I can do without the scents and atmosphere as long as my massage is well worth it.<//Text>

The front counter staff ladies were amazing! I’m in the customer service industry as well and we have a 10 second rule but these ladies have a 1 second rule to greet customers. Super sweet and smiles all the way around. I got a mommy to be massage first massage in over 10 years. It was an amazing experience. Denice was awesome and really made me feel relaxed. I will definitely be returning this experience was great!</text>

<text>Serenity Spa is aptly named because serenity is what is achieved when coming here.  The smells and sounds are so relaxing and the employees are welcoming. Every time I walk through the door, I’m greeted by name and with a genuine smile. The Zen lounge is beautifully decorated and tucked away in it’s own little alcove.

I love that the yoga classes are more than just  a workout.  The yoga teachers teach about mindfulness and the union of the mind, body & spirit.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I am proud to say I have been an active client at Serenity Soul and Spa for the past three years. The place is simply amazing and is more like home than anything. Olivia is my massage therapist and she is just awesome. She always listens carefully to the areas I need to focus on and provides feedback. I highly recommend her!<//review>

I always enjoy going to Serenity Spa. I receive the best massages from Anne. I leave feeling wonderfully  energized. If I have a physical issue, she addresses it. The atmosphere is calm and relaxing, and the staff is very courteous and friendly. They actually address you by your name. I cannot recommend Serenity Spa enough. It’s the best around.<//review>

Had a girlfriend spa day. This is a beautiful, peaceful spa. From the moment we stepped in the staff was friendly and inviting. Started with a foot bath in a comfy massage chair. The care given by Ann was special with soft washing, warm towels, and hot tea. Then off to a massage in a warm softly lit room. Again Ann was awesome. Finally we shared a delicious lunch chosen from an interesting menu. Loved it all and will definitely return<//text>

I went here for a prenatal massage and it was amazing! They went above and beyond my expectations. From the moment you walk in, you feel relaxed and that feeling continues the entire time. Even the restrooms are calming. My massouse Sharon was great, the time went by way too fast. At the end they leave you to relax and redress with no hurry. They bring you a warm wet towel to wash off any oil if you'd like, as well as a water and even a chocolate covered pineapple to top it all off. I will definitely be going here again!< /Text>

One of the best spa experiences in the area. The staff is awsome and my masseuse Donna had the hands of a goddess. This place helps me re-center myself. I have already scheduled my next visit.< /text>

< Review>
For the most part our experience was really good. The rooms are inviting and relaxing. Loved the robes and drinks we were offered.  My husband and I were excited to celebrate our anniversary and get a chance to relax so we booked a 45 min foot treatment and 60 min massage that included a light dinner afterwards.  On the forms to fill out my husband and I both put firm pressure.  I was a bit confused during the foot treatment as the only feedback that was asked was if the water was a good temp. I didn’t realize till after that it should have been an actual massage because my therapist was using really really light pressure. As we transitioned into the massage she did say that any time I need more pressure or lighter to let her know. I had to ask 3 or 4 times for more pressure and felt uncomfortable doing it in the first place (more my problem than hers). My husband too was a bit shy and never asked but afterwards said he should have asked for lighter pressure from his therapist. I don’t think either of us would have been uncomfortable if they had just asked during the massage if it was the right pressure. We also felt kind of rushed after the massage because I think they forgot to get our dinner order before so we rushed to get dressed and fill out our order just to go wait till our food was done. I think it would have been more relaxing if we could have taken a bit more time to sit and relax before changing and waiting for our food if our order had been taken before the massage. For the most part we felt very relaxed after and would still consider giving it another try.< /Review>

<Review>Super cute yoga shirt. Just wish the pants size didn’t run so small. There’s not a lot of large. i normally wear md. But they are so tight. Maybe it’s the new thing with tummy tuck being so popular in sports fashion. Oh well. Cute products and worth the the price for the quality< /Review>< Pics>

The experience was wonderful frim the moment I walked in! The decor was breathtaking, the team was gracious and the quality of the services was top notch. You can feel the passion for creating a holistic experience for self care.  I can't wait to go back and will definitely add a yoga class.< /Review>

I have been going to Serenity Spa since their original location.  The staff is warm and personable yet very professional.  The Spa is decorated beautifully, very peaceful environment.  The massage therapist have all been very good, wanting to ensure that I got a great massage with the right pressure, etc...  I would highly recommend Serenity Spa, you will not be disappointed!  I'm just sad that since we've moved I have to try to find a Spa just as good...<//Review>

First visit several weeks ago. Started with warm greetings from delightful attendants in an entry / gallery filled with beautiful crystals, stones, woodwork, unique art pieces, all adding up to a wonderful feeling of bliss and peacefulness, then on to my appointment for a massage with Rebecca. In no time at all  I found my self robed in oomfort, sitting in a meditative room with her massaging and soothing my feet in a bowl of warm ingredients / oils <of type>  while getting them massaged...great way to start what became an invigorating full body massage. This spa is very aptly named the Serenity Spa for a reason...it's the way you feel when you are finished. Thanks again for a great experience.  J. Brown</review>

<Text>My boyfriend and I went in for a couples massage recently.  This rating is on his behalf for other couples.  He was asked what type of massage he would like then asked for deep tissue.  He also stated he would like the massage to start as firm as possible.  During the experience the girl massaging him did not ask him how the pressure was at all or communicate with him.  He left being charged more for a deep tissue massage that was never received.
From my experience, it was lovely.  JC does an amazing job and is great at staying in communication on how things are going.  If you go, ask for her!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

This is an update from an earlier review.  I had gone in for a facial and while the esthetician had good technique, the products used didn't work well for my skin care needs.  I later received a call from the manager, who offered to make it right if I'd give them another chance.  I went back for a second time and had a wonderful experience.  The esthetician (Amy) took time to listen to my skin concerns and catered the facial accordingly.  My skin felt great throughout the treatment and afterward.  I'm very impressed by the exemplary level of customer service and follow up to make me a happy customer, and my skin is happy too!</text>

What I like about this place is that before your massage you get into your robe and they wash your feet and a nice relaxing room. After the massage your given a nice refreshing tray,  that comes with the chocolate covered fruit & a hot towel & water.

What I didn’t like about my first time experience was that  during my massage the masseur decided to do some energy/spirit meditation  (or whatever you called it) on me.  When I  told him I don’t want that done he responded that I had some trauma that I’m not ready to deal with.. ummm no  I signed up for massage nothing else!

Also thought I’d mention this because never in all my years of getting a massage did I have the inside of my ears massaged.</review>

<Review>I have been to many, many spas. This place has no zen qualities. It is difficult to enjoy a massage when you can hear nothing but chatter from the front desk staff. My massage therapist had to go out and quiet them! Then she had to turn up the music. I paid for a foot massage in their "zen" lounge. While I was getting it, 4 other people were there too talking loudly, one on the phone. Then some women came in and ate their lunch there too! Ridiculous. Their was no changing rooms or place to store your stuff, you are given a basket. This so called zen lounge has windows open to the public! Seriously...how can you call this place a spa. They need to reconfigure their space. The two staff members I had were amazing. They should go work somewhere where their talents can be shown off properly.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I absolutely love my time at Serenity Spa. The second I walk through the door you feel a very peaceful positive environment. I have had facials & massages all preformed by trained professionals. I especially enjoy when I can have mother/daughter time. Massage/lunch/facial. everyone is accommodating and knowledgeable.</review>

I had the most amazing facial and soul to sole foot massage. It was a Mother's Day gift from my children that I finally was able to use. I loved it so much, I scheduled another facial appointment. It was wonderfully relaxing to be pampered and my skin looked so youthful.< /Text>

Every time I visit Serenity, I never want to leave. The ambiance and service is always top notch. Lauren is an AMAZING esthetician! Our massages were wonderful, also. Definitely leave with your chakras aligned.< /Text>

< Review>
Recently, I brought Julie, my 90 year old stepmother from Mt View, to Roseville for a visit.  She wanted to see the Spa, which I rave so much about, and she asked me to schedule a massage for her.  She had not had a massage in over 10 years.  Rebecca was so patient, and treated her so special that she is still raving about the massage and next visit she plans on requesting a 90 minute massage with her. Rebecca, I cannot thank you enough for the pleasure and comfort you provided my sweet Julie.
She wanted to have another treatment at the spa, to visit the quiet and comforting environment at the Spa.  Therefore, we scheduled her first facial....in 90 years...with Olivia.  Olivia could not have been kinder or treated her better.  Yes again, Julie told me that during her next visit she plans to schedule a 90 minute facial with Olivia.  Olivia, thank you for giving Julie her first facial....and providing her with such a warm and comforting experience.
Felicia is my massage therapist and is truly a miracle worker. She is the only therapist who is able to consistently work miracles with my neck!    She is truly a magical angel in disguise.  Felicia, thank you!

Tammie, consistent kindness, care, and respect is a gift your entire staff offers your clients each and every day; your spa is a blessing to us all!  Thank you and Namaste.< /Review>

I have been going to Serenity for a very long time. Went to them when they were also on sierra College Blvd. I enjoy my massages and facials there.

I will say that one time in 2014 it was a bit noisy outside of my massage room and that was distracting. Hope that has been taken care of!

Such an amazing experience. Had a spa party here with 7 of us and We had a blast. I coordinated with Chelsea and she was so nice and did everything to accommodate us. We rented the Zen room, which was really nice, relaxing, and private. We each got a 90 min Swedish massage and 90 min facials, which were great.

Massage: I had Olivia and she was amazing. I asked for light-medium pressure and she was spot on. Her technique was awesome and slightly different than what I’ve had before. It was so fluid and at times I felt like I had multiple hands massaging me, which was SO relaxing.

Facial: wasn’t sure what to expect during a 90 min facial since it’s quite long but it was great. Had the usual steam, extractions, exfoliation, and face masks. I also got a scalp, neck and shoulder, and foot massage while the masks were on. I dozed off a few times during the foot massage because it was so relaxing. Only thing is my esthetician didn’t say what she was using on my face, which I’m okay with but I know some people prefer to know each step, which I’m sure you can ask for that. Afterwards my skin was really soft and more glowy.

Overall it was such an amazing experience. I’m so glad we picked Serenity Spa. Everyone loved it and we would all go back!</review>

<UserId.>106360344889287438160</UserId.><review>For my birthday I booked exactly what I wanted. The rainforest waterfall massage with the Indian Head massage. First I have to say, I'm impressed with the look and feel of this spa. All staff was friendly. I was given some refreshing citrus water, and I waited in a comfortable room for my therapist. Desiree was fun, helpful, and man does she know her job well. She was very intuitive to what my back needed, and I really loved that she stretched my back to really work my problem areas. The aroma therapy was on point, and the warm water rinse with my scrub was so relaxing. I've never heared of a rainforest massage, but now I don't understand why more salons don't offer it. I usually leave spas tired and defeated. I left today feeling invigorated and energized. Price is what you can expect from a spa this nice, will definitely be back and I'll definitely be asking for Desiree.<//review>< Pics>

My experience at Serenity has always been wonderful. Everyone from the receptionist to my masseuse or facialist have been awesome. I always come out rested and relaxed. Sometimes I wish I can stay a little longer to keep that momentum going...lol. They are #1 on my list and my husbands. We are so grateful to find a place close to home.</review>

Im a jeweler so I have a lot of aches and pains but after Desiree got done with me I feel SOO much better  I haven't slept so good in a long time and had no aches and pains today.

HelloTech experience was horrible.

I bought a wall mount from Walmart.  I paid Walmart to have the wall mount attached to the wall in the bedroom.  Walmart contracted HelloTech to do the job.

I showed the HelloTech tech the wall mount I had purchased and showed him where to mount it in the bedroom.  I also told him that the TV in the kitchen will go to the bedroom and a new TV will go in the kitchen.  He did NOT tell us that was not what he was going to do.  Instead he just attached the new TV to the existing wall mount in the kitchen.

Then he said he needed to go to Home Depot to get some tools to install the wall mount in the bedroom.  He never came back.  I found out later he had marked the job completed.  He never installed the wall mount to the bedroom wall - which is what I had paid for.  And he lied to us about going to Home Depot to get tools.< /review>

Plus, his installation and choice of the camera angles to cover the correct areas was perfect. Great job! Thank you!</Text>

<review>Tom is AWESOME! He did an amazing job mounting the 75” TV and help us figure out the positioning of TV because we needed some guidance. Great experience overall! He left enough room to install a soundbar, so when we do get one, I will be calling him for installation. Thank you Tom for your exceptional services!< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>3</Rate><review>Our experience wasn’t the best but got better later. My husband omitted a television to be hung so the tech called to add it. That resulted in hundreds of dollars in extra charges that we weren’t planning. You all charged us $79 EACH to dismount 2 televisions, but my husband had to help dismount them! Why are we paying to assist in something you all are charging us for? It’s the same with mounting. You all are charging us fees to HELP mount televisions! And the charges were different for each television to be mounted. The tech became combative and threatened to leave the job when I asked for clarification on the charges. I didn’t like his attitude and his tone. He later apologized for the incident.

Also, my husband asked the tech to connect our Apple TV box, and he mentioned not needing it because of the app that is offered. It’s not the same. For us to get our local channels, we need the Apple TV box. So, my husband and I had to dismount our television over the fireplace, connect the box and remount the tv! The whole experience was a waste of our time and money.

We don’t plan to utilize your services again and we will not recommend anyone to do so.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf2ab642d0f1:0xc62376e2f1ae36de</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>The tech was nice enough but if he wouldnt have called we wouldn't have even known he was with HelloTech. Not to mention the mounting job he did was awkward. The ceilings are pretty tall and he had the TV almost touching the ceiling. He didn't ask where we wanted it mounted or how high. I will give him credit we called him back and he has returned to fix the job that could have been correct the first time.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><userid>103783692560409662899< /userid><user_name>Jakob Emswiler</user_name></record></dataset><record>

My PC crashed and I'm hundreds of miles away from the company I built my PC with and so upon typing "Geek squad" into my search engine,
an ad came up about Tulare's own geeks from HelloTech. The tech, Freddie, who was sent to my house was not only thorough, quick confident, didn't waste any time getting to the resolution of my PC issues! It's always the end of the world for me whenever my PC crashes or won't boot into Windows due to the lack of technical knowledge so thank you Freddie for getting my PC back up and running and even quicker!</review>

I went online, found HelloTech, and they seemed to have good ratings. I scheduled a request for an appointment online and gave a bunch of times I was available. The tech called me within an hour or so and was available later that afternoon in a few hours. He came and was wearing a mask, I was wearing a mask and had wiped down surfaces and my phone with a disinfectant wet wipe and socially distanced. He helped setup my new WiFi network mesh and checked to make sure our devices could connect and it worked. He checked our internet speed and answered many questions, and was gone in about an hour. Great find! Perfect for anyone who doesn’t want to spend an afternoon fretting about how to set up a WiFi, Ring doorbell, or a security or smart home system. I’d use them again over Geek Squad for sure.<//review>< Pictures>

The technician was very professional and he went the extra mile to show me how to work the television and paired it to my cable box, and sound bar. He hid the unsightly wires. My Technician was named Richard. Mr. Richard made sure the television was leveled, and because I am in a new home he made sure the brick would hold the television he took measurements before drilling holes in the brick, he also made sure the brick would not crumble because of the drilling. I would highly recommend this company, and my technician.👍🏽< /review>

James was amazing. Turns out a portion of ports were dead in receiver. James found a work around by running a 3.5 jack to RCA' in the aux port. That workaround saved me from replacing a $1000 receiver. He gave everything a once over in the system to make sure everything worked as it did before I had the problem that required the service from James.</text>

Our technician Chris K. Went above and beyond to make sure everything was perfect!
I absolutely recommend Hello Tech and will use them in the future!<//review>

Hilton was a great professional and very respectful of my home and family. He mounted both of my TV's as if it were his own. His attention to detail and need to be sure of my satisfaction made the experience well worth the cost. I would invite him back to my home for future services with no hesitation.</Review>

Fast, friendly, precise service! Very pleased, wore his mask. Our tech educated us on the correct mount for our walls so our tv was mounted safely and securely after a second mount purchase.  Was considerate in showing me mount heights before installing. Even took the empty box to the trash for me! Would highly recommend !< /review>

Only place in a 3 hour radius to get me the tires I wanted. They gave me a good deal and a warranty. Can't ask for anything else. Very knowledgeable and patient sat down with me to get rims to match. Also installed a 4in rough country lift. Pictures to come< /Text>

There are so many tire shops in lodi and after talking to a few of them I'm happy I ended up here. The employees are super friendly and actually knew what they were talking about, got a great deal on a new set of tires and had my front struts replaced. The Toyota dealership wanted a fortune and I saved a ton by coming here. They weren't busy and I was in and out quicker than I expected. Friendly people and great service.</review>

<Text>I had a wobble in my tires over 65 mph and I wasn't sure if it was just balancing or what it was. I brought it into these guys Adam and Abe were very helpful and professional. They were able to address my issue in a very quick manner, the price was fair and the service was great. They provide services for suspension alignment and tires and rims. I would recommend them any day.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

This place is the best! Adam who works there was super super helpful!! I was dealing with a bunch of run around from AAA on trying to get my RV tires fixed... it took over a week and in the end AAA didn’t get the job done, Adam at Dave’s shop did. He turned my frustrating AAA experience into a helpful process through great communication, helping find solutions, and really caring about the customer, not too mention, super fast and efficient too!</review>

< review>
I drive a bmw 750 li and Made my way to davids quality tire yesterday, only because my favorite tire shop [A1 tire] did not have my tire size in stock. I was looking for used tires to use temporarily until I had my suspension repaired next week. A young man came out and told me they have 245/45/20 that would fit the front of my car, I told them I'm not sure if that would fit. They guaranteed it would.
Here's where it gets pretty scary
They told me it would be 160 dollars.
I've never paid more than 35 to 40 dollars for a used tire.
I asked to see what tires they were planing on selling me.
They rolled them out and I was offended. The front tires were around 3 or 4/32nds of tread left The rear was offensive. It probably had 1 or 2/32nds of tread left.
I told them I am not okay with these tires. They rolled out new ones that had slightly more tread.
But then preceded to tell me these cost more valued at 170!
At this point I'm blown away. They started telling me I had to pay disposal fees if I use my bank card but if I pay cash I would not have to pay them.
Unbelievable.
I've never paid disposal fees on any used tire. Ever.
They changed their price after I started to walk away to 140 even. I said fine because I had to leave to Vegas that night and my time was running thin.
Now it gets even worse.
I drove home and I was getting all kinds of dashboard lights on my car. So I get out and inspect the tires.
MY STRUTS WERE RESTING ON TOP OF THE TIRE. THEY NEVER TOLD ME IT THEY DONT ACTUALLY FIT. NOW IM HAVING A TON OF ISSUES. I CALLED THEM AND TOLD THEM THIS SO THEY SAID I HAD TO PAY MORE TO SWITCH IT TO THE TIRE SIZE I ORIGINALLY ASKED FOR!!!  NOT TO MENTION THEY PUT MY DIRECTIONAL TIRE ON BACKWARDS!!!
NOW I AM HAVING ALL SHORTS OF ISSUES WITH MY CAR AFTER GETTING MY TIRES INSTALLED HERE. THIS WAS THE ONLY TIRE SHOP I HAD SHOPPED AT THAT MADE ME SIGN A WAIVER WHEN I PURCHASED FROM THEM. If they make you sign a waiver you should be concerned for you safety..
I'm not happy about this.<//review>

< Review>
Bad service and poor work ethic. After replacing our front ends steering and suspension components on a company vehicle we took it  into David's tires on Friday to have an alignment done to not only ensure the alignment was done properly and the vehicle was safe to drive but to also support local small businesses being we are a local small business ourselves. Over the weekend there were some loud noises coming from the front end and the steering wheel became off center. When we brought the truck back theywere very short about the whole situation and refused to address the issue saying "we didn't touch anything on that side of the truck" this was clearly an alignment issue. Now after years of service we will no longer be returning to David's tires . Were currently at les schwaabb and they will be our new gk to guys.</Review>

Let me start with this place is awesome with some great guys. They really went beyond what they do to make sure I was happy. I did my 2020 tundra 7” lift with 37” wheels and tires. The truck looks amazing. They even washed my truck for free just as courtesy. Great guys! Great shops! Definitely my place to go to if I need any work done on my truck. Thank you Dave!</Text>

We were traveling from out of town and tire pressure light came on, pulled right into this shop. We were greeted by 3 employees ready to help. They checked the pressure, took off the tire and made sure that we didn’t have a problem. Five minutes later we were back on the road. Excellent customer service! Highly recommend!!</text>

I typically don’t write reviews for tire shops but this place really took care of all my cars needs. Not only did they get me reliable tires; they were the best price out there and best quality as well. While I was there I seen they work on things other than tires and hooked up a lifted tundra truck. Will be bringing all my cars here for all my car needs.<//review>

We stopped in Lodi on our way to Oregon and needed to replace a tire on our tow Jeep. We were Referred to Dave’s tires and wheels and they were able to get us in first thing in the morning, replace the tire, and were extremely helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend this place! Price good tire, good price, good people!< /Text>

<Review>I recently visited David’s Quality tire because my back two tires were completely bald and wires were showing. They checked out the front tires and to be honest I thought like anyone else would at a car place they’d tell me i needed new ones but they didn’t they were up front and honest and told me that I could rotate those to the back. They then made sure I had a nice alignment so that it wouldn’t happen again. As I was leaving they heard my brakes squeaking which was an annoying problem I was having and they gave me a really competitive quote to have them replaced. I came back a few days later when my brakes came in and again was greeted by Abed and he was really cool and made sure that I was taken care of properly. His dad did my brakes and I haven’t had an issue with them squeaking since. They have definitely gained a lifetime customer for all of my car needs.</Review>< Pics>

The new owners of David‘s Tire Shop had the 13 inch tires that we needed, and couldn’t find anywhere else.   They were polite, friendly,  honest, and incredibly helpful.  The price was reasonable and they guaranteed their product and work.</text>

Had a blow out on my car looked up for a place close by found David’s tires. They had multiple choices for new and used which other shops I’ve been to in Lodi Barely have any. The guys who helped me were very kind and respectful. Got a killer deal on some new tires and brakes. Will Definitely definitely be coming here for any of my tire needs and recommend them to anyone who needs anything tire related. One thing forget to mention that I liked that they were very honest and upfront about what they were selling. They show you everything not like other shady shops in Lodi. Best place in town I repeat don’t go anywhere else<//review>

<Text>You are the one that should be educating customers not the other way around.
I did not specifically request that size. I asked the employees if it would fit and they guaranteed it would fit. I believe the gentlemens name was Adam  he kept telling me how much extra space I have in my wheel well
When I got home my struts were resting on the tire and according to davids tire and wheel, that fits? also incorrect, A1 makes me sign no waiver, Firestone, America's tire, Bridgestone  all no waiver
ive read the fine print on yours the fine print that doesn't exist on any other shops receipts . Because they know they are going to do it right with the customers safety being the number one concern. And if they do something wrong they are ready to deal with the ramifications to make it right.
Not to mention I dont know How can you even justify your crew putting a DIRECTIONAL tire on BACKWARDS,  you simply just look at an arrow to on the outside of the tire to know to which way it goes on. Complete disregard. THESE ARE PEOPLES LIVES YOU ARE PLAYING WITH.
Not to mention I had to have both of the front tires you sold me repaired the next day because they both had leaks!< /Text>< gmap_id>

Don't know why I wasted my time driving with a way out to the shop to get a set a used truck tires they were pretty bald to begin with but I needed something quick got home tried to mount them and there was a few nails in the tires that I didn't see, That part is my fault but why when I called him and told him about it he said just bring them back and he'll refund me... Seems to me that he knew that they were in there and he should have never sold the tires to begin with.<//Review>

BEWARE - Using these guys is a gamble..These guys sold me a used tired that went flat because of a nail - not their fault.  I couldn't get the tire off using a 130lb torque wrench because the lug nuts were on there so tight - their fault.  When I towed it to David's, they told me they weren't responsible and couldn't help me in Lodi but I could have it towed to another one of their garbage dump shops in Elk Grove where they could chisel it off.  I can do that on my own!   Not to mention that during a previous experience I showed up at 4:40pm because the other used tire they sold me wouldn't hold air and he said I'd have to come back tomorrow!  I drove to and from Tracy that night having to stop and put air in the tire.  The next morning - you guessed it!  They told me the tire was no good, didn't have a warranty and had to be replaced!  I immediately took the vehicle to Pep Boys and bought new tires there because I was so p****d...It's my own fault for going after a good price but hopefully someone else will learn from my mistakes. This is the second shop that I've had shady issues with and there just certain people that should be avoided when getting automotive work done.  I'd been going there for years and none of that mattered.  Nickel and dime con-artists that won't get another dime from me...< /Text>

These guys are inexperienced, dishonest and shady.
Spend your hard earned money elsewhere,  there’s plenty of tire stores on every street!

Needed a tire really fast and i had to call because it was closing time.  He was willing to wait for me and when i got there it took just minutes and I was back on the road again.  Definitely would recommend this shop!<//Review>

<text>Love their chicken! Just drive by the neighborhood and your nose will have you turning into the parking lot to get some. Honestly, I could skip the rice, beans, and tortillas they give you and just eat 3 or 4 pieces of chicken. It's that good.

The tri tip is another winner. I took visiting family there and that's the only thing they wanted to eat the entire time they were here.

The burritos are also good, but they are huge! I usually eat half and take the other half home for another meal.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Wonderfully average. Not bad, but not the best. It’s good when you need something quick and don’t want to wait<//Review>

"If it ain't broke, don't fix it" seems to be a fitting motto for the SB Chicken Ranch. This casual local walk-up Mexican style BBQ joint has been serving from the same simple menu for decades, and yet, like In and Out Burger, people still come in droves to get their favorite dish. The service is quick, the food is plentiful, and the salsa bar is always free.< /Text>

Food is good. The fact that they on 2/1/21 are letting customers walk around inside talking on the phone without a mask on while drinking beer and coughing and not a single employee does anything... that's disgusting.<//Text>

This was my first time here and I honestly did not know how fast the line would go. Fast forward 4 hours laters, me and my girlfriend finally got to order lol.</text>< pictures>

<rating>4</rating><text>Santa Barbara Chicken Ranch was a surprise treat for myself and my partner after receiving a $50 grub hub gift card from my employer.  Granted, I hated to have had to use Grub Hub because I know they charge the restaurant fees but this was a chance for me to try the restaurant and perhaps be a return customer.  The service was quick and rushed.  Unknown to me exactly the culture of the ordering system prevented me from fully enjoying my meal as apparently they normally have a salsa bar to accompany your meal (they provided tortillas and it was expected to make your food into a taco) but because the bar is shut down I had no idea there was something else missing from my meal that would have drawn the taste out more.  The 1/2 chicken was all white meat and was amazing though I would have expected a half of chicken to be 1 thigh, 1 breat, 1 wing, 1 leg and I did not see that option.  Great price!<//text>< pictures>

A good  place if you like salsa.  They have two types of salsa: One type is a roasted salsa, and the other one is a choppy salsa.  The tri-tip plate is good,  but I will recommend any of the burritos.< /text>

Got the combo burrito, and it was pretty good. Size was nice, the flavor wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything above average. For $10 the amount of food you get makes it worth it</Text>

It’s ok, but not great.  Don’t come here expecting classic BBQ.  My first time here I got the tri tip plate.  Without the salsa, it was dry and lacking flavor.  The second time I got the chicken plate, which was better but nothing extraordinary.  I can’t say the quality is bad, but maybe my palate is more adventurous than what this place has to offer.  But in a pinch and if I’m in the area, I’ll come back.<//Text>

Great food, but in small portions. Be prepared for high wine and menu prices. We didn't enjoy the ambience as much as many other fine dining restaurants. Seemed pretentious and stuffy rather than easygoing and fun.< /text>

Rarely if ever will I give a place a five star review but this place deserves it due to it's tasty and customizable menu options, simple layout and consistent quality. I've been going there for at least 5 years now every time I visit the SB area and I always make it a point to get food here< /Text>

<text>Clean, courteous, and delicious! You can't go wrong with this Santa Barbara establishment. Their grilled chicken plate, whatever size you get, is sure to please and their tri tip is almost as good. Your food comes out to you in less time than it takes to order and receive something from the taco bell across the way, and it's a trillion, billion times more healthy!

I don't even know why I compared it to a fast food restaurant... Go here, get the chicken, use the spicy Asada Salsa, and leave full and happy. These guys deserve your business.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80e940636c444b4d:0x7c867f367a21fa71<//gmapID></record>

Not good at all. More so a mexican bbq spot that is not good. Tri tip was dry, and sides were boring and basic. More so a typical 2 star joint at a pull over exit.</text>

Very good chicken and tri-tip in Goleta CA.  Stopped in her on a Sunday afternoon because my friend wanted tri-tip. I wanted both so I got the combo platter.  The tri-tip is very good. However, it was the chicken that got my attention. Marinated in the style of El Pollo Loco but cooked better!  Recommended!<//Text>

DISAPPOINTING!  Food was bland! The tri-tip was beyond salty.  The chicken was just okay.  If a friend had recommended this place, then I would never take their food advice ever again! Very bummed!< /text>

After searching for a nail salon for over a year since I moved to Fremont. They are very skilled and super patient. & certainly did understand and did it precise. So even after 2. 5 weeks of nail growth, the growth is not too noticeable. Will definitely be back next week for a refill on my full set. I absolutely love the end result.</Text>

I made my appointment a couple days ago and arrived 10 minutes late, but Theresa's Hair & Nails Fremont acted really professionally. They were all friendly and very professional and did a fabulous job! I would totally come back here to do my nails~<//review>

I ran in during lunch to get my old nails removed. Best service, best nails, and the nicest Staff ever. They were very nice and kind. Sometimes, they asked until I said ok! Will definitely be back next week for a refill on my full set. I absolutely love the end result.</review>

A team of dedicated, thoughtful, meticulous consulting and service staff, beautifying my nails without having to worry about scratching or bleeding, this is also a plus point to help the shop keep the customer come back again.<//Review>

They are a bit casual, but price, service and flexibility of them working around my time is unbeatable.  They could use a better nail design expert and maybe a bit more message on Pedi.  However the application of nailcolor is long lasting and I don't even use gloves to do dishes.</review>

<Review>After searching for a nail salon for over a year since I moved to Fremont. They are very skilled and super patient. & certainly did understand and did it precise. So even after 2. 5 weeks of nail growth, the growth is not too noticeable. Will definitely be back next week for a refill on my full set. I absolutely love the end result.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I made my appointment a couple days ago and arrived 10 minutes late, but Theresa's Hair & Nails Fremont acted really professionally. They were all friendly and very professional and did a fabulous job! I would totally come back here to do my nails~</text>

They just need to be better staffed for better service. They forgot to check on our meals and we waited for like 30 minutes til they noticed. Luckily we had an appetizer already. The food was on point. I would love to try more! They have private parking. And they have a nice outdoor patio with heaters. For luncheons and small events the have a 30 people capacity back room. Will be back!<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMOSluRreqPR2E_n4y_i-3m-xb6E04y26LXeo8E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVn6Bod10CVqazXBauSQ5DcstJDKrzy6xL-LOM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Resp>

<Text>My cousin and I picked this restaurant for my birthday dinner their specialty is Ecuadorian cuisine which I’ve never had before so I was very looking forward to experiencing this. Lots of seafood a lot of tropical flavors outdoor seating was very sweet the drinks were strong which is a plus for your birthday celebration service and definitely the food prices are very fair it’s a great place for a dinner date or hang out with family</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN1TFFKx1B2Ay6i-1A2ZlvYreEEpyv4xuUqxaY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

First time at this restaurant. Extremely poor experience. They include a 18% tip even if you have a party of 2. This is not typical unless it's a party of 7/8 or More. On top of that, they include a service fee as well. And that's not all. The restaurant is situated on a residential area so there is no where to park, they have their restaurant parking. We parked. We left and we were blocked in by a car and we're charging us 10$ to leave. Nowhere does it state that you have to pay for parking, there's nothing that states that it's 10$ for parking. You would think they would put a sign there so people are aware that they have to pay if they park there. Ridiculous. Just put a sign so that people are aware they need to pay to park.<//review>

The dishes are packed with familiar ingredients like coconut, lemongrass, basil, and coriander. Taking its cues from the culinary culture from down under, this restaurant is all of the straightforward gratification and excellent food every single time.<//review>

<Review>What can i say this place freaking D E L I C I O U S! My wife is Colombian and this place brings a fusion all of South American. Happy Wife, Happy Life! Great Quality food! Great Drink selection. We ordered the churrasco and the pasta diabolo (jumbo shrimp with a spicy tomato sauce) During covid times bring a cell to scan for menu! Our waitress Sofi was soo sweet and patient! We'll be back for sure! Worth the drive we took from South Bay to Silverlake.<//Review>< time>

Food was delicious & the vibe was awesome! Can't wait to go back! The Lomo Saltado was second to none! I loved the fresh twist on this classic Peruvian dish! The grilled Avocado was also delicious but the portion size was a little smaller than expected. Otherwise, delicious and wonderful.<//review>

First and last time eating here. Tasteless food for the price. No Ecuadorian taste at all.

Restaurants in Miami are closer to Ecuadorian real taste.
Very dissatisfied< /review>

This is by far the best Ecuadorian/Italian restaurant in LA, food is well cooked and portions are enough to satisfy anyone, very professional
Elizabeth our waitress, time of service outstanding, 5 starts well deserved
I’ll definitely come back whenever I’m back in town 😋<//Text>

The soup with green plantains was good, but the jugo de mora and jugo de naranjilla was super delicious.  My family and I enjoy coming here. The waiter is very nice and quick to serve.  😊< /Text>

I got the Lomo Saltado, and it was incredible. My fiancé had Llapingachos Con Fritada, which was also delicious! The whole menu looks amazing, We ordered for takeout, and the food was super fresh and prompt. In more normal times, we're looking forward to going back and enjoying the beautiful patio.< /review>

An eclectic mix of South American and Italian food. A great place to try something exotic and new, or just stick with the tried and true. Excellent variety of drinks from South America. Service can be slow. A bit expensive. Outdoor patio is really cool, though right next to 101 freeway.</Text>

< Review>
The resturant is beautiful with a charming patio too.

The food is excellent.   I jad the fanesca which is a typical Ecuadorian dish served only during lent.   It was as delicious as I ever had  in Ecuador.

They have a large menu which also includes a lengthy list if Italian dishes and Peruvian dishes too.

The service was great.  The owner very nice and friendly.

I am definately coming back here.<//Review>

The food was a total disaster. Out of our table, fritada was greasy, the saltado de lomo was dry as a rock and the potatoes greasy.  Meat empanadas mediocre.  Very slow service.  Dissapointed and I do not know where they get their 5 star review.<//Review>

I came to have lunch with my family that came from out of town. We came to have lunch, and the wait was more than normal. As the place was empty, yes we did have a large party but the service was horrible.

We all got out food at different times, hardly any refills on our drinks. We actually had to go to the bar and ask for our drinks. To be transparent, she appears to be the only waitress on the floor. I can understand how hard that can be, yet it’s still not a good experience. Especially when I’m getting charged 18% gratuity and then an extra $5 service fee for using my debit card.

I don’t think I will be coming back.< /Review>

I've been coming to this place for years. It's a piece of Ecuador in Silver Lake. We enjoyed two staple cuisine dishes; llapingachos con fritada and fanezca. Although the food is delicious and of great quality they can improve on bringing out the dishes sooner.< /Text>

I don't know how many years I've been  sporadically driving by this restaurant. Well tonight we gave it a try. I had grilled chic breast, fresh veggies and rice. My date had lamb stew with rice and plantains. Full bar, really hip jazzy tunes playing.  It ended up being an Ecuadorian restaurant. Decent stop, would try for lunch/brunch next time.< /Review>

So far I've enjoyed pretty much everything I've tried on their menu which is not something you see in your average Hispanic / pasta restaurants they offer unique flavor and for those who like to step out the box a bit this is definitely for you.. their drinks are well-to-do (no pun intended) and their service is impeccable exhibiting such class and caring out our requests throughout our experience.. I've recommended El Caserio to a number of people prior to this review.. I'd give them 10 Stars if I could..< /Text>

Ecuadorian food is Los Angeles is hard to come by. This restaurant is one of the few suggested by the Ecuadorian Consulate. Fairly expensive, but worth the price.</Review>

<text>Pretty good dishes, service definitely is a 5 star and the plate is good for an individual meal. Love the theme of the place and the music they play cause it gives you a Spanish kind of vibe while you're enjoying your meal with family and friends. The bar is really good different type of drinks and brands they have for you. Parking lot is kind of small but the  restaurant has a fair space, It has a patio so you can enjoy a lovely dinner outside. Wheelchair accessible entrance.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>• The food is absolutely delicious.
• We went on Wednesday, 16oct2019 at a slow hour (only 3 couples there)
• The service was lousy. At the beginning it was fairly quick but once I asked for the check we waited over ten minutes for it to come; then we waited and waited for the waitress to come and pick up the check. I finally had to get up and go look for the waitress in order to pay the bill. Easily some 30 minutes or more waiting for the check and to pay the bill.</Review>< pics>

The food is good although a bit pricey. Plus they skimp out some food items (like only 4 or 5 pieces of shrimp and too much sauce and rice). If you come early, there is plenty of parking but come closer to dinner time and you will have to use their valet service or park in the street.<//text>

<Review>I had always liked this place. The food is good but little by little they have been removing perks and portions get smaller and smaller every time, plates used to be larger and included salad and or avocado slices, recently, they removed the bread which was really good btw.  But the most irritating item is having an 18% tip added to your bill no matter how small your party is. Beware! They do not tell you this upfront and they do not tell you if you add additional tip either. I’d not mind an 18% tip if the service was at least above average, but the service simply is very mediocre. Also, like a cheap Latino restaurant, they add a service charge if you pay with credit card. Who does that these days? We all pay with credit cards now days.  It’s the 21st century and we are not back in our home country. I’d rather pay more for a meal than be gouged and penny pinched for every little item. Watch, next they are going to charge 5 pesos to use the restroom, lol.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Food was delicious. Ambience comfortable. The service was kind and slow. I believe because of understaffing. I made a reservation for 10. There was another party of 12. I don't think they were staffed accordingly.</Text>

Great food and amazing service. The only down side is the price has gone up in recent years from their old location, so I don't get to go eat there as often as I would like. Food is still good if your looking for a nice place to eat.< /Text>

I waited for over an hour and ended up taking it to go because everyone else had already finished their meals. The waitress blamed it on the cook. To make matters worse they charged me for the food I didn’t get to eat. All they took off was $10 off my entire bill that was over $100. Bad experience, bad customer service, food wasn’t that great either. I don’t recommend this place at all!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Lengua plate was delicious.
But the service sucked. Maybe it was just a bad day for them being understaffed.
Eventhough the food was delicious I honestly don't know if I would go back.<//review>

Please do not order cazuela. It had cheese and the  consistency  was too liquid. It costs 25$ and it was just a waste of money. What a disappointment!! I am
Never returning. Slow service .This review is coming from a 100% Ecuadorian.<//text>

Great food and service. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that they charge 4% on top of your bill if you pay by credit card, this is an absolutely no, no, for me to come back. Owner shouldn't pass this fee to his customers  this is part of you doing business.  Now days nobody carries cash, so we were not prepared for this.  They told me but we explained it before we charged it. Yes you explained it, but I don't have $500 in cash with me, so I had no choice.< /text>

First time going there.  We had reservations and waited approximately 30mins to be seated.  Food was good but service left much to be desired.  We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 of which arrived prior to the meal.  The 3 arrived shortly after our meal.  The waitress never came by to ask during our meal if there was anything else.  We only saw her for our order and the check.  We had to ask someone else for water.  With the prices I would figure that when they wrap their silverware, they would know the difference between a salad fork and a dinner fork.  Also, check your glasses cause nothing is more disgusting than seeing lip prints on a glass that you have not taken a drink from as of yet.</Text>

Excellent Lomo Saltado, fresh and tasty meat. The Lentil Soup is very delicious. Their Sea Food ceviche is one of their best plates. Unfortunately, the quality of the service will depend on who's working that night.</Review>

Came here during brunch and the place was lovely.  I had the pescado a la parrilla and it was delicious. The servers were very friendly and would check on us frequently if we needed anything. Their mango margarita was perfect, not to sweet and the amount of liquor was perfectly balanced. The prices were pretty average throughout the whole menu so can't really complain. I would definitely be coming here again.</Text>

<response>None<//response><review>I have and would recommend El Caserio to all my friends.  It's a beautiful restaurant with a great patio and amazing Ecuadorian fine cuisine.

I was looking for something new and unique and El Caserio was it.  They serve authentic Ecuadorian cuisine which I had never had before.  It's amazing fresh light seafood dishes, perfectly cooked pork tenderloin placed on a delicious fluffy potato patty.

The decor of the patio makes you feel like you're nestled away, which is hard to imagine being right off the freeway.  It was a great dining experience.  The waitress was friendly and attentive and the drinks were amazing.  I recommend their passion fruit frozen cocktail or their delicious lattes and coffee.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Food is always great, place clean as expected, but the service has gone down.
Had to wait a long time for the food, and the order for the adults came before the kids considering that it was pasta with sauce only.
I want to believe it is understaffed and not that they are cutting on waitresses/waiters.< /review>

Our family had a great time here.  Every thing was made from scratch, the empanadas were awesome!Drinks were on the expensive side, $4 for iced tea is a little steep, next time waters all around but we’ll be back for great scenery/patio and authentic Ecuadorian food.</Text>

Really bad experience tonight, they are pricy and do not have all that is on the menu, be careful with your money!! They charge you 20 percent extra of your entire bill if you go after 5pm!! Also if you pay like almost every regular costumer with a debit card, they charge you 3.5 percent of your entire bill ....they do not mention they are including tips, if you do not check your bill, expect to pay a lot. The server was ok, the problem is she brought a miserable supervisor or bad server worker, who try to scream in our table that they charge everything extra, a no respectful and miss educated lady!! Food is ok but not near to what Ecuadorian food really is.< /text>

My boyfriend went here like six years ago. He said good food back then. Dont know he says might be under new management, but you know when a restaurant puts love into the food, how its prepared and of course the taste. Oh Lord! Very disappointed. I ordered fish plate he ordered steak plate. The fish was undercooked no flavor except for what he sprinkled on top. His steak was so thin had layers of bell pepper onion and an egg underneath. No love in preparing the food. We will never go back. We didn't pay for my plate only his. Food not worth the price!< /text>

We were visiting Los Angeles and browsed for Latin   American restaurants and found El Caserio, we  loved this restaurant. Food was excellent  , the best white rice ever and service was good. Expensive? ? No, comparing with other restaurants in Los Angeles with much less quality food. We really enjoyed it!!<//Review>

<Review>a hidden gem of central American and Italian cuisine.

there table side "aji" is worth the trip alone

almost a tomato fresca that you would find on bruschetta but with an added central American twist AND serious heat.

wonderful restaurant</Review>< gmapID>

<review>The food is excellent but the service is really poor, the owner should take consideration on this matter. I have been coming to this restaurant for more than 20 years, my children grew up coming here... but sadly we will have to find another place. The waitress only comes to get your order, brings your food and doesn't return to refill the drinks or to check if you need something else… they look understaff and this might be reason why they don't give you the proper service. The owner was there the last time we went and she forgets that people have so many other choices specially when you are in LA.  I noticed the employees had a new shirt that said "I see you but I am just ignoring you" something like that. Sorry for the long review but I feel I have to be real</review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Service is A+, basically a very nice date or family dinner place.  They do have a bar for any single diners too!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>Double check your bill. We where charged 40 dollars tip plus 8 dollars for (service charge) using debit card payment option it's a ripe off.. Tips are optional based on the service and to the clients criteria not the restaurant..  besides we only saw the waiter 4 times out of the 2 hour dinning no refills where offered waiter took 38 min to bring the bill... not worth it there are better peruvian and ecuadorean food places with
reasonable pricing.. and without mandatting to pay their dessire tip.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Food was not good. They substitute the meat in one of the dishes. Besides that, 4 hours later we all got sick. Seems that food was frozen.

<Text>Great ambiance. The calamari was mediocre.  The churrasco had no chimichuri...pretty dry and somewhat chewy. The Lomo salteado was very good. .bit salty.  I'm not sure if I would come back.  I don't think it was worth the value of a hundred bucks for two people.  I've had better meat at Grand Central Market.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< time>

<review>The food was good but not fulfilling. I got the Sin Carne Plate and it was satisfying but I felt it was missing tang. The empanadas were good and also the yucca frita. The Caldo de Rez was salty, lacked flavor, and the elements did not quite mesh well together.<//review><gmap_id>0x80c2c76a47849451:0xe514b205ea3d3a6b<//gmap_id><rating>3< /rating><Response>None< /Response><Time>1431056196344< /Time>< user_id>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Came here on my first date with my now Boyfriend. He's from Ecuador so he wanted me to have a taste of their food. Well the place is very nice. We got a seat at the outside patio. The freeway is right next to the restaurant so you can hear all the traffic. The décor outside is not nice. There is too much of a lot of things going on. Like hanging hearts and Iguanas on the wall. I think they should stick to one theme. The food was very good. We had Seco de pollo and Seco de camarones (I think). The empanadas where tasty but not awesome. They do have Valet parking so bring cash. Also 2 times they kept bringing us food and drinks that weren't ours. I think they need to be better at service.< /Review>< Pictures>

I ordered a churrasco and all I got was rice egg and the steak. 10 mins later I got fries that were supposed to be in my plate. Even worse he said that the kitchen is really busy and he has a lot of tables inside. I've worked as a server before and that doesn't matter to the customer. In the menu it says orange is free refill. Well it wasn't free. The servers never cared for our table. Que pena. And it sucks because the other tables had food served really nice unlike ours. Not coming back.<//Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Terrible service and extremely salty food. Due to the service, the waitresses do not care about their clients or the treatment they give them, throwing the cutlery on the table and without noticing older people. As far as food is concerned, their dishes were extremely salty regarding the seafood rice (the rice was watered down, and the fish damaged, like clams and mariacos), the seco de chivo (the meat was extremely salty, the rice in terrible shape) the green soup (the extremely sweet ball of green stuffed with peanuts, it's supposed to be a soup, and I end up being the opposite) and their chaulafan (it's really salty). And not to mention that there were flies on the plates of food that were about to be served to their guests. I do not recommend this place.

(Original)
Pésimo servicio y comida sumamente salada. Debido a el servicio las meseras no se preocupan por su cliente o trato que le dan, arrogando los cubiertos en la mesa y sin percatarse de personas mayores. En lo que a comida respecta sus platos fueron sumamente salados en respecto al arroz marinero ( el arroz estaba aguado, y el.pescado dañado, al.igual que las almejas y mariacos) , el seco de chivo ( sumamente salada la carne, el arroz en pésimo estado) la sopa de verde ( la bola de verde sumamente dulce rellena de maní, se supone que es una sopa, y termino siendo lo contrario) y su chaulafan ( es realmente salado). Y por no.comentsr que había moscas en los platos de comida  que estaban por servir a sus comensales. No recomiendo este lugar.<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Every time you look worse this restaurant if you pay with a card, they charge you separately, it includes the tips 20% when the waitress only came once and then got lost and did not come back and do not stop me just to include the tip when they do not attend you well .... from there an old nose if I would be a supervisor comes up to tell me that it is obligatory to tip that for being the first time they forgive me but for paying with a card they will charge me 3 or 5% of insurance I wanted cash to not report to the taxes the old that ....... GIVE THE TIP ACCORDING TO THE ATTENTION otherwise be removed from the bill because it is not mandatory to give ....... or that they are going to put in jail or that ... ... silk according to what they attend to you

<review>(Translated by Google) El Caserío Restaurant has lowered the quality of its food a lot, what we ordered with my family typical dishes from Ecuador and we had to return 2 dishes because the chicken had been stored in the freezer for a long time and the soup we ordered was strained and not soup. .. very sad for what has happened with El Caserío Restaurant.

<text>(Translated by Google) I went to this restaurant to try the traditional fanesca and what they served me was frijolada con peanut
They didn't even pack the fried plantains and the traditional flour balls.
The prices they charge you do not justify the food they serve you !!!
I do not recommend at all !!!

(Translated by Google) The service is very good but the food lacks the proper Ecuadorian style. Imagine that a plate of encebollado tastes like yuca soup.

(Original)
La atención es muy buena pero la comida carece del estilo propiamente Ecuatoriano imagínese que un plato de encebollado  sabe a sopa de yuca.</review>
