I had all 4 of my wisdom teeth out, half were impacted. I did it fully awake and the surgeon was super cool and was easy to talk to, I actually had a little fun just talking to everyone and learning about the process. Told me everything I needed to know and got straight to business. Being awake during the procedure isn't as bad as it sounds and the surgeon was very good about giving me a local anesthetic anytime I needed it. I healed fully in a short time and I highly recommend anyone who is getting their wisdom teeth out awake go here!< /text>

I made an appointment, showed up, didn't have the paper referral with me. I'm a cash patient. Secretary was being pretty rude about it. My teeth super hurt. I said ok I'll figure it out and come back. Got my referral, called back to make an appointment and they refused me service. Pretty sure it was the same rude lady. First lady I scheduled appointment with was great. Unfortunately never talked with her again. Major thumbs down.</Review>< Pictures>

I was a bonded by their front office staff person Andrea who laughed at me because of my distress and said anyone who comes in will have to wait at least 1 and a half hours due to their overbooking policy. They are unrepentant and are very sadistic in their approach that anyone who complains of their terrible customer service. I’ve had to speak with the California dental oversight board about their poor customer service. What a shameful way to treat their recurring customers. The truth about this business needs to be stated.

<review>Amazing dental treatment and repair. The customer service is awesome. I have never felt more comfortable and excited for the finished results on my teeth and health in general until, I experienced Town and Country Dental. They take very good care of their patients. I wish my brother would have told me about them sooner...< /review></record>

And they never flexible around your work schedule I would work in the mornings so that meant I couldn’t have an appointment in the morning and the ladies at the front desk literally told we only have AM options so pick one!!!

<review>Best  family dental office in Indio. They were very good at explaining every step of  my treatment. I was very anxious but their positive attitudes  made me feel very comfortable. Dr Corral is great  at making the dental experience  a fun one.
The pediatric dentist who saw my daughter was very interested in her well being. She gave me great advise and educated me on things I didn't know I was supposed to do with my daughter's teeth.
They also do braces and have an oral surgeon which I am scheduled to see soon.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This is probably the worst place I've ever been to and I've been in a lot of offices not only do the staff look like they're being tortured just being there with those long faces it also seems like they could care less I've been inside there about five times not only did they schedule me to go in on a day that they weren't even open they rescheduled me a couple of days before the 4th of July and then they ended up calling me to reschedule once again because apparently the dentist decided to go celebrate Fourth of July somewhere else so then we reschedule for the third time and I learned that they don't give you a courtesy call nor a reminder Sans they gave it to me three weeks later I had forgotten all about it they never call you to check up the never call you to remind you or anyting and now I'm still in need of a dentist due to the fact that they couldn't do their job</text>

<Review>Ridiculous wait time I had an appointment at 9 went in at 10:30 waited 30 min inside for the dentist to come in for a less than a minute to tell me I’m healinh properly.

To be fair...never met the dentist. I was told we were scheduled for the oral surgery consultation and we were not. They did not have the proper thyroid collar protection for the x-rays and the location had several pieces of the floor missing. It seemed dirty and there were several spots on the floor with mold in the seams. When they told me the oral surgery would be done in that office...I was out. We drove a long way and were not even scheduled for the right appointment. I was not coming back, so we left.<//Text>

I'm a patient at Town & Country Dental in Indio. I just previously got my braces and they do not hurt and it's only been 3 days. I was very nervous that they would hurt but Town & Country Dental took a good job of putting them on right. They have a very friendly and nice staff that reassures me every time I walked in the door. They have a bright smile when you walk in the door and welcome you.</text>

The woman on the phone had horrible customer service. They don't even call to confirm appointments. The women there are rude about many small details. We made an appointment 1 month in advance just to show up and be turned away b/c they didn't have their office together. Awful experience more than a few times and would never recommend them.<//text>

When i first came to this facility i thought how the services would be, im very picky, i had a top end dentist  before town and country, but after my third visit its professional, no wait time and they have a specialist who clean my teeth, it is a good run business, i already had my wife swith dentist.< /Text>

I am a mother of Two Patients here at Town and Country Dental.
My son went through a little over 2 yrs. of starting & finishing orthodontics at this office.
His experience was great. Staff was helpful & comforting during his treatment.
Now his braces are off and we are so pleased.

Now my daughter is starting her treatment of braces. She was very concerned, but rest assured after her first visit.
We've seen both the Dentist and the Orthodontist here. I've been very satisfied.
I have more to say about the Orthodontist only because we saw much more of him. He is very thorough and made us feel comfortable with each visit. He took just the right amount of time with each and every one of his patients that I observed, showing he IS dedicated.

The receptionists in the front behind the desk, are Always pleasant and have a smile to welcome you.
The ladies are ready to set up your next appointment when your finished and ready to leave.

Paulina (receptionist) is such an asset. She seems to love her position here and has such positive energy each and Everytime we've come in. I Really appreciate That and her.

I am grateful for our experience so far and will continue to come here.
I'm a retired orthodontic assistant myself, so I know What to look for and What stands out as far as OSHA Requirements. I've never been disappointed in what I've observed here.

The General Dentist is So happy, he also brings such a Positive, Delightful Joy in saying hello, genuinely asking how you are, caring about you as the patient and as an individual. I'm considering redoing my cosmetic veneers. I was surprised in the time & attention he gave me during my consultation. That says and shows alot about him and his connection with his patients.
Our family is very pleased with Town and Country Dental and will highly recommend them.
Yes, you'll have a wait, but that's to be expected When The Dentists/Orthodontist are Great. So get over it and say to yourself : "This Is My Time to catch up on a good book, or resond to emails".

Receptionist are VERY RUDE.  They put you on hold  for a long time and then they hang up on you,  specially if it's getting close to their lunchtime.
If they switch receptionist and some staff this place would be really good to go to.< /Text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Tremendously cool to visit. Lots of bay area history in an exquisite period mansion. Our tour lasted around 2 and a half hours long and we could have easily listed to our expert guide talk for hours more. Absolutely worth trying for the lottery to get a tour - you won't find anything else like this in the Bay Area.<//text></record>

Fun and informative tour; I learned so much from architect/tour guide Allen about how to incorporate French design elements into home decor using soft lighting, earth toned colors, balance, symmetry. What a treasure that has been preserved for many yesterday to come.<//Review>

In college, I drove Countess Tolstoy from her “home” at the Fairmont Hotel down to Chateau Carolands then owned by Countess Lillian Dandini. Lillian was a gracious hostess and lovely lady. Took many photos of my My 54 Cadillac Limo in front of the Chateau...and my 85 Eldorado Biarritz Convertible recently..great memories indeed.</Text>

Restoration does not get any better,watched the most beautiful historic home renovation, feels wonderful to know it has been kept, the owner is to be commended to her purchase and joy of decorations and giving life back to this house and that some very wealthy people can do good for foundation to preserve and protect the house for arts and historical society to save it, thank you to The Johnson's, and I live just 20 miles south!!< /review>

The interiors of this Chateau is done tastefully. It has an interesting history. The tours are free, but the waitlist is long.</Text>

< Review>
Just watched the PBS special tonight about this historic place. Very interesting to hear of the beginnings and down through the years events of this estate. This huge estate reminds me of one I visited in Asheville, NC called the Biltmore Estate. Love to hear about and visit elaborate architectural mansions such as this one.< /Review>

Well presented by Tom.   An interesting and fun experience.   The only downside is you can't see the bedrooms due to fire code restrictions.< /review>

Love to see elderly people in the kitchen working together making delicious Dumplings. It reminded me of my mom in the kitchen making them with my sisters.</Review>

Craving for the most delicious dumpling in the Bay Area? This is the right place to go have it. We have been visiting this place for almost 4 years and we never get tired of coming here even though we have to commute for about 40 minutes. You will leave this place with that tasty flavor in your mouth. Service is  awesome!. It's a family style little cozy restaurant and I really love that the waitress recognizes us every time we go there which means, they take customers seriously! I love their tea, it's yummy and generous!
I would give this restaurant 10 stars if I could!!! Strongly recommend!< /Review>

<review>We ordered food via door dash, and will say the dumplings are pretty darn good! The xiao long bao and steamed dumplings were really tasty. The chow mein did not come with hand pulled noodles, but it wasn't bad. We also ordered a scrambled egg shrimp dish which was okay, and the mongolian beef had a kick to it. The quality of the beef wasn't very good though. Would recommend for the dumplings!< /review>< Pics>

King of Dumpling what can I say . Very delish beef noodle soup. As always cant wait to come back! Good soup for the soul, can always count on a bowl of this rich broth and hand made noodle soup. Simply Comfort..<//text>

The food is not bad and of relative good value. However, the service and venue are in need of improvement. I later switched from dining in to purchasing frozen dumplings but they really irked me when they decided to no longer accept credit card and wanted to charge 10 cents for single-use plastic bags, which are not compliant with the Reusable Bag Law for Alameda County.</Review>

<Review>Dumplings and noodles are freshly made here. You can taste the difference. I highly recommend their steamed dumplings and the pan fried ones. Their xiao long boa is pretty good, but I prefer ones with a bit more soup in the filling. They can get busy there and usually only one wait staff though.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Seating is average, service very friendly, portions are huge and best to share family style. Dumplings are good, not Din tai fung quality, but them again a fraction of the price.

<gmapID>0x808fbf4e2b7464e7:0xcff69085eac00ec0< /gmapID><review>Came in a group of 6 around 12:35PM on a Saturday.

Average prices for standard pork and cabbage dumplings are $7.55, definitely slight raise in prices since my previous visit.

Ordered their soup dumplings, pot stickers, 3 flavor (pork, shrimp, chives) dumpling, regular pork and cabbage dumplings, popcorn chicken, 3 flavor fried rice, pig ears, and walnut shrimp.

Order your appetizers early, we got the pig ears at the very end. Also note that the pig ears are the sliced string-ish form, not the thin wide slices. Also did not come with standard garlic and ginger sauce.

Overall, dumplings here are bomb. Their sambal has a great kick and works great with any dumpling. Eat the pot stickers early or they'll steam up and become soupy inside.< /review>< userid>

< review>
I love coming here for a multitude of reasons. I think dumplings are probably the best foods to eat, I could probably eat them forever and King of Dumplings always satisfies my cravings. What puts them apart from House of Dumplings in nearby Union City is that they have a greater selection of Hand-Pulled noodle dishes. Their dumplings are comparable to each other, and even comparable with Kingdom of Dumplings in SF, another popular spot. I highly recommend the Pork and Napa Dumplings, Chicken and Corn Dumplings, or Lamb and Vegetable Dumplings. If you are looking for noodles then I suggest the Dumpling Noodle because it comes with 6 pieces of your choice of dumpling. The prices are very fair as well, which is what makes this restaurant my go-to...cheap, delicious, consistent, no wait..absolutely perfect.</review>

As to the food, it's authentic, and taste delicious. The price is around $8.5 per serving, compared to Tong's Dumpling at cupertino village, which costs usually $11-$12 per serving, the food quality is on par.< /Text>

Their dumplings are pretty decent and the filings inside are well-made. However, other items are just sub par. I tried beef noodle and xiao long bao and they are disappointing. Service is just ok and I have to grab menu by myself and ask them to come to take my order but it might be because they were quite busy when I visited.< /review>

<time>1613980633125</time><review>(Translated by Google) The best dumpling shop in the Bay Area. And I really didn't expect it to be in 2021, there is such a cheap and delicious place, the food portion is also very sufficient. Frozen dumplings can be bought for 25 for nine yuan. It really feels like traveling back to ten years ago.

湾区最好吃的饺子店。而且真的没想到都2021年了，还有这么便宜好吃的地方，食物的分量也特别足。冷冻水饺九块钱能买到二十五个，真的感觉像是穿越回十几年前一样。</review></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) To tell you the truth, either the dishes or the dumplings are not good enough to be called King, even worse than the common! I have tried three times, the next one is always worse than the last one, I won't try again . Normally I don't write reviews, but this one really disappointed me a lot! To be honest, neither the dishes nor the dumplings are good enough to be called a king, even worse than ordinary ones. I have eaten three times, It’s getting worse every time and I won’t try again. Usually I don’t write reviews, but this shop really disappointed me!

I have tried three times, the next one is always worse than the last one, I won’t try again. Normally I don’t write reviews, but this one really disappointed me a lot! 说实话，不论是菜还是饺子都没有好到可以被叫做国王，甚至比普通的还差.我已经吃过三回了，一次比一次差，不会再尝试了，通常我是不写评论的，但这家店真的太让我失望了！< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The restaurant with the taste of northerners in China, the noodles are good, and there should not be many guests from Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao. The scallion pancakes used to be good, but now you don’t make them?

中國北方人口味的飯店，麵食還好，粵港澳地方的客人應該不會多。以前做的葱油餅不錯，現在居然不做了？< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The dumplings are ordinary, the noodles are full of soup, but the noodles are thrown away. Very salty. Because I didn’t eat beef, I ordered the noodles without beef. It was full of beef flavor.

One of the best breweries in Fresno. Small batch, not mass marketed beer. Quality over quantity. Great vibe in the tap room. Always a great time.< /review>

<Review>They have the Starwberry Berliner for the folks who want a good sour beer. The wife loves it because it doesn't taste like "beer". So for you folks who are not a fan of beer, give this one a try.</Review>< Pics>

Beer is good, but mostly outdoor seating only. They did have a taco truck while I was there.< /review>

<text>This place is great, the bar tenders were friendly and helpful. The brewery has some seating at the bar and a few tables but it's pretty small inside. This place has a great selection of craft beer and tonight they had a vegan food truck - Evolution Burger that was absolutely delicious! I definitely recommend both, the brewery and the food truck!!< /text>< UserId.>

First let me say that P&P brews the best beer by far in Fresno. Really. But if you go, take a measuring cup, to make sure you get what you paid for. For his chosen customers he will use oversized glasses and fill them to the rim, for others he will use undersized glasses, leave half an inch of space at the top, and then lay in an excessive head of foam. Regular customers have asked why he illegally cheats some customers and gives extras to other customers, and his response is typically to tell all of them  "I don't need you, if you don't like it just leave."
The beer is great, but the owner has some questionable business practices, has a strange concept of customer service, and has little respect for his clients.
Maybe this attitude of his comes from being bankrolled by daddy and by 'working' as and when he pleases in daddy's insurance business.
Customers who feel they have been repeatedly cheated by him have talked about suing him, so maybe daddy will see fit to give him insurance to cover that eventuality.</review>

Bartender told us, "well you need me, I'll be outside smoking a cigarette," as he kindly poured himself his second glass of beer...  He had a dirty face, dirty fingernails. Yes, fingernails.
Bar is middle of business buildings.  Random spot.

And when we were wanted to leave, a drunk guy walks in, yelling who was working there, proceeded to go around the bar and then headed to the bathroom still yelling. It was awful.   I never felt so uncomfortable being at a bar.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x8094681bc197405b:0xfc8e81a99ac8dd9b</Gmap_id></record>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>Vegan!! :)) $6.75 Original with special frosting for $0.25, and can customize more or pick a popular set one. Staff are extremely nice on the phone and in person. Anyone paranoid of entering a store can order via Yelp, and call them when ready to pick up from the front door. It was tasty but we didn't have the best reaction from it. We are skeptical of its quality or maybe it's just us? My SO doesn't have a sensitive stomach though.

I really like that it is individually packaged. And that it's in paper box too.<//text>< pictures>

This is seriously the best cinnamon roll you’ll ever have. You can get a classic cinnamon roll to fulfill your nostalgic cravings or you can build your own cinnamon roll and create a crazy combination of all of all of your favorite sweets on top to your hearts desire. To top it off, they are all completely cruelty free, plant-based, and vegan, but you definitely don’t even have to be conscious about animal rights to enjoy these rolls!<//Text>

<review>My boyfriend and I love this place! Way better than Cinnabon and with a big variety in flavors and specialties. The staff is very nice when I come and the prices don’t break you for indulging in your guilty pleasure. The favorites are the classic cinnamon roll and the Echo Park!</review>< pics>

<text>I know it sounds crazy to rave about Cinnamon rolls, but this isn't your typical cinnamon roll! For starters, my entire order was vegan and for some reason that made it even more delicious! I love the options of customizing your own roll, and adding things like "special frosting". Great if you are looking to give yourself a sweet treat! The parking can be a bit hectic in the small parking lot, but that's not Cinnaholics fault. Do yourself a favor and endulge! I usually get one to eat the next day as well...just love this place!<//text>< Rating>

< Review>
I ordered delivery, so I can't comment on Cinnaholic's customer service or atmosphere. As far as the cinnamon rolls go: I was skeptical that they'd be able to pull off piling a bunch of toppings on a cinnamon roll without it coming out sickningly sweet. Unfortunately, my skepticism was warranted. The dough was more or less taste free and under-done in the middle. The brownie chunks on the death-by-chocolate were stale, and none of the various chocolate toppings were particularly rich or chocolatey. With the cinnamon/chocolate combo, I was hoping for a flavor inspired by Mexican Hot Chocolate. I got simple syrup instead. The  Carmel Apple Pie flavor was slightly better. On one hand, the apple pieces and pecans cut the otherwise overwhelming sweetness a little, but the caramel frosting/caramel sauce combo was overkill, especially since neither flavor had any redeeming nuance.</Review>

This place is definitely delicious for vegan desserts. I was vegan a few years ago, so I think that I have a taste for it. My boyfriend though, he wasn’t having it. I didn’t tell him they were vegan, and being a non-vegan his whole life he thought something was off. This is my review though so I’m giving my honest opinion, just thought I’d add it for people who aren’t used to like non-dairy/vegan products. I would definitely order again and recommend. Prices aren’t bad and there are plenty of toppings for a wide variety of sweet tooths lol</text>

Have eaten here many times and all is well. Neighborhood cafe with good, healthy food and friendly staff. Patio eating is fun in good weather and prices are reasonable. Only drawback is parking which is generally in the city lot across the street. No matter...we will continue to eat here when the mood for a sandwich hits us.<//Text>

I dont know if I can put into words how delicious this was. Let me first say I spent 3 days preparing myself to get donuts and when i went Donut Farm was unexpectedly closed. I was HEARTBROKEN. I sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes going through the stages of grief. A quick search told me Cinnaholic was 1/2mile away.

I'd never been or even heard of it and now it's my favorite place on earth. As a first time they helped me choose the cookie monster and allowed me to sample the marshmallow icing first. When I said that might be too sweet for me they provided several recommendations before landing on swapping in the vanilla icing. Perfect advice!

Very helpful, so delicious, very clean and appealing space. And did I mention everything just happens to be vegan? I'm in love.< /review>< pictures>

I recently ordered custom cookies from this bake shop and they did an amazing job! The staff was super helpful and patient each time I called to ask about the different cookies they offered (this was for baby shower cookies that were used as favors), the cost, delivery schedule, etc. They even let me pick up the cookies a little early the day before my event. I would definitely go back to them for future events or just for a yummy treat!< /Review>

<Text>New! Easy parking is a huge win. Friendly staff and fresh tasting cinnamon rolls even at the end of the day are pros. Overwhelming # of choices though. The oversized servings, higher(ish) prices, and generally heavy nature of a sugar loaded cinnamon roll will keep me from becoming a regular. Most days I'd prefer fro-yo. *awesome* that their entire store is vegan! Good music at just the right volume is a nice finishing touch.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUt3QvR1yloDyFUJy4rW-wEjQfmnaHCZA28x-c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFYAr3t7UIaNol0Gqdk5rWszzQSf2fvqTbz0uH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c710a4194f8d:0x1d57c63d84656650</gmap_id></record>

Overwhelming # of choices though. The oversized servings, higher(ish) prices, and generally heavy nature of a sugar loaded cinnamon roll will keep me from becoming a regular. Most days I'd prefer fro-yo. *awesome* that their entire store is vegan! Good music at just the right volume is a nice finishing touch.</Review>< pics>

<review>I tried this for my first time through GrubHub, and I was so pleasantly surprised by my Cinnaholic experience! I have severe food allergies to peanuts and tree nuts, and I was comfortable ordering from here because their products are nut free, with the exception of some nut toppings. I typically can never have cinnamon rolls that aren't home made because nuts are commonly used as a topping or in the cinnamon mix. I ordered a plain cinnamon roll with vanilla frosting, chocolate chips, and brownie bites, and it was absolutely delicious! Since it was dairy free, I didn't need to refrigerate it overnight, and it held up for at least 2-3 days. I also tried the cookie dough, which was also delicious. I'm hoping to order it with my colleagues again soon.</review>< Pics>

<Review>walked in and the broad with the purple pony tail gave me attitude as if i ran over her dog. yelled to me asking if i was here to pick up, i said no. so she yells again and i say no. then says to my group (2 others and i) that there’s a menu outside we can look at. looking at the menu from outside of the place, she looks back at us and rolls her eyes. walk back in once i’m ready to order and she takes our order from across the kitchen or wherever they make the food. comes to the counter to charge me. and just as another party comes out they ask us if she was rude to us too. what a joke. turning away customers. gives cinnaholic a bad look and rep Lol. i have to give a thumbs down.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>Great vegan sweets! I was craving a Cinnabon but at the time I was vegan, 2 weeks off of a full body cleanse. When I found out about this place I was stoked. But boy, I had NO IDEA HOW GREAT IT REALLY WAS! Definitely recommend this to all vegans who indulge in junk treats from time to time. Guilt free decadence!< /review></record>

Disappointing. Food was okay. The actual bun was bland in an attempt to highlight the toppings, which may or may not compliment each other. It simply was not worth the price point and calories intake. If you want a cinnabun, the generic cinnabun store found at airports and malls is the way to go. I’d even prefer the pillsbury cinnabun version found at grocery stores for a third of the price.< /text>

Hot, fresh, vegan cinnamon buns, what's not to like ????  And non-vegans, don't write this place off because it's vegan.  You wouldn't know if you weren't told. These are real cinnamon buns, not some terrible, weird cardboard.  They also freeze well, so you can buy a bunch and eat them at your leisure. I always go old school, because that's my fave, but to each his own.  There is a little parking lot too, so you don't have to search for parking.</Text>

The Echo Park Store recently opened and true to it's name become my daily habit. The rolls are very tasty, the icings incredible and the people who work there are happy ! what more could you want.  Great addition to Echo Park, and it is nice to support a start-up company.<//review>

Good, but not great.   I ordered the cinnamon bun with minimal topping (powdered sugar) and the bun looked really pale.  I wanted to enjoy the bun, not the topping.</text>

I sooo wish one was closer to me. All their cinnamon buns are vegan, like wth it’s amazing delicious and worth the 30min drive. There’s a plethora of options to choose form, which make it hard for a foodie with a bad sweet tooth like me lol. But with with whatever you choose I feel you can’t go wrong!! The place is small, wish it was bigger for customers to be able to sit and enjoy our sweets inside, but there are a few table outside if you’re able to snag one. Overall great experience, friendly staff. I can’t wait to return</review>

The parking situation can be a bit confusing as the complex is currently under construction. That problem should be remedied soon as new businesses begin to open. We would love know which YouTuber your sister heard about us from so we can give them a proper "thank you"! We have numerous new Cinnaholic locations popping us and perhaps we will have one closer to your sister in the future.

This is one of those vegan places you don't need to think of as a vegan place, but just a delicious place (that happens to be vegan)!  My sister is vegan as was visiting from out of town and learned about this place from one of her favorite youtubers.

It has clear signage out front, but the free parking behind the building didn't have any signs, so that was a little confusing.  We were fine, so it's great that this has plenty of parking... I just wasn't 100% sure at the time if I was supposed to park there or not (pretty sure I was).  There are no tables inside, so that kind of stinks.  But there are a few tables outside, which we took advantage of.  There wasn't many people there so we were fine... but I do highly recommend this place get more tables.

Now for the food... you order a cinnamon bun and pick from a TON of frostings!  It was amazing how many flavors they had!  They'll let you sample them too.  Then you add your toppings and there you have it.  Everything is vegan, and tasted amazing (and I'm not a vegan).  So this is a really great place to take your vegan friends when they come in town and you want some dessert or a snack outing that's something a littler different than ice cream.</Text>

<text>Eeeee, this place is my home away from home♥️ My favorite place in all of Los Angeles. Eric is a rockstar behind the counter and the Cinnamon rolls have me hooked forever. I am truly a CINNAHOLIC. Be warned, if you eat here it'll be the best dessert you've ever had and you'll become addicted too. Protip: get the twix, ohmygod is it heavenly.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>I live out here on Fields Landing. The views from the dock do not get old for me.. It's a great place to have a picnic and to drop a crab pot off the dock or cast a line while the sun sets in front of you. Quite area with hardly any trouble. 2 docks to walk 50ft or so out onto the water alongside the boat launch. Beautiful place to spend the day with family or friends. Sun sets early in the winter here and can be chilly after the sun sets here.< /Review>< Pictures>

I like this launch a lot better than the one under the  Samoa bridge. It is closer to the  jettie's. And it has bathroom's that are open all the time. Let's hope that someone does not mess that up for the rest of us fishermen.</Text>

<review>The girls working here are very friendly and efficient! They do a great job and have reasonable prices. The threading lasted almost a whole month! They wore masks and made sure everything was sanitized between customers. Very clean inside. Definitely recommend coming here!</review>< Response>

Been coming here for a couple of years now, great service. Anu is one of a kind in so many ways. She is gentle, nice and an awesome threader. She also has high standards for whomever she has working with her. Anu is a trustworthy business woman, I cannot say enough.<//Text>

<Text>2020 Edit: NEW lady, she's really good. My eyebrows look amazing.

The 1 star review is right about only 1 lady being able to do eyebrows BUT BOTH WOMEN ARE VERY KIND AND POLITE. THE LADY THAT DOES MY EYEBROWS IS THE LIGHT SKINNED LADY *SORRY DON'T KNOW THE NAME. BUT I KEEP COMING BACK!</Text>< pictures>

<review>Came from out of state with hopes of finding a good last minute place to fix my eyebrows and chose this place based on reviews and I am glad I did! They did such such an amazing job! I was a walk-in and luckily nobody was there so I was attended quickly and the girl doing my threading was good about asking me what I was looking she did exactly what I wanted. Now the only sad thing is they aren't here in Washington :(</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

The lady who did my brows was really nice but I can’t say she did my eyebrows well. She cut off my arch and did a horrendous job at shaping them. I worked on growing them out but she just made them thin without any real shape and didn’t clean them up well. Def won’t be visiting again.<//text>

The technician was very sweet, got me in very quickly when I walked in. Although she couldn't make my brows perfect just yet (the last tech from another place totally jacked them up), she cleaned them up, pre-shaped them so as they grow back in, they'll be right! They look much better than before.<//Review>

<text>Every time I have been in to see this dentist someone is coming in complaining. At first I thought it was people being rude but I realize it’s definitely not that. The staff is great and friendly but the dentist herself never seems like she knows what’s going on. She’s nice enough but just not organized. The staff almost seem to keep her straight and focused. I’ve been here 4 times and 3 out of those 4, treatment changed when I got there because they were unaware of the plan. Today I came in and the dentist was asking me which teeth she was to pull from my son. I’m not the dentist, she is. Definitely not going to have her work on my child’s mouth if she’s not sure the plan beforehand. I’m so disappointed and honestly frustrated. I’m finding a new dentist today. Let me also say that I’ve been to bright now dental other locations and loved it, it’s definitely not the business itself -just this specific dentist.<//text>< user_name>

<review>This dentist in Azusa has ruined my teeth. Do not go here. I had a chipped tooth and needed a crown on a different tooth. I had to wait over a month to get the crown actually permanently fixed on after she ground my tooth down to the nerve,  due to the pandemic. It's now been over a month since getting the permanent crown and it still hurts to put any pressure on it to chew. My teeth now don't close right and sometimes slip and make scratching chalkboard like feelings in my mouth. She also did not actually do anything to my chipped tooth, even though she said she filled it and charged my insurance for it. My tooth has since chipped even more. Now I have to find a new dentist and pay out of pocket to actually fill in my chipped tooth and hopefully redo my crown.</review><name>Superstar Whimsy</name>< pics>

<Text>I came to return a bike tire and they said I had to put it in a bag the lady said I could go buy it but in the return instructions they didn't say anything about how to do it, AMAZON does, super easy and well explain, so I had to go and buy a bag envelop and a marker then I came and the lady said you don't need to write on it just to put it in a bag, wouldn't it be easy to provide a bag ???? Also her attitude, sad! Next time Amazon and Target for sure!<//Text>< username>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I called in and asked them if they took my insurance and how much my copay would be luckily they did it was only $10.00 compared to another place I had called in  (Azusa Gentle Dentistry was going to charge me $199.00 because they said that my insurance has a big copay ) So I decided to stay with Bright now ! they scheduled me right  the same day since I had a really bad toothache (wisdom tooth). They were able to take some X-Rays and prescribed me medication for the pain and inflammation which I took next door to CVS . And now I have an appointment for my wisdom tooth removal not excited about it at all , but I’m happy they were Anel to take me on the same day and give me something fife the pain thank you staff and doctors ☺️</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1589996709701, 'text': 'Hello Nancy!

All I can say is that I'm getting my teeth fixed finally after going to a few dentist that wanted to charge me mega money.  This dental office is honest and works with their patients financially.  1st dentist I know that dont take advantage of their patients. I recommend 5his dental office to everyone.  Staff is very kind and friendly.<//review>

<GmapID>0x80c327c67fb75931:0x76414e7056715cf6< /GmapID><review>I went in for a deep cleaning after a long absence from the dentists office. Paid cash.
I was visibly nervous. The dentist did my "deep cleaning" in under 7 minutes. When I got home I could literally see plaque on my teeth... nothing was done !  So they see I'm more scared than normal so they take my $300 and do nothing. Unfortunately you can't prosecute this type of thief. My new dentist says my deep cleaning will take approx 70 mins.

After to being asked to contact them to discuss the issue. I was given a one sentence email response. "the matter has been looked into."
No it wasn't.< /review><user_name>Baloo Balucifer<//user_name><Pics>None< /Pics><Rating>1</Rating><date>1574813005655</date>< UserId.>

THE BEST DENTIST OFFICE! I have been a patient for 5 years and this location always keeps me smiling. I've always had a great experience with the staff and the doctors. The staff is amazing and very helpful with any and all questions I may have. I trust the treatments the doctors have given me and am very happy with my overall experience every visit. Definitely recommend this location for long term dental checkups.< /review>

We entered the building first time, they took time to check whether our insurance has dental eligibility or not , we waited and waited , as we know it takes time, after finding not eligible , she suggested to go ahead with 40 dollar option,  not 29 dollars option. I thought to give a try and said yes, actually it saved 20 bucks for second time no fees. All the equipment is very high end, impressed with the x ray assistant and then went to doctor place. Doctor looked serious , but after meeting her, she is one of the nice beings and quite loving. The assistant who helped her also nice. They told about all the issues and the amount they charge at the end. We went with what ever urgency we have related to headache due to toothache. To wonder it was reasonably cheaper compared to all groupon , other orthodontics. Try one time,  this should be go to place for any dental issues in USA.< /text>

We're completely satisfied and would definitely recommend this office to our friends and family. As a matter of fact, my daughter already referred her friend who already became your customer! 😉
Your front desk staff, Silvia and Anna, are exceptional and that's the way business is supposed to be, "front line" great attitude.
We'll see you in the future for any needs we might have.<//review>< Pictures>

< Review>
We made it a point this week to take care of our dental needs for me, my husband and our son. We do have an HMO through Cigna which helped combat the cost of the dental work. The staff is friendly and responsive (they use text messaging & email to confirm appointments) Our 6 year old was very proud of himself after his pictures (x-rays) were taken. He even received a certificate to Shakey’s in his goodie bag! We already made our appointments for our next 6-month checkup. Thank you Bright Now.</Review>

Very unprofessional. I was treated poorly and overcharged.
Actual dental treatment was not well done.
Once you become a victim of this place there is no recourse.

<Text>We had been to this place once before and did not enjoy it, but we figured we would give them a second chance. It was worse the seconds time around,  the food was very bland and they didn't have green sauce and the sauce they had was not good. They have some breakfast, but no toast for the breakfast.

We are from Puebla and this food does not come close to the delicious food from that region of Mexico.  If you are looking for a real Mexican restaurant don't let this place fool you.<//Text>< pictures>

<review>This is the best Mexican food in the immediate area. The only downside is the price and weird atmosphere. The food is good but the price adds up quickly so stick to regular portions and it's ok, their plates and burritos are actually decent size!

By atmosphere I mean it acts like a hybrid Sit Down/Take Out restaurant but in a rather cramped location. I still eat here often though because I do like their food, especially some Nachos.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Here's the thing: to get local flavor, homemade cooking, and cheap food made with real ingredients, you sometimes have to put up with long waits and dirty floors.
La Poblanita is totally worth it. The house-made salsa has a nice kick to it, and is smooth enough to eat a whole bunch before the food arrives. The portions are manageable, which reflects to fair price.
When someone from out of town asks for good Mexican food, take them here.<//text>

Way over priced, the food is good but normal, nothing out of the ordinary. The biggest disappointment is that they tried to charge me more than the price they had on the board. I told them they over priced me and they gave me my money back, I can tell you I know for sure they did not over price me by mistake, it was on purpose. They lost a customer for $.75 they didn't even get to keep. I would not recommend this place.< /Text>

This wing stop is amazing in taste and portions! We come here at least every week and most employees know us by name. Big shout out to the staff for the delicious wings and bomb fries every time.
We are really thankful for all of them always make our night so relax and enjoy some very delicious wings!
Best Wing stop forever💗<//Text>

They try hard to keep customers happy. Overall happy with meal quality and delivery. The cashier had to deal with an interior customer but managed to keep her cool.< /Review>

Purchased a 30 piece wings veggies and fries. Out of 30 pieces we got four drumsticks all the rest were flats. Fries were cold and undercooked. 4 carrot sticks and 4 celery sticks. Enough for 1 each for a family of 4....are you kidding! Called to complain and the manager was very dismissive.< /Text>

The food turned out yummy. However, when we ordered the employee said it would take 20 minutes. We waited 40 minutes and had cold fries. 😔😔</Review>

They usually make my wings done fairly good and always give me extra sauce if I need and usually have good customer service however they do take their time and can be slow I wouldn’t recommend for a quick bite but their deals on Monday and Tuesday are really good if you like boneless wings< /Text>

YOU NEED NEW MANAGEMENT!!! The manager old lady wants to tell me to pull my mask up all the way when one of the young men working in the back had his down. If you’re going to be rude to customers, make sure your employees are in line. Worst wing stop ever</Review>

Disappointed 😩 this is my first time eating here and I was very excited, got my order (garlic fries and spicy wings) and it looks and smells AMAZING , everything is absolutely flavorless and just tastes like salt. The wings aren’t even close to spicy, like at all.<//Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>This location is consistently slow. You can count on waiting at least twice the amount of time quoted. I am given an estimated time of 18-21 min.  On average it takes 40-50 min. When I ask why it is so long, I am told “they are working on it”. I have had them make a group order that was placed after myself and others served first.  The staff is unprofessional. On more than one occasion in this location I have heard  profanity and vulgar language used by staff.  I do not write reviews very often, but I felt the 3.7 stars they have are not earned. I will not return to this location ever. I will be trying to contact ownership one corporate. I would recommend FireWings or going to any other Wing Stop.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Placed an online order here for 10 boneless, tenders, fries and large ranch. When arrived to pick order, I checked the bag and instead of the large tub of ranch, I received 5 little cups. 5 little cups is nowhere close to the large tub. I asked for the large tub, but they said they don't have those anymore. I asked for a refund of the ranch, and they refused it too. Oh forgot to mention that they jacked up the price of the large ranch too. This is another location that I will never visit again.< /Review>

The food has way too much salt. Definitely not a healthy choice. Couldn't even eat it 😭. Everything had a lot of salt.<//Review>

Ten piece and a 6 piece combo.  Delivered through DoorDash there was no fries with either order. I called and got no response from the manager. No offer of a refund or suggestion of how they could make it right. I’ve heard stories of poor customer service here and now I’ve experienced it. I won’t be back.< /review>< Pictures>

Service was not welcoming. Felt like they'd rather have us leave. Despite that, I gave them a 20% tip in hopes that they don't make my meal half-assed. Immediately after my tip their moods went up but their service was still less than adequate. One of my boneless mild chicken nuggets had who knows what in the center. I didn't eat the rest and the fries were so covered in seasoning I couldn't finish them. Please visit another location. The one by in n out off of Fairway Drive is worth the drive.< /text>

I am labeling this place purely as "okay" because I have been here one other time and was severely disappointed. My first time there I ordered in-store, waited 30 minutes for my food (boneless wings) and they just... did not seem right. They seemed undercooked? Chewy? Rubbery? Whatever it was I threw most of it away and was very unhappy... fast forward almost a year and I try them again for their .60 cent boneless wing Monday. I ordered online, got all my food cooked "well done" and came to pick it up. I showed up early so I had to wait but not nearly as long as ordering in-store. Overall, I was VERY impressed. I guess the secret is getting it all well done because my wings tasted perfectly cooked, I got plain and Garlic Parm flavor. Absolutely delicious and will be coming back. Their fries are good too! Cajun seasoning, I think. Only downside is they charge 1.09 for a dipping sauce.</Text>

Tried the Korean bbq flavor wings for the first time and they were so good! But also tried the seasoned fries for the first time and they tasted sweet, like they put sugar in them. They were also soggy. So won't get those again. All in all good food though!</review>

Good place for a quick bite of hot wings. Many different types of wings and decent sides as well. Maybe not the caliber of Buffalo wild wings but a good place to eat at and many locations. Not many Buffalo wild wings around and there are plenty wing stops. A ton of different sauce combinations you are sure to find something for everyone here. Not overly pricey and they have large order specials as well if you want to have a luncheon party to go.</text>

I went to pick up an order for door dash. Have not personally eaten here, but I would not recommend it. I walked in and the place smelled like a sewer. Looked clean but I wouldn't want to eat something from a kitchen that smelled like that.</review>

The food is good. Don't get me wrong. But the service is ridiculous. They're rude. Not helpful.and our food was cold because they didn't call out our name. Also, asked for our card to verify our name. When she hadn't done that for LITERALLY anyone else. We sat there and watched at least 10 people get their food. Won't be returning</Text>

Wings are good, but the staff is very unprofessional. Music was completely inappropriate playing off someone’s cell phone, male employee talking about how he has lice, F bomb dropped numerous times with little kids in the building. Complete shame, I will not return to this location! Fire wings has a new regular. Even my 16 year old son, said “the only thing they have going for them is their uniform is clean.”< /review>

Terrible personnel’s, the old cashier lady tries to purport she is really polite and professional, my online order for pick up took too long, while she was humiliating people’s accent  and the tall young African- American female very relax was sitting and having her lunch( fries).<//Text>

I don't eat any kind of meat so I can't comment on that food but the fries are fantastic! The seasoning they put on it makes it so delicious. My mouth is already watering just writing this. Lol< /review>

I've only started going to Wingstop a month ago and I love it so much I have spent more than $100 already.  My favorite flavors are hickory BBQ and the mango habanero, however it might be too spicy for the average customer.<//Review>

<text>This is like a reliable employees are always nice and polite! If you place your order and it says it'll be ready in 20 minutes it will be ready in 20 minutes everything is consistent. Although I do feel like the lemon pepper wings are not as flavorful as they used to be but that applies to all Wingstops in general< /text><Response>None< /Response>< date>

This location is subpar. I tend to always have issues with my orders every time I order from this location. They can be as small as a missing ranch or as large as missing a whole item from my order. Bottom line my order should be correct the first time around. This location also doesn't deliver which makes it even more inconvenient<//Text>

Super slow service. Everytime I order online to pick up I always find myself waiting an extra 10 minutes to get my order after I arrive exactly at my pick up time. This happens everytime. Dissapointed. Don't recommend going there if your on lunch break. Defeats the purpose of online ordering. Wings weren't all that great ither.</Text>

I think the workers are friendly. This wingstop is in a predomonatelt white area where there are Russian, Irish and hispanic.
I feel some of the comments was predijust coming from some of the commentators. When you cook in a kitchen you sweat yet O have never seen these guys pouring sweat. I have watch how they would great people when they enter and I haven't seen anything like the comments say. Maybe tge should talk to the workers like I do whether than looking for the negative.< /Review>

It was so bad and be careful before you make the trip to that restaurant make sure if they have the deal you have in the coupon cup I went and take my coupon and they said they don't take it I was so disappointed so that is false advertising< /review>

So so. Could've been better. Wait person kept forgetting what we'd ask for didn't present the check told us verbally???? Final charge was rather high for 2 people ordering a salad and steak meal. Food was good. Felt very unorganized and super crowded.<//Review>

The food was really salty i think they did it on purpose because i complained about the happy hour menu  which they said they didnt have one and it clearly says starting at 3 no end time. They also didn't sing happy birthday and she didn't want to bring my change back  ask me did i want to look at the bill a second time because  she needed a manager to get the change for her. It was bad enough i paid 90$ for that horrible food without complaining  why would I  give them and extra 10$. They couldn't even sing happy birthday  talking about they ran out of candles and the dessert that they give out  for birthdays . What really threw me out was the false advertising< /Text>< date>

Food was good. There seem to be confusion when who was next to be seated. If they can get that together and sit people faster then eating here will be a better experience for all.</Review>

Semi-authentic style Mexican food as re-imagined by Americans. However, the Happy Hour cocktails help you forgive the lapse in authenticity. I can't call it memorable, but that may be the margaritas fault.<//Review>

Unfortunately the dining is right on Lakewood Blvd and the noise sucks but it's outdoor dining, they try to make it as nice as possible for you. While the outdoor dining isn't the greatest they make up for it with the service, it's too notch and on point. My wife and I both got the pick three combos with the barbacoa, delicious. My daughter's got the salmon and the fish tacos. The salmon with the sauce was delicious but the fish in the taco's were a little bit over cooked. Might not get them deep fried next time. The salsa and chips are great. All in all we had a great time. What more do you need, family and some good Mexican food. We'll be back.< /review><name>Jose Garcia<//name>< date>

The food is great one of my favorite restaurants that’s the 1 stars for. Customers service I give a -10. What’s the point of making reservations if there going to make you wait for 1 hr to seat you after your reservation time. I do understand they’re pretty busy, but then they should just say first come first serve no reservation. After waiting for about half hr they tried giving us the worst table ever that has been empty since we arrived. I told her we didn’t want that table that if that was the point that table has been empty since we arrived. Why make us wait 1/2hr to seat us there? Then Juliana when ahead and said, “some people have to wait 3hrs. What is that supposed to mean? She made it seem like she didn’t  care how long we’ve waited. Worst customer service ever! Then I ask to speak to there manager and he came out and I explained what was going on. I don’t know if he was understanding me because his English was very bad so I decided to talk to him in Spanish and he was the rudest person ever. He said, “if I tell you in English or if I tell you in Spanish it’s going to be the same answer we have no tables. I said, so what’s the reservations for? He, Mr Rodriguez scream and said, “I need you to leave I’m refusing service. What service? My daughter came and said, mom let’s just go we don’t need this. We left across the street where they saved our night and gave us great customer service.< /Text>

<review>Upon arrival, we waited about 20 minutes to be seated,  although available seats could be seen. After being seated, there was a foul smell and I asked to be relocated. The waitress that assisted us appeared to have been a little intoxicated. As she was taking the orders, I asked her if she would be able to remember all the food requests (she did not write anything down)? I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought, oh she's good😃 Well, of course she messed up the orders, never bought additional napkins & other items as requested. To add insult to injury our food was COLD when it arrived at the table😲 The waitress was dancing with the customers and carrying on as if she was at a salon. The manager on duty didn't seem to have a problem with the terrible service the employee displayed 🙃<//review>< Pics>

El Torito used to be my favorite place to dine out with family and friends, but now it seems that the taste of the food as gone left. When I think of Mexican food I think of a dish that is well seasoned with plenty of flavor, and El Torito was that place for me. I don't know if the cooks are not that experienced with the food items, or if it's just a lack of care when preparing these dishes. But when you think of paying $23 dollars for a meal on more than one occasion and the taste of the food is bland, not only do you feel let down, but money has been wasted. I do hope that in the future El Torito do better so that they can once again be my favorite place to dine out. Until then, I will have to look further, and most likely will not return back to this restaurant.< /text>

Great place to eat!
Even if it looks really packed the staff will attend you fast! If they say it will take 20 min, they will call your phone in 20 min! Not like other places that you will wait for so long after they told you 30 min or 1hour wait and still wait! Love this place highly recommended!<//review>

A little pricey but good food, lots of parking, friendly service. They have canopies set up for outdoor dining as well as a DJ playing music for nighttime enjoyment. They also have alcoholic beverages, to go, like margaritas. They come in glad containers, sealed and ready to drink. You can get your meal and drinks ready for pick up if you call in advance or order when you arrive and take it to go. The wait time for a pick up order is not too bad.< /text>

Very clean, service was great. Food was good but did not have the authentic Mexican flavor. Maybe it was the macho plate that I ordered that day other this were really really good. No spicy salsa not even mild. I love me some delicious spicy salsa to go with my meal. Overall, place was good.</Text>

Really nice set up during Covid times. Outside dining. Not a long wait. Good service. Food was a little lost in taste. Had the mole Verde enchiladas. Rice tasted old. But appetizers were really good! Thank God for that.</review>

The food was alright. Everything wasn't fresh. The customer service could be a lot better we were rushed to order and when she got my name wrong she was like ok. Two of the girls were rude it seemed because they were overwhelmed they didn't care about customer service. It was sad because it seemed like the manager was really trying to make sure everything was going smooth.</Text>

Arrived at 520p was told they were going to check on food. 545p comes they did not come back so I asked someone else who went to check. Any how come to find out they did not start making my food until I got there. Mind you I ordered 1 week in advance with a catering coordinator and of course payment had been deducted from account upon scheduling catering. I was 1 hour late serving my guests that were expecting to eat at 6p. While there I attempted contacting catering coordinator and asked to speak with a manager and was told they were on a phone call (for 45 mins).< /Text>< pictures>

<text>I came to El Torito to celebrate my birthday with 4 of my family members. After 30 min of waiting I decided to check if we were almost next to be seated, only to find out the hostes forgot to put us down on the waiting list. While I spoke to the manager about the matter he proceeded to then blame us for not being put on the list stating that we were at fault for not making sure we got the confirmation message (mind you I had no idea we were suppose to get a confirmation text because I've never been here before). We ended up staying because we couldn't make it to any other restaurant. After 1 hr of waiting we finally got seated. Ryan our waiter was friendly, however it took another 1hr 1/2 before we got our food. Another man served our food he wasn't in uniform with leads me to believe that he was the busboy and he was very rude.  Bottom line i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The service is horrible.</text>< rating>

<Text>I walk in at 9:05 PM on 10/19/2109. The place is fairly empty. The parking lot is fairly empty.
I am looking forward to having El Torito since the one in Temecula where I live closed from what I believe was bad management. I walk to the hostess tell her table for two she politely ask my name and then tells me there is a 30-45 minute wait. So I sit down and notice my surroundings. Two managers (at least what I believe are managers are laughing and giggling with the pretty  hostess. It is 9:15 at night there is only one other party waiting. There is a guy in one of the dining rooms that looks to be a server vacuuming mind you they don’t close till 11. There is another server in my general view that is preparing that dining area ( filling the sugars, placing the table sets, and other things) As for as I can tell there is only one dining area open and the bar area. I guess the management is more concerned with leaving on time than customer service. With only two parties waiting and 2 employees occupied with other task also two managers more concerned with chatting up the hostess. I imagine this El Torito is on the closure list also. It is really sad that such a great company and staple in Southern California has upper management that has aloud such a quality establishment to fail. I know this first hand with the Temecula location. I frequently dined at this location and some would say to much. I use to love El Torito, but watched management run it into the ground.
It’s amazing that customer service is not first any more instead vacuuming and flirting with the hostess has taken precedence. I realize that the vacuuming is necessary but do it when the store is closed. No one should have to listen to an electric vacuum when they are eating at a restaurant.
No we did not stay and wait 45 minutes for our table

10/28
El Torito
You state in your reply to contact you on your website to talk further about the situation. Well I did that night, the same night I wrote this review and have heard nothing from you. So was this just a corporate response for the public to see. Kind of shows how the company cares about its customer.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>This location is the best El Torito I've been too. I was actually going to stop patronizing El Torito all together, from previous bad experiences. This location was clean, roomy and a great bartender. The food was pretty good aside from my shrimp being undercooked. It was a great experience. We we're celebrating a Birthday and it was a large party. The server did a great job. Just a couple of mishaps but pleasant no the less. Now I'm now organizing happy hour there for this week.</Text>< Pics>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>The food was great. The price was greatly reasonable. But most of the 5 star rating has to go with the service. Our waitress, Alex, was very professional and attentive to us (guest of 5, including my infant daughter). One of my guest and I were considering ordering a selection from the Chef's Special menu. However, being that it was already an hour before closing, Alex advised us that those particular meals would take longer to prepare so we both changed our choices. I truly appreciate Alex explaining that to us because we all had an appetite but didn't want to wait long for our orders.
At end of the night, Alex and the staff devoted some time to present one of my friends with birthday flan and sang HAPPY BIRTHDAY to her. I really appreciated the services of the entire staff. It was very thoughtful of them.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Just eat lunch with my wife and we’re very disappointed in the food prep. On this last Friday she had dinner with a friend and had the fajita tacos and told me how good they were. The shells were cooked nicely and were crisp.  Today they were soft and falling apart. She said they had bacon and mushrooms in them, but none today. Disappointing 👎🏻< /Text>

Tuesday Jan 29 2019, Time 5:15
We went today for Taco Tuesday
Waiter was a bit annoying
We asked info about Margaritas and he had no clue.
One Mango Margarita and a Strawberry Margarita had no alcohol taste, it was a strawberry smoothie not a margarita. El Torito Lame drinks .
Service was so so.
Plus a SURCHARGE for Good Service?
Be aware The Surcharge is for every party, weather one or twenty.
Technically speaking if I will pay a Surcharge, Service should be exceptional, El Torito in Lakewood is mediocre at best.</text>

Sunday brunch is ok. The omelet bar is great, taco bar too. Many side dishes and desserts too. Almost too much food. Well worth it. Mimosas free flowing. Yummy< /Text>

<Text>El Torito in Lakewood used to be a lot better. The carpet is dirty and the place seems like it needs a bit of a remodel.  The food there is authentic Mexican and very delicious. The salsa that they provide with the chips is delicious. Every plate that I have ever ordered has been authentic and great tasting.</Text>< response>

<resp>None<//resp><Text>This restaurant is a hidden gem near the Lakewood Mall. My family has been going to this restaurant for nearly 5+ years and I decided to write about the superior excellence. Jose R. is the most amazing server and has always made sure that he treated my parents with the most attentive style possible. The food is delicious and always prepared to be tantalizing. It is truly handicap accessible and they go above and beyond to ensure that a good time is had by the patrons. Simply stunning service and mouth watering food that will make you crave another margarita. Be sure and ask for Jose R. and tell him that Sherri said hello. Enjoy and bon appetite. <3< /Text><Date>1561308590209< /Date></record>

I love this place. One of my favorites spots forsure. Never fail to amaze me with their service and food. The staff are so friendly, kind and welcoming. The food is delicious, they serve a large amount of food which is awesome. They started us off with salsa and chips first, it was yummy. The main plate came out fast and Oh My Gosh it was DELICIOUS! Just what I needed. Happy customer! Thank you for the great service.< /Review>

<Text>Sunday Morning's are wonderful here... you are sure to return...!!
Bottomless Mimosas & all you can eat breakfast buffet. Be sure to tip your taco ladies, as you will appreciate how they fresh press and cook these hand-rolled pieces of dough into tortillas on the spot, I'm talking the FRESHEST ever...visit the omelette man, he is always happy to make any kind of omelette, while you wait, with only the FRESHEST ingredients...!!
PS...Don't forget ask for the orange juice...for your champagne.

<text>Look, their brunch isn't the best, but it's certainly not the worst. Best option is tacos with the fresh hand made tortillas. Bottomless mimosas will help clear the palate. My personal favorite is the Cadillac Margarita because it's less acidic. Service rules.< /text></record></dataset><record>

The door person was nice and professional, he he was able to charge me immediately, it was a medium sized order and was prepared and ready in about 10 minutes. It gets very busy so just communicate to then thoroughly and you will have your order just fine. 5 stars<//Text>

Upon arriving to have a bit eat. I had to use the restroom and let's just say it needed a lot of attention. A lady was in there washing up and it was just nasty. We finally get our seat right in front and the area where we were seated was also not clean. Okay! We finally get our food and it was good, but warm, not hot. With that being said. I think I will not return.<//Review>

We attended a BD dinner last night. Reservations were made for 20-25 ppl. The Manager was informed that we might hv more coming & she accommodated us. We had 1 waiter for a party 40🙄 Needless 2 say it became a little chaotic 😬 One of the guest asked the Manager can the waiter hv some help? The Manager was so #UNPROFESSIONAL!!! She started arguing w/the guest and asked US to leave an  pushed the guest 😡 I was so embarrassed!!!  My Husband & I paid our bill & left.<//text>

I’ve been going to Taco Tuesday at El Torito for years now. The location always depends on where I am at the moment. My experience at El Torito of Lakewood was a bad one.
It was my first time there and everything seemed just like any other El Torito. One of the main reasons that I go to Taco Tuesday at El Torito is specifically for the tacos del pastor. When I was at the line to get my tacos. I was informed that they didn’t have any more cooked meat of el pastor. So one of the employees went inside to double check and came back to let me know that I could wait 15 minutes for them to cook some more of El Pastor meat. i had agreed and went back to my table. I went back 20 minutes later to give them an extra five minutes cushion in hopes that it was ready. When I went back to the taco stand the El Pastor meat tray was still empty. At that point the employee went back to the kitchen to double check on the meat and to my luck she came out just to tell me that they didn’t have anymore El Pastor meat. I felt like I was lied to all along when they could have just told me that they didn’t have anymore El Pastor from the beginning. At this point this just ruined my whole experience and not to mention put me in a bad mood. I waited a total of 25 minutes just to be disappointed by this location!< /Review>

<Review>I’m officially addicted to taco Tuesday at the Lakewood Mall as soon as I walk in I go straight to the back area near the taco bar. I always get the beat service ever from Gio. And the manager Derrick is always helpful making sure I’m ok with a smile on his face. Nothing means more to me then walking in a restaurant with friendly staff and good food. I get the best of both worlds every Tuesday. Thanks for creating a welcoming environment Derrick. And Gio is the best server ever.< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Salty salty salty food! I got the steak tacos with enchiladas and it was so freaking salty. I could not finish my dish. I really dont remember el torito being this bad but maybe its just this location. First of all our waiter was so dead - we were here for a bday dinner and he wasnt helpful at all with the menu. He didnt light up any fajita dishes nor did he try to find a bday sombrero for our bday girl. The group photos he took of us were all blurry and baad. The food was gross for the price  - my rice was super sweet like sugar and my entree was pure salt. I would not go to this location again.</Review>< Pics>

<text>We came today for the Thanksgiving buffet and all I can say is WOW. REALLY. Cold food and the most limited choices I have ever seen at a buffet. My enchiladas were cold and of course the cheese was not melted because it was cold. I asked for a small piece of turkey and was given a bite. Literally a bite. Stuffing....cold.  sweet potato....hard as a rock...and fly's hovering around the dessert area. This was truly the worst experience I have ever had here at El torrito. 2 people 2 drinks 2 buffets. $93.46.  this is sad. I feel like I was robbed for almost $ 💯. I could of went many other places and spent $ 💯 and had waaaaaay better food and service.  Thumbs down El torrito.<//text>< user_id>

We don't really go here but we had a coupon. We sat by the bar so we we're able to watch tv. The waitress was very friendly and took our order right. There were 6 of us 3 kids and she seemed to serve all of us with great hosptality
Food was delicious good proportions I was so full. The place was clean and bathroom was very clean too. Only thing really didn't like is that all staff stay in front by hostess and it just seems to packed when u walk in. Can't wait to go back.</Review>

<review>the host was nonchalant and told us to find our own booth. this restaurants is a bit unsanitary
the bus boys wiped the seats off then wiped the table with the same rag. we had to request that he wipe the table down a 2nd time because it was sticky.
the manager apologized and explained that the tables were so old, that even after wiping them down, they still feel sticky. She also stated that they've been ignored,when asked it the tables could be replaced. both  the manager and server were very nice and our meal was complimentary however, I'm reporting this in hopes that the higher ups see this post and replace those tables to ensure they're providing a service in a healthy environment<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

We Sat in the Cantina. There were 2 servers who disappeared and were ghost the majority of the time. We had to flag the server for a menu, drinks, and for silverware, just about everything. They never checked on us to see if we wanted more adult beverages or anything.  I wouldn't recommend this location. The location we frequented the most in Long Beach closed so we came here. Now we remembered why we didn't come to this location. It was the service. It SUCKS!!! 🤷🏾‍♂️< /Text>

Quick place to get a bite to eat. Select days they do have an all you can eat. Spicy salsa. Lunch service was fast and the waiter was wonderful to us.  Stayed on top of refills, chips and salsa!< /review>

<Resp>None< /Resp><text>Nothing special. Food needs more spices...even salt would help. Corn tortillas for my fajitas all had holes and splits in the middle because of the thinness. Even when I asked for replacements, they were the same way. Quantity of food is great, quality needs much work.< /text><userid>112000676645533900640< /userid>< pics>

My God mother's Birthday! It was a large party! If you can get a separate check pls as in the beginning! Lol. I had the Shrimp enchiladas! Tasty with the cream sauce. I dont care for the signature beans. I dont think the have black beans. A lil skimpy on the corn cake. I love that stuff. The waiter was happy to give me more. My cousin next to me had a Shrimp taco salad it was nicely put together. Haven't been here in so long.<//text>

Lunch buffet is awesome!   They've really stepped up their game.   The servers are on point and the food is delicious.   They bring the chips out hot and fresh.  By far the best lunch buffet.</Review>

It's always been one of my favorites but I think they're having financial problems and last week at their Sunday brunch the quality was way down across the buffet.  Still good but not worth the higher prices.</Text>

<response>None< /response><rating>2< /rating><review>Service was great. Our waiter was awesome. Now the bad part. I've been sick since I left yesterday. Headaches. Upset stomach. You don't want to know what's happening in my bathroom currently. I only went here because it was the only one near at the moment. You walk in and there are 3 security guards walking around you like you're in a prison and they aren't friendly at all, they Don't even smile. The clientele seem to be on the rowdy side. Our waitress in the bar area was amazing, she was a young girl, had her hair in a ponytail but I forgot her name. The rest seemed very  uninterested in being there. So all and all. 2 stars for our waitress. Without her it would be a 1.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80dd32f142b8252b:0x1af197c9399f5231< /Gmap_id><time>1496877927281<//time><username>Jay P</username><user_id>113596649743304964169<//user_id><pics>None</pics></record>

The food was good. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the queso was really watery.</Text>

Service was really good. Food was ok. My soup was way too salty and my salad tasted old. But the carpet. Omg. I could feel the grim through my shoes. You cant even see the colors or patterns anymore.< /text>

Waited 30mins or more to be seated(there were 2 adults 6 children). I was told we we're waiting because the waiter didn't come into work yet. We we're finally seated ordered an appetizer $15 the waitress takes it upon her self to double the size so now it's $30 didnt notice until we payed the bill.<//text>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Terrible service, three times in last 3-4 months.  Same bad service, sat in a table for over 5 minutes without been acknowledge. Order El Niño after almost ten minutes this is what I got served!  My past two visits I put out with the bad service but 3 in a row must means something, the server said "that's the way is been served, want to talk with the manager" (with whom I have on my pass two visits), so this time I make the right decision, refused to put out with bad service, bad product quality and bad servers work attitude...cancel my order and leaved that location.
Consumers do not patronage bad services due to poor Management and labor control, where is the consumers/patrons the one who pay and have to settle for less.
Make you money/time worth.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKxt2xie06VwQUHDwgq9f1_o5YJ8LZ4ff8r-0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

<Text>Place needs an upgrade but pricing for the food is fine. Noisy kids around and management is ok with it.(my wife and I were not)

I will definitely recommend super Mex over el Torito but again it is a matter of choice.< /Text>< user_id>

<Text>You never can go wrong with El Torito. Free hot chips with spicy salsa and great dishes such as Sizzling Enchiladas.

This El Torito was terrible has really gone down since my lady visit 15 years ago. The young greeters have terrible attitude and down right disrespectful the place had an odor like old carpet and dirty floors..
The manager was decent but needs to work on the place. Revamp immediately</Text>

<review>One odd the worst experience all the way around.  This place ig's a MAJOR NO!

Service - Slow, inattentive and will order your food wrong.  Took me 20 minutes to get my drink!  Wtf

Food - after an hour of waiting when you're hungry even cardboard tastes good.

Manager - will say anything to keep the peace...she promised my food would come out...it never did.

There are soooooo many things going on wrong for this "fine" establishment.

I wasn't the only one complaining as well.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>1< /Rating><user_name>jason lambert< /user_name><gmap_id>0x80dd32f142b8252b:0x1af197c9399f5231<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Horrible experience horrible service! Told it was an hour wait and after waiting that was told that the server wasn’t ready to attend us and it would be 10min. 45 min after that, we finally get seated and we aren’t attended to until 25 nun after. The service was slow after we waited 45min for them. No one else tried to help us. Horrible restaurant, they just told us sorry for the service and they would give us a free soup at the end. They just couldn’t do anything right. If In the area at all to eat avoid this restaurant all together and just go across the street to  IHOP, nothing can be worse than this lousy restaurant.< /Text>

Went to the one on Candlewood. In Lakewood
The bar is a bit dated. Restrooms need a huge update. Kinda small area. Other guests are close enough to hear your conversation< /review>

Just terrible service at this location. Plus just rude customers too had to listen to a child cry out of just being spoiled brat as the family did nothing to attend to the matter. They were regulars by the way they was treated. Which made me and my woman believe they where family with the employees. Terrible all around wont be attending this location ever again< /review>

I was surprised to see an El Torito that serves buffet. We drove 8 miles to go because we got a coupon by mail. I should say the trip was worth it. We will go again to this place. Besides the many items that we normally could pick and eat in conventional buffets, waiters in this store mixed vegetables, dressing, and sides to make the salad individually for each customer. Felt like we were being served even though it was buffet. Highly recommended.<//text>

They do not like to provide individual tabs to large groups for their convenience. Some waiters are polite, prices on the rise...< /review>

<name>Rodney S< /name><review>BIRTHDAY MONTH=BIRTHDAY COUPONS=HAPPY RODNEY

Free entrée (up to $12.99)

Having been to the other nearby El Torito locations at the Long Beach Towne Centre (now closed) and in La Palma, I decided to visit the Lakewood location to redeem my free entrée coupon for their lunch buffet.

Checking out the spread, I immediately noticed El Torito's lunch buffet had received an upgrade since last time I dined on their buffet.  New options of meat, ceviche & even dessert welcomed me as I filled plate after plate.

After polishing off a heaping mound of plates, I found I enjoyed what El Torito now has to offer with their lunch buffet.  My favorites were the spicy soup (whose name escapes me) and the chocolate chip cookie brownies.

Besides the lunch buffet, El Torito has many daily specials, including Happy Hour & AYCE Taco Tuesday.

Service was good.  The attendant was quick to refill my soda water & he automatically redeemed the birthday coupon for me when I received the bill.  Plenty of seating around the restaurant.  I sat at the cantina, where I could easily access the buffet.

Parking is via a private lot.  El Torito is on the corner of Lakewood & Candlewood, outside of the Lakewood Center.

No complaints here!  El Torito is one of the good ol' reliables when my birthday month comes around.  The newly revamped buffet offers a varied selection of items to consume, which would appease all types of folks, from vegan to carnivore.  Service has been equally on par, from my experience thus far.  I've been satisfied during every visit and wouldn't mind coming back again.

Highly recommend!

<review>I came on a Saturday to this restaurant with my wife and kids. While eating the tortilla chips I encountered a thick black hair in the chips. I called the manager to cancel my order and he asked me why and I told him because I found a hair in my food. He didn't seem to care. What bothered me the most is that the waiter that took my order was in the back laughing at us, not to mention I didn't get an apology from the manager and waiter.</review><date>1444516494009<//date>< Response>

< Review>
This is the worst El Torito I have ever eaten at.  I ordered tortilla soup, it tasted like water, and there was a dirty spoon at the bottom of the bowl.  SICK..  They would not even take it of the bill.  We will never eat at this El Torito again.  A better place to get tortilla soup is at La Capilla in La Palma.  Fast friendly service.  And willing to make sure you are a happy patron.< /Review>

Service was fast and waiter was informal on the daily deals in case I didn't know. Food was delicious and in fact one the best El Toritos I have been to in all of LA.<//text>

<Text>Will not be coming back to this location. Ate in the bar. Our chips were cold and stale. Our waitress disappeared and rarely checked on us. Ordered tacos and they came out dry and burnt with not much in them. My worst experience at an El Torito to date.< /Text>< pics>

<text>I ordered 3, 3 item combos and only received one small bag of chips and 2 salsas.  When I asked if I could have more the manager said I could pay $5 to get more.  If they still refill the chip basket in the restaurant I should be able to get more chips.  The rice in all 3 combos was hard and crunchy and the maza that my chicken tamale was made from wasn't good.  I won't be going back here.</text><UserId.>101164818251866459673<//UserId.></record>

(Translated by Google) Because they make you wait to sit at a table, that's fine, but having many tables in the shade, they want to sit you in the sun, only because there are 6 dirty tables in the shade, which have been there since we arrived at the place 25 minutes and I don't know They clean, but they want to sit you in the sun ... the ones who clean the tables. They clean 2 glasses at the same time, they take about 5 laps to clean a table ... they are paying them to put them to work ... courage, if not, grab people with the intention of working

Porque te hacen esperar para sentarte en una mesa, esta bien, pero teniendo muchas mesas bajo la sombra , te quieren sentar en el sol, solo xq hay 6 mesas en la sombra sucias , que están desde que llegamos al lugar 25 minutos y no se limpian, pero ellos quieren sentarte en el sol... los que limpian las mesas. Limpian de 2 vasitos a la vez, dan como 5 vueltas para limpiar una mesa... les están pagando pongan les a trabajar ... ánimo, si no que agarren gente con ánimo de trabajar<//text>
