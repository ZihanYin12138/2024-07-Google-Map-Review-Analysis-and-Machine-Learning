A judgement-free experience for your next big transition! I was looking for a gender-bendable look and we figured out what style I wanted to start with together. Professional service + staff follows all current health/sanitation protocol.  I will def return, thank you Skylar!< /text>

Went in to the salon for the first time  a couple of weeks ago for a color, something different.  The day before my stylist Sky called me to chat about my hair and what I wanted.  Wow I have never had that kind of service before!  The day of the appointment she was on time and so kind and gentle, totally put me at ease.  My color was beautiful and she gave me a little trim to perk up my 15 month hair growth too, I left feeling like a movie star!

My 16 year old daughter liked my doo so much I took her in this past Saturday, she left with the best haircut she has ever had!  Bonus, Sky gave me a little boost to my color, gratis I might add.

Sky is sweet, talented and really wants you to feel special when you are at the salon but also when you are out rocking your coife!<//text>

I go to Bibo because my stylist, Sky, moved there and I will follow her wherever she goes. I get regular weekly blowouts from her and she makes my hair big & bouncy & Barbarella-like which I love. Plus she is gentle & always checks to make sure I am comfortable. She is very fun to talk to while she does my hair. We have developed a lovely friendship.</Text>

I botched my own hair dye job really good like coming out and wrecking my curls they totally fixed it. My new color tone that looks amazing, did a deep moisturizing treatment which made my curls come back and gave me a nice trim to make my curly fro a little more shape. LOVE THIS PLACE.</text>

< Review>
Sky is a wonderful human being! She is understanding of what your hair goals are and it's easy to chat, and feel at ease while being taken care of. She listened to what I was describing and did not struggle to understand what I wanted in a haircut.

My problem with my experience was I walked in with an idea of what I wanted with hair color but walked out with something completely different. I was hoping for light brown roots transitioning into pastel pink on the bottom (my hair is pastel pink already).

Since my last stylist used a different kind of chemical, Sky was not able to remove the staining it created from that previous visit, so instead of the light brown I wanted at my roots, we had to cover it up with a dark purple instead.

I appreciate the transparency and communication Sky made with me throughout the process and our limited options to pivot. We unfortunately trimmed much of the remaining pink after dying which I did not account for when we made the initial suggestions on where each color would start during the beginning. After washing out the dark purple, a lot of it also slid down to the bottom pink, darkening my overall look. Majority of my hair is purple now which is a bummer since it doesn't resonate with who I am. :(

Asian hair is tough to get right when it comes to coloring. Asian hair is also mad expensive to color--bottom line is I paid a hefty price for something I didn't want. But hey, it was a service provided to me so I'll respect that and pay it. It looks cool but just not me.

The intention of my visit was to begin transitioning from my pastel into a more natural look with the brown. This took me the opposite direction with the purple. I was trying to convince myself to like it more than I really did in the moment as a coping mechanism I suppose because the visit took such an unexpected turn. It's going to take some time to get used to it and I'll admit I am kind of in shock still, but want to treat this review as fairly as possible.

UPDATE
I'm very displeased because after my first wash I was in shock that any of the remaining pink is completely obliterated. As my 2nd and 3rd wash went on, the whole thing turned less magenta and more and more purple. I wish I was warned the purple would take over any remnants of pink or else I would have urged to pursue a different route. I am very sad about it because the original pastel pink took years to achieve and costed me thousands, only to get completely annihilated. I basically paid $500 on this service for something I don't want, it honestly feels so violating. Sigh.< /Review>

Julie did a great job taking care of me and was able to translate what I wanted.  She was able to let me know what my hair would like like depending on what route I decided to take and overall she made me feel very welcomed. I will definitely go back when I need my next cut. =)<//Review>

Jay is master stylist. Could not be happier with my asymmetrical lob -- a huge transformation from the long cut I've worn for years.
Jay listened to the style I wanted and got the length & weight distribution very very right.
Plus the scalp massage may have also been the best I've ever had. Found my new go-to :)</Text>

After a self-inflicted quarantine color fiasco, I was left with tangerine orange hair. By good luck, I contacted BIBO the day they reopened, and even though her schedule was quite full, Susie was quick to respond. She was kind enough to do my consult via video call, and incredibly sensitive to my needs and schedule. She went WAY over the call of customer service - even extending her hours to meet my schedule, so I could look normal again as soon as possible. Her color correction was on point, and she got me back to a natural-looking state in one appointment - and she was faster than any treatment I've ever had, previously! "Blow In, Blow Out" is the absolute truth - I cannot believe how amazing my service and experience with her was - and she's an awesome person, on top of it! Absolutely worth every penny - she even styled me so I could arrive at my next appointment polished, and feeling great. Susie is a true professional - her passion for truly informed haircare and technique is apparent, and I'm super excited to return for a Calligraphy haircut (she's the only provider in the Bay Area). BIBO has earned my loyalty, for sure - and I can't recommend Susie enough!< /Text>

I have been going to this salon for over a year and love it. The staff does an amazing job listening to the changes I want to make to my hair and always consults on what she thinks would work.   She keeps up with the styling/coloring trends so I know I can trust her to keep my hair looking current.< /Review>

It was an unbelievably lovely experience & I'm extremely happy about my new hairdo! Also, from beginning to end, Collette went above & beyond to make me feel relaxed. :D
The vibes in this place were amazing too, but coming here is definitely going to be a once-in-a-while treat for me-- I can't keep spending $345.00/visit. X.x
It's great, but a little too rich for my blood.< /review>

One of my best friends from my school days got married at the Fair view Metropolitan Golf Course in Oakland and this is where we congregated to get our hair and makeup done (in the case of the Bride) in the morning prior to the ceremony!

I cannot speak highly enough of this Salon! The stylist who did my hair, Leahla in was excellent in her skills and expertise in regards to her understanding of hair design and health! Not only was she a highly skilled  hair stylist/ designer, but she was extremely easy-going and comfortable to talk to!

The other bridesmaids where thrilled with their stylists Allie, who thrilled with her expertise of color and tone, in regards to Bethany's complexion. Alice was equally thrilled with the stylist flair of Corina!

The Bride Alison was thrilled with the excellent job that her team Haili and Jezabel ! She had her hair dyed and purchased extensions to match the length and color! She was so thrilled with how her hair came out! Her makeup, done by the very talented team, was beautiful and everyone at the wedding remarked on how beautiful the bride was!

The lady at the front desk was extremely helpful in helping us navigate the keurig and the side table of snacks, fruit, cheese and crack and fruit. She also noticed when my hair fell out of place and we quickly refinished the up-do toward the end of the session. How very observant and helpful everyone was!<//Text>

Awesome salon in Uptown - walkable from BART, love the atmosphere and amazing hair experiences. And you can BOOK ONLINE!!

I’ve come here for blowouts, cuts, and keratin treatments, and each time I come I learn something new about hair care. I even got advice for treating dandruff and don’t have to use dandruff shampoo anymore. Every stylist I’ve had has been so kind and friendly, and I love the community vibe.

Thank you for the great service and for making my hair look fabulous! BIBO is a special place :)< /Text>

Lovely experience at BIBO. I went in for a blow out and was super happy with my hair.  Corina was super sweet and she knew how to blow out my frizzy curly waves. It came out so smooth and sexy. It lasted about a week with some maintenance.  Definitely would recommend this salon to friends and family. I can't wait to go back!< /Review>

Angel did an amazing job with my balayage and  bang trim. She also did a great job on my partner’s bangs and hair color. They serve coffee and champagne for free I believe. The interior is hip. Will be returning. Beware: this place is really expensive. After tip the total for my partner and I was about 500 dollars.</text>

<text>I loved how when you walk in they ask you if you want a drink. And the employees are very friendly. It's a nice cozy place I recommend you make an appointment they normal don't have any free space. It's is worth the price. It's not overly expensive but not overly cheap. The best salon I have went to so far. I'll be staying with this salon.<//text>< pictures>

<review>Corina did a great job! I am very happy with my haircut, she framed my face and shaped my bangs beautifully. She took her time and totally spoiled me. My boyfriend came with me and was offered a beer! I opted for a champagne. The salon has a nice vibe, nice decor and friendly, smiling and welcoming staff. I would recommend this salon and will be returning here myself for my next cut!<//review>< pics>

I decided to check this place out after I saw my friends amazing hair cut she said she got at Bibo. I went to the same stylist Karina, who  gave me the best hair cut. Everyone has been complimenting me. She seriously was incredible. I highly recommend checking BIBO out.<//review>

I love the decor of this salon and the layout. Surprisingly enough it wasn't difficult to find parking and it was certainly easy to find! I booked with this salon because I found a groupon for a $25 blowout and it was well worth it. I called before to find out if they could use the less damaging- boar bristle round brush instead of the typical metal or ceramic and they provided so I booked, and so glad I did! After the blow out the manager gave me a package with sample products and discount cards. The salon is really doing well promoting and making the customers feel welcome back and taken care of. I will certainly be booking here again!<//Review>

< Review>
Chill place to watch games.

Food and drinks are pretty good. Had the club sandwich and my friend had the impossible burger. Solid options.

Later on, they offered a prime rib dinner special. Saw a lady order that and it looked pretty good. Maybe next time, will try it.

🍺 selection was pretty good. Some hard to find such as Saint Archer Hazy IPA and the Seismic Liquifaction Kolsch. 👍. Also had the basics like Sierra Nevada and Anchor Steam<//Review>

Wow.  A really unique spot.  The owner has a collection of SF Giants players bats throughout the restaurant.  The menu is simple with less than 20 items in total and they do them very well.  I had the wings, half Buffalo and half Asian glaze, they were awesome.  We had the fried cauliflower for an appetizer and yes I know, fry anything and it is better but it really was quite good.</Text>

Excellent new restaurant owned by the former Giants player Jack Clark. The service was outstanding and the food was great.  If you are a Giants fan you will be in heaven. Lots of memorabilia all over the place. We stopped in before the game and it turns out was a great place to watch Monday Night Football. I was wearing a Braves jersey and everyone made me feel right at home (even Jack Clark himself).< /text>

Came in when kitchen was closing down, the cook said to take our time and order. We were impressed because we expected bar food but the maple syrup wings were delicious and hamburgers were great! Gilberto the cook was so kind and cooked the food very well!! So glad we made the stop!< /text>

Friendly, neighborhood gem. Good food, friendly staff and great for Giant fans! New to the neighborhood so finding its way. Great post-work stop off. Definitely worth an Uber if you're in another part of the city. Had the Caesar salad with steak and it hit the spot. Great wine menu for a "sports" bar.< /text>

<review>For all you San Francisco Giants fans, young and old, you will find the mecca of Giants memorabilia at the Pine Tar Grill. David Martin is the owner, a life long fan and collector of everything San Francisco Giant you can imagine. We had a delicious old fashion hamburger, my first time at the restaurant. Can’t wait to come back and try some different dishes, as well as checking out more Giants as well.</review>< Pictures>

People often ask how to get a job like mine. I say don't worry about it do you want me to help you or not? Sometimes you can determine if potential client is going to be worth your time or just testing you. I can tell the very first minute that I talk with them. In my line of work it doesn't matter, I get paid either way and get fed too. Pine Tar Grill has never done me wrong, never. It's who you know and not what you know. The owner is fantastic and humble never pushing me to drink or eat more. If you're baseball fan especially the Giant's this place is your go-to place. I don't get paid to say this and gain nothing from here just getting the word out.</Review>

What a cool spot! If you are a giants fan (or a baseball fan...or even just a sports fan) this is a must visit restaurant. After living in the Midwest one of my main complaints about SF is the lack of sports bars or restaurants. I have finally found my place!

Pine tar is covered in authentic giants memorabilia (think of your favorite giants player from the past 30 years. I guarantee his game used bat is hanging somewhere in this restaurant) and TVs for watching the game, not to mention the jerseys, vintage photos, and autographs. The food is great, service is quick, and staff is friendly. So happy this place opened in SOMA and can't wait to become a regular. This place just opened so I would recommend visiting now before the word gets out.< /Review>

Great spot, food is delicious and very nice staff. Should do very well for all sporting events or to chill in a really cool space. Highly recommend.
Oh and yes it’s a Mecca to baseball, especially Gigantes!<//Review>

My favorite spot in SOMA to visit. I love everything from their menu and the staff is super sweet. They have a taco/burrito carry out special throughout the week. I’m not sure if it still goes on, but it’s a really great deal.

The avocado toast is delicious, the hot wings, the burger, and the chicken sandwich, and I don’t believe they can go wrong with anything else, but those are all a few of my favs.< /text>

My son and I stopped in for lunch and we immediately fell in love! Beautifully designed place (esp if you're a baseball and/or Giants fan!), very high quality food for the prices (my generally picky teenage son said his burger, onion rings, and garlic fries were each the best he's ever had!), and our server was very friendly and attentive to our every need! Thanks guys for a fantastic all around experience!</Review>

<Text>I've been going to Foster City Dental Care since the 1990s.  When I retired and lost dental coverage I tried several dentists on the Senior Advantage Plan.  Their service was nothing like I was accustom to.  A teeth cleaning takes more than 15 minutes. One dentist said I needed a root canal and a dozen crowns.  I knew he was trying to take advantage of me.  I went back to Dr. Imani's office and purchased their in office dental insurance coverage.  They confirmed  that I didn't need a root canal.  I'm paying more on my teeth than I use to but I'm much happier being back with Foster City Dental Care.  They do great work and I truly trust them.</Text><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

FRAUDS!
I went here recently for a check-up and they set me up to take X-Rays, so I asked, "will my insurance cover X-Rays?" And they replied "yes." Fast forward a month, and they mailed me a bill for the X-Rays, stating that my insurance didn't cover it. So I called them, and the woman on the phone was rude and defensive, telling me there's no way they could've known if my insurance would cover it, or not. So I told her, they needed to tell me that, so I could make an informed decision. I told her that if the answer is "we don't know" but they say "yes," that is a lie. It's fraud. They should be responsible for that cost, not me. She hung up on me.

They just sent me another bill, letting me know that if I don't pay it, they'll send it to collections.

Do yourself a favor and find another - honest - dentist.< /Review>

This dental office is very clean, efficient, and trustworthy. The dentist who worked on my teeth has been patient and experienced at complex issues. The office promptly gave out genuine estimation on the cost so you would not worried about after-visit surprise bill, which my previous dentist have fooled me so much....</Text>

The doctors and staff here is great. I have had a great experience each time I have gone for a visit. I used to be terrified of dentists but these folks have put an end to all my fears with their extraordinary care. I got 4 wisdom teeth extracted - two at a time. They guided me through the whole process and helped me with all the info I needed for the after care. Everyone was so great during the extraction. I also loved the fact that they called me after the surgery to check on me. Highly recommend these folks.<//Text>

<user>100297764690651864280</user>< Review>
I understand businesses are around to make money.  I get it, but it's really unfortunate when a dental office only cares about money and not the well being of their patients. I guess the days of doctors, or I should say dentists caring about their patients are long gone especially when it comes to Foster City Dental Care.  In my opinion you should look elsewhere for a dentist. One who cares about you and is willing to do what they can to help you live a comfortable life.  Not one that is more concerned about getting billable visits than doing the right thing and helping you out when you need it.  Maybe it's better to find a small practice with one or two dentists instead of several dentists and patients basically on a conveyor belt so as much money can be generated each day.   Sad</Review>

<text>I visited FCDC as a new patient today and was really happy with my visit. The front desk staff was excellent, and Dr. Tang took great care of me. She also did the cleaning herself; i'm used to a hygienist doing most of the work. They also called me earlier in the week to let me know of an opening in case I wanted to take advantage of it. I'll be returning.<//text><user_name>Michelle Toborowski< /user_name><resp>None< /resp><user>117018274726792648473</user><Rating>5</Rating>< Date>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>The staff here is incredibly professional and understanding. I was running about 15 minutes late for a morning appointment. I gave them a call letting them know and they said it was no problem. They do have a strict cancellation policy so I was afraid I would be subject to a fee. Luckily no fee.

My teeth always feel so fresh and clean when I leave this office. Gentle with the tools and solid advice to keep your teeth healthy. My shiny teeth and me!< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I was tricked by their $99 cleaning deal for new patients. If you are a new patient, I would suggest looking around. Moved to the area recently and went in for a cleaning service today. 1-hour appointment includes taking X-rays, taking photos of my teeth, measuring tooth-pockets, a maximum 10-min of cleaning, polishing and flossing (all together), and explaining why I need deep cleaning service and making a mouth guard. Three things made me feel that this place is questionable: (1) my teeth were not clean at all after being cleaned by a dentist (not a hygienist), there is build-up visible even looking at a car mirror; (2) when I questioned the results, the dentist's explanation was that my gum was very sensitive and she was concerned about me feeling painful. She will do the cleaning next time when I come in for a deep cleaning. I have had my teeth cleaned every 6-7 months during the past five years, and it was my first time to hear that a dentist is afraid of causing pain to a patient, so she cannot do the cleaning. Also, how could I trust a dentist to perform a deep cleaning on me, if she cannot even clean off the visible tartar between my teeth? (3) mouth guard seems to be a popular thing to recommend to patients here. They recommend a mouth guard to me was based on that I told them sometimes if I open my mouth for too long, I am afraid my jaw would have trouble to close. I am not sure if this concern can be solved by a mouth guard. In the meantime, they were recommending a mouth guard to another patient there too. Highly disappointed.<//review>

<text>Fast and courteous service. I like that procedures are explained thoroughly and that you are able to see Xrays/pictures of your teeth to be more aware of how to take care of them. The front desk lady was very nice in scheduling my appointments so that I had the maximum benefits from my insurance.

I've been going to Foster City Dental for over 10 years. My experience has always been very consistent: pleasant, relaxing and efficient. The hygenists (most recently Ada) are very personable but don't overload you with questions while your mouth is full of dental instruments. The same goes with Dr. Imani. High recommended!< /Review>

<text>In general, I have severe anxiety about going to the Dentist. I hate the sounds, the lights, and the overwhelming thought of teeth just falling out of my mouth. Ridiculous, I know. Getting me to the Dentist is like pulling teeth. (No pun intended.) I've been to many different Dentists in my life and was in the market for a new one. I happily stumbled upon their website the other day, and just finished my first visit. Hands down, by far, THE BEST office I've ever visited. It's run by the absolute sweetest group of women you can imagine. They were so caring, thoughtful, thorough, helpful, guiding and FUNNY! It will now be my permanent place, which has never happened in my life! And, I'm scheduled for my first filling...ever...and I'm really excited about it...bad, I know....But they're THAT good. I definitely will not be missing/dreading anymore 6 month checkups. Thank you Dr. Imani, Kathy, and staff!</text>< username>

My son is very anxious about going to the dentist. Indeed, in the past he has even been sick on the dentist! However, our experience at Foster City dental has been very positive. Both the assistants and dentist have taken a lot of time to explain procedures to my son. They have accommodated all of his requests and worked with him to make sure he is informed and comfortable.< /Text>

I have had a chance to see two of the three dentists of this facility so far. Dr. Liu and Dr. Poulose were both professional and competent in their work. Thank you. Also thank to the dental assistant who was providing care during the work. I will definitely return to this place if any future problems occur and encourage other people to go to this place as well.

Christine and Doctor Imani were extremely patient with a difficult client like me. Thank you.

Update:
It had been Four years that I have been going to Foster City Dental Care and I have met all the staff.

They are all professional and extremely friendly. I definitely recommend this office to everyone.< /review>

<text>Gypsee is fantastic!   The best Dental Hygienist I've ever seen.  She is very caring, listens to your concerns and makes sure you are comfortable throughout the visit. The front desk staff is also very friendly.  Today I saw Preethi Poulose,
D.D.S and she was also great and professional.    Shirin S. Imani,
D.D.S. is also great!<//text>< Gmap_id>

My dog's long term vet recently retired from another facility and the new Vet's that took over are terrible so I was forced to find another Vet. My friend recommended Aborn. It was an excellent experience and they had caring staff. It was easy to get an appointment, and they treated us with compassion and respect. I highly recommend them.</Text>

Kiwi had her first visit today and wow, the service here is GREAT. Almost ALL of the vets I’ve been to were really rude or even too busy to explain in detail what exactly is going on. The staff here was great. They listened and were very patient with us. I look forward to having more visits here for kiwi and would highly recommend!< /review>

<review>I cannot thank Aborn Pet Hospital and its staff enough. My beagle Darwin has always been a sick dog. He has suffered from various medical conditions, including cancer, from a very young age. We were loyal to our primary vet, who seemed to "treat" him when needed, but I never felt like they truly tried to get to the root of his problems, or offer a long term treatment/preventative plan.

Our vet retired during the pandemic, and recently, Darwin was having some type of reaction that was causing itchiness and redness throughout his body - he was absolutely miserable. This wasn't the first time it happened, and previously, he would get prescribed prednisone and nothing more. It worked short term - but it would happen again. I wasn't able to get into the vet I usually went to, and after calling 10 vets that were too busy and turned me away, I called Aborn.

The woman on the phone was very friendly and was quick to get Darwin an appointment. I got seen the same day and instead of giving him a steroid and sending us on our way, they suggested Darwin get an allergy panel - which we obliged. Three injections, and two allergy panels later, we were hopeful we would get answers. Darwin was already feeling better by the next day and made a full recovery within two days. When we finally got his test results back, everything started to make sense. He is allergic to so many things that he is often exposed to. We now have the tools necessary to treat Darwin accordingly, and I am happy that he was given the care he deserves.

Aborn Pet Hospital brought so much relief to my family and I am very grateful for their services.</review><resp>None< /resp>< Pics>

<Review>My dog started coughing Friday evening.  I called around and no one could squeeze him in.  I knew he had kennel cough.  Aborn was able to see him Tuesday.  We talked over the phone and the person on the phone listened.  That was the first awesome thing they did.  Then when we arrived Tuesday, Rianna came out and again, she listened to my concerns.  She was professional in a fun way and even talked to my dog.  She made me feel way better.  They actually listened to what I thought it was and didn't dismiss me.  I loved that.  After completing the forms, Rianna came back and got my dog out of my car and he's a huge dog.  She brought him in and even though they were busy, she said to leave him and they will call me and not to worry.  They couldn't see  him right away, but offered to kennel him inside until the doctor could see him.  After a couple of hours, I received a phone call from the doctor.  It was, as suspected, respiratory infection due to bacteria.  The doctor talked to me explaining everything and he even added that my dog did well during examination.  He didn't need sedation or was too hard to control because of his size.  They kept him until I could come pick him up.  They sent him home with medication, detailed instructions and a reasonable cost for exam and med's.  The young man who returned my dog to the car and gave me the med's was so nice, professional and polite.  I didn't catch his name.  Aborn is professional, but not overly stuffy.  They make you feel at ease.  I really liked that because I'm freaking out already about my dog.  They are cost conscious, another concern of mine.  Great staff.  Great experience</Review>< Name>

Aborn Pet Hospital is absolutely wonderful and I highly recommend them for all of your pet's needs.  The staff is always courteous and professional and I have never been disappointed with any of their services or products purchased on line.

We have been taking our cats here for many years! We've also taken some feral cats to be spayed/neutered as well. I moved out of the area so I haven't been here in a while, but I recently came back and took my cat for a check up. I have always had a pleasant experience here. The staff is great and super helpful and Dr. Mann is the best! Take your furry friends here and you won't be disappointed.</Text>

<review>My long overdue review for Dr. Mann

My two beloved dogs have been taking care by Dr, Mann since 1997
The 1st one, a lab-chow mix, was an extremely mean dog that allows no one to touch or to be closed
Dr Mann was the only vet in town in providing cares for my mean dog until 15 & half years old
indeed, I were appreciated & never forgot Dr. Mann's tremendous helps.
After few years sad break, I got a chocolate lab recently from my son on father's day.
Yes, certainly, my lovely chocolate is now under Dr. Mean's health cares & my spoiling ...

That finding a reliable veterinarian is never an easy task
Look no further; Dr. Mann & his team is the one</review>< pics>

He was obviously not familiar with our dogs records, our appointment needs or the manner in which his colleague had noted our dog needed to be approached. When asked about the errors in the clinic he first blamed his staff and then us for his lack of communication between vets in the clinic. I would go to absolutely any vet rather than be subjected to him again.  Please rethink your options before supporting this man.< /text>< Pics>

Front staff very nice. I didnt like, after my dogs test result came in, I received a call from Dr stating Bella had high liver enzymes and needed a prescription  90$. to help the liver. So after picking up the med . I noticed it wa an over the counter liver supplement, not an actual prescription med. I was not informed of this. I would have liked to have had the choice to buy it from the vet or pick it up for 1/2 the price somewhere else. I was also charged for a difficult dog nail cut which cost me aprox 50$ (cant remember actual amt) but was told  that she did really good with her nails. Not sure what that was about. Hubby took her in so he went with the flow on the bill. I did call vet about my concerns but haven't received a response.</text>

I thought they were a good vet until my aunt started telling me all the things included in the exams at Banfield Hospital and how they really look over the pets, Aborn exams are extremely basic for the cost and not worth it.
One of my cats got sick in November and a doctor, i believe Dr. Gail, at Aborn Hospital told me to go to the emergency vet (Beacon Emergency Vet) immediately, so I did. Once there it took Aborn a full day to transmit the history to the emergency vet so they can actually start working on my cat. I had to pay for that full day of my cat being there even though they were just waiting for Aborn to give them the details of what was already done. After Beacon finally got the information from Aborn they made me pay to redo all the same tests because they said the tests from Aborn were not conclusive enough. In the end i paid $4,500 and turns out the cat was just constipated! After this i got another cat, asked Aborn to send me quotes for all the shots, spay and microchip and they never sent it, every time i call or email for information to be sent they NEVER send it! I finally decided to use a new vet, i emailed Aborn multiple times for the history reports so i can give to the new vet and they never responded. I tried calling multiple times for a week and it went straight to voicemail and the box was full so i could not even leave a message. I finally decided to just go in and get the hard copies but due to COVID-19 they are not allowing people inside, i again tried to call and again NO ANSWER, i stood at the door for 30 minutes waving at the receptionist and she waived back at me but wouldn't come answer the door! Finally another employee came out to help me and then REFUSED to print my history reports stating they were over 200 pages long, that sounds impossible to me. She said she would email them immediately, after 3 days I still didn't receive them and decided to call again. I had to practically yell at the person on the phone to get them to email me the reports and once received they were only 17 pages long, not 200 like i was told. They are LIARS and just take your money. Don't trust them and DONT take your pets here. I would recommend Banfield Hospital, they actually CARE about the animals!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< userid>

Highly recommend Aborn Hospital. The staff is courteous and understanding. Doctors are knowledgeable and trustworthy. Have been taking my pet dog there for over 2 years now. Have nothing but good things to say about them. Last time, the doctor saved me money by recommending that I buy some products from Amazon instead of buying from them because it's cheaper. Haven't seen or heard anyone else do that.<//Text>

I am grateful I found Aborn Pet Hospital in Fremont where my precious pets receive the best of care. Dr. Mann is not only very thorough with examinations, but offers preventive care options for your pets.   His staff is welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable too. I love the online pet store and receiving electronic medical results online.  Hard to find veterinarian services that will give your cat a bath!   A picture is worth one thousand words! :)< /review>

My overall experience was pleasant but it was only one of the vet techs that really went above and beyond for me. He gave me a lot of great recommendations and advice on the wealth fare of my pet rat. I will be happy to visit again if my baby ever needs help.

Had my cat put down there paid way over what a cost should be to be buried with other cats. Found out where they sent her ashes don’t even have a receipt of getting her no proof they ever buried her. The thing is they threw her ashes at a mountain I’ll never be able to visit her. I miss my cat so much very sad I went there.<//Text>

Dr Mann and his staff have cared for our Lhasa Apsos, Dash and Sprint, for 14.5 years. They've cared for our pets as much as we care for them and we're obsessed with taking care of our two kids with four paws.

Today was particularly hard because we had to put Sprint to sleep due to old age. Unlike a middle of the night emergency vet visit 16 years ago with our former dog, this time Dr Mann and Merced came to our home. Sprint went peacefully and Dash was close by so he could adjust hopefully more easily to losing his litter mate and sister.

Aborn staff treat your pets like family. They teach you how to take the best care possible of your pets. They have big hearts. We're grateful for so many years of care for our loved ones.< /Text>

<text>We have received wonderful service here. We did not have to wait for long time. They were very gentle to my cat, My cat was very scare when we were in the clinic. The nurse held her gently and told her she would return to mommy soon then she calmed down. They tried to comfort me too for they knew that I was worry. Thank you for your understanding and your love to our pets.<//text>< username>

Our pet, Lance has been under Dr Mann's care for several years now.  We have the Platinum Wellness plan with Aborn and have been quite satisfied with the services.  The staff are very friendly, and Dr Mann's healing touch has helped Lance tremendously over the years, when we have visited them for routine or unplanned injuries.  They are also very good for Pet boarding when we need to go out of town.
I would highly recommend Aborn to any new pet owner or one wanting to leverage their friendly, caring pet services.  God bless their staff and doctors.<//Review>

The staffs are very friendly and understanding. I've walked in panicking because i didn't know what was going on with my dog. The sweet lady patiently listened to my rant and offered a solution to help get him, and he was treated immediately that day.  They are very good at fallowing up timely. My dogs are doing great.<//Text>

Thank you for the kindness shown to myself and my husband the day we brought Molly in. Molly was a member of our family for 13 years and all of you helped us through a difficult time. Your thoughtfulness shown to us was greatly appreciated. Thank you.</Text>

<Review>I want to thank Dr. Mann and his great staff at Aborn Pet Hospital. The go above and beyond to help Rescue Groups and their Animals. We all know that not all our animals can be saved or protected from the illness's that can be contracted at shelters and poor living conditions. However, Dr. Mann and his staff do everything possible to save their lives.  I have been in Rescue for 18 years and am happy to trust Aborn Pet Hospital with my own pets as well as my rescue fosters. With the hundreds of rescue animals that Aborn Pet Hospital has seen, very few are lost. Thank You Aborn Pet Hospital for all that you do for Rescue.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Text>Dr. Mann and all the staff at Aborn Pet Hospital are very professional, caring, and compassionate. I could not have had a more professional, kinder vet for my two cats Furby and Grumby, who are no longer with us but at the Rainbow Bridge. For six years after I moved to Sunnyvale, I returned to Dr. Mann and the staff of Aborn Pet Hospital to take care of my beloved cats. I do not hesitate to recommend them enthusiastically and most highly. Thank you!<//Text><Name>Linda Devendorf</Name>< resp>

<review>Our lab has been seeing Dr. Mann since her 8 week check up!  The staff is great and helps with any and all questions. They even do walk in nail clipping. Their service is top of the line!  Aborn offers on-line access to all your pets medical and shot records that has been very helpful for quick info.  We were offered 1 month of Trupanion puppy insurance as a trial, which was great since labs tend to have issues. We kept the insurance since the payments were low and everything is covered, since she was just a puppy.  As it turned out she did have elbow issues and Dr. Mann refereed us to a surgeon that was also amazing!
THANK YOU ABORN for everything!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I am a business partner in a dog training business and my partner and take our personal dog to Aborne and highly recommend them to our clients.   I have received numerous comments and thanks for recommending Dr.Mann and his staff.

I have been taking our dogs to Aborne for years and I have always been impressed with Dr. Mann's skills,  knowledge,  and his compassion for the animals and the owners.   I have also been impressed with the fact that they may give you recommendations on treatment options,  they never try to over sell you.  I also love their wellness plans, it really helps off set the rising cost of veterinary services.   ACI loves you guy's!

<Text>I've been a loyal ulta beauty customer for about 6 years now and there's 6 other locations I go to and though the associates are polite & helpful at other locations, this location had by far the most helpful and polite associates, even down to the security, I overheard him telling another woman of the sales going on. I think this might be my favorite ulta I've been to, they carry every brand here, the only other location that carries mac is my pico rivera location but I feel this store is bigger and more well stocked. I came here last night (12/11/20) & everyone was so nice & extra helpful<//Text>< pictures>

<review>Just left this store at 1:30 pm on a Monday. Next week is Thanksgiving. Came in looking for the gift sets that were in the mailer that came in my mail. Walked back by the salon to look at the gift towers for Dermatologica,  Strivectin & Dr Peppicone gift sets. I walked all over the are for 20 minutes and no one approached me at all??? Are these girls on commission? If so, they will starve this holiday season!!
The store was well staffed for the 4 customers (myself included) in the store.   This was the same experience I had in this store this summer so with the holidays, I thought I would try again. Some things do not change!!  The Pier1 store that previously occupied this storefront was always welcoming and helpful,  nothing like this service less cash receptacle!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< gmapID>

Jackie, the woman at the counter, was willing to have me walk out and leave $60 worth of product behind because I didnt want to give her my phone number. What is Ulta's priorities? She also wouldn't give me her manager's name. Frustrating. What happened to the days of just buying something you want, without being harassed?</Review>< name>

<Text>Undeniably this store's sales associates and cashiers are the most helpful and professional; this used to be my only goto ULTA store. However, I had the worst shopping experience this past Friday. Initially we had some trouble with POS system; it would either not letting us to add on the appropriate items, or wouldn't read my credit card for at least three times. In the midst of all the troubles, this manager came up, he DID NOT try to help, but told the cashier to use the same cash register and help the next customer in line. Forcing the sales associate and I to the side while system problem persisted with their hand held POS device. The fact was, the other cashier has already started to bag items purchased by the customer she's helping with at the time, and there was only one person waiting in line. I happened to be the only Asian customer in the checkout process. This manager never apologized, and left me felt like I was being discriminated because I am Asian! ULTA, please! You have opened a store in a predominantly high income Asian community, and your manager discriminates Asian people! In my humble opinion, no one should discriminate anyone, and we all need be considerated of each other!
You've left me with no other choices but to file a formal complaint to the ULTA corporate office.
I would NOT shop at ULTA again unless you put your acts together!<//Text>< Pics>

<user_name>Princess M</user_name><review>The management and employees here are inexperienced and bad attitude problem. Inconsiderate of customers and handling of emergency situations.  I came to the store door 5 minute before closing, they had already locked the door. WHY WOULD YOUR STORE CLOSE ON 6PM ON SUNDAY, AS OTHER STORES CLOSE LATER?  AND MANY CUSTOMERS STILL COMING AFTER ME. As i was only trying to return an item, not trying to buy anything, i wanted to talk to someone. All of the employees 3 girls , standing very close to the door, just chatting, ignoring me and other customers outside the door. The knew we were there, they just pretended we didnt exist.! I finally bang on the door and request to be acknowledged and helped, the heartless girls were still standing there just looking at me. Really? Is this how you treat a customer who just spend over $200,  2 days ago?  You dont even bother to come and talk to a customer just because you want to go home early?  Then one of the girls called the manager to cone, she just stands with others ,back facing me for another 10 minutes. At this point, i just wanted to stay to see how bad it could be so i can write this review.  I bang on the door again, the manager finally could not ignore me and came to the door. I had to force her to open the door to speak to me like a real human being.  She just told me without letting me speak, that she cannot let anyone in after 6pm. Yes, i was here before 6, and you locked the door early, and let me stand out here for 15 minutes until i can talk to you, of course its after 6 now.  Ulta, with this kind of attitude and "heart" , its not going to get you far in business and in thid neighborhood!  Words will get around.  Lets see how long this kind of service will last!< /review>< rate>

(Translated by Google) They should have more staff that speak Spanish, not everyone is bilingual, I don't like that store, I prefer which one I want another ulta 😏

(Original)

<Review>Horrible! It was much better back in the day when they had people actually hand scrubbing your car when driving through the wash section. Now, they updated it, so it's as if you are driving through a $6 gas station car wash only paying 6x the amount. And don't even get me started on the people who dry the car. What a joke! I'll be doing my own washes from now on, thank you very much!!!< /Review><Rate>1<//Rate></record></dataset><record>
<review>1st time here,  considering the neglected condition my truck was in, and it's age they did a pretty good job.  It's not cheap, but these people work really hard and it was over 100 degrees outside on this particular day.  They did miss a few things like dusting my dash, but they did a great job hand waxing the entire truck and breathed some life back into the paint. Apartment life is not great for my vehicles as I can't just wash them whenever I want,  this is a nice option and saved me from getting heat stroke😉</review><rating>4<//rating><resp>None<//resp>< user_name>

Completely disappointed. We got the works which includes vacuum but they did not vacuum under the seats. We can still see dusts on our dashboard. The interior was not cleaned well. Some of the coffee stains on the cup holder and door were not even removed. We got the works, NOT the basic So we paid more and expected better result. We'll never use this carwash. I could have washed our car myself. Not worth your $30.</text>

Professional, clean and exceptional customer service. They offered a hand wax special for a few dollars more but my time was short. Brentwood has a hidden gem.< /Text>

<Review>Lots of options available for car wash, choose wisely otherwise you pay more for somewhat less service. It is better carwash in Brentwood but doesn’t worth for five star rating.</Review>< Gmap_id>

It was good. It's definitely alittle pricey! For the price you pay you wouldn't think you have to remind them to go over certain area's on your car when service is complete. My driver side mirror was dirty & around the bottom of door panels we're dirty & needed more wiping down as we'll as door panel's!< /Text>

<text>Should change the name. NOT HAND WASH anymore. Maybe cause of covid but was a mediocre wash before, now it's even lower quality with a weird lame automated washing system that doesn't wash very well. Liked it better when they did it by hand.</text>< Pictures>

I paid $40 for nothing .windows still dirty outside on windshield . Didn't wipe anything down it was still as it was when I brought it in I'm disabled so I can't clean car myself as good as I would really want too . I'm super dissatisfied and disappointed in this place . Save your money and time pay a friend or family member instead. I'm upset that my car is still dirty and I don't even use the car much but I live in country with dirt road and wish I could have been happy with results any recommendations anyone< /Text>

<Text>Spent 70$ with tip for car wash, and still had water spots on windows that the so called manager said they were not able to clean....got home and was able to get them out in less then 10 minutes with FULL strength window cleaner...they still charge full price but hand washing is not available amongst other things on your package that you pay for...I understand the covid 19 restrictions but at least do the things you are able to do professionally! And by the way there were only 2 vehicles there including me, so busy is not an excuse....I call it a money grab! Buyer beware< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Not sure what some of the complaints are about, if you see a long line of course it will take awhile but they have it as streamlined as possible given that it's a hand wash and not a pure drive thru like at a gas station< /Text>

My father-in-law uses the Brentwoid hand Car weekly. When we came to town after driving down for a visit from Washington State our vehicle needed a wash. We are particular about our vehicles. Brentwoods Handwash did a stellar job, i wish they had  facility in Washington.<//review>

Been going for years. Always double check your vehicle, especially the front & rear windows before you leave. As soon as you drive from under the covered parking you will be able to see better.</review>

I paid $42.00 that’s with tip.  My kids could have washed my car, left my car looking the same or better and the profit would have been worth it!  I can’t believe this town has NO descent car wash.  The machines wash better.  Waste waste of money!< /Review>

They did a pretty good job cleaning my car. There were a few spots that they missed. The wheels could have been cleaned better. Windows were left streaky. The price was too expensive for the job they did. They were very busy today when I went.</review>

Paid 35 bucks for what I wanted and they left all the mosquitos on the grill and part on the hood. They left mosquitos on the windshield along with all these water spots. I bought this car a week ago and its fairly new. Don't understand where quality control is at? I should have washed my car at home instead. This is not being picky, its getting what I paid for, on top of that I always pay tips. From the beginning of the wash, the guys in the tunnel literally don't seem to want to work at all, they let so much time with the car rolling that they completely missed the bumper area and the hood, not to mention the windshield, and were extremely slow. I could have gotten back to get my car washed again, but instead I'm not going there again. Not worth my trip  from far away. When I worked there many years ago, they had me running in the tunnel and I was fast. Now I go back to get my car washed and I just threw away 35 bucks for nothing.</review>

Luckily I bought this on groupon because if would have paid $40 for what I received I would have asked to speak to a manager. I mean door jams were NOT touched, interior was poorly done, windows had smears and if I didn't ask for my fragrance I wouldn't have gotten it. Disappointed.</review>

Aside from the damage, the clean was terrible as well. Pay the 5 year old on your street $5 and that’s about what kind of job you can expect to have done here.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808ffe9a50695f8d:0x6103b1fd81122a00</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This place is packed! I brought one of my car to have it full detail, clay and sealant applied. It took them about 3 1/2 hours for the work but boy the car looked brand new!

Their prices are inline with other but their menu can be a bit confusing and I couldn't find the right package for what I want.  Fortunately Jose (the Assistant Manager) helped me customized something. Of course I was skeptical but Jose reassured me this was what he recommended. While the car was there, he would frequently walked to my car and spoke to the guy doing the detail and then come to me giving me an update. Not only to me, but other people waiting for their cars too.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>Missed a ton of spots, and I mean a ton.  No reason to not wipe down the doors and the seats.  I found leaves, dirt and hair all over my vehicle.  The tires and rims were half as*ed as a result there is dirt and brake dust all over.  I even went first thing in the morning so there is no need for these people to be tired.  What a waste of money.  I will not be coming back.</Review>< gmapID>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Worst service ever. I paid $54, to get extra cleaning. They "cleaned" my car so fast, that there were still stains on the seats. I used baby wipes to clean it. Also, they parked my BMW somewhere to the side, with my car keys on the front tire!! I guess they really don't give a s***t if someone steals our car. So, basically what they do is, they park your car somewhere to the side, and they place your car keys on top of the front tire on the driver's side. Then, they leave your car unattended, and you're on your own. By the way, you can barely see your unattended, parked off to to the side car, from the waiting room. You have to go outside. They didn't even bother coming inside the waiting room to let me know that my car was "ready." Don't pay more than $25 if you come here. They will still treat your car and the customer the same. Paying more to them doesn't make a difference here.
I will never come back here again!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

No cleaning well. I was there few times and I always find dust on the dashboard, shoes dirt on the back of the seats and some kids snacks history. The good news is that the line is fast and there are enough stuff.</Review>

$29.00 I can live with if done right. Done with my car, and I pointed out marks on windows and trim from sprinkler water. Said I would have to pay more to get that done, and directed me to the booth where u pay. Really? Stopped at auto parts, got a cleaner and rags for $14.00 more, and did it myself. I will never go back there.< /Review>

Service has really gone down. Twice now I have brought my truck and wife’s car in for full interior detail with conditioner and everything. First time, young kid refused to wipe down door jambs and had an attitude about It. Today they did nothing more than a wipe down and vacuum. Had to buy armor all wipes and do It myself before picking kids up from school. I’ve been going there for years, this will be our last time.<//text>

I really don’t know what I paid $40 for. I paid for a wax in my package and didn’t receive it, I’m not a dirty person at all but I have bottle caps from water bottles and a couple gum wrappers on the floor, which I understand I can pick up myself but I paid you to clean my car. Wipe my car down and vacuum it. Wipe my seats down.... also didn’t happen. I even tipped you and drove off. I will NOT be going back.< /review>

I went yesterday for the works plus and asked them to wipe down the seats and they charged an extra $5 so I paid $35. Which is fine if they did a good job but they literally didn't touch the center console. I left my trunk open to vacuum and when I got home and opened they didn't even vacuum in there! Needless to say I refuse to go back there, I've given them too many chances.< /review><rating>1< /rating>< Response>

<Review>Ok I am pissed! I just sent my daughter down to have my new Tahoe washed. I stayed on speaker phone when she paid and she did the $25 max wash which the gal said full exterior wash and interior vacuum and wipe down. At end of wash, my daughter sent me photos. NOTHING was wiped down on the interior! I called and spoke to the manager and explained and requested for the crew to go back through with a wet cloth to wipe down dash, interior side doors, and console. The manager argued and said if I pay $45 more, they would do that. This place is a scam! Unprofessional management and absolutely not for customer service! They took advantage of a young girl, misrepresented their service and refused to accommodate an unsatisfied customer. Brentwood hand car wash can suck it! They will never have my business again! The owner needs to be on site and evaluate the employees especially the manager! This place is a joke!!!<//Review>< user_name>

Had the hand wax coupon. First attendant didn't know what it was. Second one took it but kept telling me how detrimental it was to my car. The wax job was ok, performed with a machine NOT hand waxed. My biggest complaint is that they are unbelievably slow. Took an hour 45 for a simple wax-no interior. There must be a better choice somewhere in Brentwood< /review>

Horrible job! Just went there with two of my vehicles and ordered the works plus and feel like I was the one worked over! Right off there was a lack of communication as to where to direct your car and where to go. Next was the unenthusiastic feel of the whole place and it looked like everyone was so unhappy and you just knew it was going to be a spotty job at best.  Both cars were not cleaned properly and I will not be coming back.< /Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><rating>1</rating><review>I URGE EVERYONE TO PLEASE READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE COMING HERE!!!!  I wish I read the reviews before visiting because the general consensus is absolutely correct.  The detailing service I received for my $120 was sub-par.  A simple leather detail, wash, shampooing of my floor mats turned into an overly oiled down car with shampoo doused mats (no scrubbing) and no interior cleaning.  I ended up going home and having to clean the interior myself as well as have my husband clean the mats.  Interestingly enough the dirt on the mats seemed to be worse than when we went in not to mention the putrid smell of wet dog left on the interior after the "shampooing" they said they did.  When we removed the mats to clean them at home and simply sprayed them with water you saw nothing but suds coming off the mats as though the shampoo was just left to sit on them.  Using our deck broom and little elbow grease the nasty patches of dirt that were left easily came off. Long story short I hope someone else reads these reviews and doesn't waste their hard-earned money.  I also hope the owners of this establishment invest some time reading these reviews as well because at the end of the day your business is supposed to be there to serve a purpose and benefit customers not simply take their money and perform substandard amenities.<//review>< UserId.>

Complete garbage customer service. I came to the car wash with my motorcycle at 5:20 and they wouldn’t even spray by bike down after I told id pay for it. She told me to go down the street to another self service place. Wasn’t even anything down where she sent me. Completely unacceptable considering it wasn’t even busy.< /Review>

Another disappointing car wash. I've been going to them for years, and the quality has been going down for a long time. After the car wash, I found dirt on my car and they did not wipe down my center console. When you pay almost $30 for a car wash, you expect better service. I also have to clean my windshield myself. It is more dirty than when I pulled in. I will be going to the other car wash in brentwood from now on. This place has become horrible.< /Text>

<text>I've been hearing how terrible they were, but had my car wash this morning. What I heard was correct. Did a terrible job washing the car ( hand wash), wiping down the car, smeared the windows, no attention to detail. The owner if concerned should speak to everyone on today's shift. Not a good business model. Will never go back.</text>< Time>

Horrible.....After wash,got home 10 mins later,looked as if it had rained and I had driven through mud puddles...I have always had to wipe the waterspots wen I get home....This is the last straw...Took my new Sonata for a wash on sat morning,9-3-16....could not believe what I saw....dried spots all over....enough is enough...If I pay to have it washed there is no way I should have to go over it 10 mins later...I WILL NEVER BRING ANY OF MY CARS TO YOUR BUSINESS AGAIN....</review>

<text>I don't know about you, but when I pay $30 for a car wash I expect my car to be clean. Even if you use a coupon, you should still get a clean car. Today my car had dirt all over the back, the sides, under the door handles, and around the bottom. I had to ask someone to wipe those down not once, or twice, but three times to get my car cleaned. This'll be my last trip to this carwash.<//text>< user_id>

Every other search goes to Google Ad Service. I don't own a business, so I don't have Google Ads. I am trying to write to Google about a television advertisement during the Steelers - Titans football game. My first question while the ad was running was "What is Nesdoddeo?" The voice over throughout the ad was saying what sounded like "Nesdoddeo", or "Nesdoddio". All onewordrunningtogether. It wasn't until the commercial was ending that the actual product name was shown, Nest Audio. So if someone was not in front of the television during this commercial, they would have no idea what this product was. No one reviews / previews television ads?</text>< pictures>

<Text>Since 2 1/2 my son has wanted to work for Google.  We spend summers in Oc with family. So, I wanted to surprise him and take him on a tour. Dream crusher only big crowds of kids accepted via school.  No support homeschooled kids during summer.<//Text><Time>1562103833317< /Time>< user_id>

Very nice Google location, but Chicago, Mountain View, and London are better. The Google employees here are amazingly accommodating and helpful. All questions are welcomed and answered honestly. There are nice views of Irvine off of the back balcony.</text>

Great until you need help with Gmail and their lack of technical support.  I guess if you have any important documents or needed updates you'll just have to check your spam folder!  Thanks google.< /text>

I went there seeking help and information about setting up an email account for my son but apparently they don't welcome customers.  The guy just tells you to go on the website and search.  I'm deaf and there's a big inconvenience to call... Also, I drove all the way to the company and paid for parking.  It's a waste.  Microsoft has stores that I can go individually and ask questions.  They are far more helpful.  Google just send you to a website and then they have this automated lists for you to search for issues... Hopefully to solve your problem.  It's awful, impersonal service.  I felt neglected.  Yes, there's a Google number to call but whats the point in calling as a deaf person?  Wish they provide an online chat support.</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>(Translated by Google) Is it true that every Google is dizzy like a maze? The stairwell is divided into two parts. The central transparent canopy escalator is equipped with an ambient light, which is a magical future. It can be directly connected to the main restaurant.
The dishes in the main restaurant change every day, and the level is up and down, but the variety of vegetables and fruits is enough to easily meet the daily needs.

I really like the downstairs landscape, the small circular space, the trimmed lawn, California's unnamed desert plants, trails, and a tree planting. The location seems to have been specially considered, and the shade can cover the bench. Sitting here is very comfortable.

是不是每家谷歌都像迷宫一样令人头暈，這裡的樓梯間分成兩部分，中央的透明頂蓬手扶梯配上氛圍燈，有點魔幻未來的感覺，可以從這裡直達主餐廳。
主餐廳的菜品每天都會變化，水平忽上忽下，不過蔬菜水果種類豐富，絕對可以輕鬆滿足每日所需營養。

我非常喜歡樓下的景觀部分，圓形小空間，被修剪齊整的草坪、加州未名特有沙漠植物、小徑包圍，點植一棵喬木，位置似乎經過特別考慮，樹蔭可以覆蓋長椅，坐在這非常愜意。< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Name>Ferdinand Beachum</Name><Text>This is genuinely one of my favorite dishes in LA. It's consistently delicious, packed with flavor, both sweet & savory rolled into one beautiful bowl. You HAVE to add the cheese, if you go with somebody who is lactose intolerant, don't go with them. You must add the cheese, it's incredible. There's generally a wait but I've never waited longer than 20 minutes and its worth it anyway.<//Text>< response>

<Review>Ordered their signature galbi jjim with cheese on top and rice cakes.  The cheese and rice cakes are extra charge.  They also charge for rice.  Can't imagine eating this without rice.  Definitely meant for 3-4 ppl. The meat was fall off the bone and there was plenty of meat off the bone as well.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<gmapID>0x80c2b582ba7a94bf:0xbd6105a8c4e125b3< /gmapID><review>This restaurant is a simple place. You wouldn't think of it as a very famous or popular restaurant. However, the food is really good, the kind of food you would hope to eat from a Korean home. The Sul Lang Tang soup is a very very popular dish among Koreans, similar to how Pho is for the Vietnamese.  It's a good place for other traditional Korean food.< /review><user>112485034789413782703< /user><Date>1488670824814<//Date></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Restroom:  one single stall, all genders.

Food:  Delicious!  One of my favorite places for duk mandu guk.  They change up their yummy banchan throughout the week.

Man oh man...what a gem! You know the food will be tasty just by its banchan. Then side dishes don't lie....they were probably the best I've had outside of Korea. Ordered the samgyetang (seasoned) and sullungtang (unseasoned). Seriously brought me back to the harsh winters of Korea. So nourishing and satisfying. If you are around the LAX and want to skip the traffic/lineup to Koreatown, check out this spot in Gardena. Chinja massiseoyo!<//review>

<review>My friends and I wanted some good korean food and went here for sul lung tang (mixed beef soup) and samgetang (whole chicken soup). Service was sweet and bomb and the layout is very traditional korean style. Their side dishes were sooo good. We especially asked more of the spicy pickled radish cause it went so well with our soups. Friends loved it and I want to go back to try the sul lung tang.<//review></record></dataset><record>
<text>Great food okay price . Place is very small so order out and enjoy at home. The service might seem unfriendly to none Koreans. But they're  old school Koreans so no small talk don't get offended.  Customer services means get your food as quick as possible and maybe a smile. They might have a distressed look on there face while taking your order but trust me it isn't you they're stressing on something else. Food is AWESOME . Rice and side orders complimentary with most soups.  And the Kim chee is on point. I've only had soups but there noodles look good I'm gonna try it this week . FYI :  before you leave grab a menu so you can order on the phone next time and have it ready when you get there.<//text>< rating>

The Sul Lang Tang Soup was just what i needed as i was feeling body aches, chills and an onset of a fever.

This is my new go-to Sul Lang Tang place. The broth is delicious: milky-color flavored with the bones that have been stewing for hours. the service is great! They also give a variety of banchan.

I don't want to share this gem because i don't want there to be a wait the next time i go -- but i do wish for others to know how good the food tastes here.

There is a parking lot but often times -- it is crowded. Thank goodness it is not LA and there is ample parking on the street as well.</text>

<Review>The best sul lang ting comes with rice and a lot of pan chans ( korean side dishes) . Its quick feat price and authentic. Tastes like homemade "real" korean food.   They mostly speak Korean but just ask them for a menu. All the meals have a Photos you can see what you're buying.  Highly recommended you can order by phone and then pick up parking is not badd but not great. The restaurant itself is very small and not fancy very casual.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

<review>가디나에서 손꼽을 수 있는 맛있는 한식집!!!!!
곱창전골, 감자탕 다 너무 맛있었고 오늘먹은 물냉, 비냉도 맛있었음!! 근데 비냉은 양념이 특이했음!
반찬도 정갈하게 주시고 깔끔하게 잘먹었습니다!< /review>< Pictures>

If the price went up, tell me in advance, or eat a bowl of Seolleongtang and get $ 17.50

<review>I literally spent the rest of my money on a round trip lyft to your store to pick up my amazon delivery... Arrived at 11:38pm only to find the store closed... Google maps and Amazons information state your store closes at Midnight ... I am visiting from New York City and do not drive... I now have no funds to make a second round trip in a Lyft or Uber nor do I have the item from Amazon... Please update your store hours across all platforms... You are doing a disservice to all your customers who rely on accurate information to make informed decisions.... Some people truly don't have the means to just try again another day (as is the case with me).…

P.S: I called the store multiple times prior to booking a Lyft and no one answered... if  information is not regularly updated please at least answer your business phone.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2d1ce9d04d929:0x35dd42147a69ef78< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Balcolm's is the long standing neighborhood markets for residents of Montebello - Northside & Southside.   They do a great job to keep items selling . Reasonably priced.</review>

But the mini pastries I got were not as good. The whipped cream tasted like 99 cent cheap frosting. The tiramisu tasted was too bitter, and the cheesecake was bland, the pecan tart was the best one of the 3 I bought, but that isn't saying much. I'd definitely give them a second chance though, to see if their coffee is as good as their hot chocolate...and maybe take a chance on the carrot cake, I heard it's one of their best sellers.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c662b87a7671:0xb263f0fe817dd254< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great Customer Service! They will answer any questions you have, yummy pastries on shelf ready, but for best tasting cake or fruit tart order a day before with time. The Ice Coffee here is amazing, so is the chocolate croissant, and thr muffins are just splendid. I would totally come back and leave tip. Keep it up LA Baking!< /Text>

This place is nice! They have awesome pastries with coffee and free WiFi. Definitely better than Starbucks or other mainstream coffee stores.
The prices are good and there is barely anyone there if you want a quiet place to work.
There is outdoor sitting, couches and tables.
Highly recommended!</Review>

First of all the Parking is reduced and only allowed to park in specific parking spots. The personal needs more training in customer service and training attitude adjustment. Their shelves need to have various product in them and also have different kinds of coffee including DECAFE!!!!!< /Review>

<user_id>101118346682452853231< /user_id><Text>Today having a long day,I though stop by the bakery to have a nice cup of coffee and a piece of cake one for me and  one for my little boy,So we got there, and the person attending us was not knowing what she has to offer on the individual cakes they have there at the entrance, cause she was new employee, but she was nice and very well manner and respectful, so I actually didn't care  her luck of knowledge, and place my order thinking that either way I suppose it has to be a good cake,So I order  a individual cheese cake,and another that looks some how chocolate mouse,(It wasn't) but i try it was fresh but very sugary and I though to just taking it at home maybe my husband will like it, so i looked at my little boy who basically try  a couple of spoons from his cheese cake,(something he usually finish in seconds) and lets say he was not enjoying it at all, so I ask him if he didn't like the  cheese cake ,he said "no is dry and kind of hard" , so i try it my self ,it really taste like it was from the day before or something, but it wasn't fresh at all, so I ask nicely to one of the attendance who help us if the  cheese cake was fresh cause taste kind of old, and she told me  that she actually didn't know, because she wasn't the one who place them in the morning ,so she ask me if I want to order something else or my money back,and honestly  having trying the  one I have for my self, that  it was fresh but very sugary and the one from my child order was some how dry and like over night ,So i say no its okay  just my money back from the cheese cake, cause as I said i didn't want to create any drama because of that and I was okay taking home  the  one I didn't like, but willing to let  my husband to try, because it was fresh. So she went to the back door where she come with some dollars on her hands, and she lend it to Me very polite, and I took the money but right after she did that, the wife of the owner meaning the owner came and  she was so  mad at me when she approach me, that she was shaking and her breath was cutting so she grab the  piece of cake hold it on her hands and make it pieces, trowing it on the air and then to the trash can,She was furious doing it  like if she was trying to kill some one, so I notice that even the employees look at her like WTH , so I say to her ,well you don't have to do that, and she said "Well either way this is gonna go to the trash or not?...so I try to talk to call her sense and she just walk away from me so desrespectfully saying i don't know what mumbling that everything was made fresh every day or something, treating me  like a piece of crap, something that makes me so mad is the fact that this lady not even respect the fact that i was with my little boy,who saw everything and get scared, so when I saw how she treat me I give the money back to the employee who attend me and i give her back all the cakes and coffee I not even drink it any more and even when I have paid for all of that, I am not willing to let any body treating me like crap, just because  either she has a bad day or simply because she is not emotionally right to be involve in costumer service at all, So I use to order cakes from that bakery for many years for all of our  family events, and even though last time they charge me for fruit that they didn't add to the cake i order and  they never give me that refund when I cal them to let them know, I didn't really make a big deal out of it back then, because at least I was treated with some respect, but now after this episode, I thing Enough is enough and better know the kind of person this  owner is before you put your self in a very humiliating position as it happens to me. Shame on you lady, you should know better  before you treat your customers like crap, so if she did this to me as a customer  who is the one who paid for a product, I don't want to know how she treat at the people who works for her.Any way thats not my deal so If you want some good experience don't go there at all.</Text>< Name>

<Text>Extremely disappointed. I would not recommend them to anyone. My wedding cake was delivered 1hour and 45 mins late. I gave them the address plus directions for the easiest place to parking. They did not follow directions nor  communicated it  to the driver and their excuse was they couldn't find the restaurant. I had to order dessert from the restaurant where my reception was held because I thought they were not going to show up. I didn't hear from them until 1 hour and 30 mins past the closing/ lastest  time scheduled to be delivered. When they finally arrived they did not  bring up the cake as agreed. My Maid of Honor and Best Man brought up the cake and desserts by themselves. I called 4 days after the event and spoke to Rose and she was defensive and took no responsibility, she really didn't care. This's the worst service I ever experienced, horrible service, unprofessional plus caused major distress on my wedding day. Cautious anybody thinking about ordering from here ! ! Do not do it ! ! !</Text>< GmapID>

<time>1399775356828<//time><Review>Ordered: Cheesecake and Tres Leches cake for Mother's Day

Great service and great cakes.  All different kind of pastries to try and too little stomach. I came to pick up a Mother's Day cake and ended up leaving with 2.  The shop has all kinds of cakes (Red Velvet, Tres Leches, Carrot, Chocolate.....) all for a good price.  They added any wording and gave my mother a red rose just because.

Would I drive here just to pick up a cake- Yes less people than Portos, cheaper and great cakes what else do you need. (I do wish they had those potato balls but this is not a Cuban place)< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2c662b87a7671:0xb263f0fe817dd254</GmapID><name>Israel Hernandez<//name>< pics>

<review>(Translated by Google) The last time I placed an order for two cakes there was a confusion with the decoration and the flavor that went with the decoration of the cakes, from there on out everything is very good. The prices agree with the product and it is worth it.

I ordered food for a group for Mother's Day. Food was packed nicely and nothing was missing. Service was great! Everyone liked their meals of chicken, coleslaw, fries, cornbread and peach cobbler. Will definitely return.</review>

<username>Gabriel Rodriguez<//username><Rating>1</Rating><resp>{'time': 1617713150169, 'text': "Hi Gabriel. It sounds like you came by yesterday, April 5 and we were in fact closed to take care of some maintenance items that just cannot be done during business hours and needed to be addressed before covid restrictions are eased altogether. We chose this day because it was the day after a major holiday (Easter) and we expected to be slow. It was also the day that we knew our drive thru would be closed for an unknown length of time our new signs were installed. I posted closure information on our website and on Facebook and on our Google business page.\n\nAlthough there are a few holidays (New Year's Day, Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas) that we do close and other times (New Years Eve, 4th of July, Super Bowl Sunday) that we close early, we do adhere to our posted operating hours.\n\nMonday - Thursday: 11am to 7pm\nFriday: 11am to 8pm\nSunday: 11am to 6pm\n\nI'm sorry for the missed connection. Our goal is to be the best barbecue in the Inland Empire. I've operated for 3 years under the other brand. Hickory Jack's Barbecue is a change to the name only. Our ownership, service team, cook staff and core recipes remain unchanged. I hope we get a chance to see you again."}< /resp>< pics>

Use to love Mill Creek, but since they have changed to Hickory Jacks I was open to trying them. Unfortunately it seems like there hours have changed because everytime I attempt to go they are closed. I have tried to come here 3 times and for some reason they are either closed early or for the day. I grow tired of continually wasting my time to attempt to eat here. I definitely won’t ever be coming here again. When they lost there name as Mill Creek they also lost a customer that recommended them to others.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Great food. The Brisket burger was amazing! The best part is that it doesn't use patty need, but rather real cuts of beef. The fries are well done, not beyond crispy but not soggy either. The cheesy broccoli tasted amazing, but it was hot! Hot as on temperature, not taste, lol.

The potato salad is a bit tarty though, so be warned about that. Definitely wasn't the favored side dish.</text>< Pics>

Came here for the first time since they changed the name. I was not a fan of the Mill Creek and the food is just as bad.
I got a 3 meat plate with 2 sides. The brisket, spare rib, and sausage link were too salty and flavorless. The side of BBQ sauce was thin but didn't taste bad. The mac and cheese was bland. The three cheese potatoes looked disgusting but tasted ok.<//Review>

We ordered a 3-4 person family meal for two adults and a toddler, and it will definitely be enough for dinner for tomorrow, too!  The BBQ chicken, pulled pork, sweet potato fries (sweet honey sort of flavor), and cornbread (with delicious honey butter) were all really good. However, I wasn't a big fan of the onion rings or mac n cheese. We used a restaurant.com $10 off $20 voucher, so it was all a GREAT value for money, basically getting dinner for two adults, two nights in a row, for a total of about $20 ($5 per serving).

We had called ahead to order, and they were ready with our food to-go when we got there. :)</Text>

<text>This place has improved since the last time I came here. They have condensed the menu and the burgers are really good for their price point. I would come here again to try their BBQ. The burger was juicy and the brisket was tender. Also, their BBQ sauce are amazing and they have it spicy but not to spicy. All in all a great place.</text><time>1571026444000</time>< gmap_id>

Sandwiches are wonderful full of great Smokey BBQ meat. But the sides are sparing.we got 4 onion rings for a side, the sweet potato fries were very cold not even warm, the fried onions that are appetizer was a small partion. I'd go back for sandwiches but not the sides or any appetizer. Appetizer was supposed to be for more then 1 person.< /review>

I saw about this on restaurant impossible in India. Since then I wanted to visit here, and during the visit, I got there finally !
Very warm owners with real care about what they feed.
Competitively cheaper than others!!!
Best in service ,I'll be back soon!!!

Great food, competitive prices, good portions. Looking for a sweet and spicy chicken wing? Try the chic sauce. 🔥 Also, the cornbread with the sweet spiced butter is like desert. I love BBQ and this place is DELISH.
*Try the cowboy rito with a side of bbq. Omg. It doesn't matter which meat you choose. They're all fantastic.<//Review>

I placed my order online for pick up and it was indeed ready by the time I arrived. The pulled pork sandwich with tater tots and spicy Bbq sauce is delicious. Must try if you haven't.</text>

<review>Looking for a spot to grab lunch in Redlands, to yelp I go... Mill Creek Bar-B-Q was a pleasant surprise.  My husband and I split a pull pork and fries.  I love the fact that they have different Bar-B-Q sauces that you can apply yourself.  My hubby had to try them all...
The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly.  We got our food in a timely manner.  They also have a drive thru which I thought was interesting.  In all of my years of eating Q I've never seen a restaurant with a drive thru.  Nice touch.
This is someplace that I would revisit, next time trying the ribs or even a burger.
For you drinkers they do offer alcoholic beverages which can only be consumed inside of the the establishment.< /review>< user_id>

My sister came home and shared one smoke Chicken  wing with me I called, ran down from Beaumont to pick up dinner for the entire family. I wanted everyone to taste this deliciousness. I ordered their smoked chicken wings, tri tip nachos, and macaroni and cheese yesterday. It was amazing, today my sister returned home with their wings  for dinner along with their smoke turkey breasts, it was outstanding this place is great I will return and I recommend if you love smoked meat this is the place.</Review>

Been here a few times for lunch. Their bbq is pretty good, albeit not fresh off the grill so it can dry out. The flavor is great, selection is massive, sandwiches are really tasty, meats are all really tasty, a good selection of sauces, and a small victory for me...Diet Mountain dew and Sobe lifewater on tap! Loved the chili and coleslaw, and the biscuit too!</Text>

Food is good. The meat I got on my salad was chewy so I suspect it wasn't cut properly against the grain. Fried pickles were amazing! But only there for a limited time. Prices are fair. Service is great.</review>

Very good food. The menu has been shortened by new owners but food is still just as good. Enjoy the vibe, staff is friendly. They have a drive through and offer family meals. Have yet to tried the family meal but now I know they have it I will be ordering it. Also let me add the salads are amazing.< /review>

We have obviously just changed the brand however the ownership and primary cooking staff are the same people so there really should not be any change to our food. It would be helpful to know what you thought was different so we can look into those items specifically.\n\nI’m sorry for the long wait time. We have brought on some new staff as it appears San Bernardino is moving to a less restrictive covid tier.

<text>Great kids meals, great price. Granddaughter enjoyed her rib and salad.
I had the pulled pork sandwich and potato salad. A little skimpy with the potato salad because it was very tasteful.😊 Pulled pork was very good. They were out of the Turkey so had to order the chicken sandwich which was actually very good.
Although, they clear their tables off in a timely manner, they need to wipe them off with a wet cloth. Our table was a little sticky.
I will return and order a family meal next time.< /text>< Pictures>

Best barbecue ever,1. super fresh pork ribs that dont have even a hint of  that terrible porky aftertaste..2.the ribs have perfect ratio of rib meat to fat content and are super tender and moist 3. Their variety of sauces have a  fresh herb and spices profile that dont taste like processed super market brands 4. their buns are light,airy and delicate that allow all the smoke flavor of the meats to shine5. Their chicken is melt in your mouth delicate and free from any hint of gameiness< /Review>

Amazing barbeque! I had the California Tri-Tip and it was so good! Atmosphere is nice and clean. Fun to experiment with their different barbeque sauces. Also the butter that you put on their cornbread is to die for.</text>

<review>This is a good one fashioned BBQ place that serves home style pulled pork and slice meat BBQ plates and sandwiches.  The meat is delicious, the price is fair, and the portions are nicely sized.  The dining room is clean with a feel of a Texas Roadhouse.  They also have family meals to go for a great price.</review>< Time>

<Text>Looking for a spot to grab lunch in Redlands, to yelp I go... Mill Creek Bar-B-Q was a pleasant surprise.  My husband and I split a pull pork and fries.  I love the fact that they have different Bar-B-Q sauces that you can apply yourself.  My hubby had to try them all...
The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly.  We got our food in a timely manner.  They also have a drive thru which I thought was interesting.  In all of my years of eating Q I've never seen a restaurant with a drive thru.  Nice touch.
This is someplace that I would revisit, next time trying the ribs or even a burger.
For you drinkers they do offer alcoholic beverages which can only be consumed inside of the the establishment.</Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfdX8UpRIzFEVOlbUK3ffCU4iLvsLT4oCZYLP5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPonIx6wosqBt0AJXdzMM6vjmF4f7SC51Ai-a-Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9r6MQl5KblEdcKQLQJx6y3SUNpvDR5rC7x05q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Response>{'time': 1558390279374, 'text': "Thanks so much for your informative review Tish.

<user_id>105077439559499540166<//user_id><Review>Mill Creek was very good to eat... If you have not been there yet, I would recommend the "Tour". The Tour consists of 3 sliders that are built on very buttery pieces of bread and the meats you get are one Tri Tip, one Brisket and one Pulled Pork. Then you get a choice of a side... I got the Sweet Potato Fries and they were very good if you are into that. The BBQ sauce was really good and not too sweet. The staff is very friendly when you walk in, during your stay and even when you leave. I would recommend the place to everyone.<//Review><rating>5</rating><pictures>None<//pictures><date>1549055769140< /date><Gmap_id>0x80dcabaa3b3e4935:0xd582d44bf8f65003< /Gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp><username>Anthony</username></record>

Yummy BBQ and several sauces to slather on your meats! The cheese potato side rocks. I love smoked BBQ chicken and this didn't disappoint... juicy and flavorful. My man enjoyed the slider trio very much. Don't live nearby but if I did would definitely be back.< /text>

<Review>Prices were good for the amount of food!
However the Mac & cheese was terrible, even my 3 and 7 year old refused to eat it.
Everything else was Perfect!!

Good food however, portions are generous  so either be very hungry when you come in or bring a friend to share it. The dining room was clean an orderly. There is outside seating . The wait staff was efficient and courteous. The parking outside is on the smaller side. I would return when I'm in the area.</Text>

I do enjoy this place quite a bit. It's really good BBQ and I know good Texas BBQ. for So Cal this is one of the best BBQ places around and most of the meals are a pretty good value. The sandwiches are large and the sauces are delicious. Pulled pork is fantastic.

It had been remodeled within the year and looks great. If you haven't checked it out you definitely need to add it to your any list and get over there!

John is also great. Keep up the good work.<//Text>

<review>I Love barbecue, and I always have a good experience coming here. It reminds me of when my dad used to grill on the barbecue, perfect moist chicken and sauce that is not too spicy for me. For $10 I can get a quarter chicken, two sides, a corn bread and a drink. That is a good deal in my book. The staff has always been really cool to me.< /review>< Time>

<review>My favorite thing about Mill Creek are the sweet staff, they are full of charisma and smiles, my waitress Hannah even held the door open for my family as we left. My son loves their chicken strips and fries, my Grandma enjoys the chili bowl. Even when they closed they dont make you feel rushed to finish eating so they can go home. The most genuine hospitality I've had in a long time!< /review>< pics>

I mean SATURATED in grease! I ate everything but the bottom bun. When the lady from the front counter came to take our plates, she asked how everything was. I told her nicely and grabbed the bun and was able to squeeze 1/3 cup of grease from the bun... she told me it was the juice. I know the difference between juice from a roast and grease. It was pure grease. My hand was shiny! She told me to order the brisket next time. Not sure if it's worth going back for a greasy bun. It was never like that before.< /Review></record>

The brisket was a little dry. However, the three cheese potato was an excellent side. While the food wasn't bad overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.</text>

We love this place when driving between palm springs and Los angeles.  Fantastic food, great and friendly service. It is very accessible and right off the freeway.  We have had many items here and all are fantastic but the fried pickels are unique and extraordinary.< /review>

My 1st experience did not go too well. I ordered the sloppy pig sandwich (after reading the rave reviews) and a side of mac n cheese. My husband ordered a rib plate with sweet potato frys and onion rings. I requested extra bbq on the side. Our mouths watered all the way home to Moreno Valley. Got home and found no bbq sauce but instead ranch dressing. My husband's ribs were very dry. I ordered regular slaw on my sandwich and got spicy which was VERY spicy. I couldnt find any other toppings on my sandwich (bacon crumbles...etc) maybe they were there but I just couldnt taste them through the spicy slaw. The mac n cheese was very dry and all I could taste was pepper. Needless to say we were very disappointed especially after all the rave reviews we had read.< /Review>

This place is a hidden gem! We stumbled across it on the way to the mountains and were seriously impressed. The staff is nearly as exceptional as the food. 20 years of searching for BBQ in SoCal and this is the hands down winner.</Text>

Dropped by late one afternoon for the first time.  So happy I did!  Love, love, love the food.  Awesome ppl working there, very enthusiastic about what they're serving up there.  And rightly so.  I had the 5 pc beef rib, they were huge, tons of, fall off the bone,  meat.  Huge portions on the sides too.  I chose sweet potato fries and onions rings, both were great.  The ambulance is casual, low key country music pipped in, not too loud, just enough.</review>

Food is BOMB!!! But please cut the tri tip thin, last few times I went it was too thick , and just recently it was thin again. I love it when its cut thinly. Other than that, this place is always a must go to when I'm in the area. Not to mention, it's very cute and country from the inside. I really enjoying having a meal Inside.</review>

Owner was a complete dueschbag. Went in with my daughter and my friend and his daughter. Waiter didn't bring my complete food order. Then I was told I didn't order the food I thought I did. I was fine not eating this fake bbq and let It go. My friend on the other hand went to complain and was greated with a piss poor response from the owner. If this is how they treat retired military I am ashamed for them. Highly recommend investing in better security cameras as the next people you treat this way may not take it so lightly after all your restaurant is in a dump of a neighborhood. Would give it zero stars if it was an option. Most likely family owned as his giant ego suggests. Good luck selling your swill you call BBQ to the unknowing public. Will make sure to let all active and retired military friends know to black list this joint.<//text>

Your friend made it clear that the only solution that would be entertained was for us to provide the missing plate at no charge. While I did think that a discount was in order, and I told him I'd give him a good deal, I did not agree that the mistake was egregious enough to warrant a $15 meal for free. However, your friend left no room for discussion and the conversation deteriorated as he tried to back me into a corner.\n\nAs for military, I have two sons serving - one in Afghanistan and one just finishing his AIT. We also employee veterans. I'm afraid you've missed the mark on our support for active duty soldiers and veterans.\n\nI know your day started off with a disappointing visit to the waterpark across the street and I sincerely wish that we had not made a mistake that only added an exclamation point to your day's frustration."}</Resp>

Good bar be que definitely was pleasantly surprised. The tri-tip and brisket is tender, smoky and well seasoned.  The drive thru can take awhile  but considering its bbq, the wait was tolerable. Overall no complaints a must try if you want some good bbq in the area. Prices are a little high but definitely worth it.< /review>

<review>This reviews for The Mill Creek restaurant off of California Street in Redlands. Not the larger facility in Mentone. Mill Creek is a great little restaurant they have plenty of space to sit down and enjoy the meal there. Food is made to order, it is not a fast food restaurant. It therefore will take a little while longer to get your food, which you should be aware of if you want to go through their drive-thru. But it is worth it! it. The burgers are delicious and brisket is to die for. French fries are Perfection, some of the best I've ever had.<//review><user_name>David Estes< /user_name>< pics>

Counter person talked so fast had to ask about the order twice. Told her twice I'm allergic to onions, order still came with onions. Looked at the order and she did not write down "no onions". Sent order back. Hamburger had very little flavor. My husband rated his ribs as "ok". Not someplace we would return< /review>

I've been searching for a place that rivals in my opinion the trip tip sandwich from Lucille's and man was I not disappointed with Mill Creek! The sandwich on its own with no sauce was great, the smokey flavor came through and the meet was very tasty no need for sauce here but I did any way and it just got better with sweet sauce.</Text>

The kid behind the counter was very very good at what he did, he was enjoyable to deal with and helpful.  He kept the place clean too.  The food however had a bad taste from the beef to the beans nothing was good.  Maybe get the kid to make the food too since he did a great job at everything else.  Get him some decent help in there, you guys werent busy so why was he doing everything, will get his name if we go in again.< /Text>

Had the sliders for under $10. You also get one side.  Had potato salad.  The sliders were all warm and full of tender meat; ready for their bbq sauce which was on the side.  These are a great value and hit the spot.  They have really tasty bbq sauce.  The potato salad wasn't special.  It tasted like store bought.  Had peach cobbler.  We got take out so the ice cream it was served warm with melted by the time we ate it.  It had nice flavor and the crust was tender.  Recommend. Service was friendly.< /review>

Everything about this place is horrible.  Horrible food and horrible service.  Even the presentation of the food when you get it looks bad.  The food is ALWAYS cold by the time you get it.  I've given this place about 3 tries and everytime is worst than the last.  I've only kept going because it's close to my work but I'll never make the mistake of going there again.  I told my coworkers about it and they all knew already because they hate that place too.  They agreed with me and said they also always screwed up their orders. Also the place seems to be run by a bunch of young kids that obviously have horrible work ethics because their customer services is ridiculous.  Never ever again.< /text>

This place is a hidden gem. Big BBQ dishes at good prices.Their rewards program is bomb. Their house salad is my favorite. Their meats are incredible.</Review>

Two of three pork ribs were cold and they all were dry! Meat also tasted old. The prices are too high for it not being fresh.<//Text>

Good food, mellow environment. Everyone was friendly and attentive. Was a little bummed that my order got messed up, but content because what I got was still really good.<//Text>

In addition to the delicious brisket and small town experience, the customer service is excellent. I believe the mature aged man taking drive-thru orders is the owner. He is super awesome, friendly, efficient, welcoming, and genuine. He's the reason I am a frequent customer.< /Text>

Great potential!  Great set up and menu. I give 3 stars because cook is using way too much salt. Even onion rings were salty. Got the piggy sandwich and was needing more juice. FLAVOR IS ON POINT. I've been to BBQ's all over the south and mid west. Just need a little "BAM". Only reason I'm commenting is because your flavor is great, and am tired of driving long distances for good BBQ.</Review>

<name>Bill Randall<//name><review>I have gone in there and from the very first time, the help is horrible.  The help I'm talking about is an older woman, who works weekdays... Obviously shot out from work and must be looking for another career.  Even looks like it is painful to pick up a plate, or take a plate to a table.  She eventually came over to serve me and then splashed my beer all over my hand, and the counter.  The next time in there, the same woman wouldn't even bother to walk over.  Yelled from the other end of the room, what I wanted.  She still didn't get my order, and Albert, the bartender finally got it.  I would love to speak to the manager about her behavior and lazy attitude about things.  I did say something to Albert, who everyone seems to know and constantly butters up to.  He said that it's not her fault that it get's really busy.  Doesn't matter... It wasn't busy at the time I was there.</review>< pics>

Bbq was dry , food came out cold the service was horrible . Girl behind the counter leaning on the register and eating a muffin while taking orders another gentleman out talking with his girl friend sitting down only getting up to hand out orders. Felt like no one was in charge . Poor management . 1 star only beer was cold< /review>

<review>The food was awesome and was very happy with the quality for price especially the onion rings . Bomb! How ever during my visit i used the restroom ...... And this was kinda creepy to me . they have a mirror that is about 12x12 at the hieghth of the top of the sink facin the toliet and unless your height is 2foot8inches tall you will have to bend over to you knees to get a glimpse of yourself. Very very strange. Needless to say. I will eat there again and definitely use the restroom elsewhere.

<Text>How is this the best pico I've ever had in my life? They also gave me straight up half an avacado for an omelet. Tater tots are deep fried, bbq sauce is good, spicy slaw is good. The edges of the place are a little worn. Holes in the furniture, rips in signs, etc, etc. If that matters to you, you may not be happy. But the food is good for a price that is appropriate.<//Text>< Pics>

Tri-tip could have been a little less cooked. It was hard to take a bite without having to saw throug it.  But for the price I guess it was just okay.</Text>

Amazing place to get a bite to eat. There bbq taste amazing. My favorite thing to get is the  chile cheese fries with Tri tip on top with extra bbq sauce I know it sounds weird but it's amazing. There bbq plates are really good to. The staff here is always helpful and the place is super clean.</review>

<text>I love this restaurant & want it to stay open. I'm offering what I deem helpful suggestions.
Because your burger buns are homemade & so delicious you might (at the very least on to go & drive up orders not add the BBQ sauce on the burger). Reason being the is sauces thinkness has changed & it soaks thru the bun & literally falls apart as you eat it. Having it on the side one can add it when tbey start eating.+ please don't pawn cold fries off on the drive thru people.
2ndly I just go a drive thru order about 2 hours ago. I ordered the sliders. They did grill the buns but they were cooled when I got home & they were dry & you could tell not fresh. This is not the 1st time this has happened on a drive thru order at least for me. + the small amount even used for a pork slider, the pork was dry around the edges & just not good. This only happens (again at least for me) on drive thru orders.
I want to say again these are suggestions. The staff is great, friendly. I've eaten here since the opening, volunteered when Robert Irvine came & went & really applaud your success.<//text><user_id>117197077446694567628</user_id><user_name>Tina Coward</user_name><Time>1504998529991< /Time>< pictures>

The quality of the food and service varies dramatically from one day to the next. Coming here is a bit of a gamble.< /review>

< review>
This used to be one of my favorite places. Since original owner left, this place change a lot. Quality is not the same. Burger used to be thick and juicy,  more like home made. Now it looks like a Walmart paty.  I was really disappointed.  Fries are not the same. Chilli cheese fries were soggy.  This place used to be so delicious 5 plus stars, now i prefer Carl's jr😕👎👎👎👎
Update, All the improvement had made on the tech side and those are ok. Trust me, i loved this place, I was to in love with the burgers and briskets meals. But its sad to say, food its not the same as used to be when mom and pop where there. I had been a customer for many years. I wouldn't criticize a place that i love the food. Sometimes all the advertising that you need is quality. I see the difference, not the same. Sorry, but honestly.< /review>

I've worked hard to increase the freshness of all our bar-b-q, especially our spare ribs, tri-tip and brisket. We still continue to press our fresh hamburgers by hand each day and they're served on the same house-made buns. We did make a change to the fries about a year ago, but that was after testing the current style with customers who overwhelmingly thought they were better so again, a move for improved quality. Thanks for sharing. It's clear that we still have work to do."}<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcabaa3b3e4935:0xd582d44bf8f65003< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

OMG, I had a mean craving for  BBQ Tri Tip. I looked up BBQ near me and Voila!  I am sooo glad I picked Mill Creek Cattle Co. in Redlands. They even have a drive thru! Judy and Jim were just the most pleasant and friendly people. Jim was so cute and just full of personality. I am in heaven eating this meal. Best choice and best restaurant BBQ I have EVER  had! Their sides are amazing too.  I got the 3 cheese potatoes and cheesy brocoli. Oh and the corn bread muffin is excellent too!  Please give them a try. You won't regret it. I have found my BBQ Heaven! Thanks Judy & Jim!<//Review>

We decided to get breakfast there because we saw some reviews online and we also read some that stated that they just got remodeled on restaurants impossible. We like that show so we were pretty excited to go there and check it out. Things started out pretty well it was obvious that it was professionally remodeled, and it looked great. When we ordered things started to go downhill. We both ordered breakfast and we are told that they're out of hashbrowns so we had a get tater tots instead. They want to breakfast team one of them actually had hashbrowns and we got them to get us more hashbrowns for the other plate. One dish we ordered was the veggie omelette which was actually pretty good, however the hashbrowns were pretty bland. The other dish we ordered was a breakfast with potatoes eggs and biscuits and gravy, which we're told there out of biscuits then the guy tried to get us to get toast with gravy. Are you serious toast with gravy come on? I ended up getting French toast instead which was pretty bland my eggs were supposed to be over easy they came out more like over medium. While we sat and ate our breakfast we could tell that there were other tables I had issues with their food. Overall we are not really that impressed and don't think will be back for a long time. Chef Robert Irvine along with restaurants impossible was only there two weeks ago and I think someone needs to let him know that he needs to go back and fix this place. The episode is going to air in March 2014, and I hope they get their act together by then or else they're not gonna be able to watch their own show.< /Review>

Food: terrible quality and prep
Staff: defended terrible quality and prep

There's a reason why they have discounts on the food

Pro: they play Christian music..< /Text>
