A lovely shop with an incredible selection.  Inspiring, enchanting (dragons and cats and the most fun photos you could ask for from a bookstore!), with great people who have superb taste in all printed material.</text>

<Review>An amazing journey back in time. Few places like this exist anymore and even fewer with an owner filled with passion about comic books. Worth a visit even if you are not into comics.< /Review>< pics>

<review>The man who works there Saturday and Sundays treats customers like trash. He needs help or whoever runs the business should talk some sense into him for not only lying but also bringing up attitude and insulting me. Been shopping here for almost a year and a half now and he has been the worst aspect of it by far.< /review>< Pictures>

All the current comics and LOTS of graphic novels, digests and manga downstairs...nice selection of vintage/silver age comics upstairs! Stock is well organized and staff were very helpful and knowledgeable. Check 'em out!!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Really awesome spot in the heart of Berkeley! Everything was really well organized and packed to the brim. If you got some time on your hands you could easily lose track of time in this place. Definitely have something for everybody!< /text>

Very helpful, but definitely a Comic Book Guy vibe from some of the employees.  Not a bad thing, but they'll keep talking way after the info is exchanged.  Good selection of new comics and graphic novels.  Would be 5 stars, but the space itself limits.  Very crowded with only 5 customers in the shop.< /Review>

I love getting lost in here...and you will. It's got towers of books, magazines and graphic novels all along it book cases that are filled to the rim with memorabilia and fan boy fun. It's a wonder land for adults...you wonder how they cram all that stuff in there. Plus its SUPER kid friendly with its kids corner for you kiddo to absorb the goodness. Love this place!</Review>

< Review>
I've been going to comic book stores for 40 plus years, I remember the golden days of Comix & Comics (before it was run into the ground).  If anything, The Escapist is even better than those childhood memories.  The selection is fantastic, and the staff even better.  No scary trolls to make you feel like an idiot, the cheery tattooed young lady behind the counter is a delight and also a fellow fan.  Always gracious and willing to help, the one time I had an issue with a misprint they corrected it immediately with apologies.  (And that's really the publisher's fault).

Affiliated with Dark Carnival, just a few doors up, which I'd also check out while you're there, for the best SF bookstore on the planet.< /Review>

good spot for new comic books and graphic novels. they have a huge collection of vintage comics too although the area were they keep it (upstairs) is not always open.</review>
<Pics>None<//Pics><response>{'time': 1522805271773, 'text': 'Hi there! Thanks for the review just wanted to address the vintage section "not always open" we are a very small business and especially on certain days only staff 2 people, so the vintage section always opens at noon. We always want to meet the needs of all our customers and if you have any special requests while you\'re in the store we always hope we can meet them! Thanks so much and we hope to see you again soon!'}<//response><GmapID>0x80857dc8b552d7f7:0xb30648a58c309c6</GmapID></record>

Unfortunately the man at the counter would not sell them to me as they did not have updated price stickers, and he barely looked up from his magazine.

We just got a bunch of new back issues and vintage comics in and since there is only one of me I can only grade so much at a time. If you tell me what titles you were looking at I would be happy to price them for you and work something out.

This dentistry office was very sanitized, the staff were friendly and informative, and the service was professional and efficient.  They also communicate in Spanish, if you prefer.  I initially underwent a deep-clean for my teeth, but the dentist was able to catch the fact that I had 4 cavities and an infected crown.  She went ahead and fixed the cavities, and then prescribed medication for my infected crown, while also recommending a specialist to further diagnose the situation.  FYI, their specialists are in-house, so you wouldn't need to go to another dentistry office.  The amount of care and precision that went into my entire dental visit was exemplary, and the very reason I am writing this Google review for those searching for a trusted, qualified dentist.< /text>

Was in the market for a new dentist that was close to home and would make me feel like I was very well taken care of. Saw this office and noticed it was super close to my house. The attention I received in the office was so friendly and welcoming. As well as the service the staff is great and work fast. Don’t let the speed fool you tho they do amazing work. They take care of the patience and make sure the work is done at 100% or more if possible.

Highly recommend this office for anyone looking for a friendly place. We all know how scary the dentist can be!😅

Did I mention they have multiple specialties in house and no need for back in forth with specialty referrals 🤗<//review>

I absolutely love my new dentist! She has the most easy going hands and is always making sure I am feeling okay throughout the procedure. And the dental assistants are very friendly!
They also have specialists who come in and do specific procedures, that way you don’t have to get referred to another place it’s all in house :) Such as wisdom teeth removal. I just got mine removed here, and let me tell you my surgeon was the sweetest! He was very kind and also great at communicating which is a big deal for me. Love them to bits!</text>

<review>My brother has been going to happy smiles since they opened and I recently have been going myself. He recently started receiving orthodontic work from them and it has been a great experience. The office is easy to find and is in a great location. The staff take their time to ensure that you are receiving the best care. His teeth are looking great and he can’t wait to have his braces off. The staff are very welcoming and make the office feel like home.</review><name>Esteban Sanchez<//name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Happy Smiles is an excellent place for kids and grown ups. Since the 1st day I arrived, they attended me very well with respect and if I had any questions or doubts, they will be more than happy to answer. Stephanie was a great help with any questions I had during or after the process. I will definitely keep coming back and referring my friends & family here.</Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< username>

Happy smiles is a fantastic dental clinic! I was introduced to this clinic by a friend and they had nothing but great things to say about this place. The staff is so kind and welcoming. On top of that, I was brought in quickly and I was in and out of that place in no time. I have never experienced that anywhere in Los Angeles. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a solid service and good vibes. I already recommended this place to my family and friends and they're going to be paying a visit soon! Literally the best dental clinic anyone can go to.<//review>

< Review>
Love this dentistry! I moved to LA a few years ago and was looking for a new local dentist and was very fortunate to find this place. I've been here on multiple occasions from just regular check-ups to teeth whitening and it's been a very pleasant experience each and every visit. The staff members here are very professional and attentive. If you're feeling anxious about a dental visit, don't worry, they'll go above and beyond to make sure you're set in a relaxed and comfortable environment. I definitely recommend this dentistry to anyone looking for just a simple check/clean up to anything major needed for a confident smile! Viva La Happy Smiles!! 😁</Review>

<time>1613428874538</time><Text>Happy Smiles is a very welcoming family practice. Dr. Chiu is an absolute pleasure to have as a dentist. She has such a steady hand and makes you feel unbelievably comfortable, even when the nerves are kicking before getting a filling. I highly recommend Dr. Chiu to anyone looking for a new dentist in LA, she's the best & it's worth the drive if you are coming from out of town. Happy Smiles is affordable & they truly care for each patient, from the front desk, to the big chair in the back. This is my #1 go-to office for my pearly whites!</Text><name>Rob Kellner</name><user>102063551854699065363< /user></record>

I love this place. Never thought I’d find a dental office that makes you feel like family. They are so nice and hygienic especially with this whole virus. The guy in the front is so informative on how my insurance worked.< /Text>

Whatever you do, don't go here. My mom has been going here and they just keep "stealing" money away from her. It's been hard for her to find a good dentist and this place was recommended to her by a friend. From the first visit they are not clear on to what needs to be done. As they schedule you for more appointments additional dental issues arise. Which end up costing you more than what was first mentioned.</Review>

This place leaves me speechless. To start off, the front desk is amazing and help you get through check in quick and easy. Going into my consult my doctor greeted me and was kind, comforting and easy to get along with. The representatives here do an amazing work at explaining what treatment needs to get done leaving me with absolutely no doubts or questions. I got my orthodontic treatment done here ever since and my whitening. I absolutely LOVE my results and have me feeling better than ever with my smile. To anyone out there looking for a dentist with great prices and staff, this is the place to go to! Thank you to everyone there leaving me completely content and in love with my new smile!!<//Review>

<Review>I went to Happy Smiles last week for the first time, I had a deep cleaning done. All the staff there were so nice and friendly. The doctor that did my cleaning did an amazing job.  I had no idea there was such a beautiful office in this shopping center. I was walking by one day and this very nice lady named Jacky handed me a flyer and convinced me to make an appointment. Thanks to her I now have a new dentist.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics></record></dataset><record>

Great place! It is Family friendly and great staff too! Stephanie stood out the most because she greets everyone who walks in. She is also very helpful with all my concerns. She never gives a bad attitude no matter how difficult or busy the office is. Awesome payment plans as well, as I’m currently unemployed they offered me something that could work with my current status and I have a happy smile now!</Review>

Happy Smiles is an amazing establishment. No one likes to go to the dentist, but the team there makes you feel right at home. The facility is clean and very well organized. The staff takes care of you as if you were their own family. Highly recommended for people of all ages, very kid friendly.</Text>

<rate>5</rate><text>After months of looking for a dentist, a family member recommended me this place and I gotta say, I am not disappointed. I called and got an appointment THE SAME DAY. I needed a few treatments to get done and on the first day I was able to get my deep cleaning and cavities treated. Customer service was also perfect. They were very welcoming and I love welcoming environments because I tend to get social anxiety at times.

What made this visit even more amazing though was that the guy who informs on what your insurance covers was so informative. He broke down the costs and explained the process of what would happen without the treatments. Everyone was just amazing. I 100% recommend this place to anyone looking for a dentistry. I didn’t need to go outside of this place to get my wisdom teeth removal appointment either so all around the best!< /text>< Pics>

The staff is incredibly welcoming and knowledgeable and the facility’s ambient is very welcoming and clean. I have referred several family members and friends to this dentistry and they have also been satisfied with their services. This place will provide you with the treatment you need while also making you feel at home.</review>

First off I’ll say I always hated the dentist. Even as an adult I avoided going ! I was experiencing some pain and being New to the area didn't help me at all. I searched  on google and found this place! The office was modern and the vibe was great! Lidia and her staff truly changed my outlook on dentistry. I voiced my concerns with my pain and past experiences. Lidia assured me I was in the best of hands and walked me through every step. I was seen fast, the procedure was excellent and I had little to no discomfort after my root canal !! I hope I won’t need to come back soon but this location has surely won my business and ive already sent a few friends over!!!< /Text>

<Review>Absolutely amazing. I came for my dental exam after not going in a long time. Very welcoming environment all throughout. I had my filling done by a Dr.Arman. I’m terrified of needles but her soft hand, I felt nothing. She did a great job on my filling. I’m currently undergoing an orthodontic treatment and what can I say, great service and work. Dr.Amir is great and attentive Cant wait to smile and be truly happy of my smile. And all that is possible at Happy Smiles. Perfect smile isn’t a dream no more, it’s a reality.</Review>< Pictures>

I guess they feel that people with Dentical can pay $2400 for work to be done. I think they would’ve charged me and the insurance. SMH.<//review>

I am super scared of the dentist but the staff and doctors here at happy smiles have made me feel so comfortable that I can honestly say I am no longer scared of going to the dentist the office manger is so sweet she took the time to explain to me in detailed every single procedure I got a few fillings done and a deep cleaning I was so nervous for the shots but the doctor did such an amazing job I didn’t feel the shots looking forward for my six month visit ☺️</Text>

<username>Jay Pizel</username><Date>1595033446252</Date><Review>The staff here are nice and friendly, not so much about management though. I've seen the owner there several times and comes off as a nice, professional person that greets you at the door sort of like a host.

But to be brutally honest I've seen him talk to his staff very unkindly. He gets awfully close when he greets you, it's a very uncomfortable feeling he stands at that doorway kind of like a troll under a bridge.

I've always showed up to my appointment's on time and still wait 20-30 minutes just to be seated. Why schedule an appointment at a certain time if you can't fulfill your standards. The back staff is always overwhelmed with work so I can't blame them, the front staff needs better training when it comes to scheduling and moving people. Maybe it's not there fault either but someone has to take responsibility.

I'd give this place 1 star but the staff is amazing!!
Great job guys..</Review>< resp>

<user_name>Shirleen Mojica<//user_name><rating>5< /rating><text>The staff here are so amazing! Everyone greets you with a smile. They are all so welcoming. The facility is clean and cute. They had good movies playing in the waiting room. They were very careful and took all safety precautions due to Covid. People are well spaced and socially distant from each other. They took everyone’s temperature before entering. I was not worried at all. I had to get part of my gum removed. The dentist was amazing and efficient. He was also so nice. The dental assistant, Lidia, was such a sweetheart. So accommodating and explained everything that needed to be done in a clear manner. She answered any questions that I had and I had a lot! She made sure I was okay and followed up with me. Overall, i had a wonderful experience with them and I highly recommend them!< /text></record></dataset><record>

AMAZING DENTAL OFFICE
Everyone who works there is so kind and care for their patients! When you go into the office you feel so welcomed and the staff treat you like family! In terms of getting dental work done, the best doctors I have ever met! They are kind and considerate and are bilingual which is great for any patient that wishes to talk about their procedure in either english or spanish. I get my braces done here andf I have had no complain what so ever everything is perfect and you can really see the braces working! Oversall this is the best dental office I have evr been to and I 100% reccomend this place to anyone who needs to get any dental work done!<//Review>

The only reason why I gave them one star is because the dentist who took my tooth out was kind of professional. But when I went back to get my stitches removed the whole time both the nurse and the doctor were speaking Spanish over me when they both know how to speak English. The doctor was just pulling my stitches out with no remorse or compassion while he knew that I was in pain and all the while him and the nurse just laughing and joking away In Spanish. I have never felt so insulted or mistreated in my life , their behavior was so unprofessional and I wouldn’t recommend anyone going to them.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) They do an excellent job to begin with and I say that from experience. There are excellent doctors who offer different options for how to fix your teeth. They made me a bridge and it fit very well. Dr. Rachel was the one who worked for me and she is a very kind doctor and has a lot of experience in what she does. I thank her, God bless her and continue to bless her life and the work that she does. Thanks to everyone who works at Happy Smiles!

<Date>1582832324747</Date><Rating>1</Rating><Text>(Translated by Google) About two weeks ago I went to this dentist to get an exam. After I had an X-ray, a girl named Lidia went on to explain my treatment. the truth was a very poorly educated, rude, and very bloody person. when he was explaining to me about my treatment she was texting on her cell phone. I had no interest in convincing myself to have the treatment there. I would never go back to this place. They need people with more profession and nice!

<Review>Clean and reasonably well maintained, but could pop the modest expense for a couple more internal trash cans.  Have to deduct stars because the owner allows it to be a beer drinking hangout after dark for vagrants and neighborhood teens. A man was inside in his underwear drinking beer and apparently washing the rest of his clothes.  During the day it's better.  But at night it's pretty sordid.</Review><user_id>116243189429219957147<//user_id><rate>2<//rate>< GmapID>

My first visit was great, second.... Terrible. I was early for my appointment and wasn't helped out until after 36 min. They were not ready for me, didn't even bother to look at my medical record, Dr. And assistant calling me by another name, kept trying to make it seem like they new my medical history and Everytime were wrong. Then waited another 32 min (would have been more if I don't go asking for a manager) for the Dr to come in and make awkward small talk and once again assume I'm someone else and to tell me exactly what I knew and told them on my first visit. If you're going to have policies in regards to canceling or being late to appointments, I suggest you give the same treatment to your customers. It's only fair you respect our time as we do yours.</review>

WOW! What an amazing experience. I went in for dental whitening and was really unsure what to expect and a bit nervous, until I met May, she was so wonderful! She explained the process and was so patient, I didn’t feel like I was being rushed to get out of the door she took her time and made sure I got the best care. Also the results of the treatment were amazing! Dr. B was great, he came in and checked on me throughout the whitening process. I will be going in again in a few days to get more dental work done. Never thought I’d enjoy a dental visit this much!</review>

<Review>Today return with my son for his orthodontist appointment which supposed to be done on last Saturday at 4:00 pm if I didn't get the mishap txt message from the office indicated an appointment at 4:30pm. I showed the receptionists the two txt messages and wanted them to know that my son wasn't late to the last Saturday appt because we followed the time we received from their office. Instead of the receptionists apologizing for their mistake, they blamed it on the system made an error.  Also, one of the receptionist said my son showed up at 5:30pm when the office closed at 5 pm on Saturday. FYI, my son and my husband said they actually showed up at 4:25pm and was sent home with the 4pm appointment for today, Monday 24th.  These receptionists are very unprofessional.  I hope this review will help them improve better customer service.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Too bad I can’t cancel my ortho contract that im paying cash.  This will be the 3rd mishap with this office and only been with them since August.  Arrived to my appt this morning to find out it was rescheduled without my knowledge!  Poor work ethic and inconsiderate to say the least.<//text>

Going to the dentist generally isn't a pleasant experience, but everyone here goes the extra mile to make it that way. Dr. Barooty is both skilled, and knowledgeable. I most definitely recommend.</review>

(Translated by Google) The worst place, the worst, I do not recommend them, they only care about your money, my sister continues to pay a permanent crown, which only lasted 3 months and continues to pay the cost is 1300 but she no longer has the crown, they had to keep it because the work did not It was done and in this place they do not want to return your money or put a new one. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE

Malisimo lugar el peor no se los recomiendo solo les importa su dinero mi hermana sigue pagando una corona Permanente que solo le duro 3 meses y sigue pagando  el costo es de 1300 pero ya no tiene la corona se la tubieron que quietar por que el travajo no estuvo vien echo y en este lugar no le quieren regresar su dinero o poner una nueva NO RECOMIENDO ESTE LUGAR< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I highly recommend Monica Ganjoo. I had a complicated case  and with her assistance, I was able to achieve a favorable result.  She was detailed and always kept me posted on my case by email or phone. She is very accessible and treated me with respect.
One thing I loved about Monica was that she gave off positive energy and peace on mind, also let you talk to her with no hesitation. With her help all the obstacles I had gone through had gone by kind of smoothly. I will always recommend her to anyone needing on immigration layer. I strongly say with no doubt that she is fantastic lawyer who will try to solve  your problem. Thank you once again from the bottom of my heart!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Calls are not answered. Emails not responding. Everyone is lost, they do not know what they have to do. They say they will sent you an email and NEVER send it. The lawyer is amazing, but her staff is unprofessional. They do not care about the clients. I think they should be better prepared and aware of their duties as paralegals/assistants. They definitely need  a supervisor.<//Text>< pictures>

I have known Monica for more than 8 years and had the pleasure to work with her for my residency. She is very professional, knowledgeable , responsive, and kind. She cares about her clients. She is definitely one of the best immigration attorneys in US.<//text>

If you're looking for an immigration lawyer Monica would be your best choice. She helped me 11 years ago for my immigration case, then my two kids, my parents, and also many friends that I referred to and all appreciate her professional help. Very responsive, professional, and honest.<//Text>

We had a very pleasant experience with Atty. Ganjoo and Hugo Servin. They were so knowledgeable, professional and provided us with excellent service. They walked us through our application in a detailed manner and have accorded us the guidance we needed in fulfilling all the requirements. We definitely had peace of mind knowing that they had everything taken care of and they consistently followed through the entire application process. We strongly recommend their services.<//review>

I was referred by another lawyer to this law office. After initial consultation with Monica and impressed by her professional analysis on my case, I decided to hire them to help me with my immigration case. It went very well! The initial application package was fully prepared by them after I provided my documents.  In the following months, they always call and email me in the first time whenever there is any updates or requests from CIS.  Meanwhile, I have asked tons of questions by emails. Monica always responses very promptly and gives detailed and professional information. This was really helpful during that long waiting time period.  Finally. I got notice for interview. Danny helped me preparing the interview process. He is very experienced about that. In sum, all of the attorneys are professional and kind. I highly recommend them if you want to get your immigration case in a good hand. I have met many other lawyers who only cares about money instead of your best interest. It is very important to have a lawyer who is always on your side and watch your case for you.<//Text>

Monica helped me during various stages of my immigration process.   Throughout the years, I found her to be quick to respond, very helpful and surprisingly (for a lawyer) empathetic towards my situation.  Most attorneys I've dealt with were always money focused, but with Monica she seemed to actually care about my family's outcome!!!    She's restored my faith in the profession.....<//Text>

<Text>Monica is the best. It may be difficult to get an appointment with her for the very first consultation, but that’s because she’s amazing and she really takes care of her clients and she only takes new consultations once she knows her clients have been taken care of. She was worth waiting three weeks to get a consultation with. But once you hire her, you are in the best of hands. She knows what she is doing and she is amazing at it. She responds to your emails within two hours, even on weekends and nights. She is kind and really knows the law. I have also referred two family members and a friend to her after my case was completed and they have also been extremely successful and happy with her services.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< UserId.>

I had a amazing experience with Monica and her group, I just won my asylum case with the help of Monica and her team. She guided me through everything and on the court day she did a great job, I Believe without her help I couldn’t win my case. Thank you Monica for all your hard work, I totally recommend Monica because she’s professional in this field and you will get what you want with her.</text>

<text>This law office is amazing. I’m forever grateful for all their hard work, not only were they able to help my family with my moms case; but, they did it in the most respectful and quickest way possible. Hugo and Monica are amazing they were with us every step of the way. If you’re looking for someone to help you and keep you updated on your case, I would definitely recommend this law team. Might I add, My family had previously gone to two other law offices for help with my moms case before this and just wasted our time and money. I’m so glad I found Hugo and Monica!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I had spoken to some other lawers before I went to Monica. We had a little unique case and if we had sticked with the first lawer we consulted with , I am sure our case would have been  messed up even before it started. I am glad that we chose Ganjoo Law. Monica and her team  were  great. Real professionals. Definitely recommend to everyone !< /Text>

Until I met Monica Ganjoo!!! I remember how much she cared about my life and understood the importance and the effects of my case on my life !!! It was going to change my life for ever!!! She took over my case and everything just changed for better!!! I remember how she fought for me and how she never ever gave up on my case or me, until she won the case for me in spectacular way!!! She was so professional ,skilled and very experienced in her job !!! Every time I needed something or there was a paper or some important matter that needed to be taking care of, she was already on top of it and before I say or do any thing, she was going above and beyond to take care of it!!! I haven’t seen anybody like her!!! But I have to admit, the number one thing that really impressed me about her was that, she is not just a great lawyer but a great human being!!! A wonderful lady with wonderful heart for people!!! And that’s why in my opinion, she is the best person you can possibly work with and hire!!! Ever since I got to know her as my lawyer, I feel like I have a friend that just got my back no matter what!!! Thank you Monica for everything and Always being awesome!😊<//review>< pictures>

I went to see Monica eight months ago because I had asked the community for a Farsi speaking lawyer and all 4 people I asked referred me to her. 3 had actually been her clients and 1 had a family member who was her client. Monica was AMAZING to work with. She was very friendly and super smart in her job. She came with me to both of my court hearings and responded to my emails within 10 hours each and every time. I got my green
Card. I am so happy. I have already referred two people to her and they are happy as well. Her consultation is only $50 and she credits this to your account once you hire her. She is a superwoman and I am so happy that she was my lawyer.< /Review>

I highly recommend Monica to everyone, She is  a knowledgeable, professional, communicative, and overall such a helpful attorney. Monica has a calm, kind, and a nice personality and  always responded to my emails very quickly, making my difficult moments a lot less stressful. I really could not thank her enough.< /review>

After serveral immigration lawyer's assured us there wasnt much they could do to help my husband fix my immigration status, Monica Ganjoo's law office made it happen at a much lower cost. Although it was a long process, Ganjoo's law office guided us through it all step by step. They made us feel comfortable through the whole process, and were very professional. There are no words that can truly express how happy my husband, and i are!!! Thank you to all the people at Monica Ganjoo's law office.. please continue to provide your services to others in need.. you are truly appreciated.< /text>

Monica is honestly one of the kindest, most generous people I know. When we first moved to the SFO, we were scammed by a horrible lawyer who charged us over $4,000 for doing virtually nothing. We went to Monica instead and found out so many new things that our old lawyer didn't teach us. She was so kind and helpful and patient with us. When I was younger I always wanted to be a lawyer because my grandma was but i always saw it as kind of a backup. Seeing Monica work and learning from her really put that idea into my mind again and now I try my best in school and at home to get the good grades I need. She's such an inspiration to me personally and I'm so happy we had someone like her to help us move to a new country. I hope that I can learn more from her in the future. We moved to a new state last year and Monica couldn't help us with our filing anymore since we weren't in California. We looked for an immigration lawyer here. The first one we found was incredibly rude and not willing to cooperate so we went on to a new one who we couldn't trust. I encouraged my mother to make a call to Monica who gladly agreed to take a look at our papers. Once again, she helped us with one of the last steps to our US citizenship. I'm just so greatful to have an inspiration and helper like Monica. Several immigration lawyers will scam you and try to hurt but I know for a fact that Monica would never. Thank you so much Monica.</text>

<Text>Thank you, Monica for all the effort that you had put into our case. I highly recommend Ganjoo law office for anyone who seek a professional attorney. Monica is very honest, very trustworthy and very helpful. She helped me and my daughter through our green card process back in 2013. She influnced my 8 year old daughter with her strong personality, her classy look and professionality that she is my daughter's role model. My daughter's dream is to be an immigration attorney, like Monica, and she wants to get trained in Monica's office.
We moved to Utah but still Monica is my atterney. I contacted her again to help my in filing for my citizenship and as usual, she was there to help me out.
Monica is the attorney you need to contact for any immigration issue. She will help you with all her power.
Thank you Monica, we love you.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x808fcc98a104e079:0xace3bfa77aee2b45</Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Going to this law office doesn't change anything. Its really wasting money and
time. Its your choice to go to this law office
and waste your time and money. They are not responsible as they should. I dont care about other reviews. My personal experience with her was not positive. I dont know if she is really immigration attorney or not,whatever she didnt care our case. Her employees were so mean and disrespectful so she was. Whenever we called her office they barely responded our phone or if they responded us they refused talk to us. They just said Monica is busy or im busy then turned off the phone rudely. They were so irresponsible worst than her. All she cares is money but not her clients. She was supposed to follow up our visa extention case but, she was so careless about it. She is very arrogant. I frankly say that.  Again,its your choice to spend your money there.</Review>

<username>Gina Moren< /username><review>(Translated by Google) They gave me an appointment on the phone (somewhat awkward)
And little understandable with a cost of $ 100 that was maximum 10-15 minutes
The lawyer only spoke English AND the assistant translated us, we felt that the lawyer did not clearly understand the case
After hanging up the call, they left a voicemail to tell us that the case could be done, that we communicate if we had questions, return the call several times leaving voicemail, later an assistant with a bad attitude communicated, (María He said to call himself) that if I had more questions, another appointment had to be paid, I did not understand why I had to pay again, If the appointment had already been paid.

(Original)
Me dieron una cita por teléfono (algo incómodo)
Y poco entendible con un costo de $100  que fue máximo 10-15 minutos
El abogado solo hablaba inglés Y la asistente nos traducío, sentimos  que el abogado no entendió claramente el caso
Después de colgar la llamada, dejaron Un correo de voz para decirnos que el caso si se podía hacer, que nos comunicáramos si teníamos preguntas, regrese la llamada varias veces dejando correo de voz, más tarde se comunico una asistente con mala actitud, (María dijo llamarse) que si tenía más preguntas se tenía que pagar otra cita, No entendí porque tenía que pagar otra vez, Si ya se había pagado la cita.< /review><GmapID>0x808fcc98a104e079:0xace3bfa77aee2b45<//GmapID><Response>None<//Response><user_id>112078079378154144957<//user_id>< pictures>

My husband and I have been wanting to try this place since it opened and we finally went last night!  This will definitely be one of our go to places from now on.  We had the loaded nachos (a generous sized plate of nachos),  + shrimp and steak tacos.  Everything was awesome. The service was excellent, too.  Oh and the margarita was perfect.  A+ for food, drinks and service.< /text>

I highly recommend the taquitos, great item to share, and they come with a hearty serving of guac. Their chips and salsa were also super yummy. The service was also spectacular. Veronica helped us out and she was super sweet, checked in on often, gave us great recommendations, and made sure to tell us about the specials and happy hour menu. She provided excellent customer service; I wish more servers/waiters were like her.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSEH-3wy_IWNDe7eOnMla4A9sKbB9M9XjMXxR0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMM7DNTs_w57AkUwaJ4uoqElABIWoNvKSmQN2lr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

My girl really enjoyed the mango margarita. I had the cucumber one they were a little sweet for me but she loved hers. $12 ea. The tacos we're okay ,not bad. I didn't like the al pastor at all that was not tender or flavorful. The mole  taco was really good I had to order another. We had to sit outside because of the current situation and we froze the whole time. There isn't enough heaters out there so won't be coming back at night. They had a Dj bumping some music which was cool and the bar is really nice. They also had some $5 tequila shots going on too. I thought the service was really bad though, they had a lot of servers standing around talking to each other we lost our service for over 30 mins at one point waiting to order more drinks and food and no there servers wanted to help us out. The food just isn't that amazing to deal with that or the prices for me personally.</Text>

We went for lunch. The staff is extremely friendly and the place itself is cool. The food was great. They’ve really perfected the “small menu good quality.” Tasty tacos that weren’t too small for amazing prices ($2.25 ea street tacos). Plenty of drinks, awesome service.</text>

<Review>$92.00 for tacos, a burrito, 3 margaritas and a beer.  How is that even possible? We had to ask for napkins? We were told they were Cadillac margaritas, they were not, they were gracious enough to take one margarita off the bill but then they didn't? So we just paid and left. Terribly 😞 disappointed.</Review>< Time>

Really liking the interior decor and layout of the restaurant. The menu is nice and simple to follow. Amazing food, drinks, and service, very attentive. I had the taco perron and esqueleto margarita. The taco perron had perfect balance in flavor and the meat was tender. The esqueleto margarita complement the taco well! Will be back!</review>

<Text>greasy food, tequilas made with artificial flavoring, slowest service ever!! They brought my food topped with 3 long hairs, i told them and they comeback 5 secons later with the plate without the hair, so of course they just remove the hair and they brought to me the same order!</Text>< Pictures>

Tried this place 2 times, both of them were bad!
We were waiting for so long to get our drinks, at least 1 hour🙄 and the worst part comes when we get the bill, it was like if we went to a gourmet restaurant!!!
Now I'd rather go to outback to get a nice dinner and better service than come back here!<//Review>

<review>I am giving it 3 starts because the food was good. But the drinks could not been more terrible. The horchata tasted like sour gone bad milk with lemonade. And the melon juice tasted like a gone bad orange Gatorade. We were afraid to drink them.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I placed an order 12/20 on postmates under the name Heber and they confirmed the order but then cancelled it like half an hour after. The number on their website seems disconected and its hard to find other contact info and I still have not recieved so much as a text message telling me why Angelica decided to cancel my order. Maybe this issue can be resolved soon, I hope.</review>

Service took forever. We asked a question on the menu while ordering and our waiter didnt come back for 15 minutes and forgot we had a question and thought we ordered. So we had to wait for him to go ask again.

Their menu is very limited IMO. Beside appetizers its just 2 burritos and a few tacos.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Had an incident with one of their delivery drivers, who was  driving recklessly in a nearby parking lot.

While attempting to speak with him he immediately started to swear at me and my spouse.

His behavior was so angry that I immediately went into the store and informed the manager.

Hopefully they will take action as he reflects poorly upon the company.< /Review><time>1614466959790</time>< Pics>

The carpet we chose ended up going on sale plus no tax. Ended up being quite reasonable. My installer says the carpet is good quality and the pad is excellent. Ran into a small snag when they neglected to call when it came in. Took a little patience to get someone to answer the phone and locate it. Everything else went smoothly. Considering Lowes and Home Depot can't get any carpet until after Christmas this was a quick turnaround. Got two of the three bedrooms installed yesterday and it looks great.</review>< pictures>

Well I was at S&G carpet today to pick out carpet colors.  We had carpet installed by S&G several years ago.  The installation went very well and we were totally satisfied.  But this year the carpet has developed rinkles in the hallway so I asked them to re-stretch  it.  They sent two different crews to do the work but both said that the hallway had too many doorways off of it and it could be re-stretched  properly.  S&G agreed and so they are now going to replace all the carpet at no cost to us.  I can't say enough good about S&G!!!<//review>

The flooring is beautiful!  The install, perfect!  I could not be happier.  The installers, Jose and Antonio, oh my goodness....the best.  They were fast, professional, very pleasant and at the end of each day you couldn't tell they were here.  They cleaned up every bit of their mess (work debris).  Very hard workers, and they laughed and sang the whole time.  I feel so very blessed to have Jose and Antonio for the install!  Thank you S&G Carpet.< /Review>

S & G in Elk Grove recently installed new vinyl flooring in three of our rooms. The S & G team did a great job and exceeded our expectations.  I highly recommend S & G to others who are looking for new flooring in the Sacramento area.< /review>

I used them for a project. They said they had flooring in stock so I ordered, a month later still not in stock. No customer service or apology regarding. A very small discount was offered for delaying our remodel substantially. Wont be using them again or referring any more clients to them.</Text>

I am highly suspicious of the positive reviews.

We called them for a measuring and cost estimate which resulted in first, waiting on hold while they “logged on “for several minutes, then we received 4 texts on Mother’s Day from someone who never identified herself by name
asking for carpet color preferences. Very bad business practice to bother people on a Sunday and a family day. She then failed to reply to her own questions 4 texts later. We had to ask her for confirmation of her appointment time change.

The person who came to measure told us he would email the estimate that day. He never did, that day or ever. Just disappeared. I am now receiving phone calls from out sources so I suspect they sell your information.

He did, however, tell us if we signed on the dotted line that day he would give us a “ great deal”. Very unprofessional and a rediculously high verbal cost estimate. We bought elsewhere and I advise you do the same.< /Review>

Jonathan helped me in the Elk Grove Store, and explained the quality of carpets, pricing, and availability. Then he left me alone (which I appreciated). He answered all my questions and then took multiple phone calls from me over a few days throughout my deliberation process. Customer service was excellent. The carpet installers were professional and efficient. I’m leaving off one star because the labor was more costly than I liked, however S&G did work with me on cost of carpet and padding. They also met Home Depot’s quote, and we’re available in days as opposed to weeks! Would definitely recommend S&G Carpet.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>We had a great experience with S&G once Carol Peak became our sales rep. She displayed solid patience as we took more than a week to select the floor that was right for us and she then hunted it down after it turned out that we may not be able to go with our first choice. The installation crew, led by Bob Carr, was quick getting the job done one day quicker than had been projected. They also did a real bang up job. We are very happy with our new floor. Thank you S&G.<//text>< Pictures>

Just wanted to say that after an extensive hunt for for carpet, comparing everyone out there and what they had to offer and all the quotes, we went with S & G carpet and they match the best price we found and we were able to get it installed ASAP in time for the Holidays. Tara was great in the sales dept and Max , who installed it was awesome!!! No one came close being able to get our carpet installed till after the holidays but S & G had it made, shipped from Georgia and installed all in about 3 weeks. They were great!!!</text>

S&G Carpeting did a great job installing carpet throughout our house. 8 months later we had a water leak while we were out of town. After we dried out the carpet, S&G replaced the pad in the areas affected by the water leak. We were very satisfied with their workmanship. We highly recommend S&G for the quality of their carpet, their customer service, and their expert installers!</review>

<review>Everyone who works for this company is wonderful. I had visited a few other companies when I wanted new carpet for my house but when I walked into this branch, I felt like I was home. The pricing, feel, and people are all around genuine and a pleasure to do work with!< /review>< pictures>

If anyone is thinking of getting new flooring, I highly recommend "Not" to waste your time shopping around at any BIG BOX stores. Unlike those stores, Julie Santos at S&G Carpet, EG gave our family the Red Carpet treatment.  Julie knows her store and her product.  We came in with samples and pricing from other stores and Julie not only gave us better quality flooring but also pricing was Great!

The installers were on time and professional.  They take a lot of pride on their work.

Our home looks great and there is nothing better than the smell of new carpet and hardwood floors.

Julie, thank your professionalism, great work ethics and I believe we have a new friend. :-)</Text>

<date>1359416493069</date><text>We purchased wood flooring from S&G to be installed by our own installer and when the wood arrived it did not appear to be what we ordered.  At the end of the day it was what was ordered but it was severely misrepresented by the manufacturer of the wood.  However, S&G went out of there way to make it right even though it was not something that was their fault.  As it was something that the manufacturer of the wood was responsible for we did not expect anything from S&G and not only did they make it right but they offered to correct the matter without us even asking.  They have wonderful customer service and would definitely do business with them in the future.< /text></record>

Bottom line they took my money, gave me the wrong order, made no attempt to fix the issue. Horrible service and horrible way to do business. Will not be going back again.

A huge 'thank you' to Bayyinah and Robert for their patience, professionalism and expertise in assisting my wife to select new flooring for our remodel. It was a frightfully small installation, but they were SO helpful in making the selection process easy with a wide selection of flooring options. We found S&G VERY easy to do business with and their pricing was competitive. Would purchase from them again in a heartbeat.<//text>

< Review>
What a great little Chinese restaurant that is packed with flavors. I’ve dined and ordered many party trays for birthday and special celebrations and they never disappoint us.
This time we ordered the cheese wrap wonton, egg rolls, and spicy fried chicken wings. Everyone loved it😋😋! All asked where I got them from...of course I told them I got it from T&Z Chinese Restaurant.
I highly recommend this place for nice authentic Chinese foods and food party catering.</Review>

I love this place. We order from her about every 2 months for the last 5 years and we enjoy their food evertime. This is one those mom and pop, or local restaurants i try to support during these troubling times thats not a franchise.<//review>

I used to go here when it was under different management/ownership. Used to be OK, but now it's fantastic. Dinner combination is basically 2 meals for a big appetite. Great deal. I should have came back sooner. Good food. Good portions. Good price. Nice people.</Review>

We have been looking for good Chinese food in the area for a few weeks now.  We tried a handful of places in Sacramento that had great reviews and none of them were very good.  Finally today we came to T&Z and we have definitely found our new favorite Chinese food restaurant!!  The food was absolutely AWESOME and the service was also AWESOME.  We will be back many times to come.  Seriously if you want good Chinese food in Sacramento CA, you should be here, period.<//Review>

I made a decision to attempt this restaurant based on all the terrific reviews as well as I rejoice I did. This restaurant was even much better than I expected. For beginners, the restaurant itself was very tidy as well as organized which is something I always check for at a restaurant.The food was scrumptious as well as the portion sizes were sufficient. The rates are really cost effective and my to-go order prepared when I arrived. I was welcomed with a kind smile and even provided a free beverage. I will be back to eat below once more and will definitely suggest this dining establishment to any individual looking for a delicious dish.<//Review>

<text>I have been here several different times and ordered several different things from the menu. The food is always excellent and the service is always top notch. Often times we are on a short time frame and phone in our order ahead of time. Our food comes out shortly after we get there. Always a pleasant experience!</text>< pictures>

<Text>If you like fantastic Chinese food and have a limited budget, this place is for you! Their dinner plates are about $10, even if you order shrimp (which is still delicious). You get your entree, chow mein and/or fried rice, an entirely separate pint container filled with sweet and sour chicken, and a vegetable egg roll. They don't skimp you on food, is what I'm getting at. They deliver to certain areas, and are extremely kind. They messed up on a call in order I made and when I called them back, they were more than willing to fix the issue. I've never had a bad experience here, and I can't wait to try their dine-in. Soups are not to go, be prepared.< /Text>< pictures>

Best Chinese food ever!! They are the friendliest, sweetest and best service I've ever had at any restaurant. They make special dishes for us and dote on our son. They remember our orders and the portions are huge, fresh and incredibly affordable. For $50 (with 20%+ tip) we will have leftovers for two days. The orange beef and my husband's favorite and they make a special order of salt and pepper ribs with BBQ ribs for me. They also make a special bowl of soup for our son. We love going here and I tell everyone how fantastic the restaurant is!! Do not miss out, they're in a strip mall and easy to miss, but they are completely 100% worth traveling to eat at!!! I'd give them more stars if I could!!</text>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Zero stars is what they’re deserving of. While I won’t spend to much energy and time with this location, it’s a major disappointment to phone in an order only to be told that they can’t do deliveries and will graciously provide a free egg roll in its place. That’s the first joke. Second joke is that we get to their restaurant only to find out that our order was just picked up. We looked at the owner in pure astonishment that they don’t have a system in place to ensure patrons receive their correct orders. Rather than offer to remake our food, we’re told that the kitchen was closed which is funny because the window to the kitchen portrayed a different story. From their poor customer service to the lack of resolution is a another reason I’ll happily give my money to a restaurant that actually cares about customer satisfaction.</review>< Pics>

The food is good, but the cups and forks need to be cleaned better. Went there a few times and the cups of water sometimes have a piece of floating rice. The forks sometimes have piece of food from the previous person using it. I drew the line after one day when I found a piece of clay or sink pudding sealer in my fried rice. Not sure if I can upload a picture in this review, but I'm grossed out.</review>

Have to say I must have ordered everything wrong on the menu!!  Food is lacking in flavor and was nearly unedible !!  Would NEVER Recommend this food and will NEVER order again. Terrible!!

<text>Nice neighborhood.  Warm and friendly welcome as I walked in to pick up my order.  Very good beef chow mein, chicken chow mein, and combination fried rice.  Looking forward to try their other entrees. Quality food and generous proportion.  Such a pleasant experience from ordering over the phone to our dinner table.  My teenage daughters are very picky, and they gave T&Z five stars and I did too.<//text><user>102561825672725657438< /user></record>

<review>If you liked the food at Good Friends across the street, then you'll enjoy the food here. Chefs and staff rebranded Happy Chinese Restaurant; this location has similar food for basically the same price. Since they're not as well known as Good Friends, you can usually get a spot really fast. While they may not have the Japanese menu here, they are open on Sundays. I'll take that trade-off :)</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Simply horrible. It screams "MSG" right when you start eating it: tastes pretty good at first, then you feel extremely full, tired and sleepy, and in about an hour you get a stomach pain. So, if you want to avoid MSG in your food — keep away from this place.<//review>

<Review>My grandpa lives in LA so we always have him tell us what's good. He was feeling a bit under the weather and we thought soup would be good for him. He chose this spot and got chicken soup and asked for the chicken to be fried and packed so he could eat that later, as it was a lot of food for him. His soup looked good, had lots of veggies.

I had a pupusa revuelta and tamal de pollo. The pupusa was excellent, probably one of the best I've had in a long time!  For me a great pupusa is one in which the totilla portion is not greasy and the filling is on point. Some places try to gyp you and will add chicharon and cheese but no beans, when it actually should have all 3 items mixed in!  The pupusa here was not greasy and the filling was great with stringy cheese! The tamal was okay, a bit dry. The ensalada drink was also very good. Some places make what seems like an artificial mix and add fruit, which I hate. This place makes a fresh juice with natural fruits and the perfect sweetness. I will return next time I'm in the area!< /Review>< pics>

Excellent results with Kevin’s service. He was on time and did an outstanding job! Scotty, the owner responded to my request right away and was able to send service the very next day, which was really important. I will be using them in the future, for sure and have already recommended them to a friend!<//Text>

Not only was Scott super nice, he gave me a reasonable quote with no hidden fees and set me up with a time that worked for me. Kevin came and did my carpet and he did an amazing job and was super fast! Also the way my apartment is makes it really hard for them to bring in the equipment but he spent his time making it work. Thank you Kevin and Scott for the great service! Will be using again.<//Text>

Easy Clean Carpet Care provided great customer service!  He even called to tell me he was a few minutes away.  The day of the cleaning they came in the expected window and did a great job, especially with our white shaggy area rug!  They did the upstairs hallway and 3 bedrooms plus the stairs and only took about an hour.  We are very pleased with their work and was very responsive when I called with  questions.  I highly recommend Easy Clean, especially the work and customer service of Kevin!<//Text>

Amazing customer service. Scotty made scheduling carpet cleaning before move out super easy. Steven did an amazing job with the carpets I could not ask for anything more. This company is super professional, does a great job, and extremely affordable. If you're moving out of yolo county I definitely recommend scheduling with Easy Clean Carpet Care!</review>

I highly recommend Easy Clean Carpet Care. I requested services on two staircases and an area rug. Jeff showed up early and did an exceptional job. He went above and beyond what I expected. My stairs had pet stains and he put extra detail in those areas, as well as other areas of concern. He even went over the area twice to ensure the stains and Odor were taken care of. He was polite and a hard worker. The prices are fair and the product is pure. My carpets look brand new and that’s amazing for 2 year old  stairs that have only been professionally cleaned once. If I could give more then 5 stars I would!! Thank you Scotty for getting me in only hours after I called and providing great employees.</Review>

Scotty's Easy Clean sent Jeff, who is very knowledgeable and enthusiastic, and worked his butt off.  He brought the van so anything he pulled up went outside.  I'd had a rodent, so I needed sanitizing as well as a deep clean for my carpets and a couple pieces of furniture.  My place is super clean now and smells great.  Well worth the money, and I can relax again.  Highly recommend.< /Review>

I had an amazing experience with Easy Clean Carpet Care! Steven was the tech that came out to clean the upholstery in my vehicle. The upholstery was extremely dirty and had multiple spill stains (some as old as a year) from having 4 young children in the car. Steven was extremely thorough, spent hours going over each and every seat multiple times and he didn’t leave until I was 100% satisfied and the seats looked new again.Easy clean staff are extremely professional and they stand by their work.  I highly recommend this company and will continue to use them for all of my carpet and upholstery needs!</review>

Scotty, the owner, answered my call and his price couldn't be beat.  To top that he was able to have someone at our house on the same day when others were quoting me 7 - 10 days wait time and an extra $100 for the same service.

Steve, our technician, notified me in advance of his arrival, and did an outstanding job when he arrived.  Steve took the time to make sure our reclining sofa and double-reclining love seat were spotless, and for the extra $100 that the other guys wanted I got pet odor removal, fabric treatment to prevent future stains and issues, and Steve even cleaned our 9x12 area rug for no extra charge.

Talk about above and beyond service.

I will definitely be using them for all of my cleaning needs going forward.<//text>

Scotty and his team are amazing! I have use them several times for the past couple years. They always make their time window, are professional, communication is amazing, they suck out all the water possible to speed up dry time and are fast.

I have also used them for carpet repair. Amazing work you can’t even tell that there is a patch there. Helps I have left over carpet.

You guys have client for as long as I live here. See ya next year!< /Text>

Scotty's guy was awesome, he explained what he needed to do in specific areas in my home.  He was very careful with my walls. doors and furniture.  He did the home in the order I needed to have it done, since I work remotely.  Carpet came out incredible.  They're not your everyday carpet cleaning company.  Scott will answer the phone, answer texts and get it all done efficiently and professionally.  His guy wore a mask the entire time he was  in my home.<//Text>

I called and spoke with the owner Scott on a Saturday, he was very responsive and accomdating with sending a technician around our busy schedule. The technician Vinny arrived on time and was professional, did a thorough job and was quick. Carpets and upholstery look amazing. Will definitely use Easy Clean Carpet in the future.</Text>

I’m glad they did because they did an amazing job! The owner Scotty is very responsive and helpful, and Kevin did a great job cleaning my carpets! It was a great deal too! I had my carpets cleaned a year ago by a different company and they didn’t do nearly as good of a job and were more expensive! I’ll use Easy Clean for any future jobs and I recommend them to anyone looking for their services.</review>< pics>

We chose Easy Clean Carpet Care as I talked directly with the owner Scotty when I called. Plus I wanted to give a local business the opportunity to clean our carpet instead of using a franchise. The carpet came out beautiful. The technician Jeff was professional and knew exactly what our carpets needed. He was on time and explained everything he was doing and everything along the process. I have used local carpet cleaners before but I have never had such great service nor professionalism as I had with Easy Clean. I highly recommend this company with confidence.<//review>

<Text>I had a last minute request on a Sunday for this company to come clean my carpet. They were the only ones that would take my call on a Sunday. The carpet was stained and stunk of dog urine and dirty from work boots. After they left the carpet looked brand new and I didn’t smell anything. 5 stars. I’ll be using them again.<//Text><gmap_id>0x809adfef0fce3f7f:0x29609df9ea8459d<//gmap_id>< UserId.>

Day after Christmas I woke up at my moms home seeing that my dogs had urinated and had diarrhea all over my moms white carpet
I tried getting it out to no avail. I felt really bad as my dogs are house broken and this had not happen in the past. I looked up carpet cleaners nearest me
Easy Care came out that same day. He did an excellent job, actually her carpet looked brand new
He got out urine stains we did not realize were even there. My mom and I could not have been happier, let alone someone who was able to come out. In fact, she was so pleased she is having them come back and clean all of tile.<//Text>

The professionals at Easy Clean Carpet Care are simply the best. Finally, I've found a company whose employees take obvious pride in the job they do. My 20-year-old carpet looks brand new after Vinny cleaned it last week. Vinny was as capable, professional, courteous, and efficient as have been all the service technicians Easy Clean Carpet Care has sent to my home over the past three years. I will continue to call on Easy Clean Carpet Care to take care of my carpet for years to come. They are the best!</Text>

<Review>I never looked more forward to writing a review like this one. You'll never have to call another carpet cleaning company again. From the owner (Scott) on down to the guys in the field, this outfit is top notch. Super friendly people, quality cleaning, affordable. Scott and Jason really worked with me and my elderly mother.
And I can't speak highly enough about Jason who actually done the cleaning. Jason went out of his way to do more than we asked. He disinfected all the areas and then some. This was important to me being that my mom is in her nineties. Usually you end up paying more than you planned. Not with these guys. I ended up paying less. After they're done you will want to tip these guys. As far as we're concerned they have a customer for life..... that's because they earned it!</Review>< pics>

Our carpet cleaner retired after 25 years.  A search of the internet produced the company with the highest rating, Easy Clean. I called them at 4 pm and they came out the next day. Vinnie was a nice guy and did a great job. We have a large 2 story with a brick walk up, so I was ready to get gouged. I wasn’t, so it looks like I have a new carpet cleaning company.</review>

The rep I had (so sorry I forgot your name) was there in an emergency within just a couple hours of our initial call. He was friendly and wore a mask which was very nice for me to not have to ask. I have a baby so that's important. They gave a great deal, the carpets looked like new, and they were very fast from start to finish. Will be using them again in the future. I hope I get home he same rep too!</review>

I reached out to easy clean carpet care in a pinch when my previously scheduled service provider cancelled on me just 2 hours before my service time! Scotty scheduled my service right away and went above and beyond to ensure my carpets were cleaned and I didn’t have to worry about anything! I will definitely be using this service again and will be recommending this company to all my friends!<//review>

< review>
I called Easy Clean for carpet stretching and cleaning, and they came out the next day. Steven was our technician— he was very friendly, communicative, and detail oriented. He kept me updated on his status and arrived on time. He did such an awesome job with the carpet— we had a few “bubbles” that we didn’t think would come out, but Steven was able to stretch them down and make it look like new. You can’t even tell there was a bubble there anymore! He took his time and stayed late to make sure the job was done, including the cleaning. Thanks for the awesome work!</review>

< Review>
I had a stain from soda on my new area rug that wouldn’t come out with typically carpet stain remover. I sent a message this morning (12/27/19) and received a quick and detailed response from Scotty the owner. He was able to make it out on what seemed to be a very busy day for him. He initially couldn’t guarantee he could remove the stain because of the type of rug and other reasons but he was able to get it out and it looks as good as new!! I am so grateful as this is a brand new rug!

I highly recommend Easy Clean Carpet Care and I will be using his service again.<//Review>

If I could give more than 5 stars I would. Not only was this the best carpet cleaning experience I've had. But my technician Jason, gave me some of the best customer service I've ever had. He was very friendly and worked very quickly, and thoroughly. Their prices are very reasonable. I would recommend "Easy clean carpet care" to anyone that needs a carpet cleaning service.< /Review>

<Review>When I called Easy Clean I was able to get same day service. Tech. Jason contacted me to let me know his ETA. He showed up on time and told me step by step what he was going to do. He gave a full quote before starting. When he was setting up, I noticed he put down mats to protect my hard wood floors and he put corner guards up around the house. Took about an hour-hour and a half, he was very thorough. The carpets look amazing. I waited a couple weeks to leave a review because I wanted to see if any of the spots would come back and they have not. I would definitely recommend these guys and ask for Jason again.</Review>< Resp>

<review>EASY CLEAN CARPET CARE saved the day!  Another carpet cleaner company cleaned our carpets with chemicals, without water or extraction of dirt. We had swirls of dirt all over. It was awful.  We called EASY CLEAN.  They came out on a holiday! and deep cleaned our carpets.  The carpets look like new!  They also cleaned our small area rugs at no extra charge.

<text>I have used Easy Clean approximately 3 times now and I have been happy with the outcome of my carpet every time. I will definitely continue using this company. Steve came yesterday and he did an awesome job and you can tell he takes pride in his work.

Update: I used Easy Clean again for my carpets. They never fail to make my carpets look so clean! I have dogs and getting my carpets cleaned is a must. I also get the pet deodorizer. Kevin was my tech this time and he was friendly.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

We had Easy Clean Carpet Care come out and clean 3 carpeted rooms for a rental house we were moving out of. When the first guys arrived his machine stopped working and I was so worried that we wouldn’t be able to get the carpets cleaned that day. But he called someone else who showed up 10 minutes later and finished the job!! Both guys we met were super nice and professional. I would recommend this company any day of the week. The carpets looked great and the price was great too!</Text>

I called Easy Clean Carpet Care hoping to get same day service. Scotty was able to get me scheduled! I called 2 more companies before and they either didnt pick up a phone or had the time in a week. Anyway, carpet cleaner Vinny was on time, friendly and got my carpet done so fast!
The quality is great and smells so clean and fresh.
Affordable, reliable and friendly!< /Review>

<text>I have only great things to share regarding my experience with this carpet cleaning company.  The owners name is Scott.  This is my second time using this company and I dont ever forsee myself using another company.  I referred  this company out to my family which also used Scott's carpet care on two ocassios.
Here is my opinion.  Professional, thorough, polite, easy to work with, reasonable in price and very good about providing knowledge and great carpet care with highly trained technicians.  The products used on my very old rugs cleaned my carpets to give my rugs a new the appearance of being partly new in condition.  The technician was very good about doing a diligent job.  The service is amazing and Scott, the owner makes every effort to be available for questions and you never need to wait long for an appointment.
I hope this review helps for anyone in need of an excellent carpet cleaning company.  He is above the rest.< /text><Name>John Caruso</Name><Response>None</Response></record>

Steve was very professional, knowledgeable, and provided quality service. The carpet was so stained and dirty after a tenant moved out. I wasn't sure if we could save the carpet. Steve did amazing work. He knew how to remove the red stain, the blue stain, and the black stains. The carpet looks brand new! He went beyond what he had to do. I will always have Steve clean our home and rental properties!</text>

I'm never disappointed with Easy Care Carpet Care.  They handle my pet stained carpets with ease.  Steve went above and beyond in getting my carpets clean.  He was pleasant, honest, and got the job done!  Wonderful service!</review>

< review>
New to Sac area and had a feline urine “situation”. Saw on the Easy Clean website that they “did” animal odors & called. Scott said they needed to come out same day of call to get the problem cleaned b4 the odor set in. Marcus, who was so great, showed up at the end of his already scheduled day - 5:15!  The mattress was as good as new and odor free when Marcus was done. I would definitely recommend this company. Not the least expensive but gets a tricky job done!!!<//review>

{'time': 1555292648812, 'text': 'Hi Patty, Great to hear that Marcus save the day. Pet odor on mattresses and furniture can be challenging. That’s why it’s important to address it as soon as possible. For example, pet urine can soak into the foam/cushion area and treatments along with extraction are difficult to physically remove the contaminants. Sometimes multiple steps are necessary to accomplish the removal or even just replace the foam if possible. We take pride in our standards of quality of service and IICRC certification for all the team. Thanks for sharing that five star experience.'}<//Response>

Scotty from Easy Clean is everything a manager should be.  His knowledge and expertise really helped me in making the best decision for the carpets in my house (which ended up needing more than just a basic cleaning). I highly recommend this company, they will do what is best for your situation and I also loved that they were able to come out so quick!< /Review>

Same Day Service! Great explanation detailing what to expect with cost, communication, possibilities of cleaning needs depending on condition of carpet, chemicals, deodorizers and   all on the phone before scheduling appt. Technician Steve went Above AND Beyond with excellent care and attentiveness to what our carpet needs were. Steve returned next day to make sure carpets were as clean as they could be. Steve even mopped our hardwood flooring...for FREE! Excellent, Full of Integrity AND Efficiency! Affordable!<//Review>

<Review>Was looking online for someone to clean carpets at a reasonable price but still quality work before the hokidays. Requested a quote & within minutes was contacted & given a quote & set up an appointment for cleaning.

Fast forward to day of service Vinny texted to give me an ETA and was on time! He was amazing! Answered all of my questions without making me feel stupid for asking, was 100% honest about what he thought he could do & did an even better job than I was expecting. He was very friendly and professional. I would highly recommend Easy Clean Carpet Care and will definitely use them again.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>It was very easy and convenient to book with Easy Clean Carpet: good communication, reasonable price, very professional service. I had 3 wool area rugs cleaned, two in the home and one taken back to their shop and returned a couple of days later. Marcus did an amazing job on all 3 rugs including repositioning them afterwards and they are now probably cleaner than when I bought them.<//Review>< Pics>

The last cleaning that we had done by another company was a disappointing experience. My neighbor recommended Easy Clean and I’m so grateful she did. My carpets have never looked better! The owner, Scott, listened to my concerns and assured me that this would be a better experience. The technician, Marcus, was awesome! He worked incredibly hard to bring my carpets back to life, even staying late in a Friday afternoon to make sure we were satisfied.

We had our carpets cleaned, a mattress and a sectional. Ronnie was very helpful, polite and he cleaned things very thoroughly until the water was clear. Everything turned out great! When I booked the appointments I talked with Scott who is the owner, and he was so helpful, kind and took his time to explain any and all processes with me. I'd gladly refer any friends here and am going to book them again soon!< /review>

Very quick and very effective. Our carpet is not very old but we do have some high traffic areas that look like new after this cleaning. Vinny was very friendly and made us feel very comfortable about staying in the house while he was cleaning, he also explained what he was doing throughout the entire process. I would absolutely recommend Easy Clean Carpet Care to anyone!<//text>

My experience with Easy Clean Carpet Care was very positive.  Starting with setting up the appointment with Scott who was friendly and professional over the phone. He understood what I needed and gave me a good price. Next I received excellent service from Marcus who did the actual cleaning.  He was friendly also and took the time to explain the process and went the extra mile to give my carpet the deep clean that was requested. Everything was "easy and clean!" I would use Easy and Clean Carpet Care in the future and also recommend to a friend.
Sincerely,
Deidra  S.</Text>

Called this company out of the blue when I needed carpet care right away.  Probably took a whole hour to get someone in on their day off to come give me an estimate.  The price quoted was  so reasonable, I couldn't pass it up.  The job was done quickly , meticulously, and perfectly.  I will be a repeat  customer.  Thanks guys!</Review>

Cody even got out the stains left from previous renters. Landlord asked for contact info so she can use them in the future. Great work!

We needed our couch cleaned the day after Thanksgiving. Easy Clean was available and Steve came to the the rescue. He was meticulous, thorough and knowledgeable about his work and our couch looks brand new. He explained that a good clean is all about using the right chemistry and that he has been trained to make sure it's done the right way. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for excellent work at a fair price.</review>

<text>This morning Marcus cleaned my carpet and furniture,  he did a fantastic job.   I have four dogs and my carpets were pretty dirty.   I have had my carpets cleaned many times by various companies and various technicians, Marcus is my favorite,  by far.  He works very hard to please his customers,  he goes above and beyond, and takes time to do a very good job.  He seems very knowledgeable and is very professional.   I highly recommend this company and Marcus.

Scott at Easy Clean is the best!! He sent Marcus over to get some tough stains out and do a full service carpet cleaning. As usual Easy Clean comes through again and the carpets look great! The service is 1st rate and it was fast and easy to book. They are always there when you need them!

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Dear Easy Care,

Yesterday I had my entire home cleaned by your technicians, Scott & Warner.  They did an excellent job.  We have a small dog and your professionals removed the pet odor and stains from soiled spots as well as gave extra attention to the high traffic areas.  Your prices were fair for the amount of work done.  I will definitely use your service again.  Great job.

Sincerely,
Ed Johnson

We would only recommend additional  treatments for Xtreme soil/water damage or a pet related issue. That’s why we always give a complete a valuation and walk through before we start any work. You will know the price before we start and there will be no hidden surprises. That’s just great business. Awesome review and thank you for sharing.'}< /response>

Great work and great customer service. Every other cleaning service would quote one price on phone and a different price in person upon arrival. No such issue with these guys. Thanks<//review>

Vinnie was my carpet technician. He was very professional and thorough. He called to let me know he was on his way. He pre-treated the stains and completed the 4 rooms and hallway in about an hour. All the stains were gone and remain gone after 2 weeks. They definitely get my referral.<//Text>

Arrived a little late but I understand that time if day and traffic. Not a problem. Steve showed up, friendly, committed and dedicated to my satisfaction. Even agreed to clean my throw rug and runners at no additional cost. The advertised price wasn't exactly the quote I received but I did have them clean the stairs and the upper landing in addition to the 3 rooms, and still, was only quoted $8 above the advertised price.  I'll take that deal everyday. And by the way,carpet looks great.< /Text>

That person was stuck on a job and they had to send someone else (he did a great job), but it pushed back our afternoon plans because he arrived later.</Text>

<Text>Arrived a little late but I understand that time if day and traffic. Not a problem. Steve showed up, friendly, committed and dedicated to my satisfaction. Even agreed to clean my throw rug and runners at no additional cost. The advertised price wasn't exactly the quote I received but I did have them clean the stairs and the upper landing in addition to the 3 rooms, and still, was only quoted $8 above the advertised price.  I'll take that deal everyday. And by the way,carpet looks great.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp><rate>4<//rate><time>1466001718620< /time>< user_id>

I recently purchased (second hand) a large sectional couch. After getting it home, I realized it had a very strong pet odor. It was a Sunday morning and there was no way I could go 24 hours with the smell. Easy Clean returned my desperate call and actually fit me in that same Sunday afternoon to steam clean it. Stephen gave me status calls, arrived on time, and worked diligently for several hours to clean every inch of the sofa--the frame, the upholstery, the cushions. It was not an easy job and I was very impressed with the high level of customer service. Stephen was able to locate the source of the odor and knew exactly what to put on it to extract the doggy smell and replace it with a mountain-dewy scent. He takes his job seriously and stands by his word. I give my highest recommendation and will be calling them again to do my carpets!< /text>

<review>I recently used Easy Clean on the recommendation of a relative, and was extremely pleased.  Our carpet is 14 years old, and has been cleaned twice a year since we put it in, using two other companies.  We thought it was getting time to consider replacing parts of it, because it was just not coming clean anymore, but Marcus spent 3+ hours going over all the worst spots again and again.  It has not looked this good in many years!  He used lots of strong pretreatment, but there is no evidence of soap or chemical residue at all.  Best of all, when I texted him the next day to say there were a few areas that still looked soiled, he was out within a few hours and took care of them to our satisfaction.  That's the mark of excellence to me!< /review>< pictures>

The only set back is that it took forever for everything to dry. He started around 9:30/9:45 am. At 10:00 pm everything was still damp. Just too long for everything to dry. I would use them again but I would have to stay home to keep the doors open and fan blowing to help things dry faster.<//text>< Pics>

{'time': 1522624740312, 'text': 'Hi Deborah,\nGreat to hear Vinnie did an excellent job. That is a longer than usual drying time but sometimes if the carpet has heavier soiling or especially pet related issues it can take a little longer than usual because of the enzyme treatment that continues to work for up to 72 hours. I will remind Vinni to let his customers know of the extended drying time.\nThank you for the four stars and look forward to providing great service in the future!'}< /Response>

We needed a miracle to get these carpets looking great again and we found it in Easy Clean Carpet Care and Scott!

This was almost a 1 Star review that turned into a 5 Star. After making an appointment easily over the phone the day came for our carpets to be cleaned. After no one had showed up I called to find out they never booked us. I was extremely upset but the owner then told me he would have the carpets cleaned at no charge due to his mistake!  Who does that these days?  Our carpet cleaner was Vinny and he was awesome at cleaning our carpets! We went over problem areas and he was able to treat them and get the stains out! Will be using again. Thanks!<//text>

Did an amazing job my carpet looks as close to brand new as it could  :) All the stains are gone. So happy with the service all around from setting the appt and arrival..

Was a great guy he showed up and listened to my comment and problem areas. He gave me a run thru of things that I would need to be done. The carpet had not been cleaned in 5 years and it was in a need of one 3 years ago but just kept putting it off... My carpet had tea, chocolate, pet urine, the normal wear and tear in traffic areas. He used a Carpet pretreatment, Sanitizers, and a enzymes for the urine then to top it off he put down some Soil retardants... i love the carpet i would be glad to have my owners come in and see carpets that look so good... He did give me a discount which i really appreciate . Will be calling to have the carpets cleaned in about one year... hope the carpets is not in such bad shape SCOTT...thank you<//review><gmapID>0x809adfef0fce3f7f:0x29609df9ea8459d<//gmapID><user_name>Patty Nelson< /user_name>< Rating>
