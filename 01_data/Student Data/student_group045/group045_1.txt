<Time>1625264764833<//Time><Review>Customer service was good but the wax itself was bad. The waxer laid it on too thick and let it cool while she looked for the actual wax strip which made it more painful when pulling. It took her a few tries to actually get the wax strip off, at times the wax would be too hot and it burned me. Afterwards I was experiencing a lot of irritation and had redness along with bumps. Not coming back.</Review><userid>103029636030832911243< /userid>< username>

My overall experiences at The Wax Lounge have been awesome. Everyone I've come in contact with is friendly and very helpful in answering any questions. Brandi is my go to person for the Brazilian. She is easy to talk to, makes the process comfortable, gets it done quickly, and of course produces amazing results! This establishment works efficiently to create a pampering ambiance, yet still gets you in and out without waiting around. I definitely recommend The Wax Lounge to anyone interested in these type of services.< /text>

I absolutely love this place . I was introduced to Clara by my sister in law and I will not go with no one else . She does my Brazilian and my brows , she even did a baby  facial for me as well ( which I loved ) but she is letting my brows grow slowly and shaping them wonderfully . What else can I say about my Brazilian except that there is no hair and she is very professional .

I would recommend Clara , she is wonderful and I will continue coming here just for her .< /review>

< review>
1st time customer, made same day appt. i was told id have to put a credit card down. No mention of a cancellation policy. Full disclosure, I was 6 minutes late.  Was called at three minutes late and tersely informed that my appt was being bumped. Not a big deal to be bumped. Rudeness is a big deal. Got there and sat waiting, had a chance to then read their policies.

The store policies are written in an insulting manner. They refer to customers that are even a few minutes late as "flakes", "flakaroonies", and "cornflakes." They specifically state that if you are a flake you probably shouldn't make an appointment with them, that they "don't like flakey people." According to their definition, I was a "flake" and they did not like me. I felt very insulted by this policy. I allotted an appropriate amount of time to travel, but did not realize they were located across train tracks and did not account for being stuck at a train. I didn't mind being bumped as the appointments are very short, but I did not appreciate being labeled by them. I certainly no longer felt comfortable to allow them to wax the most sensitive areas of my body!

I approached the counter and asked to please cancel my appointment, that I no longer felt comfortable. The individual at the counter (the same person who ran my card, it turned out) told me she was sorry I was uncomfortable but could not refund my money. I asked why. She said because I had not canceled 48 hours prior to my appointment. I had made the appointment that same day, literally 2.5 hours prior. There is no way I could have cancelled. She said she would call her manager and then call me later to let me know whether I could have my money back. She said that she could not issue a refund but her manager could. I said this was not acceptable. I asked to speak to the manager. She said I would have to wait about 20 minutes, but could not give me a specific time. I was about to give up in frustration.

The manager, Demi, arrived within about 10 minutes. She was not sympathetic to me not wanting to go through with the service. She made sure to point out that people traveled from all over to have services done. I explained that I did not care about these other people. That I would please like my money back, that as a "flake" I would never bother them by making an appointment there again. She refused. She stated that she had no authority to issue refunds and that I needed to have cancelled 48 hours prior. Again, I do not understand how I could have done that. She said well that's our company policy, which was sent to you in an email. I explained that the email had been sent AFTER they ran my credit card.

Another customer walked in at that point and I could tell the manager did not want them to hear our exchange. She asked me to leave because I was "badgering them". I said I would be happy to leave once I received my refund. The manager refused, saying it would take at least a business day to hear back from corporate. And then, IF they decided to allow me my refund, it would take another week to put the funds back to my card. I asked to speak to someone at corporate. I was denied this. I asked the manager to call corporate. She said they had no phone number. At this point, it was 1:30 pm and I had been trying to get my money back for over 30 minutes. I was extremely upset and baffled by the behavior. I asked if they were on yelp and they said they were. I said I would be leaving a negative review. They didn't seem to care. I finally had no choice but to leave, because I had to get back to work.<//review>

<Review>I will never return to this tire shop again the worst service I have ever received. I needed my two front tires balanced I was asked to park and then they proceeded to assist 4 other customers before I had to go and ask when I would be helped. They finally started my truck, the guy that began didn't even know where to place the jack he had to go ask someone, then after he gets the first wheels off they lean it up against the balancing machine again I'm waiting,  again I had to go ask when they would get to my vehicle. After I asked they started again had to go call another guy cause they didn't know how to use the machine to balance the tires. It took just about an hour to balance two tires and that was only because I questioned the wait if not who knows how long it would have taken, and a little uneasy about the quality of the work after it seemed they weren't trained properly.</Review>< pics>

I had a crazy blowout on the freeway , almost crashed. Found this place online just a mile off the exit.  Here right now getting a set of used tires put on my car. $30 each, balanced, taxes included, out the door price. They were done in 20 minutes! Wow! Fast, affordable, professional. Will be coming back.</text>

<Review>Worst service ever. I went to change my front tires. I called the guy over the phone and asked him for two Yokahama tires. The guy said he has them in stock. Upon arrival, the guy mentioned that he does not have Yokahama. He lied to bring me to the shop. I had to accept buying his chinese brand tires as I really needed them. He installed them and I saw while he is balancing them that he does not even look at the reading of the machine. He took the tire off the balancing machine and I asked him to put it back as I suspect to he did not balance them right. The machine showed the tire is not balanced. The guy does everything half fast crab and does not even know how to use the machine.

After he finished, I took the car and I heard a grinding sound. The unprofessional guy put the balancing weight on the rim where they can hit the dust cover of the brakes. I was sitting inside the car as the guy got a chisel and started removing all the balancing sticker weights off the rim. He thought I am not going to notice. I opened my door and found all weights removed from the tire. I confronted him and he said these weights on the floor are not from my tire. I told him that I just saw him remove them by a Chisel. He wanted to do a half fast job instead of taking off the tire and putting the weights in correct place where they can't grind with the dust cover.

These people do not have integrity. Get yourself away from them. They are corrupt.< /Review>< userid>

<Text>I bought a 12pc front suspension kit online that included lower and upper control arms for my 2003 e320 Mercedes. I took the car to Don Cortez in Fontana and got it all installed for $570.00! The car runs smooth now and I would recommend this shop.</Text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I had went in for a wheel balancing. When I had left my vehicle was still shaking at highway speed‘s. Found out by dealership that The wheels must be balanced dynamically which is weights in the inside and outside.So I went back to the tire shop and spoke with a young guy I believe he is co-owner? And told him to balance the wheels dynamically and he had told me that it cannot be done on the type of rim that I have on my vehicle.So I had left and went to another tire shop across the street and in which they balanced my wheels dynamically with no problem! Which I had to spend more money to have that done. And having my wheels balanced dynamically solved my issues with the car vibrating and shaking at highway speed‘s.So I had gone back and spoke with the same young Guy right after And told him my wheels had been balanced dynamically with no problem and it solved my problem. His response was there wheel balancing machine was not calibrated to do a dynamic balancing only static. I asked for a refund he did not do so. so not only is this guy a thief he is also a liar. These are the kind of places that make you feel like “anybody”can have a tire shop. Once again you get what you pay for! Get quality work done for a couple dollars extra across the street....< /review>

<Review>This is a great shop. I got a flat tire and they were able to get me in and out in less than 15 minutes. Very quick to answer my phone call. Prices were clearly stated. They replaced my flat tire with a used one for only $30. The staff here was very friendly and helpful.</Review><username>Jacob Causey< /username><userid>112458012292899598591< /userid></record></dataset><record>

Good prices on used tires.  I asked for an alignment on my daughter's car.  Well before they did the alignment they thoroughly inspected it and found other issues with it, notified me, showed me and advised me what to do. No pushy mechanic, no lies,  just straight talk and "you tell me what you want."  I loved it! Good,  quick service and very honest.<//Text>

It's a pretty friendly place. I have gone to change my tires from the rims. And I have also gone to take out nails from my tires and have it patched up. I was very satisfied. And it's not high priced.<//text>

<text>Regular tire shop. I give it 3 stars because the used tires they put on my car were pretty good and they didn't take long to put them on. Only things I didn't like is that I was given a different higher price in person than what they had given me when I called.< /text>< resp>

<review>(Translated by Google) I went here in passing two months ago, I am from Los Angeles and I was traveling and spent x here. My truck was 26’s and I bought a new tire at $ 140 that they already had there. As it turns out they put a tire of the wrong size. Just a little smaller. I realized when I went to a planter here in Los Angeles that there was a lot of noise that they had put on me AND THE NUMBERS OF THE TIRE THAT THEY PUTED ME WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TO MY OTHER THREE TIRES. I would like to add the photos but here I can not also add a YELP review on this. They should look better or Alomejor did Aldrede as it arrived a little before they closed.

I was traveling from Los Angeles and passed by this shop to purchase a new tire. I have a truck on 26’s they charged me $ 140 for a tire they had in stock at the store. Well turns out they put the incorrect size tire, just a bit smaller than my original size tires. I went to a shop here in the because it was making noise and confirmed it was the wrong size because of the numbers on the tire COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, I would add the photos but google review doesn’t allow me. I will be adding them on my yelp review. They should be more careful or maybe they even did it on purpose because I showed up like 20-30 before their closing time. I should’ve realized it when I saw how bad they struggled to mount the rim on their tire. Never suggesting this shop to any of my friend out in Fontana !!!!! So irresponsible for them to charge me $ 140 for the wrong size tire especially on 26’s that’s dangerous as hell !!!!!!

Fui aquí de pasada hace dos meses, soy de Los Angeles y andaba de viaje y pase x aquí. Mi troca tenía 26’s compre una llanta nueva en $140 que ya tenían allí. Pues resulta que me pusieron una llanta de el tamaño incorrecto. Solo un poco más pequeña. Me di cuenta cuando fui a una llantera aquí en Los Angeles x que hacia mucho ruido la que ellos me habían puesto Y ME DEMOSTRARON LOS NÚMEROS DE LA LLANTA QUE ELLOS ME PUSIERON ERA COMPLETAMENTE DIFFERENTE A MIS OTRAS TRES LLANTAS.Me gustaría agregar las fotos pero aquí no puedo también agregaré un YELP review sobre esto. Deben de fijarse mejor o Alomejor lo hicieron Aldrede como llege un poco antes que cerraran .

<text>I just moved into a one-bedroom unit just a few days ago and the experience was absolutely great.  The unit is very well maintained and the same can be said about the entire apartment complex.  Matthew is so nice and helpful ever since I first contacted him 3 months ago for a tour.  He is quick to response to all of my questions, and keeps me up to date with all necessary paperwork for a very smooth experience all the way to my move-in day and beyond.  All of the staff seem very friendly, and the apartment complex is nice and quiet.  I’m really looking forward to spending at least the next 2 years here at Fusion Apartments while attending school at U.C. Irvine.</text>< pictures>

< Review>
I want to start off by saying that no matter where you live there will be flaws and while Fusion has definitely had it's fair share of issues, they have overcome most of them and my family can't imagine living anywhere else. I will say the bad reviews you have seen were true but we are also now under new management and it has been nothing but smooth sailing since they took over. Tina especially has gone above and beyond for us.

We have lived here over a year and were first attracted to Fusion for their new furnishings and amazing amenities. We love going to the rooftop to play shuffle board and enjoying sitting by the fire several times a week. We were the first tenants in our specific apartment so everything was new. We love how big the kitchen is and don’t know how we will ever live in a different apartment after this.

One of our favorite things about Fusion is the maintenance team. JoJo is over the top friendly and so helpful, truly one of the kindest men you will ever meet. The whole crew can be seen cleaning every part of the building consistently and thoroughly. I love that they rinse down the courtyards everyday and you never see trash sitting around. It is always so clean.

My wife loves how safe we feel here and how friendly all the neighbors are. While we don’t see everyone the people we do encounter are always cheerful and kind to one another. We truly love living here and don’t plan on going anywhere anytime soon!<//Review>

I’ve been living at fusion for 2.5 years now it's a good place to live. It always clean in common areas, and everywhere else, all the staff treats the apartment complex like their own home and are very welcoming.

When I put in a maintenance request they respond quickly, Joe Joe the maintenance manager and Daniel rock their skilled at what they do.<//review>

Fusion is a great place to live! We have almost lived here two years and it has been pretty nice. Everyone once in a while something is broken but that can happen anywhere. The apartments are nice and new, and especially quiet. The amenities are great when they are open, thanks COVID... The price is reasonable and we aren’t planning on moving anytime soon!</text>

Great location with an awesome view and a great promotion offer during this difficult time. The community and the apartment is much up to date.

Nelly from the leasing office made the tour very quick, easy and safe in the midst of everything going on. Thank you so much for all your help! Amazing customer service!< /Review>

I’ve moved here during November, and it has been a pleasant stay by far. They made the move in as easy as possible and I love the clean amenities that comes along with it. It’s such a safe neighborhood and you don’t really hear traffic noises since it’s in the back side of the road. I love how it’s convenient it is since the 405 freeway is right there, you also have the post office across from the complex, and the best part is the walking distance the DJ plaza. Great experience so far living here!<//Review>

My friend and I took a tour of this Community today & I must say we LOVED it. The gentleman that gave us the tour was an absolute sweetheart!! He made a great 1st impression on this property. I’ve read reviews of residents that absolutely hate management and groundskeepers of these types of communities, but I highly doubt that is the case here. Our tour guide Matthew went above and beyond to make us feel like we were already at home. He answered all of our questions honestly & made the tour of the grounds fun! This community just went to the top of our list because of Matthew... oh and of course because of the amenities and great apartment features.</review>

I've been living at Fusion for the last 6 months and it's been a great experience so far! TLDR: fairly new luxury building + rooftop pool was a big selling point for me and the new staff took over early 2020 so the older reviews may not reflect the current living conditions.

Pros:
- Beautiful amenities that are well maintained (rooftop pool views, grill areas, clubhouse, gym, kids play area, koi pond)
- Attentive, responsive, and friendly management staff (especially Nelly from the Leasing office and Joe Joe / Daniel from Maintenance)
- Newish property (stainless steel appliances, quartz countertops, hardwood floors in main areas, balcony, parking usually on the same floor as unit, minimal noise level from neighbors)
- Convenient location to highways and shopping areas (Costco/Target/supermarkets; walkable to Diamond Jamboree)

Cons:
- Package delivery to the mailroom can be a nightmare with boxes all over the place, making it difficult to locate your packages. There's a locker system (parcel pending) for safety, but lately it hasn't been used and yet it's a $6 monthly charge.
- Guest parking is limited and sometimes spots run out (so people need to find parking off property). Side note: parking garage is tight when turning; at times it can feel unsafe when cars drive too fast or don't use mirrors to watch for others. Oftentimes there are issues with the garage door entrance/exit as well.
- Outdoor noise level from garbage dumpster, landscaping, or dog park from Fusion or nearby properties (but that's typical for any community).

Overall, I am really enjoying my stay at Fusion. It has everything I'm looking for in a building from a luxury/safety standpoint (rent $ is definitely on the higher end, so I'm not sure if I will renewing my lease). Also before you move in, be sure to download the Rentgrata app to chat with current residents for a possible concession bonus towards your rent (and for whoever refers you). Feel free to reach out directly with any questions! :-)<//Text>

This apartment complex is well managed, quiet and has really nice amenities (gym, pool, grills, etc.). I've lived in several different apartments and this is one of the nicest I've been in. They communicate well with residents things that are going on in the community which I appreciate, and the staff is very pleasant. I moved here during the pandemic so I've spent a lot of time at home and have had no issues! Definitely recommend.< /Review>

<Review>I'm impressed with the community in the short time I've lived here. Maintenance is really quick to resolve any issues, which is a big plus. All in all, the community is well maintained and I personally love my unit. Residents keep to themselves (which is perfect), but some drive carelessly coming in and out of the parking structure, so just a word of caution. Location is perfect, though it does get a little noisy with the loading zone, freeways, and airport so close. Improvements like smart locks all around w/app capabilities are highly recommended. Bobby and leasing team were big help moving in, thank you! Can't wait to enjoy the amenities once reopened!

JoJo and Daniel from the maintenance team are incredibly nice and helpful, during and outside of business hours. They’re prompt with their service requests and take the time to explain the issue. It helps a lot that they’re very nice people too!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>I've had a great experience in Fusion Apartments. The maintenance team is amazing. Jojo, the manager of the maintenance team and Daniel, his colleague are the most reliable people. They have great customer service skills. They take care of all my maintenance issues very fast and answer my my questions about the property. They really go above and beyond for tenants. I highly recommend the fusion apartment to anyone.</text>< rating>

I must say that Fusion Apartments is amazing! The area is completely safe and the amenities just highlight a great living experience. A roof top pool, hot tub, gym and club house are perfect for recreation and relaxation. There are dozens of options of markets and stores within a 2 mile radius for all of your day to day needs. Also, The 405 and 5 freeway,  John Wayne Airport, UC Irvine and Irvine Hospital are close by; and OC beaches are only 15 minutes away! The staff here have always been very friendly and very professional! To anyone wishing to live in the Irvine area I highly recommend living at Fusion Apartments.< /text>

<Review>Fusion review
Overall, my husband and I rate our time here at Fusion a 4/5. First off, Maintenance was very quick to respond and friendly. We liked the variety of interesting businesses in close proximity to our apartment. If you’re a couple renting a 1bedroom, however, I would recommend a higher floor-level unit. The additional parking spaces currently reside at the top of the complex only. We were not happy about that since open top parking would leave residue on our cars and the elevator closest to our apartment goes only to the 2nd highest floor. It was not worth paying $100 for an additional outside parking space. (A 2bedroom unit would be an alternative, yet we do not need the additional room). Guest parking was also a problem and rarely available during the weekend. We wished the parking app that administers guest parking alerted you if more than the maximum guest parking capacity is being issued and issuing a guest pass would be at your own risk. The San Diego trail is close if you’re a walker and there’s also a scenic sidewalk route off of Harvard Avenue. Our unit area was quiet for most of our 13-month lease. The bathroom fan is pretty loud and always on, so it takes getting used to. We loved the gas stove and water dispenser in the fridge. Amenities were great but we didn’t get to enjoy them due to the pandemic closure. We would recommend to friends. The main reason for us leaving was parking (scarce guest parking and additional parking space was not in the covered garage).< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1617136784518, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to leave a review of Fusion Apartments.

I wish I could give zero star for this apartment complex. Fusion is cheaply made,  super noisy and most importantly with horrible staff members. I came here because it says “luxury” apartment and the amenities was awesome. But it is anything but luxury. Unfortunately the amenities usually got closed without any reason (not because of covid). If anything happens to the amenities it takes months for them to repair it. Since the apartment is cheaply made it makes it super noisy, literally when your upstairs neighbor walk, you could hear it.
Staff members DO NOT care about tenants at all and they seem to be nice, but when you need them, they are so rude.
The management is so terrible.
You see los of great reviews, just because there is papers all over the place which reward people with  writing reviews.
I don’t recommend this place at all while Irvine has so many mice apartments.<//Text>

<Review>I’m most certainly that their “5 star reviews” are either fake accounts or paid for.  Some of the people who live on the premises are ghetto/sketchy... come to find out there’s some sort of ‘lottery’ for people who can’t afford rent .. which you will be able to tell easily who they are .. the staff is horrid and clearly can care less about the job . Do not sign a long term contract due to you’ll regret it sooner than later .< /Review>< pics>

Ever since we moved here, we've been impressed with all of the amenities and the cleanliness of the whole apartment complex! Fusion apartments is located in probably one of the best locations in Irvine. It's by Jamboree, but not on it, which makes getting out of the complex easy. The leasing office staff was wonderful and extremely helpful. Moving into Fusion was so simple to the point where all necessary utilities were easily accessible from one website. The units in Fusion are so beautiful with modern styling and spacious rooms.

The one thing that sold me was their beautiful koi pond. there are so many amazing koi fish in the pond, and it really sets a soothing mood across the entire apartment complex.

The maintenance/ janitorial staff are wonderful as well, they always manage to keep the apartment clean and tidy. Thanks to the maintenance staff, everything seems to be working properly, and I haven't noticed anything broken within our unit as well as all of the amenities.

Fusion apartments is definitely an apartment worth checking out!</Review>

<review>My advice to anyone searching for a new apartment is to do your research.  There are a lot of options in Irvine/Newport at the same price point with similar amenities.  In my opinion, what sets each apart is their management team.  I did my research and saw a lot of recent positive reviews for the new management team here at Fusion.  They seem to have cleaned up the mess from the last team.  I've been here a few weeks and definitely agree with those reviews.  Bobby from the leasing office is great!  He gave me my tour and guided me through the whole move-in process.  Very easy to work with and helpful with all my questions.  The maintenance guy Jojo is a funny dude as well as being good at his job.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>This is a beautiful property with amazing amenities!

Pros: beautiful fairly new property, gorgeous amenities, very clean, well maintained, staff can be very accommodating when needed!

Cons: no one ever picks up the phone in the leasing office, your trash utility bill will be different each month based on usage of the community, and guest parking is very limited.

Overall, a lovely place to call home. This management company took over March 2020 and it seems they are figuring things out and doing the best they can!!<//text>< user_name>

<Text>My wife and I moved to Fusion in early 2019, and the living experience here is truly amazing.

- Location: incredibly convenient! Diamond Jamboree is just across the street with all kinds of authentic Asian food! Multiple grocery stores & Costco within 5 minutes of driving. Plus the San Diego Creek next door is just the perfect running spot!

- Management: very responsive and helpful. Had couple of issues lately and Bob’s always helped  figuring it out right away!

- Amenity: pretty standard amenity for a decent apartment complex, gym, clubhouse, grill, etc. Best part is the rooftop pool & jacuzzi, amazing view!

- Noise: this is my top concern when I’m looking for new places. Thankfully Fusion’s noise cancelling is very good. We can rarely heard any noise from the neighbors, and when closes off the windows there isn’t much noise from the street either (windows are noise cancelling). Very, very peaceful & quiet community.

- Parking: one of the few downsides of Fusion. Not many guest parking spot, plus the gate is always broken for some reason.

- Safety: probably one of the safest neighborhoods I’ve ever lived in, never had any issue with security.

Not sure why the Google/ Yelp ratings are on the lower side, to be honest other than a few minor issues that you’ll experience in pretty much any apartment complex, we really enjoyed living here. Highly recommend<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I am loving the apartment. The rooftop pool is amazing, I feel like I am on vacation. The building is new and modern. The maintenance team are prompt to responding to your enquiry. Great location. Parking is convenient and on the same floor to your apartment. Community is a good mix. Only downfalls are the lack of guest parking (which I feel is standard for some apartments in OC) and it can sometimes take a while to get hold of the leasing office as they're so busy - but they do eventually get back to you! Other than that, I do thank the leasing office and to Bobby for securing the apartment for me!</Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Moved in during the pandemic
Even with the craziness it was a pleasant experience
The staff is amazing and even the maintenance staff
Everyone had been super friendly and have gone above And beyond
Renting from a home to an apartment style living has not been a easy transition but due to the amazing staff
I’m super glad I chose fusion
The amenities are beautiful
And the space is more than others ive seen
Everyone’s friendly from what I have encountered
And it’s super close to everything (shopping, Grocery, minutes from nightlife)
I would recommend fusion anytime
I have not had one negative experience here
And I’m one of those residents that call for a lot but they have always been there to guide me
Emails me very quickly if I have any questions
And maintenance is always super quick if needed< /Review>< pics>

I’ve been stayed here for 3months so far. Think I’m qualified to come here leave a review This community is quiet, and my neighbors are all really nice people. To be honest, I’ve checked many apartments, but Fusion is the only place has the floor plan I wanted, the maintenance service is always quick and easy. and they even wash the floor and the trash room every week. Living here you don’t have to worry about cold water during the shower, bad refrigerator. Where else you can go?<//text>

Pretty apartment complex with great amenities (once it's open again of course :)) like a salt water pool, game room, BBQ, and fire pits.  The building is well located as it's a mere walk away from Diamond Jamboree, so a big plus.  Nice and friendly staff too!

The units itself are large and modern.  However, I absolutely despise the dishwashing unit, it's like the most basic model you can imagine.  It boggles the mind how such a luxury building would choose the most basic dishwasher.  Anyways, other than that, pretty sweet building.<//text>

I've lived in a few different communities in Irvine and this is by far my favorite. The complex is kept very clean and the staff is always friendly and helpful. The rooftop amenities are awesome and the pool is soooo pretty! Great place to live with kids and pets! Highly recommend.<//Review>

I love living here! Everything is so nice. The building was made with good quality materials so it’s quiet. You just hear a normal amount of noise not like a stampede of elephants like at any Irvine Company apartment. They are quick to respond to issues and are usually ahead of it. I really appreciate all of the office and maintenance staff always being on top of everything!<//review>

<review>I have been living here for 2 years now. I paid rent the entire first portion of the Pandemic every single month. I paid my rent in full even though I was out of work since March 13 2020. I used all my savings to pay my rent in full. I paid March through August 2020 in full every month and also on time. After August they presented me with a raised amount of rent for a shorter lease as my lease was up. I begged the company and the management to please give me a shorter lease at the same rate, they refused. I told them my situation with my job and they did not care. They still raised my rent the legal amount (which they legally could). Idk why they felt the need to raise my rent when they knew my work situation. I then was strong armed into signing a 11 month lease to not have the rent raised more, as I could not afford it. I have signed the declaration of not working and being affected by the pandemic ever single month & they still add on the legal amount of late fees every single month KNOWING MY SITUATION. This company does not care about people and does not care about the tenants and our financial situations due to the Corona Virus Pandemic. I wanted to move in August as I feel I was unfairly treated by the management during the first portion of the pandemic. I could not move due to not having enough money and resources to move. I am terribly disappointed in this company and the management here. They are rude and unhelpful. I can't wait to get out of this apartment I would not recommend moving here. The best part of this community is the Amenities which I have not been able to use basically at all the past year because of the Corona Virus Pandemic. I still don't understand after me sending emails and speaking with management why they would raise my rent and force me to sign a longer lease than what I felt comfortable signing (knowing I was not working). They truly DO NOT CARE. This is by far one of the worst experiences I have ever had living at an apartment. I didn't want to have to leave this review but they have left me no choice. Horrible company & worse mangament. The gate never works so there is basically no protection or safety here. The gate has been broken way more than it has worked in the two years I have been here. The call box never works. Anytime you order food you will have to go down to get it because they gate is always broken and the call box is always broken. Due to the gate constantly being broken I have had the same random kids knock on my door trying to sell different things. The same group of kids soliciting a newspaper and asking for my credit card info have literally come to my door 5 times during my stay here. Once it made me so uncomfortable and scared because they came by around 9 pm, so I was forced to call the Irvine Police Department & they sent an officer here. The parking structure is in the middle of the complex and there's hardly any room for 2 cars. I almost get hit daily by other people driving. The whole complex was made incorrectly & odd. I live on the 5th floor and I had to throw all my plants away because there's no proper drain and the drain water will just fall to the neighbors balcony. It is a mess. It’s also very very loud as the post office is across the street & a furniture model store is right next to it which puts furniture together all day. On the other side of the apartment there is a church which is very loud as well. They blast worship music which I don’t mind but I find it wild how loud this place is. The mail room is a disaster always & I lose packages left & right! The only good thing I can say about this apartment complex is that they do keep it clean and the maintenance workers do a great job!< /review>< pics>

Beautiful units and amenities. I’ve been here for 1.5 years now and aside from a few minor issues with the garage gate or call box every now and then, the property has always been very well managed in terms of cleanliness, amenity maintenance and safety. The technicians have always been on top of their game whenever I’ve had an issue - Just last Saturday I was in a bit of a rush for a dinner reservation and ended up breaking my key off in the front door lock. Called the emergency (after hours) line and within 15 minutes, the technician  Daniel was there to resolve the issue, allowing us to be on time for our last dinner out before the latest iteration of covid restrictions went into effect. Gg Daniel!</review>

I moved in August of 2020 - Bobby from the leasing office and the maintenance staff went above and beyond to create a smooth transition for me with the move in. Since moving in, I have nothing, but great things to say about the apartment I'm living in (love the studio!) as well as leasing office personnel and maint crews.

1/29/21 - It’s been ~5-6 months since moving in. I have nothing but great things to say about living in this apartment complex. Close to some of my favorite places, close to 405 and toll for work, close to parks and running paths, quiet living, friendly staff, dog friendly, nice apt interior, and great amenities. Only wish is for the rooftop pool / spa to be open until midnight instead of 10 PM. Even that is more of a want, not a must have. It’s been a great community to live in!</review>

<Review>Jojo is a great help. His response time is within minutes even if he’s busy with a project. He has always gone out of his way to help me out.

Parking since the new management has arrived is quite annoying. Paying $4/day for guest spots over an app is just annoying.

<review>we have checked out several apartments around the area. Initially, we were little hesitate to choose Fusion after we saw the reviews @google and yelp.  After checking it out with our own eyes, we found the apt and amenity here is really nice and clean, and the new mgmt. team is very friendly and professional.   We were in hurry to move-in to our new apt, and thanks to Bobby who made it happen in a very short time frame.  He was very patient to all our questions and helped us out through the move-in process. Now we have been in our new apt for 1 week, and we kinda enjoy living here< /review>< Response>

Fire alarm in this apartment is a complete nightmare....You never know when it will happen but usually it is when you are sleeping. I guess the design is defective, because every time the fire alarm goes, you can hear the whole system of the apartment are running(usually it should be separate). Also, the alarm stands really long, usually about 20-30 minutes with discountiniuity.<//text>

<review>The apartment is good. The rent does not include any service to receive packages and does not include the 'Parcel pending' service. It costs about $8 a month and I already pay for a bunch of things I do not use - pool, barbecues, trash etc. But if you do not subscribe to it, be ready to be on the phone for an hour to get your FedEx packages coz you'd call the service and leasing office about two times each to get the delivery. Extremely annoying in an otherwise good apartment.<//review><resp>{'time': 1597699390031, 'text': "Hey there, Hari! Thanks so much for sharing your feedback on our package service.

< Review>
Worst apartment Ive ever lived at. I signed the contract and payed the down payment. On move in date, they gave us the wrong door and said that the one we wanted is already rented out to someone else. They didn't apologize or even care. All they said was well this is all we have right now. BAD! we spent a long time finding the perfect one we want and they just give it to someone else without even letting us know. Even though we had already gave in the money first. WHO DOES THAT? and the alarm is always turning off for hours during the middle of the night. Im telling you, you will regret it once you give them your money. They don't often take out the trash either. So a lot fo the trash will end up piling up for the longest time ever and the whole floor that you live at will smell like garbage. So unlucky to move to this apartment.<//Review>

The problems are included but not limited to:
- the packages get lost
- there is no pest control within the units and in the common area

Today was my 5th time visiting this location.. usually they're pretty efficient.
I think today they could have used another person.
I waited longer than usual for my drink.
Not a huge deal.
Just think they could have used an extra set of hands.</Text>

<text>Nuh-uh. Not this Starbucks. I'm sorry, but just, NOPE.

I was so excited when it first opened up. The other Starbucks was half hour walk away. When you have no car to drive, and when you love Starbucks as much as me, you'll understand how excited I was.

However, the drinks were just awful! Maybe it's because the staffs are all new? First, they gave me extra ice when I asked for light ice. I asked them to change it, but they just scooped out all the ice, and left the rest of the cup empty. They offered an explanation before I could point out the empty space. "Sorry, if I add more milk, it'll taste bad." Okay, fine, I'll just drink my half cup of mocha when I payed for the price of one.

Few days later, a friend asked me to bring her a cup of latte macchiato. I also got myself a cup of the mango dragonfruit drink. When she got her drink, it just tasted like heavy creamer and milk. There was absolutely no flavor in it other wise. Sadly, we had to throw the whole cup away. I drank my mango dragonfruit, but it was very watered down, and I think they forgot about the mango syrup...

Few months later (a week or two weeks ago), I thought they had enough time to learn, so I went and visited again. I got myself a cup of white chocolate mocha. Ugh... It looked just like milk (yes, pain white), and taste just like milk.... I asked the server about it, and she kindly remade my drink. "With extra pump of white mocha," she says. Only, this time it was so sweet, the mocha and chocolate flavor was way too much. Well, it's better than the milk...

It's going to be another few months before I come back. Hopefully, they'll be real Starbucks by then... Hopefully...< /text>< Gmap_id>

(Translated by Google) Starbucks here is high on the ceiling of the triangular window, so it is decided to be full of space. The seat is full and not crowded. The staff is clean and the environment is clean. I am very cold and feel good.

I dined at Pozzetto yesterday and I have to say they have absolutely the best Chicken Alfredo I have ever eaten outside of Italy. The sauce is made on site and is fabulous. If I lived closer I would dine there all the time. The service was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable for what you get. I highly recommend this place if you like authentic Italian food.</Text>

My brother ordered lasagna, and they said they were out which seems odd to me at an Italian restaurant, so he ordered something else instead. A couple at the next table who came in after us ordered and had their food delivered before they told my brother that the second thing he ordered was also not available. I know most restaurants are struggling with Covid issues but Iittle inexpensive things like cleaning the caked-on oils on the light switches would give customers a more positive experience.< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>I really enjoyed this place and will be coming back again. Very nice customer service and has been one of the best Italian food places I have ever ate at. Every bite was as delicious as the first.Definitely worth a stop and it’s nice to support businesses during this time and if your going to do so I recommend supporting them.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

WONDERFUL. I was just working for UberEats , being a delivery driver , yaknow. They were closed but I got an order for pickup there , so I called and they said I could still pick it up. And basically long story short , the very sweet person whom I assume is the owner ? well she gave me the order for the customer and handed me another bag and said “this is for you” I was super surprised ! I asked her if it’s vegetarian (because I am , duh.) and she said yes because it’s some minestrone soup and garlic bread. (: and I don’t know if it’s because I hadn’t eaten yet or her kindness just made the food taste that much better , but it was AMAZING. not only did it warm my mouth and body , but my heart and SOUL. ahhh that warm soup and garlic bread were amazing beyond anything I’ve had in a while. amazing staff and beyond great food !¡< /review>

First time eating here and it was absolutely delicious!!! Ordered for 4 of us... Meatball sandwich, chicken Parmesana sandwich, Italian Sandwich, and anti-pasta salad. All was absolutely perfect (DARN! Forgot to take pics!)! Good sized portions, lots of meat and cheese on the salad, meaty and cheesy sandwiches. Oh! And perfectly seasoned marinara! OMG!!! So looking forward to our next meal! Will definitely be back in 2 weeks!!! Thank you!!! I hate wasting my money on terrible food and I definitely felt like it was money well spent.❤❤❤❤❤<//Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x80c32f162a7b861f:0xfb5506056b5f6617<//Gmap_id><Review>I had an absolutely terrible experience with this restaurant yesterday.  We placed an order for delivery through Postmates and after nearly an hour and a half, I called the restaurant to see what was going on.  The Postmates app still said the food was being prepared.  The owner of the restaurant (I'm pretty sure) told me that the food was picked up 30 minutes ago and he had since had two additional drivers stop to pick up since then.  It was very clear already at that point that he gave my food to someone who stole the food (that's what I would call it since they never delivered it to me).  The restaurant said there was nothing he could do about it and he refused to remake the food and said I would have to contact to resolve the issue.  So I was out $65 and no food.  I couldn't believe the restaurant was more concerned about their revenue loss than making a customer happy, especially when this clearly was not my fault.  The restaurant clearly did not do a good job verifying that the person picking up my order was legit and apparently in their mind this was my problem.  At one point a fourth driver came to get my food and the restaurant called me and put the driver on the phone.  Mind you this person had nothing to do with the situation, but he apologized repeatedly.  The nerve of the restaurant to put a random person on the phone that had nothing to do with the problem was unbelievable.

Pozzetto could have worked with me to make sure I got the food I ordered and then we could have worked out the money to make sure he was paid.  Instead they were jerks about it.  I will not be going back to Pozzettos ever again. Mistakes happen, I get it, but they were jerks and their are far too many good italian restaurants nearby to waste my time and money with one that isn't to treat their customers appropriately.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><user_id>118101592029410729623< /user_id><date>1617724925141<//date>< user_name>

I ate spaghetti from there via Door Dash and it tasted like they dumped an entire container of salt in to the sauce. I ended up throwing it in the garbage. I hate that I had to even give them one star.< /text>

The staff is wonderful the place is cute but the food is not good. We had 4 different pasta dishes and none of them good. Very disappointing I read all the reviews before going and people's taste buds are broken or the were paid to write a good review.<//review>< Rate>

One of the best (in my opinion) Italian food places in the area. The staff/owners are always willing to go above and beyond to make sure you're satisfied. The food is always delicious and the atmosphere is always good for a romantic vibe or casual date. It may not be "authentic" but you will not be disappointed.</Review>

<Text>What a treasure. 15 years of family owned delicious. Feels like fine dining inside, romantic, if cozy, atmosphere. The pizza was perfect, the lasagna was delicious. The lasagna came with salad and bread.
I got there a little early and the game me bowl of minestrone for free! Also really good and peppery. I should have gotten pictures but we are them too quickly.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c32f162a7b861f:0xfb5506056b5f6617<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The food was amazing and so was the wine, the owner picked the wine for us based off of what we said we liked and it was amazing!! The food and bread followed suit we could tell it was all made fresh. We were checked on and made to feel at home I would come back here every week if we lived close by! This place is a treasure! The owner is absolutely amazing I couldn’t say enough about how much we loved this place!!< /review>< Pictures>

<Review>I absolutely  love the food here. Even BETTER than the food is the service they provide. The owner is a true honest businessman  that really cares about his customers. If you haven't tried this place you must! They have a great house cabernet too!<//Review><rate>5< /rate><Date>1578784801006< /Date><name>Nicole Aragon</name>< userid>

< Review>
Since taking a trip to Italy last year, this is hands down our favorite Italian restaurant in the states. We travel for a living, so we basically eat our way around the world. When Yelpers said to come to this little place just 5 minutes from where we were staying in San Dimas, we were a bit skeptical, but, Yelpers are always right!

This is Italian to the Nth degree. This is NOT fast food. There are like 3 entire people employed here. It's all fresh made, so relax, get some wine and chill out while they make you some food to remember!

We've now been here twice, and have also ordered delivery from Uber Eats. My hands down fav every time is the Chicken Tequila!!! The Chef/Owner (who is the sweetest thing ever) recommended it on our first visit and he basically insisted, so I ordered it. He asked if I like spicy. That's not normally a question you get at an Italian restaurant. I responded that I sure do. He asked "How hot?" I said "7 out of 10?" Well, apparently this fella makes his own hot sauce! He doctored up my Chicken Tequila and DAYUM it was GOOOOOD! I've since gottent hat dish 2 more times. Can't get away from it now. I crave it non stop.

The BF has gotten the Sausage and Peppers (a fav). Veal Marsala (was "bleeping amazing") and then Veal Parm. I also got the Shrimp Bistro once, which was good, but no Chicken Tequila!

Also, the first time we went, we ordered their wine, but then we learned you can BRING YOUR OWN! They'll cork it for $9.99. Awesome!

All in all, we won't be back to CA for 8 months, but I can already SMELL that Chicken Tequila!!<//Review>

<Text>Tonight was the first time we tried it and were more than pleasantly surprised. I had the lite spaghetti and the waiter was upbeat and fun with his "how lite would you like it?" line. Friendly service and my order was amazing. It was made with fresh ingredients, not overcooked and had wonderful flavor. Our vegetarian son was impressed with the Eggplant Parmesan, and my husband had a thick crust pizza that was crispy and not soggy. All the food was made to order. We will be coming back and inviting other friends as well. Kudos, Pozzetto. You've won us over!<//Text><Response>None<//Response><pictures>None<//pictures>< gmap_id>

I love it when I find something special to tell you about...Owner Jack created a 5☆+Birthday Dinner of over-the-top deliciousness. It sparkles in my mind as one of my best meals ever.
It took me 3 years to finally get here...(that's sad) all 3 of us had the treat of our lives with food from a "Master Chef's hands."
The attention to detail was remarkable. Starting with the salad of hand picked and torn greens. Fresh beyond belief. 5☆'s!
Next...bread baked fresh daily...and topped with 2 cheeses that blend beautifully. 5☆'s+ (I pigged out...I don't eat bread!)
Wine from Italy that was like sipping satin...paired beautifully with the meal. 5☆'s!
Service...5☆'s, (included a greet from his lovely wife)
And...just the right amount of everything. (I got so full on the bread)...I had the take-homes for lunch. Equally brilliant. (My mouth is watering just thinking about it.) Each of the three meals were  perfectly done. We couldn't choose our favorite.
To top it off...Jack baked a cheesecake with a mouthwatering sauce for my Birthday cake. Wow! is all I can say.
Every bite we ate was...well, this one you just have to taste for yourselves.
Hope you enjoy as much as I did...
On my Top 10 Best Restaurants List! (With pleasure...)< /text>

Service is very good, the food is made fresh and to order, recently remodelled the interior (looks great and very comfortable). A hidden gem in the San Gabriel Valley. In my opinion the best Italian restaurant in the valley.< /Review>

Pozzetto was the culinary highlight of my family's SoCal vacation. We originally found it just by searching for food close to the freeway along our route back from San Diego, but it simply blew us away. Our food was the best Italian food I've had in years. The restaurant was nice and clean, as well as upscale yet accommodating.  The staff was warm, friendly, and attentive: so much so that they picked a wine for my wife off of just reading her that went off as a huge success (she bought a bottle to go lol.)

My only drawback is that Pozzetto is 5 hours away from where we live in the Bay Area. That's not their fault, but we'll certainly make the trek out to San Dimas specifically to revisit this restaurant whenever we are going to SoCal in the future!<//text>

<review>Called in an order, staff was very busy but polite. Picked up my order and they apologized repeatedly for being short over the phone, which wasn't necessary but appreciated. Got home with the food and WOW! AMAZING! Excellent quality, authentic Italian food! Can't wait to eat there again!</review>< pictures>

Good Italian food, comfortable restaurant, ample parking in the rear. The chef mixed up my order but corrected it immediately. Also, the meatballs are very large! I was crazy to think I could eat two of them!<//Text>

The food is not bad...actually you can say it is good. But the service is really bad. As an Italian restaurant, the servant let my water glass empty more than 30 minutes without even one refill. The table is not cleaned up until 10 minutes after we finished the appetizer. The service looks like better for old customer but bad to new comer.
Not suggest to New Asian customers to try<//review>

<Review>A favorite restaurant in my family, Pozetto's is a nice Italian restaurant that fits well in Old Town San Dimas. All of the food is delicious, but by far Pozetto's has THE BEST pizza crust. The pizzas have just the right amount of sauce and cheese.</Review>< pictures>

Owner or manager lacks people skills. He and his waitress were not friendly and attentive at all. Missed ingredient on pizza. Unwelcome to children. No napkins and silverware offered to them. Had to ask halfway through meal.  Bread for soup was brought until we were almost done with it. When I asked for pizza plates,the five plate pile  was given to me impatiently while I am holding a sleeping baby on one arm. Parmesan cheese was offered until we were almost done eating. The Parmesan was tasteless, might as well eat shredded cardboard. The Coup de gras, they accidentally dropped a knife and fork within an inch of my sleeping baby's head and my leg. Not planning on returning<//Text>

Food was bland and honestly tasted like it was frozen. My friend's variety platter was overcooked and just dumped on the plate. Service wasn't great either and the owner/manager whoever he was touched my shoulder.<//text>

It’s a nice, usually quiet skate park. It’s kept up pretty well, has a lot of room for multiple skaters to share, and is conveniently located within eyesight of an emergency room!</Review>

This Kaiser is awesome everytime I had came for a doctor visit or my son. The Doctor care, very friendly staff, place is always clean. And the ER very fast service the most I had waited was an hour there. Which is not bad.< /review>

Nice park but there were vagrants loitering right next to the playground. They may have been perfectly harmless individuals but it doesn't put a mom's heart at ease when you're there with small children.< /text>

<date>1517812253698< /date><Review>Took my son here to play and there was broken glass on every table. The water fountains are filthy and garbage was overflowing on to the ground. Kids be damned, seems like the place caters to the 30 something year old burnout yelling at his mom on his flip phone to pick him up because he was done skating for the day.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Text>Sad to be disappointed. Got pan fried shrimp and glass noodle salad vegetarian style at this place. While the shrimp was quite alright, the noodle salad... how do I put it... wasn’t according to the recipe. Maybe the noodles were stored together with chicken, I don’t know, they tasted weird like as if they had fish sauce in them. Blandly boiled veggies and somewhat withered lettuce accompanied the weird tasting noodles. I make that salad at home, so I know it gotta taste and look completely different. Had to toss the whole plate minus some cashews from the top.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Quality of the food is spotty. Some things are excellent while others are terrible. We got Bangkok City Chicken and it was inedible. Didn't realize it till we had already brought it all home. It was dry, like jerky. It clearly had been cooked before the day we got it and then somewhat reheated and given to us. I would have rather just contacted them via email and let them know that, but there is no email address on their website. From reading other reviews, I felt calling in and making my concern known would not have resulted in a positive outcome.< /text>

<review>If I could give zero stars I would. I ordered vegetable soup, which clearly says online VEGETARIAN style. It is made with chicken stock. I am vegetarian and got very sick. I called in to discuss this and was brushed off and treated very poorly. Would not recommend.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Extremely disappointing. The fresh rolls consisted of spring mix, carrot and tofu. The Chandara Thai menu lists them as having alfalfa sprout, mint and cilantro. None of the six we ordered had these ingredients. These are common ingredients in fresh rolls at every Thai restaurant I have ever visited.

We also ordered the Pad Kee Mao. It was one of the few items on the menu that was free of animal sourced ingredients. However, it tasted suspiciously of chicken.

I will not be returning. If you want good Thai food  Panoy Bistro, Taste of Thai and Sopa Thai are a far better choice.< /review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<review>First time eating at this establishment. Very nice decor and abiance. Servers were very friendly. I would have given them 4 stars, however, I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai, which was great and would have been better if the tails had been removed from the shrimp. I do not understand cooks who do not remove the tails from shrimp when cooked in dishes. If it were prawns or shrimp cocktail it would be acceptable, but it's not acceptable when cooked in a dish. I will go back though.</review>< pics>

<Review>We really like this place. It was very nice inside kind of upscale but quiet environment. I like the way their menu was laid out, prices were reasonable, and most importantly the food was excellent!

A major consideration for us as well is location. Much easier to park and get in and out of than the Thai places in downtown Grass Valley and Nevada City.

We will absolutely be returning in the near future.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<text>I have never revised a review of a place, but I am now. I hate to say it but Chandara has been slowly going downhill. Below average phad thai and rard nah,  confusion as to which dish had which meat or was suppose to be just vegetables. Plus the spice levels have now become very hit or miss.  This used to be good, but not so much anymore these last few months.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x809b712d57be9c3f:0x97455465f8aba0cc<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Extremely disappointing experience. My family has spoken highly of their food.

Walked in 35-40 minutes before they closed at 3pm on Father's day. Not an extremely long time before they close, but long enough we won't take up too much time if a little later than 3 exactly. I was seated directly next to the door and the rest of the party came in shortly after me (4 total). Took multiple minutes to receive a menu and spent a couple looking over the large variety of option.  After 5 plus minutes in restaurant, last 2 of party return from restroom and server comes and asks if we are ready to order. In the middle of ordering appetizers, the server makes it clear we have to eat our order and leave by 3pm and cannot stay any later to finish up our lunch. Given that this was over 30 minutes before their posted close time, and the server waited until we had been seat and picked our food, and only then decided to tell us we have to rush our lunch and be out of there by 3. If we had been politely told they are trying to close at exactly 3 and at least been greeted with a smile and courtesy that would have been accepted. But with the rude and inconsiderate manner in which we were treated, I guess I'll never know how good their food might have been.<//review>

<Review>Not as bad as people were saying on Yelp. Mood lighting was a bit off. We had ribs and noodles which were really good! Poor waitress looked like she was nervous 😫 I'm gunna assume she was the one who got blasted on Yelp. She was friendly and sweet and the only on waiting tables.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<user>112550694842085871849</user><review>Always spicey at Chandara! Got met with a little apprehension walking thru the door with 9 people and no reservations but as dinner got underway our presence was more warmly welcomed.
No "birthday desserts" we were told. Ordered fried banana with Coconut ice cream, not bad :)
Order light as entre portions are large, and spices are Thai spicey not American.
Ordered drunken noodles last time, spicey. They were almost to much... almost.
Father in-law got regular and said they were HOT! Very quiet the 3 times I have been here and there always seems to be a good bit of room for seating. Relatively new restaurant in town (September 2018) still seems to be finding its footing but the food is VERY solid and I will be back.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>This was not only the worst thai food I have ever had,  it was the worst food I have ever ordered from a restaurant in my entire life. My food was over salted to the point of being inedible and had none of the characteristics of the very common Thai dish I ordered other than it contained beef. The water was also very bad. It was either very heavily chlorinated or both of the glasses at my table had large amounts of dish detergent residue. I recommend drinking beer instead,  as it will come in a bottle and remove Chandara from the entire equation. You will also appreciate the alcohol as your outing at this awful restaurant continues.

My server wasn't nearly as terrible as my food was, but how the restaurant responded when I sent my food back was awkward, unprofessional, rude and brief.

In short, I cannot recommend Chandara in any way. It wasn't just bad Thai food like panda express is bad Chinese food, it was bad food in general. Chandara should immediately clean house and get new cooks, and possibly a new dishwasher.

-edit-
I thought I should mention that I have never posted a review on Google before, but my experience at Chandara was so terrible I decided I should warn everybody. Nobody deserves 5 top ramen flavor packets masquerading as thai food.<//Review></record>

<review>ordered to go - ordered mixed seafood soup (most expensive soup on menu)and it had old shrimp that was on the cusp of bad- overall meal was pretty disappointing-had been in once before a couple months ago and it was good- turned us off to go back-even the rice was old and starchy< /review>< pictures>

Literally the best ever. Took probably 5 minutes and $40 for a brand new tire. Amazing !!!!! For the exact same tire just a few months before it was almost $200 at another shop. Will only go here from now on!<//text>

Fast service with a price that is very affordable if not competitive. Their service took 20 minutes to finish all 4 tires taken out, fitted, balanced and put back on. I Highly recommend this place even if they don't smile as much 😂< /review>

So I was calling different tire shops in Vacaville for the cost of mounting 4 new tires I bought on line. The average price was between $100 to $200.  $200 was from Les Schwab which I thought was way too much until I called this place, the guy I spoke to told me it would cost me $525.  He had a accent so maybe I misunderstood him so I kindly asked him again how much? and he slowly says $525 for mounting and balance. I couldn’t believe why they charge sooo much??? So I  said ok thank you and without a single word he just hangs up. Big time RED FLAG!!!< /text>

We were on our way to the airport and we started to feel a vibration and thought we smelled something burning.  We stopped at the Vacaville Tire Shop and they put on rotors and pads and new tires in about an hour.  We might be a little later to the airport than we planned but I think we'll make our flight thanks to them!!<//review>

<Review>This place doesn't deserve one star.  I went there today with a nail in my tire.  The guy came out and took the tire off without saying a word.  I had to ask if he found the nail and he said yes.  Then he was back within a couple minutes and put the tire back on (big red flag).  I had to ask if he patched it and he said ,Yes, it will last a long time."  Charged me $10 and didn't give me a receipt and went and sat in a chair and put his feet up.  I went to the Nut Tree and shopped for a couple hours and came out and the tire was flat again.  Limped to Firestone and they were AWESOME!  They said Vacaville Tire Shop didn't fix it at all.  Not even with a piece of gum!  If I would have gotten on the freeway the tire would have blown immediately.  PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS SHOP IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR LIFE!!!< /Review>< pics>

Having frequented used tire shops in neighboring towns... this one's pretty substandard. no greeting, just "new or used? How many? Park your car here". I was ignored for a few minutes. I was the only customer. The technician took one tire off my car, (getting 4 changed) was distracted by what I'm guessing was a colleague, speaking in a language I'm not familiar with, (I'm an ignorant mono lingual American for the record, I'm not insulting them) then he quietly dissappeared for a half hour. I finally went looking for him. He was in office eating, perhaps for lunch, idk, just seems wierd, like he forgot I was here. Judge Judy was on in the shop, it was pretty sub standard. Better than having your tires blow out at 70 mph I guess, but damn. I'll be looking elsewhere, next time for this service.< /text>

<Text>This place is absolutely horrible. I called and asked if they had the used tire I needed and they said yes without hesitation. When I showed up the employee at the desk said they didn't have it and tried to get me to buy a new one. He also pointed at the other employee and blamed him for the misinformation. Aegean tire shop is where I ended up...they had the tire they said they had and were professional about it.</Text>< pictures>

<UserId.>107462665558974029669< /UserId.><Review>Good prices I didn't go there to shop for groceries. Even if I was traveling I would try to have water and something to eat. Yes I might run out of water so if a gas station has gas drinking water air and water for my car AND A CLEAN SAFE REST ROOM I AM HAPPY. THIS STATION FIT THE BILL ON EVERYTHING IT COULD. ANOTHER GUIDES COMMENT MAKES ME WANT TO SAY WHEN YOU Are Traveling BE AWARE. OF YOUR Surrounding's. A HOOD FRIEND OF Mine Was ROBBED AT A GAS Station. When traveling  or commuting. Try to start looking for had before you are too low on fuel.If after looking around the gas station you don't feel safe go somewhere else. Always look around  before getting out of your car. It's not worth saving a couple of dollars to put you or your passengers at risk.this ARCO station might have undesirable element around at night. Richmond can be tough at night. So be cautious always at every gas station !</Review>< time>

(Translated by Google) I have been going for months and those machines do not fix them from outside they never pass my cards I have to go inside and let them know and they ignore me every time I have told them and the cashier is like I do not hear very badly what is the service point of having afura machines to pay

The drinks are creative, delicious, and beautiful. The short rib sandwich is flavorful and tender. I ordered it with fries.  The fries were a very generous portion. Menu is on a QR code so bring your charged mobile device. I had a problem with my signal and it took a really long time to load the menu. It would be nice if they posted the menu in the window so people could take a picture of it if they can't download it. I appreciated the heat lamps for outdoor seating.</Text>

<Review>They have outdoor dining that fills up pretty quickly so get here early! The wings were a good appetizer, cooked just right. My friend really enjoyed his meatloaf while my fried chicken was super juicy and breaded lightly. The service was also quick and friendly. My only complaint is that the cocktails were super tiny and even so, were not filled up all the way. I felt bad but I should have sent back two of the cocktails we got since they were barely half full (already tiny glass).</Review><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Imagine biting into a caramel covered apple only to discover that it is actually an onion.

Overpriced cafeteria food.

The place has a nice and laid back ambience that lulls you into believing that you are in for a gastronomically satisfying experience.

There is a marked gap between the price of the menu items and what actually arrives in front of you.

To be fair, the Brussel sprouts were good, albeit slightly over cooked.

The entree's are a different story. If you were out for dinner to satisfy your hunger, you will be gravely disappointed.
You would literally have better food out of a vending machine.

I recommend having an actual meal before eating here so that the disappointing food would be less of a heartbreak once it touches your poor unsuspecting tastebuds.

The drinks were good but the alcohol was not enough to mask the unfortunate tasting food.

If you want good food, go elsewhere.

If you want to get drunk in a pretentious ambiance, this is the place to be.

It's better off marketed as a bar that serves food, that way you know up front that it's a place to drink, not to eat at.< /review>

Food was very good, out side service only but they have heaters over some tables. Very extensive and eclectic cocktail menu. Service friendly. 5 stars, but I did note that all items I had tasted had more salt than I expected, but still tasted good.</review>

This restaurant is opened by the same people that started Fiorella's. The food is great, staff are friendly and attentive, lively atmosphere. The noise level is medium, you do have to raise your voice at bit to have conversation. I recommend going with a few friends and sharing plates.<//Review>

They've succeeded in making a hip bar/restaurant in the Outer Richmond, but the service is lacking, the food is overpriced, and it's really cramped.

We showed up on time for a 7:30 reservation and were in line to check in. Just as we were about to check in, a woman pushed past us and asked to be seated. The host stand is in a really unfortunate place, so perhaps she didn't notice that we were standing in line. We were seated right after, so it didn't seem like a big deal. BUT... after being seated, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to even be greeted by a waiter. It was so long, in fact, that the woman who'd cut us in line had already received appetizers by the time someone took our drink order. I had to get up and talk to the manager to get anyone's attention.

The place is also really small, and it definitely feels like they packed in at least one too many tables. I'd suggest that they need another waiter for that many tables, but there's really no room. It's also loud. Granted, the loud, packed feel contributes to the "hip" feel of the place, but don't expect to be able to have an intimate conversation here.

The food was fairly good. Oysters seemed fresh and well selected. Had an Impossible Burger (really glad they have this option, actually!) and shared a salad. For a half dozen oysters, one salad, two burgers, and no drinks: $90 after tax and tip. Not insane for SF, but definitely overpriced.< /Text>

I’ve been here for dinner and now brunch. Their drinks are always on point. There are so many different concoctions for all types of alcohol. When I’ve had dinner here, the food was decent but nothing spectacular. However, recently I came for brunch with some girlfriends and ordered the Shakshuka. It was yummy although I could’ve used more bread. I also wished someone warned me about how piping hot it was going to be because I burned the roof of my mouth with the first taste. Lastly, throughout the meal, there was annoying fruit flies or gnats that kept circling. It didn’t make for a pleasant meal in that respect.<//text>

Upscale, but cozy seating. Door staff is friendly and welcoming, bartenders are reserved and aloof while painstakingly hand crafting the cocktails. Good selection of wines and liquors. The cocktails are just okay in terms of appearance and taste.

Will probably try it again.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMKfCcEPxXu4R1xHeCXQkKUbCMUufkZVWIDnnN5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwOhqoDQAG4qg3lKkovXmN8bnR916Iwr_mPlxO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

The food, bar, and service at this new space in the Richmond were all excellent.  Loved the signature cocktail (pictured), and can't wait to come back for another awesome steak.  The polenta was great too!<//Text>

WOW, great place and Mary the bartender should be called Super Mary. She can manage a extremely busy place handling not only the bar but all those who ordered dinner at the bar. Management, Mary is a huge asset she was extremely polite while she was hustling. A definite keeper. The food was wonderful too!!< /text>

Food presentation was on point. Oysters were delicious and the Ceaser Salad was pretty good too but the service...

My friend and I sat placently after finishing our meals hoping to have the check presented to us in a timely manner. After 10 minutes of making eye contact with the 4 or 5 people behind the bar I spoke up to have it brought to us.

Not impressed with the service or the high end prices, but I've have no qualms with the quality of food they serve. Will be back at least once more to see if my experience gets better.</review>

They have outdoor seating that is really popular and usually requires reservations in advance. Food is good though bit expensive.</Text>

The fancy cocktails are indeed fancy but didn’t blow me away - most seemed just slightly off the mark (a little too sweet, a little too bitter, etc) but it might be exactly what you, reader, would like.

Went here for a quick bite around 8pm. Terrible service. The wait staff was more interested in talking with each other than helping us. Everyone was too busy being cool and hanging around the bar. I don't know who reviews these places. The wait staff was just too aloof.

Food was decent but way over priced for what you get.<//review>

Violets is a posh drinking environment that serves some food. I went for dinner and found the food options were very limited, priced high, and satisfying. I would not go back for the food however. I would go back for the drinks and the environment.  This was a place to start your evening with a group of friends to have posh drinks and maybe a little food.< /Text>

Good, but not great brunch. Short menu and although we ordered the server’s top 3 dishes we were pretty underwhelmed. And it’s overpriced. The beer selection is really good, so I might come back just to have a drink at the bar, but as a restaurant it doesn’t live up to the hype.</Text>

The menu is limited and overpriced. Service is slow...took almost 40 minutes to bring out a salad and an egg dish, and then the food was seriously not good.

<text>Food was your pretty normal "high end" taste - which, by all means is very good. However the additional shrimp with the Caesar Salad only came with 4 shrimp! At $9 for the shrimp that's like $2.25 per shrimp! That's oyster level pricing right there!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

A friend took me here when I was visiting SF, after I arrived late and this restaurant was new and within walking distance.

The first thing I noticed was the lack of variety on the menu. It seemed like everything was either tiny appetizer portions, or huge entrees.... nothing in between. We ordered our drinks.... the Pear thee Well and an Old Fashioned, and shared the grilled artichokes, and two salads.... my friend got the caesar salad with shrimp, and I ordered the seasonal winter salad that I forgot the name of. When I was deciding between items, I told the server that I wanted the salad instead of the Devils on Horseback (dates, bacon and blue cheese). He sent them out anyway, but oh well.

Both salads were okay but wayyyyy overdressed. I couldn't finish mine. Everything else was just okay. I've had better bacon-wrapped dates and this only came with 3. When I asked whether the Pear thee Well was sweet, our server (who wasn't the friendliest) told me flatly "it's balanced." It was overpoweringly sweet and tasted like it was mostly sour mix... I couldn't taste anything else.... no pear flavor or alcohol. I ended up sending it back for an old fashioned, which was the best item I had there.

When our server brought the check, we asked for one more round of drinks. Our server told us that the kitchen was closing, but we could go to the bar and order more drinks (which was a few feet away from us). It didn't seem to make sense, because he totally could have placed the order and had us check out separately with the bar, or just add another round of drinks to the check before he brought it (more tip for him, right?). They seemed to be using the same POS system. It wasn't the level of service you'd think you'd get for how much we paid for the food (after paying $8 for 3 dates, I'd at least hope for a "I'm sorry, I have to close the check with you, but let me just ask the bar to start working on those for you.") We didn't feel welcome and ended up going home for more drinks.<//Text>

<Review>I took my girlfriend out for her birthday to violets knowing it was an “upscale” place, but Was disappointed with quality of food. Everything is pricey so you expect good stuff but I didn’t get it. I didn’t think it was possible to get an oyster any smaller than the ones I got.

It’s frustrating when a restaurant thinks they can jack up their prices and feign class. I don’t mind spending money on a nice meal and Hugh class dinning experience, but that is not what violets is...< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808587df627c5275:0x397b6967339a5e21<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Definitely have kinks to work out. The service is slow, and the food can be inconsistent depending on the day. I don’t recommend this place for a celebration dinner as it’s cramped and loud, and the inattentive staff can put a damper on the mood.<//Review><time>1540391745214<//time>< Pics>

Food good. Bar service slow. Odd way of charging for cocktail 10.00 for vodka and than 2.00 for cranberry and lime ?? Why not say 12.00 cosmo<//text>

<text>High end bar and restuarant with good natural lighting. Sadly the experience was non existant. Bartenders seemed to not care the minute they found out we weren't interested in food. We had our beers and felt uncomfortable by the end of our visit. We closed out and they gave us the wrong check without even checking it. Bartender didnt seem apologetic after we mentioned his mistake. He gave us the new bill without saying a word.

I've worked bars before and in my opinion they didnt really care seeing as we weren't spending enough money. We won't be coming back.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Had the brunch charburger, which was decent. Fries are a little oversalted. Pretty much comparable with Burger King or Wendy's quality.</Text>

<text>Ordered a salad and chose the fried chicken option. The chicken was under cooked and looks pink and when you bite it feels extremely cold. I went in to complain about the chicken and they didnt do anything to compensate for me. So i had to toss the salad away. Waist of money and health.

Also every location i go to habit gives barely any fries every time i order. I feel like i get half a portion of fries instead of a full portion. I posted photos as proof. I love their sweet potato fries but am irritated by the fact that they give a very small amount every time i order and when i ask for them to fill the fries properly or top it off, the workers say that that is their standard portion they give to every one and dont even want to fill my fries like i ask.

They should increase the amount of fries they give in a portion and compensate customers for raw food< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMTFQI3dLFf1xn82bNtj6qCvc9YhZilRJObXsff=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnLd1OBxlWLfnZviO1KCofgEYkDKoZ6EcDJTxk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn2rBgTJfVBydEVOBBuoAZ1XA1AP9k-2dVja-9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCQOlNeFmZ3mRFQKehTyEKNxx5fzsJ3DV9COfl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>{'time': 1598889410238, 'text': 'Hi there, we are so sorry to hear about your recent experience at one of our restaurants.

I'm partial to The Habit's charbroiled flavored burgers. The fries are notable, too, but just wish they were more generous with them. 😜 I also really appreciate how seamless their online ordering system is during the pandemic-era. The Habit's easily one of the better burger chains around.</Text>

This location regularly closes early without warning or giving any reason. I ordered online, the order went through and I received a confirmation. By the time I got there, there was a sign on the door saying it was closed. After being ignored by one of the employees, a manager finally came out to talk to me. He very nonchalantly told me that there was a "problem in the kitchen" that made them close early, and my order hadn't actually been made at all. But I could go online to get a refund. Cool. Super helpful. Especially considering I had to submit customer feedback in order to hopefully get my money back. I asked if the kitchen issue happens often, knowing the location is regularly closed, and he just shrugged and said "yeah I don't know, it's just something that happens." Y'all's burgers aren't that good to justify the awful customer service. No plans to return here in the future.< /Review>

<text>This is a bad review related to the service, not the food. 11/6/20 around 5pm. Lady giving orders said rudely ( after I gave her the order number to get my pick up) "we don't do order number, only by the name. " Later, I saw the order number on the ticket. So obviously the order number is there. She made me feel like if it was my fault for not finding my pick up with my name. Very rude. Hopefully the owners work on giving staff a better customer service training because the burgers are great.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1604770475872, 'text': 'We are so sorry to hear about your recent experience at one of our restaurants.

It's your basic burger but it's still tasty! You have options for the bread and the things that you would normally have on your burger which makes me happy. I think that I've just gotten used to other places that I frequent,  that I think the habit burgers are a little on the smaller side. Hence the four stars.</Text>

The staff is awesome!
The burger was very tasty (although the bun was very cold)
The "garlic fries" were fantaaastic!!!
I will definitely go back and make sure that the bun is toasted well then.< /Text>

<text>Lots of good burger choices (beef, chicken, veggie) along with protein style. In addition they have solid sides, including tempura green beans. Also an assortment of condiments available to spice up your meal and good selection of original drinks to choose from.

Staff is very friendly and parking is generally easy to find at this location. It does get busy because it's a popular location.</text>< pictures>

<review>Very fast service, the restaurant was clean and full of happy customers! The food was Super Fresh and I'm comparing it to other habits that we have gone to.

Near my house and within walking distance.
Went there tonight to get a salad, ordered the Santa Barbara Cobb.
Mostly iceberg lettuce, and everything was finely diced, and very little of everything.There was barely any chicken, bacon, egg, tomato, or cheese, and some of the lettuce was brown.
It was disappointing and I didn't get my moneys worth.
I won't order that again!!< /text>

< review>
I scheduled an order through UberEats for a friend and the order was cancelled after around 30 minutes of being scheduled! I’d understand if it was cancelled on spot! But waking up to see the cancellation is very embarrassing. Despite the good reviews I’m very dissapointed with this!<//review>

A great Habit to have! Fresh burgers made to order! Another quintessential California Burger place, the thing that separates The Habit from the others is...VARIETY! Not only do they have burgers, they also have grilled chicken burgers/sandwiches, ahi tuna burgers,vegetarian burgers,salads,fries, sweet potato fries...and many more options! Their burgers are fresh and meaty, their chicken grilled perfectly, tuna cooked exactly as it should be,salads big and filling! If you haven't tried The Habit,give it a shot. Its a great deal for the QUALITY of food you get! There's a reason this place has exploded in popularity in the past few years...<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Habit ran a great promotion in March where they offered a free burger if you registered with their website.

I took them up on the offer since they have a location about a mile and a half from my house.

In all honesty, I was pretty blown away by the quality of the food. They make a delicious burger and I've since been back to try their strawberry & grilled chicken salad which was also excellent. I hope they'll consider making it a permanent addition to their menu.

These days, there are a lot of places you can go to get a burger, but I'll vouch for Habit being one of the better options.</Review>< Pics>

The whole flame grilled meat idea is interesting and this like a Burger King on steroids. The burgers are really good and very reasonably priced. The shakes and sides are also tasty. I was skeptical at first but the food was very good and cheaper than I expected. When I visit California I would definitely go back.< /review>

<text>I give this spot all 5 stars because they never fail to execute. I'm not saying the Habit is the tastiest burger in SoCal, simply that this Habit location is on point. Always clean, friendly, and until now has never messed up my order. The food is what you expect it to be so that's that.< /text>< Date>

Today I was given a burger that was obviously sitting for quite some time before being given to me. My
Bread was hard. So hard I think it was stale. Entire experience ruined for sure. Not sure if this location can handle to go orders of this magnitude.<//review>

<review>They were all very nice however not paying attention..basically they screwed up my order 3x. As she was reading off my receipt reviewing it before sending me off to go. I had to ask about my chocolate shake(i asked for it originally to drink while I wait for the food), then I left and had to come back to get the Apple juice they forgot. Then came home to expired(07/4) apple slices in my kids meal.... a day maybe, but 4 days.. what other dates did they not check?< /review>< pics>

<review>You are welcomed by a friendly and helpful staff. Modifications to the meals can be made without fuss. Orders are repeated back to the customers to insure that the meal is made correctly. Seasonal items are advertised in restaurant on placards. This restaurant has just been remodeled to improve efficiency and ambience. The meals are served fast, but this is not a typical high-volume fast food franchise. Preparation, presentation and palatable fare are of consistently high quality. The Habit is my favorite fast food chain.< /review>< pics>

There was prompt and great customer service as soon as you walk in. They greeted and welcomed each guest.  My burger was exactly what I wanted and ordered. I love that they repeat your order before you pay and again when you pick it up, they verify it's what you ordered. I enjoyed every bite with the fresh just cooked fries.< /review>

My husband and I love this place!  The burgers are always yummy and I like the variety of food they offer. The chicken club sandwich does not disappoint and their onion rings are delicious.  I believe they have succeeded in winning us over from In-N-Out (although I still like their burgers too). Only one downer is that they only offer vanilla cones--no chocolate whenever I've been there 🤨  But the employees are all friendly and quick to assist.<//review>

<Text>Very fresh burgers made to order. The tempura green beans were a nice change from fries. Staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and quite friendly. Parking can be a real issue. The lot is just not large enough. The restaurant seems to have enough seating.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Love, love, love! By far one of my favorite places to grab a burger made to order with fresh ingredients and served with a smile.  The staff is always friendly and on top of things.  You don't just feel like a customer, you feel like family.  Highly recommend. You won't be in and out as you might stay awhile.</review>

The food is pretty good. Unfortunately the last two times I've ordered from there, one pickup order and one in person to-go order, both were missing items. I should have double checked after the first time. Lesson learned I suppose.<//review>

A popular place with reliable food that is somewhat bland but fresh prepared.The counter guy was friendly and helpful and the place was clean. The fried green beans were hot and crispy but really couldn't taste the char of the burger even though I ordered it without the mayo and ketchup specifically to see how the meat tasted.<//review>

Pretty good burgers for a decent price. Always busy at the Habit Grill but the line moves fast. It's more expensive than McDonalds but if you're focus is more on saving money instead of great tasting burgers, stop torturing yourself and stop reading this review!< /review>

I just love Habit!! They girl their burgers right in front of you, you can customize how you want and you can get 1/2 fries and 1/2 onion rings with your order. Don't forget about the ranch dressing for the rings either!! I'd take a 1/2 star away for the remodel and removing the bench for to go orders but other then that I love the place. Check the prices, for what you'd py at the Golden archs compared to here it's on the same level for food that's 10x better<//review>

<review>I love the Habit Burger girl because the food is so fresh and delicious I ordered the barbecue chicken salad which is one of my favorite BBQ salads ever the line was very long and I sat outside and the umbrellas for shade were all broken. Also the legs on the tables were all uneven. I guess the fries made up for it.< /review><gmapID>0x80c2be1f85fec4dd:0xfba1f42cad36a9b8</gmapID></record>

Great burgers and fries. Parking is plentiful if you don't need to park near the entrance. The restaurant is clean and service is great but the patio can use a good scrubbing down.</Review>

They got right on it and gave me a drink and fries on top of the countless apologies. All I expected was my burger, definitely above standard service. Good people, good food.

<Review>Friendly fast service. Food is consistently delicious. I always get the Santa Barbara. The milkshakes are good and they have a couple agua frescas and brewed teas too! It's in a plaza with a parking lot so you don't have to park on the street like many food joints around there, so you can get to your food stat!< /Review>< Pictures>

I eat here almost daily. Their burgers are amazing! And the wait is never long to get your food. Even if there's a line you're waiting 5-10 minutes at most. The phone - in service is also very nice to be able to call ahead.</Review>

< Review>
I'm a fan of the Habit. I love their salads, and typically order their Cobb salad. Their chicken nuggets and onion rings are on point as well. Today I deviated and ordered the #2 The Original Char. All good all fresh, but flavorless. I had to add ketchup to it to remind me I was ordering something akin to a burger, but was still completely disappointed. I'm going to keep ordering salads and on the off time I want a burger, I'll go to In-n-out just a couple of blocks away.</Review>

<text>Quick and friendly service, decent prices.  Bacon burger and citrus chicken salad were excellent (standadd-priced burger was a little on the small side for the price).  Salad was good, portion sizes are meh... average.  Good quality food.< /text>< rating>

<review>Everyone must try this burger joint sometime in there life. They got some pretty good burgers here and especially there malt shakes those are the best! I never had a malt shake in my life till now and it is the best here. The issue of this place is it gets to crowded at times and you may have a few troubles finding a place to sit and eat.</review>< gmap_id>

<text>High-quality shakes and burgers. There's barely enough indoor seating for the amount of traffic it gets, but you can usually find some place to sit and eat. Same story with the parking lot; most of time there's at least one or two spots open, but it's generally pretty full.<//text>< rating>

Delicious burgers! The tables weren't cleaned after patrons left, so we had to clear it off ourselves... But the burgers and onion rings were so good!<//Text>

<Text>Love Habit chain one of the best tasty burgers  in California. Beats all other chains but this particular location sux big time. It gets super busy here and of course the service/product suffers from it. When ordering to go they always forget sides dishes like frys or other stuff is missing. So next time everyone including myself should check everything is there you ordered. It happened more than two or three times so no there's No Honest Mistake this time!<//Text>< user>

<Text>A great Lunch Spot for a family on Vacation. I would definitely recommend Habit Burger. Their Comfort Style of cook is wel done. More seating would be great, the location I tried in LA was packed, it's understandable being how great the food is. Habit Burger is a MUST TRY!!!!!< /Text>< rating>

Mmmmmmmm burgers. Like it that you can change up the type of bread on your burger and also splitting the fries with onion rings.  Love the freshness of the beef patties.< /Text>

< review>
If you want fast food but don't necessarily want to go to the depths of something like a Jack In The Box or McDonald's The Habit is a great option.  They have a wide variety of different Burgers including salads and chicken options. They even have  an Ahi salad that's not just a terrifying generic ocean meat.

It's a small kids menu but they have high chairs and booster seats available.  Mainely indoor seating but there is a small outdoor patio.< /review>

Really great burger, for the money. This is easily my favorite place to get a good cheap burger, and they have sweet potato fries. These guys have totally stolen me away from In-N-Out when I want to grab a cheap burger.< /text>

<review>I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THE SERVICE. ... I WOULD GIVE THEM
10 STARS IF I COULD!!
☆☆☆☆☆ ☆☆☆☆☆
From the moment we walked in, we got a big welcome and they immediately took our order...the food came out fast and it was on point!!! Hot, fresh and absolutely delicious! ! Then the staff was amazing,  they came to our table asked if everything was ok(since when???) They made me feel so happy - with my choice of having  dinner there.
BEST SERVICE I HAVE RECEIVED IN A LONG TIME ◇AND I EAT OUT A LOT◇
FROM FANCY TO FAST FOOD DRIVE THRU.
☆☆IF YOU WANT TO EAT SOME GOOD FOOD AND GET SUM FANTASTIC SRRVICE??? I HOPE TO SEE YOU AT THIS HABIT!! THEY HAVE EARNED MY UPMOST RESPECT AND A LOYAL CUSTOMER! !

<rate>4<//rate><text>We're pescetarian, so our options are somewhat limited here, but I keep coming back for the delicious tempura green beans.  The albacore tuna sandwich is great too - fresh sushi-grade lightly seared tuna.  I'm not a huge fan of how they serve the veggie burger (on a wheat bun with tomato, cucumber, onion, and honey dijon), so I order it charburger style so that it comes just like their classic burger, just with a veggie patty instead of beef.<//text>< Pics>

My first impression of the Habit was unforgettable. I ordered the tri tip sandwich and was astonished at The fact that I've been missing out on such a delicious and rewarding experience. The service was excellent. The staff were very friendly and I will be anticipating my next visit. My only dilemma is whether to pick the tri tip again or try something new. Lol.< /text>

<Review>Ok burger place. Quality seems to be on the down swing, food is inconsistent. If don't like lots of salt in your food, dont go there. Staff is friendly but just cant seem to make adjustmemts to your order, you get what you get. But the price is lower than any place around.<//Review>< pics>

What can I say... I come here regularly because it is a great deal, for some great food, the service is always great... and if they make a mistake they will make good on it. Only problem is they are always BUSY, so hopefully you can find a seat if your eating in.</Review>

Was visiting a friend in NOHO. She had a burger craving. We came to eat at The Habit. Honestly I think the burgers here are way better than In n Out burgers. A lot more flavor and juice to the meat. I feel like their vegies are a lot more fresh too. Bottom line 5 stars delicious junk food cravings. lol<//Text>

< Review>
It's a Hamburger Habit (INO) since it's not very good. I'm not saying it's awful (it is just burgers) just not up to usual high standards of a Hamburger Habit.  But as far as fast cheap food on campus you can't beat the price but ehh.  They always get my order wrong even when I use TapinGo app AND write my request.  I've never understood how people mess up fried beef but their are tons of places that do!

I wish I could give it a meh but OK is the closest.</Review>
