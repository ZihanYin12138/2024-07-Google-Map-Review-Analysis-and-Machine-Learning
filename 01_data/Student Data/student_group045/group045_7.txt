< Review>
Went here for an after party on a Friday night. It was fun. Danced in the back. I was already drunk on arrival so can't tell if the music was good. I think it was 90s r&b. I left my jacket here and had to come back to get it on a random Sunday night. That Sunday night they had a comedy stand up night.. I thought that was cool, but couldn't stay. I think I'd come back here.< /Review>

Honestly for the price you are better off clubbing at a chick-fil-a 😂 the cover was $50 even for girls and the music was mostly horrible hip-hop. The vibe is more deceased than my ancestors and security were pushy. You would only find this club fun if your parents sponsor your booth 😂 drinks were pretty much $15 dollars a shot and honestly we should've just went to a strip club. EDIT: Deju Vu Afterhours was actually more fun and I should've spent my cover on lap dances</Review>

We decided to host a birthday party for my wife at 1 OAK. Since we chose an Oscar Award Ceremony theme, our black tie event required a complex preparation and we got full support and cooperation from Sarah. We have heard so many complements on the place, its ambiance and the staff that I would highly recommend anyone to consider 1 OAK for your next event. That night will definitely be the one to remember. Thank you!< /text>

<Review>When going to 1OAK LA be sure to dress very well because the bouncers are finicky and will allow or deny your entry based on how you look and come across. One inside gorgeous big room nightclub that keeps the hip hop spinning. Drinks are automatically upsized. Not bad..< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUNGgpoVX8Smq0KYEezQe-DzRQ0OnSovmOFrOz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNNt0Qi_NkydjE1XC_zwMIpZHEKFq3vC1K0k8UV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRW8iOSyZbHNjGaTmya0PVgIgGdspJgUUuEbSP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlFfLUq3xleI4RVzoL9Zvgy0x2M2eJ4_l8W0U9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bea1a3f52a5b:0xb8daae484d662a03< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Horrible. On date 11-9-19 i went and all the employees were useless and rude. I say useless because i asked 2 employees how much was cover and they said they didn't know. How do yoi work here but not know how much is cover.  Finally i spoke to a girl with dark hair and a Russian accent and she said $50 per entrance. That's absolutely crazy. Definitely a pass<//Review>

<Review>It is pretty racist to be honest, not to mention the crazy amount of underage girls who get in looking for drama. In a busy night there’s just so much to deal with. Very immature crowd. Super skinny people only lol that’s why they mostly are 13 years old, don’t get me wrong you could be in for a very fun place in some nights. But I’m not blind to the difference of treatment towards black or brown beautiful girls.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<review>Personally, this was a TERRIBLE dance club experience for me.  If you are truly a lover of house music and want to get your groove going on a quality dance floor, this is NOT the place to go.  No room at all to dance or move for that matter.  I'd guess that 95% of the square footage on the lower level is dedicated to VIP/bottle service tables, bar space or crowded walkways.  The dance floor is the smallest I've ever seen in a house club (attended their Friday night "Deep Space" event) and it was completely blocked in by VIP suites.  If your thing is going out to "SEE and BE SEEN", then this is probably the place for you.  Movement is impossible, but if your ass likes an overpriced VIP booth seat, then you'll love this place.  Went specifically to see Dennis Cruz and it was a TOTAL BUST!  Didn't get to dance to one track (unless you consider dancing being crammed into a corner to avoid heavy walkway traffic).  The best part of the night - drove over an hour to get to this sad excuse for a club and they falsely advertised the opening time.  Arrived at 10pm, which is what the tickets indicated and the arrogant security guard told us that doors wouldn't open until 11.  The venue closed at 2am, so essentially, you'll pay top dollar to get into this place for three shitty hours of nonsense.  I could've saved a ton of money and just gone to a crappy club in Orange County had I known - No Difference at all!  I feel robbed :(<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

100% true they let people in based on race. I will not stand by while others are discriminated against. They ONLY let white woman in without charge but then denied woman of Color (black/Mexican) for the reasoning that they were at capacity and if they want in they would have to pay 100 dollars each and in another situation let 2 of the 3 men in the 2 being light skin and the 3rd being dark skinned. When the dark skinned man would get to the front she would close the line and ask the man for 1000 dollars to get in! It’s time we stop supporting these businesses! They want to make money off of a black artist but don’t want to let anyone of Color into the club!< /text>

2) The crowd inside literally acts like high school kids
3) Music was bad and the dance floor was small
4) They charged $50 to get in (anorexic girl at the door insisted that only cash was accepted at the door. She keeps part of the money?). However, this place was so wacked that I left after 10 minutes

If you have ever experienced the clubbing scene in Miami, San Diego or SF you will be VERY disappointed with LA. I can't believe this is how people party here in LA. It is just SAD</Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<Text>The club system is weird in LA. It's set up to be semi exclusive. I used to have problems getting into this place. You have to show up early, know a bouncer, bring a group of attractive people or be willing to pay whatever made up cover charge the bouncer comes up with in the moment. I will say that once you're in...its like a movie< /Text>< Pics>

(Gave this spot a 1 star because negative 8 million wasn't an option) Last night at 1OAK LA, I was at a friends table when I saw a girl I was with ask this man to stop stepping on her.. he immediately engaged in aggressive behavior. He started yelling and then he swung on this girl and LUCKILY she was a master at the bob and weave or else she would have been seriously injured. The girl ended up going over to the HEAD OF SECURITY to ask for help and their response was "He can do whatever he wants". I'm sorry but I will never go back and I will tell every female friend of mine not to feel safe when they go there. Good job 1OAK, glad we're all in 2018 still treating women like second class citizens.<//review>

Being overcharged $500 on purpose by the club's host on your bottle tab is the last thing one would expect while celebrating their 30th birthday with friends. A last minute idea to party at 1Oak to bring in my bday turned out to be a mistake I'll never forget. Prior to purchasing bottle service, I spoke with the club's host, Kevin Houck, outside and was quoted $600 after gratuity and taxes. Afterwards, I got a bill for $100 extra than the amount previously quoted. To make matters worse, Kevin promised me that the 2 remaining members in my party would be granted admittance upon their arrival several minutes later. We had small talk and found out him and I were both from Maryland as he stated, "Oh just write down their names here and let them show me their Maryland ID's when they get here and I'll know they're with you. This was not the case. I spent half an hour going back and forth to the front door trying to get them in rather than enjoying my 30th. When questioned about them getting in, he simply lied and said he never said that.
Finally, when I got my tan and asked why the amount on the receipt was $100 extra than the $600 quote at the door (after taxes and gratuity), he once again lied and stated that he never gave a quote. I then requested to speak to his manager. He became very hostile, raising his voice and became argumentative. Of course he denied everything upon his manager's arrival. I paid and left to go home that Saturday night.
I woke up Monday morning for work, checked my online bank account and found I had been charged for an additional $500, increasing my charge to $1,200 rather than $700. I called 1Oak and they stated they do not issue refunds and that I should take it up with my bank.
I say Kevin overcharged me on purpose because they sent in a copy of a form every bottle service customer signs upon entrance, indicating that the individual understands that table service will be at a minimum of $500, no less. They sent this form to my bank upon dispute in an attempt to falsely accuse me of agreeing to pay an additional $500 on top of the bottle cost, tax and gratuity fees. I've attached photos of bank statement and receipt copies below. AWFUL AWFUL EXPERIENCE.
Thankfully, my bank read through the nonsense and the lies and I was refunded the $500, but not without a valuable lesson learned. I've been to the Vegas 1 Oak prior to moving to California and had no issues but at this time I will NEVER EVER EVER step foot in another 1Oak, nor will my friends or family. They will not get a single dollar from us or anyone we know. I advise anyone with any sense to stay away from this establishment as they are crooks and on top of that, hassle minorities upon entrance IF they even let you in. Lesson learned, taking our money elsewhere! Sidenote, there's this thing in life called Karma.</Text>

Love this nightclub!! Such a great time every time I step into the building. My wife & I always go with all of our friends and I would highly recommend the table service there. No one really wants to stand the whole night in a mosh pit you know? It's worth every single dollar and I promise you that. Great DJ's spinning all the time. Love the vibe out there.< /review>

<review>So 1 Oak is the epitome of the club experience in LA with one MAJOR downfall: dope music, hot people, and exclusive--definitely go with a promotor or table ready. That being said, this 1 star review is because of one particular staff member.

Often, there is a white man in a black hoodie holding a clipboard who is extremely disrespectful to those waiting in line. On multiple nights, I have witnessed him demand $200 to a group of 3 girls waiting and then just $40 to another group of 3 girls behind them with completely arbitrary reasoning. And by arbitrary reasoning, I mean it seems pretty racially discriminating towards certain people and made worse by his rude demeanor...Something is very wrong there. And even as someone who has been coming to this club for over a year, I've been charged an expensive cover fee which is understandable but just emphasizes that loyalty isn't valued at this club at all.

Honestly, I used to love 1 Oak and went pretty often but something needs to change drastically in their bouncer guy. I've met much nicer staff, bouncers, etc. at Hyde down the street tbh...go there instead.< /review>< pictures>

I haven’t been to 1oak in years; the last time I went was in Vegas. I didn’t have to pay in Vegas because the promoter got me and my friends in for free, so I wasn’t sure how much the entry was. Last night my boyfriend and I wanted to check out the 1oak in Hollywood and when we got to the front of the line, the skinny white lady with black hair greeted us and told us it’s $50 a person and my boyfriend didn’t hear correctly so he said $15? And the lady said No $50. He then asked if she could get me in for free since I’m a lady and he will pay the $50, and her reply was: “I do not like your attitude right now so I’m going to say no, but I was considering it”. First of all, my boyfriend didn’t have an attitude. He simply asked in a kind manner. From the get go this lady wasn’t friendly. I said hi when I walked up and she had this weird smirk on her face. She was very rude and unhappy with her life it seems like. We ended up going to the RED ROOM and paying $5 an entry per person. The money wasn’t an issue. If she wasn’t so rude, my boyfriend would’ve paid for us to get in and also get a bottle because it was our anniversary! Do not come here! They are rude and racist! My boyfriend is black and just reading other reviews, I understand why she was so rude!<//text>

Such a beautiful venue in Los Angeles, literally reminds me of Vegas! Shoutout to Echelon Society - Party & Event Planning for planning/booking my VIP experience and more importantly 1 OAK for amazing hospitality and an EPIC NIGHT!< /review>

1Oak is probably the best high end hip hop club around. The Owner, Richie Akiva, is a great guy. This place really frequents celebrities and has bottles constantly popping. The only downside to this place is the stupid exclusivity they use, but in the same breath that's what makes it. They discriminate against girls who don't fit the model look, and they make guys pay $200 to get in the door. That doesn't include the $20 bar pour drinks. The decorum could really use an update. There are 1oaks all over the place. This is the biggest one with the most space (although i have never been to the one in Dubai.) If you've got a really attractive group of friends, give this place a go. You'll have a good time.</Text>

People in the reviews who are giving negative feedback are just angry because they don’t have the connections/status/wealth to get in. Also fees may fluctuate depending on who you are. Most of the time I get guestlisted for free and don’t have to pay any fees. If you’re getting charged $200, be lucky that they’re even offering that to let you in. This club is exclusive for a reason. People who have higher status or wealth want to be surrounded by people of their own kind, not common folk who will cause a scene. If you’re in LA I definitely reccomend 1Oak. I’ve had some of my best nights here.< /text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

We noticed that only coloured girls (black and brown) were in line and all white girls were being let in straight away. A few members of our party ( including me) decided to leave because it was obvious there was something fishy going on. We went and sat several metres away from the line up and one of the staff members (Persian guy) came up to us and said we were not able to get in as a few girls in our group were "not hot." These were his exact words. He also added the girls that were not hot would need to pay and the hot ones wouldnt. We found this appalling and made sure to make the other staff members aware of this. Not sure id they will actually confront this staff member.</Text>< pictures>

If Robbie is the bouncer you wont get it. They overcharge and discriminate as you can see up and down the comments. I've been here but only on a Tuesday/ Thursday so i can only imagine what you can experience on Friday / Saturday. Stay away!!! This place is not worth it.</review>

RELAXXXX buddy, It's NOT that serious. People come out to have a good time and spend money. If they don't show you DON'T have a JOB. 1Oak NYC > LA</Review>< Pics>

Most racist club I have ever been at. Me and my group of bachelorette girls were there 10 minutes prior opening. First in line. All of us looking good! A group of 16 girls. We were asked how we can get in and the bouncer looked us up and down and said 30$ each to pay with “Mexican dollars”. The money was not the issue. Issue was white women were getting in for free. I tried to talk to one of their promoters he too looked me up and down and said I can only get you in not the rest of your party. He also said I have to get these other two girls in ( white women) he pulled out his wallet, took out IDs and gave them and ID. And guided them to the front to let them in. I was so disgusted I left the venue! Bad horrible service!!!<//review>

The epitome of everything you imagine that sucks about LA. Self obsessed boooooooring people shuffling around a dance floor pretending they know how to dance. Mediocre club music piped through a really bad (but I'm sure expensive) sound system. Cover was $80, which I assume is because everyone inside is on G and not ordering drinks because they can't afford the calories. Total trash.</Text>

This was the best club i have been to in my life. It was me and 200 hundred models. I didnt even have hair at the time and i was overweight. But once that liquid courage hit me i was like a chubby smooth operator. I went around the club drunk just staring at all the beautiful women i got played 3 times and rejected another 3. It was like i died and woke up in heaven. Imagine you died and when you woke uo you were in a club packed with gorgeous women. I look left right up side everywhere there were woman. Beautiful beautiful white woman that i highly desire. One woman was absolutely stunning and tall. Later i saw her doing a quite peculiar wild dance that was funny later when i imagined it. Overall i must say once my hair grows a bit and i lose 40 pounds and i look like brad pitt again i will go back and torture everyone. 5 star you must come here.<//text>

Have had work functions here and not a huge fan. Its a really cool spot, but very much a typical hollywood club and super busy. Also, last time I was here it was very problematic for people trying to smoke (not me) because they didnt have an area they could sneak out to. They had to leave and re enter.<//Review>

If it was possible to give no stars I would have done so.  I have never  written a review  for any club or lounge but I decided this could help  a visitor  from out of town.

I was visiting  LA for the first  time,  saw the  good reviews online  and decided to try the place out.  I get there with my friends  and they wouldn't  let us in.  I spoke to one of the bouncers  and I was told I wouldn't  be able to get in because I didn't  know any of the promoters.  I told the bouncer we were visiting  from out of state therefore it was impossible to know any of promoters.  I tried  talking  to a few other  people at the door  and they  wouldn't  give me a chance  to explain  that I was a visitor  so they should  make an exception.

This is a bad idea if you are not from  LA,  don't  try it you wouldn't  get in unless you are at the door before they open and that isn't  guaranteed.</Text>

Honestly you are better off just going to Vegas for the night than coming here. I used to do it when I was younger. Get to work at 5am, out at 1:30pm, be in Vegas by 6:30pm, party till 1 and hit the road back to work at 5am.

You have to open your eyes and remember this his LA, Hollywood, the fakest town in America, where even money can’t buy some things. I’ve been on both sides of the fence with them, both with no juice and my own fault I couldn’t get in as well as treated like a VIP watching others get snubbed.

I was 20 years old and didn’t get into some club in Vegas because of my shoes and since then I’ve always been overdressed. I still see guys in jeans on Thursdays and guys in double pleated slacks on Saturdays get in for a variety of reasons. The women here are young and hot and that’s what usually attracts guys, but they turn away so many people it’s disheartening to others trying to get in. Anything could trigger them to not let you in and it’s not always looks. On the surface it seems racist, but in knowing people in that industry it’s not.

It’s a large, open, expansive space where they really push the bottles. Even with a promotional hook up they are up charging significantly, so there very little value in a booth/bottle. Drinks are expensive and it’s not that they are watered down it’s that they use bad ice, which would melt in 5 minutes anyhow. You are better off with a beer, shots are expensive too. Bathrooms are nice and it’s not so dark you can’t walk around or see where you are going. There is always this faint smell of a place that needs to be disinfected. Like it’s some massive axe body spray coverup.

Hip Hop is heavy on Thursdays, but more EDM on Saturdays, moving towards some trap, but the bangers they drop are some industry middle of the road stuff, nothing grimey. If you want real music and chill vibes check out Red Cup Sundays. No one comes here for the music though. It’s to see or be seen, or just say you went.

Here is where the stars come off. My booth was given away to some B squad celebrity, 2 friends of mine could not get in because the booth size was overstated on another occasion nearly doubling the quote from our promoter. A separate occasion the doorman tried asking me for $50 or he’ll make sure I don’t get in. They tried charging a bottle of our neighboring booth to us because they thought we knew each other, but were just friendly. They posted a security guard at the door for like 10 minutes one night not allowing anyone into the bathroom because someone celebrity was doing drugs and having sex and didn’t want any witness’. People regularly smoke inside and I’m a smoker, but was told I had to go outside without re-entry. It’s these types of things that make the people who actually get in, not have fun, which just brings the whole place down. There is not enough drinks in the world that will get me back in this place.</review>

<user_name>malay bender<//user_name><review>I don't understand how your establishment play all black music, but are racist to black people. They'll only let you in if you're white, or mixed, but look mostly white. They don't like black or Hispanics ...UNLESS you're  famous,  then you're good enough, because they're using you for exposure.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bea1a3f52a5b:0xb8daae484d662a03< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's a disgrace that this once great property, with it's great history of rock n roll, descended to this.

Für deutsche Verhältnisse sehr unorganisierter Einlass. Aber mit genug Geld (50$ pro Mann), Geduld und nicht zu vielen Typen ein echt geiler Club mit 80% Frauen<//text>

<Text>Buyer be ware !!!! Stay away from this place since the charge you for items not purchased!!!. I’ve been going to this nursery for over 40 years. Yesterday I had a clerk who without counting the items charged me over$100.00 which seemed odd to me. When I mentioned that the tomato plants were on sale she was highly annoyed. She ran the bill again without looking at the plants and this time charged me $93.00 which was still too high. I asked for the itemized bill and she said they don’t have one and run everything by hand. Then she left. I looked at the bill and figured out that she had  charged me for 3 extra items that I had not purchased. I asked another younger clerk to correct the bill and she was too scared and intimidated to do it but finally at my insistence corrected the bill. I asked for the manager NICK and explained the situation but instead of apologizing and saying that he’ll make sure that his workers pay attention, he was rude, arrogant and said that I don’t have to buy from there which I will not. I know times are hard for businesses but it does not justify stealing and being rude and arrogant about it.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<text>Decent selection. The best part is they have a cute little store kitty that roams the premises. I gave them three stars because we bought a plant and a pot, and they charged us $4 to put the plant into the pot because they had to add a handful of soil to it (we didn't want to buy a whole bag but like...come on, you couldn't just give us a scoop of soil for buying all that??).< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMksYoL1RTqKCrGo_V6K-p9bufj2jqe5t3niP4k=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYkFffaTr_ugkZPG1qxpDF9U6nHepTpATwfeJX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNEVxwePjCAXi7Wniwk4dcdcXxtMXqn0NpFnQ1t=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<text>Narrow selection of indoor plants and minds. Capacity for the indoor gift and plant shop is 8 people at a time. We waited for permission to enter, despite there being no one else in line and only two people inside, as we were a group of 4. We were let in but immediately, one of the female cashiers loudly and condescendingly called out "We're at capacity with THEM." We begin looking over the selection of plants and one of our group mentioned in Spanish they have peace lilies and explaining to another of the group the growing requirements, when an employee interjects quickly to ask "Peace lilies? You're looking for peace lilies?" After laughing it off and saying no, the first cashier loudly sighed and told the second employee "I'm just expressing how I feel internally, externally." Finally at the check-out, I HANDED the original rude cashier my card, to her HAND. She returned it by quickly slapping it down on the counter. I was surprised and I think it showed on my face, even with my mask on. She must have seen my reaction and then handed me my receipt. As another person from our group was paying and thanking the cashier, another employee behind the cashier turned to look with an upset expression at our friend. Bad customer service,
and it's difficult to tell who the employees are unless they're behind the counter.</text>< pictures>

It'a a great nursery. Staff are very helpful and knowledgable. They have a cute gift shop in which they sale local crafts, pottery, honey and indoor plants. They ssle most of fruit trees. Varieties of apple, peach, cherry, plum, jujube, asian pear, apricot trees.
They also have various flower trees like lilacs, roses and mamy more.
They have variety of sun plants however their sun plants are a little overpriced comparing to other nurseries and gardening centers of chain suppliers.
They have a pottery corner as well which is very reasonable and fairly priced. They also have outdoor water features and variety of mulch, tool, formulas and gardening tools. I highly recommend it to plant and gardening enthusiasts.< /Text>

Warning: This is the best nursery with the most knowledgeable and friendly staff! I love all the staff members here  since they all go above and beyond to provide the best customer service! Thank you! I wish I had asked for their names to acknowledge them all by name here for all their help.

This place has a very large selection of high quality, popular roses and many other variety of flowers to trees. I was very surprised to find all the roses I couldn’t find at other local nurseries as well as rare flowers such ice plants. It’s too bad that I had already purchased my ice plants online last week, after trying several nurseries before discovering Almaden Valley Nursery today.  Although this place isn’t as inexpensive as Home Depot’s Gardening section, you’ll be impressed by the quality and variety of flowers and trees. I’ve never found the popular roses I’ve wanted at Home Depot. I was very happy to see some of the popular roses that I could not find at other local nurseries or online such as Barbara Streisand Lavender Rose (Weeks Rose), Love Rose (which is a bright red rose with white reverse by Weeks Rose), and Mr. Lincoln, which is also by Weeks. They were all very healthy and tall roses with fragrance and a bunch of buds. The most fragrant is the Mr. Lincoln Red Rose. I have purchased Mr. Lincoln in the past but the other three roses are new roses that I’ve wanted.  I had a hard time deciding but I had limited space in my car so I purchased four roses and a violet color Geranium Rozanne as pictured below. The forth rose I bought today from Almaden Valley Nursery was clearly mislabeled by the supplier since it was labeled as one of the stripped color roses; yet, it’s a very fragrant rose bush with very large hot pink double blooms; I think it’s an English Rose. The roses were $49.99 but they said the price was $47 each because I was bought more than 3 roses. I’m in love with this nursery and will be back soon! Thank you. 💜💙💜<//Review>

They have a wide variety of outdoor plants and pots. In comparison, not a lot of indoor plants though. The staff seemed very friendly and helpful.</Text>

Almaden Valley Nursery has flower cookies and plants you might not find at other nurseries. They have excellent and knowledgeable staff. There is a quality gift shop in the front.< /Review>

Nick, the store manager is completley rude, lacks grace, is disrespectful with not a trace of customer service. When asked to speak with the owner Matt Lepow he ignored the request. I found the staff to be young with little knowledge of gardening and landscaping needs and care.

I drove 105 miles round trip to find out that every branch on the Kafir Lime tree has insects. Nick's response was it was common simiular to a rose having aphids. That is some damage from citrus leaf miner. It was sprayed but may need additional spraying. This if from a moth that lays its eggs on the leaf and then the larva tunnels in it making it curl.  This insect is very wide spread and the plants are even shipped to us from our supplier with damage from this insect especially when it is high pressure which is in spring and the end of summer.  I explaines had I known I would have not purchaed.

Now I have to drive another 105 miles to return the infested tree. He said that was my decision not his.  His response was since I was angry that I had to travel he would save me the trip if I cut the tree at the base, send him a photo to confim the act and than he would refund me over the phone.

What a waste to an expensive tree that is in high demand. They should have treated it before sputting it on sale.

I suggest HOME DEPO to AVN or better EAST BAY nurseries  - Always  with awesome and super passionate staff.< /text>

Also staffs are not as friendly as other local nurseries. When I finally picked the flower from a unnoticeable  corner, but it is little bit over closing time. I told the staff that I drove a long way to get here, however they just refuse to check out it for me. It’s a bad shopping experience.< /review>< Pics>

I understand reopening after COVID 19 has been tough on so many businesses...AVN is no exception.  I've always so enjoyed shopping here for healthy plants and a great variety. The plant selection wasn't the usual abundant stock and  what was available seemed a little withered.  That being said I will continue to shop here.  They have great service and I'm sure will rebuild the vitality of the plants to their usual vibrance in no time!  I will continue to support the comeback of our local businesses.</text>

<resp>None</resp><text>I had the worse experience in nursery ever at your place. It would be nice if you kindly update your FB page that you do not let anyone go in after 3:30pm.

I arrived at 3:35pm, I was told I cannot go in, which is fine, I politely explained to your staff that I couldn’t come from 10-3:30pm but I need to buy 2 tree roses, asked if there is any other way he can help since I was there already, he said come on another day. I explained couple times that I couldn’t due to kids learning restrictions, I asked if you guys carry tree roses, he said yes, come check it out another day. I asked him which types, I wish to get combination color types and he said yes, you guys carries it but he doesn’t know which type. I asked if he could get me a list, he said come another day to find out. I asked couple times if I could find information somewhere else, and he said FB. I check immediately but couldn’t find it and he said he can’t help, he don’t know where to find it. I asked if he can’t ask someone that knows the answer, he said he can’t. Since I just keep asking him questions, finally he asked someone, then he came back and said check FB, there is a list. I checked and found that it has a Bush rose list, I asked him if tree rose is different? That is a list for Bush rose, and he said he can’t help. Under pandemic situation, with all the changes, I understand it is not easy for everyone, he said he have to make sure people come out on time and so he cannot ask anyone to help me. That’s helpful, I asked him if he have told the person he asked that I am looking for tree rose and that list for Bush rose may or may not apply to what I need, and he said I yelled at him. I will definitely post my comments online to share with everyone. Hope this experience could help you guys in some ways.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Once we moved to the area we started looking for a local nursery first. And we couldn't have been more happy with Almaden Valley. They have a phenomenal collection of everything you can think of. Also their gift shop has everything else you need outside the garden. Very helpful nice people. And cute little kitties that roam around and accompany you when you're picking your plants. Love this place<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Good nursery with a decent variety of plants to choose from. The staff is friendly, when you can find someone to help you. Plants come with warranty: I purchased a plant here and six months later, it was looking very sad. I brought the plant back (or what was left of it) and they gave me a new one. Tends to be more expensive than the big box stores, but the plants are healthier and better looking too.</Review>< pics>

They always seem to have plants I've never seen before.  Also, the garden accessories/gifts are well priced and high quality.  For me it's worth paying a little extra to have such a great resource close to home!  Helpful, knowledgeable staff of all ages.</Review>

<Review>Good selection of plants and trees, though very pricey. I paid $60 for a fig tree. A week later I was at the Orchard store near where I live, and the Orchard store had the fig tree for 25 bucks. This place is a ripoff.

If you are a local small business and want to compete with the big box stores, your pricing should be competitive. Your business overhead should not be as high as those of big box stores.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I am a frequent customer to the Almaden Valley Nursery.  They high-quality plants and products.  The staff is very helpful.  In my experience, when one cannot answer a question, they find another staff person with the expertise.  In addition to plants, I now spend as much on the wonderful gift items available as you enter the store.  If you have shopped at the boutique at, for example, the Roberstville Carwash, then you need to try the AVN.  Jeni manages the gift shop.  There is a wonderful selection there of holiday decorations and handmade jewelry.  Additionally, if you are in to CA Native Plants (I am), you get a 10% discount if you show your CNPS membership card.  I special order native plants and they are delivered and sold at the same price of the nursery stock. I recommend the AV Nursery.</Text>

I have gone there 4 times so far every single time they use the smallest amount of ingredients for your sandwich. I ordered a Southwest steak and cheese and they gave me 1/2 of a scoop of meat. I asked for the full amount of meat on the wrap and got charged for double meat. I am not going to ask for more of each condiment after the place a tiny amount on my sandwich. Will not be going back there, I'll drive to another location.<//Text>

Last time I bought in that store, I ordered my sandwiches and when I got to pick them up they said that my order did not appear in the system but in my bank account the transaction had been carried out and the manager said that they could not give me my sandwiches or my money until my order appeared in your system? Seriously, I realized that she only cares about the money and not the costumers, she did not argue much so I had better ask my bank to make the claim, not more in that store.</text>

We ordered three sandwiches on there app at 11:45 and our food was supposed to be ready by 12:05, we arrived to pick up our food at 12:15 and they hadn't even started making it. We ended up getting our food at 12:40. Then when we got back to work to eat we found our sandwiches were made wrong. My advice is just go in to order so you can make sure your food is prepared correctly.<//text>

Absolutely horrible! I was spoke to in profanity. I placed an order for over $67 and was told I was a liar and never paid through DoorDash. I had several forms of confirmation (credit card, email and DoorDash app.) The gentleman was extremely rude, he had zero respect for women. I have never received such horrible service in my life. I did call DoorDash and they did apologize, even though it wasn’t their fault. (Very nice) I called DoorDash because Subway refused to make my food or give me a refund. When I spoke to DoorDash they said my order was marked as delivered. On my end it was stared as processing. DoorDash said it was an error on the store.

I had to go in person to Subway in order to speak with someone because they continued to hang up when I called!!!! Please go somewhere else! We have so many other amazing restaurants/food services in American Canyon. Subway AC is NOT what our community tolerates or is about!<//Text>

<Text>Worst service.
I place my order online and by the time I got there they told us that there was no order for me I show them that they actually charge me on my card but they still didn't do anything about it. I ask for a refund and the owner said no because there was no order for me.
There's a lot of mold by the soda machine we told one of the employees about it and they said they know about it but the owner doesn't want to do something about it.
Please don't visit this place it seems the owner cares more about the money that anything in general.< /Text><Name>Hell5ing</Name><Gmap_id>0x80850c7cb51a7ba7:0x93d0580bf7e1815e<//Gmap_id>< Pictures>

<review>It's good sandwiches I get to choose whatever I want whatever toppings whatever sauce whatever cheese so this is one of the few places that you can go and have everything exactly the way you want it and watch them make it right in front of you you can't really ask for anything more than that so yeah whenever I need a quick meal this is a good place to go.</review>< rate>

Ordered sandwiches. Usually we go in afternoon, late, and goes well. This time just newer server I think. Wasn't usual folk. Server was a little unsure and a part of the extra avocado I ordered went into trash as server evidently unsure how to get the avocado out. Other than that, good place to go for a sandwich and usually fairly fast and facility clean</review>

<review>This location is slightly better than the one by Walmart in American Canyon just down the road, but both locations are owned by the same person and neither accept corporate coupons that come out in the newspapers. We have not really eaten at either since they stopped taking coupons, not just because we can't get a bit of a deal, but because the principal of it all. If you are going to own a Subway you should follow what corporate puts out.< /review><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

The law office of Irene Ruzin was very professional, timely and helpful. All the associates I had talked with, knew exactly how to help me. They helped win my case and I am always going to be incredibly grateful for them.
My mother-in-law is fighting for her disability claim and when asked, I directed her to Ms. Ruzin's law offices.</text>

Words are not enough to express what a exceptional work both Francesca & Irene did.
After 2 long years of being denied I got approved. Full favorable benefits including back pay. Due to long distance, no driver & COVID I never had the chance to meet them personally, but it wasn’t necessary very responsive on phone calls, Email response within minutes.True professionalism I am beyond grateful. I will recommend them to anyone in need.
Thank you so so much! KP</Review>

<text>Irene and her staff were outstanding.  Facing disability is a difficult position to be in.  Irene and her staff made the process of applying and subsequently being rendered a fully favorable decision of SSDI easier for me.  They were with me every step of the way and were always available for questions.  Their professionalism was evident from beginning to end.  I would recommend the Law Office of Irene Ruzin without question.</text></record></dataset><record>

Irene represented me as we went into the hearing and it took the Judge only 15 minutes to render me a fully favorable decision. Irene was professional and very concise. She helped me understand what we were walking into and I felt confident with her as my representative. She worked our case the entire time. The wheels of justice will put you to the test in the pure slowness of the claim period. Know that Irene will get you to the end. I hope this little review helps you in choosing her.

Irene Ruzin did what no other attorney could accomplish.  I originally filed my case in 2011; with a revision date of April 2012.  She was able to get a favorable decision which ultimately will change my life.  I am so grateful for her knowledge and never giving up .  I will be happy to refer new clients.  Thank you so much for what you did.< /review>

Irene Ruzin provided excellent representation for my SSA Disability claim. My claim was accepted thanks to her diligence and attention to detail. I am pleased to say that I was not just a "Client," but a "Person." Anyone struggling with a disability claim will understand how important that is.

I would highly recommend her for representation.<//text>

Irene Ruzin Law Office for Social Security benefit supports are excellent, professional, and A plus services and support.   Irene herself and the whole crew are excellent during initial walkthrough process, very responsive to phone calls and emails, keep providing status update and never over promise.   I have been through social security benefit process couple of years and I don’t see any match, based on my experience, with Irene Ruzin Law Office.   I strongly recommend you start with her office as a first and last that wasting time with others.   All said, I have nothing but, good to say about her support and its outcome.</text>< pics>

<Review>Irene RUZIN is amazing and so is the staff. I had a very complicated case and was rejected by 7 other attorneys prior to her. She read beyond my paperwork to find not only the reason why I had a case but6 why I was getting rejected by attorneys. She knew this would’ve be a hard case but undoubtedly BELIEVED WITH ALL HER MIGHT I DESERVED IT!!! After a long battle IRENE BROUGHT JUSTICE TO ME AND MY CASE!!! Please know she4 will find every crack to get your story your hurt and your pain in. THANK YOU SO MUCH LAW OFFICES OF IRENE RUZIN!!!!

When someone is really good at what they do, people must give credit where credit is due. Irene Ruzin and her team is the IDEAL law firm any client can wish for. I have dealt with many, many attorneys in my job over the years. And I can absolutely say Irene, Francesca, Maria, Vickie and the whole team are that TOP 1% in their field. From the very first contact I had with them, I had very good feelings. They are very honest and very courteous. They listen and understand. Above all, they are extremely competent and professional. As specialists in their field, they are extremely competent and provide amazing legal services. I Absolutely Recommend Irene Ruzin and her team to anyone who has SSDI case. Thank you Ruzin Law Firm!<//text>

Irene Ruzin was highly recommended to my mom for help with the social security disability appeal process.   From day one, Ms Ruzin was outmost compassionate, professional and extremely well versed.  This includes her staff as well.  Ms Ruzin turnaround time to respond to questions and concerns was amazing, and rare in the industry.  She was patient and explained each step of the process, so my mom was at ease.   She consistently kept my mom updated.  Ms Ruzin representation of my mom's case at the appeal court proved to prevail and she secured my mom's SSD benefits.
Ms Ruzin!  Thank you so much for making my mom feel as she was your one and only client.  My mom is very very grateful to you!!!< /Text>

The office of Irene Ruzin, staff and Irene, were always available for questions. Through their superior knowledge of disability processes and requirements, they helped me to reach the finish line with a positive outcome.  I don't believe I could have asked for better.<//text>

<Text>My son Danial is relieving  SSI benefits because of the hard working, intelligent and caring, Irene Ruzin Esq.  If anyone can win a case it's Ms. Ruzin. She will find any opening in the system and break threw, then she will continue to care about the client even after the case is over. I can't say enough good things about her as a lawyer, and as a human being, with great maternal instincts.

< Review>
We used Ms. Ruzin a few years ago for our daughter to get her on disability because she had MS and is very much disabled.  She had been denied by Disability originally.  Ms. Ruzin appealed and won her some disability help.  Ms. Ruzin is very organized, efficient, ethical and knowledgeable and experienced at what she does and has good analytical skills.  She made the process very easy for my daughter, and we highly recommend her to anyone who has the same problem and needs to appeal.</Review>

My SSDI was just approved  in 03/2019  with  SSD attorney Irene Ruzin ! She is perfect to have helped me win so complicated disability case!  She Is Just Like Judge Judy to me! If you do need a SSD attorney,  just  post your case in details to her website, follow her what to do /not to do for your medical record & update,  great  chance  is in her hand for you! Don't waste your time ! Don't miss her! A  Big Thanks To All Of Office Team Irene/ Ann/ Vickie/ Maria!!</Review>

Do Not use this firm if you want positive results! Despite verbally explaining to Irene and her staff and jointly going over the case materials the staff was continually clueless going forward with our case including not knowing any information prior to going in to court appearance. We were forced to do all of the paperwork and filings our self on HER behalf because her office was not sending in the information that the courts were requesting. This firm is completely clueless and will waste years of your time.</review>

I have so much to say about the people who work here! When I first called to see if an extended warranty was going to cover my transmission it took 20 mins to get ahold of someone so obviously I didn't expect to have a good experience but I was wrong! Once I got through to talk to someone my tune had changed! Thanks to Mario he squeezed me in for an appt and we went from there. Mario definitely helped me out when I was about to freak out about my car lol He kept me informed on what was going on and when he wasn't there Michael and Dennis were available to answer any questions I had. My car was supposed to take an extra day to get done because those poor guys were short due to Covid but those guys hustled and my car was still done by original date.  When I went to pick up my car there was a how should I say it a "difficult" customer and those guys kept there cool and stayed friendly. I'm beyond happy with the service from Nissan Service Center!!  You guys have AMAZING  employees and wonderful service!<//Text>

<Review>Called the parts department and the guy on the phone was hesitant to quote me for a mass air flow sensor for a 2011 Frontier without me providing my VIN# (all frontiers from 2005-2015 use the same sensor, as well as most other models of nissan and infiniti part #22680-7s000) I told him that its the same for all of the models (and he should know that since its common knowledge for Nissan guys). I was quoted 300 for the mass air flow sensor (which is ridiculous). Hitachi is the part supplier for Nissan's mafs and they sell them directly for 50 dollars online. This place is charging 6x the price for the EXACT same part. I would absolutely research before dropping the money buying from here.

Thanks for the response.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It took a week before I could take my car in to be
digangosed.Then they said they would call me to let me 1 what the problem was (they didn't). I called and found out it was going to take a week to get the part in.  they couldn't give me a loaner car even though the issue was a transmission problem and a class - action lawsuit over this.Well the following week I end up calling and find out the part didnt come on but would be here the next day and my car would be ready by the end of the day.the next day I call and find out if still isn't ready and would be done the next day. The next day I call and an told it is being worked on but probably won't be ready until the next day. I finally had it and told them I need my car back.I was pretty angry and was told they would call if my carawas finished.Two hours laterI got a text.
1. They nevercall when they said they would
2. They didn't keep me up to date on delays or anything

My wife and are were very happy with our experience at Lithia Nissan of Clovis. Aaron was very friendly and polite and also extremely helpful. It didn't take long at all to get approved for financing and he didn't try and push anything that we didn't desire. It was definitely an enjoyable car shopping experience.< /Review>

Latoya & Tim are the reason I go to Nissan of Clovis to get my Toyota worked on! Best service advisors I have ever encountered at a Lithia dealerships. They treat you like family and go above and beyond. They remember me and my partner by name and always ask us about topics we talked about months before.

Keep up the amazing work guys and can't wait to see you next time!< /text>

LaToya is great! Very "customer service" friendly. Wouldn't change anything on that. Fred was kind and wonderful as well. Overall it was a good experience. The wait time was a little long, but I do understand why. No worries on my end.<//Review>

Amazing halal fried chicken place... kinda in the middle of nowhere. This place is a blessing to have in this particular location for Muslims traveling to / from southern to central California. It's almost an obligatory stop! Last time I visited, they fried the chicken fresh despite having some older chicken out, ready to go. Great customer service, delicious fried chicken, reasonable prices. What more could you ask for!<//text>

I was surprised how good it is actually was. I got the mashed potatoes and gravy on the side which is also really delicious but the portions in my opinion were on the small side. Chicken was great, I wish they would have added more occasion seasoning and more spice. I'll definitely come back here and I completely recommend it.<//review>

<Text>Man o man! I was looking for wings for Sunday football and I was pleasantly surprised! The food was pretty much made to order and the service was great! Was told I had to wait a few minutes for my order and I had no problem with that because I knew the food would be nice and hot! The wings are not for the faint of heart because you don't get those lil baby wings that I can normally eat with one bite! These were were big and my eyes were obviously too big for my stomach! I got 20 and will have plenty left for tonight! I will definitely be back! I really appreciated the warm service. These guys are good people and would suggest given them business!< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c27ed73e3367c5:0xe1726ee9e6cfeebc<//gmap_id>< user>

red Beans n rice and mashed potatoes is my favorite go to comfort food with the chicken. I mean Mac n cheese is always a debate as I can’t eat them all so I switch them out. Regular and naked Tenders are off the hook. Try the hidden menu (Corn on the cob) not so hidden now< /text>

I have stopped by at this place multiple times over the last couple of years on my way back to Sacramento and I have loved it every single time. Service is great, staff is polite and professional and most importantly the food is delicious. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some great fried chicken.< /text>

I was not too thrilled the first time, however I figured I'd try something different. I ordered a 6 piece Cajun Wings along with potatoes and green beans. The chicken was not cooked thoroughly. I overlooked the first piece and got to the second piece. I then became a little vexed. At this point my lunch is ruined as well as appetite. I took the food back to the counter where I explained to the owner by the name of Harris the situation and his response was that no one else complains about the chicken. The response was totally unacceptable. There was no apology nor did he even attempt to remedy the situation. Mistakes happen, however the lack of concern is what's  troubling me. I will never recommend this place to anyone. This is near a truck stop and I hope they dont make the same mistake.

Harris, I suggest you brush up on your people skills!</text></record></dataset><record>

<text>I ate here for the first time a couple of months ago but I didn't want to post without a good picture. I am always looking for a good place to grab cajun food. I have been here 2 times with my son and one time with a friend. Between us all we have tried the chicken, wings, shrimp, biscuits, fries, and red beans & rice. The chicken was cooked perfectly. The biscuits melted in our mouths. The chicken and shrimp were seasoned perfect. The fries were so good that you could eat them cold. My only 2 complaints were that the wings were not seasoned (but cooked perfectly) and I haven't been back because I'm on a strict meal plan. When I have my first opportunity to cheat, I will be returning. Good customer service and clean facility..important to me!< /text>< GmapID>

I would give this place 0 stars if I could. Just got home and dished it up and there was a cockroach in the macaroni and cheese. My 8 year old had started eating before we saw it and she is in years.</Review>

Best, and I mean BEST chicken I have ever had. I stopped in today with my wife, because she wanted  another chains chicken. We didn't know that it had changed to a non franchise operation. My wife and I agreed, much, much better than the previous franchise operation. Do yourself a favor and stop in..</review>

When they came out it looked like someone ate them for me. They were mostly bones. $8 for probably less than an ounce of meat. I’ll never eat here again.<//Review></record>

People were nice. Area was clean. Not your traditional buffalo chicken wings though. Theirs is just Country fried chicken and a couple small teaspoon size cups of sauce provided for dipping.12 wings with two dry biscuits for $17... over priced. Fair at best.</text>

<text>That was a waist of monney the chicken was not grate the potatoes has no flavor . The biscuit was hard like a rock . Dint even get my drink with the order .the cashier looked dirty as hell dint even put gloves on . There stations looked dirty . I'm all about first impressions and not impressed . The cashier looked bummed  out dirty hat on and cloths . Very unsanitary. The father I'm guessing came in and I noticed he didn't wash his hands after setting his car keys on the counter and removing his jacket .....    make a long story short I would not be returning to this place ever .       And also why does this place have a grade A on the window . Someone got paid good monney for that .</text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

GREY CHICKEN NASTY

Let me start off and say this use to be Popeyes and the owner was probably kicked out of the franchise for cutting corners and serving garbage, Now the food is beyond disgusting the sides are gross and the biscuit had the same consistency as a hockey puck. The chicken was slimy and grey one bite and I was done.

LOTS OF FAKE REVIEWS ON HERE BEWARE< /review>

I didn't know it was possible to screw up fried chicken. But it was bad. Biscuits weren't even good. And I won't even talk about the sides.< /Review>

Look, I dont eat vegan food, and I'm fat as all hell but I LOVE FRIED CHICKEN. Decided to stop into Cajun fried chicken tonight on my way home up the grapevine looking to fix this insatiable urge to put fried chicken in my mouth-hole. I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken batter was crispy, flakey and seasoned to near damn perfection. Meat was juicy, buttery and tender. It was Mardis Gras all up in my eat factory. Cole slaw was crunchy, fresh and delicious. I dont know what all the nasty banter is on these reviews but I'm definitely coming back. If you want to eat a tofu nugget whilst attending your yuppy-elitist yoga class, go somewhere else. Yer kind ain't welcome here.</text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Any good reviews are either paid for or from friends/family of the owners. Nastiest food in castaic, chicken was like chewing an old tire and the fish smelled and tasted at least a year past expiration. The sides had zero flavor. Clerk was wearig an old dirty tshirt and had the customer service skills of a vegetable. Dirty tables, dirty floor. Just gross.</Review>< Pictures>

It's ok, not great, not terrible, for the price you can go next door to the El Pollo Loco for non greasy chicken and better sides.< /Review>

It was ok. Not really thrilled. Was kinda dry and bland. Had to have hot sauce to add flavor. The dirty rice was really good though. Mashed potatoes ehhh. The gravy had a good flavor but there wasn't much of it. All in all... ehh!< /Text>

Went to Urgent Care to deal with vertigo issues.  I am from out of town but the admission desk handled everything efficiently and quickly. I was taken immediately to an exam room and was seen quickly.  The doctor was clear, concerned and extremely knowledgeable.  In and out in no time with sound information and help. Great office.< /Review>

I visited Urgent Care while traveling in Napa.  Everyone at the center was very nice and quality of care was excellent. Dr. Bellows was very helpful, and thorough during diagnosis and testing.  Definitely would recommend if you need medical assistance< /text>

Smashed my finger when moving a seat out of a van. Walked into this urgent care clinic and was immediately checked in and was in a treatment room in less than five minutes and walked out w stitches in about 30 minutes.  Everyone from the you young man who checked me in to the two assistants who took my vitals and cleaned the wound and the PA who stitched me up we’re professional, friendly and efficient in taking care of my injury.  I just hope my insurance has them in network!< /review>

With pic submission of insurance card and online forms you can fill out AFTER you schedule your appointment, the process is well worth the account . After initial setup online(3mins), you can call the site, snag an appointment from many available slots,  testing available car side, physician consultation via zoom, pcr and rapid test in same appt if preferred, they call with results in 30 mins and you call inc48 hrs for the labs. This is a relief and a half compared with establishments that have monotonous time sucking protocols that make basic care and tech available a pain to get even with full medical history and multiple requests for expedited options. Thank you for your awesome staff and knowledgeable medical professionals!</review>

Very friendly, I live in Sebastopol and nowhere in Santa Rosa would take my insurance for a rapid covid test. I called over tren places with this being one of the last and what do you know.. they take BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD PPO. staff was great, did an awesome job with my hands during the antibody test seeing how I have a chronic condition with them. If you are in the area and need immediate assistance I couldn’t think of a better place. Just don’t get lost in the road about</Text>

< Review>
I had quite the negative experience here. I fell and couldn't move my arm so I thought maybe I had broken it. I wasn't in excruciating pain, so I went to the local urgent care instead of the emergency room. Boy, was the a bad decision! It took a long time to be seen and I was stuck in a waiting room with about five people vomiting their guts out. I don't know what disease I could've contracted! When I finally was seen, I was taken to get an x-ray. Keep in mind, I could not move my arm without extreme pain. The x-ray technician was very rude to me as I was struggling to move my arm so they could get the proper x-ray. He tried to move my arm for me but I informed him that I didn't want to me touched. However, he continued to grab and twist my arm to the point where I had to yell, "Don't touch me!". Asking not to be touched is such a simple thing yet the rude and unprofessional x-ray tech couldn't do that simple, simple task.</Review>

Visiting from out of town, we didn't know any doctors in the area but were incredibly pleased by the friendliness and  professionalism of Dr Ahwah.  He took his time with us and made us feel like he had been our family doctor for years.  Thank you Dr Ahwah.<//Text>

<text>I've gone here twice and both experiences have been good. Wait times were not bad and the doctors were thorough and explained everything. Location is clean and comfortable. This is a great place to have when you can't get an appointment with your regular doctor for months out, but you need to see someone soon.</text>< Pictures>

I have visited here several times in the past. Always get great service, with short wait times. Today, I was seen by RN Christine and PA Aaron. Excellent experience! Christine was kind and genuinely a great caretaker. Aaron was absolutely amazing!! He was knowledgeable, empathetic, amazingly kind hearted!! I cant say enough good things about him!! You dont meet too many people like Aaron, a true gem!! I would highly recommend New MD Urgent Care.<//text>

<Text>This facility has the absolute rudest staff I’ve ever experienced. When I first arrived, I waited over 15 minutes for someone to even realize we were standing there. We could hear them laughing and gossiping in the back!  After we finally got to check in, We waited over an hour and a half for my sons appointment. Every time I asked the receptionist for an update, they had no idea what’s going on. Just kept saying “we’ll get to him when we can” Not to mention, the whole time he is speaking to me he is eating a HUGE burrito!! Gross!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Dr.Johnson was very down to earth and very through. My foot was swollen and painful. I thought it was from an insect bite, but the doctor quickly diagnosed a broken bone in my foot. I was provided a disc of my ex-rays as well as a boot to stabilize my foot  He recommended I see an orthopedic doctor. At the end of my visit the front office staff member had the name and contact phone numbers of a highly recommended ortho group near my home.</Text>

There was no line when I went. The staff was very helpful and friendly.

Okay for a “Doc-in-the Box”. Had broken ribs on a workers comp claim. Initial visit went alright.

Follow up appointment, not so smooth. I was scheduled for 10:30am appointment. All they did was take my temperature & vitals and the total visit was 90 minutes. Doctor could not refill my pain prescription because he forgot to bring his “triplicate” prescription pad that the pharmacy requires, so they asked me to come back Sunday or Monday. I was told he sent it to the pharmacy electronically, but had to follow up because the pharmacy never received the prescription. He did not have the authorization/credentials to send it. So an extra trip to the pharmacy is needed or I have to return to the NewMD location when the doctor has his “triplicate” pad.....
UPDATE:
So here I am back on Sunday, after calling at 9:30am and being told the prescription would be ready in one hour.
12;45pm the doctor is not here, he has left to go get his triplicate pad, this is three hours after it was supposed to be done already.< /Review>

<text>I had a very positive experience at this clinic.  I was seen by the doctor very quickly.  The tests I needed were done promptly and results available before we left.  I had to go to the Sutter ER for additional tests and the doctor phoned ahead to try to get me moved up on the wait list.  When that didn't work, he called me from cell phone (after the clinic had already closed) and directly me to another hospital in Napa with a much shorter wait time.  I would highly recommend this clinic.< /text><gmap_id>0x80850c64ab2d4915:0x42ebd508d95c11f5< /gmap_id>< Name>

Don't go there! The employee in front desk she didn't know any thing about what the care they give!! I went there with my husband and he have a bad rash on his face.. we ask the employee in the front desk if they have a special doctor for skin care and she said yes!! Then we paid 175$ and wait wait wait then the doctor came to us and told us to go to special doctor for skin!!!!
And he didn't even recommending a name or another place to go!! So we paid 175 dollars for nothing!! Just waist our time and money!!<//Review>

I went in with my mom and waited for almost forty minutes. At the time, I had an extremely hard time breathing and I was running a fever for the first time. When the doctor examined me, he claimed a diagnosis was just a harsh cough and prescribed me Tylenol. The next day, I was feeling extremely worse and I had to go to a hospital instead. They tested me and I was diagnosed with pneumonia. I was in shock and by that, I would not recommend going there. Go to a more trusted medical office.< /text>

<text>I found New MD Urgent Care while desperate for relief from a sinus infection. The docs took care of me with a great consult that taught me how to keep myself healthy after my prescription. My wife has also become a patient and we've always left happy and on the road to recovery. Thanks New MD!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I've been to this Urgent Care five times. I was refered by my doctor's office because evertime I needed medical attention it was a weekend when their office is closed. Each time I have been impressed with their PROFESSIONALISM. Be it staff or doctors, treatment has always been efficient, friendly, thorough, reassurive and attentive. I never felt rushed, all my questions were answered and I was treated with the utmost respect. The outcome of treatment was excellent, my confidence in this urgent care could not be greater. I highly recommend it.< /Text>< pictures>

Not only was the staff efficient and friendly, but P.A. Aaron who I saw with a huge medical issue, took the time to listen, ask lots of questions, actually examine me and then take action to diagnose my condition.  I don't have insurance, and had to self-pay, but I felt I got my money's worth and that's priceless.<//text>

I don’t do reviews, but I had to do this one because it was the worst experience I’ve had. They don’t care about you, they just want to charge you as much as they can. Please find somewhere else.< /review>

<Text>Unprofessional staff, the doctor who saw me was very rude and demeaning in her speech. She wouldn't listen to me talk about my symptoms and just wanted to brush off everything I said. She was very agitated from the beginning and even swung the door shut aggressively as she was leaving the room. She just wanted to rush me out and get paid and she gave me the impression that she really doesn't care about her patients. Perhaps she was having a really bad day but the way this doctor behavied is no way to treat a paitent, bad day or not. Bad experience all around.</Text>< Pictures>

Pros:
My doctor wasn't available so they referred me to New MD Urgeant Care.
Really surprised.
Very professional, clean, courteous as soon as you walk in the door.
Doctor was very knowledgeable and explained everything step by step.
Made sure that I had perscriptions and home care instructions before I left.
overall a great experience.

Cons:
Wait.

Long, long, long, wait! 20 mins to get called back & I waited in the Room by myself for another 38 mins before the Dr came in to see me. I could've napped. Lol!
The Dr was fine and efficuent, it just took forever for an "urgent care facility".<//text>

I asked if I could have an appointment because I only had a limited amount of time with my baby. They informed me that I could walk in and no appointment was necessary. When I arrive, they only then inform me that no doctor has arrived and they have no idea when the doctor would arrive. We wait an hour and after still no doctor arriving, we decide to cut our losses and go somewhere else. I can't imagine the healthcare you would receive given that the doctors can't be bothered to show up to their own practice.</review>< Pictures>

Stay away from this place!! Half of the staff was unprofessional and I was completely misdiagnosed by the doctor. I went in because my eye was swollen and felt bruised but I didn't have a known injury of being hit etc. There were two hard bumps inside my eyelid that were causing this irritation. When I went in to this facility and saw Dr Marisol Martinez, her advice was to simply ice my eye every few hours. Why am I paying $150 to not get a correct diagnosis and to just ice it!?!</Text>

This place is a joke! My appointment was for 2:45 and it is now 4:17 and I am still waiting to be seen. I will never come back here again first and last. Horrible service and staff I would rather drive to oakland and be seen at Goldeng gate urgent Care.</review>

< Review>
This place is the best!! I love how clean it is every time I go, I love the location because Adams Ave has some great spots to eat and drink. They treat me like family and they don’t look at me weird because I’m covered in tattoos, very professional and super friendly staff. Seems like it’s all females that work here and everyone is beautiful even my Doctor! But they have one staff member that is so sweet and Gorgeous!!!! I almost hope I get sick just so I get to see her.<//Review>

Just had a physical with one of their physicians.  Very professional, on time, and pleasant to work with.  Since I live in Normal Heights, clinic is within walking distance of home.  Highly recommend !< /text>

Horrible experience from the start. That office is a mess. I scheduled an appointment early September, when I show up they were confused and didn’t know why I was there and that I should have had a televisit . On the phone with the person who scheduled me she asked if I preferred to come in the office or do a televisit and I chose to come in since it was my first visit and I wanted to meet my doctor. At first when I showed up they tried to rush me off and said there’s nothing they could do since I showed up on time but with televisits I need to be 30 min early.... i asked since I was there if I could just sign in to do the televisit they said no..I was upset but polite and asked since I was there for my scheduled appointment if they could still see me. The dr approved and I was seen. The staff was short with me and hurried because it was the end of the day appointment due to my work schedule. I’m sorry but if you don’t want 5pm appointments when you close at 6 don’t have them...the only person that made me feel like I was welcome was Dr Kelsey. Thank you for that. She didn’t hurry me and listened to everything and got my past medical history (since this was an establish patient visit) she needed to send out a referral to a specialist which I thought was off because I don’t need one for my insurance..? Anyways. I waited a couple weeks and didn’t hear anything from anyone. I call the office today and they had THE WRONG INSURANCE IN THEIR SYSTEM!!! The staff didn’t want to help when I called to figure out what was going on.  Started getting snooty with me because I was of course frustrated and i had already called my insurance company to verify that I was correct. Everything is as it should be but they couldn’t pull up my insurance information. The guy didn’t want to deal with me anymore so he pushed me to billing. So now I have to deal with fixing their mistake and have wasted time waiting for the insurance to approve my referral. WILL NOT BE GOING BACK. Good thing I found this out on the first visit and didn’t waste too much time. This had to have been the most unwelcoming and frustrating Dr visit I’ve had. No one seemed to know what was going on.</text>

< Review>
The first visit here seems nice, they always have appointments available.... I've been a patient here for a few years now and getting anything done past the first appointment is extremely time consuming. I've had to constantly battle to get the treatment I need (and we're talking about simple things like a test or referral), their focus seems to be getting your copay and appeasing the insurance companies more than your actual care. I haven't switched yet hoping at one point I could find someone here that lives up to all these good reviews but I give up.<//Review>

Great experience! It was super easy to book an appointment same-day. The staff was extremely courteous, and the NP I saw was knowledgeable and kind. Will definitely be using this location's services again in the future (if I need it).< /text>

I was able to get an appointment with the Doctor I wanted to see within a week of when I made the appointment. The clinic is very nice, and Dr. Taylor was wonderful. She addressed all of my concerns and made me feel so welcome.

I found street parking down one of the side streets very easily, and it's in a really nice location with shops nearby.< /Review>

<Text>I just switched over to this group and went there for the first time on Monday and they were seriously AMAZING! It was super easy to get an appointment and I felt really comfortable with all the staff, which is something that I had never experienced with my old doctor's office. I saw Dr. Parrott and she was SUPER nice and attentive. I felt like she actually listened to my concerns, and she gave me options that were catered to my personal preferences. I also appreciate how thoroughly she went through the information with me, which allowed me to make the best decision for myself. The most efficient and welcoming clinic/doctor's office that I have ever been to, hands down!</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

This was my first visit to this clinic.  I was seen the day I asked for the appointment , showed up early to complete the paperwork, and was seen shortly after.  The staff was welcoming and  efficient.  The NP who did my exam took time to talk with me about what was going on and seemed competent to handle my complaint.  I recommend this clinic.</text>

I LOVE this office of the Perlman Clinic Group.  From the ladies up front, the intake nurses, the PA's and especially Dr Taylor, every time I go I feel welcome and my issues are heard.  I've been to three other locations and this is by far my favorite. Easy to get to for me (as the others are difficult in terms of traffic because of where I work and live).</text>

From start to finish, the team was welcoming, professional, and knowledgeable. After putting off a visit to the doctor's office for a little longer than I should, I felt totally at ease with Dr. Pierce and Dr. Taylor. I could not have asked for a better experience!</review>

I love this clinic! I have been twice for situations in which I needed to see a doctor quickly and my UCSD primary care physician was either closed or couldn't fit me in. Both times, Perlman clinic got me an appointment within 30 minutes. The very best part is that the two doctors I have seen were both amazing, knowledgeable, friendly, and comforting. I feel VERY lucky to have this place close by! Thank you, Perlman staff,  for such great service when I needed it most.<//Review>

I like this clinic and Dr Taylor in my couple of visits. However, I had an issue about my phone calls, verbal requests, and emails about medication refills. I kept reminding and leaving messages about the need to refill my medications. One time I missed my insulin dosages for a week before they refilled my insulin and anti-anxiety medication. Last week again my pharmacist in Costco send a refill for my accucheck strips but no response from the clinic. I left a message today about this issue and in the automated greeting it gave the on call doctor phone number. I felt that maybe the on call doc can help me out. When I called her she was obviously upset already by her tone of voice. She talked to me like a child with raised voice. I confronted her about her angry tone. After I explained to her my situation, in not so many words she stated I am not an emergency and she is only handling emergency cases. I am a nurse and a diabetic who is asking for a refill of my nano accucheck strips. I have not checked my blood sugar for one week now and been waiting for a refill prescription from this center. So I am giving them one last time to fess up this mess and I will definitely report these inefficiency and change my clinic. Thank you for your time in reading my comments.<//Text>

<text>I couldn't say enough about the Perlman clinic. It truly is so rare to find such dedicated and caring physicians not to mention the front office staff. They are always accommodating to my schedule and really wen my the extra mile to help make sure to get me in when they were completely booked. Thanks to all. Definitely recommend and encourage this clinic!!<//text>< name>

My wife highly recommended this clinic that I also recommend. I was able to schedule a same day appointment with a listening and insightful doctor will takes a sincere interest in my health and practical options. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. I look forward to working with them on my health goals.< /Review>

These guys are excellent!! I cut my hand and needed a few stitches. It was late Friday afternoon, New Years weekend and they were slammed! A regular emergency room or urgent care center would have undoubtedly been a wait for hours, but I was in and out with a stitched hand in about an hour. Great service, very friendly, and billed my insurance, no problem. These guys, from the Doc down to the receptionist, know how to get it done!</Text>

<Text>I'd really like to give it a minus 10, but 1 star is the lowest option. When I made the appointment to see Dr. Rogers, there was no mention of needing a referral. Even though the office staff was able to secure a referral on the spot, Dr. Rogers still refused to see me. Refused! She didn't even have the courtesy to come out and talk to me - she relied on her assistant to carry messages back and forth.

Days later I found out the office staff had made a follow up appointment for me without my permission and without letting me know. I'll bet they would have charged me a no-show fee when I didn't come in.

While I was in the waiting room, another patient came in without an appointment (there's a sign in the window that welcomes walk-ins). She was told there would be at least a 2 hour wait and she should go to the Hillcrest clinic instead. But I was the only one in the waiting room. She might have had to wait about 15 minutes since the doctor refused to see me anyway!

I suggest if you need medical care - GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!< /Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

When the young woman finally left the hall to come to the desk she gave me the third degree, paperwork and to come back at 4. All very cool. Really?Walk-ins welcome.

No problems with my second visit.

We were walk-ins to just check the place out and now we are clients.  Our experience was quick, pleasant and informative.  Just a short walk to the doctors is a blessing.   Check them out if you have any need for a MD.</review>

Nothing against the staff as people, they tried to be helpful but seriously, tell me an honest estimate of the wait next time. That way I can make the decision on my own to stay or leave rather than have the time drag on endlessly. Haven't had a bad experience at a Perlman clinic until now.< /Review><rating>1<//rating><Date>1516044476206</Date></record></dataset><record>
<text>I got an OK from my HMO and my
GP to go to urgent care and when I showed up, urgent care called my doctor for a referral, which my dr's office was expecting. They refused me because I had a dr I didn't want to see, and they told me I'd have to change doctors to be seen. That I neeed to call my HMO and change right then and there, or pay cash. I have 3 ins companies. It did not make sense to me so I quietly left and had to deal with my problem until I could reach my Doctor. Not only was I sick, but totally confused. Not good, I think the girls were not experienced enough to do their job, or they didn't understand what was going on. Called my HMO and they said it was ridiculous and to go somewhere else next time. I Will!< /text>< resp>

2nd endocrinologist with them leaving in a year. Get a letter a month before Megan Rogers will no longer be attending to patients at the office , to go look for another endocrinologist with appointments available 3 months from now . Lame.< /Review>

Needed a new Dr after moving and changing insurance. The Perlman Clinic staff and Dr Brangaccio have been great. Listing and helpful. Great to be able to book appointments online, review notes, etc. On time, easy to deal with. Very Happy with my move here.< /Text>

Wonderful, wonderful ,wonderful and w-o-n-d-e-r-f-u-l! Better than a mall! I love the goodies inside and you'll always find something! My mom and dad weren't kidding when they named the thrift stores, "The Goodie Shop." I'm loving the huge savings and big bundles I get to take home with me. They're prewashed, so they'll fit or not and donate again for another buying day of your choices too! I'm not those people who have to prove to have, but I am a person who likes class and extra savings who works hard, and teacher not a fancy big spender. The area's okay but then, what area isn't? I love my mall! Check it out wonderful wondering individuals!</Review>

They have awesome prices, but you have to go prepared; they only accept cash and personal checks! I would give them five stars, but everyone who works there seems to permanently be having a bad day.< /Text>

What's to say? Good food, no atmosphere. Small indoor dining area but more takeout. Parking is awful especially on weekend mornings.<//review>

<Review>We use this place regularly because we live next to it. It's good, but good Mexican food isn't hard to come by in SD. Prices have gone up a bit over the last 6 months too. The staff is always friendly and the food is ready quickly. If you're looking for "OMG, you have to try this place!" this isn't it (go to Pacific Beach or down around the Coronado Bridge for choice taco shops), but if you just want some quality Mexican at a fair price and you're in the neighborhood, this is your spot.
Unrelated note: It's not cash only, but there is an ATM inside.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80d95734fcafa757:0xef802851fe29e499< /GmapID></record>

<Text>Best thing about Costco Business is open at 7am!!!! Check the business hours before you go and be ready to see gigantic package of things that we don't see in a regular store.
But you can get the basic fresh fruits and vegetables,  and much more in the "house" size. It's worthy the experience 🙌</Text><gmapID>0x80dbffebd0652497:0x5add788bca9aa699< /gmapID>< user>

First time going to the Costco Business Center and was pleasantly surprised by the stuff I haven't seen at my regular Costco.

One of the items they sell is sausage crumble. If you make your own pizza, this is great for it.

Speaking of pizza,  the woman at the food court, was nice enough to customize my pizza for me.  I love the cheese blend of the cheese pizza, but they don't use it on the Pepperoni Pizza. She, and I'm sorry I don't remember her name, did the cheese pizza and then put the pepperoni on top. Awesome and thank you so much 😊<//Text>

The mints are not stocked in any of the other Costco warehouses at all, and lately this is the only place I can find diet Pepsi. If you need restaurants supplies, or are stocking up your home pantry, this is a great place to go. Their meat selection and other refrigerated items are so broad that there's a warehouse size room that's refrigerated :-) bring your coat :-)</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I love Costco. I had never heard of the "Business Center" before. It really is amazing to see. It has the familiar Costco feel but lots of cool items gears to small businesses. Things that really stuck out to me where all the different types of meat and drinks. I definitely plan on making the trip to shop here more.<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< date>

< Review>
I always like to get a hot dog and it comes with a drink, refills are free. $1.50 plus tax. About $1.63 total. Dogs are beef and big. They have pizza also. Can call in at some COSTCO STORES TO GET WHOLE PIZZAS TO GO. Other food also available, prices reasonable. No huge lines at this outdoor to go restaurant. Also, you can buy big packages of hot dogs inside the store. But I think you may need a membership card. All different priced member cards. If you bring a guest with you just need 1 membership card. Okay, and no, I don't work for COSTCO‼️HAPPY SHOPPING ‼️🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲👍👍<//Review>

<Text>Unique business focused Costco store. They sell large packs of food that a restaurant or business might need, however there are still plenty of options of you're just a regular consumer. No alcohol, clothing, or as much seasonal stuff as the regular stores but better selection on fresh, frozen, and pantry food.< /Text>< response>

<Review>Concession stand people were rude they had a I hate this job Tude. No smile no thank you. Well not from the employees anyway. We heard everyone in line say things like wow. What a negative attitude. And similar attitude. When a customer smiles & says thanks have a great day respond in kind is good here. If the customer is not in a positive mood responding in kind not so good but still be positive they may need it. And it is your job to try and please the customer they are your paycheck.

<review>They do not have the beloved Costco alcohol selection sadly. I get it, it's a business center focused more on restaurant and office supplies but it is California and many offices offer drinks for lunch or after work. It seemed to be less hectic and had better vibes than regular Costcos. Bottom line, I would still good here in the future for all of my household grocery shopping in the future.

Other than that it has some really cool items and bigger bulk selections of meat and produce you won't find at other regular Costco centers. Looked like they had some really good commercial cooking appliances. They also have heaters in stock which is a big commodity currently with all of the outdoor dining. The non alcoholic drink selection seemed to be a lot better than other Costcos as well.

The staff seemed to be a lot friendlier and more helpful than at the other Costcos as well. The door greater was happy to be there, people stocking were cheerful and happy, and the cashier made the process fun for everyone. I wish every Costco trip could be like this. Perhaps the customers are a bit easier to deal here, I don't know but whatever it is, it is working for them.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Always love going there, nothing excites the internal joy and happiness then buying in bulk.  Need some potatoes, how about 50lbs, need 5 gallons of soy sauce, in stock.  1000 mint toothpicks that too.  Don't forget a slab of pork belly with skin.

Don't forget to enjoy their massive walk-in refrigerator. A comfortable 40° all day long.<//review>

<rating>4</rating><text>Most times it's easy in and easy out. Because it's a business center most customers have loads of things on their cart (s). That being said the checkout is usually quick and painless. This depends on what time you are shopping. It doesn't have many of the products that the consumer Costco would carry nor does it have the samples that crowd the regular stores.< /text>< pictures>

< Review>
It was just after the holidays. I needed a box of baby wipes and also got some bananas. I was unaware membership had expired 7 days before. The cashier wa so nice and tried to have his supervisor/manager approve the small transaction, yet the supervisot said NO. I've been a customer of Costco for 10+ yrs never missed membership payment and could not believe supervisor didn't even try to help a loyal customer. Was very dissapointed and ended up going next door to Target intead and they were happy to take my cash.</Review>

When you need a business supplies. Costco has a lot to offer. The business centers are open from 7am, a great way to start shopping and it is very convenient to shop here. There are items that you can only shop from Costco business centers and not on a regular costco stores that opens at 10am<//review>

There is large quantities of items so if you dont have a lot of room in you fridge/freezer I don't recommend, instead, "Costo Wholsale".  The prices are amazing!  For example, the chicken thighs with bone in and skin is only 50 cents a pound and the container is 40 pounds!

<review>You want bulk?  You'll get bulk.  I think you only need a business card of you're buying business-levels of bulk, and you can go in there and get what you'd get from other Costcos, but they don't have everything you would see or get at a Wholesale, mainly pre-prepped food.</review></record>

<text>Business Center Costco is not for everyone. You'll find that this location is geared toward restaurants and mini-mart type operations. Don't think for a second that you can do your monthly household shopping here. I'm always surprised by how many patrons come in expecting to find all their regular Costco items here. If you want to find a wide variety of snack foods in single-serving bags, candy, gum, mints, or a huge variety of soft drinks, this is your place. If you're looking for items to stock your large office with basic office supplies, frozen and non-perishable foods, coffee and tea, this is your place. Need to supply your deli? Need a dozen #10 cans of tomato sauce? Need four kinds of sweetener packets? Perfect place. They DO have a walk-up food concession here so you can still get that low-cost lunch item and a fountain drink here. Prices are the same as the retail membership sites.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I am in love with this place! It has everything I need and some more stuff that other Costco’s I have been to don’t have! I would definitely rate this a 5/5.</review>

Everyone loves Costco. But the business center is slightly different. You can buy 32 pounds of sour cream, massive amounts of chicken, and commercial grade cookware here. It has many of the things you may normally find at Costco, minus any "home" stuff. Food, however, is offered in larger bulk on many items. The hours are also a bit different.</Review>

I come here all the time to get the stuff needed to run my restaurant. In my opinion, costco is better then the restaurant depot and that is why I do the bulk of my shopping here.</Text>

< Review>
I enjoy Costco because they have excellent prices and I'm forced to buy in bulk. which is fine with me. Especially when it comes to dry goods I'll go in there and buy a whole Year's worth of toilet paper paper towels napkins you-name-it.  non perishables. I enjoy the fact that I'm getting much better prices than I would at the grocery store.<//Review>

Typically quieter than the traditional Costco stores bc there are no benefits with samples, no lunch Cafe, no clothing, etc for sale. It's truly for businesses. Lighting and layout aren't as pleasing a shopping experience, but it's a good stop to purchase random commercial grade kitchen wares, large box size items, etc.</text>

This business center is well organized. It appears to be targeted more towards the restaurant and deli clients. For individual shoppers there are lots of good deals that don't have to be purchased in bulk. Many items found here are not available at the regular Costcos.< /Review>

The fridge section is huge and they even have courtesy jackets at the door. Large cuts of meat and huge cheeses and so much more. I was able to find my favorite cream puffs here that I couldn't find at our regular Costco. I won't need to come here all the time, but sometimes for a few special super bulk things.</Review>< rate>

Wider variety of bulk products including bulk meats, cheeses,  rolls, drinks (no alcohol). Shorter lines and better prices on meats as compared to other Costco's<//Review>

Always easy to get exactly what you need once you have the place "mapped out" in your head. They are rarely if ever "out of stock" like Wal-Mart always seems to be!! Go pricing and you can grasp a quick bite to eat after. What's not to like? Love getting that $500 rebate at the end of the year! Just makes it all worthwhile..< /text>

Good service, always busy. Easy street access, but parking is tight due to numerous businesses in the area. Service seems to be better than at other Costco stores, maybe because it's a business oriented store. Great selections.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Great location if you're a business owner or say a corner market. also greater here throwing big parties for example hamburgers because they have cut up onions and tomatoes in big platters ready to go. The selection of items in this store is comprable but different to your regular Costco.

Stop by and check it out if you're in the area.<//Text>< Pictures>

It is not for household. It might be run for business like restaurants. Most of items are big and too much for individuals.
There are some items enough for people. But it  have to be better going normal Costco.<//Review>

<text>This is the single Costco business center in San Diego. They have a little bit different goods than Costco wholesale. Mostly it is for restaurants and businesses. Costco wholesales are more convenient for non business. For the same products prices are also differ. If there is a discount on wholesale center it does not mean it will be in business center. Also sizes are quite big. In business center they have a lot of staff for small business and restaurants. Outside they have food court which is same and offers same staff as in wholesale centers. There is no Costco petrol or car wash in business center. Waiting time in cashier's line usually are longer because main shoppers are shopping for business.</text><Time>1562568773069< /Time>< Resp>

<review>This Costco is my go to location whether I am buying product for one of my businesses or need to pick up a couple of items for personal use. Every staff member that I have interacted with here has been super helpful and seemed less stressed than staff at other more busier locations.

This is a great place for mass shopping for businesses. you don't necessarily find the same items that you would add a regular Costco. There are some of the same.< /Review>

<review>Love the new feature at the gas station that shows which pump of the three at each of the lines is available. They have added electronic information boards to the posts and as soon as a car leaves the pump, the space lights green on the sign, making it easy to choose a line which speed ls up the whole fueling process. Well done, Costco!</review>< pics>

I'm talking whole sheep carcasses, 100 pound bags of potatoes and so on. They also sell commercial appliances and cookware like you would find at a kitchen supply store. They do carry "home sized" items and things different from the warehouse stores. There is not a large overlap between the two types of store. The business store is well worth a visit and the one I go to is clean and well run.

<review>The place to go if you need several dozen pounds of pork for under 2 dollars a pound. Have you ever been to a Costco and thought to yourself: damn, I wish that 6 pound package of pork was 20 pounds instead?  Well have I got the place for you. This place sells food and beverages in an industrial size scale. So whether you own or manage a hotel or a restaurant, or you just need to feed a small village or an extended family numbering in the dozens, this is the place to get all your foods and beverages. The freezer room in this place is massive, like several thousand square feet massive, so bring a winter jacket if you wanna browse inside. I don't even wanna think about what the energy consumption is like for a freezer that big. Enough to make Al Gore cry for all the hydrocarbons burned to maintain a steady temperature of 4 Celsius.<//review>< Pics>

Friendly staff, clean store, and moderate selection that can vary from the other Costcos in town, and by time. If you're liking what you find, buy a bunch, as it might be gone next week.< /Review>

Found what I wanted after an extensive search.  It's for businesses.  Everything is in huge boxes (even more so than a normal Costco.  The place is laid out strangely.  The snacks are on the front of the store but biscotti is in the bakery section in the rear.<//Review>

Costco is the best! A great selection of business oriented merchandise at amazing prices, easily beating many process I found on Amazon. Best of all, any regular member can shop here.

They have almost everything you need for office and food service, in large bulk quantities.

Highly recommend stopping by here if you've got a large event planned and need catering supplies or anything else.</Text>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I understand this is the only Costco Business Center in San Diego. Very businesslike. No food tastings, no pharmacy or side shops, except for the food service on the west side with the $1.50 hot dog staple.

The cold room is massive and set at 40 degrees. Coming in from the humid and overly hot summer, it was an awesome treat, until the lack of sleeves beat some sense to walking away. Package sizes extend to larger sizes for meats. Be prepared to get some great deals that will need to be shared.</text>< Response>

<review>Love this Costco!  I call it the 'secret' Costco because it is never busy.  It is the Business Costco - BUT you don't have to have a business to go here.  They don't sell all the clothing and books and some other 'typical' Costco goodies ... BUT they offer a bunch of other cool goodies.  I've even found a few items cheaper by a few cents compared to the regular Costco.  It TOTALLY is worth your time to go and do a field trip up here!!<//review><rate>5<//rate>< resp>

Whenever i go to the Costco Business Center, it has always been a very fast, and not really busy place to shop. Compared to the regular Costco's, if I had a choice, I would come here compared to the others every time. This one is about 20 minutes away from me, but it always worth it to go here. It's a great place to shop.</Text>

I love going to this Costco when I'm not looking or anything but grocery items. As others have said, this warehouse is geared more towards catering businesses and doesn't carry the full complement of products one associates with "regular" Costco. The real reason I love going here when I'm in the area is that the lines to checkout are usually always short. Makes it so much easier to get in and out!</text>

<Text>Love the Business Center because it is always way less crowded than the regular Costco's. This location does not have all the stuff the other ones have because this is geared to business owners. You will not find TV's, jewelry, clothes, or things like that. You will find a ton of candy, bulk boxes of chips (for vending or sandwich shops), tons of drinks, Coolers, ovens, deep fryers, and things of that sort. Not where you want to go for your everyday shopping, but exactly where you want to go if you are in the vending of food industry.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dbffebd0652497:0x5add788bca9aa699< /gmap_id>< time>

Great place to get restaurant supplies, ovens, blenders, plates and utensils, uniforms. You can also find large cuts of meat not generally available at a regular Costco such as a whole lamb, entire beef loin, large boxes of a particular cut of meat, Etc. You get the picture. An occasion you can also find great values on refurbished TVs and such.

The parking here needs some work, a lot of the spaces are too small for regular size cars and there's not enough of them.

The Costco food court is here and offers the standard fare at the same great prices.</Text>

It's a great place to buy beverages.  They offer a limited product line for personal use in comparison to that of a regular Costco, but this location is catered to a specific customer base.  There are also many products specific to commercial use that would not be sold elsewhere.< /review>

<Text>Love Costco! This is their business Costco. Its mainly for restaurants to buy wholesale foods. All Costco members can go here and make purchases. Best part is the meat department (if you love meat like i do).  I buy bulk packages and use a vacuum seal system to make smaller portions. Lots of stuff for packaging and serving food. You can get restaurant appliances as well as cooking utensils.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Waited more than 15 min to purchase a membership.  Store seems woefully understaffed and employees seem stressed.  Not the environment i care to spend hundreds of dollars in month after month.  Fortunately, the time spent waiting in line wasnt totally wasted-- i looked up other stores in the area that put more emphasis on customer service and employee satisfaction.</Review>

<text>By far the best Costco in town for food, cleaners, household goods.....
Lots of stuff you won't find in the other locations in San Diego - including industrial grade restaurant equipment.
No sample ladies here! This place is all about business.</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUQYr4OKBz9o6Rg9-DgR7RNjGyRaoOTmFUBxCY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

So much less busy than other Costco's. Obviously, since is geared for businesses, you can't get all the same items you can at other Costco's, (i.e. jewelry, clothes, etc.), but it works for me when I need a quick stop for basics, (toilet paper, laundry detergent, fruits, veggies, eggs).</Review>

This place is wonderful for large businesses and small businesses. It's great for things you may need to host a party, or if you run a catering company. It keeps the traffic down for those who really need to take care of business. Has an awesome kitchen section with industrial sized everything.</Review>< Gmap_id>

One of my most frequently visited Costco in the area, since it opens much earlier than Costco warehouses. Most items are for business guests, so even larger and more in a pack than a regular Costco, but you can still shop for basic household items and produce when you get used to their items. I like the ability to shop things early here and do other things later in the day.<//Review>

For those of you with learning disabilities; This is the BUSINESS CENTER. Therefore the selection offered is based on feedback from the business owners that rely on this store to supply their businesses. See the trend here? Business. If you are Sally homemaker looking to spend your food stamps on bulk alcohol, this is not the store for you. Love the selection and service for actual business owners here. They allow anyone with a Costco card to shop here. Enjoy the speed and selection but save the ratings for the business clients. Thank you and God Bless.<//text>

Different from your normal  costco, no tvs, no clothing, but has more selection of snacks, candy, drinks, restaurant/food containers...not as crowded either. It does have an outside food area as the other ones.<//review>

As good as any Costco but many items are only available in very large sizes. The inexpensive cheddar cheese is 5 lbs only for example.  They have more selection then some of the other Costco in the area. We found the Kirkland frozen blue berries here but not in the store near us.</Review>

Costco business, limiting their merchandise to items one might need to perpetuate a business as opposed to bulk consumer goods allows for faster checkout times and a quicker shopping experience.</Text>

Friendly staff and just the right amount of necessities for my home makes this place a gem, and a reason to skip the crowds at a the regular warehouse.   It's close to home too, so if we happen to run out of coffee, a quick jaunt over takes no time at all.  Again, it's mostly bulk business items, but they have essentials like fruits, veggies, bread, coffee, snacks and condiments. I have noticed occasionally the regular warehouse is cheaper on some things and their sales aren't concurrent... So do your research before you buy.</Text>

<text>The Costco business center has far more items that are just for businesses then regular Costcos. I was looking for free-standing shelves, and in regular Costco warehouses, there would be three, maybe four. In the Costco business center, there were, I believe about 8.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response></record>

Selling my stock asap assuming that someone like that should know better. Thought you guys, were on the up and up, but with management incompetence...good luck. Hiring within the company sometimes doesn't work. Find a competent management team, and i might reinvest. For now you lost a customer...look at my account...I spend thousand of dollars every month. Stupid is as stupid does. Education is important especially in management. Losing large customers is simply math...Bad math. Hope your superiors read this, so they know why your numbers are down
PS- when the manager is sweating in a interview...probably not a good fit

<Text>Wouldn't receive my return. The employee said "because they where a business Costco that they weren't familiar with the clothing and couldn't take my return." I had the receipt and bought it only a couple days ago. If you are returning items from another Costco don't go here. I was very disappointed I thoght I would be able to go to any Costco and return items from another one. I'm going to return it to the one I bought it from.<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>There are items available that I can't find anyplace else. In addition they carry items that the regular Costco carries. This is convenient if you need a variety of things so you don't have to go to both stores. There are demos at the business center so you can try foods or see a product demonstrated.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dbffebd0652497:0x5add788bca9aa699</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is a business center and not a typical Costco warehouse. You will not find clothing, sports equipment, liquor, a Etc like in a warehouse Costco. However they do have kitchen equipment that you will not find and a wider variety of snacks Etc. I prefer the warehouse over the business center< /Review>

Almost better than the regular Costco. Not as crowded and they sell restaurant quality kitchen gear. Good selection of cooking oil. They don't have a tire center or sell alcohol. Door staff/receipt checkers sometimes seem crabby. If you get here early enough they have complimentary coffee at the front door. Food court here as well.</text>

<Review>Love this place... It carries stuff that the regular ones have, but also stuff for your business (if ya have one or... Not).
I'm actually here on a weekly basis, buying stuff for home and the the local VFW Post that I do some cooking at.
I only have one stop other than this location that I do most of my shopping.
I can tell you that the people who work here are personable, friendly and helpful.</Review>< username>

Not a full fledged Costco - Business only. Definitely not your typical Costco visit = no samples. But there is still a lot of things that you can get here and the best part is that there's hardly ever any lines.<//Text>

Down side,  the new hires outside are a bit lazy.  Dont care to help you load unless u ask front door guy for help out.
They avoid making eye contact if they see you struggling as you load.

Wide selection of items here, but they also have products for businesses. Even if someone doesn't own a business, this store is also for the regular Costco member, as they will find almost everything that's in a normal Costco store. Great place to go to, even for things they might not have at the other locations.</text>

Great Costco with items not found in regular stores.  Commercial kitchen items, restaurant Quality Meats, and individually packaged cheeses instead of combination packages. Quite the experience.< /Review>

So this Costco is a little different then you’re normal Costco it opens at 7AM and it caters to small/ medium size business.  It is good for people who are looking for office supplies or restaurant/food supplies in large quantities. They sell to go boxes, pizza boxes, buffet hot plates, and food in larger quantities. There is a large selection of candy, snacks, sodas, energy drinks and it also has a food court. At this Costco they do not carry clothes and they do not have a pharmacy at this location.
Their hours are limited and closed on Sunday's. Also... no samples!<//review>

<review>If you ever find yourself needing something from Costco at 7am, then head to the Business Center. They stock most of the food and office supplies off a regular Costco but not the "snooze or lose" merchandise. They have a phonomenal selection of soda and energy drinks (by the case) and snacks and candy. They carry restaurant quality pans and equipment at affordable prices. The office supply area is also worth a look.</review>< Pictures>

This Costco has no clothes and has tons of snacks and drinks, catering more to businesses.

They have a ton more stuff than all the other Costcos like chips and drinks.  They're closed on Sundays and early on the weekdays.<//review>

Great place, less crowded than a normal Costco with only business type items.  Like the original Costco.  No alcohol, no house hold items, no cigarettes, no electronics.  Awesome meat and produce selection, where restaurants shop.</Text>

I love this place for grabbing a quick snack.  You don't even have to be a member to get cheap food outside.

They don't have a lot of the grocery stuff, but if you know what you want is there it's faster in/out than a regular costco.</Review>

A very big Costco store. With plenty of parking. This location is a little different than the others being that it is a business center. So the quantities of items sold are usually even more than usual and the items differ a bit than other places. This location also has a food court. The parking lot is large and plentiful it rarely gets full. The freezer section here is huge and they even offer jackets you can wear if it's too cold.<//review>

Easy in and out. Less crowded than regular Costco's since it's mainly aimed at business customers do any Costco member can go here. They don't have the free samples but I think that helps keep crowds away. It's a different selection than other Costcos. More meats and no electronics.< /Review>

My experience relates only to the food court. Pizza tasted so bland, there were various slices without enough cheese that you could see the crust. Also, we  purchased a vanilla yogurt sunday and just from the way it looked, it was not something you can enjoy. Yogurt was a dark yellow color and that is not the ussual color or texture. Only one register was open and eventhough the line was really long , another register was never opened.<//Review>

Good for small business but you’ll still probably have to go to an office store for all you office needs. They also don’t price match the regular Costco as they are different branches of the company</review>

Going to this Costco for the first time is like going from normal grocery store to a Costco times 10. Have you ever seen a 50 pound bucket of peanut butter.

Great place to shop for anything and everything that you would find at a 7-Eleven or Kwik-E-Mart.< /Text>

So I google Costco BC and get exited to find out the open til 8:30 PM right..I leave my office @ 5:45 PM after traffic and a lame crash I get there in 40 minutes (no big deal) to my surprise the BC in now closed ( a little cuss word here and there) I asked the cart girl for the hours and she's supper nice letting me know they close at 6:00 PM. Well.. whatever it's my fault for not calling ahead right, so this morning I called them to let them know the hours posted on google are incorrect and misleading people. The reason for the one star is not that the posted hours are incorrect it was the customer service lady's response. she said oh yeah! we get that all the time! now I lost my sh... thoughts...< /text>

<Review>This is a mini Costco. They cater to businesses, esp restaurants. Don't carry everything you'd find in a full size Costco. No pharm, food bar, tires, or opthalmologist. It's a lot less crowded than the full size store.</Review>< pictures>

This is not your average Costco. This place is squarely aimed at the business crowd. Really awesome prices on meat and produce, but the sizes will only make sense if you are trying to feed a small army. No samples, no tires, no gas.< /Review>

Good parking, very clean costco, and staff is top notch. Food court on the side, and ability to pay for the food court food at the checkout line and pickup. They take phone orders for pizza, so call ahead to avoid a wait.<//Text>

Anything you need for your business and more. When I just need quick simple items I normally get at a regular Costco I come here. It's less of a hassle and normally the place is somewhat empty as far as customers go. Meat selection is plentiful, dairy variety is huge, and you can purchase pre-cut vegetables for those events you hold at home. It also carries items regular Costco does not have which can be a good thing or a bad thing. I think it's worth the trip even if you don't buy anything.<//review>

<Review>If you're willing to purchase items used for business and in restarants then this is the place to go. Products are sized larger than what you find at regular Costco. Parking is free and check out lines are seldom very long. They also have a Food Court outside.<//Review>< GmapID>

It is always great at either Costco I go to.
My only complaint is there are items I need at both Costcos and and they both don't carry the same items,  making me have to do double shopping. In these days and times,  and with the traffic being SO terrible,  time away from your family which is already limited makes you consider going to a one stop shop of another chain.  Sorry Costco.< /Text>

Tucked away off o Convoy this Costco is less crowded than a traditional Costco. It carries most of the same stock with some exceptions like no fresh produce. It also has a food court with the same pizza, hot dogs, etc.< /review>

It is Costco, the name we all know and members visit.
It started as a business center mainly geared toward the needs of businesses - offices, restaurants, etc. But since then it has added more consumer items, i.e. veggies, fruits, meat, etc. that we can buy from regular Costco stores.
As it is close to my office and home and it carries most of the stuff that we need for our family, I have started going to this store more often and less often to other Costco stores which are a few miles father away.< /review>

Not a regular Costco, business stuff mostly. Use your regular Costco card to get in. If you're planning on getting the regular Costco merchandise you will be disappointed, but if you need business merchandise, this is the place to go. The have a food area too.</Review>

<userid>116233538932653603204<//userid><Response>None</Response><review>I occasionally visit the Costco Business center because they have some different items than my normal Costco center. I don't own a business, just shop for my family here. Some items I get here include individually packaged snacks for the kids (they have many more options of potato chips, bars, pretzels, popcorn,etc than the normal Costco), coffee flavorings by Torani, and drinks (they sell 48 LaCroix packages that are all one flavor vs regular Costco sells a mixed pack with the lime flavor in it that none of my family likes). They also sell different Frozen and refrigerated items that may be of interest to other families like mine, for example Lunchables, tater tots, soft pretzels.
Things you should be aware of, it's even more no-frill than the regular Costco. They have tons of items that might be of interest if you worked in a commercial kitchen or owned a convenience store (candy, beverages, take-out containers, large cuts of meat, huge quantities of certain produce).
*They do not sell any alcohol at this location, fyi.<//review>< date>

I like the business Costco because my regular membership works there and it is not usually as busy. They also have some different items then the regular stores. Of course, everything is still Costco sized!</Text>

My son turned me on to this Costco and I really like the way the store is laid out and the ease of finding items and the people willing to help when you cant find something. 5 stars for me.< /Review>

Worthy alternative to consumer Costcos harkens back to the chain's origins with cases of vending machine fare,  soy sauce and Nutella in bucket denominations, and whole lambs and goats. Other highlights include commercial kitchenware and flatware at a fraction of All-Clad or Oneida prices.< /review>

I was in the mood for a chicken bake the other day but when I got one from the Costco in Kearny Mesa it tasted really funky. About an hour later my stomach really started to hurt. I went back and complained (yes I am weird like that) they were nice enough to give me a $10 coupon. It helped boost their rating from one start to two stars...<//Review>< pics>

This is what a Costco should be! I love this, no lines, few people, amazing prices, and big bulk food items. The selection here is very different from the normal CostCo, more like what PriceClub was back in the day.</text>

It's unusual place from the standpoint it's not like a regular Costco it caters to businesses rather than homes if you're having a party with a lot of people definitely go to this Costco they can supply you with the food you need at an extremely reasonable price and a variety like no other</text>

Love this place you can get in and out pretty quick for a Costco. Only drawback is they don't carry everything a regular Costco does.< /Review>

This Costco is a business center, so they don't have all the house goods, but have more snacks and restaurant supply stuff. Short lines and well staffed.</Review>

< Review>
First off, this isn't a regular Costco. Don't expect to find all your usual items. This location is geared towards business customers. It still has a food court and several standard items. I like buying items from this location, because you typically cannot find them anywhere else.< /Review>

First off, this isn't a regular Costco. Don't expect to find all your usual items. This location is geared towards business customers. It still has a food court and several standard items. I like buying items from this location, because you typically cannot find them anywhere else.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) It's a business center, you can find something that you can't find in normal Costco. You can go shopping with a Costco membership card. This is the Business center, so there are some products that Costco doesn’t usually have (of course, some products are the usual Costco Yes but not here).

It’s a business center, you can find something that you can’t find in normal Costco. 有Costco 會員卡就可以逛，這邊是Business center ，所以有一些平常Costco 沒有的產品（當然也有些商品是平常的Costco 有而這邊沒有的）。< /Text>
