<text>Happy hour goes until 8, which is awesome because happy hours that end at 6 aren't very happy. Well cocktails are $6, beer specials are $4 and wine is $6. We got a few orders of onion rings, too. Ambiance is dark and cozy and the bartenders were all very nice and friendly. I was surprised we could get seats at the bar and it wasn't more packed at happy hour time than it was.< /text>< Pics>

Really Nice hookah lounge , great hookah flavors ! Chyll place to hang out with friends. Good Music , Good Vibes. Only thing is there's a line where you wait to get In. It's pretty long. There's also only one restroom so don't hold it in for too long because there's a huge line for the restroom aswell.< /text>

This is a nice place to meet up with friends after work. I would suggest it as a lounge to visit in Hollywood. Dress code is normal for a lounge, no shorts. I'm sure this is a great place to visit in the summer because of the large pool in the middle.< /review>

This is one of the few bars in LA where I can actually stay until closing! They have a beautiful view of the city which is going to hard to come by with all the construction happening off sunset.There is a entrance on Sunset, that only sometimes has a doorman, don't know why...b but you can easily enter through the Mondrian entrance. Just head straight back and it will be on your right. there are plenty of couches outside and a smaller covered seating area generally reserved for parties/bottle service, by the bar. The waiters and hostesses are friendly. Restrooms are "downstairs" to your left, or straight ahead when you first enter through the roped off entrance. Drinks are a bit pricey, but they are heavy pours..how I have not seen someone drunk fall into the pool or tumble down the stairs I don't know. A good place to people watch, have a sexy drink date, or mingle with friends.</Text>

I've gone here for big events such as the Corona Electric Beach events as well as the Wicked Paradise events here, seeing some of the coolest DJs such as Illenium, Prince Fox, Cheat Codes, and Tim Gunter. It's also really easy to get up close to the DJs at the dance floor. I usually go to Skybar to dance for these kind of events rather than swim so I can't speak for the swimming pool. However, there are a lot of cute floaties here. They had a great bucket of Corona special one time I came here, as well as a margarita deal another time.</review>

This hookah bar is turned down they don't sell drinks or food and it's always regulars that's just turned down. It's overpriced only because it's near "Hollywood" you'll be putting out about $25 for a hookah with tobacco for two people only and if you're 18 you're only smoking the non-tobacco hookah which is $21 and some change either way I suggest you go buy a vape.< /review>

Quite on an early Friday night. 21+ to smoke hookah w/ real tobacco. 18+ for alternative, but you can't sit with anyone smoking tobacco. Maximum of 3 per hookah, so parties of 4 must order 2, unless you get a premium hookah. Non smoker pay a $5(?) Sitting fee. I've never been to a hookah lounge with so many rules. Not sure if this is standard at other lounges, but it was new for me.</Review>

<text>The service is great! Staff is friendly and very helpful, knowledgeable and caring... they are quick, the hookahs are clean, nice and flavors are excellent. The price is very good too, happy hours monday - friday, and staff pays attention when new coal needs to be brought. They're quick, they pay attention to your needs. Hookah lasts for a while here also! The music and environment is chill asf. I travel from the San Fernando Valley to kick it here. Keep it up guys, and i highly recommend this place to go.<//text>< GmapID>

This place has a great selection of cigars. I have had nothing but good experiences with Manny and I would recommend this place for those who appreciate a great cigar at great prices.< /Review>

I don't know why I waste my time with other shops. It is a ways for me to get there....BUT, Manny always has what I need, I have hard to find glass & coils.
It is definitely worth the drive. Thanks Manny, great customer service too!<//review>

I shop here at least once a week and have always had a great experience. The owner is always very nice and willing to answer any questions or provide any help you may need. This place has an amazing selection (always spend at least 30 mins looking thru store) and if there's anything you may need that he doesn't have the owner will special order exactly what you want. To top it all off their prices are very good and have stopped going to other smoke shops. Stop by you won't be disappointed.< /review>

<text>if you buy it here it will break .One of the worst customer service places in the world.I have bought a couple things there and all of them broke.They rip you off on price and glass is garbage .I bought a 150 dollar rig that broke at joint in 4 days.The dude working there most of the time is freakin clueless .I tried to give them another try  recently and he wasn't even in the shop. I waited by door till he came back in and after trying to overcharge me for a cheap battery cause he looked high as hell .He had to check the cash drawer before i left like im a freakin criminal .I hope that store makes no money .Nothing but cheap chinese crap with no warranty.Ill never step foot in there again and i have told everybody i know to stay away .</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Bought a vape here worth 49.99 online for 129.99. Came Out to 140-something. I wasn't aware how badly he was ripping me off. When I found out, I tried to return it unopened with the receipt from a few days prior.
The guy is the same guy who is always there. At first he tried to telle that online isn't as good as him because they might not have or send you the right colors, while he only had white and purple. Also online is terrible because shipping costs more and takes a couple weeks.
He charged me almost 3x what this thing is worth. I didn't even have a chance to respond because he heard himself and knew he sounded like a moron, so he told me he has rent and bills to pay. Yeah, so do I. I knew buying in a store would have the thing marked up but that anount is just greedy. Scumbag.

Finally he admits that HE BUYS HIS VAPES ONLINE, so that's "his" price. That's how much he pays for them. He knows he marked it up too much and gave me a couple free juices, but I really didn't want them. I wanted my money back. I suspected he wouldn't let me before I went, as it's a cig and vape shop, but the way he went about not gicing me my refund was super shady and messed up, and he knew it. This guy is the worst and he knows it. Now I might as well use the damn thing since I'm stuck with it but it is just going to upset me to have it. Never going to this place again. I wish I could leave zero stars.< /text>

< review>
I tried to give Mindy the benefit of the doubt, but she burned my hair and scalp with bleach three times and messed up my haircuts. The third time she burned my hair, it was so bad that I had sores and scabs on my scalp. No doubt it’s from my scalp being burned and then her scraping a comb across the burns while rinsing the beach out. I kid you not I had bleach on my head for almost an hour with her only checking on me twice before I finally had enough and said my head was really burning. Don’t ever go here. Don’t ever recommend them. Waste of money, time, and you will end up wishing you went somewhere else.</review>

Mindy is phenomenal! She cuts exactly which type of haircut I want and color every time. I trust her judgment with my type of hair as she provides honest details and needs for my hair.  If I show her a photo of what I want, she gives me her opinion based on the type of hair I have with the results. She takes care and knows how I want my hair. 100% satisfied and continued customer. Prices are always fair and never over priced.</text>

Best Barber is all of San Jose, if you want to go somewhere and get a standard men's haircut for cheap this is the place. Quick, easy, very nice and cheap, what more could you ask for.<//text>

The lady has no patience and she was being rude to me when I told to cut my hair not to short
The ambience is bad and I have got the worst hair cut ever ..
I could have given zero rating but unfortunately I have to give only 1.
None of them knows how to cut hair here< /Review>

First of all, I don’t know why there are so many bad reviews. I have been going to this place since I was in kindergarten. Now, I just graduated from high school and I’m still going to Mindy. Mindy is the best. My mom, my little sister and I all get the same short bob hair cut and she always does an amazing job. Even if I move to another state, we are still going to this place for a hair cut. I’m so proud hair. She doesn’t age. Good job Mindy! Love you. Mindy is like my sister. Now my mom has gotten older and she still comes here lol. Now my brother is Mindy’s new customer. I’ve recommended this place to everybody in my family. They all love Mindy. I don’t understand why there’s so much hate. She talks on the phone a lot but she gets the job done. Ok I’m done lol< /Review>

<Review>Please don't go to this place ever. She only cares about money and number of customer. In 3-4 mins, she will finish any type of hair cut and force you to leave as all done and good and charge 13 dollar. She doesn't know english, good behavior and obviously hair cut. If you want to make your look really bad, i would suggest you to visit.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< rating>

They dont have any experience of hair cutting. They cut my hair like my mom was doing when I was 3 year old.

Changed my hair style. Very bad experience.
Will never visit this salon again.</review>

My husband went there few times as there were no options. Worst ever hair cut I have seen. That Japanese lady charges 13 dollar for that bogus hair cut. She does hair cut for male in literally in 2 mins and she will force to leave after that and will say all good.< /text>

They messed up my hair so bad!!! I showed them a picture and I clearly told her how to do it but she didn’t even listen to me and she did how ever tf she wanted!!! Never ever go their! After she messed up my hair she started yelling at me when she was the one who messed up my hair! This unacceptable!!!  They don’t even deserve 1 star!< /Text>

An inexpensive haircut close to home - what more could I ask for? The haircut was typical for me - short and sticking up requiring me to use product until it grows out a bit. Difficult to beat the cost, though. And I haven't seen more expensive chains do better cuts.< /Text>

I don't know about the drinks, but the mango shaved ice from here was amazing. I especially loved the popping boba they put on it. The cleanliness isn't great though< /Text>

Great spot to get a refreshing drink when it's hot out. We usually order the slushie cause its dairy free. Our favorites are the mango and rose mango flavors so far. They have a functional bathroom despite the out of order sign. They have a rewards program but only count the tea drinks, it's okay since they still send you offers.</Review>

My daughter and I searched for a place to visit that look appealing on the net. We had one afternoon to explore San Fransisco. We made this choice from the selection and presentation FrosTea created. We learned that the owner is less a year into this business. Her  enthusiastic and energetic attitude prevailed and were consistent with generous portions and polite service. This establishment will succeed and grow quickly. I welcome getting to be a part of supporting its development.</text>

<text>I asked for a slightly sweet almond avocado green milk tea. It was actually far too sweet, so much so that I couldn't finish it. The almond flavour was so overpowering that I could taste neither the avocado nor the green tea. Serving is pretty generous though: medium here is the equivalent of what I'd tend to call large.</text>< pics>

My daughter and I enjoyed the Mango Rose slushie, motzerella sticks, gyoza, and rasberry macaron. The young lady working the counter was super hospitable and made us delicious treats. Enjoyed the comfy vibe!!<//Review>

Delicious bubble tea place. Came across this shop every time I get off the bus. Huge servings for a great price! I added a picture of the large bubble tea next to a 1 gallon water bottle. The first tea place that had three selections of sweetness. I took normal and it was personally a little too sweet for me. I choose half sweet and that's perfect.</Review>

The place itself was a really chill place. Perfect to hang with friends. I gave this place three stars because of the teas itself. I ordered a caramel milk tea with 100% sweetness, it was way too sweet. If you want a good boba spot, I suggest you look up somewhere else.<//review>

We tried the boba and it was pretty standard. The medium size was huge and well-priced. I had the green milk tea and it was good. My husband tried the Thai tea, which sadly isn't premixed so he found powder in his drink and had to shake it up himself.< /text>< Pics>

The drink was really good but I was a little bit disappointed in the popcorn chicken. The drink I got was really tasty but it had a lot of ice in it. I got the Mango/Passionfruit flavor black tea with lychee jelly and I must say it was a really good choice combo on my part! The only complaint I have is with the ice because not a lot of people like a lot of ice in their drinks. As for the popcorn chicken, it looked so good and ready to eat with the sauce I ordered to go along with it. After a several bites into the popcorn chicken, it just didn’t taste good anymore. It was slightly over cooked even with the right amount of seasoning and sauce. I highly recommend just a couple of test runs after closing to perfect the popcorn chicken. That’s about all I have to say in my review! A huge thanks to UberEats for delivery.< /text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Not premium teas and milks like Boba Guys, but it's a decent milk tea with huge serving sizes for a good price! I ordered the green milk tea with honey and lavendar flavor and added 1 topping, housemade grass jelly. Haven't tried their shaved snow or ice cream macarons yet because the macarons look a little stale in the freezer. Also it's usually too chilly and foggy in this area for frozen desserts!! But I saw that they have a stock of board games in the corner and a few tables for groups, so would love to come back to hang out.

TIP: Join the FiveStar app and sometimes they will send you a free drink! (No purchase necessary)</review>< pictures>

Ok I love this location. I have rented cars from them a few times and the process is always simple and the cars are reliable and clean. Once you are in their system, renting again is fast and seamless. Really nice staff that makes you feel appreciated for your business. Keep up the great work - I will definitely be back.</Review>

Good job fellas. Austin, was my rep again. They came and got me within 20mins of calling in. Call the actual store... Not the reservation system. The enterprise call center is awful. I call the store and set it up all thru the team members at the physical location. In Rocklin the are professional to a fault. Maybe I'm just not funny, it became sort of a sport for me to see if I could get one of them to break. Couldn't attain it. No matter what crazy words spewed forth from my mouth; all 4 reps I dealt with (mainly Austin), they remained straight laced nearing robotic like  professional. So this has become a mini-novela, apologies. YES, RENT a car here. They are really good. They need to call a spade a spade tho when upselling insurance offers. See yall next time. I got a Dodge Challenger then some Kia thing that had lane assist. Good time. Cars were dirty but fine other than that.< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>Worst ever. We had a planned trip to see our son and daughter-in-law in Oregon. Daughter-in-law due date for c-section in 4 days. Rental car they brought out was scratched everywhere, but the worst part was the back tires were bald. Front tires looked fine. I asked for a different vehicle and we were told there weren’t any. When called to rent a vehicle I requested a Tahoe or Suburban. They brought out a Nissan Armada, which would have been fine if the tires were not bald. Worst customer service. I have used this company before and this was the worst experience.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1609463573731, 'text': 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention, Julie.

<text>My husband and I were celebrating our 25th anniversary and had planned a getaway to Jenner, CA. We took our car in for service the day before we were going to leave to make sure everything was good to go. Unexpectedly, the car place needed to keep our car another few days. Not wanting to delay or reschedule our trip, I went online to see about a rental. We did not have a big budget so we were prepared for just a little car to get us where we needed to go. I reserved a car online at 5:30pm for pickup the next morning. Not only did they have a car ready, but they gave us a free upgrade! It was the best trip we have taken in a long time! Kendra was so kind and helpful! They are not pushy about the extra insurance or extras, they just explain clearly and then you decide. The cars are kept in such good condition and the whole process is quick so you are in your way in no time! We have rented from Enterprise before and they always give such great customer service, we will always go back to them!</text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>{'time': 1600885964352, 'text': 'Thank you again for taking the time to let us know how we did.

The car I was given, a Toyota Corolla, was very nice, clean,  and handled very well. It was ready when we went to pick it up and check-out was very easy. The car got excellent gas mileage. I would say we averaged about 35 miles a gallon .
The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is that when they gave us two keys, they were fastened together on a band that was crimped in metal , so they could not be separated. When I return the car, I brought this up to the young lady who checked me in , who basically and insistently  blew me off about the keys, and  told me I could have used a "bolt cutter"  (which I normally don't have with me on vacation). I also figured since the keys and the key holder were the property of Enterprise, I should not damage them. Enterprise could easily put the keys on a screw together key loop.<//Text>

< review>
I was really bummed today. We leave on our trip at 4am tomorrow and I had a reservation for a minivan about a month in advance. I changed it online to a suburban and the next day they called me to say they didn't actually have a Suburban but they managed to find a Tahoe. Fine, I go pick it up and  and the price is hundreds more than the Suburban (which is way bigger, so IDK how that happened). Then after the grand total comes up, they inform me that I can ONLY pay with a credit card. They would not allow me to put a credit card on file and pay with my debit up front. That's fine too, I guess that's store policy but maybe they should have said something before I wasted a whole hour there with my 10 month old. I went to Budget Car Rental and got the same freaking Tahoe for SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS LESS. Six. Hundred. And they checked me out in less than 10 minutes. Mind blown.< /review>

Worst service ever. They gave me a car with a soaking seat. They did not even try to help me. They told me to call other Enterprise and get another car. They did not want to call other places for me. What kind of customer service is that?< /text>

Exceptional service at this location on last rental there.  New staff is Great! They were fast and efficient in both picking me up and getting me on the road and the same on the return.  Also they made an extra effort to correct my mistake in return (i initially did not give them the my preferredt credit card so they changed it to the one i preferred)</Text>

This vehicle nicely accomodates two child care seats in the 2nd row bucket seats and the automatic sliding panel doors makes it easy to get the young kids in and out.   My last trip was just over 1000 miles, and the minivan was comfortable for all passengers.

I am not here to just give an emotional review because this is not the first time I've rented with this company. I just believe this office can be better. Terrible experience doing business with them. My case?
I made a reservation for a Full-size sedan only to get an intermediate car. When I kindly asked them to fix it I was told nothing can be done. Do I get a fair price change base on the type of car size? No! Rather I was adviced by them to cancel my reservation all the way. Not good.< /Review>

My car repair shop rented me a car here several months ago, while mine was being repaired. I secured the rental car with my bank card a the time, and discovered today that someone from this location used my bank card information to fraudulently make charges against my account. They first tried unsuccessfully to make a large withdrawal, and then successfully made a lower one. I have filed a report with my bank, and notified the branch of the incident. They do not secure their customer's financial and personal information against theft by their employees, and I would imagine that they likely do not protect it from outside sources as well. I will never trust them with my information again.< /text>

I rent a few times a year for both business and personal use.  I have always had prompt, courteous, professional service.  My last rental was unexpected due to a breakdown.  I was promptly picked up and given a car within 45 minutes.  This was important because I had my 8 year old awaiting my arrival.

So we rent a car from this location for 2 days. The entire time driving the car the transmission was not running right. We we afraid of getting stranded. The transmission when taking off, as I stepped on the gas to increase my speed  it wasnt really going anywhere. The RPM was at passed 3 or 4 rpm but the car would stay at 30mph. It was ok driving once it got up to 70mph. But at a stop and go or around town. It was struggling to shift gears. They said oh we tested it but it was fine, of course your going to say that its your cars. They also said its a Toyota their know to do that. Well for your information I have a Toyota Camry and  my car does NOT do that. I know the difference, I'm not stupid. They even didn't even give me a car I wanted, that Toyota Corolla wa all they had unless I wanted a bigger vehicle. My suggestion is to go to a bigger Enterprise were you have more selection. So your not stuck with one of theirs that's always being driven and don't run right. THEY EVEN DIDN'T"T TRY TO MAKE IT RIGHT. 5% of your next rental WOW really- not with you guys.

If you want great reliable customer service without a long wait I would go somewhere else!

I'm not completely unsatisfied but not satisfied with my rental experience at this location. The first time I rented here I had some issues that  were completely taken care of with great customer service! This last time I rented for me is not the same out come. I showed up 15 minutes early only to see the manager drive off in my rental car to take her daughter to school. The gal at the front counter, who was nice and well dressed, rushed through my paper work and told me they had no other cars and I had to wait. When the manager came back with my car the gal had to wait to get the keys from her and then I was told the car was empty and I either had to go get gas or wait while they got gas. At this time I point out that this is unacceptable not only because I've been waiting but that this is now my time that I'm paying for the car and it should be ready. The manager lied to me and tells me the car just came in this morning and they hadn't had time to get fuel. When I pointed out that I saw her taking her daughter to school in it and that she should have gotten fuel on the way back she got a rude sassy attitude. She stated that I should be happy because I got an upgrade to a" higher end car" already. Then She tried to give me multiple lower grade cars than what I rented after I was told that was the only car available. Finely she gave me an up grade to a suv that had fuel and gave me half the fuel tank for free only after I pointed out fuel economy is different from the type of car I rented which is why I'm renting. Another associate, who was new, was sent out with me when I found out that the insurance I asked for had not been applied when I first got the paper work. He apologized profusely as he got me out as fast as he could because I had been there for 45 minutes already and the only customer there.

On my return I had to wait, along with other customers, for 10 minutes in an empty office before we asked next door when we would be helped. The manager who was so rude in the beginning helped me check out. At this time I found out that I got every insurance there was which was not what I asked for. The manager was extremely nice this time and fixed the mistake of the insurance. Then as I was leaving she said I would get a survey and made it very clear that I needed to be "completely satisfied" because that's her only "passing grade". Which made it clear to me why she asked the entire time of checking out if I was "completely satisfied" with my rental experience.

The vehicle I was upgraded to was very nice. I wouldn't mind renting it again. Unfortunately it doesn't make up for the lack of organization and sassy attitude of the manager.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Absolutely the best experience I have ever had renting a car.  I had reserved a mini-van for a family vacation.  I was called the day before to let me know that a van "might" not be available at the time I had requested since the manager had noticed late drop-offs lately (How is that for quality care?!)  Asked if I would be ok with a SUV upgrade which I was.  When I got there, a van was available but was offered the SUV at no additional charge which I took.  I was driving out in less than 10 minutes!  Drop-off was just as easy.  Will return and highly recommend!</Review>< pics>

Katie Harlan, Rocklin Branch Manager on Pacific Street, and her team, Mitch in particular, gave me a excellent rental experience.  The GMC Yukon was perfect for the trip I had planned that included two people over the age of 84 years.  The vehicle was clean and comfortable.
I prefer to make my reservations in person when I need a vehicle other than a standard car, this office is excellent in getting the right vehicle for my needs.
Wait time for the return was minimal and the driver who took me home was friendly.
Thank you Katie and Team.</Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><Text>The Rocklin office and the salesman , Ivan,was efficient and professional. I got an upgrade and loved the Nissan Sentra. I was told that my 250 refund would be credited to my card when I returned the car in San Francisco. That did not happen. I was told that Rocklin was responsible for that. This was a disappointment to me.The salesman, James, at the SF. airport  gave me a discount for a future rental because of the misunderstanding.
The refund needs to be clarified as to when it is issued. The toll for the Golden Gate Bridge is totally confusing. The car rental needs to explain that they pay it as a picture is taken at the bridge  of the rental car license plate.Actually, there should be a sign at the bridge that the license plate holder is billed.
Any one not from the area doesn’t know how or when to pay.
Happy New Year to all,

Very friendly staff. Great price. Gave me choices for vehicles and didn’t receive any pressure/sales talk. Donald was great!
Why 4 stars? The right wiper on my car was not working and air pressure were not checked (low air on right rear tire according to rental car’s own onboard diagnostics) and... car smelled like cigarettes. Febreeze!</Text>

Enterprise varies store to store.
This particular store has professional staff.
Don't expect that at other enterprises, it just isn't that way-.

The enterprise in Citrus Heights is horrible, and has predatory practices.
Be aware enterprise will charge your credit card without authorization, before you return your vehicle, and more than you owe.<//Review>

It's co-located with an auto body shop, which is great for getting a rental that's covered by your insurance. The people are polite and try to help you out. The location is inconvenient and hard to get in/out of, and it has a cramped parking lot.  Their car selection is also lacking.</review>

The two woman at the front desk were extremely rude. I'm not sure what I did to to be treated in such a terrible way. They originally told me it would be a 10 min wait, 45 min later I'm still waiting. When I asked the front desk woman how much longer it would be, she said "he's coming" and walked away. Then the two continued to text and talk rudely about other employees. I will not be coming back here</text>

One of their employees backed into my car said "sorry" and gave me their information and assured me they would take care of the damages and then lied to the insurance company and now they are saying I am at fault. Rude crooks! Liars! I have never met people this dishonest. Blatantly lied on tape to save themselves money. Call Curtis here I come. Now I have to get an attorney and waist my time on a slam dunk case. What a waiste of time and money. There were customers in there being disrespected for not speaking good english while I waited for there info. Go anywhere else!< /text>

< review>
The customer service at this particular location is horrible. They don't care about the customer or there needs. Very rude and short during conversation. Will not be going back.< /review>

<review>I had been coming here for years, it had been really good. Food is great.
Today, however..... Service was ridiculous. Waited an hour and twenty minutes, all because people "ordered over the phone". One could really tell all these people that kept coming after me, were the waitresses friends and thats why they were being treated different.
Doubt I'll ever come back. I didn't even eat my food because i was upset.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80c29767f7639bbb:0xc2f25e4eb8ea62fe</Gmap_id><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

Great food.  It is best to order ahead because they usually have lots of order to go.  I love the pupusas and corn tamales. The pan con pollo is excellent.< /Text>

First of all. Good looking place if you are looking to stay there more than an hour with fam and friends. Parking is a problem sometimes. Not necessarily the restaurant problem. Pupusas are just right give it a 10/10. Salsa (spicy) 10/10 Curtido (spicy) 9/10 Horchata de morro 6/10. Thats the good things I can talk about this place. Now on the second hand... It is pricy. You can only use your debid card if you are spending more than $15 that you will if you are looking for a hole meal for yourself. The worst thing is having to wait for your food. I would like to recomend the owner of the place to hire more employees because that is an issue.< /Text>

Everyone was extremely professional and helpful. Whenever I had a question they would help me as best I can, or point me to someone else who could give me a better answer. It didn't matter if I was buying a rifle, ammo, or an accessory, they treated my business equally important. Also, their custom kydex holsters are worth the price, and had a very quick turn around time.< /Text>

Short answer - if I could give them zero or negative stars I would... Long answer - see below...

Over 5 years ago a few family members and myself purchased a combined total of about 6 AR lowers and some other AR parts from solar tactical, the staff was helpful and accommodating. I recently have been in the market to buy a handful of new firearms and have some work done to my existing firearms, I wanted to go through Solar Tactical because I had such a positive experience the first time.

The 2nd and 3rd experiences were so terrible compared to that first time, I have tried to give Solar Tactical a chance to rectify these bad experiences - but unfortunately they seem to not care about giving me a good customer service experience. I own my own company and I know that more often than not a bad customer service experience can be turned into a positive experience if the necessary respect, customer care, and time are given... Solar Tactical was disrespectful throughout this whole experience over the past 2 months.

I went through the process to purchase a new handgun in July of 2020, the first thing that I find unacceptable was that they are not answering their phone and are not letting the customers know this... the only way I could get a hold of them was through Instagram messages, and even this form of communication was not consistent. I made an unnecessary trip from the east bay to Livermore because they were not answering their phone or communicating... this was because I purchased the firearm and waited the 10 day waiting period then called and messaged to make an appointment to come pick up the firearm... no one got back to me and when I got to the store I found out that the 10 day waiting period is more like a 15 or 20 day waiting period because of Covid... but no one told me this, so I wasted an afternoon.in traffic.

When I finally did get a call to come pick up this firearm it was supplied with a trigger lock and the employee told me to follow the law I should put the trigger lock on the gun for transportation... the firearm frame was aluminum with Cerakote paint... the supplied trigger lock ended up scratching the finish on my brand new gun before I was even able to get it home, and when I called about this rather than having someone offer help or a solution I was told how it was my fault...

The final issue I had was from some work I had done on one of my existing firearms. I had a Cerakote paint  job done to the slide of my glock 34... I had some minor pitting on my 8 year old glock 34 so I brought my wife with me and had her help me choose a new color for my gun. The staff was helpful in including her in the process and bringing her behind the counter to look at the paint jobs they had on their EDC pistols as well as reviewing options on the computer they had behind the counter. My wife chose a very specific color and even pointed it out on a paint chip, it was a very dark purple like grape or grimace. Not only was I told it would be 2 weeks and ended up being almost 2 months... which is fine, but I would have liked to have been notified, but the gun came back LAVENDER and again I was told how this was my fault because the colors can look different than what is on the computer... then why would you show me a paint chip... since this work has been done no one would answer my call or respond to messages.

Unacceptable guys, so as you choose a gun store to support in these trying times and climate of gun ownership in California... CHOOSE ANYONE BUT SOLOAR TACTICAL, I would even be happy to help you find an alternative gun store.< /Text>

Went in to see what inventory they had after searching everywhere in the Valley and not finding anything. I dealt with Pedro he was able to help me find what I needed. He was knowledgeable, honest and had amazing customer service. Only small complaint is cost but obviously supply and demand and with everyone buying up everything I am ecstatic to have been able to get anything at all! Thanks for your help Pedro<//Text>

<Text>We vame in for a PPT right after they opened. We were told that there were 2 customers before us before we would be helped. 1 hour later the employee helped those two customers and numerous other who came in after us. We understand they were short staffed but we were told one thing and obviously treated differently. I would not recommend coming here for any PPT services. We currently have been waiting over 1 hour for a service that only takes 20-30mins maximum. Good selection but I definitely will not be returning to purchase anything.< /Text>< time>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>I came here just under a year ago. First, the staff is extremely knowledgeable AND experienced. Second, they are nice people, they'll show you the cool new stuff, let you hold all the guns, etc., but they're straight up with you. That is extremely important in my opinion. This isn't anything like the stupid gun shop that sold my 65 year old, first-time-shooter mother, a .357 magnum for home defense. They also won't try to sell your wife the pink gun just because it's pink. Solar Tactical knows their industry. Third, the prices are on point; they even offer some great deals/discounts now and then on certain products. I was originally recommended to Solar Tactical from a friend, and I have been recommending them to others ever since. Keep up the great work.</review>< Rating>

All the guys at the shop are great and always willing to help
Can’t understand why some people didn’t give 5 stars
I guess some people get but hurt when they get charged for a canceled order. That’s what happens when you order something and you flake. As far as going someplace else that’s not for me. Mike the owner treats me right and I enjoy hanging out and talking with the guys. I’m sure you can find products cheaper but my time is valuable to me and I’m not gonna drive all over the place and make calls just to save a few bucks. The customer service is awesome. Especially when you buy a gun from them and you may want to have a part put on, they don’t charge you. ( UNLESS YOUR A REAL PRICK. )< /Text>< pictures>

Ass. Holes. Can I say that? Oh well.

I really wanted to make a certain purchase, and I also wanted to keep my business local--as I usually try to if I can. So I talked to the rectal specialists over here at Sucky Tactical and told them the make and model of what I was looking for. Well, they were selling it (a handgun) for $200 more than Tracy Rifle and Pistol. I even offered to split the difference with them, and they told me to... well I definitely can't say that on a Google review. Needless to say, they lost my business forever, and several of my friends' business too. There's literally no reason they had to be like that. I'll be shopping at Tracy Rifle and Pistol.</review>

<text>Bought many of my AR parts from Solar Tactical and have always had a great experience!

Yesterday went in for some primers to start my reloading again and started asking questions about setting up my dies.  The owner of the store invited me in the back to take a look at how their press was set up.  Even gave me a few bullets to test out on my press.  That's what I call personal customer service!

Can't wait to purchase my TRP from them soon!< /text><pictures>None</pictures></record></dataset><record>

There aren't many places you can go to to get the wealth of information that solar tactical has. They take their time and make sure you can make an educated decision about your purchase. With service like that they should be around for years to come.</Text>

<Text>Don't do business with these guys. I placed a order Oct 15 and it said the items were 3 to 4 weeks out from shipping, so on Oct 19 I called to cancel the order, and they charged me a 25% restocking fee on a order that not only has not shipped, but wasn't even manufactured yet. I will never do business with them again, and have advised all my employees to stay away from this company for bad business practices.</Text>< Time>

I asked for a Geisselle Nat Match trigger. He talked me into an SSA-E.  Then he rang up an SSA.  I complained 3X.  He said it was better.  I looked it up later and everything he said was wrong. When I returned it next day, they charged 25%.  So, fake knowledge, bait n switch, lied, then gouged a fee.<//Text>

Worst customer service ever. It really deserves 0 stars.  When I walked in there were 4 or 5 good ol' boy's talking behind the counter so I assumed they all worked there. There was a man and a woman together and one of the good ol' boy's was helping them with an AR. They were the only other customers in the store beside me.  One of the good ol' boys some bearded douche bag walks over to me and asked me if he could help me. I wanted a hard to find caliber of ammo so I asked if they had any.
Douche bag checks his computer which was right in front of me and starts muttering under his breath. He then turns to the good ol' boy who was helping the man an woman with the AR. He starts talking to them and just left me hanging, then he storms off to the back of the store with the couples AR. He didn't even tell me if they had the ammo I wanted. So I left.
Those guys are all Douche bags and I will never ever go back to the good ol boy's place again. I wouldn't recommend them if they were the last gun shop on earth.
I've been around guns and gun stores for over 30 years and this was the worst customer service EVER! I wouldn't spend a penny in that Piece of S**t  store and to all who read this don't waste your time going there. If you want a good gun shop go to Tracy Rifle and Pistol or Elite Arms in Manteca. They are great and know how to treat customers.< /review>

Good inventory of major guns: handguns, revolvers, AR-15 s, AK, ...
However, it is often crowded so you have to take a number to be served.< /text>

I was two steps in the door when a stern looking employee immediately asked "how old are you" in a gruff tone.  (I'm 21)  No "how can I help you?"  or "hi, what are you looking for?".  When I told the salesperson my age and what I was looking for, he then went and found something similar with a very annoyed attitude, like I wasn't worth his time.

I have taken my business to Tracy Rifle and Pistol, and haven't gone back.<//text>

This church makes you search deeper in the word of God in a very loving way. Pastor Phillip is so great to stick to the principles and his native Irish accent makes even more real.<//text>

Thankful to be a part of a healthy church that faithfully communicates the Word of God in all of the arenas of teaching. Whether it be from the pulpit or by the Kindred University classes, the Spiritual Leadership program or the multiple other ministries within Kindred that exalt The Lord, equip the saints for ministry and edify each other in Truth.

In addition the specific ministries within Kindred are like no other that I have seen in the Country. A high degree of excellence for the glory of God as people (and families)  are ministered to and grow.< /text>

Amazing church. Amazing staff. Amazing people. They do an excellent job at greeting new visitors. They do a great job teaching the Bible in a way that is easy to understand. They have great children's ministry with security for all the growing families. This church has something for everyone and sound doctrine.< /Review>

So blessed to have been at this church for 10 years now. Faithful preaching, friendly people, and a feeling that you are loved and cared for every time you walk on campus. God is good and I am so thankful to have found this church.</Text>

We drive from Lakewood every Sunday and we are truly blessed to have found Kindred. The teaching is verse by verse in an expository manner which we love. On the pulpit is inscribed "Rules Unchanged, Preach the Word". You will be introduced to, who we believe is, one of our nations great Bible expositors in Philip De Courcy. As you come up the hill, be sure to stop and tell them this is your first time so you get VIP parking! Warning-Once you come, you may not want to leave! God Bless!<//Review>

We have learned and grown so much in the 3 years we've been going there. I have personally found it to be a safe haven for those who have been wounded by other churches. The people are warm and inviting, the preaching is bold, convicting without condemning, and biblically sound, and the quality of their adult Sunday school classes (Kindred University) is akin to first year at seminary. They have excellent children's programs that will truly teach your children the gospel, not just keep them entertained with busy work. They have an ASL interpreter for the Deaf during second service, and there is a growing ministry serving special needs children and adults. They offer an entire library of free resources on CD...I just can't say enough good about it.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

The most phenomenal church I've been to. Bible-based, expository preaching - I feel as though I'm a new Christian, as the teaching and preaching is wonderful and deep! So friendly - just amazing and we drive as a family 30 minutes and it is so worth the drive!</review>

Diana and her crew are EXCEPTIONAL, WONDERFUL, CARING, and most importantly,  LOVING, caretakers of our pups. Aside from our regular visits, for a few years now, we had to leave town and weren't able to take our little ones. We called Diana to see if she could watch them for a couple of nights. She didn't bat an eye before saying yes. Her prices are very reasonable. We are never unhappy with the care in which they are groomed. I could go on, but this would be a mini novel. From the bottom of our hearts,  THANK YOU FANCY PAWS CREW. ❤</Text>

I took two of my yorkies that were 6 months old at the time, and their haircut made them look like they were old dogs...They did a terrible job on my puppies. I asked them for a teddy bear cut, and they gave my puppies an old man haircut with a mustache...I was not satisfied...< /Text>

<Review>Moved to Bakersfield a year ago, finally found a Grooming salon that groomed my dog beautifully and bathed her!  She smells so clean. Very happy with their service, they did everything we asked for.
Receptionist was very nice, price was very reasonable. We will continue to go there.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Great service! Great groomers! Great prices! I'm extremely picky about who grooms my AKC Chow Chows, my groomer of 7 years moved to Washington. So when I found Stars Fancy Paws I read the reviews which were all great and positive. Went in met with the staff before my grooming appointment explained exactly what I wanted as far as grooming my Chows. They assured me my dogs would be in great hands and I must say they made me feel at ease. Took my Chow in and when I picked her up I was amazed at how awesome she looked! Perfect! They did a great job! I have finally found another grooming salon to replace my groomer who moved! Thank you all for your professionalism and great care you showed my Chow "Bindi"</text>

This place is amazing. I have a Boxer-Pit Bull mix that is an absolute handful (in addition to a Beagle and Chihuahua)! They are the only groomer that can trim my big boy's nails! You won't find a nicer staff nor better prices anywhere! We are a lifetime client of Stars!</Text>

My experience has always been positive.  My dogs are part of our family so I pay close attention to how they are handled.  They are all rescues, I have had up to 6, all with their own special issues.  Diane and her husband have always known how to handle them in a very caring and loving way which is very important to me.  The place is super clean and improvements always happening. The dogs that go their are treated with love and care.  Diane and Moses lways willing to work with the customer.
I feel at peace when I leave my furry children there for their grooming.<//review>

I have an Alaskan Malamute, and we have been going there for years, no one can top their service. Our dog "Kirah'' doesn't like to get groomed often and her being difficult 125 lbs is very challenging, but they handle her perfectly and now she loves going there. We Also just recently got a husky and they took the most beautiful photographs of him.<//text>

I'm a first timer going to this establishment! I took my bruno (senior pitbull) in to have his nails cut. They handled him with so much love and compassion. I've taken bruno to other spots but they frown upon his breed. Bruno's big and anxious with his nails but they did a great job. I'm forever coming here. My dog's are my kids so if their happy... I'm happy. Please give them a try!

Great place to get your dog groomed. I took my poodle charley there and he came out looking handsome. I have been going here for awhile now and let me tell you that it is the best place to get your dog looking amazing.< /text>

The best dog groomer in town. We've been taking our dog there for 3 years now for grooming and boarding with no complaints. Even dogs with special needs or an attitude like ours are treated with care. I can't imagine going anywhere else. Always recommending Dianna and her fantastic professional staff to all of our friends....<//review>

< Review>
Stars Fancy Paws has been such a great groomer for my dog. They are very kind and reliable and always manage to find time for walk ins even on busy days. My dog is often not cooperative when being groomed and is usually frightened and fidgeting, but they always manage to get him a great groom despite this. They are very loving with animals, and I would recommend them 100%.</Review>

The owner along with her staff are so nice and inform you immediately of any accidents (if any occurred) and health issues they discovered with your pet. Not to mention I feel at ease to leave my dog there and not worried if they are being treated poorly. Love this place, but I wish the location wasn't too far.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Willie is a dog that does not socialize well at all with people or dogs...and after going consistently to get groomed and also boarding there he actually likes to go now...he runs into the office then into the inner gate where the other animals are...his last name now includes the owners with ours 😁
He always looks great...and sports a nice bandana when he comes home smelling fresh and clean and looking quite handsome...I would recommend Stars Fancy Paws to anyone who wants their dogs treated with care and love...<//text>

While accidents do unfortunately happen at times, this is extremely rare for us and while we understand if you choose not to return, we hope you know that we care for every animal as though it was our own, and we felt terrible that this happened. While we know this doesn't entirely make up for this unfortunate accident, we would like to point out that Stars Fancy Paws fully covered the cost of the surgery, because we believe in doing anything we can to correct our mistakes.

<Review>(Translated by Google) I like the work they have done with my two cats, when I have taken them for baths and haircuts. And they got me out of big trouble when we bought a puppy that was infested with ticks ... thanks

<Text>Generous portions and reasonable prices, quite spicy but that was probably the best part of it.   Very cute location I would guess it was fun to actually dine in there but alas that isn't the case today.  The interaction with the person who took my order and pickup was also good.

Ordered the pineapple fried rice with shrimp, and spicy noodle with pork.
I didn't like either dish, each dish was a single shade of unappetizing brown, lots of heat, and a varying degree of fish sauce.   I can and have made better Thai food at home so its not likely i would return again soon.  I would have given 2 stars if this were solely my own opinion, so you might like it even though I didn't.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Text>This place is so freaking good.  We ordered pad thai (huuuuuge portion), massaman curry with chicken, cream cheese wontons and angel wings.  Pad thai is so saucy which is so good, other places give you dry noodles and it drives me bonkers.  Chicken in curry was cooked perfectly.  Angel wings were very tasty and different from what we typically order. We’re very happy we ordered from here.  Thai iced tea is not very sweet which I appreciate.  Can’t wait to dine-in once Covid is gone!< /Text>< Pics>

I was searching for Thai in north park and I’m glad I chose to go here. I ordered the Jungle Curry.. it seriously blew my mind. It was seasoned so beautifully and is maybe one the best Thai curry’s i’ve ever had. It’s the kind of delicious where you wanna smash the entire thing in one go. I can’t even imagine how good their other curries must be. I’m looking forward to trying more things on their menu. Portion size was excellent as well. 10/10 would recommend.< /review>

<review>All the usual Thai dishes, plus some interesting originals. Scallops are an option. The tom yum soup is outstanding, and the jungle curry is great. Service is a little slow at peak hours, and there's only one single-occupancy restroom.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOH2GnyGigDVfT0PXShEq9afOlejfRY3JzZ7Vp6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6MQrSe_yawfRZG2o0daEIjMOZxTX5_cDe8dKr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Poondee the waitress is the best she so personable and fun remembers your name and what you like.  She also is knowledgeable and gives good recommendations to try some other delicious stuff on the menu.  The setting is a cute  little craftsman home that is decorated well.  I like the owners style very artistic.  My favorite Thai restaurant and it’s close.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Weekends can be busy with orders prepare to order early.  They can tell you its 40 minute wait for food but its really an hour.  That day I was not thrilled with the service.  But the food is what I am really going there for so I deal with it.  Panang curry and, Pad See Eew is my go too meals.  Tomkah, egg rolls and Tomyum is great starters.< /Review>

We are their regular customers. All the time visiting this place because they serve very delicious thai foods. All of the food fresh and well seasoned. Only the problem is parking. Their parking all the time full and we are looking 15-20 min to find a parking. But the food and service are great!<//Text>

This is our absolute favorite Thai spot!!!
The food is amazing along with the staff. The lunch size and price is great as well or if your really hungry get the entree portion. Not much parking but I’d walked blocks to get there if needed!< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>My favorite Thai place in San Diego.  They used to have two locations, and this one was a new place from those others.

Don't let that, or the terrible spot and parking sway you, it's worth it, at least to me.

They should definitely get better signage, though.  I've been there multiple times and I still have a hard time finding it at night.< /Text>< Pictures>

last night was the first time in this good restaurant. But It is surely not the last. We enjoyed the evening very much with the excellent service, with the exceptional cooking and fine drinks and with the modest price. We will definitely return there in a short time.<//text>

<Review>Delicious food and very sweet, friendly people. Had to pop in for a quick, early dinner with my 8 year old. We really liked it. She had Pad See Ew, the perfect Thai kid's meal. I had sweet basil. Nothing fancy, but good stuff.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Love this local place that offers good Thai food. You're able to pick your spice level (1 - 10, with 10 being the spiciest), which is a great option to stay neutral or sweat it out. Just be careful not to get an already spicy dish marked with a pepper & think you're okay getting the same level of spice you did last time without the pepper marking... You may not enjoy the dish as much. The staff is super friendly but they may not always see you if you're in one of the corner tables and you're in a rush to leave...you may need to flag them down. Food is quick, delicious, and filling. You won't be disappointed!

Tip: better to be mild and then be able to increase the heat level if you need more .</Text><user_id>101023979759551678024<//user_id><Rate>4</Rate>< time>

In addition, to a clean, friendly and stylish environment, the food is AMAZING!!! The spicy level was on point with what we asked for. First time trying jungle curry and it was delicious! Their spicy fried rice was really good as well! Highly recommend :)< /text>

Favorite Thai food restaurant in San Diego, they also make the best Thai tea I've had. The portions are generous and the prices are great. The food is really tasty, fresh and made with good quality ingredients. The place is pretty and cozy inside, and the service is good. I love the Lad Na Noodles and Choo-Chi duck.<//Review>

We ordered Fried rice with chicken and Tom Yum soup with shrimp for to go.
Fried rice is well portion and taste alright. Tom Yum soup is come with can mushrooms and small  frozen shrimps. We gave 2 🌟 for the soup.

Eat at the restaurant, they have parking in front of the building for free.
The restaurant is really nice and clean.
We ordered Papaya salad, Spicy seafood salad and Thai princess for appetizers. We tried Catfish with spicy curry , it come with rice and pretty tasty.< /Text>

Bangkok Spices Thai restaurant is a new restaurant in North Park on 30th. It is in a quaint renovated Craftsman home so it has a wonderful Vibe when you step inside. The food is extremely fresh and well prepared. You can choose your degree of heat. The meals come out very quickly and are wonderful, tasty, and just a pleasure to eat. We will definitely make this one of our regular places.<//Text>

<Review>Hands down the best Thai food in San Diego! Bangkok Spices is just off the beaten path and offers a cozy atmosphere with amazing food for the family. The staff and owners are super friendly and always greet you with a smile. Try their spin on Drunken Noodles and you can't go wrong. I can recommend this place enough.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<rate>3< /rate><text>Set  in a remodeled little cottage house, the interior of this restaurant is quite nice, it’s not what you would expect from the outside. There’s three parking spaces in front, although one is handicapped. There’s about a dozen tables, staff is nice.

The menu is not too large, but has the basic Thai items. It’s not too expensive, but just about average. I got the drunken noodles with tofu, it’s a fairly large portion, a lot of noodles on a bed on lettuce, with bell peppers, green onion, and egg. Flavor was just okay, there was garlic and oil, but needed a bit more soy sauce.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

I used to love this place but with the new location the food seems to be of lower quality. I would always get the spicy noodles there but at the new location it was made quite different and not nearly as good. Not much flavor. We shared the chicken satay which was not imoressive either. The soup my friend got was very good though.</Review>

I finally found the place where Pad Thai doesn't have ketchup infused in it!!! Convoy St can be abused by a few mediocre places as a business gimmick. Thai Fried Rice was also very delicious. Beef was bit tough. Overall very good. Medium or 5 will give you sufficient amount of spiciness. The restaurant needs to update its address on Uber though.< /Text>

<Review>Yummy, reasonable amount of food, food arrived quickly, waitresses are fast and responsive. The one star off was because the pieces of duck meat in my pad thai were still linked together as large chunks.<//Review><userid>113906215038578569620<//userid><gmap_id>0x80d954f4e4a28e23:0xfc47cafe98f43a1< /gmap_id>< username>

We love this place we were devastated when it closed on El Cajon and then it popped up on our corner in North Park and we almost cried tears of joy! We've eaten a lot of Thai and this place is one of the best! The curry's and the pad Thai can't be beat!!! I give it 5 stars all day long!</review>

<Review>Pad thai at the new location is still on point and bonus points for having parking spots (though it's only 2) in crazy North Park! The restaurant was relatively empty when I went but I suspect that it's only because people aren't aware of their new location.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
I came in about 30 minutes before closing and did not see any staff around for a while. Eventually they appeared but told me they were closing and I couldn't order--unless I took takeout. Given that I had walked over a mile to get there, this wasn't ideal, but I saw good reviews here and didn't want to decide on something else after coming this far. After getting home, I wasn't particularly impressed with the quality; a 6/10 spiciness was about what you'd expect, but not much flavor to augment it.<//Review>

<review>Dandelion makes excellent quality craft chocolate. Talking to the workers, they are very hard working, knowledgeable, and happy to give any information about their variety of products. I understand they're working to unionize and am very happy to hear this, I will be back many times IF they succeed in unionizing!</review>< Pics>

We (I'm and my gf) love this place absolutely. If she wants true chocolate as a hot one she always ask me to take here there. Doesn't matter that is 30 minutes driving for me I always do that because I'm coffee lover and they have a strong espresso for me too..</Review>

<Text>The customer service for Dandelion Chocolate is tops.  I purchased a truffle box for delivery as a Christmas present, and when it was lost during shipment their support team was prompt, responsive and took great measures to ensure the issue was properly resolved and we were happy.

<review>The Canelles are perfection.  I am not as high on some of the other baked choices as I think they are too bitter, but it is likely my chocolate palette is not as developed as the chef talent in the kitchen.  I think ordering on the website should be more user friendly to get to and order, but overall, love Dandelion Chocolates!< /review>< Pictures>

They have a BROWNIE FLIGHT! Plus free little chocolate samples for tasting, and incredible cookies that might be better than the brownies. But the brownie flight is so creative. If it was served with ice cream I’d be back every day!</text>

Free chocolate samples! It's also a fun place to learn about how chocolate is made. I really enjoyed my European sipping chocolate and the little biscuit/cookie they included with our drink. The chocolate had depth of flavor that I don't always taste at other places.<//review>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Popular place with the neighborhood locals for desserts made with in house chocolate. My friends and I went on a Saturday night after 10pm... There was line and a little bit of a wait to order. Pastries are good, but I wish they were warmed up. I got the coffee cake. My friends got the smores & chocolate chip cookie. Again, wish they were served warm. We also go a double espresso and they are string. Served with sparkling water and a little chocolate nibble which was a nice pallet cleanser. Seating is very limited.< /text>< pictures>

<review>I love that you can see the chocolate process in the back! They’ve got lots of different types of chocolate from all over, and samples out front (all the way up to 100% cacao bars!). Off their menu, my absolute favorite is the frozen hot chocolate. I don’t care how cold it gets, I will always drink that when I’m here. The s’more is also a really nice pick-me-up. They torch the marshmallow right before serving, and the portion size is just right!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>If you enjoy chocolate then you definitely need to check this place out. There are free samples throughout the store with very clear descriptions highlighting the chocolate notes of each bar. They have creative chocolate and coffee drinks. Their chocolate processing machines are on full display and it appears they are continually processing chocolate as you see it pouring out of machines. They even offer tours of their shop to show you how they create their batches. They have a bowl of house made marshmallows you can add to your hot chocolate. Delicious! Lastly, just watch out because the line can build up quickly.< /Review>< Pics>

Great place for a cup of hot chocolate with a simply menu.

Ordered the Mission hot chocolate which was spiced and a European Drinking Chocolate.

The Mission Hot Chocolate has a really spicy kick and it isn’t too over powering. Has hints of cinnamon and probably ginger. Great when you are feeling cold.

The European Drinking Chocolate comes really thick and can be a drink to consider if you are sharing it with someone else. Really fantastic!!!< /Text>

Pretty good chocolate but not mind blowing. Prices are pretty steep. Their chocolate chip cookie was decent but not amazing. Same goes for the brownies. Overall it's a nice store with good decor and layout but I wouldn't go back because the desserts were average.<//Review>

Despite being a casting call of mission techies and pasty hipster hopefuls from the midwest, this is a fantastic place to get a treat or take a date. Amazing high chocolate drinks and treats are all on offer.  Things are priced at obscenely decadent prices reminiscent of the delights you are feasting on.</text>

Look, it's expensive, yes. But, it's SUPER high quality chocolate (including the closest thing to legit European drinking chocolate I've found in the area), and tastes great, so it's worth it for a treat. Good selection of chocolate, or just coffee, drinks, and small pastries as well.<//text>

Bean to bar/drink chocolate shop. Super fun to watch the process, see the care put into the selection and processing of the beans, and yummy results. Great vegan hot chocolate is including "Mexican" style and "European" style. Yummy bars. No vegan desserts :-(< /review>

So decadent and not too sweet. Def try the chocolate flight. Pricey for small pieces but the experience of trying a bit of everything is worth it. Their drinks are super good too. Plenty of seating places as well.</Review>

The best hot chocolate I've tasted in years. Thick, creamy, bitter and delicious.  Tiramisu is delicious as well. Worth the effort coming here. Definitely recommended a place to visit while in San Francisco.<//Review>

<userid>110044408245887412132<//userid><text>My obsession with bean to bar chocolate forces me to periodically go to Dandelion Chocolate to try their new bars or pastries. Their Anamalai bar is one of my recent favorite finds. Their European drinking chocolate is indulgent, without being excessively sweet. Although their pastries are a hit or miss, the citrus tart and s'mores are wonderful. I tremendously admire their business model and ethos to focus on fair trade sourcing.<//text>< rating>

I was so tempted by all their creations, so naturally I had to do the Chef's chocolate tasting flight. At $14, it's not cheap for the small portion sizes that you get, but I thought I got good value out of it

Items in the tasting:
- A spritzer made using chocolate from Belize (wasn't heavily chocolately, more like a light chocolate palate cleanser)
- Profiteroles using chocolate from Liberia (it was really good)
- S'more using chocolate from Ecuador (Absolutely divine! My fav!)
- Passionfruit chocolate macaron using chocolate from Madagascar (this was ok)
- Panna Cotta with chocolate from Venezuela (so good! My second fav!)

Now that I have had the tasting, my next visit will be focusing on getting the items that I like, as the regular items are bigger in size. Overall, I think this is as good as it gets for a small local chocolate factory/cafe!! A++

<Review>Completely changed the way I think about chocolate.

Love that they have samples sourced from different parts of the world.

By the way, tours have to be booked online weeks to months in advance, so don't go in looking for one.

Their take on the millionair's shortbread is absolutely delicious.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9ZqfHxEZqNWGp6a2ZZGJz6kWeB_W4DazLf_5V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwmHovx67VqsdIBD-ug-HruBx8UEyi9j0KMeN2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNQy2yCEwaJeTOaroDCrIS3XCqGnAl0OB6bBWF1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNgG8rcahTZ06Ii9YPUPp6z8eNEpMocVxn5dAvW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

I like the chocolates, but the service workers aren't friendly.  Hello!  Do they want tips for doing what they're already paid to do for take away orders!?  I am not impressed with snooty counter help!  If they want me to part with my hard earned $ then they need to treat me extra special.  Their attitude makes me rarely enter that specialty shop = the owners lose business from me & my friends due to their workers' presentation at the counter.<//Text>

<review>This review is an interview:
What did you like about it?
The best marshmallows I've ever had in my life. I felt good about the ethics. Supporting small global cocoa growers. Good place to have some fun and learn about chocolate. Free tasting helps it feel like a community experience, and the mission hot chocolate was excellent. Spice+cocoa was just perfect.

What can't you miss at this place?
The truffles are the best gift I've ever gotten. Don't miss on the chance to share something unique

What should people know?
They have nice seating, restrooms, and interesting info on how the chocolate is made. They also have delicious pastries for those who aren't in a chocolate mood.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I've only had one thing here. They make a smore with homemade marshmallow on a cookie/ cracker and a puddle of chocolate on top. They then toast it with a torch. Delicious!

Great sampler for bite sized appetites, the pic is upside down because I was too excited to turn it around and you get the idea anyway, it's delicious! Go for the full sized S'mores AND frozen hot chocolate! The true dark rich (but not too bitter) chocolate is well worth the wait in line, you'll see!</Review>

<text>What? This place was absolutely incredible. Not only is the bar chocolate some of the best I've ever had, the desserts (Euro drinking chocolate and the s'more pictured here) were also delicious. The facility itself operates as a mini chocolate factory including bean sorting, roasting, separating, pouring, tempering, and wrapping. It's like Willy Wonka but in real love. Can't wait to go back. Also, great place for gifts!</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBX-4c5LlSVoGZ6enbepQYQzR01pQDxtc0ah46=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics></record>

<review>I absolutely recommend Dandelion Chocolates not just because of their delicious premium chocolates (the 85% Ecuadorean one is my favorite) but because of the visiting experiences and culture (very caring and helpful staff, plus company donation policy.) They are building a new and much bigger headquarters in the Mission District, and the Ferry Building store is also fun to visit.< /review>< Pictures>

Try the little pastries from other countries, it’s really good.  If you love chocolate, you will appreciate this spot.< /review>

<date>1572810500501<//date><rating>5< /rating><review>We tried the hot chocolate here and it was amazing! We got the European hot chocolate which was super rich and creamy, definitely something you share with another person. It’s also pretty bitter and dark so if you are not a fan of dark chocolate I wouldn’t recommend this. The frozen hot chocolate would be more up your alley, it’s still rich and tastes great but not as bitter. They have housemate marshmallows which melt in your mouth! They also have free tastings of different types of their chocolates.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQWEsjdZ-S82TSao7M3UBZ5j7ruBbuGjqdsAk2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Response>

<Name>Ghanshyam Bhutra</Name><review>Great place for chocolate lovers which is open until midnight!. They have lots of hot and cold chocolate drinks to choose from but a limited amount of desserts. We reached the place about 10:30 pm and it was pretty crowded. Got the chocolate s'more and the chocolate cheesecake and both of them were very good. The cheesecake was presented in a tiny glass jar which was unique! As long as you can handle the parking this is definitely worth a try.</review><userid>118445171448903779993< /userid></record>

We don't often receive feedback that the hot chocolate is too chocolatey, so I'm curious if you had the European Drinking Chocolate or another beverage.  Our aim to create second-to-none chocolate experiences, and it sounds like we didn't hit our mark with your visit.  Please feel free to contact me directly at graeme@dandelionchocolate.com with your feedback regarding the drink and pastry you had and I will be sure to follow up to sweeten your memory of Dandelion.\n\nHope you have a great day!\n\nBest,\nGraeme Lowe\nGeneral Manager"}</Resp>

WOW! Delicious chocolate for a more sophisticated pallet. The chocolate here has some strong caffeine haha I was shaking after eating so much of it and felt very hyper. So take note of that. The atmosphere is the hipster decor of your dreams. Such a fun little place to visit in the city.< /review>

It is located on the stretch of Valencia which is home to a lot of decent restaurants. Parking in this area is always tough but you can find something on the side streets and walk a little.

The one word to describe Dandelion Chocolate would be hipster. As much as I would like to avoid that word this place screams for hipsters by hipsters. It has shelves with trendy chocolate bars (~$8/each) on the right and left-hand side and a large open area where they make the drinks and conduct classes. I think I was there around noon and the place was pretty packed so it is definitely popular. I knew what I wanted to try so I walked over to the counter and ordered a Frozen hot chocolate ($5.75). After ordering it was a short 10-minute wait and I had my drink.

I sat on one of the large open tables only to find that it was dirty and needed to be properly wiped down. Anyway, the frozen hot chocolate seems to be your typical ice blended drink (think Frappuccino) but with a lot more ice and rich chocolate. It is presented very well on a wooden plate and some whipped cream on top and a small cookie to go with it. It wasn’t something that blew my socks off but it was pretty good.

Price was also not too bad considering the location and the trendy setup. I later found out that they have opened a small outlet in the ferry building at the Embarcadero which is a-lot is closer to where I live so I guess I will be able to try to try some more stuff off their menu in due course as I liked what I got here.<//Review>< username>

<text>Great sampler for bite sized appetites, the pic is upside down because I was too excited to turn it around and you get the idea anyway, it's delicious! Go for the full sized S'mores AND frozen hot chocolate! The true dark rich (but not too bitter) chocolate is well worth the wait in line, you'll see!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>This review is an interview:
What did you like about it?
The best marshmallows I've ever had in my life. I felt good about the ethics. Supporting small global cocoa growers. Good place to have some fun and learn about chocolate. Free tasting helps it feel like a community experience, and the mission hot chocolate was excellent. Spice+cocoa was just perfect.

What can't you miss at this place?
The truffles are the best gift I've ever gotten. Don't miss on the chance to share something unique

What should people know?
They have nice seating, restrooms, and interesting info on how the chocolate is made. They also have delicious pastries for those who aren't in a chocolate mood.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f7e3d23f5dddd:0x3342559449ab0793</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dandelion is a very cute place to grab coffee but not a place that you could work from. They do not have wifi or plug points.

In terms of desserts, the tiramisu is really good and I would actually give pass on the brownies.<//Text>< Time>

<text>Awesome place to visit and experience. There are tons of free samples and options to take home but the baked goods and drinks are the real draw. Top notch all around, the Smores tart is a little salty which works really well to compliment the rich ganache on top. The drinking chocolate was way too rich for my taste but would be a huge plus in a lot of people's books, Id imagine. I took one of their info sheets and framed it in my house to remember the place by!< /text><Rate>5< /Rate>< time>

Cold brew was good. The smore was decadent. I personally didn't like the Chai drink, but my wife ordered it for herself and she liked it.
5/5 for ambiance and aesthetics!</text>

<text>Im afraid i did not like this place one bit, seating area is extremely small ( although the store is gigantic) , we ordered the -house hot chocolate, -mission hot chocolate, -celebration cake, -dulce de leche bar, as experts in chocolate/cocoa you would automatically have higher expectations in their chocolate and/or desserts unfortunately they fell too short from that, we left extremely disappointed with the overall experience as it was unpleasant to say the least starting from seating till leaving; we stood waiting for around 12-15 minutes just for some1 to leave as the seatings are only but a few, imagine doing that with 2 toddlers! ... after finally finding a table we tasted our neatly cold " hot chocolate" , i chose the mission hot chocolate which is advertised as" their spicy take on the mesoamerican original" , drinking this was like drinking lava , my internal organs felt like burning and had an upset stomach till the next day, the dulce bar was tasty however i could not say the same for the cake, cake was mediocre at best and frankly disappointing even my son didn't like it and he loves cake.. i dont like leaving bad reviews only if i really had an unpleasant experience and this was one.. wont come back and will not recommend< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6MDKlBdgGR99HrfjIDZwjrs1Cgn0YSI4Qx7lR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmTBWJDNoFUIgFh6abeB8E2yYo9mCYhn0fK6IR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_StOnQdWNk-6K1oPTI6hBPPJVD-7WUO_XHUvO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOBxhnd3JyQ7GU_z7i_cqD3hHNnuKlyYFLj3-8v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGmBoARaDceqz3dx_hI5rHkJU8es6J2rhKhGZ2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLHGoljxAiaKGL3Oaz1fYBzyVyi4j5Sd4ucT6i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5cU2xbt3op1jo1taK0J4jIJIH_MK1Osc4HIH3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaHrv1VmCgNDrlXvFswRJ2IyYRpLZXGCjcsYhk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyki1NZL-zC1N6p6-GOQUL17ts8shoPL4Lf6fV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM-LZ7zKPso4Axm_3Wuaz0Hn1vZxYibmP_U5MVI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMr1NAvCieRxZUXbziclUG6bPgni9o5A2P9rDfJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG0fb8gG3_SufPn_FA5_2V_2XmpQBjQGqT8_N5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f7e3d23f5dddd:0x3342559449ab0793<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
I've been coming here ever since they opened doors. It's a chocolate shop for and from true ardent chocolate lovers. They source the cacao beans from the best places and make chocolate right on site. You can see! They know their chocolate and you'll really love it after you try some of their samples. They also have a good 100% dark! I have liked different if their bars over time. You gotta try this place of you like chocolate and the story behind it. Plus while you are there, don't forget to get their hot chocolate. It's a legend! Love this place for all the reasons they show off!< /review>

OMG, this place is awesome and the best place for chocolate lovers. I highly recommend for you to try The Drinking Chocolate, it's perfect! So if you have so much bitterness in your life, then I guess it's time to taste sweet- visit Dandelion Chocolate!!!< /Text>

Really good chocolate! Free samples and a solid choice in chocolate drinks. This is mostly a spot for dark chocolate lovers. They have books and bars and various other additions that fit with the chocolate and beyond.< /Text>

Dandelion's chocolate cafe is a great place to grab a snack, dessert, or a chocolate-based beverage. My favorite is the frozen hot chocolate, which is exactly what it sounds like. They have delicious home-made marshmallows, as many as you want, self serve. And you can taste all their different single-batch bars, too.</text>

Free chocolate samples.  Had a Mission Hot chocolate. It was a bit too spicy for my liking. Sat at the public parquette to people watch on a sunny weekend afternoon.  Blissful. 😍<//Text>

Great chocolate.
Passive aggressive staff - we hung out at the restaurant expecting that the staff will tell us when when they are closing and then we will leave. Then abruptly the hostess tells us that our "grace period" is up and we should leave. I didn't even know we were on "grace period". So If you are there late at night make sure to do the hostesses job for her and keep tabs on the closing time and leave promptly before they close if you don't want the chocolate in your mouth to turn sour. I am so tired of San Francisco restaurants feeling like they are doing you a favor.< /Text>

It is located on the stretch of Valencia which is home to a lot of decent restaurants. Parking in this area is always tough but you can find something on the side streets and walk a little.

The one word to describe Dandelion Chocolate would be hipster. As much as I would like to avoid that word this place screams for hipsters by hipsters. It has shelves with trendy chocolate bars (~$8/each) on the right and left-hand side and a large open area where they make the drinks and conduct classes. I think I was there around noon and the place was pretty packed so it is definitely popular. I knew what I wanted to try so I walked over to the counter and ordered a Frozen hot chocolate ($5.75). After ordering it was a short 10-minute wait and I had my drink.

I sat on one of the large open tables only to find that it was dirty and needed to be properly wiped down. Anyway, the frozen hot chocolate seems to be your typical ice blended drink (think Frappuccino) but with a lot more ice and rich chocolate. It is presented very well on a wooden plate and some whipped cream on top and a small cookie to go with it. It wasn’t something that blew my socks off but it was pretty good.

Price was also not too bad considering the location and the trendy setup. I later found out that they have opened a small outlet in the ferry building at the Embarcadero which is a-lot is closer to where I live so I guess I will be able to try to try some more stuff off their menu in due course as I liked what I got here.< /Review>< pictures>

If you're going to eat chocolate, you ought to really savor it. And Dandelion is the place for that. Graze on the numerous samples while waiting in line to order cocoa or a canele, and gawk at the machinery and piles of bags of beans in the back.< /Review>

Go here. Photo is of free tasting of family farm originated cocoa bean made chocolate. Reasonable priced cookies $3, $4 items, tables. At tasting bar you can watch the chocolate being made while enjoying your treat. An operating chocolate factory so better than SF's Ghirardelli Chocolate Factory.</review>

< review>
I love Dandelion's baked goods, there's always a good balance in flavors. The various types of chocolate they make and use for them are always superbly executed and showcased. I personally don't like their drinks that they offer, seems to be wasteful of the excellent chocolate they produce.< /review>

<name>Fractal Glow</name><text>So good! Stopped by to find a non-alcoholic place to relax just as most of the cafes we're closing, this was perfect. The first time I was here we tried the sampler and remember loving the smore and the custard-like one, so this time we went with just the creamy one (forgot name), it was great with chocolate crumbly things on top. We also tried the iced chai, which was interesting, definitely not as sweet or rich/chocolatey, but a bit more soft. Great staff, great atmosphere and decor.<//text><gmap_id>0x808f7e3d23f5dddd:0x3342559449ab0793< /gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

Possibly the best chocolate in the SF Bay Area. Sustainably sourced, bean to bar, hand crafted chocolate.</review>

<Text>Delicious vegan chocolate. Food Empowerment Project, which investigates chocolate labor sourcing, recommends them. Their bars are each made with only beans and sugar. Cacao fruit smoothie is delicious (some may not like the tartness). All their drinks are lovely. Horchata for the win. They need vegan pastries.</Text><Date>1555223596028<//Date>< rate>

<Review>Very cool spot - loved the chocolate samples from all around the world and that it is an actual factory.  For me the thick European drinking hot chocolate is the best.  It’s hard to find.  Small portion in a clay cup to keep the heat but it’s nothing but real melted chocolate! Pictured is a chocolate tasting - this was ok - nicely displayed I didn’t mind that I didn’t love every item.  The passion fruit macaron and panna cotta were the better of the items featured<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgDhSLEKIXnJo5m1Q7ipycS32FiBNiA3VaTCRQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

I recommend the sampler and mission hot chocolate. It's a bit spicy but the kick is nice, especially on a foggy day. The sampler provides variety without overwhelming your stomach considering you probably had dinner beforehand. Personally, I love the smore and the marshmallows.</text>

<text>There is a great variety of dark chocolate from different parts of the world. There are small samples. But the chocolate guy also gave us a sample of the silky chocolate machine. The bars will cost a pretty penny. Great place for someone who appreciates and savors chocolate.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Great chocolate.
Passive aggressive staff - we hung out at the restaurant expecting that the staff will tell us when when they are closing and then we will leave. Then abruptly the hostess tells us that our "grace period" is up and we should leave. I didn't even know we were on "grace period". So If you are there late at night make sure to do the hostesses job for her and keep tabs on the closing time and leave promptly before they close if you don't want the chocolate in your mouth to turn sour. I am so tired of San Francisco restaurants feeling like they are doing you a favor.<//Text>< Pictures>

Very cool spot - loved the chocolate samples from all around the world and that it is an actual factory.  For me the thick European drinking hot chocolate is the best.  It’s hard to find.  Small portion in a clay cup to keep the heat but it’s nothing but real melted chocolate! Pictured is a chocolate tasting - this was ok - nicely displayed I didn’t mind that I didn’t love every item.  The passion fruit macaron and panna cotta were the better of the items featured<//review>

Got a cup of hot chocolate. It contained about a half a cup of sugar. Disgustingly sweet, made me feel sick. 0 stars. 2 stars for having cacao fruit smoothie but it could have been executed better as well.</Text>

<text>All the drinks are so tasty, but most recently and given the warm weather, I've been loving the frozen hot chocolate. I love the counter / bar seats where I can enjoy my drink + tiny bit of short bread and just do some work.

< review>
The smell emanating onto Valencia Street led us into the sensory “experience” that is Dandelion Chocolate – and while we’re not that big on sweets, we couldn’t really resist following our noses into this popular spot.. No one can.

After testing out a few chocolate samples from around the world and the bite-size home-made marshmallows, we grabbed a seat at the coffee bar for the feature attraction. For most, that’s usually the hot chocolate.

For us, it was the beautiful marriage of dark chocolate and coffee, otherwise knows as their speciality Marocchino drink, that got our full attention. Equal portion dark chocolate and espresso, this drink is served with a side of fluffy whipped cream to add that sweetness right when you need it.< /review>

Excellent chocolate, with an excellent selection to choose from. If you get any drinks here be warned they are extremely rich and delicious. You should be prepared to spend a while here sipping away at it or taking it to go. I was not able to finish mine in 20 minutes, it was just too rich for my tummy to handle all in one go.</Text>

For serious though, this place is lovely. Come here after dinner for a beautiful dessert, coffee and conversation. You'll score major points with a date. I loved the whole experience. Would recommend, would return.</review>

Absolutely incredible place. Chocolate is great. So is there desserts drinks. But that's only part of it. Many  different types of chocolate from all over the world, with descriptions of each. Plus once your done, you can visit all the other great places around that area. In total, I would give it a 20/10.</text>

<Text>I go to Dandelion every time I'm in San Francisco - it is by far the best hot chocolate I've been able to find. I always get the European drinking chocolate because the thick hot chocolate is my style and it is fantastic. It comes in a small cup and you feel you aren't getting much but it is so rich and thick that it will really satiate your sweet tooth.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

They have great chocolate choices. You are able to try different types of chocolate from Different regent. Must stop by while in mission.</text>

<text>We had an absolutely incredible experience here. Despite being a very busy Saturday afternoon, Andre took the time to show us around the chocolate making area, explain their process from bean sourcing to wrapping, and shared several samples with us. We ended with a flight of brownies which were all fantastic (but note to my future self: the Ecuador was my favorite).<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Date>

Love love love the European hot chocolate. And it’s served in such a special way, with the marshmallow and the little cookie. It’s quite special to drink that at the bar and watch how chocolate gets made in the big machines too, and be able to taste the beans themselves when they have those available.< /text>

<text>Excellent chocolate, with an excellent selection to choose from. If you get any drinks here be warned they are extremely rich and delicious. You should be prepared to spend a while here sipping away at it or taking it to go. I was not able to finish mine in 20 minutes, it was just too rich for my tummy to handle all in one go.< /text>< pics>

<Text>V dank chocolate experience. They have a tasting shelf with a variety of chocolates. Their hot chocolates are not as sweet as store bought hot chocolate and deeper in flavors.

All the drinks are so tasty, but most recently and given the warm weather, I've been loving the frozen hot chocolate. I love the counter / bar seats where I can enjoy my drink + tiny bit of short bread and just do some work. Love that I can see the kitchen and the tours, great background noise to be productive.<//review>

A must-visit for all Chocolate lovers! Upon entry to your left, they have a nice variety of chocolate bars (nicely wrapped) with trays of samples you can taste. The bars are perfect for gift giving & they come from exotic countries such as Belize, Guatamala, Madagascar, Peru, etc. They offer factory tours, tasting, classes, recipes, & an on-site drink/dessert menu. There's something for everyone here.</text>

Cool little shop with a bunch of tasty chocolate. I don't love coffee so it's really cool to have a place to go that has such good hot chocolate! They have a ton of information about chocolate, classes on how to make chocolate and they make it from the beans right on site. A bit hipster but we'll worth a visit!< /review>

Thank heavens for the trend of fresh made chocolate - of course, small batches, artisan and all the right buzzwords :)

Great service, even better gourmet chocolate and coffee and pastries. They take their chocolate seriously here. It shows.

Very limited seating but it's almost always possible to find some seating given the quick turnover. It's fun to sit and watch how it's all made and enjoy the aroma.<//Text>

This place is on my "24 hrs in SF recommendations" list. Taste all the chocolate! Buy sipping chocolate! Try their desserts! Use their bathroom! Eat (very very sweet) marshmallows!

I love their bean-to-bar method, the stories they share about their cocoa farmer partners.< /Text>

The vibe is similar to a busy coffee shop (long line that moves fast, lots of fast-working employees, loud grinding of cocoa beans, not too many places to sit) so I would not recommend for a date or talking. They do have outside seating, but when I was there the heaters were turned off. I plan on trying the other treats for sure!</Review><response>None</response>< user_id>

Stopped by on a whim while visiting the Mission District. Most of Dandelion’s chocolates are of a single source origin so you know exactly where the cocoa beans are from and the flavors are quite rich and complex. Samples of each of the chocolates are available in their shop, so you can taste before you buy.< /Text>

The air was thick with chocolate as we entered what feels like an old warehouse gone hipster.

We sampled some bits of dark chocolate from Ecuador, Tanzania, wherever, ranging from 70% to the pure real deal of 100% cacao. Yowsa!

Ordering a couple of overpriced glasses of "traditional" hot chocolate, with almond milk instead of the regular cow variety, we sat at a communal wooden table, sipping our viscous elixirs that took us to another world as we discussed the possibility of minimum chocolate standards for the masses akin to minimum wages.

Yes, we were high on life, in albeit away from the rest of the world.<//Review>

I am not even a chocolate fan and I like Dandelion Chocolate... a lot. The place smells amazing for one, and their chocolate bars are so good! I love that you can sample them before deciding which bar to devour on your own. They have a large selection of chocolate desserts and drinks and so forth, and I was really tempted to get the chocolate dessert sampler... But it was just before dinner so I didn't want to ruin my appetite.

Dandelion bars make great gifts for whoever loves and appreciates good chocolate - I love that they have year and place of origin, and it makes every batch super special and difficult to find elsewhere. A super cool gift I saw in store too was a make your own chocolate kit - with beans and everything!

I found out when I visited that they have chocolate factory tours - if I ever go back, I'm hitting that for sure.<//Text>

Love love love the European hot chocolate. And it’s served in such a special way, with the marshmallow and the little cookie. It’s quite special to drink that at the bar and watch how chocolate gets made in the big machines too, and be able to taste the beans themselves when they have those available.</Review>

<text>Some of the best hot chocolate here. The chocolate really is decadent for lack of a better word. Rich creamy chocolatey goodness that you can't resist if you're having a chocolate craving. They also have homemade marshmallows, however these I didn't find particularly stunning and were probably worse than your typical marshmellow.<//text>< pictures>

Not bad but the only milks they have are dairy and almond. It would be nice to see more non-dairy milks and vegan pastry options.</Text>

<review>Amazing hot cocoa! Marshmellows and sugar is included with your cocoa (if you want it) and the baked goods are worth going for as well. The vibe is similar to a busy coffee shop (long line that moves fast, lots of fast-working employees, loud grinding of cocoa beans, not too many places to sit) so I would not recommend for a date or talking. They do have outside seating, but when I was there the heaters were turned off. I plan on trying the other treats for sure!<//review>< pics>

Great chocolate store, which is definitely foodie-worthy, and functions as an exhibit of the whole chocolate making and curing process.  They have delicious tidbits and little bites, along with fantastic hot chocolate and mocha coffees.  The die-hard chocolate lover will want the European drinking chocolate, the Mission resident will want the spicy Mission Hot Chocolate, and the kids will love the hot chocolate or "PB&J".

The also sell bars, beans, and a few other gift items.  My least favorite drink has been the mocha cappuccino because it's relative light on chocolate.</text>

<Review>Cute and busy little chocolate cafe right on Valencia. With the outdoor seating, it's popular during warmer days. My husband and I got a seat inside on a crowded Saturday; I got the spicy mocha with cayenne pepper. It was similar to a Mexican Hot Chocolate, rich and chocolatey with an espresso kick. If you're getting a hot chocolate, don't hesitate to top it with the house-made marshmallows, and the chocolate covered shortbread they sell is heavenly. Snag a seat at the bar to watch the chocolate-makers do their work, as a sign says they love questions.< /Review>< pics>

Nice hot cocoa, one of the best in town. I always have the thicker European style. Cakes and pastries look great but are not as good as the hot chocolate.

Service is quite reay great. Adonis, one of the staff, is always super nice and patient as I ask him questions about their chocolate.

The quality of the cocoa is really good. One day I would like to take one of their courses to learn more about chocolate.<//review>

Cute and busy little chocolate cafe right on Valencia. With the outdoor seating, it's popular during warmer days. My husband and I got a seat inside on a crowded Saturday; I got the spicy mocha with cayenne pepper. It was similar to a Mexican Hot Chocolate, rich and chocolatey with an espresso kick. If you're getting a hot chocolate, don't hesitate to top it with the house-made marshmallows, and the chocolate covered shortbread they sell is heavenly. Snag a seat at the bar to watch the chocolate-makers do their work, as a sign says they love questions.</Text>

Great products, worth a visit. Try to get on a tour! From the packaging to the end product there's a huge amount of quality and impeccable taste. And the hot chocolate is amazing.</Text>

<time>1418705200964<//time><text>Chocolate is really good. Great single origin chocolate. The bar made from Madagascar beans tastes like strawberry, so much fruitiness and nice acidity.

Cacao fruit smoothie is neat, hadn't had that elsewhere. Little too sweet though.

Plus, the Chocolate 201 class was awesome -- rather expensive but a really unique experience. I made a kilo of delicious chocolate from scratch: got to choose which beans to use and how much sugar. Learned how to crack and winnow and roast beans, and also got a nice in-depth tour of the whole process at Dandelion.< /text>< user_name>

< Review>
Dandelion Chocolate has a winning formula: they educate you about chocolate, they let you try samples, the employees really seem to love what they do & everything I've had so far is quite tasty!  My favorite is definitely the European style hot chocolate - absolutely delicious.  If you happen to be in the Mission, definitely give it a go!<//Review>

The best chocolate I have ever had. They really took their time to develop the flavors. You have never had real chocolate until you come to this place. Interior decor is nice and clean, I like the style they convey. Overall great place!< /Review>

Wow. This was an amazing find!
I tried their hot chocolate and it was amazing. The balance between sugar and chocolate and the texture of the chocolate was superb.
NOTE: If you like "sweet" chocolate, you might be disappointed by their offerings.
These guys have an awesome chocolate--it is all about the texture. Do not avoid their chocolate just because it is not loaded with sugar.
Try everything they have. I loved almost everything I tried; I love dark chocolate and low-sugar chocolate.
Highly recommended.</review>

<Review>Incredible chocolates made the way chocolate should be made with just a few ingredients.  They usually sample a few flavors near the front of the store and I was blown away with the contrast of some of the flavors that differ simply by origin.
The space is large, like a coffee house, with plenty of seating to enjoy coffee or hang out and watch them make chocolate.<//Review><gmapID>0x808f7e3d23f5dddd:0x3342559449ab0793</gmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This place is magical. From the moment you open the door and the sweet smell of chocolate gives you a big hug you can tell you've come to a good place. While I've bought Dandelion Chocolate bars for a while now because I'm obsessed with their gorgeous packaging, I only recently realized that they are made with just 2 ingredients: cocoa beans and cane sugar. That's incredible! And the people that work here are more than happy to tell you just how they do it. Their cafe has delicious pastries and drinks, of which I highly recommend trying the Lemon Ginger Iced Chocolate - my new favorite treat!</Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< UserId.>

<text>One of my favorite places in SF! Located on hip, bustling Valencia St, Dandelion Chocolate is a chocolate-lover's heaven. Handmade, single-origin chocolates and desserts. Must-tries: frozen hot chocolate (for hot/sunny days) and the European drinking chocolate (super thick, hot, rich -- sip slowly). There are complimentary housemade marshmallows at the drink station as well. The only negative is how crowded this place gets now.

Dandelion also does fantastic, $5/person tours and demonstrations of the small facilities that include tastings of chocolate pieces and chocolate straight from the melting vat. These tours are booked up MONTHS in advance though, so plan ahead!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

What a find! I'm so happy to have stumbled across Dandelion Chocolate. From the moment you walk in, you know you're in for a treat. All that chocolately goodness is in the air and it smells heavenly. The chocolate samples while waiting in line was a productive use of time. You can learn first hand how the varied the flavors can be. The staff are super friendly. There's a nice selection of baked goods to sample from. I was pleasantly surprised that my baked good weren't over-the-top sweet. The European hot chocolate and iced chocolate chai were amazing. You can sit and enjoy your chocolate treats while watching the chocolate makers in action. I love that Dandelion is all about educating people on the whole chocolate making process. Next on my list is having a  factory tour.<//Text>

Somehow everytime I visit SF I end up here. Usually the line is very long, but they have free chocolate and books you can read while you wait. I shared the Chef's Tasting with two other people and it was 100% worth it; really happy I ordered something. Really want to come back here and take a class one day!<//review>

If you like dark chocolate this the Willy Wonka experience for adults. Lots of single-origin bars cocoa nibs and fresh hot intense flavor chocolate for drinking. You can even buy your own chocolate making kit, and the staff are quite helpful. Love it.</review>

Dark chocolate from all over the world, all of it high quality. Their bars are expensive but they have samples of all of them available so you don't waste your money. The European sipping chocolate is also delicious.< /Review>

<review>Perfect sweet stop on a cold afternoon in SF! I've heard so many things about dandelion chocolate and their hot chocolate, I had to go in the store haha. Though I was only there for about 10 minutes, I could tell that they put a lot of effort in their chocolates. Definitely high-quality and they provided information cards on each bark of chocolate (e.g. source, location, etc.). Nice staff and great atmosphere!

Anyways, I ended getting their house hot chocolate. It was warm and delicious but on the sweeter side for me. Hopefully next time, I can try the mission hot chocolate instead! When I received the drink, a biscuit was provided and house-made marshmallows were available at the bar.<//review>< user_id>

Dandelion's small batch chocolate is the best! You can really tell they use only the highest quality beans that bring out different flavor profiles. Go there for the pastries, hot chocolate, or the tasting and tours. A great stop on a Saturday afternoon.</Review>

If you are not a fan of dark, fruity chocolate, Dandelion might not be for you. BUT if you are like me and love dark chocolate more than any other sweet, this spot is for you. Even if you aren't a connoisseur of dark chocolate, you can still visit and get a delicious coffee or hot AND iced chocolate drink. Definitely a fun place to stop if you are in the area.<//review>

<Text>Delicious locally-made chocolates with plenty of free samples of the bars to try before you buy. The desserts here are yummy and they offer tours (by reservation) for only $5 - well worth it for all of the info you get, plus more samples as you learn about the chocolate making process. The only negative I have is that even though the store hours say that they're open until 9, I've gone by a few times after 6 and they've been closed for tours, private events, or other reasons. My favorite bar of chocolate is from madagascar. Fruity and delicious!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Did a walking pastry and dessert walk in the Mission when another location recommended I add Dandelion to my day that was months ago and now any time I'm in the city and even close I have to pop back over.   Love that you can see them making small batches of chocolate onsite, they do have different tours calendar is on the wall

Decor is nice and cozy usually fresh flowers in the tables and always busy!   There is seating outside,  inside tables and the bar area but fills up quickly.  Always friendly service.

Yummy drinks and desserts plus mini Merch section and chocolate samples what's not to love?<//Review>

Fantastic chocolate, good feel inside. I especially like that you can walk back further into the store and see workers sorting chocolate and creating the products that they sell.

Try the home made marshmallows.< /text>

<review>I went on a Friday afternoon and it wasn’t as crowded as I would have expected. My friend and I shared an iced chocolate which was good but quickly became too sweet towards the end.

Excellent hot chocolate. Excellent place for a date! Upon walking in, you can sample the dark chocolate nibs from a variety of countries. This establishment hosts tours (I will have to check those out in summer since apparently they are booked solid for the next 6 months). They make also excellent desserts. We split the huge smore that was so decadent (a piece of chocolate that was in the middle of the marshmallow). The interior of the place is very open and airy. I will be coming back here again in a heart beat.</text>

One of my favorite places in SF! Located on hip, bustling Valencia St, Dandelion Chocolate is a chocolate-lover's heaven. Handmade, single-origin chocolates and desserts. Must-tries: frozen hot chocolate (for hot/sunny days) and the European drinking chocolate (super thick, hot, rich -- sip slowly). There are complimentary housemade marshmallows at the drink station as well. The only negative is how crowded this place gets now.

Dandelion also does fantastic, $5/person tours and demonstrations of the small facilities that include tastings of chocolate pieces and chocolate straight from the melting vat. These tours are booked up MONTHS in advance though, so plan ahead!</review>

Go here when I visit SF. I tried the hot chocolate which was of course very good, it's a chocolate specialty place. The service was average for a walkup counter style restaurant/shop.<//text>

This place has delightful small batch chocolate! Everything (including the bar wrapping to the customer experience) is done with care. As a big dark chocolate fan, the 70% Mantuano, Venezuela is one of my favourite bars.< /Review>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>I went on a Friday afternoon and it wasn’t as crowded as I would have expected. My friend and I shared an iced chocolate which was good but quickly became too sweet towards the end. Good for the novelty and maybe to buy some bars as gifts, but honestly overpriced like most millennial, gentrifying places in the Mission.</Text><resp>None<//resp>< UserId.>

<review>If you are someone who savors the subtle, distinct flavor nuances of regional cacao beans like some savor coffee, don't miss this amazing local small-batch chocolate producer.  There was little else to purchase beyond single-origin chocolate bars, but plenty of opportunity to sample these and make sure you are getting something you will enjoy.  My favorite, the 70% Cumboto, Venezuela bar, came beautifully wrapped in Dandelion's signature, cream-and-gold textured paper.</review>< name>

A destination not to be missed if you are a fan of chocolate! From their drinking chocolate to each dessert they offer, you can't make a wrong choice here. It can get crowded if you opt to sit inside, and the line is frequently out the door, but it's definitely worth the wait in line.</review>

Small batch chocolate used in unique desserts (a chocolate spritzer?). My favorite part is the ability to sample chocolate from different regions as well as a raw cacao nib & learn about how the chocolate is made. I know they're chocolatiers, but their homemade marshmallows are the tastiest thing I've eaten - SO good!</Text>

Really like this place. It’s a bourgey spot, as you would expect to see on Valencia. But they have tons of free chocolate to taste, and it’s definitely worth stopping in if you’re walking around the area. Great date spot too.</text>

<Text>Did a walking pastry and dessert walk in the Mission when another location recommended I add Dandelion to my day that was months ago and now any time I'm in the city and even close I have to pop back over.   Love that you can see them making small batches of chocolate onsite, they do have different tours calendar is on the wall

Decor is nice and cozy usually fresh flowers in the tables and always busy!   There is seating outside,  inside tables and the bar area but fills up quickly.  Always friendly service.

Yummy drinks and desserts plus mini Merch section and chocolate samples what's not to love?</Text>< pics>

Wonderful place to visit—the whole place smells of chocolate! Small-batch, single-sourced chocolate made right in front of you. Ask the staff there about the chocolate they're working on and they might give you a free sample! The hot cocoa and housemade sweets are incredible, and of course all of the chocolate bars are top-notch. Definitely stop by if you're in the neighborhood!< /review>

Editing my previous post based on the terrible experience I just had in the new factory location. I went to the new factory location, we ordered the hot frozen chocolate and despite not being listed as an ingredient it contains dairy (which my friend is allergic) We had to leave in a rush to the hospital, terrible experience!< /Review>

Possibly the best chocolate you can get in North America, with wonderful ethics that make it taste that much better. We order online frequently and they have excellent online customer service and package their chocolates with care. Treat yourself to their chocolates, often!</Text>

Did a walking pastry and dessert walk in the Mission when another location recommended I add Dandelion to my day that was months ago and now any time I'm in the city and even close I have to pop back over.   Love that you can see them making small batches of chocolate onsite, they do have different tours calendar is on the wall

Decor is nice and cozy usually fresh flowers in the tables and always busy!   There is seating outside,  inside tables and the bar area but fills up quickly.  Always friendly service.

Yummy drinks and desserts plus mini Merch section and chocolate samples what's not to love?<//text>

This is a chocolate lover's paradise! Really awesome chocolate varieties. Staff here are very friendly and helpful. I love smelling the cocoa bean samples in the store...and for those who are really serious about chocolate, they offer chocolate-making classes.< /text>

Having a bad day? Sugar craving? Perhaps you need something to warm your or your friends' soul? Dandelion offers an impeccable variety of hot and cold chocolates to warm you and your friends' lost soul(s) into creamy loveliness. If you are afraid you will forget that lovely feeling, take home a few of the gourmet homemade chocolate bars packaged with a simple ribbon to treat yourself, or those who you are grateful to have in your life. :)<//Review>

Amazing hot chocolate - the European one is like a melted bar of chocolate in a small cup - delicious. Can sample few types of chocolate on the side while waiting in line. Nice space to sit down and enjoy what you got.<//review>

It was really really good...super soft, even turning softer after sitting at room temperature for several hours. Flavor is truly wonderful as well. But just not as good as the San Fran spot...but quite sensational in CA!! Will come back again!!< /text>< pics>

The chocolate is fantastic and is made in such a variety of ways to bring out subtle flavors to pack an amazing punch. I definetly have to say that one should order much less than they think they can eat, as the chocolate drinks and desserts are dense and fill you up very fast.< /Text>

<text>So I'm walking down Valencia St for the first time and my friend asks, "want to learn a pro-tip?" I reply, yes.....

She turns and opens the door to Dandelion Chocolate, and immediately, my nose is filled with the ripe aroma of cacao. It's not a sweet smell, like normal chocolate, but bitter, like natural chocolate.

The pro-tip? They have bowls of free samples. The samples are good enough to convince you to buy their products, and I highly recommend it!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><user_name>Deanna</user_name>< Rate>

<Text>Enjoyable and educational. Did you know, Dandelion is the ONLY place in the Western United States that makes smoothies out of the pulpy stuff in the pod in which cacao ferments. See what you learn from going on a tour. Walk to the rear and you may see chocolate production going on behind the service area. In the relatively short time this location has been open, we are seeing the long-line-for-popular-mission-place phenomenon. Here's a tip: you can fortify yourself for your time in line by reaching to the left for a sample. It's OK, even encouraged, just please use the spoon provided.<//Text>< name>

To be clear, I like chocolate, especially fine European chili are. But, this place is overrated, unless you explicitly LOVE chocolate. Cold hot chocolate is pretty good, but hot chocolate is too thick... the sweets are quite so-so, and quite pricy.<//Text>

Enjoyable and educational. Did you know, Dandelion is the ONLY place in the Western United States that makes smoothies out of the pulpy stuff in the pod in which cacao ferments. See what you learn from going on a tour. Walk to the rear and you may see chocolate production going on behind the service area. In the relatively short time this location has been open, we are seeing the long-line-for-popular-mission-place phenomenon. Here's a tip: you can fortify yourself for your time in line by reaching to the left for a sample. It's OK, even encouraged, just please use the spoon provided.<//review>

< review>
It's basically a Mission cliche: a store with amazing food (or products) with bad hours and poor customer service. If you manage to make it there when it's open you'll be able to get extremely rich and delicious hot chocolate and other treats. The hipster behind the counter will probably look irritated to serve you, but hey maybe it's performance art or they are only working ironically.

I recommend the original hot chocolate over the mission. Both are good but the spices in the mission I thought were too strong. As for their chocolate bars: go for the Madagascar it tastes like it has sweet fruit in it.</review>

The hot chocolate was absolutely amazing.  So rich and creamy.  Quite possibly the best I've ever had.  If you're into chocolate this is a must stop.< /Review>

Amazing place! Slightly pricy but totally worth. A must have for foodies who like chocolate.

I suggest pairing a hot chocolate with a small bite on the side of an afternoon. Don't come too late, they run out of some things since everything is fresh.<//review>

As an adult, this place is what Ghirardelli was for me as a kid. It's part production facility, part store, and part kitchen. You can buy chocolate bars, eat well-made desserts, and sample single-origin chocolate from all over the world. The chocolate is on par with the more expensive chocolate I've had; if I remember correctly, it's over $8/bar.

Is it the best chocolate in the world? Frankly I don't know enough about chocolate. I've tried Ritual, which some people consider the best, and I think it's very good. Dandelion is also very good. That's about as specific as I can get.< /Text>

<text>Amazing little place.  Chocolates have 2 ingredients: cacao & cane sugar - that's it!  And the coffees are great.  Had a dairy-free Mission Mocha Coffee (coffee with chocolate and spices, almond grindings and almond milk) it was such a good drink I can't wait to have another (after I jog it off in a few miles ha ha).</text>< pics>

< Review>
Personally, I don't feel Dandelion Chocolate is worth the hype. I've been 3 times, each time I ate there and got different items (1st time: a chocolate chip cookie, 2nd time: the Chef's chocolate sampler, 3rd time: a chocolate brownie). The stuff tastes good, but its expensive and really hyped up for what it is. Every time I've gone there has been a line out the door, and sitting inside is a mess. If you sit at one of the front tables it's always crowded by people trying to get their orders. The crowds really take away from the experience for me. They do have cute gift boxes full of chocolate - just be sure to take it to-go!<//Review>

We did a tour of the factory and got to taste their different chocolates. All of the ones we tasted had 70% cacao and were not bitter at all. The beans from Madagascar actually tasted slightly like orange. Absolutely amazing chocolates.<//text>

So many reasons to love this place... Ranging from a 100% dark chocolate bar (that, when eaten properly (rest a small piece on your tongue, when you haven't had anything sweet recently), is delectable), to the Cacao Fruit Smoothie, which tastes nothing like chocolate (because it's not from the beans – it's white!), it's just a dreamy icy fruity sweet drink, a great counterpoint to the 100%, if you go in that order. Or there's the PB&J bar, or the Dulce de Leche, or... Yeah, lots of yummy in between the extremes of the 100% and the smoothie.</Text>

This place is awesome - the owners actually travel all across the world to find the right cacao beans!
If you're a chocolate person, you'll absolutely LOVE this place.

On a cold or rainy day, I recommend you go in for a cup of thick hot chocolate here. Yuuuuuuum <3< /review>

Single origin chocolate. These guys have taken the same approach to coffee and to wine to chocolate. Also, their cocoa drinks are excellent and so are the desserts< /Review>

What the hell? I tried a mocha and a hot chocolate. Talk about trying to stick out. They do, as the worst mocha and hot cocoa I've ever had. Had a little overpriced brownie thing too that was not bad, not great. Load of hipster crap if you ask me. Neat building, so 2 stars.< /Text>

Good chocolate, especially with the samples for each type of bar is very helpful in picking out the best bar for your tasting preference. Not a fan of their hot chocolate due to its density but love their iced hot chocolate and s'mores!< /review>

Best hot chocolate! If you're really craving chocolate get the thick European drinking chocolate. Otherwise the Mexican hot chocolate is spicy and delicious.

*Also, it's surprisingly a great place to work/study. Free wifi, lots of open seats during the week and the best 90s playlists.<//Text>

<Text>I came here for some Four Barrel coffee on a day where we had walked around and window shopped, regular shopped, day drank, and brunched. The whole experience was very delightful. They have homemade marshmallow for your coffee or hot chocolate if that's your thing (it should be). Excited to get some chocolate here, it all smelled amazing and they had little samples out. They really take pride in it, you can tell. I like that about a place. It means something.
IT MEANS SOMETHING YOU GUYS.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Be prepared to be mesmerized by the smell of chocolate as soon as you walk in!  This is a small batch chocolate maker right in the mission district.  There are samples of different chocolates for you to try while you wait.  I had the cold chocolate and the smores.  Yum.  Definitely a nice treat to enjoy!< /Text>

Dandelion Chocolate Factory is both a small factory and a cafe that serves drinks and chocolatey treats.  Note that as far as food goes, they only have desserts on their menu, no regular food such as sandwiches.<//Review>

So so overrated! Is it good yeah is it amazing no, not at all!

It was our first time here, so R & I shared the Chef's Tasting so we can have a little of everything. The cocoa spritzer was not good, at all! The other things were good, average. Like a peanut butter and jelly cup it's pretty hard not mess it up. The down side was that considering that it's a chocolate place there wasn't an emphasis enough on the actual chocolate. We were expecting way more chocolaty flavors from those deserts. My favorite by far was the nib-infused panna cotta.

I will come here again and try their drinks because they looked better than the deserts.<//text>

<review>Dandelion's single-origin chocolate bars are the fine wine of chocolate. The complex flavors roll onto the tongue in layers. I also enjoyed a marocchino during my visit. That smell chocolate makes when it's baking? Dandelion successfully captured it in a drink for the marocchino. It's small but a must try for lovers of a rich chocolate flavor. On top of that, there is a homemade marshmallow jar. I've never experienced a homemade marshmallow until I came here. I don't know if I can properly enjoy store-bought anymore now. Definitely visit if you are in the area or planning to go to Tartine!</review><rating>5< /rating>< Response>

[Warning: Young adults from Central Florida in for vacation] We tried their largest chocolate sampler tray which featured THEIR CHOCOLATE IN FIVE FORMS DESSERT FORMS. The Panna Cotta was my favorite for its contrast of creamy, crunchy, bitter and sweet. The S’more was cool because it somehow featured the toasted marshmallow encased in the brittle shell of chocolate. We also took a Marocchino (DRINKING CHOCOLATE WITH ESPRESSO and whipped cream) which was thick, delicious, and also a great balance of bitter, sweet, and creamy. For a small fee you can join the tour, but it didn’t look like they entered the actual facilities, so we opted not to. There’s plenty of seating at the front to enjoy their offerings and even space for those to hangout with their laptops and books. It was a very WELCOMING AND SURPRISINGLY CASUAL place.</Text>

They have tours of their factory which have to be booked in advance for just 5$. We learnt the journey of chocolate from beans to packaged bar. They even give gift cards for free hot chocolate at the end of the tour. Plus they have free samples of all their different chocolate varieties.<//text>

Had the frozen mocha hot chocolate which was nice. The cacao fruit smoothies don't taste too much like chocolate but a refreshing drink.

Today for desserts they had pumpkin pie in a jar, malt cookie sandwiches, nutella stuffed cookies, a smores dessert, and a flight of brownies. They also sell 3 chocolate bars for $20 which makes a nice gift.

Service is good and my favorite place to sit is along the bar that leads toward the restroom; much quieter than from the seats up front.< /Review>

I love the hot chocolate, especially the home made marshmallows, and the dulce de leche bar. But you really can't go wrong with any of their treats. Their chocolate has strong, usually delicious flavors, and they let you sample it all before buying so you can be sure you will get something you like. It's not cheap, though!<//text>

< Review>
I always drop in here to sample little pieces of chocolates for free when I pass by. Then one day, I actually decided to BUY something. Yeah, that was a fairly new concept for my Asian cheapskate brain. Yes, the double malt chocolate cook was $3.88 after tax but BOY WAS IT DELICIOUS. Chewy and not overly sweet. I had a taste of my friend's toffee chocolate brittle and that was very satisfying as well.

The bad? It's always busy, crowded, and bustling in there, which kind of ruins the vibe.</Review>

Intense chocolate (with free samples) and one of the best mochas I have ever tried.

Good connectivity, but not enough seating to be an easy place to get work done on a weekend</Text>

<text>I love the hot chocolate, especially the home made marshmallows, and the dulce de leche bar. But you really can't go wrong with any of their treats. Their chocolate has strong, usually delicious flavors, and they let you sample it all before buying so you can be sure you will get something you like. It's not cheap, though!</text><gmapID>0x808f7e3d23f5dddd:0x3342559449ab0793<//gmapID>< Rate>

<rating>5</rating><text>If you are a true lover of chocolate in it's intense, mind altering deliciousness you should stop here.  One of the very few places in the entire country where you can see actual cocoa beans roasted and turned into bars of chocolate.  Give yourself over to a chocolate tasting experience that rivals the most sophisticated wine tasting you might have done in Napa or Sonoma county.  Since they only use the cocoa beans and sugar in the making of their chocolate, Dandelion chocolate bars express the climate and soil these beans inhabit, from Venezuela to Madagascar.  It doesn't hurt that the people here are quite friendly and informative.  Walking into this place one smell told me I was somewhere special.  To paraphrase one very nice person, Life is a journey, Dandelion chocolates is the destination.  You have arrived.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
This is one of my favorite places in the city. I remember first walking into the shop and thinking, "Wow, whoever owns this shop must really love chocolate!"

Delicious chocolate with only two ingredients: cacao beans and sugar. They even offer free tours of their factory, where they tell you about how they source their beans, and the different machines they use in every part of the process from bean shelling to liquification.

The decor and interior design is also beautiful -- many of their serving tools I've learned are items they've curated while traveling around the world -- the tiny spoons from Japan, the oak serving platters from Italy.

It's a great (noisy, but I don't mind) place to read a book or get some work done.

I generally don't like dessert (it's too sweet) but the desserts here are to-die-for. They even have complimentary hand-made marshmallows that you can put in your coffee or hot chocolate.</Review>

A real life chocolate factory in the heart of the Mission. Every time I go, I stuff myself with enough chocolate tasting nibs, spicy hot chocolate drank, and free fluffy marshmallows to qualify for the roles of 3 of the 5 horrible Wonka children in that movie (the Gene Wilder one, not that Johnny Depp abomination). Go here.<//text>

<text>Chocolate in it's most pure form.  They make it on site and serve it up in a myriad of forms.  The bars are a great place to start, but don't miss the Cacao smoothie, it's a tropical drink you can't find anywhere else.

Sadly the deserts are not as good as they once were.  The popup chefs are trying though.  The toasted smore was fabulous.  Get it if you can.< /text>< pictures>

Excellent place to have chocolate. Also, you have a chance to learn about the making process there. It is a little bit expensive.<//Review>

I found the nibby horchata a little to rich but could imagine somebody else loving it.< /Text>< pics>

Due to my inability to find the Pie Fridays cart two weeks back, I had the good fortune of finally stumbling into this fantastic (not-so-)little chocolate shop that I'd completely forgotten I desperately wanted to try. My friend and I end up getting their:

* House Hot Chocolate - Ever since winter started settling in, I've been ordering hot chocolate almost every time I see it at a cafe. Dandelion's hot chocolate has probably been among the best I've had in recent memory, striking a great balance between sweet and bitter. Served on a little plate with a shortbread cookie and a few small pieces of their chocolate as well.

* Frozen Hot Chocolate - This one I was a little less fanatical about, only because it was on the darker, more bitter side of things. And I'm not even talking bittersweet, but more of a dark chocolate kind of bitter. That's not to say it wasn't enjoyable, but, unlike my chocolate, I definitely prefer my drinking chocolates a bit on the more sugary side. Like the other hot chocolate, this was also served with a cookie and chocolate.

* Dulce de Leche - From the shop's description, you already know this dessert bar is going to be on the sweet side. So, I was admittedly a little hesitant to order this along with the house hot chocolate. but they actually made for a great pairing, as the hot chocolate was bittersweet enough to offset the tasty decadence of this dessert.

* Smore - The smore was to the frozen hot chocolate as the dulce de leche was to the house hot chocolate: just okay. The flavors weren't bad, but the entire thing would have benefited greatly from being heated up to give the marshmallow that gooeyness one would expect from a campfire smore.

In addition to their cafe portion, they're also a regular chocolate shop with bars and other things for purchase (and sample!), and hold events and factory tours fairly frequently.

***Accessibility Info***

Venue - A huge space comprised of their chocolate factory, with limited regular seating towards the front, and bar counter seating along the "kitchen." The former is perfectly accessible, the latter, as expected, is not.

Bathroom - All the way towards the back, and also quite accessible.<//text>

< Review>
I saw this chocolate shop on the tv show Unique Sweets on the Cooking Channel last year, and since i was in the area dropped by. As soon as you walk in your smacked in the face with the smell of chocolate!! A great atmosphere with a great view of Valencia Street. I purchased the Nutella filled Chocolate Chip Cookies and the Dulce De Leche Bar. The Dulce De Leche bar is ridiculously good!! I definitely want to try the European Drinking Chocolate when I go back. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves chocolate.</Review>

Still delicious after 2 years later but be warned they sell out of those amazing s'mores so come early or end up disappointed like we were =(

However, it did prompt me to try their super rich hot chocolate which I am happy to report is chocolate bliss. It's rich, indulgent, creamy nirvana

7x7 100 Best Things To Eat In SF Before You Die 2014

#20 Papua New Guinea S'more at Dandelion Chocolate

Simply put, the best smore I have had so far. The marshmallow had just the right amount of sweetness and texture. I loved that it was firm yet had such a soft cloudy mouth feel. It was paired with just the right balance of chocolate to graham cracker ratio. The touch of salt is what brought the entire dish together and would gladly go back for another.

I also decided to try the "Frozen" Hot Chocolate and Nutella Chocolate Chip Cookie. I can safely say I won't be back for those. The hot chocolate felt extremely watered down in both texture and flavor.

Overall Thoughts

I will be back for a S'more, you can count on that!<//Text>

<Text>Tried a couple of times to get an espresso here, BIG mistake!  It's bitter and burnt no matter how many times they try to make it.  Worst, they argue that that's how it's supposed to be.
Stick to chocolate drinks if you go here.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x808f7e3d23f5dddd:0x3342559449ab0793< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>(Translated by Google) The inside of the shop is filled with the scent of chocolate, creating a happy space 🥰
I had hot chocolate and canelé in the photo. I think this plate is heath ceramic, but it is a plate made by Japanese people.

There is also a workshop where you can observe the process of making chocolate. The location of the shop is a little far from the center of San Francisco, so it's safer to go by car. I also went with Uber.

There were few tourists and it seemed that the locals were coming.
We have stores in San Francisco and Japan, so you can buy them in Japan and order them online!
If you miss Dandelion, you'll be surprised 😊

(Original)
お店の中はチョコレートの香りが立ち込めて、幸せな空間が広がっています🥰
写真のホットチョコレートとカヌレを頂きました。こちらのお皿は、ヒースセラミックかと思いきや、日本人の方が作られたお皿です。

工房が併設されており、チョコレートが作られる過程が見学できます。お店の場所は、サンフランシスコの中心部から少し離れた場所なので車で行った方が無難です。私もUberで行きました。

観光客少なく、地元の方が来ている様子でした。
サンフランシスコと日本に店舗があるので、日本でも購入でき、通販でお取り寄せも可能です！

<text>(Translated by Google) You can try a variety of chocolates, and there is also 100% cacao chocolate. Because it operates like a cafe, you can taste delicious cocoa and sell good products for gifts. The store is small but well decorated, and the chocolate price is a little expensive.

<review>(Translated by Google) Truly indescribable! It is quite an experience. While the chocolates could be from more destinations (offering a little more variety) and different hues for different palates, the place offers a quality of coffee and desserts that can hardly be beat. The trio of cupcakes was amazing! Maybe too sweet (and I'm super sweet), but they were still delicious! And the spicy chocolate coffee was to die for! You have to be prepared because when it says “spicy” it is because it is “really spicy”. But I liked it a lot! It's nice to see how they prepare the chocolates in the back. They also apparently run workshops. It would be necessary to be aware.

(Original)
Realmente indescriptible! Es toda una experiencia. Si bien los chocolates podrían ser de más destinos (ofreciendo un poco más de variedad) y de tonalidades distintas para paladares diferentes, el lugar ofrece una calidad de cafés y postres que difícilmente se puede superar. El trío de cupcakes fue alucinante! Quizá demasiado dulce (y eso que yo soy súper dulcera), pero igual estuvieron deliciosos! Y el café con chocolate picante estuvo de muerte! Hay que ir preparados porque cuando dice “spicy” es porque es “really spicy”. Pero me gustó mucho! Es bonito ver cómo preparan los chocolates en l parte de atrás. Al parecer también dictan talleres. Habría que estar al tanto.< /review>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) A paradise for chocolatiers. It costs a lot to decide between the delights that they prepare and everything enters through the eyes. In the mouth they do not disappoint, they are equally delicious. I tried a kind of coulant that I still remember and that was wonderful!

Un paraíso para los chocolateros. Cuesta mucho decidirse entre las delicias que preparan y todo entra por los ojos. En boca no decepcionan, están igualmente buenísimas. Yo probé una especie de coulant que todavía recuerdo y que era maravilloso!< /text>

(Translated by Google) I came to visit a chocolate factory. Despite the 70% cacao content, the taste was not too heavy and was delicious. It is a popular shop with a cafe.
I wish I could have visited more slowly, but I didn't even have time to drink coffee because I came to the event (´Д⊂

チョコレート工場見学で来ました。70%代のカカオ含有量なのにあまり味は重すぎず美味しかったです。カフェ併設で人気のお店です。

(Translated by Google) Surprise the different varieties of chocolate produced in this artisan factory. The flavor varies greatly by the origin of the cocoa beans. You can visit the factory and there is a small cafe on the premises. Highly recommended to visit and try chocolate.
