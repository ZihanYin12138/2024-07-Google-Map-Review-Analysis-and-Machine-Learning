<Pictures>None</Pictures><text>It's a bit pricey but it gets the job done so incredibly quickly. I normal wait 45 min for a wash where I live, but these were much faster. Downside is the dryers I used weren't so great and required 5 times to dry, .48 per min. Otherwise, good place for large loads of laundry.</text>< Rate>

WIFI and MOVIES. I would recommend to anyone to come and do your laundry here. It's hard to do luandry, especially when you have a family, but coming here has made is easier.The building is massive and there are more than enough machines for all. Even when busy, there are always machines available. They have Wednesday and Thursday, 1 cent a minute dryers, and if you add 20 dollars they give you 22 instead. Honeslty, I would never switch, because the staff makes me wanna come back everytime, especially Alejandra, best employee here</Text>

<Review>I was absolutely uncomfortable there I have been going to the same place for years n have never felt so disgusted or seen the place like that. Place was a mess, trash all over the floors!.... 2 guys in the laundry mat with no face covering or shield. I ask the young lady (irene)working there if that was allowed n she just shrugged her shoulders n said they have Drs note! That's not a excuse to allow them in especially now in days!<//Review>< pics>

The staff here is amazing. Always willing to help, always keeping the whole building clean. I've had excellent experience when it comes to customer service! Also once have I ever had an issue with one of the machines, but they were right there to help resolve and issue a refund on. But they were amazing! Laundry mat is always clean, I've never once seen a dirty machine. I've been going here every weekend for over a year. And don't forget the deals and the perks! Definelty recommend!</Review>

Kind of pricey but it is cleaned daily and they run ceiling fans and AC when needed so I stopped going to the sweat shop laundromats. Most employees are friendly and helpful (there's always one or two in every bunch that aren't) the TV's usually have something decently entertaining on if you like to watch it.
They do have dryer specials what I don't like is people come out if the bush that have not washed their clothes there with 7-10 loads right as my laundry is just about to come out of the washer and they take up 7-10 dryers to take advantage of the dryer special. That is not right or fair to loyal customers that do both wash and dry there. I am a twice a week customer that does not even try to come on those days because of the rude dryer hog people that get away with doing that. This happens at all Grande locations and no one says a word to the dryer takeover people.  I just go elsewhere if I need to do my laundry on their dryer special days.This is why I'm rating 4* I was thinking of giving 3* because it pisses me off.<//text>

This laundry is very nice and calm, it sounds weird but I love that I can go at anytime and not have to worry about a big crowd. Staff is super nice always helpful and respectful.  I haven't had a problem with the washers or dryers yet, but there's always an attendant there to help and guide us through the card system, so that makes me feel very secure and happy to have someone available to help.<//Review>

This Laundry will forever be my favorite. Not only are the employees really welcoming but it's always clean, there's a bunch of laundry carts, and plenty of Folding tables. I just like the way this laundry is set up. I use The Handicap parking so I find it convenient that the parking is right In front of the laundry. I am beyond thankful for the great customer service provided by the attedants.<//review>

Other than having my towels stolen once, it's a good place. I just know now never to leave my stuff there. I put my stuff in the dryer and ran an errand and when I got done,  I realized my towels we're missing.  What are you gonna do. I know better now.</text>

<Text>I've been there about once a week at varying times for the past eighteen months. It's big, bright, and always clean. Safe, friendly atmosphere. I like the staff. I've never had to wait for a washer, dryer, or a table to fold. I avoid Thursdays though, as they have a special on dryers and it tends to be crowded.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Ive been doing my laundry here for years. I love the washers, the friendly enviroment, I feel safe bringing my grandkids to do laundry with me because they have a gated playground. 1 cent dry every thursday, and free coffee every morning! I highly recommend this location.</text>

Little by Little is a true hidden gem at the Warm Springs district in Fremont, CA, close to where T4 is. They are tucked away in the corner of the shopping center and this place serves really delicious food! They currently only do to go orders only and all the staff members do their very best to maintain covid safety procedures. They do fusions of every cuisines and serve from pastas, sandwiches, rice plates, and sides. I really enjoyed their food so much that I 100% truly recommend the most! I got to try their vegetarian options which were the roasted garlic cauliflower truffle Mac and cheese, the rainbow salad, and mushroom coconut pesto curry.

I will review the roasted garlic cauliflower truffle Mac and cheese first! It was absolutely my favorite dish on the menu! The presentation of the Mac and cheese was beautiful with the breadcrumbs on top and the chives to give it a nice color. Literally I haven’t had Mac and cheese in so long and this brings back many memories but I liked this version MUCH BETTER! I love the addition of the truffle oil because I think it gave a nice fattiness to the dish but it wasn’t drenched in oil which that’s a good thing. The breadcrumbs gave the Mac and cheese great texture and I love the dish having some garlic as well. I actually do wish that the Mac and cheese was cheesier because Mac and cheese is supposed to be a cheesy dish and for me, I personally wanted more cheese not only to make a viral tik tok video but taste wise, I would have liked and tasted more cheese. I also didn’t see a lot of cauliflower unless it was cut up small which I appreciate so you don’t get huge chunks but I didn’t  taste cauliflower. Overall, my favorite dish on the menu hands down, I really recommend the Mac and cheese!

The rainbow salad is basically kale, baby spinach, red quinoa, cherry tomatoes, red cabbage, roasted white corn, crispy quinoa, with yuzu aioli, and gribiche sauce on the side. This was truly a rainbow salad! I saw a lot of color and the presentation of the salad was beautifully done! You get the freshness of the kale, spinach and love all the vegetables and fruits in the salad as well! The nuttiness of the quinoa was delicious which added a nice flavor aspect to the salad. On the dressing, I’m questioning why I got two dressings because normally  we would only see one dressing so the dressings don’t clash. I wish I only got one dressing instead of two different dressings but both of them tasted about the same in terms of flavor. If I were to choose, I feel like the yuzu aioli was better in terms of flavor and thickness. I thought the gribiche sauce was too thick for me but the yuzu aioli felt lighter; still a but thick but tasted better in my opinion.

The mushroom coconut pesto curry has button mushrooms, red quinoas, cauliflower, corn, and garlic rice. I loved the flavor of the coconut curry. I thought it was creamy, smooth, light, and it was mild. I also love the addition to the quinoa because that added flavor and texture. The mushrooms, I love too and that is like a substitute for meat so the seasoning was on point and definitely was fulling to eat. With the cauliflower, again I didn’t get a lot of cauliflower. I wish there was more and I wish the rice had more garlic because I didn’t get a lot of garlic. Overall, I’m super satisfied with this curry and loved all the elements of the curry!

Overall, Little by Little in Fremont is a true hidden gem in Fremont! I really recommend it and please support this business! They have put a lot of heart and soul to the food and the chef was great in putting everything together to make the dish perfect!<//Text>

<text>What a hidden gem in Warm Springs. I have passed by this place for so many times without notice it.

We decided to give it a try on a beautiful weekend. Small restaurant but completely filled up on Saturday noon.

The food here is so delicious and the drinks are cute too.

Order:
Roast Bone Marrow: Personally I love the bone marrow a lot, and the sauce on the side is phenomenal.
Seared Scallops: the seared scallops are spot on, and love the creative side of shrimp chili oil.
Confit duck leg: Love the harmony of crispy duck skin and the tender duck meat!

Drinks:
Rose lemonade is delicious!

Thanks for the complimentary spiced popcorn and definitely come back next time to explore more options.< /text>< pics>

<text>2nd visit here. Tasty foods with good presentation. You can feel that each dish placed on the table is the result of a thoughtful process. They make their own pasta. It's delicious. Icecream cone on cold brewed coffee is hidden gem. The table next to us soon ordered it, too.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0i4ZiNOBePOz8-JCrb_y-sq3It766PLlifM9v=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Just had a birthday celebration here. Food is so fresh. Portions are a tad on the modest side. Great flavors and menu variety. Really appreciate that our teenagers and all adults we're satisfied with the offerings. Tad disappointed that there wasn't a full bar as advertised on their website. If you have more than two people I'd recommend making a reservation. Place has a good vibe, fun music and great service. Waiter was attentive and accomodations made for food allergies with confidence. HIGHLY recommend checking this place out!< /Text>

Great spot to grab a bite. Particularly loved the steak. Duck confit was almost fall off the bone! Tacos could use more sauce. Also noticed it's the same sauce for a couple dishes. Scallops were delicious. Would have preferred diff sauce for diff dishes... otherwise everything was really good!< /review>

<review>First time in and ordered the house salad, bolognese pasta, pork belly tacos and steak. Everything was delicious and my only critique was the bitter green peppers were used all dishes but the pasta. Their bitterness was not balanced well and were a bit overpowering for my taste. I tossed the flour tortillas from the tacos, and ate the contents over a bed of their side of rice. The rice was fluffy and cooked to perfection.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Super weird location but pleasantly surprised by the overall experience. All of the farm to table dishes were fantastic. This place has a great chef - that's for sure. The surprising dish was the chuck steak. By the looks of it, one would guess it was overcooked and dry - but really is tender and full of flavor. The pasta for the pappadelle taste like they hand made it; very fresh. Only complaint would be lighting was a tad bit on the bright side - I feel like they could do okay with being 30% less lumen.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808fc65b8df00001:0xc5005cf459a6b782</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Great  little restaurant just off Mission Blvd at Warm Springs. The chef owner puts a lot of thought and care into his menu and food. Fresh ingredients, excellent flavors,  great specialty cocktails, and good selection of tasty wine and beers. Short ribs are to die for, even the burger was tasty. Bone marrow, nachos and salad starters were also hits. Try it!<//Review>< Pics>

<text>PROS:
- Tasty food.

CONS:
- Super small portions.
- Pricey.

NOTES:
Maybe you're supposed to order multiple portions at this place? I went for lunch and was still hungry after one plate. For the price though, I'm not ordering more than one plate. I ended up visiting another restaurant after. LOL!<//text>< date>

Really good food here. The little neck clams along with the short ribs were my favorite dishes of the night. Nice decor and the service was good. It's a little hard to find at first. As you come into the plaza go to the left and make like you are going to go to the back of the marina plaza. It's the last one in that row.</Review>

<review>This is really a fusion tapas kind of place. Food is almost there, but maybe when I went it was chefs night off. The menu is inspiring, it is clean and reasonable, but the food was just not up to expectations. However, still worth a visit if you are looking  for somewhere in Fremont to dine..</review><Name>Nigel Holehouse</Name><Rate>3< /Rate><Gmap_id>0x808fc65b8df00001:0xc5005cf459a6b782<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It's about time Fremont gains a new restaurant with class.

The core cuisine is American & French tapas. The menu is subject to change and it's been suggested that foie gras might be served in the future.

The most notable items I had here was the bone marrow, short rib, and uni pasta.

The bone marrow is served with some bread and it's basically a pate. Very rich and flavorful, would be a great choice if you're looking for brunch.

The short rib's presentation is lovely, like a meadow encircled by a dark forest. The meat just falls apart with a slight push of the fork. The garnish adds a complexity to the meat's succulent texture and a small bite of the salad followed by the meat helps balance the flavors. It is by far my favorite dish as it is both a feast for the eyes and the mouth.

The uni pasta here is sure to convince anyone apprehensive of trying uni. The uni itself turns the dish practically into macaroni and cheese, but it doesn't have the smell or heaviness of cheese. The uni is light and custardy and goes great with the roe on top of the pasta. It almost tastes like a comfort food, but has the flavors of the sea incorporated into it. Definitely recommended.

Will come back soon to see how the menu evolves.<//Review>< date>

I came here for date night on a Friday evening without a reservation. I've learned that I should make a reservation next time in order to secure one of the few tables.

I ended up sitting by the bar which is not bad in any way as you get a good view on the kitchen and can see how everything is being prepared. I observed how the chef takes great pride in finishing off every dish before he sends it out and is focused on quality and a consistent experience.

Having that said, the dishes do look pretty and very presentable. I tried 4 dishes, plus desert and every dish was worth a photo. The first one I had was the Octopus dish. It's supposed to be a shareable dish, but the portion is still rather small and you only get a few bites of Octopus. All of that is fine in general, the issue is the prize. You pay over $20 for that dish and if you want to feed two people well, you need to order at least three more dishes - if not even four more. This means you will end up paying between $100-170 including drinks. I am ok to pay this kind of money for a nice dinner, but I expect the right service and taste then. Let me elaborate on this.

All dishes I had tasted solid, but there was nothing that really blew me away. Some dishes, like the Risotto are a great idea, but the flavor is not yet there where it needs to be. It felt too salty to me and too soft. I think it's a matter of time and the chef will turn this into a great dish.

Similar with the bone marrow. It's something that you don't eat every day and it was certainly well cooked. But it was missing that certain something that makes me want to end up spending so much money on it. For example, it comes with basic toast which feels just very boring.

The short ribs were solid as well, but not tender and juicy enough for the prize.

Again, there's nothing wrong with the food, but I think the chef just needs some time to refine and work on the recipes to justify the high charge.

The service was so-so. I've ordered a glass of the Cabernet from Passo Robles. One of my favorite wine regions and the red did not disappoint. But: they charge $12 a glass which is somewhat standard in the Bay area, but I never got poured less wine in a glass than here. It almost felt I get more wine when I go to a wine tasting. When I tried to bring this up with the waiter in a friendly and funny way and told him that I love this wine, he just mentioned he would let the chef know. I also asked if the Yelp check-in for 50% off cocktails would apply to wine, because I would take another glass if it would - he said no. I had two sips of the wine and the glass was empty. When I paid and was ready to leave, the waiter offered me another glass on the house - very wrong timing.

Overall the service was very friendly though and I ended up leaving a nice tip.

The place itself feels upscale, modern and cool. It could almost be in L.A. I feel it has huge potential but requires some serious work on the food, the prizes and the wine.</review>

Shannon and the guys at this place are awesome!  I needed an alignment done as soon as possible as I had just had some new tires installed.  They were able to squeeze me in to their schedule. Took only an hour. Awesome customer service, will definitely be back! Super transparent about pricing and they walk you through the work being done beforehand.<//text>

< review>
We've been going to this service garage for nearly 5 years.  Each time we get great service, and a call before any repairs are made.  We take both our car and truck to this garage regularly.

I highly recommend Oakdale Garage, Inc.

Of those 5 years, there has only been one time that we have not had our vehicle back within a couple of hours.

Great service and prices in my opinion.

Which is fine, if you can fix it just say I cant fix it. Dont take my car for the day and charge me.
When I asked what I payed for I was told, "I dont know anything about this car, Im learning. So I charged you for resarch."
So this guy basically got a lesson and some work experience on my dime. I still have to take my car to get fixed.</Text>< Response>

This place is a joke. Horrible place to “try” and get your car smogged. They refused me and my car because they said they close in one hour. ( you can’t smog a car in an hour, ok ) Then they say because my car is 1994 that they don’t feel like doing it. What kind of business you running picking and choosing what customers you want to take. Whatever, I’ll just go to American Smog in Oakdale instead but thanks for not letting me waste my money on you guys.</text>

It doesn't sound like we were in a position to offer you the best service with only an hour until closing, so instead we wanted to make sure you still had the car available rather than keep it overnight for a routine smog inspection.

This was my second visit to the Oakdale Garage.  Both times I have found them to be open and honest.  They did not try to sell me services that I did not need nor want.  Their work was satisfactory, the cost reasonable, and I will return for additional work as needed.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>Pricy service. Paid $80 to smog my car and it didn't pass. Got an estimate immediately after for $400 to help it pass. Had to ask them to just give me the smog fee. Good place to take your 2018 Ford and throw money at someone in a uniform who will laugh at your jokes. Bad place to take an older car.<//Text>< Pics>

I was travelling alone and out of country and was afraid to drive into the park and have the car break down in the middle of nowhere.  The guys at Oakdale helped me immediately, even though the day was almost done for them.  They knew I was just passing through town and needed help quickly.  I was having a bad day on many levels, and the last thing I needed was car trouble in an unfamiliar place, but Tommy and Carey were so kind and helpful that I knew everything would be okay.

<Text>I totally got ripped off.
Don't bring a European car.
They did a job for me, didn't filter the oil when they took it out and it completely ruined my engine.  The oil leak was fixed for 2k and they told me they didn't ruin my car so they wouldn't cover the engine.  Horrible salesmanship, horrible service.  I hope a better business replaces them soon</Text>< name>

Our car was there for a week but we were out of town so it didn't matter. We got into town and they fixed everything. They told us they tested it and made sure our car wasn't going to act up. They gave us a warranty that works for any garage. We went out and they had also cleaned the interior. Let me tell ya it was SOOO dirty before ( I had planned on cleaning it before we left but didn't get to it) and they thuroughly vacuumed and cleaned the inside. No more dusty and crumbs anywhere.

< review>
So here we are, and it's renewal time.  I received many, I mean many phone calls from TT.  Now keep in mind our nation shut down and was not able to travel, but I maintain paying my bill.  Time to renew,  and finally getting to speak with a human I'm told this.  In order to get the 3 months, you will need to pay another annual fee.  TT, how about this, instead of your customers coming out to the pocket to pay $300 dollars, why don't you offer a deal since we Americans were not able to travel (unless you are rich).  I feel that you are not taking into consider the working middle class folks that maintain their accounts in spite of what we Americans (TT members had to experience not being able to travel).  I want to travel, but I didn't want to take the chance and find myself dead. I am asking that you take my situation into consideration, and provide me with a discount for the renewal and the three months for free.  If you truly appreciate your customers that should be real easy.  So what do you say?</review>

<Gmap_id>0x80dc72e5b25eaaab:0x2a6adb09c97fe8c5</Gmap_id><name>Marc Rut< /name><text>I was called from a local phone number and the person identified herself from United Airlines.
I was lured into their grand opening for their new travel center and I would receive as a gift 2 airlines tickets plus hotel stay, completely free.
I was transferred to their manager to confirm their requirements, then another person called me to receive a confirmation code and offered me a complementary $100 dining card.
Here is the FRAUD/SCAM: They are travel transparency club preview center, they have been open for years... you have to endure a long presentation on their travel platform and pushed to buy a membership for $10K (it will go down if you say no) plus annual fees. Back at home I did compare the prices shown on their PPT presentation with priceline, tripmasters, TripAdvisor.... and they are soooooo overpriced.
The free airlines tickets.... comes with unreasonable conditions, including a $250 taxes and fees per person and mailing a $100 and $75 cashiers check;  is almost impossible to book.
The $100 dining card are coupons, several coupons

Regardless that I asked to each person if they were calling from United Airlines or it was a third party administrator or a marketing company; they all answered they were from the new Travel Center in Oceanside from United airlines.

It is misleading, fraudulent, abusive and absolutely wrong their tactics to attract new “clients” to SCAM  and they are 100% responsible for their marketing

About the 5 Star reviews.... they will offer more “free incentives” if you leave a 5 star review....<//text><userid>107817145888631887836< /userid><Date>1593675244799< /Date>< Pics>

<Text>My experience with this website was great! I’ve used it multiple times and my stays at the hotels on the website were all pleasant, and they were even at a reasonable price. The website was also user friendly so it was easy for me to find the right hotel for my budget. All the hotels were managed well, clean, and had good customer service. I am looking forward to my next vacation!</Text><Response>{'time': 1563641772691, 'text': "Thank you Wendy.  So happy you're enjoying the program!"}<//Response>< gmap_id>

This place is a total scam. I was contacted by a marketing company who offered me 3 days, 2 nights hotel stay at anywhere in the continental united states as well as 2 free airline tickets to anywhere in the continental united states to listen to a 90 minute presentation with no obligation to buy anything. They said it was a grand opening for a travel agency.

The sales person was nice. We listened to the presentation and felt pressured to finance a membership (which we didn't do). It was NOT a grand opening (they had been open over a year). They gave us a gift receipt with MANY conditions; including, only traveling on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday to a limited number of cities. And guess what...it wasnt free! It was $199 per person plus a $50 processing fee. $450 of free!

They were taking advantage of many retirees as well. The prices for what they were offering kept moving with the conversation. So annoying.< /text>

Going to Disneyland and staying for two nights was easy with my Travel Transparency  membership. Staying at the Hilton two blocks from Disney Village  was wonderful. Saving $270.00 on that hotel stay Palm Sunday was AWESOME.  I love the fact that I do not have compromise on quality because of affordability or dates. I go when I want, and all at wholesale prices. European  River Cruise here I come.<//Text>

<text>Hi highly recommend that you work with a US based or local telemarketing service if you must use one. Nowadays with all the scams going around people are concern and lack trust about any free offer. Since you are a local business you should have no problem connecting with the community in much more trustworthy  manner.
Best of luck.<//text>< pictures>

The marketing company that called me said they were "Southwest Airlines" and that I would receive two round trip tickets for free plus 3 days 2 nights hotel stay to listen to their presentation. Come to find out the tickets are not free and can only be used on a Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays and you have to return in two days. You leave after 3pm and have to return the morning of the 3rd day, so where ever you go you would only have one full day at your destination. No thanks!

The timeshare seems like a good value, just wish they didn't use lying marketing companies to get you in the door. Travel Transparency should also give you what was promised for viewing the presentation. I was also promised upon arrival dining coupons, which I did not receive. Just the fact that they don't deliver what they promise makes me question this company's ethics. I was going to research another travel company and compare but not anymore. If you can't be up front and honest with your initial promises you're not the type of company I want to do business with.< /Review>

<Review>This company made it easy to come in, listen to their pitch and make an informed decision. After weighing everything out and considering the fact that I want to travel with my family at least once a year, it became a no brainer. If you travel, or even plan to, it’s certainly worth checking out. The best part was the rep didn’t pressure the decision, they presented the facts and we acted!<//Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1554646190923, 'text': 'Thank you Phillip!

Got a call to listen to a presentation on a wholesale travel membership.  The 3 day 2 night weekend will be nice as we will go to Nashville for the first time. Btw this is a separate promotional company.

The bonus is we signed up and our family will be able to enjoy the member benefits for life!  $50/night for some very nice resorts in Cabo, Vegas, or many places in the world is an example.  Cruises at 25-50% less than lowest listed price as well.  Many other member benefits as well. I’d recommend going in and listening to what these folks have to offer.  No high pressure sales at all.  If you like what they have to offer sign up. If not, follow the steps for your promotional weekend away including hotel and airfare for a few hundred bucks.  We will be booking our first cruise soon!

Robbie, Lisa, et al are very knowledgeable friendly with many years of travel industry experience between them!

I’d recommend sitting down and listening to what these folks have to offer.

Leif and Robbie were really nice and cute and they answered all of our questions and worked with us until we created a plan that worked for us. They made the experience fun but even if they weren’t fun and cute, we would have purchased anyway because this service is absolutely worth it - hands down - if you travel, or even if you just want to travel, you need this service!!! It is worth it at any price!!!<//Review>

Excellent Vacation Program that is NOT your typical Timeshare program.  No maintenance fees involved. You have access to exclusive Wholesale travel prices 24/7.  Program pays for itself!! Wish I knew about this company before I bought my Timesheet!!</Review>

My family are looking forward to many future vacations. Thanks alot to the staff at Travel Transparency.< /text>< Pics>

<time>1548881486289</time><review>So you go view a timeshare presentation to get your “free trip”. Your “free trip” will cost you $75 per person  at least to stay in a Motel 6 in your chosen destination. And I will take a heckuva lot of work on your part navigating the restrictions to finally try and make any reservations. The “open house with a 20 minute video” that was mentioned in the phone call is actually: 30 mins of an appointment with a “host” and painfully awkward small talk (where they’re trying to pull information out of you to see if you can afford their program essentially), a preview of their website, and a 45 minute PowerPoint presentation on timeshares, and will end with a hard, hard sell. They will try to sell you a “new and improved timeshare option“  for thousands of dollars where you don’t really own anything, but you’re basically buying access to cheaper prices, and more flexibility - the ability to use their proprietary system to still then buy discounted, wholesale priced travel rooms/activities. Yes, you will save money. And instead of 90 minutes where whatever they promised you, it’ll probably take at least three hours and they will keep going back-and-forth trying to sell it to you even though you said no 50 different ways.  However, if you do keep saying they’ll they’ll reduce the price from $8000 to $1000. It’s a big joke and a massive waste of time.< /review>< resp>

We listened to their sales pitch and decided against handing over $8,000. I was not comfortable with making an on the spot financial commitment. Glad I did not, too. Afterwards I learned that their gift incentives were highly misleading. They promised a $100 dining gift card and 2 free airline tickets to any CONUS destination. The dining card turned out to be a bunch of discount coupons and the airline tickets require you to register by mail and send a $100 cashier's check. Makes you question the integrity of this business.<//Review>

<Review>Travel Transparency in itself is a cool business idea. They do require an up-front cost, ranging from $3k - $10k, to basically give you membership and access to discounted hotels, time shares, houses etc. . . Sometimes the price for a full week (for a hotel or time share) is around $200. This is an insanely good deal.

There's a yearly fee of $150, and if there wasn't a $3k initial investment my wife and I would have jumped on it. This private membership does offer some great prices on vacations. So the initial investment ($3k - $10k) could make A LOT of sense, and save you a lot of money if you're going to travel a good amount.

My issue is mostly with their marketing company. They got my wife and I to show up. So kudos to that. They did their job. But we asked several times about the details of the "round trip airfare". We were told we won free tickets from Delta and could fly anywhere in the continental US. We asked about restrictions and the marketing company said we would receive an email with all details. The email we got just further highlighted that we would get 2 round trip tickets and 2 nights in a hotel! Sounds great right? **Terms and conditions apply** But they do charge $75/person in gov't fees and $75/person in a "reservation fee". We thought, "ok, if we can fly from San Diego to New York for $150/person, that's still pretty good". Because of this, we went through the presentation, which was well done. Very nice people. No complaints in the presentation. I just wish they would have told us about the flight restrictions up front.

After the presentation we get our "voucher" for the plane tickets:

**Valid for Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday Departure dates only**
**you are required to send $100 cashiers check to CasablancaExpress to request your travel dates**
** The $100 cashiers check is refundable 30 days AFTER you complete your travel**
**After Casablanca gets your $100 cashiers check. They send you a reservation letter that you must complete with your requested departure dates. You must send this back with $75/person reservation fee**
**You must provide THREE different departure dates at least 60 days in advance of your first date and 30 days between subsequent dates**
**You must provide at least one alternate destination**
**All reservations are subject to availability**

These last few qualifications makes planning a trip really hard. This makes me assume that CasablancaExpress (who you're sending $100 to, then $75/person to) gets to pick any of the 3 dates (within a 3 month range) that you provided, and either to your preferred destination OR the backup destination?? I'm assuming they will just pick the worst/cheapest date, and the cheaper destination.

Departing flights are between 3-10 and return flights are between 6am - 1.

Your tickets will be mailed at least 10 days prior to your arrival date. . .

All of this would have been good to know BEFORE agreeing to the meeting. This is what should have been provided in the email. I understand that Travel Transparency can kinda blame this on "their marketing companies" But if they don't know what their marketing companies are telling their future customers, theres a little bit of blame on Travel Transparency for that. . .

For a company called travel TRANSPARENCY, this was not a good start to doing business with them.

The flight/hotel deal has wayyy too many *send me money first by mail cashiers check* *send me more money by mail with 3 different dates that they get to choose* -- WAY TOO COMPLICATED for a company who is trying to make travel easier by just going online and booking a vacation. I feel like their promotion should be in-line with their business model. Not something that will be extremely hard to plan around (what am I suppose to ask my boss for 3 different travel dates for 3 subsequent months and be like "yeah boss sorry, I'm going on a vacation, but i dont know when yet, can i get march 3-7, april 3-7 and May 3-7 off please?".)

I wish the business success because I like the business model. They need to change their marketing plan<//Review></record>

Acres of plants and plenty of people to help you. Went in to a few things they were very efficient and answers were clear , to the point and very informative. Very happy. Only complaint would be parking is  limited but there is parking across the street, so no big deal just a few extra steps.<//Text>

<review>Their service was horrible to say the least. We tried to call the owner  many times direct with no return calls and called his office many times to have them do a design for our backyard. We went and visited today to pick out the plants ourselves and do the design. The owner was so rude to us and called us liars to our face. He did not want our business nor did his employees. He did not want our business by any means. I still am in shock.  I would recommend nobody to go there and will be telling people who ask me about my experience the same. Very disappointed.</review><time>1590081028744<//time>< user_id>

<Text>Paradise Garden Center is just now finishing up my landscaping, as we removed grass and put in plants and a drip system so I have been working with them for several weeks.  They have several employees at the nursery who really know their plants, and are very helpful whether you are just there for a few things for your yard, or are ready for a total redo.  I'm also very impressed with their crew who are quick and efficient.

I can't say enough nice things about Christian, the owner.  He is a problem solver, excellent listener and gave me the garden and yard I wanted.  Thanks, Christian!<//Text><Response>None<//Response>< Pictures>

<text>Hard working staff, they help you with choosing the right stuff for your garden projects. large yard lots different large trees, shrubs, succulents,roses , ground cover plants,vines , fruits,rocks,multch, soils etc ... Plenty more stuff and they also deliver if you wanna get alot of material, although a pick-up truck is fine since it's open to the public . They got machinery to load up trees so it's no problem if you wanna take a decent size tree.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rate>2<//Rate><text>These guys are a wreck. I called looking for a specific tree, which they reported to have. I drove across town to buy it, and was told that, no, the tree I wanted was at their other location on La Sierra, about a mile from where I was when I had called.

So I opened up Google Maps to look for the location on La Sierra, but it doesn't exist on the map. So I went back in to get directions/ address, and they pulled out a handy, pre-printed, laminated map to look at, which they easily could have given me at first. After studying the map, I observed that the La Sierra location is not in fact on La Sierra, but is instead on Campbell. Which they didn't tell me.

So I programmed in the address, and crossed town again, only to find a locked gate and no one around. The place looked closed. After wandering around for 20 minutes, and figuring out that the gate was not actually locked, I found a worker, who informed me that the tree I wanted was at ANOTHER location over off of a different street (Norwood). So I followed him on a quarter-mile walk to the other site, where he escorted me to the tree I had requested... only to find that it was a DWARF version of the tree. They had no standard-size trees in the variety that I had requested.

So after driving across town twice, and wasting 2 hours trying to get what I wanted, they didn't have the thing they told me that they had.

The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because the worker who helped me locate the (wrong) tree was helpful and sympathetic, noting that the guys at the Dufferin location often misstate their stock, don't verify availability, and don't give clear directions to customers. So while it didn't help me at all, at least he understood my situation.

This could all have been avoided with some very minimal customer service effort on their part, saving me hours of wasted time, and a lot of driving. But they don't seem to really care about their customers, so I won't be back. I recommend to you that if you want something from them, be very specific with them about exactly what it is that you want, and make sure you ask where you should expect to find it. Otherwise you may end up on the same wild goose chase that I experienced.

Consider yourself warned.</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb0135194d9db:0x517a96a3a4e7d666</Gmap_id></record>

One of the best Training Schools around.  Courses are interactive and not death by PowerPoint. The instructors are over qualified.  I choose to drive over one hour on the road without traffic to attend there. I love my time there. The knowledge I received make me feel confident going into my future career.</text>

I was asked to come to an in person instructed class for a certification to carry a baton. I was treated with extreme misogyny as a woman an felt afraid I was threaten with the police so I could be escorted by some means for some reason. I did not appreciate being treated like that. With all the “power” Held by this business it was not cool. I hope someone reading this understands where I’m coming from because I ain’t bout that life & if I could I’d give them nun starts</review>

J.P & Gunny’s experience together makes the class, explosive ,exciting, and very informative. This agency is professional and the raw reality of what you encounter in the security profession armed or unarmed. It also gives you knowledge if you ever want to purse Law Enforcement. You have to have the knowledge they give you , quick reaction and thick skin!!! I’m not exaggerating, truly worth the money spent !!</review>

<Review>If I had to submit a one-sentence review of the Security & Firearms Training Academy (SAFTA) located at 3355 Myrtle Avenue #200 North Highlands, CA 95660then it would be:

During our 80-hour Advanced Security Officer Course, the staff at SAFTA provided quality hands-on training and relevant academic instruction that sets up graduates for success as a security guard professional.

In addition to my one sentence review of SAFTA, I would like to also say that SAFTA is staffed with security guard professionals that care about instilling pride and standards in the security guard profession.  SAFTA training stressed the importance of proper application of escalation of force.  SAFTA instructors focused on teaching the bedrock fundamentals and skills that are needed for working as a security guard.  Trainers focused steadfastly on safety during the firearms and baton training and certification.  I highly advise that people interested in becoming a security guard take courses of instruction from SAFTA.

A special note on two integral members of SAFTA:

Ed “Gunny” Caballero is the subject matter expert who taught our class and his teaching style may be gruff like a drill sergeant at military basic training, but it was comfortably familiar and I think necessary.  Why?  Because the split second decisions that a security guard might have to make could be the difference between life and death and between criminal and civil courts of justice.  The class needed to have a strong foundation of knowledge and training related to penal codes and proper use of force.  Gunny provided us that expert instruction.

Sherryann is the mother that all of us wished were our own.  I cannot think of a more beautiful woman or soul.  She cares not only about taking care of her SAFTA co-workers but she also provided all the touches of home in ensuring that the students of the Advanced Security Officer Course were pampered and taken care of during our hours of instruction.  She is truly a special lady.< /Review><Time>1574903633487< /Time><UserId.>103365423924804740183< /UserId.>< pictures>

This class was very informative and easy to understand. The class instructor Steve "gunny" Caballero was very thorough and precise with all the information needed to successfully pass this course. I recommend anyone who wants to obtain their guard card to go through this training facility.<//Text>

I took both guard and the gun training.
Thanks to the staff because they really set themselves apart from the rest of the pool of schools to choose from ..
Patrick was awesome and made me proud to be American again for the simple fact he is a veteran. I lost my brother in Iraq and my family will never be the same  His training is the best because he cares for everyone he teaches and offers himself no matter what time it is to help another veteran..
The rest of the staff including the owner work to help you get your card and gun permit to get you working ASAP ...
And that a fact to i believe i went to the best school...... Thanks again to the school i can't really say enough about the school....< /review>

The staff is amazing very professional and helpful in every aspect of my Security Career. The Academy has such a home feeling, that its comforting. I felt at eased and confident that i am going to succeed after i finish with all my certifications and training.</text>

Let me tell you this, I came here on accident. It was the best mistake I’ve ever made. SAFTA is a great place to come if you’re trying to get your guard card. JC is very helpful. Also Diana is a wonderful woman she’s always smiling and will put a smile on your face.   Their location is very clean and it’s fun to learn here. They will help you a lot- highly recommend this. Goodluck.</Review>

SAFTA northlands is the best place for security and firearms training. The instructors are filled with endless experience and knowledge. They are very professional at what they do and how they teach the program. The front desk was also very helpful and knowledgeable on the content at hand. By far worth the time and money to get certifications. Quality over quantity the best in Sacramento.< /Review>

<text>I can't say enough good things about this training academy. I signed up for the 40 hour, level 1-3, training course not knowing what to expect and was amazed by how passionate the instructors were about making sure I understood my role as a security officer, the laws that I will most likely encounter, how to interact with law enforcement and the career paths available to me in the security guard industry.  After the completion of the course the staff took the time to help me navigate the BSIS online website to complete my guard card application.  I was so impressed by the initial training that I signed up to complete the security officer firearms training course to further my credentials.<//text>< userid>

I came to SAFTA to complete my 40 hours training and receive my guard card and I could not be happier with my decision. These guys (and gals) have a breadth of knowledge that is unrivaled anywhere else I looked and I picked up so much from them that it was worth every single penny. The fact that I am invited back anytime free of charge to brush up on handcuffing or any other training is just icing on the cake. All of the instructors were professional, knowledgeable, and courteous but a special shout out to the operations manager Monet and the instructor Pat for going above and beyond in making sure I was as qualified and confident as can be when I walked out the door. Great business and I will be coming back for my firearm certification and further training.<//text>

I used this school to add a caliber to my exposed firearms permit. I was more than pleased with the process and found everyone on the staff very professional. They were accommodating and made me, as well as the other students, feel relaxed and calm. I will recommend this school to other guards. Job well done!< /Review>

<text>The personnel at Safta are extremely knowledgeable and experienced. They take the time to ensure that the students absorb and understand all material being presented before moving on to the next subject. It is up to you as the student whether or not to fully comprehend the material. JC provides extraordinary service to assist you with any and all applications and services that you, as a future security guard, will need to fulfill. I truly thank everyone there for helping me along the path to a better career. I definitely recommend others to utilize this company for security guard training. Professionalism and intelligence.</text>< name>

I took my 16 hour CCW course here and I am glad that I did. When I was shopping around for a course, this place compared to others was cheaper. But that is not the only good thing about this place. This class was very informational and was taught by a very experienced instructor: Steve Caballero, ED.D. This guys is a retired Marine who has plenty of experience with working as law enforcement. He takes his job very seriously because he knows he was given the responsibility to train civilians to have a concealed carry licensed. He teaches you when is a right time to draw you weapon and teaches you all the steps that you need to consider before drawing your weapon. And he stated that within the 40 years of working in law enforcement, he only had to draw his weapon twice and had to shoot it only once. So he knows the importance of when it is a right time to draw you weapon. He is very stern but only because he wants to assure that we are all being safe. JC who deals with all the paper work is a nice lady and has awesome customer service. This course is very informational and I recommend this to anyone who has to take the 16 hour course or renewal. I will be back in two years to renew. Thank you SAFTA!< /Text>

<Review>Hello Tim gilroy again  I made this Google account so I don’t have to  disclose my actual name .  I actually did attend the 14 hour fire arm permit training.  Just because I didn’t list my actual name for everyone to see on here does it mean that my experiences are not true .
.  You have to remember that sometimes people don’t actually want to put their full name on Google reviews .  One of the main reasons is because I actually have to come back there to get handcuffed permit and  my baton permit . This is the only school in Sacramento  at least that I know of . So regardless of how rude your staff is or if they just are allowed to be  rude. I still must attend the school to progress in life and further my security education to get more permits to be paid more.  I am 100% a student who attended this school and I passed my fire arm  permit training .  Even though STEVE CABALLERO .  His assistant was calling him Gunie was Is very rude.  I am being 100% serious that that man started the the class by  saying I am mean I am nasty and I do not care .  He was rude  the whole entire time .  Even though I know he’s the one that wrote the book at that school he still does not have a right to talk or treat people anyway he wants to.  You must understand that  as a grown man no one likes to have to let anyone talk to them however they want to  but I had no choice but to take it because I need my firearm permit .

You know a lot of people don’t have their real names on the review page .  But that sure doesn’t mean that  I just made a big lie . Because the fact that you asked if I actually attended the course means that you assume I could be a liar because my real name is not on the review page.

But STEVE CABALLERO His name was written on the bottom of all the pages we were reading from in the class so he’ll probably remain untouched and no one will probably say anything to him.  He’s part of the board .  I mean who could really say anything to him right he probably owns the school.  He helped write the California fire arm course. But that man STEVE CABALLERO Is very rude.  I am not the type of person to try so hard to say something bad about Someone   But that man is rude and disrespectful.  But please take into consideration the kind of person who would stand in front of the class and his first sentence and impression to everyone else is that I am mean I’m nasty and I don’t care .  He literally said that ask him .<//Review>< Pics>

{'time': 1564587695581, 'text': "Gunny does not own the school - I do. The reason I provided you my email address was because I wanted to get to the bottom of this and have a personal dialogue with you, which I cannot do if you are operating under an alias and refusing to email or call me directly. My name is Brandon Banks and I can be reached at management@safta-inc.com. If you take it upon yourself to reach out you will hear from me, or my business partner and COO, Jessie Meeker. As I said in the prior response, I would (and have already) had a discussion with my staff about this to try to make sure that other students don't have a similar impression that you do. Having said that, (1) take a look at the other reviews - while all input is relevant - your feedback is what would be considered an outlier view, (2) submitting a second 1-star review, again under an alias, is not productive - what would be productive is having a conversation with me directly as I have offered and am again, and (3) you have to understand that Steve is trying to prepare people for a job where you will be carrying a baton and a firearm, and lives can and sometimes will be at stake. Steve is certainly rough around the edges and sometimes that is good as it gets folks to focus in a classroom environment, when many do not. This is not an admin industry. Gunny is a decorated Marine Corps infantry combat veteran, a retired police officer, and as you said, he literally wrote the book on private security for the BSIS. I can appreciate that his approach does not work for everyone, but it is effective for most, and I am thankful to have him on my team. ALL THAT SAID, I'm still working with him to be more cognizant on how his approach can impact certain individuals."}< /Resp>

<Review>They are not on freeport anymore. They are in North Highlands. It was a note on the door saying they relocated to Myrtle ave. So call before you go to get tge correct address. Other than that it's a great place<//Review><user_name>April Boston</user_name>< rating>

<Review>They are very rude. The man that  instruct the class STEVE CABALLERO and his assistant are very rude and impolite . The first instructorSTEVE CABALLERO starts the class saying by saying Im mean I’m nasty and I don’t care .  I promise you I’m not just giving you a bad review that’s literally what he said . He basically yells at the class and talks to almost everyone like they are stupid . What really sucks is I want to come back for my baton permit hand cuff permit also but it really does sucks that you have to go through such a rude teachers and they are rude and it’s like they know it and they don’t care because they have an excuse to do it like that’s not right . People are paying for this class and the guy teaching it  is extremely rude .  He makes it very scary when you want to ask him a question about something because he’ll kind of make you feel stupid  about whatever you’re asking.< /Review>< rating>

As a security company that is always looking for new guards, we always start with SAFTA. The staff here are very knowledgeable and professional and always keep us up to date with new candidates. A lot of our security guards have come from here, already trained, eager, and ready to learn more. JC and her team of instructors really care about their students and go above and beyond for them. Their 40 hour course assists students in getting permits and certifications for guard card, firearm, baton, penal codes, citizen arrests , handcuffing, pepperspray/mace, stungun/taser, and much more. Their prices are very reasonable and lower compared to other training schools. We would highly recommend this company for anyone looking to become a security officer or needing to get this type of training. Keep up the great work!< /text>

< Review>
I am a LIEUTENANT patrol supervisor
I've completed my PEPPER SPRAY/TEAR GAS Course  and TAZER/STUN GUN course
just last week I completed my EXPOSE FIREARMS course and BATON course .

I can proudly say I DID IT ALL ;)

I WILL ALSO SAY IT WASN'T EASY !!
IT WAS SOME OF THE HARDEST
COURSES IVE EVER TAKEN.

I WANT TO THANK THE RECEPTIONIST
FOR HER HARD WORK
AND HER HELPFULNESS

ALSO THE INSTRUCTOR
( GUNNY)
HE WAS HARD , BUT VERY WISE .
I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM HIM
IN 3 DAYS .
I APPRECIATE ALL HE HAS DONE FOR ME
AND MY CAREER.
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST TRAINING ANYONE  COULD RECIEVE.

THANK U
LIEUTENANT ORTEGA

Thank you safta
I FINALLY GOT MY BSIS FIREARM EXAM
COMPLETED AND PASSED

AND OBTAINED MY EXPOSED LICENSE

NEXT CCW

PLEASE TELL GUNNY :)<//Review>

I took the class with some friends, and I had a few issues with how the material was presented.  I provided a lot of feedback ( having run a small business I know the value of detailed feedback  - good and bad).  Management was quick to respond to my comments with either why they do something or how they plan on address  the issues.  The staff was always kind and helpful.  Fast forward a few months and I move to another county.  The staff was very quick to help me with getting paperwork done so I could start the CCW application process again.  The management of this company deeply care about their customers and doing the best they can, and I plan on calling them when I need to renew my ccw in the future.</Review><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

< Review>
The professionalism and wealth of knowledge that SAFTA provides is unparalleled. They are unequivocal in their approach and have numerous classes and training seminars designed to help empower people to become self-reliant and able to defend themselves if need arises. I took their CCW course over the span of a weekend and learned so much great information that I kept gleaning over for week's after the course. The instructor, kindly referred to as "Gunny", took as much time as we needed to instruct us in a tactful and skilled manner. We learned so many hands-on techniques, combined with classroom information on what is and is not allowed according to the rule of law.

He and all of SAFTA also made sure that we were comfortable (which was great for the ladies in the room) and not intimidated by what some would consider an intimidating course/topic. Overall, I feel exponentially more capable now to be able to defend myself if need arises, and to share with others just how to stay safe in an ever-increasingly dangerous world.  I am certain that because of the training I received at SAFTA,  I am a more responsible citizen - as are other members of my family who took the course with me.

I highly recommend SAFTA for all your training and safety needs. You will learn more than you ever imagined, and have the confidence and empowerment you need to stay safe in your personal and work endeavors.

Thank you SAFTA!

Sincerely,

Matthew Eschrich<//Review>

<Text>Mixed review!  Very nice family business, the woman is very nice and helpful which helps in such a bad situation.

However, the guys working in the night say they do not release cars after hours.  I had to cite the GIANT sign next to the window that clearly implies car ARE released after hours and that it incurs an additional fee. He stuck with his answer of there's nothing I can do due to liability and us getting hurt on the property.  A garbage answer to which we told him we DONT WANT to nor do we expect to have to go onto the property to collect our car since typically cars are brought to the gate.  We called him about 5 times and just didn't let up and he said he would see what he could do. Thru the window I saw him and another guy literally watch TV until the show was over. I was the registered owner and my renter who was the one who incurred the tow stood outside in the rain and cold the entire time. The younger guy then came outside to ask for our paperwork and was crazy condescending.

When people are in a position where they have something over another, a bit of grace goes a long way. These douchebags were about as terrible as I could imagine.  They will get there's for sure, I'm not worried about that, but these guys definitely need to be checked.</Text>< pictures>

I wish I was able to give this a zero out of 5. Absolutely poor service from the office team and you can’t really mess up a tow like come on. Just because you work with the police department doesn’t mean you can do as you wish. Sooner or later your contract will expired, and when it does the people with be happy too see y’all gone. The prices are outrageous I will not go into detail. STOP TRYING TO BELITTLE THE PEOPLE YOU ARE NOT THE AUTHORITY. This isn’t the DMV so stop acting like it. Nobody will miss you when you’re eradicated from the city. YOUR DAY OF RECKONING WILL COME!!!</Text>

They claim it’s family ran but all I see is drug addicts and meth heads running this place.  My vehicle was towed by this terrible business and when I paid the outrageous over priced amount to release my vehicle. Upon release of my brand new car, I noticed it was filthy inside and out and had the rear bumper plastic all scratched and appeared to be hit. After speaking with Sal who claims to be a manager he advised me to come on my own time to re-inspect the damages. After inspecting the damages that they are at fault for since my vehicle did not have any damages prior to being towed, Sal even said himself when they start towing they typically hit and damage exactly where he claims it occurs near tailpipe section, it was pretty clear. He promptly said that his guy that towed it did not hit it and did not provide any type of reassurance nor any type of compensation.  Not to mention you cannot file a claim against them so I have reported this “business” to the BBB and hopefully they will be shutdown or ultimately audited to be reprimanded. Nothing good about dealing with these scammers. Avoid it all costs and they certainly are doing this all in bad faith.

<username>Dustin Levens< /username><Resp>{'time': 1554143976308, 'text': 'Dustin,  NOBODY is ever happy to have their car towed, especially when it could have been totally avoided on your part.  The fact of the matter is that you admit that the vehicle was illegally parked.  We are obligated to perform to the Police Department\'s instructions when they dispatch us to pick up an illegally parked vehicle.  We have NO say in the matter.\n\nYou said "shouldn\'t someone from the tow company come to the door and tell the owner they are taking the car, maybe if they are decent people give them the opportunity to move it into the driveway"  Are you kidding??  As a matter of safety for our employees, we are not about to start knocking on doors to tell people we\'re about to haul their car away...  we\'d be met at the door with a Glock in our face!  C\'mon!\n\nAs far as the charges go, they are posted for everyone to see.  It is completely normal for towing companies to charge a gate fee for after-hours work and to charge for storage.  Like any other business, we have employees to pay, expenses and we need to make a profit to continue to provide service to the community.  We don\'t don\'t cheat people,  contrary to what you\'re insinuating.\n\nLook, we get it, we\'re consumers too.  When we screw up, we feel bad and sometimes want to blame someone else.   We don\'t fault you for that.  But we do take issue that you want to go onto a public forum and make a complaint (which is your right), but at the end of the day, any reasonable person reading your review will know what\'s really going on.\n\nThe City of Ontario knows us very well.  We are proud to have been doing business with them and supporting the Police Department and Fire Department for decades.  We\'re sure they\'ll take your complaint into consideration, but we\'re also confident they will see our position as unassailable.\n\nMaybe you could do the right thing and take down your unwarranted negative review?\n\nUPDATE:  After we posted the original reply above, we reviewed the situation with the employees who served you.  It turns out that your rudeness distracted our employee from doing an adjustment that would have prevented charging you an extra day\'s storage.  We realized the error and sent you a refund for one day\'s storage.\n\nUPDATE to customer\'s update:  You still complaining?  Our hours are our hours.  And like most towing businesses, we have standard office hours even though we provide 24 hour towing service.  It\'s unfortunate for you that your issue happened right before our office closing hours, but we\'re not responsible for that.  LOL, and you think that our standard office hours should extend into Saturday?  What about Sunday, or national holidays too?  C\'mon man...  next time, don\'t leave your car illegally parked on the street and you\'ll have nothing to worry about.  Good day sir!

<Review>Friday afternoon 4:00 I leave my house to go coach my club volleyball team, my scion xb still parked in front of my house. I had paid DMV for a Non-Op on the vehicle because of a blown engine. When I get home at 8:30pm I noticed my car gone. I go inside and ask my wife if they saw anything happen to it. I check with my neighbors nothing. I call Ontario PD about 8:45pm to report my car stolen. The lady on the phone, after looking up the license plate number tells me it was towed because a non-op vehicle needs to be in the driveway not out on the street. Ok my bad, how do I get it back? She tells me I need to come by in the morning to get a release that the tow company will need to get my car released to me. I then call the tow company that towed it. Spoke with their dispatch guy who said yes they have the car and that the fees would be $383.00 to get it out. I would need to come tomorrow (Saturday to get it before 5pm which would be 24 hours since it was towed).
Saturday morning I go to Ontario PD and get the release form. Shows the car was towed at 4:50pm. That is important. Why? because according to Dietz Towing after 5pm they are closed and if I had the ability to come get it I would have to pay $100 more because it was after hours. Keep in mind I cannot go get it because I have to wait till Saturday morning to get the release from the Ontario PD. Also, because I have no opportunity to get the car that night, they charge an additional $53 dollars of storage because it is considered the next calendar day.
Saturday afternoon after getting the release from the Ontario Police Department I get to Dietz Towing to pay the fees. The lady on the phone says wait outside till a driver comes out to talk to you. 45 min later a driver pulls into their business and then comes out. I give him the release the papers and he comes back and tells me the amount is now $535.00. I tell him no way. He says the computer tells him what is owed. An extra $100 gate fee because they are technically closed on Saturdays, and an extra $53 for storage fee.
So to sum up, within less than 24 hours my car was towed, released to me and towed back to my house and I paid $535.00 to Dietz towing.
I agree to the fact I caused this to happen in the first place due to having a non-op out on the city street in front of my house. However, shouldn't someone from the tow company come to the door and tell the owner they are taking the car, maybe if they are decent people give them the opportunity to move it into the driveway. No, they wouldn't do that because then they would not be able to collect any money, especially the extra $153.00 they get by picking it up just before closing time on a Friday.
My suggestion/complaint is two sided. One the amount I was over charged due to circumstance completely out of my control. The extra $100 for having to get it after hours, and the extra day storage of $53 because the car sat in their facility over night. The other side to my complaint is the shady practice of this company and it is being facilitated by the city of Ontario Police Department. Simply because you need to sub contract out a tow company.
I went to write a review on YELP about the company and found I am not the only one who has been scammed by this tow company.
I would love the opportunity to talk with someone about my experience and try and get the amount I believe I was overcharged for back. If getting my money back is not an option at least would like the #OntarioPD to consider not using this tow company to do the city's work.
Thank you for taking the time to read and hopefully respond to my comment/complaint.

Update: My rudeness is why they made a mistake???? LOL Another reason why my review of this business was warranted. Still believe its shady to tow a car at 5pm on Friday with no way of getting it without an extra $100 after hour fee since your business closes at 5pm. Also in my opinion shady to say your not officially open on Saturdays yet still conduct business as if you are open but charge everyone extra hour fee's. Just my opinion.< /Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The last thing you want to have happen to you is your car to break down in the middle of a road trip... guess what happened to me...

You are right- my car broke down and I had really no clue where I was.

I got on Google and found Dietz Towing and have you ever seen an angel driving a tow truck? Because that is exactly what I saw when their guy drove up to give me a tow.

They were super professional and showed up right away! What more could you ask for!? They were super gentle with my baby (that's what I call my car) and got us to the shop and we were on our way in no time at all.

HIGHLY recommend Dietz Towing and their guys if you are stuck and need a tow!<//Review>

I had problems with a rental car and the rental company sent Dietz Towing to exchange my vehicle. I was prepared for the worst but it turned out to be a very good experience all things considered. Dietz was prompt, professional and got my car exchanged in just a few minutes. I recommend them.</Text>

{'time': 1541532207721, 'text': "Hi Ceasar.  We're really sorry you had a bad experience, but we were called by the Police Department to pickup your vehicle because it was blocking traffic due to an accident.  When law enforcement calls us to respond, we are obligated to do so.\nWe're not sure how you would have understood that the pricing was misleading.  We charge a standard rate, even if your car was involved in an accident.  Towing services are not free and cities do not pay tow companies.\nWe actually extended you a courtesy...  you had someone come to pickup your vehicle and we did let them into our yard, even though they don't have a California Motor Carrier Permit.  We normally don't let un-permitted tow vehicles into our yard, but for you, we allowed it.   We also did not charge you any storage fees.\nSo all in all, we believe we provided good service to the city and to you.  We think your 1-star review is totally unjustified, but in our business, we rarely come across people who are happy to have their vehicle towed!\nI hope the rest of your day goes better.  Next time you need a tow... give us a call!  😉"}</resp>

Maybe you didn't realize this, but cars can be driven without a battery.  When we picked up your car, we did not have the key and had no reason to suspect that your car was missing it's battery.  Of course, it was discovered when you came to pick up the car and it wouldn't start.\n\nWe do not take parts out of cars and it is very unfair and malicious to accuse someone or a business of a wrong doing, when you have no facts to support your accusation.\n\nWe're sorry you had a bad experience, but it clearly wasn't our fault.  Maybe you should contact the law enforcement agency that arrested the suspect and report your stolen battery, rather than accuse us.\n\nBe fair."}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Rate>2<//Rate><Text>Pro: they stay open later than the other gyms but it's always crowded. They should stay open 24 hours like the one one Reseda since they're busy at all times.

Con: weekend hours close early.

People working out without mask.

Hardly anyone cleans anything after using it meaning I have to clean it twice.

I seldomly see a cleaning person. I've seen one and she is never really doing anything. You would think they would have staff in the gym room cleaning after those who don't wipe instead of having 3-4 people sitting in the front talking.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2892f3c878413:0x9597be1f7d77cc45< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I have a restraining order against a member who had stalked me at my previous gym, where I was employed. My husband and I were not able to use the gym (as members) because the stalker came at the only times our schedules allowed. The manager had no interest in honoring the restraining order (or even LOOKING at it), INCLUDING when we came to get a refund. They said they’re not “required” to. Incredibly disappointing to see a complete disregard for the safety of the female members (myself included) and staff, seeing as the man is a repeat offender.

If there are any female staff or members that get harassed or stalked by said member, I hope they file a joint lawsuit against this company, since they have been notified of the possibility and take no action. Any company that only caters to safety when it is required, is questionable AT BEST. And shame on corporate IF they backed the manager, Tony Amayo (not sure if I spelled it right since he wore no name tag), as he claims they did. Very poor professional conduct, especially in this social climate.</Review>

<text>If I could add zero stars, I would. Back in June of this year, I attempted to cancel my membership due to concerns of COVID. I went on the Crunch Fitness website and sent a request to freeze/cancel my membership to the Santa Clarita email. A few months later, I noticed that I was still being charged for my membership, and I was also being charged late fees for no apparent reason. I came in in August to discuss this discrepancy, only to be nonchalantly dealt with by one of the managers, who really treated it as if it was some kind of joke. When I cancelled the membership, I was charged a $20 cancellation fee, although I was charged two or three days before for my membership. I highly highly recommend not going to this gym, even if they are one of the few gyms with outdoor equipment available in Santa Clarita. Just wait for 24 Hour Fitness to open up again or do bodyweight exercises, anything to save your money and avoid this gym.</text>< Name>

<review>Just received a threat text message saying that my information will be sent to collections. My account has been closed since April last year because of covid.
Just like Andrew I was also being charged until l contacted my bank. The. Manager there is useless and doesn't want to return anybody's money or deal any of it< /review><Time>1611941575849<//Time><response>None</response>< name>

<Text>I work out here.. I’ve been really upset with the service since the reopening. I drive from Stevenson Ranch to this gym and I get told if I don’t have a towel I can’t come in CDC rules. Yet that’s not what the website or flyers on the door state. So I was forced to leave and come back rep. was rule and unprofessional. And follow CDC guide lines please because no cleaning materials are available to clean the machines!! And no one cleans the whole time im there. I feel like I have to be doing there job. Which makes me want to take my business elsewhere.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1594394981428, 'text': 'Hey Evelin, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and cleanliness issues.

Crunch gym is affordable! It's nice that with these prices more people have access. The equipment seems up to date the staff is nice. I don't care much for the music, it's offensive sometimes but other than that I love Crunch and love the perfect location too! Thank you Crunch.👵🏋️‍♀️🤸‍♀️< /review>

Angela AWESOME trainer!  Company are THIEVES.  LONG STORY but thievery happened to 3 people I know & to me.  Should you sign up for training, HIGHLY RECOMMEND you mention you're ONLY signing up for which ever level you choose x one month, if that's what you want.  For example $600 for 12 sessions.  Otherwise they will charge your bank acct each & every month.  They never verbally inform you or point out when signing electronic pad that contract is a monthly agreement.  When you finally realize this to be the case, they make it SOOO DIFFICULT to refund your bank acct.  One of my friends was NOT refunded $450 for 1 month.  If this happens to you, talk to your bank.  Different banks have different policies, but they will help.  You'll be grateful for their help.< /Review>

< review>
They gym is  nice and maintained it's almost always empty I'm guessing due to the lack of business. The staff is unhelpful always talking amongst them selves. don't bother asking any one any questions they will just direct you to go online . I've managed pretty big gyms during my carrier and behaviors and culture like this would be unacceptable. If some one has questions about classes (I don't know maybe you should try to sale them a package . After all that's your job if everything was done online I don't think the sales position would be around for long )  I also see that most of the positive reviews are based on the training staff that's because most of the time trainers are individual contractors and have to put their best effort to keep their clients happy .</review>

I signed up for one month of Personal training with someone that is no longer there.  Said person (Boris) did not tell me I would be charged monthly until I cancelled.  I was charged a second month for $250.  If you call over the phone the staff is clueless.  There are very unprofessional and rude.  I went in on 3/4/19 and Sergio who is no longer there was rude and unpleasant to deal with.  He supposedly reversed my $250 charge and cancelled the month to month I never signed up for.  He did apologize for Boris not disclosing the month to month.  He assured me I would be refunded $250 in 7-10 days.  Here we are 4/2 and still no refund.  I patiently waited til 3/26 and Davis said he would take care of it and call me back the same day to resolve the issue.  Never heard from him...very unprofessional.  On 3/28, I was there again and asked Davis about the status of my return.  He never did anything and then and there just pawned me over to some lady.  I was so upset I didn't even get her name. At this point I felt like I've been given the run around.  The only thing she did was make a copy of my refund receipt from 3/4 along with my cancellation receipt, and license.  She told me I would get a refund in 7-10 days. I wrote this review today because I just got a $49 maintenance fee charge.  Maintenance charge?...they never even have soap or paper towels in the bathroom!! I will be calling corporate about my refund.  At this point I will be canceling my membership.</review>

Clean. Nice staff. Good options, I love the functional area for those who don’t have the UFC membership. Love the space as well. Can’t beat the price for those not needing any guidance. Recommend this to anyone. It also has showers (clean) and nice lockers. Temperature of gym is perfect as well. Music could be better but not bad.</text>

<Review>I had a bit of a rocky start at this gym with weird billing issues (I kept getting charged late fees when I was making my payments on time) but they were able to clear the charges and I haven’t had any issues for the last few months so I’m assuming I won’t have that problem again. The gym itself is nice, there’s a large variety of working gym equipment to use and they even have Olympic plates which is great. I came from 24 where half the machines were always broken and all they had were cracked and chipped bumper plates, so this is a definite upgrade. It’s never so busy that you can’t get a good workout in, but I wish they had a couple more deadlift platforms and squat racks to work with. I never do personal training sessions and it sounds like that’s where a majority of their issues come from, so if you’re not about that then you should be okay.</Review>< Name>

< review>
DO NOT join this gym. It is the WORST in Santa Clarita. The worst service I have ever received and not even worth $10/month. I was a member for less than a year and the issues started from day one! And if you do join DO NOT trust the employees with your kids in the kids care. They have the worst music playing so loud that you can't even hear your own headphones! They lock the free weights room unless there is a class which means I can't even do that. No sauna and the machines are not great.
My issues began when I first wanted to use child care and the employee was on their phone. Didn't even notice I was trying to drop off my son. After literally standing there for a minute, I walked away. I then requested to cancel kids care because who can trust anyone to watch their child when they don't even notice a full grown adult in the doorway. I continued to be billed for another 4-5 months. The GM at the time (Jabarai) kept promising time after time to cancel it and give me a full refund. Then he disappeared, never having resolved my issue.
Months went by that I could no longer use the gym now that I don't have child care. And still no resolution to my refund so I finally decided to cancel my membership. Nightmare ALL over AGAIN. I emailed the GM at Crunch and he redirected me to another email. I then sent my request to them and received an automatic response stating that I should hear back within 3-5 business day. TWO full weeks later and NOTHING. So I reached out to the GM who only apologized for the inconvenience and didn't do anything from there.
I finally decided to give my honest review on Facebook.  I received a response from customer service to PM them and so I did and they said they reached out to the SCV branch to fix my issues. The new GM (Daniel) now reaches out. He says since now there's an email thread about me trying to cancel, that he can do it from his end. Still unsure why he couldn't do that after I had mentioned that no one had responded to my request. Long story short, he promised to fix my issues (my refund included though he would have to go through corporate) and he would give me 6 months free gym membership and free child care but also asked if maybe that'll get me to take down my negative review on FB. I thought "great" he's going to get things done and I told him I would think about it. Emailed him to let him know "hey let's get that refund finalized and go from there (clean slate)." I never got an email back so I finally called today where he all of a sudden found my email.
Then he backtracks and says well if I give you the refund then I can't give you the 6 months which completely defeats the purpose of "making it up to me" all he is doing is keeping my money and finally using it for kids care that I still feel uneasy about! I told him how it felt like he was saying "take it or leave it" and he says "I'm sorry you feel that way."
I'm sorry but NEVER going back. I'll be joining another gym in SCV and taking my friends with me. I already had a friend cancel her membership. And a second one has also decided to post her negative experiences at Crunch Fitness.<//review>

they won’t let me cancel my account, and they never told me that it was a year contract. Basically they scam you into signing up and then sap your money for a whole year regardless of whether or not you use it. And if you try to cancel, they will make you pay out the rest of the year’s monthly fees. Which means there’s no point to canceling it because one way or another, your money is theirs. I called and talked to different people, all of which said different things. No one is on the same page and I recommend you choose a different gym. I don’t even have the energy to describe to you the hoops they have made me jump through. Other gyms may be a little more expensive, but it’s worth it to actually get the customer service and honesty.</Text>

<Text>Absolute worst gym to go to!!!! From the comments it appears that they are running a personal training scam.  I was assigned to a personal trainer that left 3 weeks into my training sessions. Then I was assigned to someone else but I was unable to meet with them because of child care. I asked the manager if he would credit me $180 of the PT i purchased towards child care. Jabari , said he would grant it as long as I email him. I sent him an email and I never heard back from him. I sent him a follow up email and nothing. I've called SEVERAL times trying to get a hold of him but in the three months that I've been trying to get a hold of him he is always  "touring" or " in a meeting. This is just one encounter I had with them . The only time they have provided medicore customer service was when I forked out almost $500 to sign up with this inconsistent gym . Worst gym to be a part of.< /Text>< user_id>

<date>1564035678005</date><Rate>1< /Rate><review>On April 4, 2019, I signed up for personal training with Davis, the personal training manager at the Santa Clarita CRUNCH FITNESS for a package of 8 sessions which also included 2 additional sessions for free.  The cost was $480.00.  Unlike a standard business contract, there was NO paperwork just Davis indicating for me to sign on the electronic signage pad for my training package.  NEVER ONCE did he mention there would be a monthly recurring charge of $480.00.  Of course I signed because I was purchasing my 8 + 2 training sessions and I wanted to pay for them.  WHY would I question that?  Any legitimate and ethical business would advise you that you were actually signing a monthly recurring contract.  Again NOT ONCE was ANYTHING mentioned about being charged monthly for additional training sessions.

On May 6, 2019 a company named ABC FINANCIAL took $480.00 out of my account and again on June 4, 2019 took another $480.00.   A TOTAL of $960.00 was taken from my account that I NEVER AUTHORIZED.

While under the impression that I was ONLY paying for my 8 + 2 sessions, I did sign their electronic signage pad.  Though, because of their misleading, dishonest and corrupt business practices, in reality I was UNKNOWINGLY signing a contact that was allowing them to charge me monthly for sessions that I never intended to have.

I went into CRUNCH FITNESS and spoke to Jabari Day, the club manager on June 10, 2019 regarding the unauthorized charges  He then completed a “Request For Refund” form and informed me that I would be refunded the $960.00 in 7-10 business days.

I did receive a check dated June 27, 2019 for $480.00.  I immediately contacted Jabari Day inquiring about the remaining $480.00 still owed to me, and he said he would look into it.  After two weeks of multiple phone calls and emails to Jabari Day, all of which were ignored,  I started sending letters to the founders of CRUNCH FITNESS, Curtis and David Harman. I also spoke to Nic Soszynski, the Business Customer Service, Creative Coordinator.  After all of this, I was informed they are not going to refund the additional $480.00.  Their willingness to refund half of what is owed to me implies they recognize that they were guilty of poor business ethics.

I personally know of others that have been deceived by CRUNCH FITNESS in the same manner as I have been.  After researching I’ve found online what seemed to be a never ending list of complaints of the deceitful and shady business practices of CRUNCH FITNESS stealing money from members.<//review>< pics>

Please steer clear from here.  They are liars and don't uphold to what they tell you. They have a new general manager because apparently the other one didn't perform well.  Well now they have someone new that can't either.  No one has the authority to do anything.  I called them the day my bank returned their attempt to take money out. The lady that answered the phone said she didn't see anything yet. I offered to come in and pay. She said it wouldn't help because they already attempted to take money to wait a few days when it clears and to come back and pay it. And its exactly what I did. And was told that the late fee will be waived. I now checked my bank and ontop of my monthly fee they charged me a late fee and stated they can't reverse it. The new general manager was unwilling to help or even care instead he was being coindesecding and didn't care that he was losing my business, there are so many other gyms in this area, I regret coming to this one. Plus their hours are inconvenient .< /Text>

I would love to give this gym 5 starts, as my husband loves this place and has a UFC membership for more than 2 years. So my husband open a Crunch trial for me to try the gym on February 24 but he was told the Crunch would not start until February 27. We went yesterday to try the new Crunch, and I was told my trial expired on February 27. I was surprised and confused as I had no clue that the pass was already activated and had expired the first day the new gym just opens?! Anyway the staff was very sweet and showed me around, and explained that the classes are starting only the next day as they just opened the gym. And on top of that she reactivate my trial for 15 days for me to try the classes!!! I got very excited. All sounds so promising for me to stick with this gym! Today, first day of clases and I’m there to try it. Yay! Unfortunately, my trial is expired again!!! I am very disappointed and ask to talk to the manager. After explaining the situation to the manager, his name is Sergio, instead of a warm helping customer service personnel who suppose to help you and make the situation better, I’ve got only throwing balls at me as it’s my fault that my trial expired. I am shocked that Sergio is a manager!!! I had an amazing experience yesterday with a simple employee, who is way above this manager in customer service. Just be nice and fix the problem. Does it matter if I’m more wrong or more right than you? Why keep pushing? He gave me 4 more days to try the classes. What about the 15 days that I was given/promised yesterday? The whole today’s experience get me so frustrated. I came home crying and told my husband he is not going to this gym anymore! This gym would rather loose 2 members... so disappointing 👎< /text>

I regret not keeping my membership at 24 hour fitness. Crunch made big promises to get me to sign up. They close early and it's almost impossible to get in contact with the owner. This is a franchise branch and headquarters dosent care what these people do. I'd skip this place and run to 24 hour fitness instead.< /Text>

< Review>
I celebrated my PhD this evening in this delicious restaurant. I am glad to say that we had a astonishing evening and the place was certainly one of the reasons for that strong gathering. The crew  cooperated in a sweet manner, the food was yummy and my buddies were extremely  happy. We shall definitely return for more celebrations. thanks very much.< /Review>

<Text>What happened we used to come here all the way from San Diego and we just came in today the atmosphere felt unwelcoming we were not greeted at all we had to scream hello waited a good minute till we were noticed and the lady that was there she didn’t have a smile once on her face while talking to us but yet another group came in and she was all friendly and happy...it’s the 21st century people no more discrimination at least if you go to a Filipino restaurant your treated like fam... other than that the quality of the food it was okay the potato salad was very much spoiled already...kimchi was amazing tho...they can work on the customer service a bit more I like the young Korean guy that works here he’s always nice to me and my family... I might come back but I have been to a better Korean bbq on western Ave just saying I don’t think we will be coming back...< /Text><name>Rose Rubio< /name><time>1554866085849<//time><Resp>None<//Resp><UserId.>109788288323962470930<//UserId.><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBscoWPRAYAJPbhCraf2PRcgjpN8ALIjgl_xC7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPS99DZ9L6lKtiBzY1_nY0M2MjKUKsTIbM2bqIq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNVg26VAZGkGGMC7hCgikvq79tDElfl6GF1eZD_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><rate>3< /rate></record>

I never miss an opportunity to go to this restaurant. when  I feel like having a delicious lunch, this place comes straight to my head. best and all sorts of  food and a large menu.trained staff members, and great atmosphere. Also important, the charge is modest. I recommend this restaurant with pleasure.< /Review><Name>Dylan Baldwin</Name><user_id>117073960786667575612<//user_id>< rate>

This is a hard sell as there are so many places to choose from in this area.  But for 19$ you get a reasonable assortment of meats, they are pretty good quality and they are fairly generous with the portion they give you.  The brisket is good, the bullgogi is good (not the best), the other meats are good too.  Good service, kind employees.   Now, decor is very 1980s strict mall antique, but it has been around for some 20 years and they seems to like to keep that rundown ambience.   Go for the meat, the service, and the full belly after.<//review>

Abundant meal. However I found the pork meat harder than other similar places. It's relatively near the airport, which is an advantage in case you need to grab a meal before travelling. Be reminded it takes some time to cook the different meats.</Text>

Only thing I didnt like was the potheads smoking in the parking. We came with children and although it is legal to smoke, I feel that they should be more considerate when there is a family establishment next door. And that smoke shop is the only reason I dont think we will ever return.

The music from the smoke shop was way too loud for us to really enjoy our meal. The place and food was good! If they were placed anywhere else I would consider coming back, but being 8 months pregnant and having to  deal with inconsiderate potheads/smokers to get to the resturant, I dont think I will return.< /Review>

The food was ok. The service was slow even though my party of 7 were the only ones there. Our waitress was also rude. When asked to split the bill she rolled her eyes at us and gave an audible groan. This ruined the experience of an already limited all you can eat list.<//text>

The food was amazing. I had pork rib bbq and in my opinion it's even  better than the ones in some of the bbq restaurants in Korea! The kimchi was authentic and tasty as well. The portion was good and the service was excellent. Servers could speak in Korean! Overall I strongly recommend this place<//Review>

I gave MAPO the benefit of the doubt with my review.  It's a 30+ year old business that is family run by 3 generations.   The place is old and the service was ok.  The servers were nice but were kinda just mom and pop -ish in terms of service.  Food was decent.  For $20 per person for all you can eat, it was OK.  I'm on the fence whether I'd really come back.  It's probably worth one visit if you're in the area.</Review>

The waitress was nowhere to be seen and when she was she was ignoring us and serving this one group only, even cooking for them when you don’t do that at Korean bbqs. The cashier had the audacity to chase after us when we were leaving to ask for tip for the waitress. There’s no problem tipping if it’s good service, but this was absolutely terrible and the food not the greatest here. There’s definitely better places to go to.

Later went to another Korean BBQ that only charged $25 for two people major difference in quality. This place should be your "last option" if you don't want to go far and don't mind overspending. Waiter was a chubby waiter who was slightly rude and NOT HAPPY to serve us, usually rolling his eyes or giving off bad vibes when we asked nicely and thanked him for anything. Grill caught fire once we finished cooking our food and meats were so frozen it was slightly difficult to cook.

Great little spot, hidden away. Meat and sides had a great flavor. I went on a Tuesday night. I was a bit empty when our party of 3 arrived but got packed around 8pm.

Good flavor; slow service of 1 or 2 waiters.<//text>

I can't say enough about this place . Service is AMAZING!!! OPTIONS ARE GREAT . AND THE PRICE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD . ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE 3 OR MORE PEOPLE.  !!! I just started eating "kbbq this year.  And the places I've been have rude workers and it's almost a burden to request things . This place is so welcoming and just a great place I've been here 4 times in 2 weeks. THANKS GUYS<//text>

Horrible...I should have listened to my gut instinct when I didn't see any Korean guests there on a Saturday night. The food was tasteless and the cuts of meat were terrible.  First time going there and customer service was horrible.  I usually don't say harsh things, but they ruined our night. Let's see... they charge for not eating all the meat brought to you, which is understandable... but for the brisket, they brought out nearly 3lbs of meat, which was hard to digest.
Looking past it, they use grates that stick to the food which look like they were bought at the 99 cent store... once the charcoal built up and there was a very large flame... Instead of changing to a clean grill which normal places usually do, they lift it up and add lettuce down below the grill to prevent flare ups. Yes you heard me right,  lettuce.  After the lettuce burned away and another flare up, many leaves of lettuce went down below. We couldn't believe it, asking if we were okay, I asked for a single piece of steak...it never came.  Then deciding to leave, I directly handed the man the water container, and said he'll bring more, but he never came back.

The entire restaurant was filled with Non-Korean customers...and I thought, if they own people won't even eat here this is a bad sign. I felt bad to all the "foreign guests" becsuse this is probably their interpretation of Korean BBQ. Little did they know that they were duped and the experience was lackluster.

Once again, I never write bad things about others... however I feel compelled to warn "foreign guests" to beware of this place.  I wish I could stand in front and tell people not to eat here... however with no wait, with more than enough available seating, Non-Korean guests kept walking through the door.

If you're reading this, don't even try to give it a shot, you'll seriously regret it and be out 36 dollars for the night. Go to Moon BBQ or any other Korean BBQ joint. Don't cry afterwards saying that I didn't warn you!<//Review>

Food is good, but it is unfortunately right next to a noisy marijuana shop, so you have a lot of shady and high people walking around aimlessly or smoking pot in their cars.<//Review>

I really like this Korean BBQ spot for it to be local, I would say one of the best small Korean BBQ spots in the South Bay, they are very friendly and give you a home like feeling, I even asked the cook / butcher how his certain beer tasted and he gave me and my girlfriend a cup of beer to try for free.<//Review>

This is maybe one of the smallest kbbq that I have been to. The grill/wire mesh thing kept moving around, I have never had a learning curve to a kbbq grill. Besides that the food was good. They had the thinnest cuts of brisket, there's an up and down side to that. The best thing this place has going for itself is that they made a custom spicy sauce, and lemon drink for us. This place will be my cheap kbbq standard.</review>

I'm Korean and this place is the worst. The side orders are cheaply made and way over priced. Ventilation is none existent.  If your gonna pay 30- 50 a person they should offer you rice for free. The kitchen is absolutely dirty.  I  was walking my son into the mens bathroom I saw the chef come out the stall and not wash his hands. Just wiped them on his shirt . To bad I already ate otherwise we would've left. I paid $48 for 12 peices of meat  and soup. The soup I ordered is literally made with Korean bean paste and squash potato and radish. I make it at home and it's cheaper than a combo meal at any fast food place .  I had to ask for my charged rice 4 times. I felt so bad for the none Koreans in there getting ripped off and not knowing it. I almost invited them all to my house and cook them the same dinner for  $15 . I'm not a picky eater and I never complain even if my order is wrong. I'll just eat it. But this place is a disgrace and doesn't deserve the title Korean Bbq. Drop the mic.<//text>

<Text>Great customer service, the chef is always so nice to us and sometimes brings us extra meat to try even if is not part of the deal we got. The food is good and always fresh, I've never been given frozen meat is always fresh.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

First time having Korean BBQ, and it was amazing. I am from New Orleans, and  I will definitely come back to this restaurant when I come back to L.A. The staff was so nice and helpful and the meat was great.<//text>

Meat wasn't really as expected, service was very slow and me and my girlfriend were accompanied by one other couple, and their 10.99 deal was bs because when you get inside its says three or more people required.. Pretty much saying that you have to get a third wheel if you are just a couple wanting to go out.. The owner is stengy and blocks off parking for some reason<//review>

Took my mom for her 1st experience in Korean BBQ. I've had it before in K-town but this place is better than most of the other ones I've been to.  They have a 9.99 steak , pork and chicken special during  week days , but we went for the 13.99 a plate which came with beef bulgogi,  spicy pork butt, pork belly &  individual small steaks for each patron. The kimchi was superb and so was the marinades and the quality of the meat. Place has plenty of parking and it is nestled in an unassuming shopping center, blink and you'll miss it. There is plenty of parking. Service was prompt and very friendly, they switch our grill constantly and kept bringing out more kimchi. A must if you are in the are and hungry for good Korean bbq.<//text>

(Translated by Google) The only place in the Gardena area where you can enjoy a charcoal barbecue. Especially, the 'Zobi Myori' is a special part that tastes good but is expensive.

(Translated by Google) Even though I ordered the most expensive $ 30 among the meat-free menus, if the meat is this much, I don't like the meat. The side dish is not very delicious either. I don't want to recommend it

(Original)
고기무제한 메뉴중에 가장 비싼 $30짜리 시켰는데도 고기가 이정도면 다른건 어떻게 먹나 싶을정도로 고기가 별로입니다. 반찬도 썩 맛있지 않고요. 추천하고 싶지는 않네요</review>

(Translated by Google) Mapo BBQ which we learned by introduction is really delicious.
Swallows in particular is really 쥑.
Melt gently in your mouth.

Thru introduction of this Mapo galbi, it is wonderful.
Especially Jebi choori I don't know English name but it is fsntastic.
Try it.

The food and coffee were delicious. The service was excellent too. I had a western omelet.
It had ham, green peppers, and onions. It was good. They don't allow you to substitute toast for pancakes. You have to purchase a complete pancake order. They have indoor and outdoor seating. They also have a very large parking lot.</text>

Stopped in here for breakfast during COVID on our way to the Zoo. We were staying in old town and wanted to sit down and eat a decent meal before we headed into the park. They had outdoor dining set up which was nice. Only downfall was the cold weather on this specific morning, but they can't control the weather and the food here was pretty good. Everything came out hot, and our server kept our drinks full. We all had a nice meal and this hit the spot before our adventure at the SD Zoo. Fueled up and ready to hike around! We will be back the next time we are in the area. Hopefully they will have indoor dining by then.</text>

< review>
On several occasions I've went to Perry's and encountered rude staff. The waitress sat us down and my cup was cracked. I politely told her she let out a disgruntled sigh and replaced it. As I was reading the menu I found dried lettuce on my fork! After many attempts I flagged down our waitress and showed her. Same response and no apology. I'm a bit disgusted by this time. My husband says we've waited for so long let's just eat and leave. My husband and I order we eat our food, which was good. We proceed to exit and a young man is at the counter ringing us up reading a magazine or a paper  without even looking up says "Tip on the card"? My husband apparently put off by the encounter waits. The young man says it again without looking up. My husband again waits for him to look up. In a manner to suggest my husband is slow the young man says "TIP ON THE CARD"! My husband says not sure if you were talking to me or the magazine and says no no tip our service was terrible. He scoffs at my husband and we leave. Yes, they've been around for quite some time and the food is good, but the customer service is horrendous. We have not returned and refuse to do so. We work hard for our money and we spend it where we feel like valued customers. I'm still very put off by the dirty dishes and bad service.</review>

My first time to this iconic San Diego breakfast restaurant and it did not disappoint! Generous portions and tons of options to choose from like 3 different types of breakfast sausages and many types of toast/bread to go with your plate. I felt full and very satisfied when leaving and I can't wait to return!<//Review>

Literally everything that makes a great breakfast place. Delicious food in huge portions for low prices served up by a friendly staff! I swear my coffee was empty for 30 seconds at most, they were on top of it!</Review>

What a great cafe. My wife loves the biscuits and gravy! And I haven't found one thing that is not bad. I have tried two different types of their frittatas. Home fries potatoes awesome. Refried beans awesome. Everything is made in house. No need for salt and pepper, even thou they ask if you want them.<//Review>

Perrys Cafe is open again! Best breakfast in town! Great lunch too. Traditional breakfast food and awesome Mexican dishes too. Safe outdoor dining area. Had lunch there yesterday, beef taco and enchilada plate was excellent. If you haven’t been there, nows the time to go!< /review>

My Mexican breakfast burrito was really good, but my wifes American breakfast tasted literally nothing. Eggs and hashed browns were completely void of taste and the bacon was severely overcooked. The roast was good though. The waitress was nice but forgot about us on two occasions.< /Review>

The food was great, atmosphere was great, everyone was great but our server. Not sure if she was having a bad day or if she was just trying to rush to flip her tables but she was not very friendly at all, kept rushing, every time she brought something to our table we would say thank you and she would just walk away, if we asked for something it was like a hassle for her. But other than her nasty service everything else was great.<//review>

Perry's is a classic, OG San Diego restaurant, the best breakfast in town! It's really great for lunch, too. I highly recommend it, I know you'll be glad you tried it. They have a huge outdoor dining area too, so as soon as it's allowed, they're a safe place to eat.<//review>

Quite a wait for seating due to local occupancy restrictions but worth the wait. Wonderful space to eat outside. Amazing food. Even more amazing staff. Very attentive. Great prices. Would definitely return to this gem.<//Text>

<Review>I've passed by and lived around the area but have never given them a try. Glad that I finally did. Cute cafe located off the 5 close to Old Town and Rosecrans. If I'm not mistaken I believe they've been open since the 80s. Our server was very nice and always checked up on us.

Food:
Bacon, Eggs and Fruits
Corned Beef Hash,  Eggs, Fruits and Side White Toast.

The bacon and eggs were good but the corned beef hash was delicious. The fruits were also plentiful. We washed it down with a nice hot coffee.

Overall, a great restaurant, little older but great workers.<//Review>< user>

I got to go at Perry's. The Combo Fritata and biscuits and gravy. I dont have any pictures unfortunately.

The fritata is always amazing. I like normal omelettes but the fritata is just always better in my opinion. The biscuits and gravy are some of my favorite in San Diego.

For me Perry's is a breakfast place. They do serve lunch but I cant ever get enough of the stuff they serve for breakfast.

Is there better places? Maybe. I dont think so though. Thanks Perry's for being consistently amazing with amazing delicious food.< /Text>

< Review>
I just went for the first time and I already adore this place. The retro vibe, the quick and attentive staff, short wait for food, sugar and cream on the table. This place runs like a well oiled ship. Our table was bussed before we could blink our eyes after getting up. I had a waffle egg bacon combo. The waffle was very similar to Waffle House waffles from back east that I have been missing badly. My husband had a spinach frittata (that was not skimped with cheese in the least) with hash browns that I stole a bite of, his meal was very good. Our waitress made her rounds offering a coffee fill every time she passed our table. We were both seriously impressed and will be back soon.

I came back and tried more things. The biscuits are not flaky fluffy buttermilk biscuits, they're more crumbly like cornbread.

The chips and guacamole and really good. They make the chips to order. They were still hot and a little chewy on some parts.</Review>

<text>Awesome old school dinner. Huge menu for breakfast and lunch items. Service was great and prices were reasonable.

We had about a 20 minute wait but we'll worth it. It's a great place to hit breakfast before heading into old town. Foods good and so is the coffee. Definitely worth checking out if you haven't been there.<//text><user>110295935640569709423</user>< pictures>

<text>Long time, well known San Diego diner serving breakfast and lunch. The waitresses are friendly. The service is fast. I usually go for breakfast and sit at the counter so I am seated quickly. This place gets packed but I never see people waiting too long to be seated. Still, the wait is worth it. The portions are large and reasonably priced. It is much better than a Denny's.< /text><user_id>107031983569496730173< /user_id>< Response>

Ordered takeout and the food was phenomenal! Pancakes are absolutely amazing as well as the omelets and muffins!
To piggy back off of someone else’s post, there were no seasonings on the eggs/omelet, but I was okay with that as I got to season it myself.</text>

Enjoyable old school restaurant with a huge breakfast and lunch menu. Career waitresses serving up food that was prepared before your eyes in the open kitchen.
This place brought back nostalgia of "the old days". Hidden gem. I'll be back.
Beat the hipster crowds and just get good comfort food here!
Huge parking lots too.< /Text>

<text>This place is fantastic. If you're nearby, just eat here. When we arrived there was a line out the door. I gave my name and party size and we went outside to wait. Not a great start to the first experience but boy was it worth it. Waitress was very nice and polite and while everything she did she did quickly she never seemed to not pay attention to us. This place has a very vintage diner feel to it and it was an awesome experience. Prices are what you'd expect for breakfast, but the food was some of the tastiest I've had in my life. I ordered the 2 eggs 2 bacon and 2 strawberry pancakes (subbed out the bacon for sausage) and they were some of the best pancakes I've had in my life. Long story short, if you're anywhere close to Perry's you need to eat here. You won't regret it<//text>< Pics>

<Text>Excellent service, Great, fresh, quality food. Fair and reasonable prices. All this said, even though there is nothing I can say bad about the place we didn't experience anything special that told us we need to go back again and soon.<//Text>< Rating>

<text>A consistently delicious breakfast joint at the junction between the 5 and 8 freeways.

This place was my go-to for a long time. Today reminds me why I stopped coming here.

Everything we ordered came cold. The banana pancakes are misleading, and should be called pancakes with a banana. Normally the babe would imply banana in the batter. Here it means there's a banana rolled up in your pancake, and then it'll be served in the least convenient shape possible.

My chorizo and eggs taste great, but my extra well done, extra crispy hash browns were probably steamed to death before being dropped in oil (not to fry, but to soak). It's frustrating.

The coffee was worth 3-stars on it's own because it's pretty good, but also wasn't warm enough.< /review>

Excellent service and food! First time at Perry's, the Italian frittata was amazing. It was by far the best I've had. Wait time was minimal, as there is plenty of seating for twos, singles, and larger groups.

Update a year later:
Nothing has changed. Everything's still great!< /text>

Came around 11AM on a Saturday. Wait was very short, maybe about 5-10 mins. Food came out fast and was overall good. Potatoes (both hash browns and home fries) were a bit bland. Biscuits and gravy was very good!< /review>

The food was ok not really that great though just plain ole ok. The service was not all that great, maybe our waitress was having a bad day but she was very short with us and was fast to sort of just slide our food on the table and walk away. Again maybe it was her attitude due to a bad day but.  We will not be going back.   I really dislike leaving bad reviews but Perry's  in no way shape or form lived up to their sign out front that boasts they are the best breakfast in San Diego.  I felt like I was at Mel's diner (the t.v. show) but instead of getting served by Alice we got Flow on a bad day :(

We were really looking forward to trying this place out.   Oh well every little adventure doesn't have to always work out.   Now we can say we've been there done that and we can warn our friends :)<//review>

This place was very busy for a Saturday. I think maybe because of the location. Aside from that, the food was ok. But the place was really dirty. There was some sort of food on the mug on the table, the window shades were splattered with old food. And the bathroom made me gag from the rotten sewage smell.</text>

I used to consider this a very nice place to eat. Last time I was there I was not impressed at all with the service and the quality of the food. That is some time ago they may have improved so I would say give them a chance and see what you think maybe your standards are not as high as mine.</Text>

I still wonder why so many people think this diner is so good. The food isn't bad, it's just so so ( Not "So Good" ). If I'm just trying to find someplace to get by and feed myself calories in that neck of the woods, then it gets the job done. If your trying to really enjoy the meal both taste wise and otherwise look else where. Jump across the street to Old Town for a Spanish or Mexican Style Breakfast and have a better experience overall!< /Text>

Fast service with tons of parking, seating and options.  Classic diner food.  Decent coffee.  I’d skip the blueberry muffin next time.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  Large groups are easily accommodated as well.<//text>

Great Southern and Mexican combination.

Very nice portions and reasonably priced.

Expect a wait but once seated service was prompt and all the dishes were delicious.</Review>

Once you order your breakfast it doesn't take long for your food to arrive.  Everything is fresh and hot, besides being tasty. The waitress is very attentive.  When ever we visit San Diego we go to Perry's at least one time during our stay. If you are looking for a good breakfast this is your place.  👍👍</review>< pictures>

Such a nice coffee place. The staff is great and they do make the best handcraft coffee here.
We got vanilla latte which is just the right sweetness . Their americano taste like real coffee instead of the burn one from Starbucks.
Lots of space and seats to study or chit chat. There's a park on the back so you can sit and enjoy the weather also.</text>

I've been to Perry's before and have delighted. This time I ordered a mixed cheese omelet with the eggs done soft and they were brought hard, I sent them back and I got them back and this time they weren't done. They were too soft not completely done. Upset my stomach. Our server was very nice, personable</Review>

Outstanding breakfast and service.  If you leave there hungry it's all on you. The meals are generous nice portions and again the personnel are on point, they get your order right out to you very quickly, the cooks all work in a smooth rthym keeping track of tickets in and getting the food out to the waitress.</Text>

<Text>What a great breakfast place! I get filled up every time I come here. The French toast is the best and my Italian omelet was great. Nice bottomless coffee and waitresses are great!< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmmBJcPjaJWR-z-w67y4a22tu9tIiKS1jpo-zK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5DPgF0-FfhWsR8_087L3Yi2r6ax0f69owEjmR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRhw4dMbwLjD2al4T-bcgA_NYNoXtTmVoC0r0-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80deaae66a57ce09:0xa4b7d84047ea47c6</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

One of the best breakfast places in San Diego! The menu has  a wide variety of options to choose from. The atmosphere is fantastic, true diner style, and the staff is very accommodating. They keep your coffee topped off and the food is delicious. Stop in and enjoy!</Text>

<Name>Kelly Villani< /Name><Review>Excellent breakfast with excellent service! We eat breakfast here at least once every time we visit San Diego.The food is always delicious and the bottomless coffee is a bonus. They always accommodate our family of 6 with ease. I highly suggest the chorizo omelette and the pancakes are to die for. We love Perrys!< /Review>< Resp>

Excellent breakfast that never disappoints! Service is always excellent and fast once you get seated. Don't let the wait deter you, once you are seated and have ordered the food comes right out. This is one of San Diego's Best....so don't miss out.</text>

<rating>4< /rating><text>Always see lines out the door every time I pass by this place but never went in to eat. I guess they are known for some of their breakfast items, as the waitress pointed that out when I asked what she would recommend. I did not order anything that she mentioned and went with one of my favorite breakfast dishes, Country Fried Steak with Scrambled Eggs and Hash Browns. Good portion and enjoyed it. Not the best I've had but it was above average. Next I will have to order something that they are known for or what the waitress recommends.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>The food is really yummy and the portions are on the larger side. However, it is a loud and busy place on the weekends. I felt like I was shouting to my friend across the table because how loud it was. Plenty of parking, however the front desk has a wait list, they will not seat you until everyone is present.  Staff are top notch.< /text>< Name>

<text>Always great food. Even though I expected a heavy crowd for a Sunday, I think they could improve wait times. Just to pay the bill required waiting in another long line. You should never make people wait to give you money. There could also be more overflow seating. But always worth the wait< /text>< Pics>

Good place for breakfast. No matter how busy they are it still comes out fast. They have all the regulars. Coffee is strong but good and you can sit at the counter when you walk in no waiting or a short wait for a table. Just a good old style breakfast to get your day started and thoug will not be hungry for lunch. Good place to try.<//Text>

Close to Old Town in San Diego. Kinda of a business area restaurant. Little busy in the morning. Breakfast was tasty. Waitress came around once after serving my breakfast. Had to ask several times for a refill on my coffee.< /text>

This is the place for good American and Mexican food. The food portions is like trucker size food ( large size food ) make sure your real hungry. At times there is a wait but worth it. The staff are friendly and fast with there orders. Be patient when the place is real busy. Weekends can get a bit hectic with a lot of people waiting to get in. Weekdays can be better to get in,it just depends on the time you go. Hours are from 6 am to 2pm every day. And the location is great just walking distance to old town. And the old town trolley is just across the street.</Review>

I enjoyed this hometown breakfast place. It reminded my if back home in Minnesota. The pancakes were delicious and the menu was affordable. This is a great Denny's alternative. The waitresses were cute with their died green pig tails and tattoo sleeves arms. I really enjoyed this place and will be back again and again.

Plenty of free parking available on site.<//text>

<text>Great biscuits and gravy, waffles, pancakes and eggs done just right. Exceedingly busy, yet fast. Plenty of parking— so much so that he could build a mini mall behind and not squeeze his own restaurant I think</text>< pics>

Best breakfast in San Diego. Period. El Cajon or old town locations. It doesn’t matter. Best breakfast in San Diego. Period. Always a line, but the fresh food cooked any way you want makes it worth it. My family always had delicious eggs and bacon and pancakes. I enjoyed the endless coffee. Engage the waitstaff for stimulating conversation. Parking was ok. Just anticipate the wait to get in. Bring a paper or mag to keep occupied.< /text>

Black spots in my drink and the waitress didnt bother to refill when i finished. Also, why are there black olives and pickles under my fries?  Who puts hot fries on top of these? I ordered a BLT. Olives and dill pickle (mind you its not even a spear) do not go with this.
UPDATE: I got my refill and it came with more black flecks.< /Text>

I love a business with hustle, happiness and just plain great service and product (in this case, food) all in clean-nice ambience. Perry's Cafe is all this. I am so glad I saw it, stopped and went in...Leslie, my able- friendly server gets my kudos! And thanks also to Miss Perry for saving a piece of Americana in this historic building at this location...she has raised the bar at this icon of note! Definitely Recommended!!< /text>

<review>The lack of flavor in bacon was anticlimactic as well as eggs. Ate at 10 however tasted a couple hours old. My bfs eggs rancheros looked like a 99 cent can of tomato paste was poured over it. Again no flavor. Truly disappointing seeing how I was raving about the place to my out of town partner. The waitresses as always were lovely and attentive. I realize this place is under new management. They should have hired an experienced cooking crew. I would have rather sprayed raid in my mouth then eat that food again. And the prices were ridiculous compared to the quality of our meal. I think the ONLY person I would recommend this to is our dear president Trump........</review>< pictures>

The breakfast reminds me of quaint times on the farm with family. Lots of love is put into making this food and you can really taste it. The atmosphere is a bustling cafe of fun and the service is that of friends being reunited! This cafe is the most wonderful breakfast experience that one can have.</Review>

We consider Perry's Cafe to be one of the premier breakfast restaurants in San Diego.  Our family has been dining here regularly for years.  Simply put, outstanding food (and great variety within the menu) and wonderful, personal service.  One rather simple example stands out - the home fries are still made on the grill at Perry's.  At so many other restaurants, they are the heat and serve type.  Also, any of their pancakes or waffles have that "made here" quality - as in a batter that is made from an in-house recipe rather than a mix from a chain.  Whether you choose an adventurous or traditional breakfast here, you will enjoy it!!< /Text>

It's not much on appearance when you walk in, don't let that fool you. Its clean, comfortable and the people are very friendly.

There is a bit of a wait on the weekends.

The food is always great, hot and served the correct way the first time. We've never had a bad meal here.

This is my favorite go-to breakfast spot! Nothing fancy, but darn delicious food and generous portions. The prices are extremely reasonable as well. Service is always extremely friendly and fast, even when the place is crowded. And there is always plenty of parking. I have been coming here for years and will continue to do so.< /text>

Imagine every geasy spoon you have been to . If you're guessing  I'm going to compare that to Perry's, you would be right. It's certainly a cut above Denny's and about three above Norm's, meaning it is in no way bad. If you are looking for fine dining, pass on this. If you're looking for a good place to hang out with friends, this will do nicely.< /text>

<review>One of the iconic breakfast joints in San Diego. A very busy place. Breakfast are excellent. Their Specialties are frittatas, basically a fancy omelette. Endless coffee is less than 3 bucks. Most frittatas or around $11.</review><GmapID>0x80deaae66a57ce09:0xa4b7d84047ea47c6</GmapID>< pictures>

Perry's offers classic American as well as Mexican plates and diner food. Everything is prepared well and the service is great. The staff really hustles here.
The biscuits and gravy are good, the burritos are good, the omelettes are good. Everything I have ordered here has been tasty with a good portion size for the price.< /text>

This is down home cooking at its finest. Great menu. Omelets, French toast, waffles, chorizo and eggs, etc. They also serve lunch options which I haven't tried yet. Weekends are super busy so you may have a wait. You can also sit at the counter and watch the chefs work like crazy 😊 The waitresses really work hard here so make sure you tip!</text>

< Review>
I go there at least 3 times every year at least:
1 to celebrate my wife's birthday in September, 2 to celebrate our meeting and marriage in Febuary, and 3 to draw comfort before visiting her grave site every July 24th.
Perry's has pleasant memories for me as one of the places I and my wife enjoyed in San Diego, and I return because the food is ALWAYS good,  and the service is ALWAYS friendly.
Someday I will be bringing my extended family there.</Review>

This was a nice place with big portions. They didn't have some of the basics (like a basic breakfast burrito) but the food they did have was delicious and didn't break the bank. Overall, it was pretty good and I'd probably go back if I were in the area.</Text>

We've been coming here for 30+ years. Great diner food served quickly and inexpensively by professional waitpersons. Could be a wait on weekends. Only open for breakfast & lunch. Plenty of free parking. Close to Old Town.</Text>

Great food, fair prices and the service was top notch. We’re here on vacation and wanted to trying so local breakfast. Perry’s came up close to the beach and here we are. Wife and I had the chicken fried steak with eggs and home fries with biscuits and gravy and it was amazing. Portions were huge and can definitely fill a large appetite.< /Review>

Good "diner style" cafe. Ample portions, but things definitely ran on the sweet side. Couldn't finish my "orange juice", and the "berry compote" tasted like canned pie filling. Eggs, sausage and hash browns were good. Busy place - waited 15 minutes on Saturday morning 10ish.<//Text>

Food massively overpriced ($11 for eggs and ham????!!). Lifeless interior, super low class clientele (bikers and people in their pajamas) and worst service ever. Asked host for a straw. She never brought it. Asked waitress for a straw. Gave up after 10 minutes & I go get my own. 15 minutes later she arrives with a pile of straws mumbling something about multi-tasking. Checked this place for a pulse. Never found one.< /Text>

<text>I've been eating breakfast here for about 20 years.  One of the best options anywhere for a great breakfast.  Big portions with a wait staff that is ultra fast and efficient.  If traditional breakfast foods are not your thing, you can have enchiladas or anything else from their extensive menu.  Hands down, one of the best breakfasts in the West.</text>< time>

So I finally got the opportunity and was not disappointed. I had the "Gofather Omelette" if you're a sausage lover, it's for you. The homemade blueberry muffin was outstanding. I will return to try other items on the menu.</review></record>

<Text>Always busy, always great food....what a diner should be....they are only open for breakfast and lunch, and they is always a wait to get in, but it's definitely worth the wait.  Portions are a nice size and inexpensive for what you get.  Servers are generally talkative and are helpful with suggestions.  Although they are not a Mexican restaurant they do good Mexican Style breakfast better than anyone out there.</Text><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

Ok, I travel a lot,  I eat even more and I have been to places...but this one is hands down one of the best places I have visited. We had a breakfast: Caliente Frittata, Burrito Con Huevos with poached eggs, tortillas, hashbrowns and potatoes as a side. We ate everything to the last piece. And let me tell you - the portions are huge! 🤤 P.S.: whatever you eat, try the salsa - amazing!!! Oh and the waitress was very nice too (couldn't believe we finished it all 😆)< /Review>

<review>The staff is friendly and efficient but don't expect a lot of conversation as they are busy. Don't confuse it for being rude.

Good diner breakfasts with a nice variety. Not fancy but tasty.

The place is clean but a bit dated. However, the dated look adds to the feel here.

It is worth a visit if you are near old town but the are also plenty of other good places in San Diego, so don't drive too far to get there.< /review><Rating>4< /Rating><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_name>

<review>Been coming to Perry's for almost 20 years...food is consistently good portions are to share and service is personal and warm. The servers are all very professional and when they see my daughter and i coming they seem happy to see us and extend every courtesy to us. I tip generously and always compliment the staff and management. If you want good service you have to be a nice customer.

<text>I ordered the eggs, bacon and buttermilk pancakes.  The pancakes were large and I could only finish 1 but it was delicious! Coffee and water cups never got to the bottom with constant refills. Service was outstanding.< /text>< pictures>

Classic breakfast joint with Spanish and Mexican inspired dishes.  Food is delicious, coffee is strong and tasty.  Amazing service; servers and bussers are constantly hussling and turning those tables, while providing excellent customer service!</Review>

Standard old school breakfast place. If that is what you want, they execute it perfectly. There may more fancy spots with unique more options, but that is not what they are shooting for.< /Review>

<Review>Our waitress Debbie, insisted that we could not get “Egg Whites” for breakfast. She said “ because that would be wasting an egg” WHAT!
I said that doesn’t make sense, just separate or remove the yoke, no she repeated “we don’t serve egg whites because it would be wasting an egg.”

So much for offering good customer service.
I felt as though she at the very least could have asked the cook if they could prepare the egg whites, Debbie was adamant about not taking our request any further.
I wanted to go to “Country Waffles” on Midway ave.
But the people I was with, decided to stay.
Two stars due  Debbie’s demeanor.
No reflection on the great food at Perry’s.< /Review>< pics>

The French toast was good and the whole wheat pancakes were okay.  The coffee was weak and too easily sweetened.  Very busy place, so I am assuming we tried the wrong food.

Tasty food, great service. It’s not fancy by any means and not the absolute best breakfast I’ve ever had, but the portions were big, the prices reasonable, and the wait time low. It’s a little loud and definitely busy, but a great spot for a sit-down meal without the hassle.</Review>

<Review>Went there today (8-19-18) place was super busy and we were told about a 25 minute wait. Less than 25 minutes later we were seated. Lots to choose from on the menu, but I don’t eat eggs, so I settled for a waffle, side of bacon. Hubby had biscuits and gravy and a side of bacon. Probably some of the worst food I have had in a long time. The waffle was over cooked on one side and gummy on the other, my bacon? Tasted like burnt cardboard. Hubby’s biscuits were absolutely rock hard and the “gravy” was not freshly made. Hubby had been here before and raved about their food, I wasn’t impressed. Maybe the frittatas and omelette are what keep people coming back, but we will make sure that we don’t. ** the staff is amazing, but the food is less than desirable**< /Review><GmapID>0x80deaae66a57ce09:0xa4b7d84047ea47c6<//GmapID><rate>2< /rate>< Pictures>

<Review>Pretty good diner food. One of the few places in town that has a decent amount of parking. Don't expect gourmet food but the prices are very reasonable.</Review>< Pictures>

Literally is "best breakfast in town" like their sign says! Had the frittata with country potatoes and biscuits and gravy. So full! Great food, great prices and friendly service. There happened to be a birthday on our side of the restaurant and they got the whole area to sing for Valerie which was super nice. Love this place, highly recommend!</Review>

If you don't mind a very loud atmosphere while having your breakfast the food is good. Nothing to write home about but still good. Friendly staff and quick service. Prices aren't bad. Weekends are VERY busy, be ready to wait for awhile for a table.<//Review>

< Review>
We were visiting from Phoenix, Az and were looking for a good noncommercial breakfast spot. My cousin who lives in the area recommended Perry's.
We arrived around 12:30pm and when we pulled in there was a big group of people waiting outside! To most people, this would turn them away but I take this as a good sign!! More people = good food! It only took about 20 mins for our party of 5 to be seated.
Once we sat down we were greeted within minutes and our waitress took our drink order. She checked on us regularly to see if we were ready to order or if we had questions. I wish I remembered her name because she was very pleasant and attentive. Even on a very busy Sunday afternoon.
Now for the food... our table order 2 burgers, 2 pancake stacks, banana cakes, eggs and home fries. The easiest way to explain how good the good was, well.... I didn't get any pictures cause it was all gone before I could grab my phone lol! I got one of the burgers and it was a big juicy delicious burger. I couldn't help but sneak a bite of my son's pancakes and then I almost ate half of them haha. Some of the best pancakes I've had. The quality and quantity of each one of our plates was worth every minute waiting and every penny we spent. Come hungry, leave stuffed!
I definitely recommend this place! Sorry, no pictures.</Review>

I was turned on to Perry's Cafe by my husband now 30 years my husband when I first went there it was the hustle and bustle they had the one thing that I love they have regular waffles no Belgium which they do have but I don't eat them regular waffles I love that place everyone was friendly everyone was kind of service was quick and they always seem to have a smile for you you got to get there early though because it feels really really quickly or if you get there later just be prepared to wait maybe 20 minutes to get a table but it's worth the wait<//review>

<Text>This place was good. The breakfast food was very good and delicious. There was lots to choose from on the menu. It does however get very busy, so there is a bit of a wait on your food. The staff can sometimes be in their own world and can not here you speak to them as they walk past you multiple times. It does get very loud here and crowded. Id come here again, even with its minor issues.<//Text>< pictures>

I had the worst experience at this establishment. First I want to mention this is not the first time we've been here.

We asked to be seated in a larger table even though it was only the two of us when we signed in  (after waiting 15 min we reminded the manage) he refused to do that for us. He had us wait another 10 min. Even though there were empty tables.When I asked for his name he was hesitant and gave me the wrong name. After getting seated I asked our waitress and she gave use the correct name  Ernesto Lopez. (working Sunday, November 5 2017  )he was rude and used his title to to " show he was in charge. He needs to be RE-TRAINED and remember that the customer's "needs"  need to be address.. Personally I believe there needs to be a change in management.
If he can cook, put him in the back . He's definitely NOT a people's person.</Text>

If if you're searching for a place to sit down and have a hearty breakfast, you're going to want to check this place out. I have so many good things to say about this place. If I had to say one bad thing, though, it's that sometimes it's a bit too popular which can cause slightly extended waiting times. For any decent, reasonable human being though, this should not be too hard to overlook.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I have been a customer of Perry's for nearly 20 years now. Love this place, a true old school San Diego establishment. The food is not fancy, just your typical American diner food. Being in San Diego is has both standard American fare and Mexican food. Every breakfast plate can be ordered Mexican style with beans n tortillas instead of potatoes n toast. They recently remodeled the entire inside to bring the decor out of the 70's and the results are very good. This is a great spot for locals or visitors this fine city. Located across the street from the Old Towne Trollly stop, so it is easy to get to with or without a car. Be sure to check it out!</Text>

Great food and excellent customer service by Crystal B. She'll take care of you. She had several tables and still ensured that my family's food needs were met. We tipped her 40%.</review>

Retro Diner. Always stop by when in the Old Town area. Good section of Breakfast plates and always very filling. Walk over to Old Town to burn it all off.</review>

Old style metal upholstered chairs goes with the decor but not comfortable and can be noisy when moved around at busy time. Ate there midweek at 10am.< /Review>< Pictures>

'm a fan.
Whatever you order, you can rest assured knowing that it's A LOT of food. I ordered breakfast basics: Pecan Waffle, scrambled eggs, and bacon.  My friend ordered biscuits and gravy, scalloped fried potatoes, bacon and eggs and wasn't able to finish it. So of course I was happy to help!
Prices are relatively cheap and the service is extremely friendly!

Stayed at the Hilton on the previous night but upon waking one should ask him/her self. "Do I 'really' want to eat breakfast at the HIlton or should I try to experience a San Diego breakfast at a 'mom and pop' store elsewhere?" Answering that question correctly has the power to improve your experience.< /review>

Love it, the staff is ALWAYS friendly and the food is great.  The portions are enough for two, but if you're hungry down goes the entire meal.  No better place for the money.< /Review>

This place is great! Its like one of the trick stop diners you see in the movies. Its a little more modern but it still feels like walking into the past! They have the 4 people booths as well as the stools. They have a side section where they have tables with chairs that can be put together if you come with more people. The food is greatly priced and very tasty! We also really enjoyd the table service. They can have a bit of a long waite.</Review>

<Review>I took a lady friend to the Perrys in Old Town because she had never eaten there. She was very pleased with her meal, and I always enjoy breakfast at Perry's. I've eaten at Old Town and El Cajon and both have great food and great service. Keep it up Perry's!< /Review>< Pictures>

Homestyle food. Good service. Freeway close. I recommend the Mexican Frittata. Perry's has been a San Diego favorite for over 30 years. Its great tasting old style breakfast. They have a few healthy choices as well.< /Review>

Whenever I can't do without a great breakfast, I come to Perry's: 3 patty sausages, 2 eggs, almost more home-fries than I can eat, and a fresh-from-the-oven blueberry muffin.

< review>
I wanted to find a breakfast place that I could go to that would satisfy my breakfast urges.  I thought Perry's was going to be it.  The food was average.  There were so many frittatas to choose from.  There are also omelettes, french toast, pancakes.  Be careful, when they say strawberry or banana pancakes, that doesn't mean they are mixed in the batter.  The pancakes are just topped with the fruit.

A major concern that I had was the wait.  Start the stopwatch.. sit down at the table, place your order, wait for your food.  Stop the clock.  That was a little over an hour.  I'm not including the time that we waited to get our table.  We had a group of seven people, so there were more orders, but there were tables of five and six people, ordering after us and getting their food before us.

I was fine with the wait for the table, the place is popular.  But waiting over an hour to get our food once we've sat, is not acceptable to me.

This was my first visit, so I may be willing to give it one more shot.<//review>

Huge portions that were prepared correctly. The price is good for what you get. The wait can be long so make sure you get there early. We come here to eat whenever we visit San Diego.</Review>

Excellent food and big portions at reasonable prices.  Gets busy but for a reason, it's that good. Grab an empty seat at the bar for much quicker service. Love this place.<//Text>

Typical diner food, but not very flavorful. My waffle wasn't memorable except for the extreme amount of whip cream topping it. Decor is reminiscent of an elderly care facility.< /Review>

Food is ok but kind of high priced... $30 +tip for 2 breakfasts & 2 coffees. Usually pretty busy and always has loud ambient noise...  The waitstaff is attentive and quick to bring what you ask for.<//text>

<Review>This restaurant is not "retro" in the sense that it was styled in retro decorative fashion. It's original architecture. That is what makes it unique to the "throwback" diner themes that many would flock to. This is original architecture for this restaurant, and it you can't get that in today's cookie cutter Denny's franchises dotted thruout the U.S. On every freeway exit.

The food comes to you hot. Not lukewarm just barely served, but steaming off the griddle, and steam as in rich visible steam. The hash browns aren't just dumped from a box. They use a real old-fashion cast iron ironing iron to flatten out the hash browns to cook with. Hot fluffy eggs and actual pipping hot coffee. Awesomely fluffy pancakes.

This is not the diner you will see in the movies, this diner is best reserved for those that enjoy an excellent meal without all the movie tie-in nonsense of an IHOP or Denny's.< /Review></record>

<review>Not the Perry experience that I've had before.  First the I couldn't sit at a table like uwnted too (others were in there). Second, a waitress dropped a dish containing some salsa which splashed on both legs of my pants, mid-calf, my shoes and the pants on one of the people I was having lunch with.  She saw where it splashed, said she was sorry, but NEVER offered to help clean it off my pants or shoes.  I had I asked for extra napkins so I could clean it off my attire.  She saw me doing this but paid no attention to me. Sorry Perry's Cafe, but your staff let me down.  If the food would have been mediocre,  you'd have a 1-star rating.<//review>< Pics>

It's like stepping back in time to a great diner. They make the best breakfast in San Diego. Try the Frittata! No teenagers frying an egg here, most of the people who work there (including the cooking staff) have been there for 20-30 years. Long lines on weekends, but it moves fast. Very affordable.</text>

The food was delicious, we went on easter sunday and were seated quickly. The server was distracted and chatting with her friend (as I watched and entertained my BF by filling in the conversation)  most of the time, as we sat with empty cups for the majority of the meal which was not fun since we both ordered drinks with refills but that is not indicative of the quality of the establishment. I'm sure she was just having a day but it was a bit annoying.<//Review>

Didn't even get the opportunity to try the food. We asked if they did to go orders and were told no. Fair enough. We asked if we could sit and order and pack our food ourselves and were told "Noone would have time to pack our food". I'm not sure if the employee misunderstood, but his lazy mindset cost them business and cost us the opportunity to try an otherwise highly rated place. Bummer.

*Just went to Dennys and got a quick carryout order. The host was very helpful and helped us substitute some special requests in the most inexpensive way possible. Customer Service 5/5.</Review>

<Review>The frittatas for breakfast were fabulous and very filling. I had the Deluxe Frittata and it was great. Quick service at the counter so we didn’t have to wait. Wonderful choice for a reasonably priced breakfast in Old Town San Diego. It’s not that pricy for a great meal!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The food was fine but the service was God awful. We all needed to use the bathroom, so we stepped away for maybe five or six minutes and they threw all the food away! I asked if we could have  our food made again, they said no! Asked for a refund again, No! They at least let my son have his hat back that they stole from the table. I Will never go here again, wouldn't recommend if you have children.< /Text>

<Text>My friend April suggested we go to Perry's, as she had never been, and always wanted to have breakfast there. I had been once with my daughter, a year prior, and the food was standard diner fare. So we went, with her adorable 9 mo. old baby in tow. Jack is eminently good natured, and on this particular occasion was finding his voice, and making gleeful shrieking sounds. About 15 min. into our breakfast experience, having ordered and gotten coffee, a gruff older man, a customer on his way up to the cashier, rudely told us that is we couldnt control the baby, we should leave the restaurant. This began an unruly, and fairly loud, exchange between the man and myself. As he walked away, leaving us shocked, yet another customer, also an older man, told us we should leave. My friend April was reduced to tears, and I was outraged. She wanted to leave immediately, and explained this to our server, who made no effort to console her or stop us from leaving. The manager  on site was evidently oblivious to the entire incident. Because I did not want to further distress my friend, I left quietly with her. But I am dismayed and disgusted by the whole experience. Apparently Perry's is not a family friendly establishment, but a place for crusty old people to dine without being bothered by the joyful sounds of happy babies. I can say from previous experience that the food here is average. The menu is exactly what you would expect. The staff, patrons, and environment were an abysmal experience, and I would recommend Perry's to no one.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>I don't understand the crowds, the food is less than average.  The last time we were there the eggs were crispy and the sausage was under cooked.  We told the manager, he said he would talk to the cook and never did, nor did he bring us decent food to replace it.</Text>< Pictures>

We were just starting to google a search for a nice place to go for breakfast. As we rounded the corner off Taylor St., there is was in huge letters: "The Breakfast Place", almost like divine intervention! The service was very friendly, engaging, and attentive! Nicole was our server. Even though it was our first time there, she made us feel like we were long time, favorite customers. She described the food and portions, which the restaurant is known for. The menu was unique with unusual, but VERY tasty options, in additional to traditional breakfast choices. The atmosphere was a quaint time capsule out of the 70's, but fit just right! We got our food pretty fast, even though it was fairy busy. I wanted to customize my fritatta order with some extra ingredients to compliment the fantastic original recipe. Anything goes, and Nicole added the goodies! The coffee was fresh and VERY good! Our orders came and we were amazed! Huge portions and absolutely delicious, just as Nicole had described! She brought us extra napkins, and we blasted off into breakfast bliss! We will DEFINITELY make Perry's Cafe a gotta have it destination on our next trip to San Diego!

<Review>They boast having the best breakfast in town and it is clearly not.  Our waitress was rude. Seemed like she did not want to wait on us at all and completely messed up our orders.
At one point she sets a plate down on our table and start looking at each other wondering  who the plate belongs to. My sister puts it in front of her because it's the closest thing that resembles what she ordered so she starts to pick at it, and then our rude waitress rushes over to our table and takes the plate away.
No apologies, all she said that this wasn't for this table, takes it away and we see her take it to a booth 3 tables down from us and apologizes to the and hands it to a person sitting there (after we had picked at it).< /Review>< pictures>

Great price, great food, excellent service. The place is always buzzing with people, a sure fire sign its a rocking joint. The entire inside looks like it was built in the 60s, this isnt a negative as it has been extremely well maintained giving it a great atmosphere. The kitchen is open and in view and the cooking staff is very well kept and maintained. The food selection is very wide and for the price you cannot beat it. The coffee is always hot and has a great taste. All in all I highly recommend this place as one of the hidden gems of san diego.<//text>

<review>My family loves Perry's Cafe!  My mouth waters for the Mexican Frittatas.  Unfortunately, the service has gone downhill in the past few years.  The El Cajon Branch has the same food with better service.<//review><GmapID>0x80deaae66a57ce09:0xa4b7d84047ea47c6<//GmapID></record>

<Text>We have been coming here for many years. Lived in El Cajon and used to go to that one there. That was sold and have been going to the Perry's near Old Town everytime I visit San Diego since I moved to Fresno in 1991. My wife and I always share a frittata breakfast with country fries and biscuits and gravy. We still have leftovers to take away. Highly recommended.< /Text></record>

<text>Excellent place for breakfast and as stated by others always busy, but gets 'em in and out.  Local vibe as well with many retired military locals making up a big part of their clientele.  Visitors should consider this over the usual tourist spots like Richard walker or Hash a go go. Will save many $$ and will get you uptown to discover Oldtown as well.  Breakfast at Perrys and a walk thru Oldtown...Sounds like a great morning in san diego! Highly recommended and you can trolley back downtown to enjoy what downtown san diego has to offer.<//text><gmap_id>0x80deaae66a57ce09:0xa4b7d84047ea47c6< /gmap_id>< pictures>

UPDATE 8/18 - Someone must have paid attention, because, except for the weird men's room layout, everything seems to be fixed. The potatoes are great, waitstaff seem to be on track, and all's right in the universe! Nice to see a great breakfast joint actually respond to their customers. Updated to four stars, back in my breakfast rotation.

--------------

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting different results. Eating here repeatedly, with modest expectations, qualifies me for the rubber room. Awful food, server couldn't remember what planet she was on, let alone how to serve the meal... can't emphasize enough the poor food quality. Potatoes sit on the grill, burning in their predecessor's carbon, imparting a burnt, unhealthy flavor to what gets served. Carne asada was like shoe leather, and the 'ranchero sauce' was some rendition of celery, onion, and tomato, simmered on a warmer. Nothing fresh about any of it.

Too bad, because before the owner passed, they were a really decent breakfast house. Now, suitable for the locals who don't know any better. Feh.

Oh, yeah. In the men's room, the urinal is right next to the sink, where, hopefully, some folks wash their hands. THERE IS NO PARTITION/BARRIER, so you are literally looking right at the bowl when using the sink, and whatever dangly bits may be availing of same. Disgusting is too kind a word for this...just a simple metal partition is apparently too much to ask. Attn: health department.

There are a few good servers there - and I'll miss them...done with this joint.< /Text>

We're from out of town, so we were just looking for a quick cafe place to grab breakfast at. Google maps says "known for their breakfast" for Perrys Cafe so we gave it a shot.

Staff wasn't very friendly. The guy who seated us greeted us with a smile to start and simply walked away grumbling something when we got to the table.

The prices were pretty high as well for a cafe. My wife got steak and eggs for $12.50, which isn't bad. I ordered from the al a carte menu 2 eggs for $3.50, bacon for $3.75, and a bowl of oatmeal for $3.25. See the prices I expected some decent food. The bacon was burnt when it came out, and the oatmeal seems to have been pulled from a huge pot that sits all morning. I wasn't expecting 5 star, but if you are going to charge $1 for a piece of bacon, at least cook it right. Very unhappy with our trip there.<//review>

<Text>Perry's Cafe has been serving San Diego for as long as I can remember.  My last memory at this location on Pacific Hwy. I was enjoying a stack of pancakes with my belated Father, over 30 years ago.
Today I decided to order #M9, Benedict A La Mexican, two poached eggs atop a tortilla with ham or Canadian bacon, ham today, covered with salsa ranchera.  It's Amazing!!! Moistest ham I've had in literally years and the ranchera sauce is all it's own!!  The flavor of the ranchera salsa is hands down my favorite,  and I've had many a ranchero salsa in my day. Bell peppers, celery, onion, tomatoes in a very non acidic base just amazed my taste buds.  So please try the M9, and the pancakes are still delicious too!!  Special thanks to Carmen, our server, for her genuine smile and lovely service!< /Text>< Pictures>

I ordered fruit with my frittata, and it was two canned peach halves and two canned pear halves. What kind of place serves canned fruit as a side of fruit?  The service was ok.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

One of my favorite breakfast places in SD. Be prepared to wait for 10-20 minutes, but the place is large so the line moves pretty quickly. Many good options for food, I have only ordered breakfast.<//text>

The food was cold, I was never acknowledged, nor I was ever approached to my table to see if I need it anything. I had to yell across the room to get service and the server was busy at all times with other customers. I will never come to this place again. I felt I was overcharged too.... For 3 adults and 1 kid I was charged 60 dollars. On top of that I was never offer an apology or a discount.</Text>< pictures>

Went with a group of eight and although I am not big on greasy spoon restaurants, we had out of town visitors that wanted exactly that, so we gave Perry's a try.  I ordered the Mexican eggs benedict, which were Aweful!  Canadian bacon was over cooked and dry, not worth cutting into, the sauce was out of a can or bottle, but definitely not a good tasting one.  I asked for hashbrowns instead of beans and those were decent.  The best part of my dish was probably the eggs, but had to clean as much of the sauce off as possible.  The waitress was nice, but busy and got my husband's tortillas wrong.  He describes his meal as ok, but wouldn't order it again.  If you are going to serve mexican food in San Diego, it should be at the very least decent.</text>

< review>
Went ther today, It's been awhile... (we usually like to make breakfast at home) and I keep forgetting about the place. Anyway.. I had the spinach, bacon, mushroom fritatta, and my wife had the mexican fritatta (macha). Cut them in half and had a great breakfast. Ordered the home fries, which were good but could have used some additions.. like onions and chilies.. I asked if they had good sourdough and was told "not so much" so I got the blueberry muffins.... I don't know what they were thinking or if today was normal, but they were the worst.. My first bite just turned to dough in my mouth.. had to spit it out. But... I will definatly go back... just avoid the muffins ;O)

They had me wait one hour for my food i got it it was not hot it was like it sat under a warmer so then i had them take back the plates to remake and they popped em in a microwave and brought it out the only way i knew it was microwaved cause my waffle turned rubber so when i told them that was mean how they popped it in the microwave the manager told me "so and what else are you gunna complain about" and yet all i was trying to do is buy some damn breakfast looks like they ruined it for me going there again< /text>
