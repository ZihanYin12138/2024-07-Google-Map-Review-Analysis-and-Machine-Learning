So glad to have The Richmond springing back to life (reservations for indoor dining)! Don’t get me wrong, they’ve been serving a delicious takeout burger for months, but the real experience is onsite dining.< /text>

The takeout burger and fry combo was amazing. One of the best burgers I’ve ever had. The chefs were so kind and clearly talented. We will be back as regulars.< /Text>

Simple the best burger in the world!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I can tell the owner is very dedicated to offer high quality food even though it is for delivery.  The meat they used is of the highest quality.  And I like that the onion is cooked.  Best yet, the bun is home made!  Usually you have have to order at least 45 minutes in advance because they are so popular.  😋<//Text>

They've started doing take-out burgers during Covid, and they're amazing. Comes with fries for a flat $15 and worth every penny. Cash only for now.< /Review>

<text>Sat outside in the patio. Ordered the seafood paella and sangria. Nothing better. Great atmosphere. Because the paella took a little longer than usual, the waiter brought out some fries on the house, and these were ordinary fries. These were special fries. So good.</text>< pictures>

Super friendly family seems to own + run the place. Absolutely top notch meals + wine experience before COVID. Since, they've converted to selling burger/fries/drinks to go since, and of course, the burger is ridiculously good. Support this place, highly recommend.</review>< pics>

<review>The experience is what makes this restaurant 5 stars. There are less than 10 tables, which provides a very intimate experience. Everyone must do a tasting menu as there are NO a la carte options. However, the 3 course tasting menu is less that $40 a person, which is likely the best price you’ll get in the city. There is also a wine tasting that you can add on. All of the meat and fish dishes were cooked perfectly. Would highly recommend the duck entree, the chicken entree, and the apple crisp for dessert.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBOOmfIONCbH9rQxJ5M_ZcfvtmIOuZNz0VEe8-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtZzfFGyk-MaYGQlefZhPoDvKiWojwytn3p1gT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPN7_wLMVwUUQNHjPDJx4xwUxNI5eC8lSltQrst=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I loooove this hidden gem! I can’t believe I’ve never heard of or been to this restaurant till now. I think it’s run by a couple and I love the personal touches. The chef is amazing - he takes your order, pours and explains the wine, and comes out to explain each course. You can choose between 3 or 5 course and a wine pairing with your meal. We did the 5 course with the wine pairing. The food was delicious and each course was nicely spaced. The wine was sooo good, and the pours were incredibly generous. We also added the corn bread pudding which was on the 3 course menu as an a la cart and that was one of my favorite dishes. The foie gras was also perfectly balanced and excellent. Definitely come here for a special, personal experience.<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>We bought this restaurant out one night for a family get-together! The intimate restaurant was a perfect fit for our 36 person party. The Chef, John, was very accommodating and helped us pre-plan a menu for the night. All the dishes were fantastic but these are the ones you MUST GET:

Crab Cake: 5/5
Crispy exterior and moist meaty interior. It was perfect!

Red Wine Braised Short Rib w/ Maine Diver Scallop: 5/5 [Best Dish]
Scallop was perfectly seared and not overcooked. Short Rib melts in your mouth and explodes with flavor. The creamy polenta was decent but I would rather have creamy mashed potatoes.< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMz30wvxpnPaW-jeBxtSNoIcCyMKv16l3m0DZDA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZpBxT8mrif-n5EVcn_1jcmb-m-hpFE-CkZbze=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPi5ik94jVQr_qKD1FM7WBCYU0mQ0syjBf2uppH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOv84-2VKm0mqOFMSQYkDHtm8Vhp74igEfIURCn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Personalized service that one would not expect to find in a small town these days, let alone San Francisco. Excellent food with superb wine pairing. The owner, John, really made us feel welcome and we lived his relaxed attitude with a sharp focus on quality. One of the most rewarding dining experiences we've had!< /text>

New favorite place!  Owner/chef John has created a gorgeous tasting menu with wine pairings.  Three course price fixe, incredibly reasonable ($40 pp) in an overpriced city.  When we couldn’t decide between the shrimp fritter with shrimp bisque or crab cake with shaved squash salad, John brought us both.  Generous flow of well-selected wines.  Each dining table is private, noise level is wonderfully conducive to conversation, and service is personal and attentive.< /Review>

<review>Top notch appetizer, great main course and excellent dessert, all for a very very reasonable price.

Dining room setting is quite private, and very comfortable.

The owner is also the chef, and he takes the order himself. Very friendly.

No wonder it is rated as one of the 10 best restaurants in the Bay Area.

I recommend The Richmond highly.< /review>< Pictures>

This used to be a great restaurant with good food, good affordable wine and a friendly staff. They've changed to a prix fix menu and the food is quite heavy. The owner is flexible if you have dietary restrictions which is good. The wine is still affordable and there is a wide selection. Overall, I probably won't return but it is at least worth a visit.</Text>

This charming neighborhood gem has been here for many years. We come here quite often. We enjoy the privacy, very quiet, good food and interesting menu, good service although sometimes a little slow. The prices are very reasonable. Although they could cut down the generous servings and you still wouldn't go home hungry.</text>

Great place. The food is fantastic and the owner makes you feel like you're eating in his own home.  Love that they keep the wine flowing and always show guests an awesome time.  They also have a fantastic curated wine selection.</Text>

<review>Fine dining without being over priced.  Excellent service with one of the best ducks ever.  Catered to my food allergies as well!

<Date>1364075388671</Date><Rating>4<//Rating><review>Possibly the best tasting menu restaurant you'll find in this city.  The only reason why it's so inexpensive is because it's in the Richmond.  Wine pairing for $25!!! Unheard of.  Do need to make reservation because space is very limited, but it's worth your while.<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x8085873f618f1fff:0x55ab36ff8398de7a<//Gmap_id></record>

Great selection of reasonably priced wine and delicious food. The pasta bolognese made me want to lick my plate and ask for more. The staff is very nice and welcoming. Great neighborhood restaurant. I would definitely return.< /text>

I haven't eaten here but went one evening for a glass of wine, the staff was very attentive and knowledgable in the wine and food menu. We watched a table do a 5 course tasting paired with wine and were very impressed in the presentation and the knowledge of the staff. They were still very attentive to us even though we were just having wine!</text>

<Review>I went to The Richmond for a special occasion dinner and we were not let down. Nestled in the Inner Richmond next to a laundry mat isn't where one would expect to find fine dining, but The Richmond delivers. It's a small staff with the owner also working as waiter, chef, sommelier and just about anything else you could need. We had the three course tasting menu. I started with crab cakes and spinach salad which were excellent and paired with a light, crisp white. Next came duck leg with veggies and mashed potatoes paired with a GSM. Both were exceptionally prepared, presented and paired. For dessert I had the apple cobbler. Light, crisp and paired with a port, it was the perfect compliment to the meal. I highly recommend The Richmond to anyone who hasn't tried it. Somewhat pricey but very reasonable for the food and service you get. Meals are quick so expect to spent a few hours on a multi course meal.<//Review>< date>

If you want the full “Target Experience” do not come here. Employees are many times lifeless with no interest in assisting customers. Pretty small store to say the least. If you need a few items in a hurry than it’s decent enough for that.<//review>

I love targets, really my “go to” store. But I came to this target and sooooo many customers were without masks. Its still mandatory to wear one so I’m not sure why this store was not enforcing the rule? Lack of management? Don’t know but they need to protect their workers and the rest of the customers by making EVERYONE wear a mask.< /text>

Essentially a mini Target with a little bit of everything a full sized target would have. It's definitely smaller than the average Target; Upside: it's easy to navigate, Downside: limited product. However, they have all the basics covered from the fresh market, to CVS pharmacy, and of course, a Starbucks. Check out can get hectic during peak times due to less checkout stands but the same can be said of a regular Target: more product, more people, more check out stands, peak times will always be busy. I recommend checking the Target App to see if your product is available at this location before venturing out.< /text>

While it feels smaller it has most of the same things a bigger target has
I don't care for the layout a little confusing as far as where they stuck certain things but all in all it's good for shopping<//Text>

Ordered online 6 pc of one item for pick up. Got email & app said it was ready for pick up. Got to the store and they only had 1 pc of the item ready, said they ran out, but if I looked in store they might have more. Go look, there's a lot in stock. I pick up 4 more, go to the self register, guy there only let me buy one cause there's only a limit of 1.

1. Why did the app have a limit of 6 if the limit is 1?

2. Why not cancel my whole order or at least communicate before I drive there?

3. Why didn't the person at pick-up explain that the reason they had only 1 ready was because it's the limit? I don't know if I should blame her, probably some manager told her to tell me that, since she hinted I could buy more in-store if I looked.

Wasting my time & gas for no reason, at least should have let me complete my order that one time.< /text>

< Review>
almost every isle was blocked by boxes. very inconvenient, couldn't even get the cart thru most isles. its a good store. great location....but shouldn't block the isles making it difficult to shop. and no one was "stocking shelves " so that made my first shopping experience at this target not so great.</Review>

The worst customer service. Employees are rude and drag their feet when asked for help. Store is small but has enough. Kids clothes are pretty empty. Nice Small clearance  Section. Won’t be returning here because of the customer service. Redondo and Manhattan beach location are always very pleasant!</Review>

Absolutely an adorable mini Target. I was very surprised to see that they were able to fit all my favorite departments into such a small area love this and it’s location. I will be doing a lot of shopping here, of course as far as grocery shopping Superior still has the best prices.<//text>

<text>The employees are very rude and have no customer service. She was irritated very easily just by asking a simple question. The store is simple and small, no big deal. The employees are no help, they don't know where the items are at, had to ask multiple employees to find a certain item. have no customer service. disappointed!</text>< Rating>

<Review>I applied for a position at this target location in Lawndale but I will not be applying again. I thought I did a great job on the interview but guy was rude and the lady she walked away in between my interview. The employees working there are scruffy and are rude everytime I have been there to shop no one never ask for help and customer service is bad and target is horribly small and the hiring manager lied to me about getting back to me the same. Mind you I have the experience I was able to do the job with no restrictions and yes. I would not recommend for applying for a job at this target location nor shopping.<//Review>< GmapID>

Was a nice experience have a dinner in the parking lot at the time that employees was closing the store a 10:00pm. Watching the Target team doing "Go back", attending last costumers, and Security guard picking the shopping carts.
Like a said that was a buetiful experience!
Thanks for bring this new store to our the beautiful City of Hawthorne. 🤗<//Text>

I found a clearance item and when I got to the register she said that wasn’t the price it was actually more. Labeling and pricing has absolutely nothing to do with me but the workers! So the girl asks her manager I’m guessing should she honor it?! Meaning there is an option to honor a mistake that has absolutely nothing to do with me. The manager Tanae or whatever her name is comes over and says no bc it can just be mislabeling. AGAIN! Nothing to do with me!!! I asked her if she had the option to honor it being that it had nothing to do with me, she said no when the register girl just asked meaning there was a way around it.   It should have been honored. & I will be calling Target corporate to complain.</Text>

<Review>Very rude employees. I was paying with a gift card, and the computer screen showing "how much do you want on gift card" but the cashier is inputing the PIN code of the gift card instead. So I told her to put 20 and I'll pay the rest with cash, then she stood up (yes, she was sitting) and start giving me attitude and saying I don't tell her how she should do her job. I decided to cancel the transaction and start walking away. Her manager walks in and I heard the cashier talking about me and said i was telling her how to do her job, so i walk back and said excuse me, but instead of letting me speak and ask me what happened, the manager said hold up you already  left and I'm talking to her (cashier) and i taught them to tell customers not tell them how to do their job. I was expecting she would at least  ask me what happened but no, the manger was also rude! If i can only give 0 star, i would!!< /Review><user_name>jen ortiz< /user_name><UserId.>117973434265095870720</UserId.>< rating>

This is the worst Target I've ever been too. No one is ever in the register. There's always a huge line at the self checkout. Theres plenty of employees and not one of are helping. I even saw an old lady that had alot of stuff that asked for assistance and was sent to the self checkout.< /Review>

<review>Terrible location; avoid if you can. The atmosphere made me feel like I was shopping at Walmart. It seems the staff doesn't really respect the shoppers, possibly because they might experience a lot of criminal activities or maybe their general attitude manifests negativity, either way I'm happy I don't have to come back here. I only went to this location because they had the game I was looking for and the 3 closest to me didn’t and it was 9:30pm on Christmas Eve so my choices were slim</review>< Resp>

<Text>Morning community of Lawndale and neighboring cities.
I've read some of the very harsh reviews related to the new mini Target located at Hawthorne Blvd and Rosecrans.
While I havent had the experience of shopping there as of yet.I'm most definitely going to support this retailer.
Target a major brand has made a commitment in bringing a big name chain store to Lawndale and that should be appreciated in my mind.
I completely understand unacceptable service but with all due respect let's give the staff at this location an opportunity to get up to speed folks.
I'll be pulling into this Target today and If I notice any of the negatives that were listed in the comments, I myself will be contacting Target corporate offices.
Again these are the  young adults,parents,elders of our community being employed.
I'm in no way associated with the Target brand just a local citizen of the community.

Kind regards

The whole point of a store like Target is that I can go there for multiple things. This place doesn't have multiple things, it's got a very limited selection.< /Review><resp>None< /resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< UserId.>

Tech employees playing gross ratchet music with little kids in the store. No wonder they didn’t want to build a Target here.< /Review>

Realmente mala  a excepción de las personas que están en las cajas no mee agrado la forma que tratan a la gente, estaba comprando y se acercó el tiempo de cierre un empleada paso y mencionó a otro empleado que se asegurara que no me quedara, diciéndome que abandone el lugar por que es hora de cerrar, no paso ni 30 segundos cuando me repite el mismo discurso yo llegue con la ilusión de comprar ciertas cosas que faltan el mi baño pero con esa actitud con que toman los empleados prefiero comprar los mismos productos en otro lugar.

I can't say enough about how amazing this store is. Their "brand ideology" is of ultimate giving. They turn nearly all of their proceeds back into the community they exist in.
I have found so many great deals there and in turn have donated exclusively back to them.
I cannot say how much i appreciate the work they do.</Review>

Not sure if it just the location but the actually have nice stuff! A good selection of clothes for men and women, although I’m a little bummed that there isn’t a book/movie section. The Halloween costumes they make for the storefront are absolutely beautiful</review>

<text>It's also a wonderful experience to browse Out of the Closet, particularly the one located on Santa Monica Blvd, a couple blocks east of Crescent Heights. There you're sure to find an item of clothing, well-worn jeans..a gently worn t-shirt or jacket, a room full of hardbound + paperback books of all sorts...and the occasional lamp, end table or paper weight that you can't bear to pass up.  Prices range from very reasonable, to a down right incredibly giveaway rate.
If you are lucky you may find be a member of their sales staff who's even willing to bargain with you, especially if the item of your desire had been on the shelf 3-4 weeks or more (they keep track.) ********
Definitely worth a visit.  And a large part of their profits $$$ --minus salaries-- of
course--goes to HIV and community charities.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Pros: 10% senior discount and bonus points you can accrue with each purchase. Free parking in back. Friendly staff. Cons: selling fewer books and more bric a brac. There's also one particular employee that has consustently refused books and other donations from me repeatedly even though my items are saleable! So I'm donating to Goodwill and Council Thrift from now on, though I will continue to shop at the Weho store.<//review>

They use to have a lot of good stuff but I got a tip from one of the workers that some of the employees are stealing all the good stuff and keeping it for them selfs. It sucks because the store looses money and you see less shoppers because all the good stuff is gone.</Text>

<Text>Been here numerous times. It's better then sunset but their Long beach is better.  Still wasn't greeted or asked for help.  I saw a great dress but not for $15. Got have almost that same dress else were for $6. I have gotten some great things from here.  Dog friendly.  Saw 3 dogs inside. Had 50% off all shoes and go figure a few pairs I actually liked were too small for me.  Clean and organized.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

5 stars for what they do and five stars for just being them! Love Out of the Closet and love how it is a sign of belonging to so many. I donate to the one in Wilton Manors and shop at all the ones across the country including this one. Great job! #weho #hollywood #outofthecloset #thriftstore<//text>

<Text>This place is way too trashy to be in WeHo. The staff was incredibly rude and need a lesson in business and customer service. I walked in 15-20 minutes before closing and no one said anything to me about a closing time, not even when I brought an arms full of dresses to the dressing room. It wasn't until they literally shouted, yes shouted, at me while I was in the dressing room that I had to leave in 2 minutes. I got dressed and quickly left. I will never be back to any out of the closet stores; I would suggest you don't waste your time and do the same. A first time guest should always be treated with respect. No one said a word at all to me until they wanted me out of the store, well mission accomplished you will never see me there again.<//Text><user_name>Amanda Kaley</user_name>< pics>

I checked & Out of the Closet Thrift Store contributes 96% of every dollar to helping people living w/AIDS. I'm bringing them a lot of #OneLifetoLive #Dorian wardrobe & some of my personal stuff BECAUSE it just makes good sense--doesn't it? besides I was a size 4 in those vintage days LOL

<rating>5</rating><Review>(Translated by Google) Great place. Item in very very good condition and very inexpensive compared to other second-hand clothes.
We bought music CDs 2 for $ 1, a vans shirt for $ 5 and high-waisted skinny jeans for $ 12 all without tax.
The people who work there are friendly and professional.
I highly recommend!

Les personnes qui y travaillent sont aimables et pro.
Je recommande vivement!</Review>< pictures>

<Text>We have had a great experience with them! We've been three times now and have a fourth and fifth coming up. I'm 37 and just got my first tattoos with them. My first ones were simple ones, an alien and a moon on my hands. The second one was the archangel, Michael, on my neck. Anthony did the ones on my hands and popped that cherry lol. Scott did the one on my neck. Both sessions came out great. Scott sat down and talked with me for 30 minutes and wanted to make sure I had thought things through before blasting my neck right away. Shows me he had integrity. At the end of the day, I decided to go for it. Great experience. Thanks again guys! See you soon!<//Text>< pics>

On Feb. 3rd Anthony far exceeded my expectations. I never received such respect from any artist who has worked on me. The environment was great, staff was curtious professional and above all, respectful. I will be coming back one day. Thanks again!!!</Text>

<text>The shop looked pretty cool. The interior is nicely decorated and has a homely vibe.
I went into the shop to check out some portfolios and I was met with Scott.
He was nice and professional and his portfolio was nice.  His work has a lot of realistic animals that looked really good. I just couldn't go with the shop because I was a little intimidated after seeing a portrait of what seemed to be Adolf Hitler on the last page of his portfolio. No one was racist towards me during my visit but I just did not feel comfortable after that.< /text><pics>None< /pics><Date>1566427558048</Date><Rate>4<//Rate></record>

My go to tattoo shop. Everyone is friendly and nice. Absolutely love my work.
Tattoos aren't for everyone, especially if you're a sensitive, whiny wimp.
I love this place and will continue to go back.<//Review>

By far one of my favorite tattoo shops. My battle buddies and I came in around 2000 from Fort Irwin as walk ins and they tatted all of us. My artist was Alberto and he did two tattoos on me, both came out amazing. The shop was clean, the atmosphere was friendly and they honestly made my night. I would definitely recommend to anyone to go here and I definitely am coming back in the few years I’m stationed here. Not to mention the work they do is beautiful.</Text>

I had a cross that was done poorly by another artist at a dirrerent shop down the hill and Chris Burnett did a great job fixing it up to make it look a lot better than it did. He is a great guy and a family man too. I highly recommend him.<//text>

He was very gentle while tatooing me and although it hurt, it was worth the pain. (Heck yea!!) For being such a young artist, he’s very talented. He will go far. I wish him nothing but immense success. Keep up the great work guys and continue to encourage each other...just like Scott, his dad was with Mike that night. 👍🙂<//review>< Pictures>

They were right on it the second I walked in, answered my questions, suggested which artists would be best for the style I wanted, and gave me each artists work to look at to make my own decision. After looking at the different artists work, which were all great, I went with Scott G. and a great choice it was, he was very attentive to detail, and really made the tattoo I wanted unique. Even touched up on an older tattoo I had to really make my overall chest look great.

Definitely going back for my next piece!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Horrible experience. I went with my best friend while I was down visiting her to get tattoos to mark our 20 year friendship. I told her I did not want to get tattoo by 2 different people but that's all they offered us, my best friends tattoo is so nice and the needle work was thin and girly. Mine on the other hand the guy used a bigger needle so mine looks much thicker, and the ink looks like it bleed under my skin while her didnt, then the next day it was extremely sore, very very red and oozing ink and liquid. A week later my leg is still warm to the touch, very red and infected. My dr now has me on antibiotics. The guy assured me the needle he was using was clean but he had it out before I got in the room because I had walked out to see the placement of my friends to see if hers was ok. Her tattoo artist Joe I would go back to the guy who did mine Chris horrible work and gave me an infection.</review>

We will look into this more to make sure it is more clear in the future so there is no confusion. Glad the tattoo came out well.'}</Response>

I had heard and read great things about this place but my experience was poor. I was charged $60 for a very small wrist tattoo. Definitely a bit of a rip off. This was my first tattoo and I was not at all told what to expect with its healing process. I was sent away with it bleeding and had to turn and come back and ask for it to be wrapped. The tattoo came out good, but I will definitely not be coming back to this place.</Text>

<time>1496197554295< /time><rate>1</rate><review>Horrible experience, bad customer service. The guys in the shop were talking about how they were partying in the shop until 6 am the night before. And how they already had to cancel their 10am appointment. I wish now we had taken that slot and saved ourselves the misery. We were asked to sign paperwork before even seeing a design.  The men working were saying really derogatory things about women. When one of us changed her mind, Albert was rude. We even tipped him after the first tattoo because I still wanted something done. This was supposed to be an experience for us and our was ruined by an employee's poor attitude and poor tattoo skills, frankly. The things we were asking of him were not impossible. It is not impossible to so small detail. And it's not impossible to tattoo a friggin' pineapple. And when your day is booked for 3 tattoos and one cancels...how does that mean you no longer have time to do the 2nd one? 0 star review

**edited to say:
I did not get tattooed. I was turned away because the artist "didn't have time." I live out of state and just wanted a tattoo with my cousins while visiting.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1495829621021, 'text': 'Sorry you were not happy. We stand on the size and placement no matter what you think he can do. The pineapple would of taken longer he came in to do 3 small shark teeth. He had to pick up his son at a certain time and to miss that would not be right. Again sorry you are not happy, we seen your post on Facebook about how much you loved your tattoo. So at least you were happy with the tattoo. As for the being hungover this is completely out of context. I explain that as I believe your uncle wrote the last review. Which he never has been our business. AGAIN SORRY you were not happy with the service. The tattoo looks amazing because he moved it. Good thing is you never have to come in here again.

<text>The place was clean and the staff was  friendly but the tattoos i got are horrible. I got some stuff on my hands.  The ink stained my knuckle and is all black around the tattoo.  The words looked good at first but after a little healing looks like I tried to do it myself. I will have to either pay someone to try to fix the letters or get then all lasered off. By far the worst tattoo I have ever recieved in a Profesional shop.

The owner reached out to me and made it right.  Chris redid the tattoos and they are 100 times better.< /text>< Pictures>

First and foremost we want to make it clear that we always look to support and serve each client the best we can.

If you would let us, please come in and we would like to refund your money and even re-do the tattoo.  This is Chris Burnett, the owner.\n\nThank you and have a great evening.'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Worst most unprofessional Tattoo shop Inhave ever experienced. I went in with 2 friends for Friday the 13 th tattoos and wrote our names in the list mind you this was before 8:30 we waited patiently as we noticed the lady with purple leggings and gray shirt letting everyone that got there after us go before us. We let it slide 4 times and when she let the 5th person go before us we decided to get up and walk out. I get that it’s a lot of people but you couldave been nice enough to say hey these people are friends so I will keep letting them cut in front of you. We would ave left happy but unfortunately the old lhag decided to skip us multiple times I will not reacomend anyone and my friends will not either. Thanks but no thanks<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>
{'time': 1508179765539, 'text': 'Sorry you feel like that. But let me clarify some things. 1 we did not have a list of name we took release forms so I don’t know where you get you had your name on a list?  The wait durning the evening time was about 3 hours or more, it was extremely busy as we did 408 tattoos in one day. The lady with purple leggings and grey shirt had nothing to do with us. In fact she had nothing to do with order or operation on Friday the 13 or ever at Dinamik Tattoo at any time. I have reviewed our cameras and not sure if I seen the same thing you described. You are more than welcome to come look at the video with us.  If you filled out a release form around 8:30 you would of been tattooed that day around 11 pm. Again sorry you did not see the same thing we did as we tried to make a cool experience for everyone on Friday the 13. Good thing there are plenty of other shop to fill your needs. Thanks Chris Burnett.'}</Resp>

<review>Obviously you are insistent that i remove my review. I did... but my rating stands. You harass ppl to improve peoples opinion.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1495063936789, 'text': "First off the word tattoo is spelled with 3t's. Second is you have never been in my business, so confused how to reply to this review as this is second hand. Albert was not hungover. The moving the tattoo and size was for her best. Where she wanted it it would of not held. The size was enlarged so that the tattoo would maintain over time. By changing the placement and size actually was the best call. I can go around and around on the ideal he was not giving the best experience. At that point I would have to see what your experience and knowledge of what we do is. Being it was her first tattoo, it would be easy to say there would be little or no knowledge of what to experience. I am very confused on why if it was so bad on service but tattoo looks amazing enough to tip at the end of he tattoo.  Again this would have to be discussed with her as she was the one receiving the tattoo. Any more questions we can go over them in person."}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

They almost crashed into me.   Called to let them know.  They just said. “So”.     It’s cool.  I guess I’ll just “so” with a one star then

< Review>
I just had an awesome experience with Hadley Tow in Costa Mesa.  I needed a new battery for my car and called AAA.  Mina Shay from Hadley Tow responded.  Turns out, my battery wasn’t available.  Instead of just saying that they were out, he made a few phone calls to find one.  He drove to pick it up and came back a short while later.  Not everyone goes above and beyond like that and it really makes the difference.  Thanks again, Mina.  You are outstanding and provided amazing customer service.<//Review>

Just had my truck towed by Tony J. Best service I have ever received from any tow company. He picked up my truck ahead of schedule from what AAA told me. Had my truck dropped off exactly when he said he would be there. Amazing service with an outstanding personality. He even waited with me 5 mins to make sure my ride showed up.< /Review>

Triple A was confused and could not get it together. Hadley had the right Truck to tow the BMW 525i safely.  I now have Hadley on speed dial. Excellent customer service, rapid deployment and a sharp driver. Again I have them on speed dial.<//review>

Deshawn of Hadley Tow towed our vintage 1963 car from Costa Mesa to Huntington Beach. His driving skills were amazing, he managed to gently release the car into the driveway so as not to scratch it, but his personal skills were even more impressive. Very kind, polite and a pleasure to speak with. Thank you. Hope we don't break down again, but if we do I hope that Deshawn is the guy to help us.</text>

Mesfin helped me get my dads car unlocked. The car lock was extremely stubborn but once Mesfin showed up (5 mins from my initial call to AAA) he unlocked the car and was super friendly. Thank you Mesfin for saving our weekend!!! You’re the man!!!</review>

So I called around other services around Orange and nobody was available. Fortunately, Hadley answered my call, gave me a reasonable quote within a 5 mile radius. Since my car was modified and lowered, the driver was extra careful and made sure my vehicle was safe. I really appreciate your help guys!<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Amazing service! I had a flat tire when I came into work today and it wasn't the best thing to start off my week. Triple A sent out Hadley Tow to have a look at my tire. The last thing I wanted was to change it to the spare I had and waste my day at a repair shop that would have probably charged me an arm and a leg to fix it. Thankfully that didn't happen and Hadley Tow sent out Basel who took the time to look at what was wrong with my tire and permanently fix it. I am so thankful and happy for Basel and the people over at Hadley Tow. Thank you once again!< /text>

<Review>I don't believe I've ever had an experience with a towing that was worth writing up a review for, and even then it woud likely be a bad one, to say the least. However, after AAA paired me up with a Mr Geovanni Valle from this tow conpany late wednesday night (when the air in my rear tire decided it liked being outside the tire better than inside, and escaped lol) I couldn't have had a better experience and a more friendly and considerate person come to my rescue than Geovanni, who even took extra efforts to make sure the black rims on my BMW wouldn't be damaged if possible during the transporting to my tire shop and loading/unloading my car. Add that to the fact it was already past midnight by then and you sure earned a review out of me! Would give 10 stars if I could! Thank you again for the help, you were a lifesaver!< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>THIS Place allowed someone to pretend they owned my car and then Hadley didn’t do t their proper background checks or DMV reports and ended up hooking and towing my car that’s in my name that I have the title to and they took it from a parking lot at a hotel I was at and dropped it off somewhere and then has the audacity to try to trick me and lie and say AAA called in the order and AAA
has no recollection of this transaction and now I’m in the process of serving Hadley for stealing my car which They still have no idea where it is</Text>< resp>

First Driver dispatched by AAA never showed. 2nd Driver dispatched by AAA had an attitude and said he didn't have the proper equipment which is a lie as I was a service manager for an Auto shop and a Service Writer for Chevrolet in Long Beach. 2 1/2 hous later ULTIMATE TOWING DID THE JOB.

The worst company that I worked with.they give you a quote over the phone and they charge a different price when the job was done.i gave them the details of what needed to get done we agreed on one price and I ended up paying double the amount. Please don't use this people they're crooked.</Text>

Truck 315 almost rammed me into a building when I was going slow over speed bumps when he came up to me doing 30 in the lot cut around me in his flat bed and almost pushed me into the wall of a building. Followed him after and he said he had a “urgent call” when he was just picking up a vehicle at collision repair on Logan street at 9:30 am 10/19/19. The driver was reckless driving and had zero regard for the safety of others and himself. When confronted the man was hostile. Reached out to Hadley and had no action taken. This is a company disregard for the safety of others.<//text>

AVOID business here at all costs. threatened to add fees because they disliked the fact i had grievance with them. They did not specify on their signs they go by 'calendar day' after the first 24 hours. Expect to pay more than you probably should. HADLEY TOW is full of hot trash disorganized employees and the different locations are in the nastiest, most dangerous part of whichever towns they're in. Sketch city with these guys. It took them 30 minutes to retrieve my vehicle after i had paid cash-what were they doing back there? please be careful and don't be taken advantage of.< /review>

<review>Hands down the worst service and most disorganized company I've had the mispleasure of being forced to deal with. Zero ability to deliver or accommodate, understanding if clients needs not even an option. DO NOT call them for a tow, and if AAA books them for you, plead for a better option...< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Had a vehicle stolen, recovered by PD and Hadley Tow picked it up and towed it to their yard. Hadley would not release the vehicle to me unless I paid for the tow itself and the storage fees amounting to $300. If I couldn't pick up the vehicle within 10 days the price would go up toward $800-$900. Vehicle was stolen 9 months before it was found and I lost the registration in a move since then. Would not release the vehicle without the documentation even though my name was on the police report. Absolutely criminal how they get away with this kind of extortion</Review>

<text>These people gets in your vehicle without permission. I was getting my property out from my impounded vehicle and I saw this bald headed guy worker opening a SAPD impound car’s trunk and checking their stuff. I remember I left $5 in the front driver little cabinet for gas that same day it got impounded and when I went to go pick up my stuff after a month impounded at Hadleys, I realized that my $5 were missing. These ass poor people don’t respect your impounded property.<//text>< Pictures>

< review>
Only one person at exit gate. Lane is packed for 45 minutes.  Gate itself doesn't work. Security checks out 2 cars, walking slowly to the car, which is blocking exit, letting those 2 cars out, and blocks a traffic for another 2. What a mess! Manager here is most likely a d***- should be replaced immediately.  This is very unprofessional facility!!! Takes more than an hour to get a car out.< /review>

<rate>5</rate><text>Manheim Riverside is a pretty good Manheim facility. The only downside to this auction facility is the fellow dealers. They aren't the best class of people. I'm not a huge fan of them. The staff are great though. I appreciate them. They're great people. They are the reason I keep coming back to Manheim Riverside. I will be back again. Mask on of course. Thank you Manheim.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMETAPfM2HhQijMRnapMpKqiKnAH_Ar_tVygxKq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Response>

Manheim has all the greatest and lastest vehicles for sale. Although due to co-vid 19 all sales are currently virtual/on-line sales.</Text>

Over 3 weeks to try to arb a car for $3k in repairs that were missed by their condition report writers.  Then they don't arb anything when they are missed.  The auction says "non-permanent damages".  Everything is fixable on a car for a price.  That means they should never arb anything.  This is the worst place to buy inventory!  There are much better sources these days to purchase inventory that are much better to do business and less in fees.</review>

I can't believe Manheim would allow their reputation to sink to these standards. The bathroom has mold, urine pools on the floor, peep holes in the wall, soap hasn't worked in 3 years... simply disgusting! And smells horrible everyday.

Sad that for years no one had the decency to report to this to upper management.<//Text><Rating>1< /Rating><user>101760638508168917493</user><GmapID>0x80dcb138cba3c943:0x468583aed34b56ae< /GmapID><Date>1525309741851</Date>< response>

Bought a car sent cashiers check sent transport to pick it up car wasn't at manheim. Nobody can tell me where the car and they wont reimburse me. Spoke to everyone at the auction except for managers. They refuse to answer my email or reply to my messages or answer my calls. At this point it's been 72 hours and nothing yet.<//text>

This place is complete nightmare. This is high traffic manheim location that sells a lot of cars, and that means there are a lot of transporters here to pick cars. They have only 1 gate to let drivers out and this creates huge line of drivers trying to get out. Just getting one car out on average is 30-45min ordeal. when most drivers here picking up 7-9cars, it takes better half of they just to get the cars out.< /Review>

Its was bad experience ever.  The system was slow so takes a lot of time to do payment,  you after that you have to walk about half mile up and down to get the car keys ,  always keys missing, try get help of someone and then no one knows what's going on,  go to see the manager for this  location she was mean lady her name "claudia "
She don't knows what going on, the security don't knows about anything,  wasted my time,  very bad experienc.< /review>

This place has the rudest and incompetent customer service I have ever seen. What is wrong with these people? If you do not like your job, leave. REALLY NASTY CUSTOMER SERVICE.  It took them 6 months to release a title.  They sold my car 3 weeks ago yet have not released payment.< /Review>

I have to tip my hat to Manheim Riverside. I haven't been easy on my reviews, but lately I am seeing improvement all over the place. Maybe it's because I have a better understanding of what the Manheim lit workers actually go through. Maybe some of them recognize me and know I try to help instead of hinder. Whatever the reason, things at Manheim Riverside (at least on the lot) are looking up. I'm happy I can continue loving my job.</Text>

The next day, I called twice and still didn't hear from anyone. Then finally the 3rd time, I was able to get ahold of someone.  I was "helped" by Gabby Garcia and she was very rude to me. Her tone was spoken in a aggressive manner. She said "People have been calling all day, I cant control how many calls we get" I was very upset with the way I was being treated. She has horrible customer service and could use some training for improvements. Bottom line, she did not help or answer any questions I had. She just read the "script" to me and ended the conversation. I would give this place 0 stars if I could.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<time>1542229001706< /time><rating>1< /rating><Review>So, in only approx the last 3 months, I have experienced the following LARGE problems/lack of attention to detail:

A. I paid for a vehicle in cash, 16k. Received a paid in full receipt, and gate pass to remove the vehicle. Title was mailed to me a short time later, maybe about a week. Of course the gate pass would not have been issued, and the title would not have been mailed HAD THE VEHICLE NOT BEEN PAID IN FULL. There's no way around that with Manheim. So approx 2.5-3 weeks after paying for the car, I received a call from that location, get this: asking when I was going to pay for that car!!!! Flabbergasted, I said I already had, had picked it up, and received title already - two things which would have NEVER happened if the car hadn't been paid for!! I was told they'd do some research and get back to me shortly. Irritating but I wasn't worried. A few hours later they're calling back. I am told "Sorry, we have NO record of your payment, and DO NOT BELIEVE this car has been paid for. Pay the original balance plus late fees immediately, or bring the car back to us! It's clearly an error that a gate pass was issued and title was mailed." WOW ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? So pay twice for the same car, or give it back and let them keep 16k? Get the F out of here!!! I found my "paid cash" receipt for that VIN, marched it into a location, and got that cleared right up - though I never received an apology or even an excuse as to what may have happened on their end with regard to the error/oversight. What a great (lousy!!!!) computer system they have.....

B. One car I purchased, while I made sure to review the vehicle summary page - where it shows sale date, VIN, miles, the seller, CR score, link to Autocheck and Carfax reports, etc, then the "SALVAGE-YES OR NO" line, being clearly notated as *NO*, then after purchase receiving a Salvage Title instead of a Clear Title!!! Titles are non-negotiable in all 50 states, meaning if it's sold as Clear it has to actually and truly be clear. So after THAT phone call & subsequent research, found out the vehicle had a 'notation' as salvage/prior theft recovery in the Separate-window-opening "Seller Comments" button/section at the very bottom of vehicle summary page (which nobody clicks on).... Yet I was flatly told I should have clicked on & read those comments too -- doesn't matter one bit that the MAIN summary page showed "SALVAGE-NO", so it's *MY* problem now. BTW: the car brought clean title money. That's a nice little trick to offload a salvage vehicle for clean title money, right?!

C. Bid on a vehicle online, on Simulcast. My bid was accepted, I was the high bidder, and couldn't bid anymore (against myself!). At least 5 full seconds passed. Right before the auction ended, the bid actually ROLLED BACK, to the company I was bidding against, and THEY "won" the auction -- for a lesser amount than my accepted/recorded bid!! No explanation could be offered when I raised hell to managers, GMs, and corporate. Needless to say I didn't get the car. Wow!

D. Attempted to sell a vehicle. Got the lane and run number. Watching the auction as I was out of town, my car miraculously DOESN'T EVEN RUN!! Wow!

I'm furious. And I'm not going to run it 40 cars afterward, as most buyers waiting for it would have already moved on, thinking it wasn't running. Missed that opportunity! Dealers bring cars to Manheim to RUN AND SELL -- correct??? How does that occur if those cars don't EVEN RUN?? Completely ridiculous!! The explanation? We had a big problem with that this week. Lots of cars were in different lanes for some reason, and never ran. Your car that should have been in Lane 2? Yeah it was in Lane 8 - not sure why and sorry! Let's try again next week... Lol.

Wholesalers beware! Manheim keeps changing their arbitration rules almost in a way you can not even arbitrate. I constantly get PSI on the vehicles I buy and turns out some have issues and its like pulling hair with Manheim to get arbitration done. I closed my account with them, I suggest others to do so as well. They do not care for their wholesalers who buy 3-4 vehicles a week, because they are so big.. they do not pay attention to the their customers, especially wholesalers.<//review>

Worst Experience. Getting any information from them is completely impossible! Cheryl in titles never calls you back or keeps you updated with anything. It has gotten to the point where they ignore my number until I call from a different phone line they don't know. How unprofessional!<//text>

In addition to those, I've had numerous other smaller problems - such as but not limited to: floor prices not being put in at all/or put in at the correct amount, condition report or lack of condition report requests being put in incorrectly (ie in reverse of what I want), additional fees being charged WHICH ARE INCORRECT and not accurate (so keep an eye on your invoices or you'll probably pay a bit extra), evening gate hours being changed randomly so when you show up to pick up a car you have to come back the next day instead, occasionally cars on their property being messed with, andddd the list goes on....!!!!

Do I really need to come in and HOLD ALL THE EMPLOYEES HANDS, making sure they do their job properly??? What a disgrace!!! It's mind blowing how much stuff they've got wrong for me (more than has been right, I can assure you of that!) and that's JUST ME - what about the other thousands of dealers nationwide??

But, when Manheim makes A KILLING charging Buy + Sale Fees on every car, Condition Report fees, Sale Day Wash Fees, an additional Internet Satisfaction Fee (for internet sales - BOTH to buyer & seller!!), PSI Fees, Cash Payment Fee, etc, and contracts out the auctioneers to minimize employees & overhead - plus plays favorites with large new car stores and high volume dealers, they simply don't care about customer service or ANYONE -- just the bottom line profit margin. Which is sad really!!! Shame on you Manheim!!

And now, Manheim wants to focus more on digital sales - so buyers can't even see & inspect the cars they're supposed to be spending money on??? HAHAHA WHAT A JOKE!!! NOPE, NEVER DOING THAT!!!

While I will say: to deal with them is basically a necessary evil as they're the largest auction nationwide, and most dealers don't have much of a choice - it would sureeeee be nice if they upped their customer service & attention to detail immensely!! I guess that's my dream for the future, similar to Martin Luther King Jr's dream I guess.... maybe one day....

Until then: I wonder what the next fee they will come up with will be?? Perhaps like the commercial, a "fee fee". Or possibly a fee to enter the premise on sale day/an entrance fee. Or maybe start charging to park in their lot to attend the sale? Only time will tell which way this goes....

Thanks for reading and be careful dealers!

Note: these experiences above have been at several Manheim locations across three states, not just one location in particular.</review>

Horrible!! A vehicle we have sent to this auction got lane and run number but never crossed the block. Not once but twice! Also we purchased a Prius from this auction as well with 100,000 miles on it. After bringing the vehicle to a Toyota service center we found out the real millage was 400k. It was a green light sale. BUYER BEWARE!!!< /text>

It is very hard to get them to help with problem titles or getting title status on a title you haven't received. When I call, I am talk down to and still don't get what requested the first time calling and faxing.  I just don't understand why they are so rude and it is not just me.  I have heard from other dealers and auction how they do not like dealing with Riverside.  This is something they need to work on.  It is hard enough to deal with DMV and the public.  Last error I had them had put wrong buyer on title.  2 weeks later nothing, called dealership directly.   Makes you think...< /text>

Receptionist has anger problems, payment area ignore you and when you want to ask a question they give you attitude. Pauline was the only person who was very informative and helpful. Extra fees were charged and we were never explain, gave them a call and Sharil answer she was helpful, however when she transfer me to the people who could have explained the extras fees, to which I left a message and it's been two weeks after several attempts, I yet to hear from them. When I went for a automobile inspection no one could help, waited about 45 min after asking the security who also said he did not know anything. After inspecting the vehicles  we notice that  they were in horrible shape; which was not disclosed. When asking why , we were told that they could not explain how that vehicle got in the line and that it must had been a inside employee who probably did not do it's do diligence. This is a horrible place and we purchase three vehicles.. I have never experienced such an unprofessional environment for such a nationwide company. I also purchase a out of state vehicle in Philadelphia  and I put it back on the line it sold for more and kept living them message to give me back the profit, this was one of the extended auction partners of Manheim( Bell air auto auction ) . I called them for a month no one returned my call nor could not give information even though I had my receipt number. I still to wait for a return call.<//review>

<Review>I am not sure how this auction treats the locals, but if youre an out of state buyer save your self the headache and dont buy from this auction online! The condition reports are rigged, i purchased a vehicle and when i received it the speedometer was missing!!! The trucker noted this issue as well upon pick up. I opened a claim with arbitration claiming that this vehicle is TMU(true miles unknown) and that it should of been announced, in response i received: since the vehicles speedometer was stolen on premises we were able to record the current miles when the vehicle arrived originally, since the vehicle never left our lot assume that the miles are still the same... Really?! Then why did the condition report have images of the car prior to the theft, shouldnt the condition report been redone to represent the current condition? Either way hard lesson learned!! Stay away from this con location unless you like surprises.<//Review>< Pictures>

If auto sales fraud involved you should really not protect the buyer. You are enabling fraud. Or maybe its because you are involved with selling cars fraudulently .
The car I purchased has 2 sellers, you and MM Auto. So between the 2 of you the odometer was rolled back. FRAUD</Review>

<review>Horrible Arbitration department, you might at well keep you PSI money and blow it at a casino, because you get the same odds when dealing with Kelley Creasey in the Arbitration department, and just like casinos "the house always wins"

Bad Faith business dealings, they don't know what they are talking about, nor do they care about customer service.... Try Adessa<//review><Name>Larry Violette</Name>< Rating>

< review>
Worse Auction I've bought from on the web via simulcast.  The CR reports was incorrect.  When I bought the car, it said 3.0 and average.  I went to pick the car up, the check engine light was on, the car idled rough and the car was a total mess.  I decided to re-run the car the next and had a CR report done and it came out as a 1.8 and ROUGH.  I was very pissed.  I then called to arbitration and the customer service was horrible, and the lady had the never to say the car didn't really cost that much.  Anyway, lesson learned and my advice to dealer is to never trust the CR report online and NEVER  buy a car from this location with out seeing.< /review>

Stood in line for a while but it was because a lady was working by herself and dealt with two other customers that came back and forth with her. She did an awesome job being in control and working everything out. Once it was my turn to order I got a spam bowl with thai tea and coffee milk tea. It was good! no complaints whats so ever. Gave a big tip for her, even though shes running back and forth and didn’t realized it. goes to show we all working hard, and some are working harder than others. Hopefully she gets a day off soon. - The guy with tribal flower tattoos</Text>< Pics>

It's really good. Popcorn chicken and mochi waffle are really delicious.
I like nutella mochi waffle and panda (honey sweet)babo milk tea very much.</Text>

< Review>
5 star for the employees and their great customer service. 1 star for their business and their food. de milk tea and a drink that they offer here is very diluted and it tastes like water. If you order a normal standard drink it taste super sweet.If you ask for the drink to be less sugar the drink is super diluted. To simplify my personal experience the quality is not there for the drinks and a food.< /Review>

This place makes me want to squint with the pure force of a thousand leaping gnomes. The atmosphere there lingers with the spirit of Woodstock combined with a carnival fair, Acid included. Great place for merry making and being at peace with yourself through the divine power of the holy spirit himself Neptune.<//Text>

I love the seating area but wish that they would expand it because there's not enough room as people just want to lounge which can be an inconvenience for real lunch goers who work in the Mall. Overall, nice little place to have lunch.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808e32a1b43c1bf3:0x8d2d41a5b29f3aa6<//GmapID></record>

< review>
The food was really good (I had the popcorn chicken rice bowl), it was served to me around 1 literal minute after I payed, and the portion size was good for the money (I paid $6).

I didn't like the tea though (I had the kiwi green tea with boba); the boba was good, and the kiwi flavor was nice, but the green tea tasted like it was cooked a bit too long (overly bitter).

Overall, I will definitely go again, but I'll try a different drink next time.< /review>

You know it's not a fancy milk tea place, and the milk tea are budget level. But I love the snacks here.</Review>

On Saturday, March 23, 2019 we received our annual spring A/C checkup. Our service advisor was Eric Rodriguez. He was very professional and thorough in his performance. He took the time to explain what was completed and the readings from the A/C unit. It was more than I expected. I hope Eric continues with the company because he is good at what he does. I hope he knows that A.I. (artificial intelligence) will never replace the services he performs.< /Text>

The service was super fast, very efficient. You could not ask for a better encounter. There was one thing, Price when you are on SSI it makes it hard.  Other than that A+ all the way. we have been with them for almost 30 years.

Called for a quick estimate to get work done on my ac unit and was told it would cost me $65.  Zero compromises on the estimate and no hourly rates were given.  It's pretty obvious that they are trying to lock you in on service through them since you've already paid for an estimate.</Review>

{'time': 1557873613019, 'text': "We apologize but we don't compromise on our pricing. It's called an upfront, flat-rate price. The diagnostic fee of $65 is not to 'lock you in with us' but rather to help us partially cover some of our costs of labor, our truck costs to drive out to your home, our training to diagnose the problem, etc. You are never locked in with us. We are more than willing to diagnose the problem, tell you the cost of the repair up-front, and if you don't like the pricing of the repair, you're welcome to take our knowledge of what repair is needed and do business with someone else or repair it yourself! We don't do our pricing with an hourly rate, but rather as a flate-rate price for the repair, which is an advantage to you! You know the price ahead of time, no matter how long it takes us! You don't have to hold your breath, wondering if we are dragging the job out simply to charge more, and not every knowing the cost until AFTER we are done and you're STUCK with paying it. If we run into a snag, have to drive to the supply house, takes us longer than assumed, etc it's the same price to you! We hope this helps to explain. We hope you're able to get the repair done and have a comfortable and cool home again!\n\n~Andrea"}<//Response>

<Text>I am very impressed with the company.  They called me right before the technician was on their way.  They were on time and courteous.   Daniel Fernandez was the technician who helped.  He was honest with the assessment and to the point.  He gave great recommendations and other services the company provides. He would answer any question I had, without having to think about it.  He knew his stuff.   I will contact this company again.  5 stars!!!!!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

< Review>
Day 2; the circuit board that had to be ordered yesterday came in today and Travis was off but Jim came to install the board. Jim was wonderful! After I wrote a check for the first amount today, he came back and knocked politely on the door to tell me he checked on our warranty and because we were still covered, the parts were less than originally quoted!!!Praise the Lord!!! We paid almost half of the first check written and had a credited for the parts on yesterday's invoice. What a wonderful company to work with. Considerate, listens to their customer and allows there employee to take the time to check on a customers warranty to be able to give them the best possible price.  If you are using ABC for your heating, air conditioning needs you aren't getting the best!!!</Review>

We have used ABC cooling and Heating for several years.  They worked with us to replace the HVAC system a few years ago and have been servicing twice a year ever since.  They are quick, professional, clean, nice to the dog, arrive on time (with 2-hour windows, not 4-6), answer questions, make suggestions but are not pushy.  We recommend them.</review>

AC went out on a Friday night at 10 pm. Just my luck. Called these guys and described what was going on. They were there on time the next morning and had the parts specific to the unit- we are members of the maintenance program, so they already knew the type/ model of the unit and the program includes free initial service call and diagnostic. In two hours, we went from oh no, it’s starting to get hot to dang it’s cold in here! I appreciate the quick response and service! Thank you Vanessa, Mike and Diego! You are lifesavers!</Review>

Been using ABC for over 10 years in fact they installed my new HVAC system several years ago. They did a great job on the installation and have consistently done a great job with my semi annual maintenance service. JC was here last week and did a thorough job servicing my furnace.  He clearly communicated the latest on the system and was done before I knew it.  Great team, great company.< /text>

My thermostat wouldn't connect to my wi-fi.  I tried everything to make it connect without success.  So after I called ABC Cooling, they sent Mike Sarinana out that afternoon to help me.  Mike like everyone else that I have come in conntact with ABC was professional and courteous.  The best part was that he fixed the wi-fi problem.  I am so glad that I have chosen a company that still understands the importance customer service.<//Review>

< Review>
ABC Cooling has been at our house this week installing new equipment and making our house all around more efficient. Randy came and did an Energy Audit about a month ago and showed us all the areas of our house that were letting our very high priced heat and air out! We were debating on whether to get this work done or get Solar. So glad we went with this first. Solar will make way more sense down the road when we know how much energy we actually use rather than waste due to efficient ducting, insulation and old equipment.
The crew is not even done with the new insulation and we already can tell a difference in our living room! Our fire place actually is heating the front half of our house, rather than just the living room. Thanks ABC for helping us make this decision and for hiring such professional and kind employees!<//Review>

I learned that it is not a good idea to put instant mash potatoes down the garbage disposal. Our representative did a efficient job of fixing this problem. In additon he gave me an education on how to properly use a garbage disposal. Great job.<//review>

Tech (Mike Sarinana) called to let me know he was on the way, arrived in short time, was friendly and efficient, and explained what he did on my service maintenance on heater. Very pleased as always, been with Allbritten for about 15 years. 👏👍🏻< /Text>

< Review>
Great CS, time efficiency, and employee service; however, im only giving 4 stars bec the quote for a labor re: replacement of a coil under warranty was double the price of the labor of the last replacement we had but the service was not that great though with that other company. Still, maybe AllBritten can consider lowering labor for such needed repairs. Other than that, great service and company!</Review>

JC Garcia was here today to check ducts under the house.  He repaired a hole caused by rats problem and took lots of pictures.  Then he did general maintenance and added the yellow insulation where rats had removed some of it.  (The rats problem was dealt with about a month ago. This prompted the need for checking of the insulation under the house. ) He also helped program the settings on the thermostat.  He was very thorough, helpful, and pleasant to deal with.  He reported with pictures a serious sewer line issue under the house and I will be looking to take care of replacing a very rusted sewer pipe.  Thank you, JC!< /review>

We had our annual service done today by Eric R. from Allbritton the company we have used for the past several years.
He was professional, and thoroughly explained what he found during the inspection.  We definitely would recommend Allbritton for any HVAC needs.</Review>

<text>Allbritton once again provided us with outstanding service by sending out techs to review our HVAC issues.  when they could not provide a good plan they sent out their designer to review our system and provide the best fix for our problem at a better price than others provided.

Professional, friendly service.  As a bonus Allbritren called ahead of time asking if they could send their technician earlier than the scheduled time.  Come early?  ... Yes Please! This was was a major bonus for Allbtitten, most companies make you wait the day of service for  4 or 6 hours.  But when Allbritten called me nearly an hour before my appointment asking my permission for their AC specialist to come early.  I told them yes! I was so happy and pleased with Blake's service, that I purchased their Guardian Care plan for my HVAC UNIT from Blake.  Wow, what a great deal.  Summer service for my AC, and winter service for my furnace. They have treated me well.  Thank you. Allbritten.    Allbritten, I will recommend you to my fellow co workers.<//Text>

We had an issue with our water heater, Jonathen came out, fixed our water heater and brought everything up to code from the previous owner who did a horrible job.  He spotted pin holes  that would have been disastrous if they would have blown.  Went the extra mile and then some.  Will be only using them in the future.< /Review>

< Review>
I have not been to this gym since COVID started. I put my account on hold for 6 months (the maximum). I was not advised when that period ended, and was charged several months membership even though I never visited the gym. I let that go, and put my membership on hold for another 6 months, and then cancelled my membership. They charged me a final months membership because of the 30 day cancellation period, even though it was supposed to be on hold. This business practice isn't fair and is plainly wrong. If you want a gym that operates with no ethics, join this gym.</Review>

<review>This gym is a good place to train. The price is good and the staff is very nice. Having been in the fitness industry as a gym manager, competitive bodybuilder and personal trainer, for the last 30 years I would recommend this gym to anyone interested in a gym. The only draw back is that the amount of cell phone usage is annoying. Gym etiquette has been lost on this new generation. I would like to see a waiver that has to be signed especially regarding the use of cell phones while working out. Phone calls, texting and posting to social media have no place on the gym floor.</review>< Rating>

Great gym, super clean and organized, staff is great. Sign up was a breeze, none of that 'gym sales' BS. I had to cancel because I moved otherwise I'd still be a member. If you're looking for a gym around Camarillo this is the place.</review>

You can’t cancel your membership, no one answers the phone. I created an account online and Found a way to cancel that way. They wanted to charge me for the previous month they weren’t open, the month ahead and a yearly membership fee.  Why would I pay an annual fee for the year ahead if I’m Canceling? I was also charged for July when they weren’t even open. So much for no contract! No forgiveness for people concerned about their well being during covid. I don’t feel safe going to the gym during this pandemic. Very disappointing, misleading and deceptive business practices.< /Review>

I’ve belong to the 24 Hr Fitness gym since 1993.
I love their Zumba classes and everything there.
Glad they are open.< /review>

I love Fitness 19!!  The monthly price is great although l believe they could charge more.  I normally arrive during peak hours but am still able to use the machines l need for my particular workout.

The staff are wonderful and available to accommodate your requests.

Thank you very much for an always awesome experience!

Sincerely,

Deidre Whitfield</review>

I have been trying to cancel my membership at fitness 19, but there is no way to contact anyone by phone. I tried the customer service line for corporate which said the line had been disconnected, and I also tried to leave a voicemail at the location in Camarillo, but the line did not have a voicemail option. They charged me during quarantine and even in July after the gym had closed due to Newsom's order. I am really frustrated with the lack of communication options they make available to their customers during this confusing time.</text>

I’ve been going to Fitness 19 for about a month now. The gym is always clean, never gets crowded on the times I go and the staff is wonderful. I exceptionally LOVE the girls in the day care because my son always tells me how much fun he had every time he leaves.</text>

Good place, clean, staff is okay. For some reason they aren't open at 7am on some Sundays. Manager should have it open at their listed time. Kind of disappointing. If you can, shell out more money for 24hr fitness.< /Text>

Fitness 19 probably has everything you'll need for however you like to workout. It doesn't have as much as a place like 24 Hour Fitness but i don't have any problems working out every muscle group. The staff is nice and their bathrooms are clean.<//Review>

The place is great. Usually busy from 4pm to 7pm so I tend to avoid those hours. Some of the staff are very friendly while the others tend to let you do your thing which is good for me since I'm there to do my workout and not socialize. Free Wifi is big Plus and lots of TVs.<//text>

<text>Great gym, until you try to cancel your membership. I recently tried this, because we were moving out of state and there wasn't a gym within a reasonable distance. The closest Fitness 19 in Virginia..was a 50 minute drive, so we decided against it...we came into fitness 19 to cancel are were told that there was a gym in Virginia. Since we were already aware of this, we told them that it was just to far to drive...to which their response was..well its not that far, and we were asked several times if we "really" wanted to quit...since it was only $15 for each of us. We told them..several times that we did. Finally they accepted or resignation from their gym but did not mention they would still charge us an additional $15 for the upcoming month. When I called them about this, shortly after we cancelled they admitted that they did not tell us about the 30 day cancel policy and that the $15 would not be charged. Today..the $15 is currently pending...when I called I was told that the $15 would now be charged and that the best way to get into contact with the manager was by email. I asked when he would be in, or if he had another number I could reach him at and was told "no, email is really the best way". Both times I have called the women working at the front desk have been very rude and argumentative. I will not be returning to this or any other fitness 19 in the future.<//text>< response>

<rating>3< /rating><Review>Nice place to work out, but the trainer that sold us our memberships  (4) said it came with 12 personal training sessions.  We only got 2.  The bad part was when I showed up for the 3rd session and they said Sorry Dude, you only paid for 2..kind of embarrassing and we felt lied to.  Talked to the manager..he said no.  No compromise and no satisfactory resolution.
Added later:
Trainer said to us we would get 8 training sessions and four more if we signed up that day .  When we were denied 3rd training session from the trainer at the front desk, we asked to speak to the manager.  We talked to someone who claimed to be the manager but did not ask for his ID or anything.   If you want to just add the training sessions on our account, we will be happy to change this review.  We cannot post our phone number on a Google review, but will update it next time we visit the gym.<//Review>< Pictures>

I've been over charged at this facility numerous times, please be careful when signing up with this unprofessional company. The staff is rude, unprofessional and to be frank, incompetent. I would rather give my business to 24 hour fitness or ANY gym for that matter. Having a job at a gym has to be the EASIEST job in the world but for some, I guess its a "challenge". Do yourself a favor and just drive to 24 hour fitness, at least you know you won't be overcharged and lied to.<//Text>

I got set up with a membership today. I'm always a little "on guard" as I go sign up at a gym because in years past i've had very high pressure sales experiences at places like Golds and 24 Hour Fitness. I was expecting the worst while hoping for the best.
I must say I was pleasantly surprised by how clean and spacious this gym was. Also I found talking with Casey was super helpful and easy to get going. He made the sign up process quick and easy! Their pricing and over all offering was amazing. I'm looking forward to working out at both their Camarillo and Newbury Park locations as well as taking advantage of their spin classes. Thank you Fitness 19!< /text>

This was an absolute A+ experience from start to finish! When we called as new customers, all we were asked to do was provide the phone number of our pets previous vet office. They took over from there, called the office and got his records on file all prior to our first visit.

When we were arrived we were greeted by Kat. She provided excellent customer service, the perfect combination of friendly and professional. Next up was Dr. Bacon, who was everything you’d want your Veterinarian to be. Thorough, friendly, and explanatory. No stone was left unturned, we never felt rushed or silly for asking questions.

The perfect pet experience from start finish!!!< /Text>

<review>California Pet Hospital is awesome!  My girlfriend and I recently took our new kitten (Steve) in to be fixed and get the remainder of his shots.  The staff was so friendly.  Cindy handled Steve’s intake for us.  She was very informative and answered any questions we had, not to mention that she was a ball of energy and pleasant to talk to.  Steve is now home happier and healthier than ever.  Thank you!!< /review>< Pics>

We take our German Wirehair Pointer and Seal Point Siamese to California Pet Hospital for well-checks as well as for illnesses.   The veterinarians and vet techs are the best we've ever encountered.  All are very gentle and kind to our beloved pets, and provide exceptional and attentive care always.  Every staff member is friendly, professional, and responsive to our needs. Our pets deserve the best care and CPH delivers, every time!<//Text>

California Pet Hospital is amazing! My frenchie (Stella) has been going there from day one! She had two cherry eyes and they fixed them as good as new. You would never even guess she had them! The staff there is wonderful, inviting, and just the nicest people around! They are always the best with Stella when I have to bring her in for her shots, or check ups! Two thumbs up for this vet office!< /text>

Gave me a quote and when I brought my dog in for a procedure it was 500 more. Had to pay for items not communicated. This place was so much better when the last vet owned it. Was told to come back to more times and not communicated until we picked dog up. I had to respectfully ask the new Vet to please stop making excuses and I just wanted my pet and leave 2 times. Would not listen.</Review>

Really friendly and professional staff.  (Catarina? ) and Dr. Silver were understanding that we were limited on our budget.  We have spent thousands on our dog in the past and didn't want to repeat unnecessary tests or expenses. The meds and treatment healed up within a week.< /text>

<Review>We recently adopted a dog named Pancake from the Napa County Animal Shelter and decided to stay with California Pet Hospital since she had already been seen there. That is the best decision we ever made! I recently tried to trim Pancake's nails and ultimately needed help. I took her to California Pet Hospital 15 minutes before closing where Jess, Dana, and Christian all stayed late to bandage her paw. They truly went above and beyond to make sure our pooch was okay. I would recommend California Pet Hospital to anyone who is looking for a vet in the Napa Valley.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Saved my kittens life. Love Dr. Felicity Moffatt.  Kitty had a serious swelling in his belly - he was a shelter kitten that I fostered.  It was horrible and sad to see his condition.  Thanks to Dr. Moffatt + the amazing shelter teams support, Scooter pulled thru. He is a very healthy, happy well loved "foster fail".<//Review>< UserId.>

I came to California Pet Hospital for a second opinion and saw Dr. Silver. She is amazing! She removed a spindle cell tumor on our 9 year old boy and was extremely thorough, caring and kept me informed throughout the entire process. The staff are very welcoming too! Thanks for taking such good care of our sweet boy :)<//text>

Still a great clinic, with exceptional animal care.
My pet has been a long time patient at California Pet Hospital. Recently,  the business has been taken over by new owners aside from some new faces, my pet still receives the same great quality care as he has always received and have come expect. Everyone is friendly and professional and always welcoming and is still the same great place!</text>

<text>I do not even know where to begin in trying to explain how WONDERFUL CA Pet hospital is. If your looking for someone who clearly cares about your animal, is patient and kind, (everyone is soooo nice here!) and who is hands down GREAT at their job then you found them. I am forever grateful for Dr. Louis. I came rushing in a few months back with my beagle who had multiple seizures within a few days. After our visit was over we were waiting to firm up our bill in the waiting room and she started seizing again. Cindy ran over and all the staff stopped everything they were doing to rush Lilly back in hopes to stop the seizure as fast as possible. The waiting room was completely full and in that moment everyone acted like she was the only patient there. At that point, I knew she (and my family) were in the best hands. I was a disaster... a complete mess full of tears having never death with this before. I knew it was not good but was just hoping for clarity and the best outcome possible. Dr. Louis was patient and calm when explaining what he felt would be the most effective and fastest plan for Lilly to have the best chance of recovering and living as long as she could. Fast forward 4 months and here we are. We have our happy, energetic, fun-loving Lilly back who we just love like crazy everyday. (BTW, when I say Dr. Louis cares... I know he cares because I email him update pics of Lilly and he prints them to post in the waiting room.) They are care so much.. what more could you ask for when it comes to your hum-dog? Lilly is much calmer and loves seeing her people for checkups now. I truly feel she knows they saved her life. :0) I'm not sure how or why anyone would take their pet anywhere else. There is no way of thanking or showing the entire staff at CA P. Hosp how grateful I am for everything they have done for us.

I really liked this place when Dr. Lung ran it, but alas, he sold it and it has been uneven since. We have had issues with communication and fouled up appointments, and a round robin of Drs. The staff does seem to love the animals which counts for a lot. The lobby, office, exam rooms and exterior are very dumpy. Who knows what the lab and surgery are like? No cups for water dispenser, no trash can in the small boring waiting room.
My suggestion is to expand and remodel and modernize the entire place, pay more attention to the people in the lobby to make it a better experience.
I will give it a bit more time, but I am not impressed.< /text>

{'time': 1530056652970, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to send us your feedback. We are sorry to hear your experience with us at California Pet Hospital was less than satisfactory.\nWe just wanted to take this opportunity to explain the situation in more detail.\nNorton presented first thing on Monday 6/18 for sneezing and nasal discharge. A foreign body was suspected and he was admitted for a possible foxtail search. We offered the first line of treatment for this which is sedation and removal using an otoscope. Given the emergent nature of a foxtail, Norton was made our priority and the procedure was performed ahead of our other scheduled surgeries and appointments.\nAppropriate sedation was administered by our team. The nasal cavity is very sensitive and adequate sedation is extremely important to facilitate the safe removal of the foxtail without any movement from the pet. Any movement whilst scoping can cause bleeding and potential damage to the nasal cavity.\nOne foxtail was found and removed successfully. Norton went home that day with directions to return for a follow-up appointment.\nThe following day, Tuesday 6/19, he was still sneezing and we saw him for a courtesy recheck exam. He did appear bright and active and had no signs of nasal irritation/discharge. We presented the sedation sheet with the found foxtail in person to Ms. Slaten. We explained that the irritation may be inflammatory as foreign bodies can cause some local irritation despite removal.\nWe recommended you monitor Norton closely throughout the day and if there were any further issues, bloody discharge or the sneezing continued to return so we could further investigate.\nYou were advised that he may have a second foxtail up his nose, although rare, it is possible especially at this time of year when pesky foxtails are everywhere!\nAntibiotic therapy is not standard for foxtail removal from nostrils. Antibiotics can also sometimes suppress clinical symptoms of further foreign bodies, hence why they were not prescribed in this instance.\nAt this time you decided to seek services elsewhere and we were unable to complete treatment for Norton. We would be more than happy to discuss the case with you in more detail and also share the medical notes with you and your family should you wish. Please don’t hesitate to reach out.\nYours sincerely, California Pet Hospital'}</Response>

<gmap_id>0x808506e13a5e186d:0x7c182a3e13118906< /gmap_id><text>DO NOT COME HERE! This place used to be awesome when Dr. Lung and his staff were here. We brought our dog in for a foxtail removal and after spending the entire day there...they failed to remiove it even though they said they did from his left nostril. They heavily sedated my dog...he couldn’t even walk or keep his eyes open and had to be carried at 5:30pm despite having the supposed procedure in the morning. They didn’t show us the foxtail on a gauze they claimed they removed when we picked him up. He started sneezing again that night and next day which led us to believe that he still had the foxtail in his left nostril because it was still secreting a lot of mucus. We took him in the next day and asked for antibiotics which is standard after foxtail removal and they only gave us an anti-inflammatory and said that it is normal for dogs to keep sneezing after foxtail removal...wait a few more days and if he doesn’t stop bring him back in for a more expensive endoscopy procedure. After another day and night of heavy sneezing and mucus, we took him to another vet to get a second opinion and sure enough they found a foxtail in his left nostril which they showed us on a gauze! They didn’t even have to dig deep in there, it was close to the surface and were done within an hour. My dog came out alert and walking! My husband went back to California Pet Hospital to talk to the Clinical Director about our experience and how dissatisfied we were but she was so rude and talked over him the whole time. They only care about money and not about you or your pet. They could’ve killed my dog!

This second review is to correct the lies that were written from the owners response...When we took our dog back on Tuesday, 6/19. Dr. Louis Roussille noticed that he did have mucus discharge from his left nostril and drew a diagram of our dog’s nostril and showed us that he went up as far as he could go and was certain he removed the foxtail. He never mentioned the possibility of a second foxtail. Also, the “courtesy” recheck was not really a courtesy recheck that you wanted to grant us...you were going to charge us for the recheck but when my husband talked to your staff about why we shouldn’t be charged for a 5 min consultation...you agreed not to charge us. After talking to different Vets and checking various websites, antibiotics are recommended after foxtail removal because foxtails carry bacteria and there is a chance of infection.<//text>< Pictures>

< review>
This restaurant is a disgrace the food was served to me raw on mothers day and took over an hour to come to my table. The manager simply said the most he could do was give me a free desert. The service was terrible and the manager simply has no customer service skills and does not know how to run a successful restaurant.<//review>

<Review>Ordered curbside. The Lasagna Bolognese is $18.00 and that's all you get, a sliver of greasy/oily lasagna. No bread that Macaroni Grill usually gave at each meal, no soup or salad? (Well you could for another $2.50) I understand we all have adjusted because of covid living, but If this is a result of that at least make the adjustment to the pricing as well.  Definitely NOT worth the money.  This is a rip off. Don't think we'll be coming back here.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
Made a reservation, got there 15 minutes early and checked in. We were told they couldn't seat us early and they would come out and let us know when the table was ready.  The hostess forgot to mark us down that we arrived. After watching many other groups being seated, we complained and got seated. The food was edible but it wasn't good.
I was very disappointed on just about everything and won't go back.< /Review>

I waited 45 minutes before she brought over my drink. It took her 25 minutes just to tell me they did not have the type of wine I ordered. My husband started to order his drinks 2 at a time since the wait was so long. The food was cold and also took a long time. The waitress was nice, but hardly checked on us. The place was not crowded, but I am guessing they are under staffed. Also, it did not help that she was new.< /Review>

One hour wait and got no food. Waiters chatting with each other without even bringing bread to our table. Place was not full, even accounting for empty tables due to social distancing. Dirty plates. Left after staff said it'd take at least another 20 mins to get our food. Unprofessional staff that didn't address any of the issues.< /review>

<time>1613365653974< /time><Review>The order I placed for delivery was missing a salad and the macaroni and cheese bites appetizers.  I had to call 3 times and was placed on hold for over 10 minutes each time.  When I finally spoke to Katherine to explain the missing items from the order, she only offered a complimentary appetizer on the next visit.  The items I paid for, and missing, were more then 1 complimentary appetizer.  Only after insisting I get a refund for the items I did NOT receive, rather than a "complimentary appetizer" did Katherine agree.  Not to mention I tipped on the total order , including the items I never received.  Terrible customer service!<//Review>< Resp>

<text>I'm going to give this particular Romano's Mac Grill a 5 star bordering on 4 tbh. 5 only bc the wait staff was very nice and extremely hard working. This particular night was semi busy. The staff worked off of each other making sure the customers were well taken care of even if they were passing by another staff's table. Very friendly and warming from all of them. And considering it was outdoors, the staff did thier best to keep our cups full.

I found it unusual that they didn't have menus and we had to look at our phones to look at thier website to see the menu. I don't particularly care for this system.

The food was pretty good for a chain restaurant. I opted for the Trio Plate and the Bisque as a starter. The Bisque was a tad salty. I was offered another bowl but felt I already had to much sodium for the night. The Trio which consisted of Fettuccine Alfredo 8/10, Lasagna7/10, and a Chicken Marsala was decent 6/10 (it was kinda burnt). I was happy my plate came out nice and hot. My daughter had the Spaghetti and meatballs. It tasted decently good as well. 8/10.

I'd probably go back again. If I do I'll give it another review update<//text>< Pictures>

Food delicious, but overpriced.  I ordered a build my own pasta, with fettuccini noodles, alfredo sauce, garlic, broccolini, and tomatoes.  My bowl was only sealed on one side, and came with the wrong noodles! It was not full.  So I waited for 30 minutes (10 mins on hold) for a tiny bowl of pasta that was not even right.</Text>

<Text>Like most chain Italian restaurants it's ok,  nothing special.  A solid B-, but if you know what real Italian food is like then a B is a decent grade.

The service was great and quick! The waiter was very nice.  The only thing I would say is that the food had a taste of cleaning product or acid tone, which was not pleasant. I am not sure why, but others at my table agreed.  Still a great place but the food was alright.< /review>

I was doubled charged for the entire meal!!!  My wife and I dined there in the patio area on 8/21/2020 and all was fine until the next day when I noticed on my bank statement that I was doubled charged, one charge was with tip, the other fraudulent charge was without tip. After many phone calls to the restaurant and many conversations with the manager (Ruben), he assured me that they would take care of it.  Nearly two weeks later I spoke with Ruben again and he said they processed the refund but the reason I don't see the money returned is because my bank is withholding it for some unknown reason.  Long story short, I contacted my bank and filed a dispute.  Currently waiting up to 30 days for this to be resolved.  Anyone reading this, be careful and review your charges after dining at this restaurant!<//Review>

Mediocre food, bad service, you would think with 2 customers in the restaurant, it would not take 1 1/2 hrs to get barely warm food. Extremely disappointing in my post Covid outing.  I expect better from Macaroni Grill.  My food was much better tasting, cheaper and actually unlimited at your competitor's restaurant.<//review>

Food was great!! I really enjoyed myself here.. First time and I may be going back!! Now our waiter... She could do her basic job a bit better.. Left us waiting too long to order food.. Then dessert left us waiting again.. Our check same thing.. Left us waiting too many occasions and honestly service wasn't there.. Food was outstanding just the service wasn't great.</Review>

Chrissy, our waitress, was truly amazing. She was personable, kind and very helpful. The food on the other hand was not that great 🙄. They changed their yummy old recipes to something that's is obviously cost effective but unfortunately that compromised the taste. They also made the portions much smaller now . Not a good move as loyal clients who choose to come to Romano's over any other Italian restaurant will be able to tell.
The kitchen was out of a couple ingredients which affected their appetizers and dinner selections.
It was an ok experience because of our waitress. She was awesome. We probably will not go back again as the food is not as we were expecting and used to. 😒<//text>

<text>Waited in the bar but one was there to even take our drink order. So after a few more minutes we walked to the back to see if they could come out and help us/order. After a few more minutes and no one even looking our way we proceeded to leave. And are not going to be returning.

Our experience tonight was horrible. I used to love Macaroni Grill, but I will never go there again. We ordered calamari. When the waitress brought it, she apologized for it taking so long, but they had burned it. The cooks intended for it to be served, but our waitress made them redo it. It was still pretty bad. My Chicken Parm was charred on the bottom, but it was served. Our waitress spent 20 minutes chit chatting with customers a couple of booths away. During this conversation, we couldn't get any service. Tonight was the first time in 25 years that I tipped less than 20%. I keep thinking I should have tipped less than I did. The place was nearly empty and now I know why. Hopefully it will fail soon and be replaced by something good. It's a beautiful restaurant.<//review>

I tried to order my my food through a phone order but I bought some gift cards awhile back and now I cant use them because macaroni grill doesn't know how to manage there restaurant by taking a phone order

For you information you cant order your food online and use a gift card to pay I called and verified that with one of your associates

No wonder why restaurant are closing they cant even take a order macoroni grill thumbs  down I had to give 1 star but it would be a negative the girl who took the order thumbs down also boo you guys suck< /text>

<text>My wife and I ate at the Corona Calf. location
this afternoon. Our first time eating at a Macaroni Grill. We chose it because we had
Christmas gift cards to use. What a delight!
They had a Valentines Special going on. I had the Salmon and my wife had the steak. Long
story short, the food was fantastic, the place nice and clean and “Jordan”, our server was
best we ever had! She was very nice, attentive and genuinely friendly. If you’ve never been there, do yourself a favor and go! We will return for sure.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Used to love coming here for an Italian meal since it's close but this last time made that completely change... got there kinda late (around 8) and there was maybe 5 other tables were seated, there were 4 of us and instead of seating us at a booth when about 90% of them were open, we got a table and asked to be switched to the booth right behind myself. We got seated and the first thing I realized was they need new booth seats because I had a spring was up my a** the entire time. We ordered our drinks, I personally got a glass of wine and water and I wasnt carded when I still look like a 19 year old (I just turned 21 a few months ago) but I didnt really care and my brother brought it up lol. Then looked at the menu and was suprised how expensive it's gotten,  about $16(If I remember correctly) for a plain fettuccine alfredo which made me feel uneasy afterwards and no small salad or soup with your entree anymore? When my brother asked about and the waitress argued with him over it. Never got a refill or asked if I wanted one throughout the entire meal start to finish. The portions are much smaller now than in the past and lower quality in my opinion. The only good thing I can say is the tiramisu is still good. I'd rather drive the 30-45 minutes to Newport and eat on the water since it's only about 10-15% more expensive than here with drinks. Hopefully it can get better but I, nor my family will go back until its recommended by someone I trust.</review>

I was craving pasta last night and I first called Chili’s and got put on hold for over 5 mins, so I called this place, Romanos, instead and promptly got put on hold again. This time, instead of elevator music playing in the phone while I waited, I could hear the woman who answered the phone and her male coworker talking about how she should be in the adult film industry. I brushed it off as something I misinterpreted over the phone, but a few moments later they continued the conversation and it was unmistakable that that’s what they were talking about. Apparently they didn’t know I was able to hear every word they were saying. I hung up and just went somewhere else and ordered in person. I thought a classy, expensive restaurant like this would have service to reflect their high prices, but I guess not.</Text>

I feel like the food isn't as good as it used to be. Our service was great though. Everything we asked for she took care of right away. She took great care of us. If they change their menu I would come back.< /Text>

<Review>This is one of my favorite downtown riverside italian restaurants. The portions are large, menu large, food hot and plentiful.  Service was consistently friendly and helpful.  The spaghetti and meatballs with garlic bread was my fav! I'll be back (unless they change to a new ownership/business)</Review>< pics>

Thanks for ruining our valentine's day- We waited for almost an hour, although we had a reservation. They are clearly not set up to handle days like these. I went and checked with the front door waitress a couple of times to see if our turn came. She would say" no not yet, no not yet. We are still seating earlier reservations ".But, I started seeing walkins and people with reservations later than us getting seated and I went and asked her. She unapologetically said" yea, we missed to seat you as we are extremely busy and have so many people in the list". I was like, what?? I wasn't upset that she messed up and didn't seat us when our turn arrrived. But, her behaviour was unapologetic and rude. This is just unacceptable. We felt humiliated infront of tens of people. We didnt want to make a scene and so we went and got seated. Even the food wasn't great and totally not worth the wait. No thank you.  Never coming back</Review>

<text>First time we came here for Thanksgiving it was amazing so we came back today for Christmas not such a great time . My mom's pasta had hardly any sauce or seafood. My fish was just ok and on top of a bowl of gneoki no tamatos and drowning in olive oil . The gneoki was so hard and dry could not even get a fork through it .  By the time everyone was done eating my stomach started cramping . Horrible food . The server hardly came to our table . Didn't get refills or a Togo box. F she never returned with it .85 dollars it was a waste . We will never be trying this place again .<//text>< username>

<Review>My friends and I have an annual Christmas lunch. This year we chose Mac Grill as our restaurant. I ordered off the lunch menu. I had the chicken parm sandwich (1st time) and I liked it, definitely would order it again. My friends had their "favorites", shrimp portofino and penne rustica. We also ordered the sticky cake dessert. One friend stated it "didn't taste like she thought it would". Service was great and we would all eat there again.< /Review>< Response>

We always give this restaurant a chance. Our first bad experience here was when we asked for a take out box because we over ordered and there were a lot of left overs, but the waiter threw them out. They gave us a slice of cake for the trouble. 😖😖😖

Second bad experience was when we ordered steak and got a meat that's tough as leather...
We vowed to never come back. I don't know why we did the third time.🤔🤔🤔

We arrived for dinner, thinking maybe the place improved. We were given a table behind the reception. We waited for about 15 minutes. That is way too long not even a soul came to ask us for drinks... I was wondering why when there weren't a lot of people inside the restaurant on a Sunday night. My husband and I said that's enough, we're not coming back ever.< /Text>

<review>It was a disappointing experience. We came Sunday evening. It was not busy at all. We were a party of three. The person in the front led us to a table only two setup. She did not add one more. So I asked the server to give me a set.   After we finished the bread, I asked again. It was not particular busy. I would say the service is lack of attention. Ok the food: soup is lukewarm, salty. We ordered the signatures mac'n cheese. After 5 minutes, they said they ran out of mac and need to change to use rigatoni, fine. Three dishes came. The rigantoni was not hot enough even it was in a skillet. I ordered a side dish of fries. It did not come. I need to ask the server and it came finally after we almost finished the main dish. But at least it is hot!  Well I have been to at least two other Macaroni Grill  Either have no problem in service or food was not bad in my memory. This time, the food and service was quite disappointing. I wish I did not go. There is s Chilli right next to it. They do have better busy for "some" reasons</review></record>

Horrible service, and the food was even worse. My steak was as salty as the Pacific and as tough as a shoe. They also said they "didn't have the ingredients" to make a drink they had on the menu but when I looked at the bar, they were fully stocked with said ingredients.< /Text>

The people are friendly., supposed to be a upscale family restaurant, but they use tap water high in chlorine content for their fountain drink machine. I could also taste the chlorine in the pasta that got boiled in it. I suggest they invest in a kangen water machine to cook with and a reverse osmosis for the fountain machine. Most likely, I will not return.< /Text>

<text>Very DISAPPOINTED . They placed my family and I in a short kid table with generic folded chairs. The chairs were very UNCOMFORTABLE. Our backs hurtl. We mentioned this to the manner. He did not cared.
The wine was served in a small glass like a kid glass, instead of wine glass. What happened to wine glass?
The food has a queen taste. My dish was shrimp scampi with angle hair noodles. However there was hardly noodles any in my dish.
Pricey food not worth it at all.
NEVER  will go back again.😤☹< /text>< userid>

Really friendly, quick service, good parking, and a nice atmosphere. My 7 and 10 year boys and myself are vegetarian and this is one of our favorite restaurants. I love the Ratatouille over crispy bricks of polenta (under 600 calories and some serious comfort food). My carnivorous husband loves it here too!< /text>

<text>Went here on Christmas Day and was extremely disappointed. My build your own pasta had an overwhelming amount of penne, and not nearly as much shrimp, grilled mozzarella or vegetables. So, I complained to the manager. He even admitted it didn’t look like it should and he noticed before the entree was brought to the table. Still, he allowed it to be served. He said he would speak with the kitchen. He didn’t offer to remake it or compensate in any way. The server was nice, so she gets the one star. She did offer to send it back to the kitchen, but I’m not a fan of sending food back to the kitchen for fear what may be added to the entree.  I also didn’t feel like waiting any longer, it took long enough to receive the entree. I will not return any time soon.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<text>We came expecting the REALLY good experience we had several years ago. Unfortunately, that was not the case. Our server told us he was going to bring our balsamic vinegar and disappeared. I had to go search it out from another server. When he finally came with the vinegar, he also had two drinks for another table. Then we asked for more bread and again he disappeared. When a third server brought our food, we asked him for the bread. Our original server never returned except to bring our bill. The bread was not as we recalled either. We won't be back. This was the one in Corona.< /text>< pics>

The chips and salsa are excellent and freshly prepared. The service is good but it could be improved since some customers seem to get more attention than others as far as checking on refills, if the food is good, etc. I will definitely continue to go.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>loved the service. our server, May,  was on it all night. the food on the other hand was mediocre at best. got spaghetti and meatballs; the wife got the farm house pizza. spaghetti and meat balls seemed over spiced with tyme or something, making it really herb potent. the pizza was better. wont be getting it again though. not what we were looking for.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>The booth seats need replacing. The springs had fallen and our guest kept sliding backwards. It was humorous bc we are silly but on any other day, in a packed restaurant it would have been a big inconvenience. Also. In between the plates given to us for bread. Someone wrote a note and stick it in between the plates. Either It was a disgruntled dishwasher employee or the staff. Either way not cool! The food tasted good. That is the only reason this location got 2 stars.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Quite possibly the worst meal in a very long time. Hint. Salt isn't a main ingredient! The service was very poor. They messed up our meals with the table next to us. They never came back to ask how we were doing. The restroom was our of paper. We let them know. They gave us attitude. I asked for the manager. He was hiding in the back.< /Text>

Well we went for father's day and the waitress came to our table maybe three times throughout dinner and had a attitude the whole time. The food was very bland and not worth the money spent. My dad was looking forward to coming here and left feeling very disappointed.< /Review>

< Review>
The worst service I have ever experienced.
We came with  my family  to the one in Corona. I called them 30 mins prior to reserve a table, when we came in it wasn’t ready, but they got it fixed fast. After we set, we started with drinks: water and sodas, we got them 40 mins after. Then 15 mins after that they brought the bread. So imagine to be an hour in the EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT and they didn’t even placed our order yet!
When we walked in, the place was nearly dead, only 2-3 tables were occupied on Friday night. At first we thought it was weird, but now we know why! I am pretty sure nobody comes back after the first visit!!!
So, we finally ordered our food after being there for an hour. 40 mins after that, they brought like a garden salad, then they let us know, some of the dish we ordered was not available, then the other 20 mins a soup showed up, and they informed there is no salmon, but they can get any other fish, after waiting for mahi mahi 20 mins, they came and said there is no fish at all.
We also got steaks, they brought them COLD, potatoes on the side were FROZEN!!!! We were really disappointed, but asked them to at least warm it up, they bring the steaks back after 10-15 mins, nothing was fixed, they were the same cold as before!!!
So we spend there more than 2,5 hrs, we were really patient and tried to understand the situation but it all was horrible!!! And obviously manager wasn’t even there.
They should definitely improve so many things!
I am really disappointed!<//Review>

Food was good but our server was a little short and inattentive with us. She was noticeably nicer to the people in the tables around us.  Seemed to be racially motivated. It was not busy in there at all either. We are not difficult people, we are good tippers, but it was too much even for us. Im very disappointed because it was my birthday and she made it uncomfortable with her dry demeanor and her obvious bias. I dont want to say her name because I wouldn't want to jeopardize someone's job.  We will not be going back for a long time if at all.<//text>

The service was poor and food was served at several different intervals with a long time in between.  The food was not prepared properly.
I would not recommend this particular resteraunt to anyone.</review>

The service was great! Someone in our group ordered Mama's Trio and got an itty bitty portion of the chicken parmesan; our waiter noticed without anybody complaining about it, and he brought another chicken parmesan out to our table. That's great service!<//Review>

Food is okay. They don't seem to know how to make a pizza very well.  They need a bubble popper.  My pizza had bubbles which, when they rose, caused all of my toppings including the cheese to settle in the center of the pizza and to one side.  The result was that only one slice had all of the toppings on it and yet no-one caught this and corrected it before serving.  The waitress took 5.00 off of the bill.< /Text>

You can't make this up.

I wanted to take my family and friends to have a  nice dinner for Christmas but it really was a horrible experience.
First I was told 15 minutes at 1 hr and 5 minutes later finally we were seated
But guess what the waiting was far from over.  We ordered after  sitting a short while. We ordered fettuccine Alfredo. 1 plate with chicken and shrimp 2 plates with broccoli.
Well after a while they came back and said they were out of fettuccine noodle and suggested angel hair noodles we said ok that's fine. Next we waited and waited and the waitress came and took my wife's coffee cup to fill it up  at this thinking my food has got to coming soon we waited some more. During this time the waitress had come back to the table to tell us our food was coming in had to tell her that it has been 20 minutes since she took the coffee cup to refill it and we're told that the  coffee maker was broke but was now fixed. 10 minutes later my wife had coffee. The waitress ask me if I would like a refill of my drink I had to tell her that at this point I just want my dinner she said it's coming up. Now finally after now 2 hrs. And 20 minutes I got my plate and was told that they ran out of chicken and now I am sitting here with spaghetti noodles and shrimp.
We eat quickly because we are really hungry and then the bill comes and I ask to speak to the manager and I tell her that this is by far the worst experience that I have ever had. And what makes it worse is they act as if they don't  care. I do not recommend this restaurant to anybody.< /text><userid>107570208181427468180<//userid>< Pictures>

Everything was awful, the food tasted like they just popped in the microwave, even though I waited 2 and a half hours to get it... The service was horrible!!! If there was a 0 star option I would do that...</text>

< Review>
The service was good. No complaints there. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere was nice and not too loud. For this, I give three stars instead of one.

On the other hand, the food was not so good. The bread had a good flavor but it was overwhelmingly salty. I ordered the butternut tortellacci. Honestly, with a small fraction of the salt this would probably be pretty good. It has prosciutto in it, which is already salty, so it really wasn't necessary to load it up. It totally smothered the flavor of everything else and left me with that heavy, bloated, sodium overload feeling like I just ate at Macdonald's.

My husband ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo. It's hard to mess that up. The pasta was alright, but the chicken was both sparse and extremely poor in quality. He regretted eating it and didn't feel well afterward. So about $4 to add that gross chicken to a $13 plate of plain pasta. Not a huge plate.

So the environment was nice, and the staff, but the food was not worth it even at a cheaper price. We decided not to return before we were even out the door. Now I understand why the place was not too busy on a Saturday evening. Our loss.</Review>

We love this place and have ate her many many times. Super bummed tonight. Both our meals were barely warm. My pasta was a bit undercooked and stuck together. Then as I am still eating our servor brings my bill to the table saying I had asked for it, which I hadn't, with someone else's debit card inside the bill. Sad for this experience since we chose to eat here after not having a meal out in weeks. Should have stayed home!<//Text>

Brunch was good, quantity of bacon given was skimpy.   My complaint is that the women's restroom was filthy and out of seat protectors.  I was there at 11 am and it was obviously not cleaned from the night before.  I am very concerned that if the restroom is not cleaned what about their kitchen.< /Text>

Our waitress, Charlie was great, she checked on us frequently and was very nice.  The appetizer, fried Portobello mushrooms was amazing, highly recommend.  I ordered the blackened chicken parmesan and have to say it was very good.  My husband ordered pasta di mare and he also said it was good.  We will go back :)</Text>

<text>I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs. Problem is that they didn't have any meatballs so they gave me pasta with maybe spaghetti sauce (too watery to tell).

< review>
I drive UberEats regularly and pickup from this Macaroni Grill pretty often. It always has alot of customers inside, but my wait for the takeout has always been just a couple of minutes until last nite. Took about 20 minutes as they were slammed. There was another UberEats driver in addition to the other delivery service drivers there, HubGrub & ? and there were also 4 customers that called in their orders for carry out.  The staff moved things along as quickly as they could to get each of us taken care of and on our way throwing in an extra something here and there or reducing the prices slightly to make up for the wait. It wasn't necessary as anyone that has ever eaten here should be aware that a busy restaurant means some amount of wait time due to the quality of food. The woman handling the orders (Yvonne) kept her composure as did the Manager (Can't remember his name). He gave me 2 different plates, a Chicken Alfredo and Lasagne for my wait. As I  said. they do see me as I said, quite often and maybe this was the reason. Both were very tasty and it was a nice gesture on his part. Now having tasted their food, I understand why the place always has alot of customers every time I'm sent there to pick up an order and I'll be taking my wife out to dinner here having sampled a very small portion of their menu. Tasty & Much appreciated.<//review>

One of the few remaining Macaroni Grills. The inexpensive lunches are not good. You would be better off with the regular lunch items.</Review>

We arrived and we're seated promptly. After ten minutes, we asked if we could get drinks and if our server was assigned to our table yet. We were brought drinks by a second server who told us that our waiter was coming shortly. We were told our server's name was ****. Bread was brought after we requested it twice. It was brought by another server. I requested a  build your own pasta sheet, and **** walked away after saying, "Yeah." Approximately ten more minutes passed, and **** returned. He asked to take our order, and I reminded him I had asked for a build your own pasta sheet.  He said, "Oh, yeah. Hold on." He came back with the sheet and we ordered. We also asked for drink refills. Included in what we ordered were two tomato soups. After fifteen minutes, our entrees came. It was brought by different servers. I inquired about our soups. The female server said she would check. She came back a few minutes later with the rest of our main dishes. She asked if we needed anything else. I asked for our tomato soups. She said she would check with ****, our server. He came by our table to offer cheese. I asked for our tomato soups. He left and returned with one soup. I looked at it, and asked, "Is that tomato soup?" He said, "No. It looks like minestrone." He returned to the kitchen and brought back another bowl of soup. This time it was tomato. I reminded him again how we had ordered two soups, but to please take the second soup off the check. When I took the first spoonful of soup, it was cold. I ate my main dish, and we asked for refills again on our drinks. **** returned and we asked for to-go containers and the check. He said, "OK" and walked away. He returned with the containers and the check, set them on the table and walked away. I asked another server to speak to the manager. I NEVER complain to a manager at restaurants.  I know food service is a difficult job. **** came back over and picked up two of our empty plates, and said, "Yeah, the manager will be over in a second." He walked away without taking any of the other plates. The manager came over and I told him I never complain at restaurants, but the service was terrible. He was apologetic and took the check to take some items off. I was facing where the wait staff works to input items into the system and print up the checks, and watched our server **** throw a wadded up piece of napkin or paper over the manager's shoulder while he smirked and shook his head. The manager,  brought the check back. I told him his server was the rudest server I had ever experienced. The manager again apologized and said he would address it.

I understand the manager addressed the issue, but this was terrible. The worst I have ever experienced.

Please never ever go to Romano Macaroni grill.< /Text>

< review>
The Macaroni Grill on Grand Oaks, Corona Ca has the WORST customer service ever. Unfortunately for us, we gave them a second chance and went there tonight. Big mistake.

My family and I (2 adults, 2 kids) were seated in the bar area, not our choice. We arrived at 7PM and waited 25 minutes, not too bad. The restaurant was extremely busy for a Friday night, first week in November.

We waited several minutes for someone to take our drink/appetizer order. Appetizers came out quick, but no silverware to eat with. By the time we got silverware, the appetizers were cold.

Eventually the bartender (cause he was the only one handling the entire bar and tables within) came to take our order, and immediately realized we never got our drinks. He took our order and returned with our drinks.

Once the food was delivered, our table was never visited again except to drop off the bill. No drink refills, no parmesan cheese to top our entre's, nothing. My wife had to visit the hostess counter on two different occasions to inquire about drink refills and bread.

There appeared to be two managers on staff tonight. We tried to get their attention as they passed by our table, (walking together deep in a conversation) it was as if what they were talking about was much more important than a paying customer who's bill was north of $80 for 4 people.

Ideally we would like our money back, but it's our fault for not leaving during the drink/appetizer debacle.

The irony is, out of all the other restaurants we frequent in (or near) the Corona Crossings Shopping center, (Kings Fish House, Wood Ranch, Miguels, Chilis, BJ's Pizza...etc), they all seem to handle a busy crowd, but for some odd reason, Macaroni Grill fails every time.

We wont be back. (Unless they read this and comp our meal, we did save our receipt)< /review>

I had the Carmena Chicken with a house salad, ok so what they should have put in the description is" a bowl full of greasy sauceless rigatoni that a heavy dose of salt and parmesan could not fix. Hubby had the 3 course dinner with the mac and cheese bites, pork shank and chocolate cake which translates into 4 squares of flavorless noodles deep fried with some tasteless sauce which we could not figure out what the flavor was supposed to be, a pan of overcooked potatoes, some carrots for color and a hunk of bone with some meat on the outside oh and the marsala sauce that tasted like it came out of a healthy choice box, now lets not forget the dessert that said chocolate cake but looked more like a flat cupcake with some stuff on it that tasted like oil and sugar frosting. The ultimate bellini drink was not named properly as it was more like syrup under a slushi and the always hot out of the oven bread which the waitress forgot to bring until we asked for it was just salty coated bread with olive oil that was turning sour. Overall definitely not worth the 80 dollar total with tip and when the manager in the prince purple shirt asked how was everything and we said OK you would think he would inquire as to what could have made it better but no he just walked away. Good luck to those who go there after reading this, you will need it.<//Review>< Pictures>

It was OK, not too impressed with the quality of the plate. Thought the Alfredo sauce was from yesterday and just microwaved. The chicken parm was dry. Not a good visit. It will be sometime before we return.< /review>
