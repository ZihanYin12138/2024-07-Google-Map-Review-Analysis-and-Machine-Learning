My friends love mongolian noodles so they begged to come here. I didnt really know what they meant but realized when I saw the layout. Mongolian bbq! Between 3 of us, we shared two entree (the cheapest option), which also came with a free extra noodles. The register gave us two bowls to fill up with meat, veggies, and sauces.

We got almost everything. I really appreciated the variety of toppings. The bar was also really clean. We got to the end and were ready to give it, but the man made us go all the way around the island to give it to him. He cooked it and added the extra noodles to one dish.

There was a lot of seating in the mall. The food was good, the beef tasted like jerky. We added pineapple and lemon to one dish to make it a little sweeter and it was really good! This is a simple place and the food is not bad.< /text>

So disappointed.  Never coming back - without chosing your own ingredients, this place is an overpriced 2-star meal.<//text><Rating>2</Rating>< Date>

I love this place! I wish they had an option to pay an extra dollar to have shredded cabbage instead of noodles or rice, but it's still amazing!
I do get frustrated by the other customers, though.. they pile their food so high that nothing sticks on, so they drop food and waste it.
I'm a little surprised the format doesn't go Chipotle style, with asking what you want and portioning it for you..</Review>

<review>Customer service needs to improve!
All I wanted was beef and extra veggies, instead of noodles and rice..that’s it. What is so complicated about that? They couldn’t get that simple order correct and then they couldn’t get a hold of the manager when I asked for a refund! The young lady at the counter was trying to be helpful, but I just don’t understand why such a simple request couldn’t be accomplished.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Awful experience. One star is generous. Counter where food is picked prior to cooking was filthy. When my wife's soda cup stuck in some of the debris and fell over, they charged us for a refill! Cook's were careless and much of my meal ended up on the floor. Really like Korean BBQ but will never come here again.< /review>

<Review>Regular plate and large plate, you can put as much as stuffs  whatever you like as long as plate can hold. Large plate gives you extra noodles, if you are hungry. Just like buffet style, here they prepare your food right infront of you.  Be careful it will be very hot, don't burn yourself.
You can sit and enjoy your food.< /Review><Rating>4<//Rating><Response>None< /Response><Time>1527540000838</Time>< username>

NOVEMBER 20th

DEAR SUNGATE BBQ,

I was craving some good Chinese good and my friend told me that we should check out sungate bbq. I went over and the little girl with glasses was so helpful. She told me the price difference between all the plates. You need more people like her she was so energetic, helpful, and amazing you need more people like her running the business. I will advocate for this girl (;< /Review>

Came Sunday July 25th around 2:15pm
After wait in line for about 10 minutes withe my small Bichon frise service dog , the cashier was extremely slow. Then when I was going to pay , the “manager” told me that I could eat in the restaurant but without the dog. I told her that this was against the law in California and tried to show her my dog service ID card which she simply refused to read telling me that not even service dogs were allowed. She is one of the rudeness “managers” I have ever encounter in my life. I think before named her a “manager she she should be appropiately trained on California law and also in terms of politenes and customer service
After reading all the bad reviews not about the food but about their customer service ATTENTION TO OWNERS: fire that lady because you will be in trouble with the law and is damaging  your business.</review>

Good stuff. Tastes good and you can load your bowl as high as you can with all the meat and veggies you can. FRESH AND HOT. I like it. $12.51 with tax for a large bowl and fed myself and my girlfriend. We stacked it very high and pressed it down.< /review>

<Review>Food is good would of given it a better rating. But due to poor customer service from the girl in the register. She just had a nasty attitude. I hope her manager can talk some sense in to her if they don't want to keep losing customers. Because today they just lost 3 new customers.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

They need to close that place down before they kill someone. I found broken glass in my food and I brought it to the cashier Alicia attention and she took the glass out of the food through it in the trash and didn’t apologize or call the manager. She said the manger will call me and she didn’t wanna give me the staff name or manager name. They place is very unsanitary and poor customer service.. they fry up everyone food on the grill without cleaning it or checking for allergies.. calling the public Health inspector right now!</review>

Went here with my sister. Food smelled great. My sister ordered two medium entrees to go. Paid and then waited for her food. She noticed the unsanitary conditions of the bowls of noodles sitting uncovered and food trays laying on top of the noodles. She decided she did not want the food. Went back to ask for a refund and the crappy rude manager said she could not give a refund. My sister had not gotten the food. They hadn’t even started making it. The manager Teresa saucedo was so condescending in her tone of speaking that I was in shock. How in the world could she be in the customer service industry and speak so rude to a customer. She claimed they had a no refund policy that the cashier should have told her. The cashier said nothing about  the no refund policy and when I went to read it it stated “ sorry, no return or refund if you change your mind after you put food into bowl. If there are strange objects in the food we will cook new ones or refund”. First thing is why in the heck should they need a no refund policy? And two she never ever touched a bowl or put food into a bowl so this does not apply to her. Please stay away from this place. I rarely ever right a review. But the lady Teresa was such a jerk I felt  I needed to warn people from this place. She wouldn’t even share the phone number for the restaurant or the managers name.  And dear sungate train your people better and rethink the refund policy. Keep customers happy so they don’t have to right a review just to get the attention it was only about 16 bucks that needed to be refunded. But this review is here forever.</text>

Had an order of the Large Bowl (~$12): take-out container sized portion of wok-grilled noodles, veggies (carrots, onions, broccoli, mushroom, bean sprout, jalapeño, etc.), & protein (e.g. tofu) "cooked to taste", i.e. seasoned with a choice of garlic & assorted sauces.  Food was delicious, staff was live, and the ambiance was ancient.<//Text>

Best fast food at the mall. You can pile on the garlic and oyster sauce. Minus a star only because sometimes they're out of cilantro and that's a dealbreaker for me.<//Text>

The food is ok but the service is the worst the cashier has a bad attitude and is rude when you ask her a question she replies with a brief answer she is more intrested in her family come to work and visting her. First and last time coming here.</review>

I don't like the cooks today when my dad was trying to fix his food in the bowl so the food won't fall and then one of the cooks said that he can't do that so my dad would let the guy take his food the the cook keep on trying to get the food but my dad flicked his and then my dad gave up then my dad did the middle finger then the cook threw my dad food then my dad got his money back then my dad said he is a crybaby and my mom said she is watching him then both  oops were smiling then my mom said "no u shouldn't be smiling because that was wrong"

Like I don't understand why one of the cooks would throw my dads food now my dad cant eat it so he had to go to a different food place to get his food< /review>

Walked in there on a Saturday, never been there before, for my son's haircut  The vibe was off doesn't look like a barber shop. No one greeted us, or made you feel welcomed for a 1st timer . Sat down and my son was uncomfortable and didn't want to get his haircut there. So we got up and left. Wouldn't recommend this place, not kid friendly or welcoming to new customers.< /text>

We enjoy going out. Last night we  visited this excellent restaurant which friends told us about. We enjoyed a lovely evening there with great food and  an experienced team and a distinguished  chef. We put this venue in our list  and we will surely come back very soon. We warmly recommend.<//Text>

I've been going here a long time and it's one of my favorite little hidden gems.  I've loathed telling other than close friends about this place cause it's small and can get too crowded sometimes and I get turned away at times showing up without a reservation... but it's time to grow up and stop being so selfish.  Sushi is authentic and reasonably priced, cash only, no non-sense kind of place.  There's better top of the line sushi at other high end places but Okina's combination of price, freshness, preparation and cozy experience makes it a 5 star place in my book.  Hard to find due to little signage and hard to park, but worth the trouble.  Japanese owner chef is talented and sometimes talkative, sometimes not and it helps to stay on his good side : )</Review>

We've been coming for years. It's the best in The City IOurHO (based not on knowing all of the Sushi bars in the city, but on total satisfaction with the quality, price and traditionally authentic sushi). Only open Thur-Sat. Tiny. Call before 5:30 to make a reservation for one of the two tables that seat 4 each, the one table that seats 2, or the bar that seats 6</Text>

<text>Make sure you call and make a reservation before you go!
You order nigiri here, not some baked salmon rolls, it's a traditional authentic sushi restaurant; food, decor, serving style and all. Enjoy it as if you were in Japan.< /text>< time>

Fresh, straightforward sushi.
Reservation only but pretty easy to get in - quick service and amazing dishes.

Chef's special is a favorite - haven't been disappointed!</Review>

Sushi done right. Family owned. It's not exactly like those sushi places near Tokyo fish market, but they're close.</Text>

Okina is one of my favorite new sushi finds.  Fresh sushi, great service and made by a  chef who truly loves his craft.  The place is small and it's only opens 3 nights -- Thursday to Saturday but  you can call to make reservations.  Go for the omakase and let the chef decide for you.  I heard he gets up at 4am to buy fresh fish.  Cash only.

The Arguello Market is right next door.<//Text>

<text>A good friend of mine born in Japan recommended this place as the best sushi restaurant in SF and I was not disappointed. Everything was traditional and sleek and honed to perfection. We ordered some a la carte items and a wide assortment of omakase and the whole table was cooing with delight. This place is a gem. Wonderful service, great environment, and absolutely top notch sushi.<//text>< response>

Excellent, authentic, affordable, fresh, and simple sushi and sashimi. This is a Richmond locals' favorite. Not for large groups--keep it between 2-4 people.< /Review>

Best way to experience the Embarcadero.  We had a blast with the sit on e-scooter with fat tires.  One caveat is website says they rent them for the day, but we maxed out the battery after 2 - 2.5 hours.</text>

<review>Pedego provided excellent service and beautiful electric/pedal assist bikes. Their directions for us (first time electric bike riders) was clear and precise. They told us the best way to get to our desired destinations, and made great suggestions for other places we might like to ride (which we took). We had a blast!< /review>< pictures>

<text>Sean was awesome.  Full of information at a pace I could keep up with. He had all the answers to all my questions.  Showed me all the features of the bike. Bought a second bike that day from a different dealer( they didn't have a seafoam color interceptor) . The buying experience was not even close to what Sean was able to provide ! Thanks Sean , keep on giving that great customer service.!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

From the first phone conversation days before when I made a reservation to the day of renting the bike, everything was amazing.  I wish I got his name over the phone, but he asked me questions to determine what kind of experience would be best for me and over delivered.  I had the best time of my life and loved the electric bike.  They really care about their customers and they understand its not just a business but an experience.  Great job and I will definitely be back!!</Review>

<review>I was strolling along with the wife and we decided to check out renting some bikes.  My wife wanted more a regular bike and I wanted to be able to use some power.  The bikes let you do both (and they DO carry non-electric bikes too for rent).  After trying both, we went electric since Eddie advised we don't do 1 electric and 1 non-electric.  The ones we got don't have pedal assist - it was only pedal OR throttle.

Eddie was VERY friendly and helpful.  He provided a paper map and gave us some tips on where to relax, etc.  The rates are very reasonable - they don't offer a half day rate but if you rent it for 3-4 hours, it ends up being the same or less.  PLUS I think the other places charge you up front whereas these guys charge you when you return (and seem to be flexible on how they track time).  They also may have a discount depending on which hotel you're staying at.

They lend you bike locks and clean helmets.

Thanks, Eddie!!!

I would highly recommend!!<//review>< pics>

So my family and I were looking for something NEW to do in San Diego and we thought we would rent bikes and go for a ride. On our way to the bike rental place I saw a sign that said "electric biked" and said... BETTER! :) Just incase we got tired or peddling if we went too far.

So we meet this really awesome guy names Sean who not only took a good amount of time explaining how things worked but also gave us a more than fair rate and got us ready for our ride. Also providing helmets for the children and a special seat for my 2 year old.

Never rode an electric bike before but all I can say is that it was easy! It was set so I can peddle and throttle the power if needed. Just a wonderful bike to ride.

I can not begin to tell you how much FUN we had! Yes, it was an awesome time but more important we bonded as a family and that was the most special part. This is now our NEW family thing and Sean is our guy. THANK YOU Sean for everything and see you again soon!

We bought our new Intercepter platinum from Sean Chavez May 2020.  Sean made it a very easy and pleasant experience! He went way out of his way to accommodate us even coming to our house to help us with our new awesome bike.  Highly recommend San Diego Pedego and Sean Chavez!< /text>

My wife and two daughters rented bikes for a ride along the bayfront and really enjoyed the experience.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful getting them set up. Rental rates were very reasonable, and the bikes were easy to use.  They loved the electric assist!  They came back a second time that week with my son and me, and the whole family enjoyed a ride together!<//text>

< Review>
An experience everyone should have.   I'm 62 and my wife is 67 and we both felt like kids again as we racked up about 8 miles on these great bikes.   The rep and owner Sean was VERY helpful and informative.  He took the time to fully explain the bikes and the controls. I absolutely recommend this company for anyone wishing to experience an e-bike.  You won't be sorry.<//Review>

<review>Stopped by to get my first test ride on an e-bike.  Sean was very helpful and accommodating, even though I wasn’t making a purchase that day.  No high pressure sales, just a lot of useful info and some very high quality bikes to try out.  Parking can be a hassle on the SD waterfront, but they give you a voucher for the garage that is right behind the store, couldn’t be easier!</review>< Pics>

< Review>
I left a great review of this company on Yelp earlier, and don’t mind sharing that it was alot of fun! Sean was very good at getting us going on the right bikes. They are so easy and effortless. Our 13 year old daughter loved it and so did my wife and myself. San Diego is a great place to be outside and enjoying the views and the people. The bike paths and scenery is so great along the bay shores.<//Review>

<Review>I’ve been to this bike shop twice the last two years while vacationing to San Diego. We rented a tandem and rode down the waterfront to the Coronado Ferry to go across to Coronado. After that we ate lunch then rode the tandem to Imperial Beach. The electric assist tandem really helped even though we are experienced tandem riders. Sean took good care of us and provided maps and route suggestions. There’s a bike trail all the way from the Coronado Ferry dock that goes under the Coronado Bridge and down the Strand to Imperial Beach. You can ride back the same way or go back up the east side via Chula Vista and back to San Diego which doesn’t involve another ferry ride, but the east route is mostly industrial.</Review>< response>

So my family and I were looking for something NEW to do in San Diego and we thought we would rent bikes and go for a ride. On our way to the bike rental place I saw a sign that said "electric biked" and said... BETTER! :) Just incase we got tired or peddling if we went too far.

So we meet this really awesome guy names Sean who not only took a good amount of time explaining how things worked but also gave us a more than fair rate and got us ready for our ride. Also providing helmets for the children and a special seat for my 2 year old.

Never rode an electric bike before but all I can say is that it was easy! It was set so I can peddle and throttle the power if needed. Just a wonderful bike to ride.

I can not begin to tell you how much FUN we had! Yes, it was an awesome time but more important we bonded as a family and that was the most special part. This is now our NEW family thing and Sean is our guy. THANK YOU Sean for everything and see you again soon!

<Review>My girlfriend and I come to this place specifically to ride the tandem bike around town. It is so much fun and also leisurely! I recommend it alot, with a tandem bike it is so much easier to talk to each other and we don't have to worry about seperating.

Sean is very helpful.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

I had a phenomenal experience renting ebikes from Pedego San Diego. Sean and the other staff are really friendly and made me feel like a regular. The location is right on the boardwalk and they offer 1 hour of validation at the attached Marriott parking garage.

Edit: Changed to 1 star from 5 in hopes they will see this.
I left a 5 star review after their first email asking to leave a review. Since then I've received 6 emails and 2 text messages asking for a review "if I had not done so". I've tried unsubscribing to their email but their link leads to a non functioning page. I have also tried emailing them back to no avail.

Edit#2: problem has been fixed!< /Review>

Sean was great in helping us find the right pegedo bike for our family of 3. It was our first time using the bikes and we wanted to rent it to explore San Diego with our young son. He took his time in explaining the use and what trails to use. We look forward to using them again in the future!< /review>

I would highly recommend Pedego bikes to anyone but absolutely to momma’s and families with kiddos. We had a fabulous time thanks to the Pedego team member Sean. He made sure we had the perfect bike, a bike bag to put our diaper and travel needs in and an infant seat that kept my little one Happy all day long. He also recommended a beautiful bike ride to Liberty Station where there were lots of waterfront views, open pathways, playgrounds for the kiddo and delicious foods at the market. I am grateful we decided to stop in and check this place out. We LOVED our experience and Pedego will be a staple for all our family vacations to San Diego moving forward for sure!! Definitely check it out if you have a few hours. It’s worth it! It will be the highlight of your trip. Trust me!< /text>

<Review>This guy made the feel of old fashion customer service feel normal. We are passing through and he still treated us like his long term regular clients. They got us in, parts ordered and installed in a day or two.

Fantastic location for this store, and such a great young family making a go of it. Bravo.  And here is wishing you all the best. .

Sean at Pedego San Diego helped my husband and I purchase new Pedego's just the way we wanted them. We had rented Pedego's on Catalina Island years ago and it was so much fun. We talked about purchasing previously and happened to stop by Pedego San Diego spur of the moment one day. Super glad we did. Sean is awesome and knowledgeable about everything Pedego. We decided to purchase 2 City Commuters (26" step thru and 28" classic). We have so much fun every time we go out on them. We are always thinking of where we will go next and look forward to the next ride eagerly. It is like belonging to a new family with all the other Pedego owners. Thanks Sean for changing our lives. HELLO FUN...........
We just had our 100 mile bike tune ups done so when we dropped off the bikes for service, Sean gave us rental bikes to use for a few hours while he worked on the bikes. This was great for us (being from Temecula, CA) so that we didn't have to come back another day to pick them up. Sean serviced the bikes the same day and we got to use the rentals to go and ride Balboa Park while we waited. Awesome.............<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Excellent solution to get around the beaches of San Diego without effort. We rented two bikes for 24 hours and the staff was very kind in recommending the correct model to ride even in the evening. He also let us park our car for free for a whole day in the covered parking of the neighboring building (value $ 45). The bikes are very powerful, comfortable and easy to use even for those who are not trained. The rental price may seem high, but in my opinion the service is absolutely worth the money!

(Original)
Ottima soluzione per girare la zona spiagge di San Diego senza fatica. Abbiamo noleggiato due bici per 24 ore ed Il personale è stato gentilissimo nel consigliarci il modello corretto per girare anche alla sera. Ci ha pure fatto parcheggiare gratuitamente l’auto per un giorno intero nel parcheggio al coperto dello stabile limitrofo (valore 45$). Le bici sono molto potenti, comode e facili da utilizzare anche per chi non è allenato. Il prezzo del noleggio può sembrare alto, ma a mio avviso il servizio vale assolutamente la spesa!</review>< pictures>

<Review>Great local establishment that's super clean, has so many different items and they have amazingly friendly staff. I love the convenience of being able to pop down the road to get almost anything I need. No need for long coast trips anymore! Thanks< /Review>< pics>

I have been going to Dr Retch for over 10 years for my psoriasis. He is great and informative. My skin had clear up with his recommendations. All the staffs from the moment you enter front desk nurses are welcoming and really nice. I highly recommend California Skin Institute.<//text>

The first time I went this place was seeing DR. Longmire for my moderate contact dermatitis. When I asked her what caused this she said she wouldn’t know. And she didn’t recommend me to go check my allergen. She proscribed me topical steroid and samples of Vanicream (which contains ingredients later I found I was allergic to) and let me schedule a revisit in two weeks. One day prior to my revisit, they notified me that the doctor wouldn’t be here and I can see one of the PA here. So the PA Yolena (not sure if I’m spelling her name right) saw my skin for few seconds and said I had rosacea. She proscribed me Metrogel which also contained ingredients I was allergic to. So imagine using peanuts to treat patients with peanut allergy. My face went like a ballon and I went straight to Urgent care two days after. When I called the office about this, the receptionist was actually very nice and helpful, he went back and forth to confirm the answer of my question. And this time, Yolena said she can proscribe me doxycycline. I told her many times I was nursing during our visit. This was the part truly made me angry!! How can you proscribe oral antibiotics to a nursing mom!!!!!! Luckily I knew what doxycycline was and I immediately refused to get it. The whole experience caused me too much trauma, physically and mentally, I’m still seeing help because of the trauma this caused me. I’m not going here again.< /Text>

Dr Florec is a big disappointment. She shaved my mole which grew back. They made me go to all of their locations to figure out what next and charged me a bomb for their 5 minute consultations at all locations in which they just explained their goof up. I am sure the front desk people could do that better than their doctors. Overall, they are a bunch of people making money by cheating people.< /review>

<Text>Dr. Bernard Recht is one of the best docs you can find. His energy, ability and genuine desire to help his patients are superlative. He has very helpful staff as well to support him.
Hilarious side note: His office notice board says wearing masks are optional, provided you undergo a temperature check. Unfortunately they only have rectal thermometers left in stock! 🤣😂< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1612845156601, 'text': 'We take pride in delivering top quality care here at California Skin Institute.

<Review>I really like Dr. Recht.  He has great sense of humor and a wonderful bedside demeanor.  So I keep going back to this office.  But I have to say, the office is horrendously late, always!  There has not been a time where my appointment has not been at least 30 minutes or more late.  Which is a real bummer, because the doctor is fantastic.  I wish they would take people's time more seriously and come up with a better scheduling system.  Because I am a working professional and taking time away from work to sit endlessly in a lobby is not acceptable, I can't give the operation more than a 2 star.  Dr. Recht would get a 4.5 by himself.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808fb6e866a28005:0x94374724e3bf1cd7</gmap_id>< userid>

Great doctors, but financial department charge twice for the same and is very slow when fixing that. So when thinking to go there, take into account the time you'll spend fighting with them to get the charges right.</text>

<text>Dr. Longmire is very friendly and knowledgeable! She explains everything thoroughly. The staff is quick and efficient. I am so happy that I discovered the CA Skin Institute, as I was able to get an appointment quick. The location is clean and Covid practices and social distancing is enforced at all times. Definitely looking forward to my new skin results!< /text>< UserId.>

CSI is wonderful! I have done numerous skin treatments at multiple locations. Each visit has been on time, the nurses/doctors/staff are friendly and I am always made to feel very comfortable. The level of care is very good and they are excellent about follow ups and reminders. Highly recommend!< /Text>

Even after the doctor showed up, she left in the middle for something else within a few mins! tried to get the checkup done as best as I could, but the doctor seemed distracted and in hurry. Got some basic prescription written up but not a pleasant experience at all. Not sure if due to covid stretch or just general.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
First time I went to this clinic. This physician, Dr Recht is super thorough and very pleasant. The staff, Alicia, and Yasmin were also very warm . I mentioned to Dr. Recht’s assistant that he is very nice and his assistant said he treats the staff very well just like he treats patients.

I really did not want to see a physician bc of my COVID concerns, but they wore masks, screened me including taking my temperature and all patients socially distanced.  I give the place a grade A, and I am not related or know anyone at that clinic.<//Review>

Update 2/21:  No wait time today, and Dr. Recht is still the absolute best!
I have been going to Dr. Recht for many years.  Sometimes the wait for him is long, but I know that he takes the time he needs with each patient, so if that means I wait for my turn, I’m fine with that.  He is a highly skilled physician, has treated my skin cancers successfully, and he has a great sense of humor.  I cannot see going to anyone else even though he is not part of my usual medical group.</text>

I've been getting my annual dermatology exam from Doctor Recht for at least 10 years. He's always polite and  thorough.  He answers any questions or concerns that I have. It's so nice to leave with peace of mind.<//review>

Dr. Wilson at California Skin in Sunnyvale is wonderful. I just love her. She takes time with her patients, she listens, she's friendly and she KNOWS what she is doing. She has an artist's eye when she does dermatology and she takes the time to make the best cosmetic adjustments and improvements for YOU. She isn't there to just sell you services or products that would waste your money. Dr. Wilson looks at you and suggests what would be best for you to look your best. She stays up-to-date on the latest tools and techniques in the dermatology field. The support staff are very caring, attentive, skilled, really friendly and they all get along - it's just a very welcoming place. The whole office is knowledgeable and efficient. Dr. Monique Wilson is so very good and has a wonderful team backing her up.</Text>

<text>I had a great appointment with Dr. Recht at California Skin Institute today. He looked at my skin and told me what to do to clear up my problem. He answered all my questions and even told me about a website to find the lowest cost medications. The staff was friendly and there wasn’t a long wait time.<//text></record>

<Review>I first visited Dr. Wilson back in Dec. 2018. Her staff was very helpful. I definitely had so many questions and concerns about the results I was trying to achieve in regards to my skin pigmentation and how I would get there but Dr. Wilson was such an amazing person. She took her time to explain what procedure would best fit me, she ensured I felt comfortable with the treatment plan. Her staff is beyond wonderful- Alicia, Melissa and Nancy have been such a blessing. Melissa being the front desk has helped me through the finance process to ensure I am okay with prices and that I am able to afford services. Nancy has made the procedures definitely much more relaxing with her wealth of knowledge along with Alicia. I definitely recommend Dr. Wilson and California Skin Institute!!<//Review>< pics>

Unfortunately, there is no zero star option. I am really upset because the doctor prescribed me a medication that is a tiny tube for $600 that insurance won't cover just because a pharma company is pushing that brand new medication to the market and she is likely getting a cut for prescribing it. Also, it's not available at any pharmacy! The pharmacist told me there are many alternatives though that have been in the market much longer and are much cheaper. But the doctor will have to change my prescription.< /review>

Melinia Honjo is a great Dermatologist. She was quick to diagnose and provide the right treatment to me. Whatever instructions she gave were very useful and the treatment was successful.

This clinic has the cutting edge technology which helps the patients a lot. I recommend this clinic to others for all kinds of skin issues.< /Review><UserId.>103257593498549128873</UserId.>< Date>

I've visited this place today for the hair fall problem. I'm a new patient, I have made an appointment for one doctor and examined by another doctor. I don't want to reveal the doctor names but the receptionist was pathetic. About doctor she is not even considering or listing my doubts. She has recommended some shampoos and solutions and asked me to back after two weeks. I was tried to explain one of my concerns of my visit and she told me that "I'm running late and we could discuss the issue in next appointment". So doesn't she charge for my today's consultation ?What I observed in my visit is they are willing to charge the patients and they will ask us for come for one more visit for sure(to make more money :( ). After my consultation I have checked the receptionist , what would be the charge per consultation and she replied that "Doctor must know about the charge" but unfortunately doctor was already left because of her another works.
I would definitely not recommend this place for any of the patients.</Review>

<Review>I was pleasantly greeted at the door by Melissa today who let me know Dr. Recht would be with me very shortly. Dr. Recht took great care of me, as always, addressing all of my skincare concerns and needs. But what makes this place so great is their cohesive unit of hardworking ladies in the front office. Jennifer, Alicia and Melissa are professionals that seem to take their jobs seriously, but simultaneously personable and respectful women that make me feel at home and without stress. This ability to put the patient at ease is so important in a place where patients are there to address the oh so stressful issues that tend to hit our skin. I wouldn’t go anywhere else for my skincare needs! 10/10< /Review>< time>

<Review>Alison is the skin esthetician that I saw today and she saved my skin. I have been breaking out pretty badly and I am so glad she has come to the Sunnyvale location. I was also suffering from dull skin texture. She is god-sent and she knows what she is doing with skin. She knew right away what was good and bad for my skin and essential cleaned out my face. I left with a smooth bright face! Seeing her again in 3 weeks. Can’t wait !</Review></record></dataset><record>

This medical clinic is dishonest and charges the insurance company for the services that were not provided to the patients. They have been constantly harassing me and have charged me $1350 in cash so far for a claim that they submitted for only $940 to the insurance. My co-pay that insurance recommended is only $54. Also, the doctor gave me free samples but later charged my insurance company pointing that samples were treatment given to me. I have not seen such abuse of access and ability to submit the claim in any other medical practice and this is not what America stands for. It is a shame on the name of our country that medical practices like this exist. I have reported them for fraud to my insurance as well. I have also sued them in small claims court. I see a lot of negative reviews on the Yelp and could totally relate to it.<//Text>

< Review>
Money Grabbing Institute - I visited Dr Wilson for a so called 'Free Consultation"! Instead I ended up paying $135 in fees.  I purposely made it clear at the time of visit that my concern was acne scarring and they said it was a complimentary consultation.  What I didn't know if I discussed acne I would have to pay $135 in consultation fees. Beware! There is no such  complimentary consultation!!!  Very disappointed!  Also the services they offer are much cheaper elsewhere!</Review>

<date>1560465858374< /date><rate>4</rate><review>Giving 4 rating based on doctors kindness and treatment. Thanks a lot to doctors. Initially by looking into hospital and their treatment I thought its expensive but not, fee is quite reasonable. Only issue is with staff and their behavior. Not remember young lady staff name but her replies and questions always upset myself. For example in my next visit(daughter) she is asked 'still you covered in the insurance, living in same address'....sounds like absconded case :(  I said I am in the same place with same insurance and posses same job and able to pay :) Also she warned my son as he is moving around and touching the items in display. Few kids are bit hyper active and some times we need to excuse them (If there is any loss, I will agree to pay). I strongly advise staff should posses kindness on patients and their attendees and do not insult/doubt their financial capability in front of all because you guys already took copy of my credit card and I signed on the document and allowed to charge in case of no pay :)<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1561696519665, 'text': "Hello, we really appreciate your feedback!

<Review>I saw Dr. Wilson for Fraxel (1927 for pigmentation) and was very disappointed with the results.  I've had two Fraxels before so I knew what to expect and what was reasonable.  Dr. Wilson used such a low setting that I didn't even peel.  I didn't notice any results and this was after two previous Fraxels where I saw *dramatic* results.

I asked Dr. Wilson which settings she used and got very defensive and said that she used the best setting for my skin.  I said I wish I had been included in the decision to use a very low setting, which she thought was very unreasonable.  I told her I wasn't happy with the result and she flashed a before/after photo in front of my face very briefly and said "Well I see a difference!" and that was the end of that.

She said that if I wasn't happy I could see one of their other doctors to get the procedure done again, which isn't any kind of consolation, given that I'd have to pay the full price (again) and take time off work (again).  Saying "Hey you can just buy it again" isn't helpful!

I really feel like I wasted lots of money and three days of PTO and they just didn't care.</Review>< pictures>

While the first contact with cps however unpleasant the situation was that lead them to knock on my door was, the social worker who came treated me and the situation with dignity and respect. The subsequent contacts with the following older women were absolutely prejudicial and inappropriate at times. With one, I was literally harassed and bombarded with two separate workers to receive "services" and later bullied by one to sign a contract. As in, the worker sat on my couch and refused to leave my home until it was signed, despite the fact that the contract was supposedly "voluntary". Further an another contact by another older worker was met with near hostility and threats of their ability to remove my children.. (please note an initial contact was with a supervisor who clearly stated that despite the public opinion of cps they were not about removing children but rather keeping children safe in their home), upon receipt of the records of the last contact, (you have to petition the court at the juvenile hall fyi) the worker unethically misconstrued several statements and failed to report several contacts made via phone, and stated to the father of my child, that if cps were to remove my children by means of him making a complaint, its would be obvious that they would be placed with their father. She equally closed my case given the lack of evidence, "substantiated" the claim without sufficient evidence, and will hopefully hear from her supervisor after I make a formal complaint. Its never a positive thing dealing with child protective services, but the unethical, and abuse of power that was given makes them incapable in my opinion to remember what their job was in the first place. As one supervisor told me, workers are still people, some are good and some are bad. But maybe if I ever do come across any again, I'll be sure to remind them that unlike some of their other cases, I'm not only surrounded by mandated reporters myself, but am in the wait list for a county job that requires me to mandate report.<//Text>

Several members of my family, including myself, called to report abuse. However they did nothing about it. It had to come to the point that my sister was trying to kill her kid before CPS did anything.</text>

A lot of you are complaining about abuse of power and I have yet to see that. If anything they don’t do their job. They will just believe whatever the crackhead parents tell them and that’s the end of it.< /text>

What a pleasing experience using Virtual Latinos.  They selected great candidates’ base on our initial interview and then sent us resume for each potential candidate we selected.  They then arrange video conferences with the candidates we wanted to interview.  The selection process was seamless and all handled by Virtual Latinos.  We are currently using the candidate we selected with great success.  Extremely dependent, grasped our accounting needs right away and immediacy become a complement to our existing staff.  Communication with our new assistance is outstanding and we couldn’t be more please.  We expect to use them again in the near future.</text>

Jaime Nacach and all of the staff at Virtual Latinos are consistently professional and client-focused. Their process to discover what type of VA will best serve you is structured and thorough, ensuring that you'll be matched to the best of the best. I was matched to three candidates who were all outstanding and am very pleased with my new VA. You will be impressed every step of the way.< /review>

A great community with amazing job opportunities! The Virtual Latinos team is so helpful, positive and professional. Working as a virtual assistant has been a great experience thanks to them. The hiring process is very well organized and we have the chance to work for companies that are growing. As a virtual assistant I get to work in the same time zone as the client which is a great benefit to all, apply my knowledge in my work and give great results.

Very thankful and proud of being a part of Virtual Latinos!!!<//Text>

<Review>I've had a great experience working with the team from Virtual Latinos. I registered as a Virtual Assistant on the page in June and always looked for jobs that fit my profile. Eventually, they posted a position on the page in August. I applied and got hired. This job doubled the income I was making at the time doing customer service work from home. The team is very supportive, and though one has to read and write a lot to create the profile, this is also a way to make sure that only the best professionals make it through. I would recommend anyone register on the page, whether it's a business looking for a virtual assistant or a professional offering their services. The company is growing super fast, a lot of people are getting hired, and many new clients are looking for virtual assistants through them. There are usually quite a few positions to apply for, depending on your professional profile and experience.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< name>

I love working as a VA with Virtual Latinos. At this point due to the pandemic, working from home is the way to go. My first job proposal was sent by mid October 2020, and after posting to several open positions I was hired at the beginning of January 2021. Couldn't be happier. Thank you VL</text>

They are organized, always on time and very responsible. I´m happy that I found out about virtual latinos, that I belong to his great community and the client I´m working with and my colleagues.

My experience as a virtual assistant for Virtual Latinos has been exceptional. The VL team has always supported me with everything plus they make all processes very professional and effective. The client I work for is also a great person and one of the best bosses I have ever had. The truth is there is no comparison to the quality of work being a virtual assistant compared to a job in South America. Thank you for this great experience and I am very happy to be part of this community!<//Review>

<text>Honestly a real game changer for our organization. We run a non profit and cost is a concern. We started with the hiring process and in matter of a week we went from 1 assistant to 2 to doubling the hours we originally had planned on.

The company is run very professionally, the cost is amazing, the assistants go out of their way to get the job done and my only wish is that we started with them sooner!

<review>I heard about Virtual Latinos through a colleague and joined the community in early spring 2020. It was not until the summer of the same year that I started applying for jobs and achieved a full-time position in a month after actively submitting job proposals.

With Virtual Latinos, I was looking for a supportive community that assured you a smooth transaction in the job-seeking, hiring, and onward client relationship process as this can be tricky when negotiating your value as a professional.

I was also looking to expand my geographical scope of work and embark on new opportunities in other professional fields. Thanks to Virtual Latinos professionalism of their team members and rigorous process (regarding joining, applying, and being an active member of their workforce once you get hired), I was able to fully transition from office work to remote work.

Virtual Latinos is setting a precedent for how work looks and will look like. Their focus on the client-virtual assistant success relationship and approach to satisfaction is down-to-earth, amicable, and also, attentive.

I want to thank the Virtual Latinos teams for being fundamental is this transition!< /review>< Gmap_id>

Working with Virtual Latinos has been nothing but a great experience, they are extremely professional and will always have a solution to any problem you have.

I've been a VA with them for over 5 months and my experience has been great, one of their main focus is customer success and they are always giving pointer into how to improve the quality of our work with the clients.

To anyone who needs a VA, Virtual Latinos is your best bet. Can't recommend them enough.</review>

Working for Virtual Latinos has been one of the best experiences of my life. I love how everyone has their position defined, therefore the recruiting process is excellent.

All the information is very clear when applying. They even help you on how to do things so you can get the position! It's amazing!

I loved the process with them, I feel part of a community, a family. I love the opportunities they offer and personally, my client is great. I have learned many things from her and I love working with her.

Virtual Latinos is the best recruiting platform! Fully recommended.<//Text>

Hello! I am from the Dominican Republic, and today I am the Digital Marketing Specialist of a Property Management and Real Estate company in San Diego, CA thanks to Virtual Latinos. Without them, this opportunity would not be possible. And guess what! this is the second job opportunity I got. The first one was a small Facebook Lead Generation project, and now I am working as a Full-time VA.

They are professional, kind, and efficient. Everything is super organized, and they are a huge team always active to support your needs.

Ezequiel, Julio, Sharon, Roberta, Daniela, Jaime, Jen, Cinthya... They are all amazing!

Highly recommended to job seekers and employers.  100%</Text>

Virtual Latinos has helped me with with every step of hiring a virtual assistant. They have great customer service and have really helped me find the help that I needed so that I could focus on the tasks that I need to be focusing on and growing my business. Before I hired a virtual assistant through VL I couldn't keep up with emails or all my to-do's. Now I feel more at ease and glad that I have the chance to work on what I need to work on.< /text>

Working with Virtual Latinos as a Virtual Assistant has been a great experience, all the staff members of VL are very attentive to the clients' needs as well as our own (potential and current assistants). Working with one of their clients has been a great opportunity for me to use my administration and customer service skills to provide a better experience for their costumers as well integrating myself seamlessly to an international team (I get to practice a bit of my French as well). All of the assistants that form part of VL are very proud to be a part of a team with such high standards and excellent human quality as well as to represent the quality of service and preparation that characterizes our Latin community.</Text>

Finding VL this year has been the best that could have happened to me, the team that Jaime has built behind this awesome community is wonderful. All of them are always willing to help and really care about all of us since we are accepted in the community. They care about us, as internal clients, as much as they care about the US clients for who we work.

The recruitment process is so well-organized that when you are finally hired, after a lot of effort, you and the client can be pretty sure that the relationship is going to last since VL assure throughout all the process to get the perfect match for the abilities and skills the client needs in order to perform all the tasks required satisfactory.

This experience has been awesome and I would definitely recommend VL to any US company and to all Latin American workers who want to live an unforgettable experience!</Review>

<Text>I have been part of the Virtual Latinos community for over a year now and looking back, I feel extremely lucky I found such a great organization. The team is always helpful and guide you through every step of the way. My fellow virtual colleagues are professionals who strive to give our clients the best everyday. This reflects the selective process in order to have the best VAs and makes me proud to be part of the team. Most importantly for me, I am extremely thankful I found work through Virtual Latinos. Latin America is a tough place to find stable job opportunities and yet we have so much talent to offer. I am glad Virtual Latinos exists to bridge us together all over America. As a VL client, you can rest assured Jaime and the team have you covered. As a VA, you can count on the team for guidance or assistance. My life has changed for the better, thanks to Jaime and VL.

<Date>1606498080308</Date><Review>I've been working with VL for a few weeks now, after being accepted as a potential assistant 2 months ago. They are a very welcoming company where one feels to be among friends since day 1. The VL staff does go the extra mile to give you the best tips on creating proposals of quality, and even instructions on the how-to's for everything.
As for the added value VL offers, I think it is awesome: companies in the US and Canada can hire skilled labor at low wages compared to those paid locally. Virtual Assistants (the hirees), on the other hand, are paid in USD or CAD, while living in their own country, meaning we get a high value for our work, given our countries' standards.
I really recommend any young professionals, as well as free lancers to try Virtual Latinos.< /Review>< rate>

Virtual Latinos can be defined in many ways professional, friendly, team oriented. My experience as part of the group of VA's has been incredible they guide you and help you during every step of the process until you grt to work for incredible clients who treat you with great respect. if you are trying to apply you wont regret it, it takes time so prepare to be patient it is all wortwhile.</Text>

I really like the fact that Virtua Latinos takes time to screen people, also that this is the most and foremost formal company  I ve worked for.

<review>I've been working with VL for 10 months (and counting) and I'm really thankful for what I've experienced so far. The platform has many job offers, and new ones are published very often. It's a nice job opportunity for the entire bilingual latino community.< /review></record>

I strongly recommend this platform for anyone who needs high quality workers in the same time zones as the United States. I have hired around 8 people from this site, and I am continually impressed with the skills these assistants possess and their advanced level of English.  Language was never an issue, and these workers followed complex sets of instructions with little to no error.  In addition, the support staff for the platform is extremely responsive and accommodating and the site is very easy to use.  I have nothing bad to say about this service.</Text>

Saving all of the 20 interviews we would have to make. Such a great system!! ... My star Melanie is mine..Sorry, and I know there are more. She translates documents, learned and guides the email campaign platform, handles basic social media needs aaaaaaand. All of the things we want our teammates to do is dependent on how good with provide the information and the support to make sure they have what they need...The quality people are here, if you are a good boss, they will be amaze to you..And I also got lucky with my star... Think about this... Melanie works 80 hours a month for me. 80 hours of work I could not have done, because I was working my 40 hours on my own...Because Jaime, and Virtual Latinos brings you the best of the best, we really get a chance to lay out our dreams and goals to our employee, and watch these brilliant people express themselves... Jamie and the team are always there for you..Literally i'v sent him 100 telegram and emails messages. every sing one..100% of them were answered promptly. I am very pleased. very...

When I received the information for the first time about how the process was, I did not find it very encouraging. But in retrospect I can tell you that it has been a long and tedious process to enter; it helps to really see the quality of staff they are looking for. The team is excellent and I support you in the process from the beginning. And when you already work with a client it makes you think like you haven't applied to a home office long before. I recommend that people who seek to apply be patient and in the end all the effort and work is rewarded. Highly recommended!

Nelson

Llevo casi un año trabajando para Virtual Latinos y puedo agregar que la experiencia ha sido muy buena. Cuando me llegó la información por primera vez de como era el proceso no me pareció muy alentador. Pero ya en retrospectiva les puedo decir que ha pesar que el proceso para entrar es largo y para algunos tedioso; ayuda a ver realmente la calidad de personal que buscan. El equipo de trabajo es excelente y te apoyo en el proceso desde el comienzo. Y cuando ya trabajas con un cliente te hace pensar como no habías aplicado a home office desde mucho antes. A las personas que buscan aplicar les recomiendo que sean pacientes y al final todo el esfuerzo y trabajo es recompensado. Altamente recomendado!

Worst dentist you will find, bad human being. Amir Jamsheed and Dr Wang messed up 3 of my teeth causing infection and pain that cost me thousands of dollars to fix. They have low prices but you get what you pay for there and believe me they should be paying you after the pain they and trouble they cause. Not good people and never had an experience like this so wanted to share.</review>

Dr. Jamsheed is seriously the best! I’ve been going here for about a year now and I couldn’t be happier with my dental hygiene. I used to really dislike going to the dentist until I found Encino Dental. The entire staff is incredible and very personable. I’ve already referred a few people and they couldn’t be happier with their experience. Go here, you won’t regret it!<//review>

Dr. Amir and team are always very friendly and welcoming. Your treatments will be reviewed with you so you understand and you can always ask questions without fear. All my treatments have been quick and painless and I can't imagine going anywhere else for dental care.</Review>

I called this morning to confirm our dental insurance is accepted and after two calls back and forth they confirmed that our dental insurance was accepted and mentioned nothing more.

We were given a same day appt and I dropped off my wife 10 minutes after appt.

Once there she was told that our insurance takes 6 months to process. Later when she was in examination room on chair with doctor she was told that her out of pocket cost was 150.00 ... kinda like a shark!

We were clear from the beginning about our insurance and we could have been given the choice on the phone or once she arrived not on the chair.

This is a tactic used often by tentists but due to good reviews here, we thought this dds would operate ethically but no ... they just can't be straight and honest.

Appt with DDS is worth the 150 but not the BS and the way they do business.

UPDATE: I called our insurance and was advised that they don't take 6 months to process and their usual processing is 7-10 business days.

This office could have told us that a visit fee applies if they had a problem with our insurance.

RESPONSE:

"care until their insurance benefits kick in or until reimbursement is made to the office. Once reimbursement is received, a credit/reimbursement payment can be made to the patients account which is always explained to our patients."
NOT EXPLAINED OR THE NORM
THEY HAD THE CHANCE TO FIGURE ALL THAT OUT BEFORE MY PREGNANT WIFE ARRIVED.

Co pay or visit fee, Just ask for the money.<//Text>

<Response>{'time': 1612923679761, 'text': 'Hello Ali,\nThank you for the review, and so sorry to hear about this experience that your wife had.  At our office, we take our patients needs and chief complaints very seriously. As such, when a patient comes in with a dental concern, we do everything possible to take care of that patient and their immediate needs. We do not allow insurance companies to hinder our ability to treat our patients and provide them with the best quality care possible. We do offer to look at your benefits as a courtesy as we are not responsible for understanding your coverage and we do require all payments to be made up front.\n\nOne thing to consider is that many insurances carriers have copays and or waiting periods which can hinder the coverage they provide. In these cases, patients will have to pay out of pocket for their care until their insurance benefits kick in or until reimbursement is made to the office. Once reimbursement is received, a credit/reimbursement payment can be made to the patients account which is always explained to our patients. In addition, co-pays still apply as coverage is not usually 100% for everything. This is something I would advise having them explain in more detail to you as your insurance provider.\n\nThat being said, it sounds like things went wrong here and we would like to address this with the patient and make things right. I can’t take up your circumstances here online due to patient privacy protection laws, but would love to speak to the patient about what we can do.  Please have the patient contact me – my name is Rosie and I am the Financial coordinator. Hope to hear from the patient soon.'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

Excellent Doctor, and very professional stuff - my germs have significantly improved after the treatment (need one more visit), and I have only a couple of smaller new cavities after they did initial fillings 3 years ago that doctor fixed on the spot.

I have always avoided the dentist. That was until I found Dr Amir and Encino Dental Studio. I came in with horrible wisdom teeth pain on a Saturday and he did a thorough exam, took his time to educate me, and best of all.. he got me out of pain. His extractions were fast and painless. I couldn’t even believe that it was over because it was done with such ease. The staff are all friendly and professional, especially Annabelle who helped with the finances and I felt like I got received quality work for a reasonable price. I will def be returning and will stay with Dr Amir for a long time!</Text>

I’ve been going here for a few years now. Dr. Amir and everyone on his staff is friendly, trustworthy, understanding and reliable. They’re serious about the health of your teeth and they also care about you as a person. I’ve stayed loyal this office since 2016, even when I lived an hour away last year. Dr. A took all 4 of my wisdom teeth out for me when I was 29 years old and even though I was nervous about it, he kept me calm and did an amazing an efficient job and was very supportive in the healing process. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to write a review!<//review>

I had been living with pain in one of my teeth (under a crown) for years and Dr Jamsheed was the one who was finally able to diagnose the problem so we can start toward a resolution of my pain. I’m a nervous patient and they offered me sedation for my extraction. Very positive experience with everyone in the office.<//Review>< Pics>

Highly recommended.
Our first visit from Encino Dental Studio was based on positive reviews on Google and Yelp. Now, after several sessions of treatment, I strongly confirm the positive reviews that you are reading in the Google and Yelp about Encino Dental Studio. I have had four kinds of treatment (Filling, Crown, Extraction and Deep Cleaning) in this studio and I am very happy to choose this place because of perfect treatments and fair prices.
Dr. Amir Jamsheed in addition to his Proficiency is a very kind man. Staff are great and responsible and you will face a very hospitable atmosphere in this studio. The building has valet parking and they validate your parking then parking is free for you!<//review>

Excellent experience at this office.  Today was my second visit - the one after your dental assessment so this is where the work really gets started and frankly I don't think I'll ever go anywhere else.  I'm terrified to go to Dental offices but Dr. Jamsheed, his hygienist and the entire team are absolutely wonderful.  This is my new dentist office....Period!  I highly recommend this office.< /text>

The best dentist I’ve ever met! Dr. Amir is so gentle and extremely knowledgeable, with excellent bed side manners. Honestly, will stay with this practice for life. Staff is also super warm and welcoming.  Had dental filling and crown done. I’m so happy with the outcome. Very polished and natural look. Most importantly, I did not feel any pain during the procedure. Dr. Amir is simply the best. Well worth the drive if you’re not from the area. Definitely highly recommend to anyone in need of dental care. You can’t go wrong here. Five stars all the way!</Text>

Dr. Jamsheed. He and the staff are very welcoming and caring.  They helped put me at ease, because I came to him to remove my left bottom wisdom tooth after my terrible experience of a dentist in santa monica who took two hours to remove my bottom right wisdom tooth and tried to remove the bottom left one under local anesthesia.  When I came to Dr. Jamsheed's office, he and his staff reassured me that he has amazing experience with extractions and that I had nothing to worry about.  Believe when I tell you, Dr. Jamsheed removed my wisdom tooth in less than 3 minutes.  I was like ... that's it?  You are done?  I felt like crying because I went through so much struggle with the last dentist.  I felt good and I was so happy.  I am definitely making him my dentist to take care of my dental needs.  He is honest and sincere.  Thank you to Dr. Jamsheed and his wonderful staff for making this place my new dental office.  Be well and be blessed.

I had my teeth and dentures checked. The staffs are fantastic, the two dentists who gave me an examinations are amazingly friendly and very informative. My x-ray, I automatically see it. Dr. Amir is the most informative, modern and lovable dentist who ever examine me and the clinic is absolutely clean, the devices being used to my mouth are extremely clean (wrapped still and for sure it is sterilized). Thanks to the entire Encino Dental Studio employees specially to Dr. Amir Jamsheed, DDS. Have a very happy day everyone.< /review>

Awesome job and excellent personnel 😊😊

The doctor did an excellent job - both professionally and fast! They explain what they do and do it right the first time ☺️!

Amir was able to address my concerns and answer all my questions - and prepare a personalized plan what needs to be done.

It only took me 2 visits - I will definitely highy recommend Amir and the hygienist 😊😊😊

I am so thankful that I came across Dr. Jamsheed. He and the staff are very welcoming and caring.  They helped put me at ease, because I came to him to remove my left bottom wisdom tooth after my terrible experience of a dentist in santa monica who took two hours to remove my bottom right wisdom tooth and tried to remove the bottom left one under local anesthesia.  When I came to Dr. Jamsheed's office, he and his staff reassured me that he has amazing experience with extractions and that I had nothing to worry about.  Believe when I tell you, Dr. Jamsheed removed my wisdom tooth in less than 3 minutes.  I was like ... that's it?  You are done?  I felt like crying because I went through so much struggle with the last dentist.  I felt good and I was so happy.  I am definitely making him my dentist to take care of my dental needs.  He is honest and sincere.  Thank you to Dr. Jamsheed and his wonderful staff for making this place my new dental office.  Be well and be blessed.  S. Madison</Review>

<Review>I have been to other dentists, but the level of care and attention provided Amir (and the rest of his staff) at Encino Dental Studio is unparalleled. I would highly recommend Encino Dental Studio for anyone looking for a great dentist who explains everything that is about to be done performed.
I had some work done and was called the next day for a follow up by Joy. They truly care for their patients.</Review>< rate>

<Review>Had awesome experience getting braces with Dr Jamsheed. He was gentle and made sure my teeth were moving properly every step of the way. I come all the way from Irvine to see him. When I come he gets me in immediately and he really takes the time to educate his patients so they fully understand what they need. He has appointments on Saturdays which a huge plus for me! I recommend him to anyone I know!!< /Review>< date>

I had tooth pain for a few days. I Finally caved and called for an urgent appointment. He fit me right in the same day! Turns out I needed an emergent root canal for an infection. Within 24 hrs I had the root canal and it was a painless experience. He and the staff were super accommodating and nice. Put me at ease. Highly recommend him.< /review>

I called in with a swollen face as a first time patient on a Saturday, and I ended up needing a tooth extraction! The office was closed but I originally just came for an examination for he swelling . Dr. Jamsheed was so friendly  and careful with the procedure and his assistant she did the most wonderful job of keeping me calm during my shots especially. She held my hand the entire time! I am so grateful I called into them specifically everyone present took such good care of me, they even made sure since the day was so odd I could get home safely. I am very much so looking forward to my follow-up appointment!< /review>

I had the worse pain ever! My wisdom tooth was coming out and I had no idea! Since not knowing, I procrastinated until I felt like it was an emergency @ 4am!

I was able to call first thing in the AM and get an appointment for a few hours later.
Before you know it, I was fixed up, patched up and good to go! More importantly, the work done was quality & CLEAN!< /Text>

After searching so long for a dentist, I have finally found the one I am comfortable and happy with.  Dr. Jamsheed is very respectful and kind. His staff is honestly the best I have seen. They would talk me through my entire process of getting renewing my crown and also made sure I understood everything about my appointment today. I had to renew a crown and had a fill in. I told the doctor that I was on a super time crush and I had to pick up my kids at noon and he made sure I was out of the office within 1 hour. It was so quick and easy. During the fill in the staff would ask if I was comfortable. I am glad I found this office! Thank you Dr. Jamsheed and his entire staff!
They also validate your ticket downstairs so you don't have to worry about your car during your visit. Great experience and will recommend to everyone I know!< /Text>

Dr. Amir is a true pro! He makes you feel very comfortable, discusses everything prior to doing the work and honestly never tried to upsell you anything hung you don’t need. My teeth and gums thank you sir!

The staff is incredibly nice and helpful as well, ask for Jessica, she helped me with all the billing and scheduling questions and made everything very easy and clear.< /Review>

Friendly caring staff, committed to excellence in hygiene and prevention of dental maladies. Dr. Jamsheed is very thorough and careful. I haven't had good experiences with dentists growing up but the haunting memories we're washed away with his dental check up. He not only describes the science and nature of the problem but he goes above and beyond to provide ways to prevent future disease.  This place is a gem and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you missed seeking dental care here.  (I asked around in the neighborhood and the prices here are extremely reasonable, even if you don't have insurance like me)<//Text>

Incredible! Love this place. Dr. Jamsheed is a quality doctor. Very professional, straight forward, and friendly, and his staff is very inviting and friendly as well. He works with you and your dental goals he makes the dental setting a very cozy place and relaxed. I did my ortho treatment with him and will still continue to treat with him for my dental needs.< /text>

<review>I was very impressed by the staff at Encino Dental. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. I had a whitening treatment and am very pleased with the results. Dr Jamsheed did an exam first to make sure there were no issues with my teeth before the treatment. Adrian did the whitening procedure. He was very professional and patient in explaining each step of the process. The care and concern shown by both Adrian and Dr Jamsheed was exceptional. I would definitely recommend them!
(They also validate parking, which was much appreciated.)< /review>< UserId.>

Thank you so much Dr Jamsheed ! Super gentle and comforting. You and Maryam made my experience great and not scary. Maryam is very ”mom like ” wich made it easy to trust her . You and your team are very professional and warm . I went from having the shakes in the waiting area before my first appointment, to now having ZERO anxiety about a visit. He treated me with such respect and put my mind at ease. And he is not some kind of assembly line shark who wants to encourage the most expensive work he can convince you to do. He is everything a Dentist should be . He is super gentle, I can’t recommend him enough.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Dr. Jamsheed and his staff are beyond wonderful! No one likes going to the dentist, but in this case, I'm looking forward to my next appointment! I felt at home as soon as I walked in the door. The sweet girl at the front desk is on top of it and calmly so, and she's the sweetest thing! Dr. Jamsheed is so smart and knowledgeable, he makes sure you completely understand exactly what's going on. Everyone there makes you feel so safe and comfortable, and they take the extra step to go out of their way to help you. It almost felt like I wasn't there for an appointment, but I was talking with friends! The office is exquisitely clean. It's a very calming environment, almost like a spa. I can't express enough how wonderful a dental experience could be! I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Jamsheed for your next trip to the dentist. You will never be disappointed.< /Review>< rating>

Dr Jamsheed is amazing, overall. He explains your treatment very well and makes sure that you have an understanding of dentistry and also your treatment . Gives you options depending on what you need. Staff is very friendly and caring. I had two crowns done by Dr Jamsheed and they look so natural, I couldn't be anymore happier with my dental work. I will for sure be coming back. Not to mention but prices are reasonable for the area. Prior to Dr Jamsheed I shopped around for deals and this was the best that I was able to afford and the quality I can't even finish explaining A+++.< /review>

< Review>
The food is well enough but they never cook the fries properly. They are not crispy like they usually are,  they are slightly undercooked.  I was looking forward to the crispy French fries, that's the whole main reason for McDonald's.</Review>

<text>Zero!!!!!!! OMG! Unprofessional, I left my car to pick up my order but they said I have to come with my car to pick up my order! I had to wait 45 minutes to get my order at 3pm on Thursday! It is not a busy hour to give just one burger!  They really need training to improve their customer service! She slammed the window front of me!!! How could you treat your customers like this!!! Need to change the manager as well!!!<//text>< rate>

I haven't had any of their products since 2004. The last thing I had of theirs was a "breakfast burrito" of some sort. We ordered there out of desperation because there was nothing else open in Dallas that early on a Sunday. It was absolutely disgusting, inedible. It's been deposits only for me in their locations ever since. I do have a large banner of theirs that says "McWrap". I took it because everything they offer is McCrap and the irony was not lost on me. Not sure who still eats their products or why. Have they not been to an In-N-Out yet?< /Text>< Pictures>

I've used the app to order here this time. When I arrived, they had no order for me on their system. So I reordered everything and paid again... (The manager said I would have to go through the app to get my money back from that order.)  And pulled up.  Anyway, while I'm waiting for my second order to arrive at the second window the manager comes up and tells me, 'Your other orders just showed up on our system.  I'm just going to refund your money from the first order now and get your current order. And then I sat there at the second window (where she said to go and wait...) and waited for about 7, 8, cars behind me in line, get their order and drive off before I drove around back to the front and ask them if they forgot me.  As soon as I drove up to the window they had my order ready.  The employees were very nice here, but I can't imagine going back here anytime soon right now...</Text>

<Review>It's strange reviewing a McDonald's restaurant because......well.....it's McDonald's.  However I came here to put in a good word because in comparison to other McDonald's restaurants in the greater area, this one seems to be exceptional.

I can't seem to remember anything missing from an order.  The cashiers seem to be on the ball.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, their Cafe Mocha is always hot.   I will SHARPLY contrast this with Lafayette where the Cafe Mocha is always luke warm with all the chocolate syrup sitting on the bottom of the cup.  I've stopped going to the alternative completely and take the slightly out of my way Monument to hit this one.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record>

This is the closest McDonald's to us, unfortunately. This store does the bare minimum. Our food is either wrong or missing more often then not. I have ordered a double cheeseburger, only to get home and find that  one of the meat patties where missing, even though the wrappers where correct. They never mix the Mcflurrys! It is so frustrating that I get a mess of ingredients do to either laziness or lack of training! Management needs to step up. I will go out of my way to not go to this McDonald's.< /Review>

This McDonalds is literally the only one where each time I’ve gone I’ve had excellent service and high quality food. Every time order is correct, food is hot, and actually tastes and looks fresh. I don’t know how the magic happens there, but it’s great.</Review>

So I try to stay away from fast foods but if you have kids and you need fast food and it's quick and it's easy then McDonald's is a place to go is definitely a lot cleaner and better than the rest of the fast food restaurants.

<Review>I go here often & they frequently mess up my order. I pay 3$ extra to have an additional item on my sandwich & they never put it let alone make it correctly in the first place. The worst part is they had me park to wait for my order in the first place. I’ve wasted countless $$ here & fast food is suppose to be cheap & convenient. Ridiculous.<//Review></record>

Horrible customer service.  Ordered $30 worth of food on mobile pick up and when I got there they told me they dont have the order . I showed proof of my order as well as payment and they told me they can't give me my money back or my food.  Manager was a lady and was very rude and unhelpful. Currently on the phone now with customer service help to get my money back</text>

It's McDonald's, so you know why you're here! You're not here to eat healthy, or count calories, you're here to treat yourself! They've got all your favorites but the standout for me now is their fresh beef quarter pounder burger. You can get in a double but a single Patty suits me just fine. The best thing about this is waiting longer for the beef to cook, which is a nice change from ordering the food and eating it a minute later.<//Review>

My French Fries were cold, the large Coffee nearly burnt off my Tongue. I sat in drive thru Lane for at least 10 minutes. The customer service was rude. I will never go there ever again. I rather starve!<//Text>

This is the closest location to me and the food is always so dry!!
The buns on the burgers taste like they have been left out for days. Manager needs to start managing the staff better because this should not be happening!< /Review>

<text>Rude female workers. Manager speaking Spanish in front of English speaking customers. Drive-thru female gave me dirty look and turned away while waiting for service. Only person who cared was Jason and he was being treated poorly too! As a woman, I was very disappointed with the female crew. Jason deserves a better work environment.</text>< date>

I wish I can give zero star. It’s the worst customer service I ever had. Went at night to Drive-through. The worst experience ever, with employee has an attitude. Long hair Very filthy very filthy Not clean.Cost me more than eight dollars for a biscuit and eggs no meat with the hash-browns. Don’t go there.< /review>

<text>You know most places are always give 5 stars because I've lived around here for so long that everywhere I go I've been to a hundred two hundred times so I know it's going to be good. Unfortunately that's different fast food restaurants. McDonald's started having these great sales during Christmas for Big Macs for like two bucks and you get a big old meal for six bucks and I kept that going for like 2 weeks and at the very beginning it was really good. But towards the second month I don't know if management or something but all sudden everything was coming out cold and see how it could be with some pastors they can be great one day and completely different than that so hopefully management will fix it back going it's a great McDonald's as beautiful as they have great for you set inside for kids a great little playground. So it's really fun for the kids and it's brand new it's got a big parking lot even has electrical plugins for electrical cars at this McDonalds. Probably the first ones on Monument so I was trying to find something good to say. I stopped eating fast food because I ate so much for 2 months and it's a bikini like 15 lb first time that made me overweight I've never been overweight and all sudden I had a belly. so you know it's got the kids and all that it's now it's McDonald's it's going to be good enough that's for sure and they're still having some pretty good sales going on. That was a thing with me and McDonald's is ever out they got so expensive compared to the other ones but they have been having some really great sales lately so why I went there quite often the last couple of months but I couldn't believe the way that game so I was like no I'm not doing that anymore but if you have kids you know of course go enjoy buy electric car and that's where you're going to go to Target<//text>< Pictures>

It's okay. They need to work on keeping the table clean. Other than that this place is okay.
*SAFETY WARNING*
There has been an increase in homeless & shady looking people out front of the door. So be careful.<//Review>

It's okay. They need to work on keeping the table clean. Other than that this place is okay.
*SAFETY WARNING*
There has been an increase in homeless & shady looking people out front of the door. So be careful.</Text>

New edit: they actually raised the prices so it's now more expensive to eat here with using the kiosk machines.  Make sure you use credit cards to make their cost go up.

It's a Mcdonalds, quality is ok when you can get food.  They no longer offer customer service and you can only order thru their kiosk machines, and you dont get discount using them, still same price despite not having employees helping you.  Many people in line to order at kiosk machines but lady at counter was unhelpful and wouldnt take my order, she said I had to use kiosk machines and can no longer have an employee take my order.  I dont recommend going here, it's too bad I liked their fries but I guess no longer.<//Review>

Been going to this location for years. This place has a good crew (usually-sometimes new hires are a bit iffy, but they generally don't last long). Only gotten the order wrong once or twice in all the times I've  been there and they're very quick. Thanks Monument McDonald's!</Text>

I am not a McDonald's fan, but this is a good one because it is brand new and clean inside and out. They have a full-time custodian (Luis) tasked with nothing but scrubbing from the dining room to the kitchen and from the outside to the restrooms.

They have a modern indoor play area for the kids with a bit of climbing stuff and some electric/electronic stuff.

Wi-Fi and electric vehicle charging pods are available.

The building is about a three years old and they have already slurry sealed and restriped the parking lot a couple of times so it looks brand new again. It is LEED Certified.< /Review>

While taco bell across the street has a 1.00 complete menu. Very long wait time in drive thru at night. Almost every employee here has a cell phone in their pocket and some are texting while working. Free food and drinks are being handed out in drive thru and front counter to family and friends. Some rude and unproductive staff. Men's room was unsanitary. Bums, crazy and unstable people come into this establishment. Mostly a fatty high calorie expensive menu.

Went there at 10:40, they had both menus up so I ordered the qrt pounder meal. Fries were great, Coke was great, qrter pounder was flavorless and Luke warm. Service was rude and slow. They never said hi, thank you, or repeated the order, never said the amount. I asked for catsup and mayo at the second window, she nodded, then when she handed me the bag it had black pepper packet and a mayo. No catsup. They did supply about 30 napkins lol, I guess I looked like I would need them. The drive through was really slow, just one car ahead of me. Very disappointed in this McDonalds on Monument Blvd in Concord on 12/12/18.< /Text>

Went there at 10:40, they had both menus up so I ordered the qrt pounder meal. Fries were great, Coke was great, qrter pounder was flavorless and Luke warm. Service was rude and slow. They never said hi, thank you, or repeated the order, never said the amount. I asked for catsup and mayo at the second window, she nodded, then when she handed me the bag it had black pepper packet and a mayo. No catsup. They did supply about 30 napkins lol, I guess I looked like I would need them. The drive through was really slow, just one car ahead of me.

<review>8/5/20 - 2 stars

So when you order on the mobile app you can no longer go inside to pick up, and you can't change this option once selected. So if you don't pick curbside delivery and enter your strap number, they make you wait in the drive-thru line which today took a total of 18 minutes after our order was placed. So we are left with cold fries in our car right now...
Oddly, they were able to walk a drink out to us but the girl said she thought we already got our food and did not walk food back out but instead directed us to go through the drive-thru.
Wow...  Totally love cold fries... doesn't everyone?

3/5/18 - 4 stars

This McDs remodeled itself maybe a couple of years ago now. Opened up with a beautiful new building. However, at the time of the remodel, they removed the chocolate flavor from their swirl cone. So now, it’s vanilla only, rather than vanilla-chocolate mix. But aside from that disappointing change, everything else has been an improvement.

The dual drive thru lines are great, even though some other customers have no idea how to merge politely. But not a big deal since you never seem to be in the line long anyhow, as food comes out hot and fast.

We weren’t the only ones thinking about ice cream sundaes and shakes last night; the car in front of us had the same order. Vanilla swirl cones ($1.62 each). So good!<//review><Rate>4< /Rate>< Time>

<text>Mobil order app left me sitting in their mobil app parking spot for over 30 mins before i went inside- which was embarrassing bc I wasnt dressed appropriately, hence why i prepaid my order, to have it brought outside to me!! Then noone seemed to care about my order bc they could find the stupid code in their system!! Left me standing there looking stupid all the while helping other customers and never even checking in between with me or on order!! Finally I asked again, the girl said she didnt have any order in her system and proceeded to try and dismiss me again and I said you need to get your manager up here before you help anyone else bc I'm done waiting! Manager did come up, still couldn't find order but she looked at my phone verified i did everything correctly and excussed herself bc obviously the mobil app isnt working correctly and promptly got my order together and apologized again. Told her thank you but please address your front staff bc they made a frustrating situation almost turn into a gone postal situation.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

8/5/20 - 2 stars

So when you order on the mobile app you can no longer go inside to pick up, and you can't change this option once selected. So if you don't pick curbside delivery and enter your strap number, they make you wait in the drive-thru line which today took a total of 18 minutes after our order was placed. So we are left with cold fries in our car right now...
Oddly, they were able to walk a drink out to us but the girl said she thought we already got our food and did not walk food back out but instead directed us to go through the drive-thru.
Wow...  Totally love cold fries... doesn't everyone?

3/5/18 - 4 stars

This McDs remodeled itself maybe a couple of years ago now. Opened up with a beautiful new building. However, at the time of the remodel, they removed the chocolate flavor from their swirl cone. So now, it’s vanilla only, rather than vanilla-chocolate mix. But aside from that disappointing change, everything else has been an improvement.

The dual drive thru lines are great, even though some other customers have no idea how to merge politely. But not a big deal since you never seem to be in the line long anyhow, as food comes out hot and fast.

We weren’t the only ones thinking about ice cream sundaes and shakes last night; the car in front of us had the same order. Vanilla swirl cones ($1.62 each). So good!< /text>

The set's where sticky and asked over and over to get them wiped. The worker's ignored us eventhough they saw us, for a few minutes no one was waiting to be served but us. It's the neighborhood isn't the best I witnessed a fight in this particular one.< /review>

<Text>Oh my god this place is the worst McDonalds  EVER! They always forget something in drive thru, I refuse to eat inside. The place is always smelly and poor upkeep. I love that it shows variety in ethnic customer service however it does become annoying when he employees have attitudes. The managers are the worst employees. There is only one employee that is good. I know he is African American and I think his name is Brandon but Im not positive.<//Text>< pics>

I order a strawberry pie and they gave me a pumpkin pie which I didn't asked for so I told them and they began to argue with me which is something really unprofessional and rude to do to a customer. On the other hand they tried to make it seem like I was a lier when I had my receipt and it was on their menu.

Really unsatisfied with the cashier named !!!!!!!!(DOLCE)!!!!!!</text>< userid>

<review>They cant get a single order right. Forgot half my order and then told me i never ordered it; even after showing them on the receipt that i indeed had. Saw three people ahead of me in the drive thru throw their food or drinks back and then drive off. These people are morons.< /review>< response>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Today I went with my family to eat and everything was fine, the only thing that was not right was that I ordered a Chicken Grills Burger and when I opened it inside before eating it they gave me pieces of tomato and this should not happen in a restaurant of beata category why the customer is paying for a good service or go out with this, the management should really take a letter in the matter why we ask for something good and they are not giving what one expects them to give for the payment of the service, and to add to the matter the bathrooms of very dirty men and do not have a baby changing table something that in every company must have

<Text>(Translated by Google) It gives a lot of courage to ask for something and that they understand you a totally different one !! I ordered 2 BIG frappes! and 10 nuggets ... that was all my order and they came out with (9 nuggets, 2 large coke and 2 small frappes with a different flavor than what I asked for! when I repeated several times what my order was for the same reason that They are always wrong and this time that I told them what my order had been, they only told me “Come back to train in the drive so that they will charge you for your order again.” After having already paid for something that I did not ask for.

(Original)
Da mucho coraje pedir algo y que te entiendan otra totalmente diferente!! pedi 2 frappes GRANDES! y 10 nuggets ... eso fue todo mi pedido y me salieron con (9 nuggets ,2 cocacola grandes y 2 frappes chicos de un sabor distinto a lo que les pedí! cuando repetí varias veces cual era mi orden por el mismo motivo de que siempre se equivocan y esta vez que les dije cual había sido mi pedido solo me dijeron “Vuelve a formarte en el drive para que te cobren tu orden  de nuevo. 😡 después de ya haber pagado por algo que yo no pedí .<//Text>< Rate>

(Translated by Google) I usually do not usually eat in junk food places, but I must say that I was surprised at what McDonald's is becoming because it has a modern combination of friendly service and a more modern space with the options you have to order, both the direct classic with a person and the new one with these stationary modules where you order and now, but at the same time a personalized, friendly attention and a nice and quite clean place, I can say that I liked it, I just think that its quality is far from being fresh and healthy, but as I always say that is my humble opinion.

(Original)
Por lo general no acostumbro comer en lugares de comida chatarra,pero debo decir que me sorprendió en lo que se está convirtiendo McDonald's pues tiene una combinación moderna de servicio amable y un espacio más moderno con las opciones que tiene para ordenar,tanto la clásica directa con una persona y la nueva con estos módulos estacionarios dónde ordenas y ya,pero al mismo tiempo una atención personalizada, amable y un lugar agradable y bastante limpio,puedo decir que me agradó,tan sólo creo que su calidad esta lejos de ser fresca y saludable,pero como siempre digo esa es mi humilde opinión.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Mack Duck as usual on top. But there is no familiar Russian menu. There is practically nothing that exists in Russia. I always thought that poppy duck is different from other establishments of this class in that you can always come and quickly eat the same sandwich that you ate yesterday, a month ago or a year ago. And his taste will be just that. But in the USA this is apparently not the case.

(Original)
Мак Дак как обычно на высоте. Но нет привычного меню России. Практически ничего нет, чего есть в России. Я всегда считал, что мак Дак отличается от других заведений такого класса тем, что всегда можно прийти и быстро съесть тот же сендвич который ты ел вчера, месяц назад или год назад. И вкус его будет именно такой. Но в США это видимо не так.< /review>< date>
