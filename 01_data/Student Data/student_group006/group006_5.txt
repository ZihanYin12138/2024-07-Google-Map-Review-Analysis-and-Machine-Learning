<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>10/10, LIVV was absolutely phenomenal! I’m a first time patient and was greeted, seated, onboard and hooked up to an IV in about 1/5th the time it would haven taken me to get a Starbucks coffee. The staff is professional, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive, and the space is so comfortable with a great vibe and music. The overall experience was more like a five star retreat than a wellness center. Will definitely be coming back!</Text><Date>1620174750390<//Date>< userid>

LIVV IV Lounge is a beautiful and calming atmosphere, the staff is always friendly and helpful. I see Dr. Zand for my very complicated chronic illnesses. He is amazing! Dr. Zand is highly knowledgeable, very present and kind and understanding. I completely trust him with my health care, he breaks down the lab results and always helps me understand them and what our next plan of action is. I appreciate getting to see Dr. Phan around at LIVV he is always so welcoming.<//Text>

< Review>
I googled Best IV Vitamin therapy in San Diego, here the first recommended place was LIVV Little Italy, and man how glad I am i found this place. The staff , the environment, and the services was beyond perfect. The doctors were so kind and welcoming, they made sure they answered all of questions and more. And on top of all this perfection; I didn't feel any pain when the doctor inserted the needle for the IV VITAMIN. I’m hooked for life now, it's been almost a week and I feel so good, my energy levels are over the roof top, my mood is beyond amazing and also I can't wait to go back and just enjoy the experience all over again. I am so glad LIVV Little Italy and their doctors exist. Thank you doctors and staffs for such an amazing experience.<//Review>

<text>LIVV little Italy is AMAZING! I normally am so afraid of needles and they made me so distracted and i didn’t feel a single thing. They continuously kept checking on me during the IV to ensure I was OK through the entire process/ needed anything. The nurses & employees did a fantastic job on making me feel at home and safe. I will definitely be coming back and back 🖤< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

They had a special for a free small bag, so I went with her and gave it a shot. It was simple and easy and everyone was really nice. Afterwards, I felt *AMAZING*! I literally have not felt that good in years. It gave me a lot more energy and improved my mood, which was an unexpected benefit. I’m back 10 days later for another one and imagine i‘ll keep coming back. :)< /Text><user>110887470951793279501<//user>< rating>

I was searching for an IV Therapy Center.  I found LIVV on Instagram.  I was impressed with the marketing and services that were available.    I met Mel first talked to her about coming in then I walked in on my birthday on 5/12.  I received excellent services.  I was able to get a FULL consultation and treatment.  All this during Shelter in Place.  I also want to mention Dr. Kellen Shade.  She was amazing.  She made me a delicious cup of hot tea.  And was able to answer all my questions.  Thank you so much Dr Kellen.< /Text>

If you're feeling sick, give the cold buster a try! The cold buster is the real deal and made me a huge believer in IV therapy. Stopped the cold right in its tracks. Nearly all my symptoms went away after my IV and came back home with a lot more energy. Next time I get sick, I'm definitely coming in for a cold buster.<//Review>

Not going to lie, I was skeptical getting an IV since I don't do well with needles but my friend took me and I am so happy I went for it! The process was painless, the staff was so nice and attentive with tea and the space itself is beautiful! People were just hanging out reading a book or working on laptops while getting IV's, which made it feel like a cool futuristic cafe. I felt amazing after and was all ready to travel (I always get dehydrated while flying) so going forward LIVV IV Lounge will definitely be incorporated into my travel routine and for a health boost in general! Thanks to the staff for making my IV experience so awesome :)</Review>

Beautiful new space in Little Italy run by knowledgeable and caring medical professionals. I have gotten two IVs from both Dr. Phan and Dr. Black. They made the process painless, comfortable and very enjoyable. Felt great after both and will definitely be continuing treatments. Their philosophy on health and wellness will help you be the best version of yourself and make sure all your systems are functioning at optimal levels.</Review>

When I came down with the flu recently, (what seemed never ending) I remembered this place existed and I was desperate to feel better! Staff is awesome, space is chill and cozy. Almost felt as if I was just hanging out at a friends house for a little conversation. For the first time in over a week I finally had some energy and relief!

***fast forward 3 weeks from my first experience and I feel a cold coming on. Going back for the second time today!<//review>< pictures>

The second you walk into the space you feel at home. One of the coolest clinics I've ever seen. If you're in need of an IV in San Diego you have to give LIVV a chance. You won't be disappointed<//review>

Can’t say enough about this place the staff here are amazing and Dr.Phan is one of a kind. I was a little hesitant about getting an IV but after receiving my first IV I feel amazing.

The world needs more places like this where doctors care about their patients and take the time to learn about their patients and help them get their health back. Easy 5/5 love everything about LIVV<//text>

<Review>LIVV has everything from an amazing office and team to great services and products. I came in for an IV bag and left with a few great natural products -- one of which was called "Soul Drops" -- amazing! They offer free health consultations that I strongly advise taking advantage of next time you stop by!</Review><gmap_id>0x80dc01b8e80c5785:0xaea4c4adc6a528d8</gmap_id>< pics>

<Text>LIVV is where it’s at! This is the first doctor I’ve encountered that actually listened to what I had to say and discussed my issues in depth before reaching for any prescription pad. When it had seemed to me that most of the doctors I’ve visited were either working overly efficiently to meet strict insurance quotas or were only writing prescriptions for the sponsored drug of the day, I had to try something different, and that difference was LIVV! As an athlete, I want my body to operate as optimally as possible, and the team at LIVV really broke down, in detail, what it will take for me to do just that. I would recommend LIVV to everyone, but especially to those that want to take their health seriously!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

I had such a wonderful experience, my friend referred me and said to ask for Dr Jason Phan. I went in to explore and research more information on the different IV therapies they provide (I ended up having the LIVV Energy IV with the Glutathione booster). Dr. Jason and the team are very personable and approachable; they went into great detail about the different treatments they offer. This facility is warm, welcoming, and beautiful aesthetically with a comfortable atmosphere to be yourself.< /review>

I went to visit Jason last week to get some blood work done and do an IV therapy session.
I have to say it's one of the best things I've done. As a health coach it's important to me to feel good. Jason helped me to go over my labs and establish a baseline so when I check in future months I can see how I'm doing. A lot of times we self medicate with supplements and things which I know form experience is not smart. I'm happy to have someone to bounce ideas off of and help me on my journey.
Also if you are in the area and can do an IV treatment, then do it! It's a game changer....
Jason is honest, practical and well informed.
Thank you<//text>

Such an amazing space of healing! The IV vitamin drips are the best in town. Feel a rush of energy immediately. I travel a lot for work so the revive bag is great for jet lag and when I’m hungover. LIVV is the best IV Lounge in San Diego. Definitely recommend & refer all of my friends and family to LIVV.< /Review>

If you want the most effective and ground-breaking regenerative medicine, then you come and get treated by Dr. Phan! While training jiu-jitsu, I was SLAMMED on my shoulder and heard a loud POP! I was scared of looking at the damage that had been done (dislocations or compound fractures are no joke), but I was lucky to walk away with just a severe AC sprain and excruciating pain when moving my arm above my head. I did not want to resort to pain killers or surgery as options to treat the pain, which is why I chose Prolotherapy. After getting just a few treatments, I was able to return to training, at full capacity, in about a month! Thanks to Dr. Phan, I am able to lift weights and continue to train in mixed martial arts without any pain in my shoulder whatsoever! Dr. Phan is the only person I trust to treat my injuries, which is why he will be the first doctor I recommend if my friends, training partners, and, especially my daughter, were to sustain any debilitating injuries.<//Text>

After much research on IV therapy I decided to try LIVV and I highly recommend. As a full time working mom in a doctoral degree program I needed an energy boost. I was easily able to book an appointment and immediately notice the difference in my energy level and ability to focus. You can easily book your appointments online with helpful reminders. I strongly recommend!</text>

Came in for a PRP Facial with Dr. Black & it really was a great experience. Dr. Black was super knowledgeable about the whole process & explained it every step of the way. It was only a week ago so still waiting to see full results for the PRP facial but so far I have noticed a lot of my deep hormonal acne sorta come to the service & go away! OH- & the spa is SO chic!!!<//Text>

Dr. Jason is the best around. I get weekly IVs from him and that helps me have energy to go accomplish everything I want to do. If I skip a week I definitely can tell the difference.

I went to see Dr. Phan today because I felt very tired and had little energy. I felt like I was coming down with the flu. Dr. Phan suggested an IV treatment and it was really amazing!  I felt better immediately as I was so dehydrated!  Dr. Phan knew exactly what I needed to feel better. Everyone there was very friendly and professional. I highly recommend Dr. Phan and LIVV. I'm looking forward to my next visit and definitely recommend their IV treatments.< /Text>

Dr. Phan cares.  He makes getting the vitamins that your body needs via an IV easy and painless.  Look no further if you want better health, personalized care with the absolute best patient service, and the support of a true professional.< /Text>

10am, called about an IV, within 30 minutes they were at my AirBNB. The doctor had everything in a petite backpack, had me fill out a form on a tablet and administered the IV in ~20 minutes. They even customized the IV as I requested. 10/10 experience and will repeat next time I'm in San Diego.< /Review>

<review>When I was in the process of recovering from a brutal upper respiratory infection, and no antibiotics seemed to be working miracles quick enough, I turned to a more holistic approach, and sought the help of Naturopathic Medicine. There is a crazy statistic that 90% of consumers read online reviews before visiting a business. My thorough research happened upon Dr. Jason Phan of LIVV IV Lounge – owner of 58+ glorious (5.0) star reviews. The proof is in the pudding, as they say, and social proof was enough for me to give LIVV IV Lounge a chance. Dr. Phan offers many services- from facials to IV drips and everything in between. I booked an appointment, which was a seamless process, and when the date of my appointment came, the check-in process was just as seamless. Upon entering LIVV Lounge you are greeted by an aura of calm and tranquility. The receptionist is more than attentive, offering you a unique blend of tea while you wait for your consultation with Dr. Phan to begin. I had no idea of what treatment to start with, so I relayed to Dr. Phan a detailed synopsis of all my bodily aches and symptoms. It was amazing- he doesn’t take notes using pen and paper; He mentally takes notes. He listens to every. single. word you have to say, and he remembers. As the prescribed course for my treatment he recommended the IV Hydration Therapy. He even went as far to customize my very own IV bag. I’ve always had an aversion to needles, but Dr. Phan and his team are adept at inserting your IV, so you don’t. feel. a. thing. It’s remarkable! I sat there comfortably, listening to relaxing music on the overhead, and sipping my tea. Thirty minutes or so passed, my IV Drip was complete, and I was sad for it. I didn’t want to leave! I left LIVV Lounge truly feeling refreshed, rejuvenated, and with more of a pep in my step compared to how I was prior to this appointment. This will certainly not be my last visit. Even if you’re healthy or battling cold/flu season, Dr. Phan and his remedies can make you feel revived! I look forward to my next visit soon!< /review><Name>Lindsay Griffitts<//Name>< user>

I have been seeing Dr. Phan for nutrient IVs and I feel amazing. He is professional, caring, and patient centered. I can't say enough about him! I have been feeling run down and tired due to stress and overwork. The nutrient IV's give me the boost I need and help fortify my diet to ensure I am getting enough of the good stuff in. I immediately feel more calm and relaxed after the IV (I get extra magnesium=chill out IV). I love LIVV :)< /Review>

Going to LIVV is an experience that will leave you refreshed. I've gotten the PRP vampire facial and my acne scars have greatly reduced and the built up collagen has diminished fine lines. I also used PRP in my crown area for hair regrowth- what up Stamos hair. If you don't know what PRP is then ask Dr. Jay... he's very informative and i'm sure it can help you in ways you don't know. The POLY MVA bag is the move if you're sick.  Just go- thank me later.<//Text>

Amazing! I was utilizing Many homeopathic options to try to stabilize my adrenal fatigue and especially my severe lack of energy, with very little reprieve. After my first visit with Livv I felt more renewed, stabilized and energized than I had felt in five years!! (I felt like I did before I had children!) Lol, about 10 minutes after the Immunity cocktail and Dr. Black’s delicious,  Balance tea, I literally felt like I could have skipped down the street! I’ve been an enthusiastic and a fan ever since.

The entire staff is attentive, patient, informative and genuinely cares for their patients, PLUS their extremely steady hands are a bonus. I absolutely love and appreciate the clean LIVV lifestyle brand, and what their team works and lives for.

I’ve visited them for three amazing sessions so far, and I’ve yet to find any other homeopathic teas, tinctures, supplements, diets, etc. that have had a fraction of the immediate benefit for me. And I look forward to my future appointments. Please check their beautiful facility out and try it for yourself.<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I came to Dr. Phan by accident when a mutual friend overheard the shoulder pain and injuries I had been dealing with. Leading up to that point, I had undergone X-Ray’s, 2 MRI’s, and saw 3 different orthopedic surgeons. I was being told over and over the only way to correct my issues was to undergo a surgery called “Distal Clavical Resection” where the surgeon essentially shaved off mm’s of my clavical. To me, that wasn’t a long-term solution, but rather a bandaid that ignores the outlining issues. Dr. Phan introduces me to PRP Therapy, and it has forever changed the way I look at surgery and medicine. I have undergone 7 major injury related surgeries over the years, and it makes me wonder how many could have been avoided using PRP. Within 2 weeks of the injections, I was able to do daily tasks pain free again; things as simple as a push up or taking off my shirt. Within 4-6 weeks, I was 75% recovered and back in the gym after a 4-5 month hiatus. I had gone through a 2nd round of therapy 6 weeks after the 1st. Now, I am about 3 total months out from my 1st round, and 99% pain free through the day. In the gym, I am about 90% of where I was prior to the injury, and there is still time to heal from the therapy. I highly recommend Dr. Phan and the knowledge he is able to provide and recommend alternative, lesser known therapies that WILL help you avoid surgeries and outdated medical practices!</review>< name>

I also got an IV to boost immunity while I waited. We both left feeling confidant in this clinic.

This place is a local favorite and always busy with people relaxing, either having conversations over coffee or reading newspaper. The staff is really kind too. Beanery local sells coffee beans and coffee equipments. Important to mention that the beans are ethically sourced. I like their baked items as well, specially croissant. We moved to a different neighborhood and miss this coffeehouse and Snowbird!<//review>

Love this place, great to grab coffee and lemon poppy seed cookie.   Definitely a local scene, people reading and playing scrabble.   Appreciate they use proper mugs if you are drinking in the café.<//Review>

Really nice well balanced latte, with good pastries. I liked that they have the old guys talking politics and the young tech guys sitting side by side. My only complaint was the creepy music... It was like a sad monster mash hit list.</text>

Local neighborhood coffee shop. Large black coffee $2.35 — not $7. Delicious. TIP: Wesr side of street for morning sun so you can sit outside and sip.< /Review>

After a walk through the California Academy of Science, we discovered is was time for coffee O'clock.  Just a few minutes down the road, we discovered the Beanery on Google maps.  The coffee was perfect, the baked goods delicious and the ambiance a perfect way to end an afternoon.< /Text>

I am a self professed Americano daily drinker and the one I got today was exceptionally flavorful, fresh and dark roasted!! Balance of espresso and little water (not watered down too much)
Very friendly and I ended up picking up a 1/2 lb of organic French roast whole beans. Very reasonable price for less than $9.
While I am on the quest to check out various independent coffee spots, so far this place is ranked #1!<//text>

Double espresso not on right size, too much water. Also, roast too dark. Should allow client to choose different beans for the espresso.<//review>

I been going to Julie since 2010 when she was working at another establishment, her and Mary open this new place and I am very happy. She does fantastic job, my niece got married and I told her that her colors were going to be purple, silver and white and she did a fantastic job combining those colors< /text>

<Review>I really love this place and can't wait to come back and try something new. I had the pleasure of working with Julie. With this being the first time I wanted to try tips, I asked for the square shape. Julie asked if I wanted to try the coffin shape, and she showed me what it would look like, and I was sold! I thought she was fast, and it was fun to watch her make these. I chose this really cool oil slick looking chrome color that is beautiful...but after a ton of pictures, this was the best I could do. (The photo just can't capture how shiny, and how many colors you see) The place is clean, brightly lit, the staff is really nice, and their work truly is nail perfection. My mother in law got a gel refill, and my partner a pedicure, we all left very happy and will be back! (also, great shopping center across the street: Target, Sprouts, Peets)<//Review>< Pics>

Worst customer service ever. Never going back to this place. Nobody in this shop understands english and they have no value for your time. I took an appointment for 2:30 PM and they start service only at 3:30 and it took they bloody 2 hours to finish a pedicure and manicure. That too for the sloppy work. I showed them a nail art upfront and the lady says she can do it. Finishes my pedicure(pathetic job) and then when she gets to my nail she says there's a lighter shade in the nail paint compared to the one on my feet. Bloody. Messed up the whole experience. Never ever going there again. Such a waste of money,time and energy.< /review>

I only trust Julie and her team with my nails. I've always been impressed with how well they do them, how long they last, and all the amazing designs they do on my acrylics. Such great, friendly environment. Would definitely recommend them. They don't shy away from any nail design or nail shape.</Text>

Love this place, they always take their time and make sure they're perfect. I could never find a place where I'm comfortable and this is my place. I've been coming here for months now and I don't wanna go anywhere else. Great pricing also!</review>

<Review>I come in at 5:55pm for an appointment for 2 at 6pm. I was not greeted as I came in and walked to the front desk. I was there for about 30 seconds purposefully making contact with someone right there, and nothing. Another woman walked up and I was asked what we wanted, then asked to sit. My friend comes in a few minutes after me and we wait. 15 mins go by and we're getting antsy, so we just go look at colors. 6:20pm rolls around and another set of 2 comes in for their appointments at 6:30pm and are told there's a wait because a prior group was late and now they're behind and still finishing them up. We weren't told this, we just overheard for the first time. They then decide to leave. Another woman comes in at 6:30pm for her appointment at 7pm, and gets told the same thing, and even was asked to come another time. Again, my party was never told this, so we learned second hand. We weren't seen until almost 7pm before we were seen. I wanted to leave at least 3 times, but we didn't. We should have, because my nails were awful. I understand that when folks have a line of customers, they feel the need to rush. However, this almost always comes with quality taking a hit when they rush. And this was the case. My nails were longer than I asked, even though she said she'd file them down later. An index nail was crooked, and when I asked her to fix it, she couldn't seem to see what I was talking about. I asked for rounded nails with no taper on the sides, and since she put on a nail wrong, there was a taper. I pointed it out and asked if she could leave more acrylic there to fix later, and she reassured me she would. Didn't happen. I wound up going home and redoing my nails myself. Doing so, I found that a thumb was so thin, that it just bent and dented while filing. The hell is that?

Don't let inconsiderate patrons ruin another patron's time. Because of this, I have ZERO intentions on coming back. Which is a bummer because the other person in my party came once before and had a great experience. Her nails were also done way better than mine, so her manicurist didn't let the rush get to her. Wish I could say the same about mine.<//Review>< Pictures>

It is advisable to call for an appointment rather than walk-in due to lots of customer. The service is very excellent and I have no issues since I first come here. I already visited the place five times.<//Review>

I wasn't going to but that's it!!!  It's 6 am I'm stretching,  and my nail breaks in half  . What a joke.  My name is Jai,  I'm 26,  I live in sac.  Despite coming to this nail shop more than enough to know it's a small outdated family business with only one real nail tech I go any way,  USUALLY A YOUNGER ASIAN WOMAN ABOUT MY AGE DOES MY NAILS AND SHE DOES AMAZING.. But this time it was BUSY And an older Woman signals to me too come over, I explain I want a new full set because my nails were so old,  she asks me why and I said They're so old I'm afraid they'll just break off even if you fill them,  which would be a waste of 35$.. She then says she can save them,  I'm like ehhhh kaaayyyy,  she then realizes why I wanted a new set,  and let's me know I'll be paying for a full set.  Fine.  45$$ +tip. ... Thee very next day..  My middle nail popped off in the car door,  the next day after that my other middle nail chipS off in the screen door,   not completely gone...  THE NEXT DAY IM OPENING A TOOTHBRUSH,  MY THUMB NAIL POPS OFF!!!   A couple days go by and my GEL ON MY OTHER THUMB STARTS TO CHIP???!!   1  WEEK LATER I'M STRETCHING AND POP GOES MY NAIL AT 6 AM. THANKS FOR YOUR HARD WORK.  THEY ALSO WERE BUSY AND KNEW I  LIVED IN SAC,  BUT MAYBE SHE FORGOT ABOUT THE INTERNET.  DO NOT COME HERE,  THEY USED TO CHARGE ONLY 35$  FOR FULL SET WHICH IS WHY I CAME HERE ANYWAY,  NOW THEYRE CHARGING JUST AS MUCH AS EVERYONE ELSE THAT HAVE EXPENSIVE MODERN NAIL TECHNOLOGY AND REPUTABLE SERVICE AND THEY STILL DO NOT OFFER THIS.  IF YOU MUST , JUST MAKE SURE THE YOUNGEST NAIL TECHNICIAN WILL DO IT FOR YOU.  She sits to the right  when entering this shack.   SHE'S THE ONLY ONE THERE. ALSO TRIED TO CHARGE  ADDITIONAL 10$ FOR CHROME , WHEN I USED TO COME HERE AND GET CHROME DONE FREE OF CHARGE.</text>

Ok I will do that cuz I didn't want to drive to Snell & Blossom hill to get them done...went to pay and my card wouldn't go thru even tho there's $ and I had just used it.. so had to use the ATM ($5 charge from MY bank for using non bank ATM) so I was slightly irrutated... gave her $60 and she gives me back $15 so I ask how much did u charge me she said $45 I told and pointed to the lady that said $35 the lady said $35 is for SHORT yours are long extra $10....I was really mad as I should have been told $35 & up depending on length! RIP OFF...they are SOOO thin she obviously did not use more product... Very disappointed...With NO prices posted in shop I bet they charge what they feel like charging per person! Prices should be posted for everyone to see what they want to get done IN THEIR BUDGET!< /Text><Rate>1< /Rate>< Name>

Literally walked in an no one spoke or said or anything.  I literally stood at the door asking who works here that could help me. Guess being African American didn’t help!! They looked at me like I was some freak and still said nothing. I was so embarrassed I just left immediately.<//Text>

One .an had his dog without a leash and throwing a ball for the dog to chase.  Everyone else was being conscientious about masks and leashes for dogs as well as distancing.

They talk about how small dogs shouldnt be allowed in the big dog area yet they let there own small dogs run around, not only that they let there dogs bully other dogs and get mad if u say anything to them, the nice people i meet at the park are super cool but have the same complaints</Text><UserId.>105950224996279450838< /UserId.><rating>3<//rating><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

My great grandchildren love this park, however one of them has cystic fibrosis and is highly allergic to dogs. There is a dog park there but more and more people bring dogs onto the children's play area. It is so bad that we can no longer can take her there. I have nothing against dogs but dont take them where they should not be. Maybe a sign saying that no dogs are allowed in the play area.</text>

< review>
We had so much fun this morning with our two dogs. There's a short 1/3 mile path around the dog plus a kid playground and benches. Then there's the dog park towards the front of the park. There's two areas--the small dog area is all grass and has a small pool, and the all dog area is half grass and half dirt with another small pool. There's a few trees for shade too. There's a drinking station and poop bags and cans. We went early on Sunday and there were dozens of dogs and humans there but it didn't feel crowded at all. It was the first time I took my puppy to a dog park and it was a good experience for her because all the owners were responsible and attentive. We'll definitely be back again!< /review>

Smaller park that is maintained pretty well. Has a play area, for kids small walking trail with a few benches with tables and bbq.'s. Two off leash dog park play areas one for large the other small dogs. Most are respectful of the rules which helps to keep the dogs able to enjoy the social experience. Sadly often drama between the pet owners. Restrooms are clean as well and some shaded areas in center of park to sot. Please parking with open desert across if you enjoy walking in the desert solo or with your 🐕 be cautious of snakes.</Text>

<Review>Great little dog park for both big dogs and small dogs. The big dog park has a large dirt area but it also has a grassy area too. The small dog park has both a mixture of grass and dirt. The grounds are well-kept and there's plenty of benches for the people to sit down. Always meet friendly puppies there and really nice people too<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOuAL1Me_Y_eLRMNTQj6Dvf6raHvxZVyG6UsrFl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPZUU3iJcFQTnrt6NdLy1JTmzTow_ZrQnkKQdU_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNvf5sgm-Gg8PAXhiPSyW5CEcRYr59p7SsCh55u=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO0zVHyXFXdQIIxY00TaU2Qc49e8BjiU6h4aK1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

this is such a nice dog park. People who go there are all pretty nice and friendly. I have only had two bad experiences there with people allowing their dogs to fight and having an attitude that your dog needs to know how to hold their own or people bringing their big dogs into the little dog park area. There is a walkway that goes around the entire park and there are plenty of things for kids to play on. I always find a parking too.< /Text>

<Name>Doug T</Name><Review>Love to take our dogs here and let them socialize with other dogs in the off-leash area.  They also enjoy the nice green grass and trees while we walk/run around the walking path with their leashes on.
While we have K9 kids, we do see plenty of the human kind enjoying the play area.< /Review><Response>None</Response>< Rating>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>The park itself is 5 stars.  Most of the dog owners there are responsible, however a few entitled owners do not follow the rules.  They have their dogs off leash (leashes are required), some owners do not clean up after their dogs, and some owners let their dogs drink from the human drinking fountains.  There are doggy fountains there, but I guess those aren't good enough for them.  Bring your own water if you go, and do not drink from the water fountains!</Review><user_id>102565109883477014594</user_id></record>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Best park in the AV!!! Everyone is super friendly and they have a walking trail you can go on. Every three times around it equals a mile and I love that. I always know how much I've walked because it tells you. People always smile and greet you there and say goodmorning or what not. It's a great attmosphere there... I especially love seeing all the dogs there playing or walking around. It's a dog park so they have an area for the large dogs to play as well as an area for smaller dogs. And they have lots of nice, fun playground equipment for the kiddos too.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

The park is very clean and well taken care of. There is a small play park for kids. A walking path that is about 1/3 mile. A few picnic areas.
And 2 separate off leash areas. One for large dogs, I for small dogs. And they have restrooms.< /Review>

Love the dog park.  My dogs love it.  We go several times a week.  There can be some "know it all" dog owners there who love to tell you how to handle "your" dog.  If you can ignore and avoid them, then your dogs will thank you.  Could use more benches and some more trees.<//Text>

Loved it for the most part (my dog had a blast), buuuut there was a lot of poop that wasn't picked up in the small dogs area. Felt like I was walking through a poop minefield. Besides that, it was awesome! Some additional benches and extra shade would be a plus.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80c25b2f51aa74d3:0xd75c8285d40fb8e< /Gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

This is a great park!  There are two fenced in, off-leash areas for dogs.  One of the areas is specifically for small dogs.  The off-leash areas have water fountains with bowls for the dogs.  The entire park is fenced with only one entry point though. There is also a nice playground area and a bathroom.  The park has a large cement walking trail that surrounds a large green.  There are picnic tables and barbecues around the walking trail.<//Text>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>A fun little park. There is a small play area for kids and fenced areas for dogs to run around in. There is a big dig area and a small dog area. I wouldn't suggest bringing your dog if they can't handle lots of other dogs. There is also a walk way around the park with benches and some grills</text>< Pics>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>Nice place to take your dog, I usually meet nice, responsible owners there.  Unfortunately the last time we went some ghetto trash showed up with their German Shepherd mix, which incessantly kept trying to mount our dog. They wouldn't do anything about it, she just ignored it while on her phone and in fact he thought it was funny, saying my dog was a being a tease and putting her butt in the air ( not true, she kept spinning around to protect her backside, also, my 1.5 year old female has been spayed since she was 5 months old, something responsible owners do.) They had absolutely no respect for others, including the children present and no concept of etiquette. I went over to get their dog off my dog as it became embarrassing when it wouldn't leave her alone after several minutes and several attempts by my dog to run away and escape only to be chased down and the process repeated. When I couldn't move her dog off by pushing against him with my knee I lightly tapped him on the neck to re-direct his attention. She came over hollering to get everyone's attention that I hit her dog. We ended up leaving to avoid a scene. Probably won't go back, plenty of other nice places on the west side to go without having to have a confrontation with low class garbage. Maybe take a stun gun, good luck!</Review>< Pictures>

< review>
The park is good sized. There are 2 fenced off, off leash dog parks, one for bigger dogs that has a couple of benches. Its 3/4ths dirt and the rest is grass. Than there is a smaller fenced off grassy area for smaller dogs. The rest of the park is good sized, huge grassy area with trees for shade with benches and one or two charcoal bbqs. There's also a cement path that circles around the whole park. The kids playground is pretty nice as well in a sand pit area. There are men and women bathrooms which are usually pretty clean. The parking lot is pretty well lit as well.</review>

This park has three dedicated fenced areas for your pets. One large area, and a specific area for small pets and a third area if you have a dog that may not get along with other dogs. Large space, has water for the pets and clean up recepticals and baggies.</Text>

I travel the country, and frequently use Google Maps to find good parks.  This one is awesome.  I have 2 and 3 year olds and the park has great play stuff for both.  Baby and regular swings and very clean.  Mostly fenced in with a huge grassy area to run around.  I had fun on the play stuff too :)< /Review>

The park was very nice and 99% of the dogs were very friends.the dog owners were very nice and friendly to The only negetive comment I have is that dog owners should pick up there dogs poop.  The park and rec should also get rid of the bags and add more poop scopers. We will be back.<//text>

Great little park. We come for the dog park. Folks here are usually quite friendly with well behaved pups. The facilities are well worn, but the city always seems to be trying to regrow grass.<//Review>

The park is well maintained, with an area for big dogs and a area for little dogs. There are water fountains for dogs and toys to play with. There is also poop bags and a pooper scooper as well. We were overall very pleased with this park.

Update: this park has gone down hill and we no longer take our dog here.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x80c25b2f51aa74d3:0xd75c8285d40fb8e</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great place to bring your dog, as there is both a small and large dog enclosed off leash areas. Playground equipment is rather new. 1/3 mile path that circles a field. Overall well kept park.< /review>

This park is nice for the kids and dogs for a short period. 1 playground, a few grills, a few benches, many small immature tree's, 2 dog parks with water spouts for dog drinking, and public bathrooms with 2 drinking fountains and a concrete track for walking (.5 mile maybe). The playground has baby and kids swings (4 altogether) and 4 climbing jungle gym thingamagigs (these are fun for the kids). I frequent as I live in Palmdale and own a dog. Close, convenient and clean. Always manicured and dog owners tend to pickup after their dogs waste.</review>

<review>Great place for both pet lovers and family. Two separate dog areas; larger area for larger dogs and the non-shy smaller ones, and a smaller area for the small dogs and the shy larger ones. Everyone is quite friendly in both areas, as long as you mind your pet and your kids. Some owners do not appreciate when others do not mind their pets, and their pets become overly playful; some dogs do not do well with that type of play, and those with very playful pups should be respectful of that.

Play area for the kids is great; newer equipment that keeps the kids moving and interested for a good amount of time.

The rest of the park is a large grassy area that has a walking/jogging path around it for those who want to walk their dogs or get in some exercise. It also has a couple areas for bbq'ing and the grass areas allow for soccer games, football games, etc.

The only downside that I can find at the park is that some parents opt to ignore the no skateboard/rollerblades/bike riding policy within the park, and allow their kids to do these activities. Which, unfortunately, is very bothersome to the people who are jogging, walking their dogs (which become very scared or irritated), and following the rules.<//review><Name>Kimberlee Redding< /Name>< resp>

It's a nice park to bring your kids to but then you have people walking their dogs and not picking up after their dogs they're very lazy and you end up stepping on the dog mess I wouldn't recommend bringing the kids there unless you want them to step in the dog mess some people are just disgusting not picking up their dog mess after the walking their dogs at the park< /review>

It's a nice enough park -- it's a good place to get your dog socialized, even if the small dog area is a bit scarce and muddy.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Small but it is enough to go with your children, to walk and take your dogs to play with other dogs. The area for animals is fenced and is quite wide where they can freely release their energy. The park provides plastic bags, containers and pickers for the dogs' poop and that way we help keep the area clean.

(Original)
Pequeño pero es suficiente para ir con tus niños, a caminar y llevar a tus perros a jugar con otros perros. El área para los animales  esta cercada y es bastante amplia donde ellos libremente pueden liberar su energía. El parque provee de bolsas plásticas, contenedores y recogedores para el popo de los perros y de esa forma ayúdamos a mantener el área limpia.<//Review>

Dr. Berry and the office staff are AMAZING!! I visited  CORE for Prenatal Chiropractic care throughout my pregnancy and I really believe this made a huge difference (for the better!) in my delivery. I continue to visit the office on a regular basis and encourage everyone to try it out! The massages and adjustments are amazing each visit.  Thank you Dr. Berry!!</text>

<text>Love Dr Berry.  I always feel 100% better after Dr Berry adjusts me.  His staff is super nice and everyone is very professional. Very safe office if you are worried about COVID. They take lots of precautions!   I’m so grateful for Dr Berry!  A lifesaver when my back acts up!!!  Highly recommend 😊< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><user_name>Kathy Vochoska</user_name>< Gmap_id>

Our newborn has a sever lip and tongue tie and we had it revised with a local dentist. Dr. Berry was on a list of recommended providers that the dentists provided for bodywork to help with tension due the lip and tongue ties. My baby’s latch has improved and she does seem less tense. More than that his office staff is friendly and efficient at check in. Dr. Berry was very personable and really gets to know you and hold conversation, not to mention how great he is with kids, he was very gentle with my newborn and even demonstrated the pressure he’d use on her as to show me it would not hurt her. He also interacted well with my two year old who wasn’t even getting adjusted. This is a place you can bring the entire family. I would highly recommend!</Text>

The doctors were very attentive to my concerns and focused on providing me with the treatment that I need in an effort to address the actual problems that I’ve been suffering from. They take a wholistic approach to treatment, which I respect and appreciate. I look forward to the continued improvement in my condition and how it will impact all areas of my daily life. Chronic pain can interfere with quality of life and overall health and wellness. For the first time I’m hopeful that I might be able to focus on life, rather than merely looking at what it could be through the fog of constant physical pain.<//Review>

The staff is so friendly & helpful! Dr. Berry takes the time to explain everything and makes you feel very comfortable. It was my first time getting adjusted & I am currently pregnant, was a little nervous but Dr. Berry and the staff ensured a great experience. Will definitely be going here and no other from now on!<//review>

< review>
The staff at Core Chiropractic + Wellness are so friendly and professional. They are very helpful and getting an appointment is so easy, I have been able to get in on the same day at times. I have been going to Dr. Berry for years now and he is the best. I feel great since I started receiving treatment from him, I have way less neck and lower back pain. I sleep so much better now and have way more energy. Thank you so much!</review>

< Review>
I love this practice. The staff is extremely friendly and professional, making each visit super efficient and comfortable. Dr. Berry is amazing. Being 6 months pregnant, I was slightly apprehensive about being adjusted (although I’ve been adjusted while not pregnant) but his personality, professionalism, and amazing bedside manner made me really comfortable which makes the adjustments so much better. I am so thankful for this practice as it’s making my pregnancy that much better.< /Review>

In the midst of this pandemic, I was truly grateful to have my temperature taken before I walked in the door. Everyone had masks on, and there was hand sanitizer available at the front desk. They are taking all the precautions they can to keep their patients and staff protected.

I have been seeing Dr. Berry for several years now. I love this office! Everyone is very nice, from the front office staff, to the massage therapists, to Dr. Berry himself. The office is very clean, and in a good location. If you're looking for a new chiropractic office, you should definitely try this office!<//review>

I first started seeing Dr. Berry in 2012 after a nasty car accident, and another chiropractic care who only wanted money and never applied the individualized care that I needed to get better. It was refreshing to find a doctor that cared about his patients! Actually, even to the point that, though we hadn't even met yet, I walked out due to the response of one of his front desk gals; and he personally called me and cleared up the matter. A few people posted reviews about her specifically, and truly, to my surprise, she wasn't there anymore. This really shows how much he cares about his patients. I saw him for a few years and then life got busy. I just recently went to the new office after not seeing him in over a year... Wow has his practice grown! And... He still remembers my husband and kids, asked about how things are with them, and STILL works hard at applying individualized care. What a great doc!! I recommend him to family and friends all of the time.<//text>

<Review>Easy to book massage and an adjustment. Dr. Berry is kind with a great sense of humor. He's equipped with new and old techniques to help you or with your back/neck issues. I tell everyone to try him out. He helped me resolve sciatic nerve pain after a few months.
He also specializes in caring for pregnant women!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

I love Dr.Berry he's so good at what he does and he makes sure you're okay, I'm not sure if I went in on a bad day but the lady in the front checking me in didn't seem friendly at all, she wasn't rude but she wasn't welcoming either, other than that Dr is great 👌👌</Review>

<Review>Office staff said they would call me within 3 days to see if my insurance would cover my visit. 2 week later nothing, no call. I dial them up give them my name and the lady proceeds to ask for my insurance info for a second time. Told her never mind I don’t want to wait for another call I will not receive.< /Review>< Pictures>

Core Chiropractic is a wonderful location, with a friendly staff and nuanced team of physicians. I have been receiving treatment for a while now, and can whole-heartedly say that the staff has an innate ability to aid in the treatment of spinal injury or fatigue, more so than most other locations. Along with quality service, they also cooperate with a variety of other medical institutions and practitioners to refer patients to that require additional or more specialized assistance and treatment. I highly recommend Core Chiropractic for any malady of the neck or back.<//Text>

I have been going with Dr Berry since I was 30 weeks pregnant I'm now 35 weeks. Before coming here I had sciatic pain and lower back pain due to pregnancy but it all went away and I still continue to go and feel amazing.  I also get the prenatal massage right after. My insurance covers 100% of my visits so I go every week ;). My baby was breeched at 33 weeks Dr Berry will to some techniques that will help the baby get in position and she did she is now ready!! I was afraid of a C section and hopefully she stays in place.  He is the best. He takes his time with you and makes you feel comfortable. I will recommend him to anyone whether you are pregnant or not.<//Review>

I've been a patient of Dr Berry's for two years now. I've seen him regularly (1-2 x per week) for scar therapy treatment and adjustments. I've seen him in a variety of situations and I've been to other chiros. I can say without a doubt and for many different reasons I don't have time to go into now , he's the best chiropractor I've found in Bakersfield.< /text>

The Service Tech Came On-site And Checked My Pool Plumbing For Leak, He Put Air Pressure In Lines And Inspected The Visible Plumbing. He Claims He Didn’t Find Anything. I Am Not Convinced That There Not A Leak. Still Loose A lot Water. He Claims It’s Evaporation, Wind, Birds Drinking Water. For The 30 - 40 Mins He Was Here Seems Like $395 Just To Pressurize Lines For 10 Mins Was Waste Of Money.<//Text>

<Review>They pretty quickly found the leak, and although I was a little concerned that there may have been more than just the one leak in the suction line to my pool recirculation pump, it is now fixed and the pool is working perfectly. The pool pump is a very expensive unit, and I was afraid that I would burn it up if I didn't find the leak soon. American Leak Detection did a great job!< /Review><Name>Kelly Williams<//Name><Gmap_id>0x80857ea6d6170803:0x3963e9fc879e1d16<//Gmap_id>< Rating>

Thanks to a job done well!!</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

They do thorough work and have great techs. The only issue I had is that appointments are pushed so far out, as if my leak problem is not important or causing a hindrance. I would recommend but would also warn people as well of the wait time.< /text>

<Text>American Leak Detection located a break at the joint of the irrigation system between the PVC  and coper piping under a cement patio! They used gas in the line that escapes the leak and is detected by specialized equipment.

Tanner with American Leak Detection found a leak which had been elusive for literally years.  With his methodical process and application of water at place after place after place, beginning from the bottom and working his way upwards and from side to side he determined the location where the water had been coming in.  He created a waterfall.  I was ecstatic (and with a pail, prepared for the possibility that he would locate the very spot where the water came in).  Ages old mystery and definite annoyance and problem solved!  Thank you, ALD.<//Text>

I called and left 6 messages to call me for a job. They never called. I dont think they have no customer service and just ignore clients. Or future clients. They must be out of business.</Text>

Leak Detection wasn't able to locate my leak or resolve my problem. The two members that came to my house did not wear any face mask or any protection. Therefore I had to wear a mask and gloves. Their office told me that some of the employees were sick. I paid a lot of money without my problem being solved<//Text>

Thank you American Leak Detector

Technician Andrew did an excellent job in finding my house's main pipe leak, which is located in the 200-ft long hill side. He explained to me how he detected the leak in a professional manner, and yet in a layman fashion. He worked diligently and demonstrated his profound knowledge in his field. I highly recommend him.< /text>

They were able to pinpoint a leak in my bathroom wall with amazing precision. They guaranteed within 3 feet of the leak, but were actually able to locate the exact spot. This greatly minimized the amount of tile removal and damage to the wall to access and repair the leak. Highly recommended!<//Review>

Experienced and expert! mHe explained  to me what was the likely
problem after I assured him we had checked the home to find no leaks inside. He showed where the leak appeared  and how turning off  the water turned off the leak, so we could  see that water flow caused the puddle by the front door. He flagged it and a landscape contractor replaced  the irrigation pipe. Good job!!<//text>

Great company.  We've had an underground leak for a few months that caused our water bill to triple.  The gardener wasn't able to find it and we were reluctant to hire a company to find it.  This company found the leak the same day they began the inspection and didn't charge us the full amount they had quoted us.  Very professional company and highly recommended.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Calling American Leak Detection was one of my better decisions.  Getting a water bill and finding out your water usage is off the chart is scary!  Initially had a plumber come out.  He found a leaky handle on an exterior faucet and repaired it and assured me that the problem was solved.  It was clearly not as the meter was still moving.  Scott came out and located the leak in the sprinkler system water supply underground buried about ten inches.  Water was being absorbed with the layer of sand, weed barrier and a tile.  We would have never found it on our own.  Sorry I called the plumber first and wasted my money.  If I ever experience this again, Scott from American Leak Detection is my first call.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80857ea6d6170803:0x3963e9fc879e1d16< /Gmap_id></record>

The worst company I have worked with. I ran behind these people for 2 years. I kept telling them that unless they come when it is really leaking , they can not detect it. Everytime you call, they give you appointment of a week and they come, take the money and not able to detect the leak. They will say when it leaks again call us. When you call again I will come next week.< /text>

I am extremely happy with the service that Scott from American Leak Detection provided in detecting the leak in our house that was due to the leak in the sprinkler system.
He was totally focussed in finding the source of the leak and flagged the spots. The landscaper came validated the leak & changed the sprinkler system and that took care of the issue. The company staff is very courteous and provided efficient service. Scott could not get in the second crawl space and he  promised he would come back with another inspector if there was need. I would highly recommend American Leak Detection company for excellent service,

Technician thought it may be the seal on the toilet, but it is not very likely as I had that replaced some time ago and still have a problem.  It is likely coming from somewhere else but is still not identified.  I had American Leak Detection come as they seemed to have the best reviews. The amount charged without a conclusion is very  unsatisfacory.  The floor needs to be replaced, but where do I tell the contractor the leak is located?< /Review>< rating>

Called to see if I can get someone to detect a leak on a pool. Had to go through two different people on the phone just to get the actual phone number that I had to call for my area. A man answered the phone and was good for the first five seconds until he became rude because I said a little more than what he wanted to hear. He also put me on hold to check their schedule and it was all a waste of time because they had no appointments until next year.

These people don't know how to communicate with potential customers. I am glad I did not have these people over if this is how they treat customers over the phone.< /text>

I am thoroughly satisfied and quite impressed with Andrew and American Leak Detection.  Andrew was a true professional and skilled in his trade.
He knew exactly what to do and found the leak in short order.  I am happy to give A.L.D. two thumbs way up.
Thank you.< /text>

<Date>1574628937811</Date><review>Our experience with the SECOND AMERICAN LEAK TECHNICIAN was "over the top" perfect.  He took a great amount of time trying to detect the source of the leaks in our pool and even discovered one that was new to us.  His patience and focus were very admirable....and we compare it to the former tech who blew out all the former patches making a disastrous mess in the pool as well as all around the decking...and did not clean it up....and the pool continued leaking after his visit!

We give this most recent tech the highest marks for taking on what have been for us very troublesome flaws in our plaster.  We are happy to recommend his work at any time!  And please do thank him personally for us for his diligent work.  He is highly qualified to train others who might do similar projects.

The two technicians who located the actual leak were friendly and efficient but basically destroyed the bottom of our kitchen cabinet.  It turned out the leak wasn't in the cabinet but was in the opposite direction.  Maybe it wasn't possible to determine the exact location of the leak without destroying that panel but it took us a couple of hours to properly realign the doors they removed and push the floor panel back into place.  The leak is fixed so I guess that's all that matters.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Professional, quick and effective (Eastbay)

I had a 200,000 gallon water leak that resulted in an extremely high water bill.  Though I am extremely familiar with my irrigation system and visually checked my property, I could not see any evidence of a huge leak.
When they arrived on site, they did double check that the leak was in the irrigation line and not the line to the house and even checked each valve to make sure there was no stuck valve or problem in the irrigation boxes.  Within the hour they were able of mark the site of the leak using pressurized gas and water combination and marked the location for me. Scott and XXX were very polite and did not mind me asking many questions and following them around.

The report was sent the next day with photos and showing where they located the leak.  I had the spot dig up just this weekend.  Though the leak was visibly undetectable, it is located under driveway pavers approximately 2 feet deep.  The spot they marked was within 4 foot square of the mark. As we dug to 1.5 feet deep turning on the irrigation main allowed the water to spray out and find the leak which was a huge help on an over ½ acre property.

I would recommend them to friends and use the in the future especially if you have an expensive/complicated area to dig up and don’t want to use trial and error.< /review>

I had a wonderful experience with American Leak Detection. The technician who came to my home, Jim, was prompt, professional, and courteous. He found the source of my leak with half an hour. He put a flag where the leak was occurring. When my gardener came to fix the leak, he found it quickly and was able to repair the defective elbow. I highly recommend American Leak Detection.< /Text>

Prompt, courteous, experienced!  I described the problem and their employee went right to work and found the leak in just 20 minutes.  He pinpointed the leak with inches.  The leak was in a main sprinkler line buried 30 inches below grade.  Remarkable!  I would recommend American Leak Detection without hesitation.<//Text>

After checking our water bill, we noticed an abnormal 200 gallons per day increase in our usage. We checked the meter and we confirmed the loss. We had not checked our previous water bills carefully enough, and the leak had been active for about a year. What a loss!

So we called American Leak Detection, a reputable leak detection company, and a technician, SM, arrived at our residence within a few hours.

We have more than an acre of irrigated property in Lafayette, and we were concerned that the detection problem would be a huge challenge given the hundreds of feet of water lines up and down our hills.

Amazingly, the tech, SM, walked outside the house, simply listening for some sounds, and he discovered the leak almost immediately. As an amateur musician, I have very good hearing, but neither I nor my wife could hear a thing. SM simply said, "Here it is!" He modestly said, "I have been doing this for many years." What a relief!

Thank you, SM, and thank you ALD.

Dr. G.C.<//Text>

<Text>Wish I had called them sooner! Super professional, explained everything, found a number of leaks that I didn’t even know about in our vinyl pool liner. Worth every penny for the water saved that was bleeding out slowly before and thanking the chemicals with it. Additionally found a leak in our pump system that was adding air to our system. Not found without reverse pressurizing the system. This service plus a new robot and my pool was finally “right” for the first time in over two years. Thank you!!!</Text>< rate>

I was referred to American Leak Detection by my pool service because we discovered a leak and our EBMUD bill was horrific. They were timely and reliable and they did the work as efficiently as possible. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they didn't sufficiently clean up after themselves. They had to mix concrete as part of the work, and I had quite a bit of clean-up of concrete residue from my deck and surrounding areas afterwards. I feel they could have used more tarps to avoid leaving so much residue. I will know better next time (although, hopefully there won't be a next time!).</review>

<review>I'm am completely dissatisfied with American Leak Detection. If I could give a negative score, I certainly would. The inspection performed at my residence resulted in misidentifying the location of the leak by approximately 12 feet. Rather than use American Leak Detection to perform the repair due to the quote exceeding $850 more than the second highest quote I received, I opted for another licensed contractor to perform the leak in an incorrect location. After busting open my concrete and performing a visual inspection and pressure testing, we learned that all of work done in the location that they specified, turned out to be a wasted effort that cost me financially. When I had American Leak Inspection come back out, the technician brought a more experienced tech who located the leak within 20 minutes which was 12 feet off from tue original. I realize that the agreement states that they are not responsible for financial obligations due to their diagnosis, but when American Leak Detection negligently sent a tech who was clearly not qualified for the job, I felt that they should have stepped up beyond simply refunding my fee. I feel this way because I asked the tech how he came up with his original location and all he could say is, "I thought I heard sounds in that location." Sorry, but when your more experienced tech identifies that he needed to use helium to find the leak and the original tech misses by 12 feet, I as the customer should not own 100% of the financial burden for dealing with the consequences of a gross error. When the owner later calls to leave a Vmail stating that he could do nothing further for me rather than show a willingness to listen to me as the customer, you can see why his staff is on the same level from a customer service perspective. Avoid the Berkeley location if you have a pool leak if at all possible.<//review>< Response>

<review>The technician that came was very professional and was ab;e to confirm that there was a leak, pinpoint where it was and clearly explain what he found out about the cause of the leak.

The only issue I have is why is the cost of detecting the leak ($345) so high.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

{'time': 1470671649999, 'text': "Hi. Thanks for the review and question. We will forward the report to your pool company. There are many reasons air enters the system and shows up at the pump. We confirmed there's no leak on the suction side of your underground plumbing so you can rule that out as a source of the air. Dan suggested a rooter company because a blockage or partial blockage is another potential source of air in the system. Please free to call our office if you have any more questions. Thank You!"}< /Resp>
<user_name>Ed Presten<//user_name><Review>I called American Leak at the suggestion of Coral Pool.  The pool was not losing water but sometimes I was getting air in the filter when the pump was running.  Your Dan Fitts purged the suction pipe that goes to the skimmer & stated every thing looked OK.  He said if there was more blockage I would have to get roto rooter, which I don't understand.  I asked him to communicate with Carlos at Coral Pool who had serviced the pool for the air. Did Dan speak to Carlos? I am very careful to tighten the valve on the top of the filter.  There has not been any air in the system for the last few days.  I hope it stays that way.< /Review>< Time>

We had an appointment at  2 PM and were  on our way to be there on time. Man arrived about 20 minutes early after leaving a message at our home which we were not home to get. Our tenant called us ant told us he was there, we said we were on our way and would be there in 10 minutes. He did service without us being there and had completed his service without us. We were disappointed that we were paying for something and he did not wait for us at time of our appointment ten minutes later.</text>

<Text>Our church called American Leak Detection to assist in locating a leak manifesting in the basement of a 95 year old Julia Morgan building.  While we suspected the leak was on the 2d floor, we needed to pinpoint its location to avoid unnecessary demolition. Our church handyman was unable to determine its location in the basement, the ground or the second floor.  No less than sixteen fixtures could have been the source of the leak.  ADL replicated our process of elimination but even with its infrared equipment, could not pinpoint the leak's exact location.  However, they were able to identify the leak was originating from two of the five fixtures located in the 2d floor parsonage.  After three hours and $600 later, our church was left on its own, still needing to cut holes in walls and ceilings tracing the leak from the point of exposure, up a 6" sewage line, splitting to a 2" pipe and finally to a junction where we found a 11/2" hole.  At least the demolition was minimized but we will have significant wall and ceiling repair remaining once the internal walls dry out.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Working in Sacramento and found this shop. Truly masters of their craft. They make you feel as though you are family. I will be here for a few months this trip and will have my hair cut by no one else. I come back every couple of months and will make sure to frequent this business every time. Love the flat top.<//Review>

By far the best barbershop midtown has to offer. I’ve been to a lot of barber shops in midtown and honestly Capitol barbershop made me feel like family as soon as I walked in. The vibe is friendly and positive. The guys there always have a sports game on to. And they are quick 🤙🏽< /text>

Best barbershop in town hands down not even up for debate honestly never been any place else since that should speak for the quality you receive try it and you'll see the difference they really care about their clients..been going there 10+ years and would rather NOT get a hair cut if I can't get it cut at this great establishment.. the one and only Capitol Barbershop< /text>

Alfonso and his two partners give clean fades, work consistent hours, and are cool to hang around while getting a fresh cut. Alfonso cuts my hair about every three weeks and has been doing so for the last ten years and I do not see anything changing that. If you come in on a Saturday, better show up early or stand in line.</text>

Wow, I'm glad I found this place. I ended up receiving lots of compliments on my haircut. They are professional, friendly, courteous, and the best barbershop. If you need a superb cut look no further. I recommend this place.<//review>

This is an amazing shop! Like one of the other guys who reviewed this place, I started out going to Anthony's barbershop; and while they give good haircuts, the wait is terrible... They were closed today, so I headed down the street and found this place. I can't say enough good things. The atmosphere is friendly, and all the people in the shop are amiable. The haircut they gave me is sharp, clean, and everything I could have gotten at Anthony's, for less money and a lot less time. I'll definitely be coming back.<//Text>

I was in a super rush to get cut,  started at Anthony's barber shop just up the street.. The wait was around 2 hours so I came here, I mentioned to the gentlemen that I'm very picky with my hair and that I keep being failed by these down town barbers lol. Long story short, I told him exactly what I wanted and he did it to a T.. even took the time to explain what he did and spin the chair fully around so I can see every bit. Needless to say, I felt very welcomed (the owners children said bye to everyone in the shop and he and his wife are very polite people.) very pleased because this was my first time coming here. Not going anywhere else from now on and highly recommend this place.< /Review>

I'm a hair stylist from Las Vegas , I came in here to take my newphew to get his haircut. We walked out and I was looking at the back of his head and he had ring worm on the back of his head. One thing in this industry is you have to be clean with sanitizing your hands before and after a client and taking the extra minute to brush out your clippers and spray disfenctned spray directing on the blades or you are going to spread contagious 😷 diseases !  This place is not a place you want to Spend your money ! I give advice to who ever gets there hair done to speak up and ask them personally to clean the clippers and shears before they perform services for you.<//Review>

<review>Walked in after stopping at Aguilar’s for my vehicle’s registration and title transfer. Fermin took my truck in and had the smog done faster than I could finish reading Ephesians. Thanks to these guys, my truck’s good to go for our next few outreaches we’ll be doing in San Quentin this weekend.
LOVE these guys! God bless 💛🙏🏼<//review><gmap_id>0x80d94c1c65bce3a7:0x394114dd161b017e< /gmap_id>< resp>

<Date>1598542493702<//Date><review>Great staff and very helpful! But at times it seems like they are so nonchalant about certain jobs, took my truck to find a problem and it was there for 8hrs+ and when I called they said that my car has been ready and didn’t have a problem with them so they couldn’t find what was wrong... I thought a mechanic does an all around inspection before just giving up, I paid about $100 just for them to not find the problem. I always think of them as my neighborhood mechanics but they can’t even change a battery for me or do small jobs by the sounds of it, everytime I ask there’s a “but”. Great place if you need Air conditioning only though!</review><userid>108095915409354909838< /userid><resp>None< /resp>< Pics>

After a number of mechanics, including Pep Boys and other 'big' shops, couldn't figure out my issue, Tunes Lubes & Smog put in real effort to get my van up and running again. I can't recommend this shop enough, especially if your regular mechanic can't seem to figure out what's wrong with your car. Best of all, they didn't keep throwing costly tests at me - they just did them without upselling me whenever they hit a wall. Pretty sure this shop just became my go-to mechanic, but, with the expertise they're putting into their work, I'll be needing a mechanic a lot less often.<//text>

Neither could offer me a viable solution. Well, Jason did! I was beyond impressed with his service and knowledge!  Also, I had wait at their location and was pleasantly surprised with Netflix of my choice! And, the restroom facilities were amazingly clean, rarely my experience at service shops!!

<text>ALL OTHER REVIEWS ARE FAKE - Don't go here to get your car fixed unless you want to get ripped off. Had a timing belt repaired and they never remounted the engine correctly. Paid additionally for them to fix the motor mounts 3 months later that they should of made sure was right in the first place when they remounted the engine. They told me it was good to go and that my engine wasn't going anywhere. 3 months later the engine is side ways and the motor mounts are broken again. Now they're trying to charge me again for work they should have made sure was right to begin with.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1550602291205, 'text': 'Hello Eric, we are sorry you did not have a good experience 3 years ago.

<review>Rip off, DO NOT GO

I went to Tunes Lubes & Smog in 966 Hollister St. San Diego and they ripped me off over $150. The sensors go for $50 but I didn't investigate before hand.

Second, they tried to sell me an illegal Catalytic Converter Manga Clova brand new (yet it was already opened out of the box) for $1356 which can be bought for $200 online. They also tried to charge me $448 for Gaskets when a full gasket kit for the car would cost less than $120.

Oscar doesn't know what he is talking about and disappeared on the day I was towing my car to a different place when I wanted to challenge him on these prices.

I highly suggest to anyone you do not go there unless you want to be ripped off. Do your research on the price of the parts.

Basically entire cost would have been over $2300 with an illegal part that would not pass Smog. I was able to get it all fixed for about $1000 at the dealer instead.

I am not the only unhappy customer, here is another link outside of here who also got ripped off.

They may have ripped me off for about $150, but you are going to be losing more customers. I hope it was worth it.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

This place is a place that makes bogus diagnostics and tries to rip people of I took it there and they tried to pull almost 2 thousands on a transmission replace but took it a honest friend and was just a sensor, I do not recommend.</review>

Such a Nice Winery with a hotel attached to it. Feels like home but with a view you wish your home had. The property looks even nicer at night with all the lights on....from the garden to the hotel. This is great place for big groups or small. You can grab some lunch in there restaurant. Or grab some small bites and listen to live music indoors. (Outdoors in the summer). They have some decent red's and decent whites. It's seems like they are known for there Sweet wines. Will come back.< /Text>

Beautiful scene, beautiful rooms, wonderful wine. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. The worst attitude from front desk poor tasting experience slow housekeeping. Thumbs down on the bed and breakfast due to the moody staff. Love the wine and will continue to buy. Will not stay again.< /Text>

It was just ok. Servers and management were not so friendly. And they don't serve you. You have to stand at the counter.<//text>

<text>This place wants to charge top dollar for vehicles that need $2000.00 in repairs. Went to look at a black highlander vin no. JTEDK3EH8A2161712.
First off its listed to have around 129k miles on the website. It actually has 136k miles. Salesman told me they do a smog and safety check and proceded to tell me that in this check, their technicians look for oil leaks..... well..... this car had a oil leak coming out of the timing chain cover from the area where the cylinder head mates to the engine block. I am a master certified automotive technician who also has a L1 advanced level diagnostic specialist certification. This repair requires engine removal and teardown to fix. The engine comes out of the bottom of the car with the transmission and takes approximately 17.5 to 20 hours to complete. In addition to this the vehicle was overdue for major service as you can tell the spark plugs were never changed. Other problems. Vehicle had overheated rotors as indicated by the heatspots found on the left front brake rotor. This should have been caught on safety inspection and there is no excuse as far as im concerned here. When I called the salesmen out on his bogus safety inpection, his excuse was they send their vehicles to a smog/lube shop for the alleged safety/oil leak inspection. . Additionally the salesmen told me that he would be happy to have the car fixed but if he did they were going to have to jack the price of the vehicle even higher. I then asked him what would happen if I or my wife would have bought this car and had it inspected by a shop where it was found immediately after buying the car. The salesmen said he would be happy to split the cost of the repair with the consumer if the vehicle was brought to their mechanic for repair. Sorry no thank you im not in the business of buying a car for top dollar only to have to put 1000.00 bucks into it immediately after buying it.What this dealership is doing is not only very unethical but is almost criminal!
Buyer beware they have no remorse here for selling consumers cars with major mechanical problems</text>< GmapID>

{'time': 1611436985124, 'text': 'Thank you for your concerns but to leave this review because you did not get the large discount that you asked for after performing your personal visual inspection is not morally ethical and very dishonest. You pointed out a minor oil leak by looking up into the engine from underneath the vehicle and assumed it is coming out of the "timing chain cover from the area where the cylinder head mates to the engine block" The vehicle has been checked again and it only turned out to be the power steering pump line which sits right behind it that was leaking and has been fixed and verified! Your VISUAL inspection of $2,000 ended up being a $150 FIX! This is a used vehicle with 129k NOT 136k another false\xa0statement, we do not mislead our consumers our\xa0ad is 100% accurate check the photos online, the Carfax Report, and your eyes after your non-credible visual inspection. No used vehicle is perfect but we do our part to make sure these vehicles go through a thorough inspection and any known issues are addressed immediately, a minor leak was either missed or occurred while sitting here on the lot. You came here with an attitude that is not tolerated with only negative things to say about a very clean vehicle in excellent condition to try and get a large discount and you\'re upset that you did not get what you want after driving 3 hours, no need to state false information and leave a dishonest review. You were willing to purchase this vehicle that you\'re complaining about above after pointing out a leak you can\'t see without putting the vehicle on a lift, we kindly mentioned to you that we can have looked at to verify those repairs and go from there. I like the hypothetical question that was answered honestly in your review thank you because if an issue was to happen immediately after a sale we do our best to help in any way\xa0possible whether we pay for all or half we stand behind our vehicles and our process!'}<//response>

I brought a car a couple months ago and I really like Elite Motors for their quality! They even put brand new tires on the used vehicles. This is definitely the place you want to go to if you are looking for a high quality used car. I hope to buy a car  with Elite Motors again in the future. Would recommend this place to my friends and family.</text>

< Review>
Back in February, I was looking in particular for a Dodge Ram 2500 regular cab with the 5.9 L diesel.  The regular cab is hard to find for the most part.  I am in CA, 20 minutes from the Oregon border, so the choices were limited.  I found the exact model (with a camper shell as a bonus) at Elite Motors while searching the Internet.  Called and talked to Matt and he said he would keep it on hold for me while I drove down the next day.

The Elite Motors dealership is very clean and both Matt and Tom were excellent people to work with.  I have a close friend in the car business, so I am familiar with how things work when buying a used car.  I could see a number of quality vehicles on the lot and just wish that the dealership was  not so far away when I go to look for a car for my daughter.

Finally, it has been almost 3 months and 3,000 miles later (one really long trip in the mix) and the truck is just wonderful.  My thanks to Elite Motors for having it on the lot when I really needed to replace my aging work truck.  Thanks again, Matt!< /Review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>What used car company would ever tell you that you were not allowed to test drive a car. And then to argue with you telling you that there's nothing to be found on a test drive, it won't reveal anything anyways. the problem is you either don't have the insurance to cover a vehicle to be test driven or you're hiding something about the vehicle either way steer away from these guys. if you look at the bad reviews they say the same thing they are rude and they wouldn't let you test drive the vehicle</text><username>BadCharBar< /username><pictures>None< /pictures><Time>1585856247507<//Time>< GmapID>

<text>Greg greeted me with a smile, very helpful, n he know his vehicles. Thank you, Greg for your time n patience. Will be back to talk some business. 😁👏👍 Yahoo!!! We met with Matt n we wanted to get the Infinity or the Lexus but unfortunately the bank will not finance an older year, so to make a long story short. Matt told us he will find something close to the Infinity/Lexus n he will call us the next day by noon n he did. Matt crunched some numbers n the bank wanted a newer year so we ended up with a gorgeous Buick LaCrosse CXL. We r very happy owners with our new addition to the family!!! AWESOME MATT N GREG!!! 😁👏</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

If your credit is extremely poor and you want to be locked into a 5 to 7 year loan on a car with over 100,000 mi, this is your place. I wouldn't recommend it. Save your money and buy something a little less used. Everything I saw there had at least 90,000 mi.<//text>

<review>Matt and Tom are 2 great guys to work with.  We just purchased a Super Duty Crew Cab F250 Lariat Ford at Elite Motors.  The entire process was delightful (imagine that working with car dealers being described as delightful!)  From our first phone call to the final delivery of our "new" truck everything went smoothly.  The dealership is clean, respectful and very accommodating.  They were even willing to deliver the truck to our residence approximately 70 miles one way.  Thank you so much for making this a great transaction.    Sam and Dianne</review>< pics>

Tom was great, he ensured that we were taken care of. We were searching and searching at other dealerships. Came to him because he had what my wife was looking for. He definitely went above and beyond compared to my past experiences with other used car dealers, and I buy a lot of used cars. He made sure that the car was ready to go to our expectations. Even after we drove off, the navigation on the car wasnt working and he said no worries, hung up and called me back a few minutes later with a radio shop to go to. They fixed all the hiccups that the navigation was doing (common issue with the car we bought), no cost to us. He made sure that we were completely satisfied.

I will definitely be going to him for a truck when the time comes. Thanks Tom.<//Review>

I really shouldn’t give it any stars.. but my client goes to this lot for the second time (unbeknownst to the salesman) interested in a couple of vehicles.they started talking about options of finance and the salesman started going on an on about if you don’t have a job we can finance in a loud way (the finance question she was asking regarding another possible customer)...he made an assumption that was the only way my client wanted to explore different buying options.  My client was also born into wealth and did not need a job to buy a car; she only wanted this truck to drive on Tuesdays. My client asked can she test drive the vehicle and he said you must “prequalify” to drive it. She said “so the answer is no for a test drive?” He never answered.

My client wanted  to talk about in-house financing as well as cash but the man was so presumptuous about payment;  as well as interrupting the woman she couldn’t finish her sentence. She then asked “what was the criteria for in-house finance on this lot”  he said only cars that were $5000 and below.. but he was very rude; and he mentioned challengeed credit but she did have credit challenges. this question was asked because a friend of hers was also looking for a car, yet she didn’t get to tell him that due to his rude abrupt mannerism. My client and I are well aware of how to purchase a vehicle THIS GUY WAS RUDE, MEAN AND WE NEVER SAW THIS COMING. HE DIDNT WANT TO LISTEN. my client just walked away and went to the Ford dealership across the street (same day) Where she was listened to, test drove and is now a FORD CUSTOMER. Thank you Elite Motors for such a low level of customer service, this lead to better quality at FORD DEALERSHIP.  DONT BUY FROM ELITE MOTORS! This occurred on November 20, 2018.<//review>

<review>Short Review:
EliteMotors = Phenomenal experience - If I could afford to buy cars like I do groceries I would from Tom at Elite. You might as well replace Elite with Tom cause Tom = Elite. so TomMotors916

Detailed
Early December 2016 I caught wind of a heck of a vehicle Tom had on his lot. Now. I live across the country, Vermont to be exact. It’s not typical for me to purchase a vehicle so far away, however living in VT, used vehicles tend to have a thing called RUST! Not only was this vehicle rust free it was exactly what I was looking for. Quite a unique vehicle at a great price. Anyway, I must of called him many of times asking about the vehicle etc, probably drained his phones battery once or twice. He was quick to respond and extremely friendly and personable even running out and taking additional pictures upon my request, even angles that would force one to lay on the pavement. Think about it. He gave a skeptical fella thousands of miles away a good portion of his time, when someone locally could just walk right in and buy it and be done with it in one day

So after getting some low down from Tom, I had one of my friends set up to go be my hands on the wheel, As much as I couldn’t help it, the only day I could make it work on my side was on Christmas Eve.So here we are, about a week out from test drive and Tom was gracious enough to be okay with that plan, even to come to the dealership Christmas Eve and “hold” (so to speak) the vehicle to allow time for my friend to come take a test drive on my behalf

At this point, I imagine Tom was skeptical on the whole situation - being strangers and all and having a friend come down and check it out etc. However he was willing enough to give me the benefit of the doubt and play along. My friend confirmed everything Tom had mentioned so no surprises. Some dealerships deserve the “shady salesman” stereotype this one does not

Now to the purchasing process. I guess it would be hard to buy a car across the country? I don’t know for sure, because the whole thing went quite smoothly. Paperwork seemed like a breeze. Not being there in person obviously extended the purchasing process, with mailing documents to and fro, but nothing like you would imagine. Tom had it all planned out and ready to go - he was on it

So now on to shipping. Tom did offer some options/solutions for shipment however It was in my best interest to source a shipper on my own to keep the additional leg work for a cross country shipment on my side. Shipment did however require additional coordination with Tom, This would be the 2nd time Tom was willing to work with someone other than me… for me (test drive and now shipment) Tom made sure he was available for the shipper upon pick up, to make sure it got loaded on fine and dandy. He even tidied up and stowed some things on and inside the vehicle to increase it’s safely during transit

Arrival, exciting day for me. Tom checked in every now and then during it’s transit to see if it had arrived - I thought that was cool. I could only imagine the outside was sparkling when it left California however, open bay shipments - your vehicle is exposed to the elements. The Interior was absolutely spotless - Tom runs a tight ship. For a 7 y/o vehicle it felt brand new. There were no bad surprises at all upon seeing it in real life to starting and driving it the first time. Mechanically sound etc. Exactly as described even to the last scratch

I know it’s just “Car Buying” but it was really the first time it’s been “Hassle Free” One can imagine the odds of cross country car buying being hassle free are usually
All in all, Tom made me feel as if I were a local friend. He could of probably sold it 10 times during the duration of my “in the air” purchase. It felt as if he wanted to sell it to me as much as I wanted to buy it. The amount of quick response and service I received was incredible and close to indescribable

So when you go to TomMotors916 tell him Jon from Vermont sent ya< /review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMT4UDTRw1YbtjiXu38oFlLfgEyi_dAGiuzF3sf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<user_name>Danielle Thompson<//user_name><Review>I went in 3 different times out to Sacramento to make sure I was getting the right car I wanted. Tom was more than welcoming and made the process easy and exciting. I dealt with rude and pushy sales personnel at 9 other car lots.It was nice to have a good car buying experience. I bought a 2012 camry and I love it. I got a decent price with a full carfax report on it. Car runs great and looks beautiful. I Highly recommend going to elite motors in Sacramento to anyone I know! Ask for Tom you won't be disappointed !</Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Aloha my name is Marie I went in to this dealership to purchase this car. I met Tom the owner he was super busy but still made time to greet me and let me test drive a few vehicle. But I still wanted this car, sad part is I got turn down by a bank I will not say which one. But told don’t worry that car is yours I will do everything I can to get you in this car. And he was true to his word he got us into this car. It was sold as is and I took to work parked it and when I was driving it home all the lights can on. Took it back to Tom he coded it and said no worries we going get to the bottom of this. Long story short more then a few hundreds later my car was fixed and he put 4 brand new tires on my car. Oh I forgot to mention that no money came out of my husband and I pockets. From the bottom of our heart to Tom and his hard working staff. Mahalo nui loa( thank you very much).<//review></record></dataset><record>

Elite Motors, has without a doubt, the worst customer service I have ever experienced at an auto dealer. The vehicle that I went to look at was in terrible shape. It wouldn't even start. The salesman said "none of our vehicles start, that's common on a car lot." After jumping the vehicle it ran somewhat poorly. Inside the vehicle several plastic parts began to fall off as I inspected them. The ashtray was reattached with double-sided tape. I asked about the missing radio antenna and he said he didn't know where it was. I asked if he could get a CD or something so that I could test the sound system. He said "no one uses CDs anymore, nobody has one here." I asked if we could connect my phone to Bluetooth so we can test the sound system. He said go ahead and after about 30 seconds pushed me out of the way and tried to connect it himself. Two minutes later, after failing to set up a Bluetooth connection, he said "I don't know what to tell you." He said if you've heard a stock sound system for a Ford F-150 then you know what this one sounds like. I said I would still like to hear it to make sure it works. He said "I can get static through the radio so you can hear static through the speakers so that proves they work." I asked about the broken grill where the hood release had been repositioned to stick through it, and he said it's a used vehicle and I shouldn't worry about all the cosmetic stuff. I asked about the keys to the toolbox in the bed and he said I don't know about those. I asked about the oil leaking out of the transfer case, he said "that's normal." He was rude, abrupt and confrontational. I asked if the truck had been in any accidents and he said "I don't know, I don't have a Carfax with me." He said "I can show you one after we get the paperwork started." It seems to me, in order to receive only five and one star reviews, that the one-star reviews must be the real ones. They're the only ones with any real detail. Buyer beware. I had $20,000 cash in my pocket, and was ready to buy on the spot. These guys couldn't sell water to a man on fire.<//text>

{'time': 1524793800267, 'text': "First Shannon I would like to begin by saying you were extremely rude and demanding, pushing our salesman around treating him with no respect, it doesn't matter if you had $20k in your pocket that doesn't give you the right to treat anyone the way you did. That being said, you came during the winter in cold weather batteries tend to become weak or completely drain especially not being started and driven daily since the vehicle is on display, which we would've replaced with a new one if you were to have purchase the vehicle. The stereo was aftermarket and worked great, antenna was missing because it was stolen, a simple fix! Sorry we didn't have a CD for you test out but dealing with you slamming the truck doors and huffing around angry was just another pushy way to test us out. The truck you were interested in had an aftermarket huge metal bumper and the truck was lifted, of course whoever owned the truck before had to re-position the latch to open the hood and made a poor decision by cutting a corner out of the grill to accommodate the fitting. The keys for the toolbox in the back were on the keys you were throwing around and there was no oil leaking from transfer case but nice try. We have a Carfax available for free to every customer and 80% of our inventory are One Owner vehicles! I'm glad we didn't sell you a vehicle Shannon it was not a loss to us and I hope you didn't berate and treat the next salesman or any person the way you treated us."}< /Resp>

<Review>nevermind this lame 1 star review from some broke consumer that probably knows not the value of a quality vehicle & dealership - my wife & i purchased a very nice acura a couple weeks ago. excellent below KBB price, car was immaculate, and other cars on the lot were reasonably priced & all were quality well taken care of cars - this dealership does not sell junk!!! very very friendly, great attitude & respectful service. while assisting us & another customer at the same time (running both of our credit & dealing with both of us at the same time ) he (was by himself) tended to both of us customers with respect & decency throughout the whole deal for both of us. free coffee & water & suggested us to step into the very cool better air conditioned room while we waited. to sum this up, i would go back & would recommend any friends & family members there. we visited a good 5 dealerships before arriving here , 3 of the 5 having very rude or overly pushy salesmen which caused us to walk off the lots. nothing wrong at all with ELITE MOTORS & our MDX is awesome for the price we paid.< /Review>< time>

<Review>I was very impressed with my experience taking this class for the fist time to get my CCW. Ted Lidie was a great instructor being down to earth and very knowledgeable. He taught the class and range portion of this course. He was patient and friendly, but serious about what he was teaching . I went back 2 years later to get my renewal. I was able to take an online class and once again, Ted was the instructor. He did another great job accomodating a zoom class due to last years restrictions. Bryan Rheem was the instructor for the range portion of this course. Also an excellent instructor! You can trust NFI and it's instructors to teach you what you need to know for gun handling and preparedness. I was nervous when I went into it both times, but felt prepared and equipped by the end!

Joel is a fantastic teacher. The course is filled with critical and valuable information that every gun owner should know, but particularly those with a CCW. The course is a total of 8 hours, and it was never slow or boring. In fact, Joel has good energy, is highly engaging and interactive and kept our attention throughout the course. I have nothing negative to say. I highly recommend it.<//text>

Had a wonderful day in training at the range and all my expectations were met, as always. Great  information was put out by our instructor and the whole class followed what was being said by him. I felt safe and well informed during the training, to include the live fire exercise.  Ted and his staff were and are always prepared when I attend their courses so I will continue to utilize their services in the future.  [ By Example]<//review>

This place truly deserves a 5 star review. My instructor for class, Ted was by far one of the best instructors I've ever dealt with. He makes sure to understand everything before moving on and if you don't he'll explain it more until you do. You'd think a 8 hour class would be boring right? Not this one! We learned and laughed at the same time and everyone was engaged with what was going on.

My range instructor, Bryan also was as amazing as Ted was. From explaining safety rules at the range to range commands, his communications was clear and simple and he made the Qualification process so simple for everyone. I wanna say thank you for everything and I look forward to joining your advance classes.</Text>

<Review>Chuck is very professional and the information very valuable. The day was productive, yet fun. Chuck is happy to share his expertise and knowledge and readily responded to all and any questions. The individual coaching was great and I felt very comfortable and safe handling the weapons. I look forward to more practice and possibly future classes.
I also appreciated the Insurance presentation and offering. Thank you!

I was very impressed with my experience taking this class for the fist time to get my CCW. Ted Lidie was a great instructor being down to earth and very knowledgeable. He taught the class and range portion of this course. He was patient and friendly, but serious about what he was teaching . I went back 2 years later to get my renewal. I was able to take an online class and once again, Ted was the instructor. He did another great job accomodating a zoom class due to last years restrictions. Bryan Rheem was the instructor for the range portion of this course. Also an excellent instructor! You can trust NFI and it's instructors to teach you what you need to know for gun handling and preparedness. I was nervous when I went into it both times, but felt prepared and equipped by the end!

Ted's depth of knowledge, teaching style, easy-going nature all bring a great mix for learning.  He is extremely thorough, ensuring that he succeeds in passing on the knowledge he has.  He takes to role of trainer seriously and it shows in all his actions.  As a doctor, I have sat in thousands of hours of lectures, and his presentations are at the top of the list of great educators!  I have been a shooter all my life, a Range Safety Officer, and have even had my Federal Firearms License.  As a life long learner as a doctor, and a life long learner of firearms, Ted demonstrates all the characteristics of being a life long learner, and bring a passion to firearms instruction.  I will continue to look to Northern Firearms Instruction for furthering my firearms education.</Review>

<Text>I am a senior citizen and never thought I would ever want to or need to become familiar with using a firearm. I took the class under Candice Norenberg and she made the class so easy to follow and very informative. I left the class feeling confident in the understanding of and even the handling of the firearm. The class is so worth your time and money.< /Text>< date>

Thursday morning CCW renewal class with Mike Moffat at the Redding Gun Club.  Good presentation with emphasis and safety.  I liked the handout with up-to-date info on CA laws.  Qualification firing handled efficiently.  This was my second course with NFI - definitely a quality outfit.  Thanks.< /review>

Mike Moffat is an exceptional instructor.  I took a CCW renewal course from Mike recently, had some fun and learned quite a bit regarding new laws, etc.  Mike is one of those rare gun guys who works just as well with newbies as he does with experienced shooters.  If you get a chance, take one of his classes.  You'll be happy you did!<//review>

< Review>
Mike Moffat did a great job instructing our class. He was very thorough in law and handling fire arms specifically hand guns. Until that day I had never fired a handgun with my opposite hand. Single arm at that and with good guidance. We had a great group of people in our class. Thank you Mike I learned several new things.  Safety , transporting , holding and preparing yourself to fire your handgun. I have always been careful but now it's at a higher level. I really was comfortable and impressed with the class.
Thank you,

Ted Lidie at Northern Firearms Instruction is simply one of the best firearms instructors in Northern California. In fact, had I not just finished the Basic Instructor Training course he taught I would venture to say he is the finest firearms instructor around...

He is thorough and engaging, entertaining while still able to present the course material effectively. He always puts forth a whole effort, there is nothing done halfway. I cannot recommend him enough.<//Review>

BEST IN THE STATE

First of all. Ted and Seth are very personable instructors. Safety first with them.  I enjoyed all aspects of the training and felt much more comfortable with my firearms.  I have been using
NFI for the last 3 of my Renew CCW training and have always come away with more strengths than I came with. Thanks again Guys for a job well done!

<review>I just took my class this past weekend (8/29/2020).  Wow!  What a great experience.  The instructor (Mike R.) was fantastic!  I covered a lot of material and while it was a lot, the way he presented it made it easy to follow and retain.  The qualification part @ the range was so satisfying and reassuring.  I am very comfortable with what I learned and what I will use in my daily CCW life.  Thank you!< /review><pics>None</pics>< date>

I took the two day, 16 hour, CCW class. Chuck was our instructor. He taught the class in a very professional manner and he definitely knew the material he was presenting. He kept the class entertaining, even during some dry legal content. The content was presented well and all questions by the class were fully answered and explained in detail. I got way more out of this class than I expected and learned a lot. I FULLY recommend NFI and Chuck if you need to take any CCW or firearms class. Thank you again NFI and Chuck!<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>The environment was professional and friendly. The class was very well structured, yet flexible according to each student's needs. I felt that the instructors were so confident & prepared  that they covered everything they wanted/needed to cover while allowing students to ask questions freely. Several times they allowed these questions to guide parts of the class; this made it feel like it was our personal customized class and any and all questions were safe to ask.  I learned so much each day that when I walked away I couldn't think of anything else. The format was very engaging, each day went by fast and my focus stayed fixed.
This was an amazing experience, one that will stay with me forever!
I'm extremely thankful for each of our instructors' passion and commitment to teaching legal and safe personal protection.
In the end, I have to say I am most grateful to all who serve(d) to make it possible to live in a country that allows me to decide how I want to (legally) protect myself if I have to.<//Review>< Pics>

Don't get it twisted it was loads of fun. If you are looking for a great place to train and practice. You're on the right track, Northern Firearms Instruction is the place to be.
Thank you Mike, Cindy, Gary, you're the Best.
See you soon.<//Review>

Northern Firearms is a top notch firearms training organization. I have personally been renewing my CCW there every 2 years for the past 10 years and don't even consider another organization. All the instructors are very personable and knowledgeable and not only keep you updated on the changes in the laws but teach techniques of safe and effective gun handling and usage.. while at the same time keeping the classes fun and engaging.< /text>

<Review>Took the CCW 16  hour course with Tom this last weekend.  It was absolutely amazing! I'm no gun expert and chose this path for overall saftey and protection as someone who often walks to her car alone at night.   I was referred the company by a friend and once I read the introduction for the instructor Tom I was sold.  He was very easy to work with and made sure that he addressed all students and their questions.  He was to the point and made sure we understood how much responsibility is involved with a CCW.  I am forever a lifelong student here as long as Tom is teaching.  I can't wait for his next advance class.</Review>< pics>

My parents and myself took our initial ccw class in Burney with Mike and Pickle. Both of these two instructors were fantastic and incredibly knowledgeable. Safety was of their utmost priority when on the line, and the instructional aspect of the class off the line very informative. Mike and Pickle both made the course fun while offering a completely professional experience. I would highly recommend NFI to anyone interested in firearm classes, and I myself will definitely be back to take more classes.< /Review>

Amazing staff and great training. I had quite a few time related hurdles in getting my CCW permit, but Ted and his team helped me every step of the way. I got my training done and my interview was postponed due to COVID. Being a new owner of firearms didn't help either. Had to connect multiple times to get qualified and provide updated documentation. Ted worked patiently with me and get everything squared out. Best learning experience and support from NFI - Highly recommended.< /text>

Mike Moffat is an amazing Instructor.  He is thorough in explaining new laws and how they impact us as well as how to operate our handguns safely at the range.  He is attentive towards all of us when firing our weapon and is ready to assist if we experience any issues.  I would probably not renew if he was not available as my Instructor.  I don’t know how much he is paid, but in my mind he is worth every penny and more.  Thanks for being there Mike !< /review>

<text>I grew up afraid of guns and had no idea how to use them. I decided to take a couple of classes with another gun instructor to learn about them. I was unable to get back in with this instructor so I took a class with Ted at NFI. I was blown away by the training and the skills that Ted taught us. I have now taken multiple classes with NFI and every instructor that I have had has been extremely safe and skilled! I always come away from a class having learned more and improved on my skill! The instructors are amazing, they must have eyes everywhere as they see EVERYTHING, however even if they corrected me it was so respectful and it really ingrained in my memory. You definitely will improve if you go to their class and follow there instruction! I highly recommend NFI!<//text>< resp>

<Review>Excellent instruction, from Northern firearms! Ted Lidie and his staff are superb,  great education about gun safety and on gun laws.
Gary Pickle was my instructor and I was tense and nervous since I hadn't had a lot of trigger time practicing with my gun so my shots were not consistent. I couldn't figure out why I was all over the place, but he showed my that I was not using the right part of my trigger finger, and to pull slower, made all the difference and my confidence soared. He gave us some drills to work on and I feel so much more confident I can handle myself in a difficult situation. Thank you so much Gary !</Review>< Pictures>

<Time>1601909649144<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><text>The class on Saturday with Mike Moffat was informative and enlightening. Having grown up and hunted with a father who, every year, sought after that elusive "big buck" in S. Cal., and, myself, hunted ground squirrels and whatever other target crossed my path, considered myself informed of the current rules and regulations. Of course that was 60+ years ago! Mike interjected enough humor to keep the class involved and, to my surprise, answered questions as they arose. Thank you Mike.

Then, as I approached Sunday, not knowing what to expect, it was refreshing to be with a great group of guys, and gal, instructed by Gary Pickle. Over the past several months it has become obvious that my immediate recall is declining, as is my hearing, and this was proven on the range. However, Gary was very understanding as he had to remind me, many times over, to "take your finger off the trigger", and other such incorrect moves. Since I was unable to hear Gary's instructions, most of the time, with the headset on, I watched the students next to me to see what I was supposed to be doing next. This did not always work. However, not all is in vain, much was learned and retained. Thank you Gary.

I would recommend these instructions to anyone seeking to learn more about handling a firearm and obtaining a CCW.

Thank you NFI.

Mike Moffat, Thank you for another well informed and great instructed class. "keep your finger off the trigger" is now imbedded in my brain.

One of the most enjoyable, and informative classes, and Instrutors, that I have ever had in any discipline. Chuck Fields is a one of a kind, perfect instructor. He made it Fun, Informative and most important, SAFE. I couldn't have asked for or expected anything better than what Chuck and NFI have provided.  Give that man a raise. Thank you Chuck.< /text>

<Name>Jill Cox<//Name><Date>1587252357720< /Date><Rating>5< /Rating><review>I've been battling my own head for over a year as to whether or not I wanted to get a CCW.  I very much want to exercise my 2nd Amendment right and desire to be wise in the protection of my daughter when we're out together, but I also take very seriously the fact that I'm responsible for the final location of every round I load.  Additionally, I was uncertain about my ability to think quickly enough in a tough situation to be sure I would make wise choices for best outcomes.  A friend suggested I go take Mike's class, saying that he was not only an excellent trainer in terms of firearm laws, safety and procedures, but that he trained actual scenarios.  That was the BEST choice I could have made.  Mike is an EXCELLENT instructor!  If you're sitting on the fence, like I was, it's WELL worth your investment to go be a part of the class and let Mike's instruction help you with the best decision for you.<//review>< Pictures>

I took the Handgun Essentials class with Chuck Fields as my instructor. I’m so happy that I decided to take this class. He answers all of your questions and concerns. His expertise on firearms is unbelievable. I went in with very little knowledge and purchased a firearm for home protection last year. I now feel 100% comfortable with my firearm. He goes above and beyond to teach you not only the basics but so much more. I HIGHLY recommend this class to everyone. I now know how to safely operate a firearm. I will definitely be back for the CCW course!<//Review>

The class was good, but there were too many people, the room and range were too warm, and the walls of the classroom are too thin.  It made it difficult to hear Mike and Glen give instruction.  Overall, the instruction and qualification is what I expected.  However, I disagreed with parts regarding what to tell law enforcement in the event of an incident, as well as what force is needed to "stop the threat" for a CCW holding member of the public (MOP).  I doubt anyone in the class besides the instructor Glen had done a felony car stop and engaged someone with a firearm.  A MOP is likely to unload on someone and it is not because they want to "get their gun off," it is because of adrenaline.  I also think it would have been good to advise students to carry a tactical flashlight, an extra magazine, a knife, and a less than lethal alternative.  From a practical and legal standpoint, carrying these things opens up defensive arguments for MOPS involved in the use of lethal/ "enough to stop the threat" force.< /Text>

I have had several renewals with other instructors, but Mike and Chuck made the class interactive, informative, and educational. Although the material covered is indeed deadly serious, the fun and engaging manner of the instructors brought the seriousness of the subject matter home in a very succinct light.< /Review>

I took the Women's Only CCW class. Ted and all the instructors were hands down amazing. I grew up around guns, have shot many guns, but handguns were very new to me and very intimidating. I took the class with only shooting my handgun once before, and left the class with the confidence and understanding of not only how to properly and safely use my firearm, but any firearm I come in contact with. I would highly recommend!</Review>

<Review>Just completed the initial CCW course and the experience couldn’t have been better. 8 hours in class and 4 hours at the range. Ted and Carl Bott are not only a pleasure to chit chat with, they are great instructors They take the time to get your technique correct. My shooting improved in a matter of hours under their guidance. The class size was perfect as well. Next on my list is the advanced and tactical handgun course. This is where it’s at people, don’t waste your time and money anywhere else!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I had a great opportunity to be able to attend basic instructor training, basic pistol, instructor basic pistol, ccw, and ccw instructor course with Northern Firearms Instruction. Instructor Ted Lidie was personable and professional, had a wealth of knowledge and was willing to pass it on to the class and made it a great learning environment for all instructor students and students during my courses. Hands down some of the best classes I have attended in a long time. His staff was great and had there own knowledge and professionalism they each brought to the table. Classes and range time were fun and safe. I would highly recommend Northern Firearms Instruction if you are just trying to refresh your knowledge on firearms or trying to join the firearms industry. The knowledge I received during my courses I will carrying with me and passing along as I continue to be a student and instructor in this industry. Thank you Northern Firearms Instruction for the knowledge and the opportunities that attending theses courses have and will give me. I can not thank Ted Lidie enough for the knowledge and for continuing to have my back since I was one of his student. Forever a student to the industry because of Ted Lidie.</Review>< time>

NFI does an excellent job at making sure its students know the laws surrounding firearms and concealed carry. The qualification at the range is organized, safe and instructional. Me experience with the renewal class made me appreciate that I choose NFI for my very first CCW training. Mike Ramsey is a great instructor and all around good guy. He’s energetic, personable, and passionate about firearm safety. I highly recommend NFI!< /Text>

Ted and his instructors are very passionate about the best and proper instruction for their students in the CCW class. Our instructor Dr. Pickle was thorough, very safe and helpful. If you want the best instructors in the northstate pick NFI!< /review>

I was so nervous to take this CCW class, I didn’t grow up around guns. They weren’t a big part of my life until my husband and I got married. I’ve always been nervous around them. I was encouraged to take the Ladies Only CCW class. I cannot rant and rave enough about this class!! Ted and his team of amazing instructors did an OUTSTANDING job making me feel comfortable handling a firearm and gave me the confidence boost I needed. Thank you Ted and team for being SO fun and SO patient through this process!! I would HIGHLY recommend taking any class through Northern Firearms Instructions!!</review>

Instructors were clearly experienced, thorough, and above all patient.  They worked to teach us everything from physical considerations to ethical considerations.  I felt I came a way from the class well prepared to properly utilize my 2nd Amendment rights.  I never felt belittled but always supported.  Mike & Kevin set the perfect tone.  I will be taking my wife to this class soon too!</review>

<Review>My experience with NFI couldn't have been any better. Chuck Fields lead the class while an instructor in training John Stephenson assisted. The two of them have an extensive background firearms, are highly knowledgable about the laws, are more than qualified, and are two of the nicest - down to earth people i've met. They really put the time in to make this class everything you should expect and more, while sincerely making you feel part of something bigger. Highly Recommend.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Our instructor Desiree made the class very comfortable and was very engaging. She gave us verbal information or directions, modeled it, let us practice what we could in the classroom, and then walked yes through it all step by step at the range. I left the class feeling so much more confident in my abilities should anything happen when I'm alone. I highly recommend this class to anyone who is thinking about purchasing a handgun, regardless if your experience.<//text>< pics>

This was my seventh CCW class in the past twenty years across four states and it was the most informative and professionally taught of all of them.  Mike was great in the classroom and even better on the range. I wouldn’t want to try and get ten shooters, some inexperienced, organized and shooting SAFELY, but Mike makes it look easy.< /Text>

<Text>I’ve been training  with Ted and Mike for years for my CCW renewals. This class was the best class yet. Shooting on the range and getting one on one instruction helped me to be a better shooter as well as a safer shooter.  They took special care with individual attention. Pete also assisted and was very informative. I definitely recommend this CCW course and the instructors to anybody that’s interested in improving their skills and learning the new laws.<//Text>< Rate>

I believe the course was taught we great expertise and in a timely manner. Jeff showed great knowledge and patience in the class room and the range. He did everything in his power to keep us focused, informed, and safe. He took extra time with another student to ensure she was comfortable with her weapon. It showed to me that he really cares about his students and shooting. My gun had a round stuck in the barrel and Jeff quickly got help to get it taken care and get me back shooting. I would recommend this course to anyone.

A special compliments to Ted & Teddie Ogilvie that helped me personally to refine my skills with keen understanding of the mechanics of shooting and perceiving any refinements that could be made for student success.

<review>This was an awesome way to get familiar with gun safety and shooting.
You couldn't ask for a more through and encouraging instructor than Desiree.  She makes you feel totally comfortable and works at your pace when handling a gun. Her enthusiasm about what she does makes you want to learn more in becoming experienced and confident in handling any gun.
Thanks Desiree I am looking forward to taking another class with you.<//review>< pics>

Ted Lidie has assembled are fantastic team and program schedule.
The instruction team have extremely experienced backgrounds and are able to work with all levels of training and all types of people.

All instructors are very safety orientated regarding the handling of firearms and in the educating the participants. Making for a very safe
environment for learning the safety rules that were present during the
class and will be taken home for future use.

A special compliments to Ted & Teddie Ogilvie that helped me personally to refine my skills with keen understanding of the mechanics of shooting and perceiving any refinements that could be made for student success.

Would highly recommend this program and I will turn to them for my
ongoing training needs.<//Text>

The classroom portion was informative…Glenn added his real life experiences and knowledge of the law, so it was easy to apply everything to the real world. The range portion was the highlight, Glenn and Mike’s instructions were clear and detailed, it gave me more confidence using my firearm. They made it clear that safety, responsibility, and attitude are the important factors. I will recommend this training to family and friends. Looking forward to future NFI training!</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The absolute best experience I've ever had regarding firearms instruction. Ted is a class act. Friendly and knowledgeable. If you're the beginner looking for a basic introduction to firearms safety and use or an experienced shooter  looking for tips on how to improve your skill set, NFI is the place to go. Ted has the perfect personality for firearms instruction. He will keep you cool, calm and relaxed and you will leave the range feeling much more confident in your abilities.

UPDATE: I’ve renewed with these guys 3 times now and I can’t say enough positive things about them. Mike and Glen are both excellent, knowledgeable instructors. I won’t go anywhere else.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1591841856354, 'text': 'Seth--aww shucks! Thank you for that review!

I was very pleased with Chief Instructor Ted Lidie and the NFI Instructors.  They are extremely professional and excellent instructors.  I've taken many classes before and I would put Ted and his instructors up against them all in terms of quality, excellence and enjoyment.

NFI is not some fly-by-night company looking to capitalize on our desire to support our 2A rights.  They are interested in helping citizens understand their rights and adequately train them to exercise those rights.

I highly recommend NFI and their instructors for your training needs!<//review>

Glenn Glasgow was extremely knowledgeable and has a strong focus on safety.    The class went along at a good pace with no dead or boring moments.  I enjoyed it so much that I have recommended it to my wife and she will be taking the class later this year.

Thanks again Glenn!

I took the CCW course with several coworkers. The course was informative and I had good time.  They provide a very important service considering the times we live in and the chaos around us. I will recommend NFI in the future for anyone looking to obtain a CCW.<//Text>

Mike,
The class was very professional and full of information.  Your presentation was well done.  The outcome of the class had a lot to do with the leadership.
As I age my hearing isn't quite what it used to be so it would have been nice to be in a class room without the back ground noise of the store.
It was a fun day, thanks.

I had a great time training with Glen.  He is very knowledgeable and very patient with all students whether you are a beginner or an expert. The class material, which covered safety, mechanics of hand guns, situational awareness and firearm laws was very informative and extremely important.  Owning a firearm and especially having you CCW permit is a huge responsibility and Glen really emphasized this point and a result this class has changed my attitude and mind-set in regard to carrying a firearm.

Excellent Class - Highly Recommended!

Glenn Glasgow is an excellent instructor with vast and varied experience in law enforcement and with firearms. He thoroughly covered the very serious topics concerning CCW permit holders responsibilities including legal, practical, logistical and emotional. Many may think carrying a concealed gun is cool, but few think about the emotional and legal issues one must deal with if they are forced to actually use their gun. Glenn did a great job making that perfectly clear for all to reflect upon.

The range portion of the course focused on safety, marksmanship and combat style shooting.  Glenn and Aaron (not sure spelling) were both outstanding instructors.  They conducted the range training with the highest concern for safety, they were patient with all and provided very useful tips to improve shooting skills.

I would highly recommend this class to anyone who has a firearm, even if they are not interested in getting a concealed carry permit.</Text>

This training will be retained, because the instructor (D.S.) engages, communicates, and creates a curiosity  to explore our relationship with firearms. Intense fun, and results in an increased  firearm acquaintance with the relaxed pace of a day hike. Something to discover, just around the corner. You won't doze off during this class.<//Text>

Northern Firearms Instruction is a top notch organization. I was very nervous for the shooting instruction, however, Pete and Carl were amazing instructors, along with Ted and  Mike who were also informative, personable, but most of all professional. I left having not only passed the course, but feeling confident In my knowledge of firearm safety and shooting, and  in the ability to defend myself from imminent harm or death. I do not take this responsibility lighty, and they should be commended for how well this organization is ran. I would recommend this course to anyone.< /text>

Desiree Swift is an excellent instructor...not just lecturing/instructing but making it a hands on experience in the classroom;  no politics, no gung ho stories. At the range Desiree worked individually with each student correcting and fine tuning each persons stance, grip and aim. Take a class from her if possible, she is a knowledgeable professional.< /Review>

NFI is an exceptional program. I attended this last Sunday’s training at the Redding Gun Club and was part of Ted’s group. Ted is absolutely a FANTASTIC top notch trainer. He encourages you he pushes and challenges you to step out of your comfort zone all while keeping safety the main priority. I really appreciated every tip that he offered me.

This was my second time doing my renewal through NFI. I decided to go through NFI again for three reasons:

1. The last time I renewed with NFI Pete was my trainer and he was fantastic.
2. NFI offers Oregon.
3. (Probably the most important of all) NFI sent me an email reminding me that my renewal was coming due and no one else did that. I’ll be back. :)

In researching CCW training facilitators, NFI came up on the high end but I am glad I paid for it. The reviews echo mine and I definitely got what I paid for.

Ted Lidie was an excellent instructor! His passion for firearm education is very obvious. He is a wealth of knowledge and extremely friendly. He interacts very well with the class.  The materials were well thought out and presented and yes, he even made law interesting. Thank you Ted and NFI! I will definitely be back!</Text>

Many may think carrying a concealed gun is cool, but few think about the emotional and legal issues one must deal with if they are forced to actually use their gun. Glenn did a great job making that perfectly clear for all to reflect upon.

The range portion of the course focused on safety, marksmanship and combat style shooting.  Glenn and Aaron (not sure spelling) were both outstanding instructors.  They conducted the range training with the highest concern for safety, they were patient with all and provided very useful tips to improve shooting skills.

I would highly recommend this class to anyone who has a firearm, even if they are not interested in getting a concealed carry permit.< /Text>

<Text>I would highly recommend the FLI 16 hr California CCW Course instructed by Glenn Glasgow.  The home study and classroom time drilled into me that you can never be too safe regarding guns and his handgun fundamentals made me a sharper shooter.  Safety and fundamentals are stressed throughout the course.  Completing this course has made me more confident and gives me greater chance at survival.  I’ll continue to practice mental and physical preparation, and the range drills learned yesterday.  See you in two years for my renewal course!  Thanks, Lance</Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2aNIYWJu9el-UqUOB1GIBLK0osZkTiWj52DMY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x54d2ecba3e3e183f:0x9c02f88e5c3f72df< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have attend so many renewal courses over the decades.  This was the best.  In my training for counterintelligence, and as a police weapons trainer through the State of Illinois, I have not received or experienced better adherence to safety and instruction.  Thank you Mike and Pete.< /text>

Their guns are junk and  the one they supplied me with jammed approx. 50% of the time.   While on the range, you are timed when you shoot, so when your gun jams you hold everyone up and then get barked at by the instructor.  And, the fact that you are not familiar with the gun you are borrowing, makes it all the more difficult to use when you are being timed.

Be sure to bring your own gun along with at least 200 rounds.  Make sure you buy enough ammo a month before you take the classes.  I tried to buy enough ammo a week before classes, only to find out every local dealer was sold out. I then had to use one of Northern Firearms junk guns.

Don't use the foam type disposable earplugs.  They are so effective that you will not hear the instructor's commands while shooting, which will irritate him.  If you remove one so you can hear the range instructor's commands as you shoot, you will be reprimanded for not having both your earplugs in.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

This training will be retained, because the instructor (D.S.) engages, communicates, and creates a curiosity  to explore our relationship with firearms. Intense fun, and results in an increased  firearm acquaintance with the relaxed pace of a day hike. Something to discover, just around the corner. You won't doze off during this class.< /Review>

I just recently completed their Initial CCW course. The course and the instructors was amazing. The classroom portion was extremely informative and well organized. The next day at the range was incredible. You can tell just how passionate the instructors are by the time and attitude in which they gave each student. My shooting increased with some small tips that I had never paid attention to prior. That coupled with the fault indicator target made a world of difference. I look forward, hopefully, to taking more classes with Ted and his staff. Now it’s time to sign my wife up.</Review>

It was an excellent experience - well-organized and executed training by professional firearms instructors.  Ted Lidie is one of the best teachers I have had, which includes academics to the post-graduate level and military training from all four Services.  I hope to attend more courses at NFI.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Northern Firearms Instruction is a top notch organization. I was very nervous for the shooting instruction, however, Pete and Carl were amazing instructors, along with Ted and  Mike who were also informative, personable, but most of all professional. I left having not only passed the course, but feeling confident In my knowledge of firearm safety and shooting, and  in the ability to defend myself from imminent harm or death. I do not take this responsibility lighty, and they should be commended for how well this organization is ran. I would recommend this course to anyone.< /Text>< Pics>

These guys are well informed individuals who will give you a good classroom session with plenty of Q and A time because the class sizes are limited. The range training is geared for beginner to intermediate shooters and offers practical tips for further practice.  The qualification portion was as stress free as they can possible make it.

This was a very professionally run training program.  Ted was an outstanding instructor who knows his subject.  He is able to determine novice from experienced shooters and can focus on what skills they need to focus on.</Text>

< Review>
We highly recommend this top notch training class.  With the excellent instructions from Carl and Mike, we learned how to protect ourselves and other safely when using our firearm.  Their level of professionalism and knowledge put us right at ease as we were both a nervous and anxious on the day of shooting.  We really appreciated Carl and Mike's patients when it came to making sure we were handling our firearms properly and hitting the target.   We did not feel pressured or rushed.  At the end of the day, we both felt confident in our knowledge and abilities. We only have positive words to say about the class, Carl, Mike , Ted and the NFI.  It was a great experience for us.  We highly recommend the NFI and look forward to future courses from them.<//Review>

He is very capable trainer and a great personality to teach a CCW class.  He knows guns and how to train anyone from novice to an advanced shooter.

These men know what they are doing and took the time and attention to detail to make sure we were safe and understood the basics for gun handling and shooting. Withing an hour of hands on instruction, my initial nervousness and fear was overcome with confidence and it ended up being a very fun experience. The instructors are patient and can see what you need to work on. Worth every penny and the time was well spent. Thank you NFI

All inclusive cost is nice. No nickel and dime for add-a-gun or range fees or targets. Recommended highly for the beginner to intermediate shooter.<//Review>

<time>1505700597687< /time><rating>5<//rating><review>What a wonderful experience.  The Women's class was just the right thing for me.  Mike and Ted put us at our ease with just the right mix of levity, anecdotal experiences, common sense and discussion of the laws relevant to the CCW instruction.  They encouraged us to ask questions and made us all feel that our questions were good ones, which prompted really good discussion and reinforced our understanding.  On the gun range Mike and Gary were very clear in their instructions for each exercise and always demonstrated for us what we were to do and why.  They were observant and diligent in making sure we handled our guns in a safe manner and were so very patient and persistent in correcting our grip, stance, sighting and everything about handling and firing our guns. This was a transformative experience for me.  I still have much to learn but I'm no longer afraid of the gun and I know I've found the right Team to guide me in developing my skill and confidence.< /review>< pictures>

Before taking the CCW class on 08/13/2017, I was concerned and a little apprehensive that the CCW class would provide me the basic marksmanship training I wanted and needed.   Well, Mike, you exceeded my every expectation.
Thank you for encouraging me to take your class.  You emphasized the importance of  firearm safety, covered the California laws for firearms in  detail and demonstrated  the correct fundamentals, stance, grip, sight alignment and trigger press.  Mike Ramsey is an outstanding instructor.< /review>

Great course in the instruction of the use and safely of firearms taught by Ted Lidie and would recommend it without reservations. The classwork was well taught and the firing range training was expertly done with experienced instructors with the utmost care given to the use and handling of your handgun. Great experience overall.< /text>

< Review>
Not very honest, I went to the class without knowing what is concealed carry, I just wanted to go to Safety Class to buy a gun for the house. The instructor told me that this class will replace the State Safety class. I stayed for 40 min, and I realized that was not the thing am looking for. After requested a refund nothing happened. They looked at me wired, maybe because I have an accent, I felt discriminated.<//Review>

I went to a ccw class, it was the best learning experience I have had with firearms. The staff is no kidding some of the most down to earth people I have ever worked with. Think about that, the whole staff are experts and can shoot. At no time during my two days with them I felt they were only there to help. A+ . A+!!!!!!!!
Please do yourself the favor of taking a class with them, it will be some of the best money you spent.</Review>

Outstanding course! Mike was incredibly knowledgeable on not only shooting skills, but the current legal climate of California and the rules of carrying as they apply to the various local counties as well. He was helpful on the range for shooters of all skill levels, and the NFI CCW course goes above and beyond your average qualification or renewal class. I would highly recommend them to any new or veteran shooter. Thank you for such a professional yet relaxing experience. My wife and I will undoubtedly be back soon!</text>

<Text>My wife, Bonny, and I choose to take the "live fire range" CCW renewal course instead of just the classroom course. We felt the additional range instruction and shooting critique would be valuable. We were right! The course was well designed and the instructors, Carl Bott and Bob Shaw, were excellent. The course was well organized and we started and finished on time AND we both received some valuable critique of our shooting. Safety was the paramount focus in organizing the morning and all went well. It was a great morning - except for the temperature! Thanks for a great team and a job well done.

I have suffered from PTSD for the past 18 years from being in a mentally and physically abusive relationship with someone who was in law enforcement who used his weapon to put fear in me. So when my husband purchased this gift for me for Christmas, I have to admit, I was pretty upset that he thought this would be a good idea. But to my surprise, by the end of the two day training, my anxiety with firearms was completely gone. My ear to ear smile when leaving the firing range on Sunday told the same story. All the instructors that I encountered at Northern Firearms were top notch. They were patient, understanding, knowledgeable, funny, informative, professional and never made you feel like you didn't belong there. My husband who has been shooting guns most of his life, learned so much as well. This class helped  me take the fear out of firearms and in return gave me knowledge and confidence.   Forever grateful.< /text>< Pictures>

This is my third renewal; second time with NFI and first time with Glenn. I would highly recommend his class as he ensures all participants are safe and dives further into the real life application of drawing and firing unlike any other instructor. Not only does he introduce these two concepts, he also has a course of fire that allows you to practice how you may actually have to use it in a defensive situation. This is the first time I have had an instructor who does more than a class and basic qualification and I appreciate it.

Thank you Glenn,

Mike< /Text>

<review>I have used NFI for a few years now, Ted and his crew are some of the best guys out there in my opinion. Not only do they make everyone feel welcome, being a young guy it's nice to be treated like a normal person from people older than you. I have never felt like I was being talked down to, felt like I was singled out, or felt like I wasn't welcome. Did my renewal course and was really cool to have Ted not only recognize me just from driving up, but all of the guys talked to you like you've known Each other for years. The gun range is extremely fun, you get to do a little "class time", and then get into the live fire training. I have never takin a class where there is multiple trained professionals that are there to help you improve your skills, and answer any and all questions you have. Really like that you can stay after, and ask any questions you have, or address any concerns you may have. Everyone is very laid back, until it comes to safety and quality of training. I have never had a bad experience with anyone while taking this course. Can't thank the entire crew enough for everything you guys do to make training an enjoyable, yet very informative, experience! Can't wait to spend another day at the range with these guys!<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x54d2ecba3e3e183f:0x9c02f88e5c3f72df< /gmap_id></record>

A GREAT renewal class, both in-room and on the range.  Glen is very informative with real life situations and hands-on instruction and with helpful tips for conceal-carry shooting.  A+ recommendation to anyone looking for CCW qualification or renewals (price is right also).  Do not hesitate to sign up with NFI or Glen!!!</Text>

Excellent classroom format and use of laser firing was very helpful. Instructors provided answers and instructions readily. At range, superior basic weapon instruction with emphasis on safety and repetition until students understand all aspects of handling a weapon. No skimping on answers or rushing thru course. Ample breaks.  Ted and Joel readily answers my questions, of which there were many.  Knowledgeable about various counties specific regulations. Recommend anyone interested in learning proper and safe techniques of weapon usage to give NFI a call.< /Review>

I took the 4 hour CCW renewal class. The training was well organized, informative, up-to-date with the current laws, and used real life examples to emphasize safety and practical CCW lessons. I highly recommend this trainer (Mike) and the class. Because of my experience in this class, I plan on taking more training through NFI.<//Text>

<Review>I thought I knew a lot about guns until I took this class.  Classroom was great, Training was exceptional,   The instructors left no stone unturned.  Instructors listened intently, and I received one on one attention. All of my questions were answered.  Instructors mean it when I say you can text or call them with questions.  The day after the class I had some questions because you get a lot of information in two days. Ted Lidie took the time to respond to me quickly, and fully answered  my questions.  It was an honor to be instructed by this exceptional group of guys. I would not hesitate to recommend this class to  anyone .  Five stars! A true 10 out of 10! Thank you NFI,  I will be back in two years for my four hour renewal.< /Review>< Pics>

All of your expertise really showed and your humor made the weekend enjoyable! We had Vint teaching us on the range and he was very knowledgable and patient which really added to my comfort with beginning to use the gun.  He even generously shared his hand warmers with us!

I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of NFI's training for my CCW permit.  Their instructors are very professional and knowledgeable, yet also very approachable, friendly and easy to talk with and understand.  Their emphasis on safety and respect of the handgun was extremely thorough.  I started the day quite nervous, having never handled a handgun before - but ended the day feeling confident, capable and much safer  - for both firing a handgun and also safe storage and handling.  A lot of information is presented and taught, but in a way that makes sense and with explanations of why they do the things they do and what would happen if they were done incorrectly.    An absolutely fantastic class by excellent instructors.  This class removed my fears and turned them into educated respect along with the knowledge and skill to think and react under pressure.  I hope I never need to use those skills, but it feels very nice to know I now possess them and could protect myself if I needed to.  Thank you Ted and Mike for such a great experience. It was a life changer for me.</text>

Glenn Glasgow & NFI did a great job communication prior to the actual class. there was never a question relating to where I needed to be, what I needed to bring and what was expected of me. The NFI training course was very comprehensive, covering all aspects of safe firearm handling, shooting technique, situational awareness and firearm care. Even if CCW is not your intent, the class will certainly enhance confidence. Highly Recommended. Dennis< /review>

< Review>
Every encounter I have with NFI is always top notch, As a range master myself the NFI team really knows their trade. Very knowledgeable staff from self defense to competition style shooting. The NFI team will help you get to your next step and give you that edge you need.  i work with many instructors every day and NFI is by far the best company. The Advanced CCW is a ton of fun. i highly recommend this class to all of my friends, family, and staff. If you are a CCW holder and may be nerves how you will do in a life or death scenario TAKE THIS CLASS! I am an 8 year Vet and been working with firearms most of my life the skills i learned and the bad habits i found out about myself will help me be ready for that day i need it most. "Practice doesn't make perfect " "Perfect practice makes perfect" thank you again Ted, Mike,Pete,Bob,Carl, Mike R., Chuck And Aaron<//Review>

NFI does a great job with their CCW certification class.  My husband and I took the certification class this weekend and not only got our certification but had a great time doing it.  Thank you Ted, Mike and Pete for great classroom instruction and Gary for the range work.  We plan to take more training from NFI and would highly recommend them.< /Review>

I have recently completed my CCW Class and I have nothing but complete satisfaction with NFI. There the best at what they do.
I hope to never have to draw my weapon but if need be I'm confident that with my training I know how to handle the situation.
Thanks Ted and your staff for what you do, your students can now feel a little safer in this crazy world.< /text>

Wow.....what an experience.  This is an amazing group of instructors.  They are personable and go out of their way to make sure each shooter is both safe and effective.  The instructors are very good at making the very dry subject of gun law, into a more interesting topic.   They use current events as examples to teach what is or is not acceptable practice as a CCW carrier. The shooting portion of the class is was very intimidating for me at first, but the instructors really helped me to be more confident and a more accurate shooter while emphasizing safety for all involved. I highly recommend NFI if you are looking to get your CCW or for any other gun related experience.</Review>

< Review>
The experience in training for my CCW permit was outstanding, starting with saying the Pledge of Allegience (it sets the tone). Ted and ALL the instructors were top-notch. There were men and woman of all ages and shooting levels, but no egos. Training was extremely thorough, from our time in the classroom to our day firing on the range. I felt a strong sense of pride, privilege and achievement when I qualified. I will hang my qualification target on my wall along side (or above) my school diplomas, because that's where it belongs. Absolutely the best $150 dollars I have ever spent. I would recommend NFI with Ted and his teaching staff without reservation...in fact, I would recommend every body who is old enough to take the course whether or not you intend to carry. Thanks again to Ted and his great, knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff !!!<//Review>

<review>This class is amazing! Ted, Mike, and Pete are extremely knowledgeable! This was my first time doing the CCW process, and I'm so happy I took this class! They don't make you feel "stupid" if you are a newbie. They welcome you in like family and really teach you all that there is to know.

At the range, Vint was an incredible instructor. He was so patient with our group and really did an awesome job showing us how to properly handle a firearm.

If you are considering getting your CCW, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! They really are the best!</review><GmapID>0x54d2ecba3e3e183f:0x9c02f88e5c3f72df< /GmapID><Time>1483987921829< /Time>< UserId.>

I took my initial  CCW course in Redding and then a renewal course in Redding. I enjoyed them both immensely. I moved to Roseville a few months ago so I had to reapply for my CCW. Of course I went back to  NFI. Not a mistake!  Mike made this class very informative an enjoyable. Hard to believe how quickly the hours flew by. Ted, you have a great company and I’m supposed to say you are the second best trainer I’ve had. I’ll never have any problem sending people your way for training.  Thanks.<//text>

< Review>
My husband and I took their CCW class this last weekend and I will say we learned so much! Pete Ray did the class work and was very thorough and made it a fun yet informative experience!  I know I personally learned a lot!  We had Mike Moffat on the range and he made us feel so at ease, washing away and doubts we (I) had!  Again very thorough with all the safety rules and proper ways to shoot, along with boosting the self confidence and not making us (me) feel like I couldn’t do something! This class was a real joy for us and we will highly recommend it to anyone looking to take it!  We will be taking our refresher courses with NFI in the future!  Thanks for all your hard work guys, you are great!!</Review>

<Text>My girlfriend and I took a CCW class with Mike recently in Rocklin, CA.  Prior to the class, my girlfriend was intimidated and not very confident about passing her firearm qualification, even though we shoot often.  From the get-go, Mike made the class comfortable for her and not intimidating at all.  In fact, she became the nerd of the class who had all the answers when he would ask questions.  I'm glad that she was able to relax in the class portion, and it continued to the shooting range portion of the class.  Mike provided both of us with a lot of good tips and advice.  She passed with 27/30 and left the class feeling great!  We are both glad that we took the class with NRI, and Mike was great!  I plan on taking a holster class with NRI.  You can never have too much education and training!  I highly recommend NRI!!<//Text><name>Roger Cruz</name><Resp>None<//Resp>< user_id>

<pics>None< /pics><Review>I attended the womans only 2 day class with Mike Moffat.  Day 1 of classroom was great.  I learned things that I wouldn't have even thought to ask.  There was nothing we didn't discuss.  Between Mike and Ted every question was answered and welcomed.  Day 2 found us on the range bright and early.  I had been shooting on the range for about 6 weeks,  prior to class at least once a week with my boyfriend, so I had a good foundation.  However I found myself a little nervous before my first shot of course I nosed the gun just a little, missed my desired spot by a thumb, but instead of chastising me for it Mike just nudged my shoulder and said "You know what you did.  ;-) "  The whole day went that way, the staff at Northern Firearms is helpful, highly knowledgeable, supportive, very reassuring and above all safety oriented.  I would recommend them hands down!! <3  I'm looking forward to taking the advanced course!!<//Review>< name>

Update: We just did our Renewal on Thursday February 27th and again we had a wonderful time. Ted Lidie, Mike Moffat and Dr. Pickles are the best and I thank you all for everything you do. You have taught me so much. Hope to see you all at the range!

My husband and I just completed the course this last weekend and I have got to say this. Each and everyone of the instructors that worked with our classes were excellent. First off the class at Sportsman's Warehouse was taught by Pete Ray and Bob Shaw and I learned more about guns than I ever knew plus they made the class very fun so I thank them for that. We then had the law part taught at Oxford Suites by Mike Moffat and Ted Lidie and again the class was very informative and enjoyable. A big thank you to Mike Moffat who is like a brother to me...it was great having you as one of my instructor's along with Ted Lidie... you both made the class so enjoyable. When you are trying to learn things like what the laws are for this or for that it's nice to have it at least made fun enough to want to be there and learn.
Then on Sunday we went to the range. My husband and I were on range 1 with Ted Ogilvie and Larry Mullins. Ted Ogilvie was on our end and he is a fabulous instructor and from what I did see and hear about Larry Mullins he is just as awesome. They made sure that each and everyone of us learned everything we needed to know to pass the course. So THANK YOU TO YOU ALL...We couldn't have done it without you. I also want to thank StandsRUs for donating the target stand for the raffle. My husband was the lucky winner.
So we will be watching for you all out at the range as soon as we become members.< /review>

<review>The instruction was informative, engaging, friendly, fun & comfortable, even for the harsh weather we had. The class felt like a weekend with 40+ like-minded friends. I highly recommend this class to anyone looking to get their CCW or to learn the basics of having a firearm for the purposes of home defense.   I wish to thank Ted Lidie & his crew at N.F.I for a fantastic experience.</review>< Name>

HANDS DOWN THE BEST CCW TRAINING AROUND! This whole entire group of instructors are AMAZING!  They have a so much knowledge and make learning FUN! They make sure you feel comfortable handling gun and if you aren't at the start of the training, by the end you will be! Words don't give the experience justice! Thanks again NFI Team for a great weekend and the confidence!!! #presspresspress 😉

Northern Firearms Instruction is a first-rate program! I used instructor Mike Ramsey who was 2nd to none and well-educated, fun and quite helpful. The instruction covered legal requirements of CCW holders and the instructor shared several stories to help reinforce the lessons learned.< /Review>

< Review>
For this past Mother's Day my husband bought me a gun, we both thought it would be a good idea to do a CCW class. A few days later one of our friends mentioned he was setting up a group who also wanted to either get their initial CCW or get a refresher course.
We were both super excited, however I was a little nervous. I had been to an indoor range a number of times but have never actually loaded my own gun; I had always gone with friends who would do that and hand it over for me to try to shoot the target.
After the first 2 nights of class I felt so much better about handling, transporting, and maintaining my gun and I hadn't even shot it yet! Ted and Mike did such a wonderful job at keeping the class entertaining and explaining things so that everyone could understand; whether you were a beginner like myself or an advanced shooter.
When we got to the range I was so nervous. I was going to shoot my gun. I was so impressed by how Ted and Mike seemed to make that all go away. They did such a fantastic job at giving each and every individual the help they needed. I have a "harder" time taking direction however I never once felt like either Ted or Mike were annoyed by consistently helping or answering any questions I had. Throughout our time at the range I felt my confidence in my ability to handle my gun grow. It is such a cool feeling.
I plan to continue practicing shooting and the maneuvers we were taught by NFI; maybe one day it will save my life.< /Review>

Training with the NFI team was a great experience. The classroom and range training were top notch. I am not a very experienced shooter and Glenn promised me, that with his help, I would pass the certification. And he was right! He taught me correct stance, how to line up the weapon properly, even how to breath.

I would highly recommend NFI to anyone who is looking to obtain their CCW.</text>

Mike Ramsey was awesome,  very thorough and yet easy to understand.  Clear and concise.  Sense of humor.  His teaching of the proper grip immensely improved my comfort and accuracy.  Good sense of humor
I will strongly recomend him to anyone i know is pursuing the ccw or just wants to improve.  Stephen medowar, a neighbor,  recomemded him to me and i am gratefull for that referral</review>

<Pics>None</Pics><name>Dylan Tuxhorn</name><review>NFI is an awesome group of instructors. Even if California didn't require periodic recertification, I'd gladly take the courses they offer for the helpful tips from the friendly and knowledgeable staff. Not only are the lessons and drills fantastic but the trainers make safety an absolute priority.
The classes I've been in have had a great atmosphere and everyone there, from first timers to seasoned shooters, seemed to have a blast. Plus off the range there was coffee, doughnuts and cool saxophone solos courtesy of Steve Gregory in George Michael's 1984 hit, "Careless Whisper." It's really the little things that make a class.
Jokes aside, they're a great group of guys. My friends, family and myself will definitely continue using them as our go-to training company. I really can't recommend them enough.< /review><user_id>116082614814766506018< /user_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>The best CCW course in Northern California, bar none. Informative, engaging information with a focus of defensive actions and thinking over simple target practice. A top notch team with a vast wealth of knowledge and experience between them. I will always recommend Northern Firearms Instruction for anyone interested in getting their CCW or renewing, and after taking this class, I look forward to taking the advanced levels as well, knowing that the skills I learn will all be applicable to protecting myself and my family.< /review></record>

I can't say enough good for NFI and our instructor Glenn Glasgow. He made the renew process very interesting with great examples of CCW situations. He even found time to show me a thing or two about my own weapon.

All I can say is there are great instructors with NFI and I will use them again and refer them to my friends, of which I have already done.

Thanks, NFI< /review>

The best and most professional firearm and CCW certification bar none. From classroom to field training the finest most easy to understand and learn from instruction there is. Wife and I both took the class and highly recommend Northern Firearms Instruction for everyone wanting to get their CCW permit and to learn every aspect of the responsibility in acquiring a CCW permit and to safely and correctly handle a firearm.<//text>

<review>Glenn was great during our 16 ccw class. It's a long 8 our class on Saturday but it was well worth it. Great information and it's is very interactive. Glenn answered all of our questions and and was a very professional instructor. Range day was awsome. Great instruction and safety. He took extra time with a few shooter who had a little trouble with a few things. All in all NFI is a great company to get your ccw training and Glenn was a great instructor looking forward to working with him in other classes!!</review></record>

Awesome experience!  All of the instructors were highly trained and very professional.  These classes fill quickly and sure enough, the class was full when my husband and I went to sign up.  Ted Lidie was kind enough to let me know as soon as someone dropped out so we could fill their spot.  Ted Lidie and Mike Moffat did a fabulous job teaching and answering all of our questions.  Pete was my instructor on the range and made me feel extremely comfortable in every setting.  Made sure everyone was ready before we moved onto the next training.  Safety is key with this company.  Would highly recommend NFI for any firearm training!<//text>

I had a great time and learned a lot in Glenn's class this weekend. Glenn keeps the class interesting with his stories in law enforcement and his knowledge of  firearms. I will definitely recommend his class to any of my friends that are looking to get there CCW . I am looking forward to taking some more training classes in the near future with Glenn and NFI. Again, thanks for all the support Glenn.

I attended an excellent CCW renewal class on the range at the redding gun club over the weekend.  The whole NFI staff, including my trainers Mike Moffitt and Ted Lidie, did an outstanding job with the group.  I even got to put my recently acquired skills learned at NFI's NRA certified range safety officer class, to work helping another student get familiarized with the use and operation of an unfamiliar handgun so she could qualify.  Taking your renewal class on the range is the best way to go as you learn the required elements and legalities as well as brushing up on your shooting skills in a personal protection driven class.  I highly recommend using NFI the next time you have to renew!<//review>

We are looking forward to attending the advanced CCW class in the future. If you have any doubts about your training through other classes this is the one to take to set your mind at ease.

<Text>What an awesome course! The instructors take the time to make sure everyone is up to speed and understands the information before moving on. There's plenty of time for questions and answers and they never make you feel like it's a dumb question.

Ted keeps in great communications with students before, during and after the course. His emails are concise and complete which I really appreciated. If you're unprepared- it's on you because he's very upfront about needs and expectations. I started out in Hunters Safety with Ted L so it was a no brainer to attend his CCW course.

I took this course with a couple of my family members and we were all at different experience levels but the instructors tailor the class for everyone. Range day was the most fun any of us have had shooting our guns. They even put us on the same range together which was just a nice touch.

I'd like to thank Carl and Ted L for their instruction on the legal aspects, to Joel K for making the hands on laser practice fun and informative and to Ted O. For his patience and attention to detail. All the instructors WANT you to succeed and it's evident. Like I said they take the time and make sure everyone understands. Even though the course is over- the guys make themselves available any time from here on out if anything comes up or you have any questions.

We haven't stopped talking about the experience. It was great. When Ted says his team is the best, it's true and they take pride in that. We hope to continue our education with NFI in the future! The advanced CCW looks like a lot of fun. Thank you to everyone at NFI!!< /Text><Response>None<//Response>< user_id>

< Review>
To Everyone at NFI...  Thank you for putting together such a wonderfully informative and entertaining class.  I attend the ladies CCW class in December.  I learned about not only gun safety and laws, but about personal safety as well. I love how light hearted and amiable all of the instructors were on both days.  It shows that you really care and are passionate about your message and what you are trying to teach.  It is very genuine.  I really enjoyed Sunday, being able to shoot at the targets.  My only suggestion would be for those of us who do not own a gun (which I am guessing is a minority).  I know that you had several guns for us to hold on Saturday, but I was wondering if you could bring those again for us to see on Sunday as a refresher before we shoot; then perhaps we could choose the one that fits the best.  The gun I was assigned to kept locking up/jamming which was kind of annoying at first, but then it did make me feel more comfortable to not get nervous when a problem happens.  It was a 22 something and it was fun to shoot when it wanted to!  But because of the size, I wasn't sure how well I could conceal that particular gun on myself.  When I get my own gun and get more comfortable with it, I definately want to take the advanced course.  I have highly recommended your basic course to all of my friends.  Thank you again for teaching such a great course and for instilling confidence in myself to be able to protect my family.< /Review>

I went to the NFI's CCW renewal class with Glenn Glasgow.  The class was from 5 pm to 9 pm and to quite honest, I was a little worried that I would poop out before the class was over.  Glenn's knowledge and ability to instruct the class in such an interesting way held my attention and the time flew by.  I went away with more knowledge, information and things to think about and plan for in different scenarios than my 1st CCW class.  I highly recommend NFI to anyone interested in a 1st time CCW or renewal.  I am extremely happy with the class and am sure you will be too.  I will go back to them for my next renewal.<//text>

<Review>I had Glenn for my sac county CCW class. He was great, attitude, class pace, and tips where I needed improvement! There were a couple new techniques that I'll definitely be training on to get my muscle memory and speed improved.

I've met a couple of the instructors/trainers from this company and they have all been very friendly, respectful, and very giving of Thier knowledge even when I wasn't in their class. When my wife is ready she'll be going through NFI for her CCW class.

Thanks NFI!!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

My first impression is being greeted by instructors that are warm and friendly and might I say dressed very professional. The information that I learned this weekend was incredible . Questions were all answered and you never felt awkward or dumb asking. We laughed learned and made new friendships . The instructors today were hands down the very best we could ever ask for. Thank you so much for your patience and understanding with us all. I know I personally left the range today feeling confident and excited about my decision to become a CCW holder. Ted thank you again to you and all your instructors ... Top notch.

I recently completed the CCW Permit Course with Northern Firearms Instruction.  I can honestly say they exceeded all of my expectations.  Ted Lidie and his staff were professional, interesting (never a dull moment in the instruction), and safety focused during the entire course.  I had to change some of my habits regarding operating a pistol, but the result was increased accuracy and speed.  The course was 12-hours in length, but I will be thinking about the topics covered for a long time.  I plan to be a repeat customer.  My hat is off to the people at NFI for their hard work!  Thanks!</review>

<review>This course through NFI was incredible! Mike did such a great job at teaching all the laws of having a CCW and answering any question we asked, as well as the training on the range. I am no expert at shooting handguns, but I have been shooting them for a long time and was pretty good with them. But with the little things Mike taught me, it totally changed the way I shoot a handgun for the better. I am 100% confident with my ability to be a defensive shooter thanks to Mike and this NFI course. If anyone were to ask me where to go for a training course, I will tell them NFI hands down!</review><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

I have been raised around firearms and have hunted since I received a Red Rider for Christmas at 5 or 6 years old. I was pretty amazed at how much I learned in one day at the range with Ted Lidie and Mike Moffat. I watched a female first time shooter(ever...any weapon), perform and even outperform many seasond shooters, with a borrowed gun. Great instruction with a huge emphasis on safety! Criminals beware of anyone who has received thier CCW through NFI. Thanks guys!<//review>

I was a student in the Hunters' Safety Course hosted by Ted Lidie at Sportsmans' Warehouse in Redding. To start out with in the class Ted asked us all of our names and memorized them. He continued to call each of us by name throughout the duration of the class. I thought this was a great personal touch that made everyone more comfortable in the classroom.  Ted was great at helping out the younger kids without giving away free answers to them. He answered all the questions they had and never once belittled or talked down to them unlike other firearms instrcutors I have had in the past. I sure hope that he is still teaching when my kids are ready to start hunting. As for the course material, I learned a ton and built a solid foundation to pass the test. I passed with a 97%.  I feel that Ted is the perfect person to introduce someone into hunting simply because he is so passionate about it and wants everyone to have a good, safe time. Thank you for your service Ted and God Bless!< /text>

<Text>My husband and I took the course together. I have to say that it was an mind blowing class!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My husband has  had weapons since he was very young and he even learned a few Ted and his staff
Mike and Bob were very helpful!!!  You just never know what you might learn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The     History Lesson was AMAZNG!!!   We would recommend NFI to everyone who wants to handle weapons!   I think I'll do some semi-private lessons later on, too.  We did the CCW class.
So helpful, sooooo knowledgable.  Really worth the cost!!< /Text>< rate>

<text>So, I hate writing reviews, because honestly, i feel it as the same at voting my 1 review does not make a difference. but as for Ted, I want to write a review!

I am not surprised he has 5 stars he is awesome. On wednesday I received my ccw request for a class. I liked guns fishing and other stuff so decided to give Ted a call, off the bat he gave me the info i needed. cool I will go there.

I went there yesterday in the class, and honestly i was kind of nervous, wondering what is this class going to entail? i wasn't good at school will i learn much? what if i fail? what if today i cant shoot? Ted came in the class and he came up and started talking.

Amazingly, how he explained everything I understood everything I needed to and more. such as, if what positions would it be acceptable to use a firearm. either way to get to the point his references did not make it feel like a class, it felt as if you were learning from a professional friend. We all have that friend that tells us laws and then you find out they were wrong.... This wasn't the case, Ted knows his stuff.

I went to the range the day before shooting straight, last couple weeks before shooting straight, no problems. I have no idea why but yesterday I could not shoot for the life of me... don't know why, but Ted didnt yell, he didnt even look at me like "geeze this guy sucks" he told me what I was doing and told me to keep trying.

Eventually i got back in my groove, didnt shoot as good as i normally, but better than i started. The whole time he made me feel comfortable. Whether i shot good or bad i felt good.

This is probably the longest review I ever wrote, but point being Ted is awesome. I hope other people get to experience what I did yesterday. I cant say how other instructors are, but I know I probably wont, because I will probably look for any more classes Ted has in the area if I take another class of anything. I plan on purchasing a smaller barrel gun and look forward to seeing Ted to take another class.

Hope this helped at least 1 person.
