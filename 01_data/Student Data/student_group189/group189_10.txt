I like this place.  I got there ~2pm, and I decided to do the AYCE Sushi.  I just finished work, and I was starving.  I ordered three rolls - crazy California roll, samurai roll, and tiger roll.  They were huge!  Huge not with the rice but with the filling and topping.  They were closing at 3pm but I didn’t feel rushed.  They even came around to all the tables to make sure people place their final orders.  A couple came at ~2:50, and they were not turned away.  They were told they were closing at 3pm but could stay if they place all their orders.  They stayed.<//text>

<Review>This is my third time coming to Masu and absolutely enjoy their lunch special of All You Can Eat sushi. You saw that right: ALL YOU CAN EAT SUSHI. It's $15.95 per person. For the first round, you order two items. Then, you can order one item for the following rounds. So if you go with one more person, both of you order a total of 4 items and then a total of two thereafter. You can never go wrong with this restaurant and are definitely getting your money's worth because it's $15.95.

I went to Masu on 3/12/17, where my boyfriend and I ate 8 different types of sushi rolls. The total was about $30.

Service is also attentive, which is a plus in my book. Additionally, they're very polite and accommodating to large groups.

Parking around 3rd Ave is frustrating, but there are parking garages. Parking on weekends is free.

Try this place out if you want to experience AYCE sushi. I guarantee you won't regret it.< /Review>< Name>

50% off all rolls but when you go into the restaurant the menu doesn't tell you how much each roll cost. The workers aren't sure either. Next to the list of rolls is a deal for all you can eat for $15.99. they try to sell that to you. Honestly it's a pretty good deal. I don't regret it.< /Text>

This place is the best sushi for the price in San Mateo! Not the best sushi in San Mateo but for the price it can’t be beat. They have a wide selection of rolls and all have great flavor.< /Review>

Best dining experience I've had. We ordered the pay per person menu and every dish was extraordinarily prepared and provided us with a glorious tasting range. So impressed, waitresses were wonderful. A little pricey but definitely worth it.</review>

<review>There's a reason it's all you can eat for 15.95, it's pretty bland. Almost all the rolls I ate hardly had any flavor and the spicy fish one made my husband throw up right before leaving in the restaurant. Plus the portions you get for the price aren't that good. Maybe it was just a bad day but I'd rather pay 30$ for all you can eat sushi and get what I pay for. The customer service was good though so I'm sad the food wasn't very good.</review>< pics>

Absolutely terrible quality. Our "sushi" had overcooked rice and the pieces were falling apart. We had multiple rolls that didn't even have any fish in them. I didn't expect much for the price, but they managed to be worse than grocery store sushi. With so many other options around, I'm not sure why anyone would come here.< /Text>

Super nice servers, really accommodating. Big place with tons of seating, a bunch of lunch specials, bento boxes, nigiri, sashimi, etc. Unfortunately their sushi chefs aren't that great and their quality can't match their service.

Wins the award for the worst Dynamite Roll in San Mateo, hands down. As long as you stuck to their fresh fish menu you'll be okay, but stray from that and you're in for a far less than stellar meal.</text>

Tried their all you can eat lunch ($16.95) but it was really bad even for ayce standards. One item was ok (spider roll) but anything from the raw fish roll menu and the cooked (teriyaki, katsu) menu were almost inedible. I’m pretty sure they use their deep frying oil over multiple days by the taste of their tempura and chicken katsu. We immediately ordered cooked items after trying their hamachi and tuna rolls but the chicken teriyaki was overcooked to an extent that it felt like chicken jerky.<//text>

All you can eat sushi for lunch for $16! Great for the price but not much in terms of variety. All rolls, no nigiri or sashimi for the price. Most of the rolls are a variation of California roll, tempura roll, etc. They do have non-sushi items included: udon soup, vegetable tempura, chicken teriyaki and chicken katsu. You're able to order 2 dishes per person initially and 1 dish per person thereafter. Service is good.</review>

<time>1614631523766<//time><rate>5< /rate><Text>When I was homeless for a few nights last month, I hung out in the underground area on 7th and Hope right in front of the Dunkin Donuts since it provided shelter once the trains stopped running from like midnight to 3~4am. During the day I'd ride the subways and buses (free WiFi on the buses, by the way) since I had nowhere else to go during the pandemic. This is a great transit hub since you can take the subway to Santa Monica or North Hollywood or even Long Beach (haven't taken the Long Beach subway yet). The few days of homelessness I experienced really helped me get acquainted with how easy and convenient it is to take public transit in Los Angeles. As a native Angeleno, I'm hoping to utilize the transit system more under different circumstances since it was way more convenient than doing the whole car thing (yikes!).</Text>< pictures>

Not enough ventilation, many times overcrowded. Not enough security at times. Smells bad. No parking at most stations.

<Review>Great location, convenient, a lot to promise.
The station will serve the blue line, expo line and red line. From here you can go to Union station, and pretty much anywhere else.
It is safe, although unfortunately it is not guarded properly for issues other than security. Many people won't pay for their fare, some will pee in the elevators and at the entrance. A lot of trash near the stairs and entrance as well.
We all hope that as the city progresses, more attention will be paid to this station.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPlIhi4GOEP2Y-__I_bTQzFfyFCtDUTye0I9aGv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdyZUUDGmDtYqtRvpXhWkvJwtgKRiv95ywkRie=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPyrXWFyv-I-HocnzD54KOr6M06XbKagq8lowF6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< time>

All the trains run on time except the light blue expo line. It is never on time. If you plan to use the expo line make sure you leave your house with enough time to spend waiting for trains that never show up as scheduled.</Text>

Metro hub. All LA metro lines connect here at 7th street. The transferring from 1 line to another can be confusing as some lines share platforms. However there are plenty of maps to help. Keep in mind the color name for the line you require followed by the destination.
When transferring to the blue line. Look out for the large banners at the top of the staircase. These banners indicate if the train is heading towards Santa Monica or Long Beach.</Review>

This station has all metro trains to different stations. Red line and expo are the main ones. Now there is construction going on and if you haven't been to this Station before there may be some confusion. Please follow the directions given to get to your train. This metro is not that clean but compared to some other stations this is better. Bus that goes to Disney Park stops just outside this station. Also places like Staples Center, LA Live and Microsoft Theater are just 15 minutes walk from this station.</Review>

I took the Expo many times back and forth to Santa Monica and what a nice treat!  Clean safe and man I just relaxed on the train for 40 minutes knowing the car traffic was at least a 3 hour drive.  No stress and I met nice folks on the train.  You can't beat $1.75 on the Tap card each way to avoid all the pain and cost of LA traffic.</text>

<Text>So much easier time and financial efficiency (gas & parking) taking metro to downtown LA!! Everytime is a nightmare driving on the freeway where Fwy 5, 10, 101 & 110 meet..... :(

At this station, I see many more white collar. I am glad people working in downtown really make use the metro system. Instead of fighting in the traffic, why not relax on the train.</Text><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

Has a lot of potential, but largely overrun by smelly homeless and mentally ill, esp at night.  Trains after 8pm seem to have no schedule consistency, even though there is track maintenance (every 20 minutes). However, due to my downtown job, and an aversion to driving the overcrowded freeways, it is convenient mostly and the Mta staff do try and keep things running efficiently.< /review>

<review>Great transportation hub. From this point you can catch the red, purple, blue and light blue line (Santa Monica). Go upstairs and grab the foothill silver streak or metro silver line. As well as many local and municipal connector lines. If it's in away you want to go you can reach it from here..... Not your knowledge of the transit system will hold you back.<//review><name>L.A.

Don't ask any staff member anything. They told me to solve my own problem while calling me a Mexican wetback and he couldn't wait until we all got deported. Security is a joke they'll check your tap unless you're homeless. Why even bother hiring anyone if all they do is stand around and do nothing. Just buy a mannequin its cheaper and they'd have better personalities.<//review>

7th&Metro could be a great place.  There are a lot of places to eat nearby, you have access to the Red, Purple, Blue, and Expo lines.  There are shops  to go to.  It could be a great place if the city would focus on getting rid of the crime near the entrances to the subway.  At times the Hope St. entrance can resemble a little skid row with people passed out on the sides on the entryway and others trying to sell or smoke methamphetamine.  Metro, please do something about this.< /Review>

7th/Metro Center has traffic congestion above grade and this is intersection shares a network of lines throughout the city. Expo, Blue, Red, Purple and Sliver Lines (Street Level) meet here. Any casual or occasional Metro passenger could travel to either Long Beach, Santa Monica, North Hollywood, Union Station, or Koreatown from this point of reference. It's not that complicated to get a general idea of where to travel. Nonetheless, for future reference, it's helpful to know major stations, streets, and local bus routes to clarify an exact location, as you get more experience. There's a lot of passengers from different walks of life. Usually, most people are on their smartphones and helpful if you're lost, alongside with security. Generally speaking, you should be safe and not have any issues. However, with most new habits, one could easily adjust and built familiarity.</review>

Increased security over the holidays. We'll see how long it last come January 2nd. Where the rich and homeless can take the train together. Easy enough to figure out how to get around. Staff is helpful, usually near invisible security.</Review>

Central downtown hub for the main metro lines. Spacious enough to cope with the crowds but badly designed for the flow of people and awfully outdated and gloomy. Elevators and escalators are always broken. Desperately in need of refreshing.

Pretty impressive how they keep on top of turning around expo line trains every 6 minutes interspersed with blue line trains though. Good job, train operators.< /review>

Urine smell 24/7. If you're disabled and the escalator is broken (again), you're screwed! No signs to indicate: exit this side for these bus routes, exit that side for those bus routes. Non-existent signage sucks for transferring subway to rail: if you go up the last staircase, easy to board blue/expo line; if you go up middle staircase, you're on the wrong sidex: you have to take stairs / pee-smelling elevator to go OVER the tracks to get to the blue/expo boarding side.<//text>

<Text>Hey its the Metro. What do you expect? I find it much better than driving my car and trying to find a place to park DTLA. Just a note: If you are going to complain about urine smell on the elevators then do like the rest of us and walk up the flight of stairs.< /Text>< Name>

People here are very rude:

•Some guy spit on me from the upper level
•Someone specifically told me to get off my phone, but not everyone else who was also on their phone

It really hurt my feelings. I advise you to never come here.< /Text>

Convenient metro station near where we live.

Occasional smell of piss at the entrance.

Not handicap friendly when you want to enter through 7th street. But there's an escalator up when you exit.

Make sure to bring hand sanitizer.<//text>

LA TRAVEL CHEAT SHEET

To get between union station and 7th street, take either red or purple lines, (they don’t matter)

Blue (A) or expo (E) line will get you to staples center (also doesn’t matter only if you go 1 stop)

Expo (E) line takes you directly to the coliseum for USC games, and will get you to Culver City/santa Monica in about an hour

Blue (A) line cuts through the roughest parts of town, gets you to Long Beach a little over an hour, connect to the green line at imperial Wilmington (105) station

The new Crenshaw (K) Line runs from Expo/Crenshaw station on the Expo (E) line if you’re looking to head south and want to avoid the Blue (A) line</Review>

Be prepared to see any and everything. Also the Metro Police will stand on the entrance of the turnstile and still ask you for your TAP card to verify. I am like you just saw me tap my card.< /text>

Possibly the worst build up to an opening in have ever seen. Metro Expo Line to Downtown Santa Monica only opened about a month ago and there has already been EXTREME over crowding, broken A/C, break downs, broken announcement speakers, broken screens that tell you where you are. This is RIDICULOUS, Metro has been building up to the amazing extension to Santa Monica and it has become a train wreck (pun not intended).< /text>

Subway is very warm, and MTA response is 15 min wait for purple line and increasing heat in tunnel.  MTA punish & abuse riders for complaining.  Mayor and Ridley-thomas ignore complaints as well.

No one accountable.  My train is 2 min late,  so 17 min wait in heated tunnel.</Review>

(Translated by Google) A subway in the LA area, a light rail station (union station if using a metro link). There is UNIQLO. We can go to Santa Monica, Hollywood, Koreatown and Long Beach. There are also buses to Disneyland from nearby bus stops.

(Original)
LAエリアの地下鉄、ライトレールの拠点と言える駅(メトロリンク使うならユニオンステーション)。ユニクロがある。サンタモニカ、ハリウッド、コリアタウン、ロングビーチにも行ける。近くのバス停からディズニーランド行きのバスも出ている。<//review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) It's okay, but with a European eye, it's an untidy, old-fashioned network, and the vending machine is barely understandable. There are also a lot of pipes in the subway, which would be unthinkable for us.

Rendben van, de európai szemmel viszont rendezetlen, régies hálozat, az automata is alig érthető. Sok a csöves a metróban is, ami nálunk elképzelhetetlen lenne.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>(Translated by Google) People who went to Santa Monica by the sea go to Expo Line (light blue).
If you want to get to Hollywood, take the Red Line.
People who go to Long Beach go to the Blue Line.
Somehow, there is Santa Monica station in the middle of the red line, but it is not by the sea. I come out before college. You can access the red line, purple line, blue line and expo line (light blue).

レッドラインの途中に、何とかサンタモニカ駅がありますが海沿いではありません。大学の前にでます。レッドライン、パープルライン、ブルーライン、エキスポライン（水色）にアクセスできます。<//Review><resp>None<//resp><user_id>101544414004277854517</user_id><GmapID>0x80c2c7b6aaffe2b9:0x8a94aa5c750d3172</GmapID><pics>None< /pics></record>

Jeff is such a baller, along with his apprentice, Brenton. I acquired a bike that needed the rubber inner tubing replaced. It was in dire need of service.

I called Jeff and even with the standard hourly charge and price on the new tube, after I brought it in he gave me the flat fix charge which minimized my cost. I'm so grateful for his customer service and ethics.

Thanks Stray Dog, I'll return in due time.<//Text>

But despite it being a small problem he was honest. He wasn’t trying to sell me on anything despite the condition of my bike. I’d highly recommend this shop.
Professional, honest and great customer service.<//text>< pics>

Bicycles can be extremely complicated but Jeff is very knowledgeable and took the time to answer my questions.  He is bringing the neighborhood feel back to the bike shop through service and care.  He sincerely wants his customers to enjoy cycling and keeping value in mind.  I recommend any cyclist at any level to go on in!! Cheers<//review>

<review>If your looking for a bicycle store, do yourself a favor and choose any other store except this one.
Jeff is the owner with s makor attitude problem.  He had been known to cheat people on pricing for repairs and tune ups. He had made promises that he cant keep.
I have sent several bike owner to his lying, cheating establishment which were both disappointed in his service as well as his mechanical repairs and tune ups. All three of my referrals were extremely disappointed and felt that they were undermined in conversation regarding indebt discussions on bicycle talk.
His tone and disposition is horrible.
If your curious...go for it.  I promise this review is very accurate.< /review><GmapID>0x809a59c64bb2340d:0xd77728b35712e6bc</GmapID><resp>None< /resp>< name>

Went there to see if they had a particular and rare size tube with a bent valve, 6 x 1 1/4, which they don't have. The guy there was very kind though. Removed the tubes from the small tires which was a chore in itself. He seemed happy to help even tho there was nothing in it for him. Will probably take my regular bike there when it needs another tune up.</review>

<text>Jeff was really nice and took care of my bike and my wife’s bike. If you don’t know a lot about bicycles he is very helpful and makes you feel confident about the bike you are riding. He also helped to outfit my 1 year and 8 month old son with a helmet.</text>< pictures>

I travel past all the local shops in my town. Just to get the personalized and very friendly care from the owner and his wife. The only ones i have met besides the dogs. Ordered a bike and had it before Christmas. Offered to deliver but picked it up myself. We are entry level and cant afford much anyway but got the perfect bike for our needs. So far the customer service is well above any I have had in any shop.
Customers must learn to wait for the moment when a busy shop can afford the time to spend with you. I wait and always get superior service.
It goes both ways.<//review>

<text>Outstanding customer service with great attention to detail. I am very happy to have found this great bike shop. Jeff is very helpful and I hate to sound so cliche but I find a lot of the big name bike shops often overlook their female customers. At stray dog I experienced such exemplary service that I felt compelled to share my positive afternoon< /text>< response>

This place just has a really good neighborhood bike shop feel. Most of the time when I go in the owner is there himself,  which I always like to see. They're willing to make the effort to get you what you want, and they didn't gouge me on price. I felt they were willing to put way more effort in for my business than other shops.  Great place where I will continue to take my business.< /review>

I am a local Rocklin cyclist and have tried this shop a few times. Just for some small service issues and purchases and advice. I am not a bike mechanic or bike expert. That is why i ask questions. I have never received a straight answer or had the guy at the shop not be a bit of a jerk. The prices here are not better no worse than the shops in Roseville or Auburn. But the service at the other shops is way way better. That is why i will no longer try to support my local Rocklin shop but will travel to Roseville or Auburn. Big thumbs down to this place.< /review>

This place is where you need to go for a wealth of bicycle knowledge and speedy courteous service! I also found the prices super reasonable when I got my Cannondale rear axle fixed this afternoon!  What a great comfortable bike shop with a friendly vibe. Take your bike here!<//Review>

<text>The owner and the staff there are always helpful and knowledgable. Whenever I bring my bike in for any reason they always take the time to look at it and fix it right away if it's not something that takes too long. No matter what I take it in for they go over the whole bike to make sure everything is working properly and advise me if something should be replaced or repaired. I love riding more now that my bike performs as well as it should. I am very glad I happened to come across this store. Any parts needed or any new bike will be purchased from Stray Dog Bicycles.</text></record></dataset><record>

Great customer service.  I was riding my bike in the neighborhood and was experiencing some rubbing on my break pads so stopped by (I had recently replaced them myself and was afraid I had messed them up).  The wheel quick-release just needed a little tightening, which they did right there on the spot.  Tightened up the handlebars while they were at it.  Bike is running like new.  I'm planning to upgrade my road bike's group-set next year and they will be the first shop I call.< /text>

<text>I have purchase two bicycles from Sharp over the years.

This is an owner/operator store - not like other stores where the owner is off doing something else while the customers get shoddy service or incomplete answers from kids working in the store.

The combined experience is here is great - they will fix you up giving you straight answers all the way through.

Best of all they feature Specialized bikes and accessories - the best out there  IMHO.

Give then a look at their new location.< /text>< pics>

Had posted this restaurant in the past but haven't gone for awhile them Covid-19 hit so now that places to eat are starting to let dine in decided to go revisit this place an was happy to still see it there since alot of restaurants had to close so seeing this place still there was nice. Plus looks like it got a make-over an it looks wonderful. Jug of coldwater / iced glasses are given as you sit for you to enjoy. Food there still great, serves too. Worth going again. Come an give this place a visit if havent gone for awhile like me or going for the first time. Either way it's a treat.</text>

<rate>2</rate><text>Service was horrible and waitresses were clearly annoyed. Lemonade was warm and tasteless. The picture of the lemonade is in a nice mason jar with lemon slices, but it came in a plastic to-go cup. They didn't want to make my friend papaya salad because I wasn't happy with the lemonade...how does that make sense 🤔🤔🤔 Food was okay. Salt and pepper chicken wings were good. Spring rolls were good. I was surprised this place had such high ratings. Maybe they are known for a signature dish. I won't be back✌🏾<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<GmapID>0x809addc2607215af:0xe7bbbffe9ba31504< /GmapID><Text>Located in the Carmichael Oaks Shopping Center is this simple, casual, South-Vietnamese restaurant. This was our return visit, this time for lunch. The broths and seasoning tend to run on the sweeter side. They get bonus points for a few vegan options and brown rice.  My favorite was the fresh grilled salmon roll. The hot salmon contrasted nicely with cold noodles and lettuce. The waitress forgot about my order for salt and pepper tofu. I did takeout on the fried egg rolls.< /Text>< Name>

<review>Pho House (formerly Pho #1) has awesome food! Been going to Pho#1 for years. The food is always fresh, affordable and Delicious!

Family favs include the Salt n Pepper Calamari, Salmon Spring Rolls,  Grilled Pork Vermicelli,  and the Chicken Pho. The Green Papaya salad is refreshing and flavorful! ❤

Delicious Pho! Very clean new feel. Order up front and waitress brings out food and busses tables. Even a play area for young kids. Definitely going back.</Text>

Best of the best!!! Yummy food, the pho soup is AWESOMELY DELICIOUS especially if you are looking to cure a hangover or have a good but not too big of a snack. The wings and the strimps are 😋 🍻 👌👌👌</Text>

Hmm I came to this place because of the great reviews and photos.. Place was clean but service was a little skeptical and weird.. Food looked good but tasted plain and I wanted a different type of sauce with my order and the lady that took my order refused and told me it would not taste right with what I ordered.. so I said fine and got my food and left. My stomach is bubbling as I type this review. I will not be back.. ever</text>

<review>Love their food! Spicy Beef Pho is my favorite.  The salt & pepper shrimp is delicious,  too.  We've tried several other dishes as well and been very satisfied.   We also purchase the broth to make soup at home.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x809addc2607215af:0xe7bbbffe9ba31504</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
We came in at noon and placed order for pho, bun bo hue, and spring rolls.   We asked when we placed the order if they can expedite the order as my son fencing class resumes at 1 pm.  When it was 12:45, I approached a lady server who told me to ask someone else because she was busy!  When I came back and asked for one of the order to go because my son has to go to class, they did not look please.  Interesting because I had to go get my own napkins and utensils.   The pho was okay,  not spectacular,  although the serving size was generous.  Not being from CA, I was expecting more.  At least the bathroom was clean.  That is too bad because we were hoping to come back because we are here for the rest of the week.   The man server was pleasant.

ADDENDUM:  The bun bo hue was delicious, even at home.  I can only imagined how good it would have taste at the restaurant.  If it had not been for the service, we would have gone back.<//review>

<Review>The food was amazing and the serving sizes are big enough to share, so for only 10 bucks, I'd even give it 6 stars but that's not on the scale. It's a bit confusing on how the service works but the food is amazing and I definitely reccomend.</Review>< GmapID>

My boyfriend and I had a fantastic experience. The staff were knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating when one member of my party cancelled at the last minute. I have done a few kayaking trips and the (Jackson) kayaks that we paddled in were especially comfortable to use. Baby geese and ducks swam along side us, we saw turtles sunning themselves, and blue herons strutting through the reeds, it was a pretty magical experience.<//Text>

Fantastic establishment!!  It was a great place 10 years ago when I first went and it's only getting better!  Exquisite customer service and an exceptionally beautiful kayak run.  They allow dogs unlike other rental spots.  Bring your pooch they will enjoy and you'll get a better workout!  Thanks River's Edge for being an outstanding business!!</review>

<Review>My husband and I took a double kayak for 5 miles on the Russian River in early May. The abundant flora and fauna of the area kept the ride relaxing and entertaining. The combination of rowing and sunlight made the water the perfect temperature for cooling off. We were provided with water, hair ties, glasses savers and the staff did a great job of getting us trained on how to paddle and steer. The water level was moderately low and we hand to get out of the kayak to push ourselves over mounds of river stones a handful of times. A great activity to last ~2.5 hours or a whole day if you stop to picnic along the river.< /Review><user_name>Sasha Walker< /user_name>< resp>

Great experience! Saw some cool wildlife. Relatively quiet on the river. Only passed a few sections with houses and busy beaches but mostly uninhabited. Very professional staff, stemless experience.

Note: I did notice that Burke's nearby is half the price for the same thing but wasn't open yet.<//text>

You can expect 2-3 hours of paddling and plenty of opportunities for stops on the way for picnics (which we did), or sight seeing. We saw plenty of animals on this tour.

Had a fabulous and relaxing time floating down the river. This trip is very laid back and peaceful, especially in the late summer when the water level on the river is getting pretty low. I did this trip in late Aug 2020 just after the big wildfires and, while a little smoky, the air was fine. I also thought the staff at River's Edge have appropriate measures in place to ensure everyone is safe from transmitting covid-19. All the equipment is sanitized after each use, everyone is wearing a mask, they have hand washing stations, and maintain a safe seating distance on the short shuttle ride. It's all good people - get outside and have some fun!<//review>

Beautiful stretch of river, peaceful, with a few interesting animals.  The water was a bit shallow though so late in the year (and the dam was never put up this year for some reason due to COVID).  Still, happy I had the chance of going on this trip, even it being so late in the year.<//Text>

<username>Adam Bradley< /username><Text>This was the summer, and year, that didn't happen. With so many trips across the country cancelled, my wife and I have been trying to do local outdoor activities, and we love kayaking when we're on the Leelanau Peninsula in northern Michigan, so we sought to do that in CA. We found River's Edge, made a reservation for an open weekend, but were concerned that the smoke from recent and ongoing fires would force us to postpone or cancel this trip. I called the Thursday before and was told that we were free to cancel or postpone up to the day of if we felt unsafe being outdoors near the Sonoma fires. They called us again Friday to expound upon their cancellation policy and offer full refunds if we wanted because of the fires and smoke. Saturday morning came and the air quality was good enough to go out, so we did! We had a great time on the Upper Russian River, they were professional and friendly, and we would definitely do this again next season.<//Text><GmapID>0x80841721151b10dd:0x365f74072a33b5c3< /GmapID><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3w1YvbAElqxHLHSOsI27cmkcnQemWeC2Zm49A=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< user_id>

This was a great activity for my family. It took us about 3 hours to make it down the river and we had a couple of stops to swim. The River's Edge staff were super friendly and professional. They have taken several steps to keep guests and staff safe. We really enjoyed it and will be back!< /Review>

<text>The staff at River's Edge are personable and very accommodating.  We were running a bit late on the return and Dave met us on the river, he was looking for us...and once he found us, showed us some baby otter's and their parents, making the finish of our trip so interesting and fun.  We will come back again and again!</text>< pictures>

The overall experience was great. We booked a double kayak with them. They were happy to give paddle instructions, the do's and don'ts.
Before, you start make sure you take care of restroom breaks. The restroom facility with River's Edge is not that great.</Review>

I have paddled with Rivers Edge for several years with groups as large as 30 teens - adults.  It’s such a simple trip to make and setup for any level of adventurer.  Lollie is so great to work with, her response is quick and her support and communication skills are friendly and professional.  I look forward to many years of paddling with Rivers Edge!

My family and I have been coming here for years and they never disapoint! The staff is always welcoming, they provide dry bags, coolers, glasses straps, garbage bags, and seat cushions! The 5-mile trek of river is absolutely gorgeous and the water is so clear you can see the bottom in all but the deepest parts! We just went on Saturday(June 6th) and I already made a reservation for this coming Sunday to do it again! I will always recommend going here! And there is a great ice cream place right next door!< /Review>

<text>Best day in the sun ever! The employees were very friendly, helpful and gave clear directions. They even helped me tie down my bag to the boat. I honestly could not have had a better day. $70 seemed like a bit much for a kayak at first, but by the end of the day I thought it was 100% worth it. Please note: do not wear flip flops like the website says - you will probably use one like I did. Have fun out there!<//text>< pics>

<review>We had an outstanding time.  Super friendly staff and they make things easy for you with dry-bags, coolers, etc.  We went in May when the river was running quickly and had a magnificent time.

We returned and had another trip and it was just as wonderful.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

If you are choosing between Burke’s at Guerneville and here, I like this experience better.  The river is warmer and clearer further from the ocean and they bus you to the launch and you land where your car is, so no waiting on the return.  It’s a faster and shorter run but they may open up a longer run again later this summer.< /text>

We went last Friday and this is a well run operation. These folks are awesome. We arrived slightly late and returned late and they were still cool. One bonus to the trip is that you get to go off-roading in a school bus to get to your canoes. It was a beautiful day. The river has a couple rope swings and rock to jump off into the water. Our kids who insisted on having their own canoe only rolled it once making for some unforgettable stories in the future. We'll be back. Highly recommended wine country family activity.<//Review>

these people are pros. from the info, to the waterproof bags to ice coolers to hold water they have for you, and ice cold water on your return..you go with the group that arrives to be shuttled, but quickly you are out in wilderness with beautiful scenery and warm water.good workout! spotless accommodations too.< /Text>

Chris, Dale, Joe and Lollie. Wow. Great svc. They care about the River and each other and the clients. We did 1/2 day with our 11 yr old son & his 14 yr old cousin.  No tablets, no video games, what a concept! Had a Blast.
Tip--purchase a waterproof camera case for ur cell, or buy a waterproof digital camera. Cuz ur gonna want to take LOTS of pictures. And pulling ur cell out of a plastic bag every 2 mins is annoying. River was clean, u can see right thru the water down to the bottom in most places. California is in a severe drought so the water was a little thin in a few spots, but still a lot of fun. Highly recommend! Want to go back ASAP. But we live in Los Angeles :-(</Text>

We wanted to do the Alex Trip. I got an email saying we should be there at 9am, however check-in time was 8:30 AM apparently. So when we got there the shuttle had just left. They said they called me the day before, which they didn't. We could only go on the boring Rio trip instead. Not happy with their communication.< /review>

< Review>
Excellent and professional service! We had our couch and rugs cleaned by DVA. Dennis showed up right on time and did a great job cleaning everything. He even took our wool rug home to clean it at his shop so that it would properly dry. Prices were very reasonable and we definitely recommend DVA.< /Review>

He came to my house to give me an estimate and after shopping around for a while, I decided to call DVA back. He provided the best prices and great equipment as well! So DVA came today to clean my carpets and tile and bathroom and laundry room. When we did the inspection when everything was done, I loved how clean and detailed he was. He went as far as to slide my fridge and stove back in their place. Thank you. You did a great job. I will call you later on for my sofas and other stuff.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<user>115168615846674695386< /user><Review>WOW!!! Amazing work done by Dennis. The carpets in my room were filthy. After 7 years of having roommates my carpets were beyond dirty. People told me I shoulda had my carpets removed and replaced with new ones but I decided to take a risk on a carpet cleaning service and I'm glad I went with DVA Carpet Cleaning. Dennis was quick and efficient. He cleaned 3 rooms and my couches!! Worth every penny as I would have spent more money replacing the carpets and the couches. I normally don't write reviews but I felt compelled to write one for DVA Carpet Cleaning because of the end product. Highly recommend!!!< /Review><pics>None</pics></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Dennis showed up early & ready to work! It was such a pleasure to have someone dedicated & proud of their work service our home. Having 3 toddlers, our stairs & 4 other rooms were in deep need of TLC which Dennis executed very well. 10/10 recommended, I will be using him for all our needs! Thanks again, you did amazing!</Text>< Date>

<text>Let me tell you Dennis  with DVA Carpet cleaning was so amazing! On time, professional, and worked very hard. Carpet cleaned from a horrible coffee accident. And sectional and  kitchen chairs look brand new. Very friendly and efficient. Love that I was paying someone for their services and goes right to them not a corporation. Thank you Dennis!!<//text>< Pics>

<review>Dennis from DVA Carpet Cleaning did an amazing job at cleaning our carpet. I appreciate the fact that he moved his schedule around to fit our needs.  He was able to come within a 24 hour span.  That was awesome.
Support small business owners like these!! He was very professional and punctual.

Not only was he timely and professional, Dennis was courteous and extraordinary with the delivery of services. I have children therefore needed help getting rid of some stains and dirt on my couches, ottoman, and dining chairs. Dennis exceeded my expectations and I am thrilled to see my beautiful furniture come back to life. I can’t wait for his return as he will be cleaning all of my carpet and stairs. Definitely recommend. He is affordable, honest and passionate about his work!!<//text>

Does cleaning for 2 large buildings for an organization that I’m part of, and his work is noteworthy. Would highly recommend him for carpet and area rug cleaning!

He was extremely professional and respectful. Very fast and efficient work, I highly recommend. He provided clear expectations as to how much of the couch’s stains could be removed and he was true to his word. To me that is the most important. Some people just tell you what you want to hear and then their work falls flat, which I don’t appreciate. This was the opposite. Great work, will be using his device again!< /review>

Our dog is getting old and had several accidents on our carpet one night, leaving multiple stains. Our entire house reeked...until Dennis came! DVA Carpet Cleaning is professional, he came on time, his prices are VERY reasonable and he does an amazing job! Our carpet looks better than it has in the last seven years. He got rid of all the pet stains and the odor. Thank you Dennis! We will be calling him a couple times a year to keep the carpets clean, and I definitely recommend him!</text><userid>106241317605425887575<//userid><Rating>5<//Rating>< date>

I called DVA carpet cleaning for a quote, sight unseen and was able to get scheduled immediately. Very reasonable price and the work quality is great. It was such breeze dealing with them from the initial call all the way to when the work was done. Will definitely call them again in the future.< /Review>

Such an awesome job done! I cannot recommend them highly enough. We are about to have our first child and decided to get the carpets in our living room, hallway and nursery done. He was able to make them look close to new and was done quickly! The carpets are beautiful, fresh, and clean now! He was quick to respond and the pricing can’t be beat.< /Text>

<user_name>Connie Moise</user_name><date>1608068568136</date><Text>This company goes above and beyond! Our tenant left our rental home with horrific pet stains. DVA Carpet Cleaning came on time and professionally cleaned the carpet, which now smells good too. While here, the technician used a special light to show my husband where pet stains appeared on the walls. While my husband was at work, I partially cleaned up some of the walls, but was unsure about the location of some of the stains so I called DVA Carpet Cleaning to ask if they could tell me about the special light they used - thinking I might purchase one. The technician offered to come back over and show me any remaining wall stains, which he did about 20 minutes after my call! This company practices quality service and demonstrates that they care about their customers. In addition, they gave us a very good price, especially compared with quotes we obtained from other carpet cleaning companies. We will definitely use DVA Carpet Cleaning service again.<//Text><UserId.>102426122172964109060<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

They do such a great job!! They cleaned up all the stains we had from using dirty shoes on carpet to dog pee odor removal. They came in with a black light and spotted all the dog pee stains something no other carpet cleaner had ever done. Once they were done it took about 2 hours to dry which is so fast compared to others. The carpet looked just as clean as when we first moved in.< /Review>

Thank you so much for taking care of my grandmother's new house and making her feel comfortable on her carpets! I definitely recommend adding the Pet odor service if pets are or were ever at the house! It's nice to know you aren't being taken advantage of and getting the best possible service! Especially when you are in a bind and sellers left the house a disaster 😳 Thank you again DVA!</Text>

Dennis is a great guy, very professional. He got my carpet, that was super dirty from my kids being home all Covid, clean and smelling great.  I especially like that he uses professional chemicals and equipment, he's proud of the work he does, and he even had fans to start the drying process.< /Text>

<text>Dennis is a great guy, very professional. He got my carpet, that was super dirty from my kids being home all Covid, clean and smelling great.  I especially like that he uses professional chemicals and equipment, he's proud of the work he does, and he even had fans to start the drying process.</text><rating>5<//rating><gmapID>0x80c2595b244b4681:0x3867b0d2ff923511<//gmapID><username>C Darayl<//username><Time>1604514526154<//Time><Response>None</Response><userid>112962536294761248179< /userid>< Pics>

<Text>Dennis was absolutely amazing ! We have used him multiple times , not only for our carpet but for our couch as well.  He does amazing work , and he was even able to get out multiple patches of smile that my kids has smashed into very plush carpet.  I was so impressed and I will continue to use DVA for all my carpet and upholstery cleaning services ! Thank you Dennis!< /Text>< pics>

My carpet was overdue for a cleaning. I found this company by googling carpet cleaning nearby. After reading through their excellent reviews on google and yelp I called for a quote and set up an appt.

Dennis was on time and friendly. I showed him the 3 rooms to be cleaned and my 2 big rugs. He got right to work and was done in a little over an hour. I also got a quote for having my tile grout cleaned and he came in with a great price.

My carpet looks so nice and clean again! Thank you Dennis for your excellent service :)< /Review>

<text>Honestly the best carpet cleaning services I’ve had. I’ve been his client for years now and I have never been disappointed! He is very thorough & makes sure your carpet, couches, chairs, etc are well cleaned. I recommend DVA 100% and always tell my real estate clients and friends about him too.</text>< rate>

Dennis was on right on time like we scheduled he was kind and professional. He accommodated next even though my apts didn’t have water access he found a solution.
His work was fast and effective. He cleaned four areas and two couches both look GREAT! Really satisfied with this service the price. Highly recommended.

Thanks Dennis!<//review>

<Review>I Found DVA on Instagram at a first glance it appeared to be a very small service not a lot of traction following him. But it really looked like he knew what he was doing i decided to give him a call and it was very simple super easy straight forward with making an appointment. Upon arrival, he was very friendly courteous polite and easy to approach loved his energy his enthusiasm and more than anything his passion for a job sure the service is where it matters but in a time and age where standards and ethics are no more this is highly appraised in my book. I had to change my plan of cleaning all carpets and he did not seem bothered what so ever he embraced it and was extremely professional and smiled. Gave me peace of mind he would still do an outstanding job regardless, I will definitely be calling him for any of my jobs and spreading the word, the carpet looks awesome cleaning was quick one room of 10x10 done in under an hour with heavy traffic marks looks great highly recommend Dennis! Really satisfy!<//Review>< pictures>

I desperately needed my carpet cleaned after i finished potty training my kid. I found DVA carpet Cleaning & Dennis was able to schedule me for that week & wow i was so relieved to have clean carpet again, it looked like new! Plussss it didn’t cost me an arm and a leg. It’s really hard to find someone who is affordable and great service! I highly recommend!</text>

I have a dog who loves to lick his paws and this has caused stains on the couch which I would use a blanket to cover. Not only that, but my room carpet had really bad stains from years ago not really sure what the stains where anymore. I called DVA Carpets and Dennis came over and within a hour those stains were gone. The downtime in walking on the carpet again as the drying was so quick. Truly amazed!! No more blanket to cover stains on the couch and won’t need to be embarrassed when company is over.</Review>

Couldn’t speak more highly of my experience with Holden. Healed a deep shoulder pain I’ve had for 12 years in under 5 minutes. Needless to say, I was stunned. He’s uniquely gifted at scanning the body in a holistic way and identifying the often hidden and unexpected root cause of pain.<//Review>

<Text>A gifted healer. Just by looking at you, Holden can tell what's out of balance and he knows exactly how to fix it. I have scoliosis and left shoulder trauma from a car accident. I'm also a triathlete. Holden customized my treatment to target exactly what I needed to continue to train and to just feel good. He also has the best bedside manner; relaxed, chill, and a genuine want for you to be pain-free. I could not possibly recommend Holden/MetaTouch Body Balance any higher.< /Text><resp>None</resp><user_name>Rich Rubin</user_name><rate>5<//rate>< time>

If nothing seems to be working...  THIS WILL!  I'm an active person and have dealt with some chronic pain in my hips and knees. since my mid 20's.  I'm a triathlete; training for an ironman and went to  Holden for help.  His intuition and innovative techniques had me walking out of there AND training 15-20 hours a week pain-free.  I recently broke my wrist and have been seeing Holden to speed up my recovery from the surgery.  My OT can't believe the progress we've made so quickly!  I can't say enough about this place.   It's a life changer..</review>

Incredible work performed by Holden. I never really have suffered an injury before, and I had knee pain that popped out of no where. Desperately wanting to get back to my intensive exercising , Holden had me exercising again in 3 days. He taught me more about my body than any doctor specializing in podiatry or scolioses I grew up seeing. Thank you so much for everything! Fantastic experience:)</Review>

<review>Holden is very good at looking at you and knowing where you are unbalanced, bunched up or cramped! He manipulates your muscles, tendons and bones back to where they are supposed to be. I swear I am an inch taller when he is done with me. He also has a dry sense of humor and has me in stitches while he works on me. Holden is an amazing kinesiologist and I am grateful to have him in my life!</review><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba173bf4a0e5:0x1e3ac6e0fde2e688</Gmap_id><UserId.>100018911640946373455< /UserId.>< username>

<text>I just saw Holden for much needed alignment. The session went great -- I was seated on time, Holden was very informative and explained the reasoning behind his techniques and the best part is I feel much much better now. It's very clear that exercise alone is not enough to stay healthy and and these sessions are a great starting point. Five Stars for sure.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Holden is a miracle worker! I’m so grateful for his healing skills and understanding of the mind and body connection. Yesterday I came to his office with sever neck pain. He gracefully treated my neck and then got to the root of my pain with a full body Energy Healing session! It was extraordinary - just like Gwyneth Paltrow’s recent Goop Lab episode on Energy Healing. I have to say I was a true skeptic of the type of treatment and nothing but a BIG believer now! The healing was instant and I still feel light as a feather today, Thank You Holden!< /review>

<Text>Holden is the best, I mean the greatest massage therapist ever.  He's so amazing that each time I go for an appointment, I can't wait until I go
again.  Holden is so thorough, you really feel so relaxed & fully renewed.
It's a family affair with Holden, my family all feel the same about Holden
that is a total therapeutic experience !

I recommend Holden very highly for your personalized and individual treatment, so don't wait to schedule your appointment.</Text></record>

I have used the services of Meta Touch for a few years now, and have always been satisfied by their expertise, their professionalism and their cordial, friendly attitude. Kathy, who has taken care of me  has always left me revived and relaxed after each session. I would recommend Meta Touch  very highly without hesitation or reservations.</review>

MetaTouch is exactly as my friend who recommended it to me described. It's a no-frills kind of place that is meant to dig in and fix you up. Quite possibly one of the most effective massages that I have had. My therapist got to the problem and worked it out very well.</Text>

I started treatment at MetaTouch about a year and a half ago, following a  motorcycle accident which resulted in a fractured L2. I had heard Holden called a "true healer" many times before but only until I was on the table did I understand the truth behind that sentiment.
Holden worked with me for months providing therapeutic massage and significantly impacting my ability to heal. Over the course of several weeks and months we were able to generate blood flow and relieve much of the tension and stiffness that was held in my middle-lower back.
Later, I began acupuncture with Norma. Norma's skill and ability are unparalleled. Acupuncture was intimidating to me at first but with Norma's personable, personalized and educational approach, I felt very comfortable. She is experienced, knowledgeable, and an all around wonderful human.
I recommend MetaTouch to anyone looking for a trustworthy wellness center. Whether recovering from a significant injury or simply looking for some skilled hands to alleviate your stress MetaTouch will take very good care of you, as they continue to do for me.< /text>

I went to MetaTouch for a couple different issues.  Holden did his assessment on me and then got to work.  When I picture a massage that is to get kinks out and help with specific issues, I picture it not being very comfortable and maybe a bit painful.  With Holden, none of the process was painful and it was super effective! It was amazing and it's great to be in proper alignment with my body!!!  Thank you MetaTouch.<//text>

Cathy was AWESOME!, she definitely has the magic touch. I really like the Zen set up that Meta Touch offers in their individual rooms, with dim lights, soft music, and aroma therapy to set you right to relax, what an Awesome experience, I most definitely recommend Meta Touch to All.

Thanks again Cathy!< /Text>

< Review>
My wife & I have been seeing Holden since September 2007 when I needed physical therapy due to training with Capoeira.
And now as somewhat "Seasoned Citizens" experiencing the normal challenges of getting more mature he has been a God sent blessing to us!
The staff at MetaTouch is courteous, caring and professional.
You won't be disappointed with Holden Zalma & MetaTouch.<//Review>

<user_id>112727094723382141722< /user_id><Date>1459738601792</Date><Text>After two pregnancies and breast feeding for about 3 years my body was in need of some TLC. Holden was very warm and personable and made what can be an awkward situation (being half naked under a little sheet) a comfortable and relaxing experience.  I had sprained my back several months earlier and was unsure if I even needed to be "fixed" (as it had more or less healed) but I had some tension in my neck and shoulders and still would feel tingling in my back on occasions. My husband has known Holden for many years now and would always return from his visits with him as if he had seen a miracle worker! I finally decided it was my turn for a change.  Holden gave me a short assessment and pointed out that not only was my neck locked up but my left hip was locked and three ribs were out of place.  Oh the joys of having children! I left MetaTouch feeling loose, relaxed and refreshed.  I would definitely recommend anyone to pay them a visit!< /Text>< Rate>

I was very impressed with not only the professionalism but the honesty of this companies employee. I called because I needed a whole new key and fob for a Nissan. First they arrived ahead of schedule, second it was discovered that when the car was towed the key fell on the side of the seat. The tech noticed this at the time he was making a copy and pointed that out. Normally I would have had a 2nd key made but with times the way they are money’s tight. So because of the techs professionalism and honesty the $200 bill became $75. I’ve already recommended 2 people and I will continue to do so with anyone that can use their services. Thanks again and I will definitely call if I need you again, you have a customer for life.< /text>

The driver did an great job, I lost my key to my club bar. He was able to get the club off my car. Said he wouldn’t be able to make a key for the club. It’s alright. I told him I didn’t care about a key I just want the club off my car. He put my cover back on and was polite, kind, and took care of me quickly. Being alone at midnight , he made me feel not to be scared. An excellent team member for AAA, thank you. This is the very reason I have AAA for myself and my daughter.
Thank you for great service at a time when I really needed your help.
Sincerely, Connie Chatwin

<rate>5<//rate><Text>If you need a reliable local locksmith, I cannot recommend The Key Crew enough. We woke up Sunday to find someone tried to steal our Ford F-150. We immediately called The Key Crew Locksmith and Nate was here in 15 minutes.  While he was working on our lock he gave us a free jump to make sure our battery was fully charged.

Unfortunately, the thief’s did so much damage to the ignition, the part they needed, Ford no longer makes.  So instead of saying, nope we can’t do the job they went above and beyond.  They researched on Ebay and junkyards to get us the best price.  As soon as the part came, Tim, one of the owners, personally came out to fix it. They had us up and going in no time.  Trust the Key Crew to take care of all your locksmith needs.< /Text>< Pics>

They did great job and better. Used them twice. Very professional. First time the guy is pro. Second time the guy was in training from first. Hard job and nailed it. Both times was told no charge. I won’t need any other company in the future. Down to earth pros.</text>

He demonstrated great familiarity with his craft. I am super satisfied. If I ever have lock problems, I'll call Peter first thing.</Review>< pictures>

Michael's the man! Michael was able to successfully duplicate a spare motorcycle key for me using a OEM microchipped blank (which I bought and brought in from the dealership)! He even made sure that the newly cut key was mechanically functioning on my bike before he charged my credit card! Michael was very professional and efficient - highly recommend The Key Crew off Admas Ave!</text>

Alex was amazingly responsive, friendly & professional in helping us unlock our pantry door on a Saturday night.  He was able to unlock the door within minutes!  I would highly recommend him as his prices are very fair and service was superb.< /Text>

After 32 years of driving the same car, yesterday when trying to start my 1989 Ford Mustang convertible  I couldn’t get the ignition switch to budge!
I called AAA and after a few suggestions of theirs it still would give so they said they’d  dispatch a lock specialist.
I was told the arrival time may be lengthy but it was not bad at all...he met me at my car in under a half hour.
Nate was the technician who came out and he was wonderful.
My switch was a bit of pain in the butt trying to remove and it did he say It was taking  longer than most ignition switch repairs but I had a book and didn’t mind the wait.
He installed the new switch and gave me the new key and I was safely on my way home.
I highly recommend Nate.
He knows what he’s doing and he’s polite and followed all the Covid safety protocol as well.</text>

This is the 2nd time I had to use this service. The first time I had an emergency and missed my appointment at the hospital because no one showed up for 4 hours. This time no one ever showed up at all because they said they were trying to  call but I told the dispatcher that I had no phone so they  never showed up. Is this the way you treat your premier member?not once but twice. What do I pay you for.<//Review>

{'time': 1614371896136, 'text': 'Hi Virginia, my understanding is the AAA phone/computer systems in Texas were out because of the crazy storm and that is where CA dispatching is coming out of.  I’m so sorry you were left waiting for us, AAA never informed us. If you don’t mind removing this review, this was an error for AAA, not our company. Please reach out to AAA to discuss any issues you had or give us a call if you have any questions. Thanks, have a good day.'}<//Resp>

I was recently on a date with my wife and when we got back to our house we realized we both left the keys in the house and locked ourselves out. This was a really annoying way to end the night but Alex was able to make it a quick and easy process.
We found The Key Crew Locksmith on google , and Alex came out to our house in Union Square within 15 minutes. He is extremely professional and knowledgeable. He got us back into the house in minutes!

Save your time and call The Key Crew Locksmith!!</Review>

I came across The Key Crew who quickly put me at ease, they were professional and informative from the very first phone call!.

The were effective with leaving notes for the next person, they were auperbquick in dispatching, they were organized with communication between the team and the guy that camenout "Tim" went above and beyond!

Time really made me feel taken care of, the cost was super reasonable, he explained everything and did everything he could to get me back on the road!

I am very lucky to have found them! As a girl in need, they really took care of me and made me feel independent that I didn't need to count on anyone else but them! From begining to end! This was definitely the crew for me!

Thank you for all you do !

Great service.  In and out.  Installed a new battery in my car fob.  Have used before at their old location.  There is a small parking lot in back or street parking.  There is a reasonable mobile locksmith service that will rekey your house locks, install new locks, or provide other services such as if you lock the keys in your car.  Highly recommend.<//Review>

After loosing my keys with the key fob, I couldn't turn on my car with my spare. I called The Key Crew Locksmith to find out if they can provide a key fob. Instead they guided us step by step how to enable my car so I can turn it on! This guy was amazing :) we were so happy especially it being after hours and the customer service was beyond our expectations!<//Text>

I needed to cut a new key and reprogram a new set of key fobs. Jimmy had me out the door and on my way in about 15 minutes. They gave me a great quote and were super professional. Thanks!<//text>

These folks were overly gracious with their time and energy and resources... Fully patient, compentent, kind, and made themselves readily available... even when the T-Mobile Metro PCS service went down and they couldn't reach me by phone they hung out until we crossed paths at my service address... this team has your best interests at heart! Outstanding correspondence and customer service...plus AAA discount!! Thanks for everything Key Crew!<//Review>

Highly recommend this company!! Had a door knob fail and I couldn’t get into my daughters room. Called at 8:30pm and by 9:30 Nate came and diagnosed the problem and was able to figure out how to get into the room with no damage to the door and frame! Nate is the man!!!</Review>

<review>Wow! I lost one of my Toyota car fob/keys and the dealership quoted me a crazy high price. I found the The Key Crew on google and their website is sleek and easy to use. With a quick phone call I was quoted half the price of the dealership. A few days later I showed up and they pulled up my quote and had me in and out of their in less than 10 min. Really friendly staff and half the price of the dealership. Fob/key works as good as the original.<//review><date>1563242081425</date>< userid>

They came to my car within four hours of the call, and cut a key for my car, which is an obscure older car and I thought they were going to have trouble getting it done. They took about 30 minutes and had two sets of perfect keys ready for me and the cost was about a third of what I thought it was going to be. If you’re needing any help with keys these guys are who you should call.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
It  was 130am i was all the way in Vegas and my girlfriend locked her keys in the garage and couldn't get into the house (in San Diego). After thinking of everything we could possibly go we googled "lock smith in San Diego". Other companies didn't answer but this company did. He got there very quickly and did a very good job.
We were very thankful she didn't have to wait in the cold until the apartment office opened< /Review>

After 9 years I apparently "lost" my car keys for my 89 Nissan... Well it was a cold rainy day and after calling multiple "24 hour" companies and being told "it's too dark" or "wait for the weather to clear up", I called the key crew. They came immediately, made a key on the spot very fast, and did an amazing job.  10/10 would recommend over any "24 hour mobile" locksmith in San Diego.< /text>

Tim and Michael helped me out tremendously after someone broke into my vehicle and destroyed my ignition. Tim troubleshot the new ignition I bought, and re-keyed it very quickly. And their friendly attitude was exactly what I needed after all the stress of the break-in. I was recommended The Key Crew by AAA.</Review>

I called EVERY lock smith in SD and these guys not only knew what I was looking for, but we're extremely confident in their ability to fix it. I would recommend them to anyone.

Do not use for residential! Worst experience with any business ever! Instead of fixing the lock correctly the first time I had to have multiple techs come out and was even told by someone  that “ I must have gotten the new guy” !? Not to mention getting locked inside my house! After three techs trying to fix the problem I finally got to talk to a supervisor who told me it would cost me an extra $200 to fix what I asked them to do the first time!</review>

{'time': 1567536557544, 'text': 'Shavonne, you called us out to make a key for a lever lock that ultimately required drilling, not to replace any hardware. Because you are moving, you opted for the least expensive option, and we replaced the cylinder at no additional charge. Admittedly, we should have quoted to change all of the hardware from the beginning. We also sent 2 other techs when you were "locked in" which was really from your having stuffed paper into the latch hole. The quote for $198.49 still stands to replace the hardware. You will need to call to reactivate the service.'}</Response>

<text>I came to this shop twice . There was only one person there who was very nice but became overwhelmed with customers. What made me so upset was my situation was difficult they could not program my car key. When  the owner TIM was called he seemed to not be concerned or consider that I had made 2 trips here only to get interrupted service. Instead of sending help for this guy he just allow my service to suffer. My rating is poor customer service. I came all the way from Temecula because of a referral what a disappointment.</text>< Pics>

As we've all experienced at some point, my key would't turn over the ignition in my car.. VERY Frustrating. I called AAA (TripleA), and they dispatched the Key Crew for the repair.  Nate was the specialist who showed up and he did a great job!  Very friendly and professional.  Really appreciated them and got the car back up and running again.  Thanks!< /Text>

<Text>I went to ACE hardware's locksmith for a very difficult job--merging my car's new ignition key with the old door key.  Ace told me it was against policy
I went to a local locksmith.  They told me it was impossible.
The key crew did it in 10 minutes.  These guys know what they're doing.  They're professionals.  5/5, 100% two thumbs up.  All superlatives.  Go nowhere else.</Text><UserId.>111426771002262587722</UserId.>< name>

Ok i admit it. I made a mistake. Went surfing and had the Toyota key in a waterproof pouch in the pocket of my baggies. The wave action was considerable and guess what? The waterproof pouch and the key somehow floated out! Little chance of finding the items.  A passerby was kind enough to lend me his cel phone. I called AAA. They called The Key Crew. Chris showed up. Talk about professional and experienced. I was amazed by the complexity of the job to create and program an entirely new key. Chris did it like drinking water. Easily. Worth every dollar. Would not hesitate to recommend Chris and the Key Crew again.< /review>

<Review>HANDS DOWN the best locksmith in San Diego! I had locked the keys to my BMW 128 in the trunk. Not only did they unlock the cab of the car in about 20 seconds they had my trunk open in 2 minutes!!! Another locksmith told me their guy would have to take out my rear seat!  (Cost $400) Instead I paid $00 (thanks to AAA). These guys contract with AAA and it’s easy to see why

I COULD NOT BE MORE IMPRESSED!!</Review>< pics>

< Review>
This is by far the most professional and friendly locksmith business I have every patronized! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
When I had initially called in to see if they were able to cut an automotive key for my honda, Ruben was incredibly polite and patient on the phone and in person. Being a sceptical after several calls to other businesses, I am sure I sounded exhausted and defeated. I had called three other places explaining my situation and all other competitors audibly laughed and said no.
When I arrived at their brick and mortar, I was pleasantly surprised to see a professional and well stocked interior and was greeted immediately!
I mentioned that I had just called about my honda key, and Ruben immediately took the initiative to offer relocating the rfid transponder the the new casing at no additional charge. Talk about going above and beyond! When I had mentioned that the battery may also be depleted in the remote, he voiced that he absolutely had the replacement in stock! The frugal natured person that I am was shocked when the replacement battery was priced exactly what I'd pay on amazon for it, and they even replaced the old one.
All in all, I was amazed at the quality of service I received, and will be returning for all of my replacement key needs!
Thank you Team!<//Review>

Locked myself out of my condo late at night and after calling some 1-800 after hours dispatch service and not getting a quick enough response, I spoke with Nate and he was able to give me a fair quote and got me taken care of in a timely manner.  Will definitely recommend the Key Crew!</Review>

Do not come here.
Overpriced and they rob you of your money.
Everything they do is extra.
If you do decide to come here expect to be swindled.<//text>

Got a new car key made today. NOT for the $300 I was quoted by AAA, After I used my premier benefits, but for much much less. They replaced the plastic casing, transferred the transponder and made me a new key using a laser, for $38 with a $2 discount for using my AAA card!!!! Their prices are extremely competitive..I adore Daniel and Michael of The Key Crew!!! Straight up Professionals....<//text>

< Review>
Disappointed.  I called up to get a quote for duplicating my plain metal car key.  No chip or anything.  The lady on the phone was very nice and looked up my car to see if they could handle it.  They could, but the key is a "security key" and requires special skills to cut and costs more as a result.  More than the dealership!  I smelled a scam and took my business elsewhere.  An Irish sounding place to the Southwest of this place did the job in 2 minutes for %10 the price.  Trust and honesty are essential parts of good business and I would think this definitely applies to the lock business as well.  Take you work across town for fair treatment.</Review>

I was worried because a few years ago I had to have a different locksmith let me in and they shattered my car window in the process after a very long struggle.

John showed up to my place in less than 20 minutes and was able to open my door in less than 10 minutes. I can’t say enough about the service and how John was willing to help me on Christmas Eve at 1030 at night. Thanks John!!</text><date>1514185077748<//date></record>

Went to their location to have a key made for my Chrysler (which requires registering the key within the vehicles computer system) - the staff was super friendly and the process was quick and painless (about 20 minutes - mostly to program the key into the car). I would highly recommend as many car keys these days look simple but really are not.</Text>

<user_name>Jael Cervantes< /user_name><review>Took a key to be duplicated and they messed it up. The guy at the counter was nice and all but after he messed it up he said something about the effect that it was my fault. I handed them one branded key and one "generic" key that were obviously NOT identical. He only noticed and said something after he had already started making the cuts but blamed me for not informing them that they weren't the same style keys. It's upsetting because my dealer offered me a free blank which was ruined but now i have to special order one at $50 which is really inconvenient. To top it off I was blamed for their mistake, how is it my fault that they lined up the keys incorrectly? I'm not a key cutter or a key expert. I needed keys to be duplicated and that's it. I'm pretty sure it was an honest mistake but as a business taking responsibility for you mistakes is important.<//review><UserId.>106541682566595719287</UserId.>< Rate>

Their stock is plentiful and the quality of their products is top notch

I have gotten keys made at my other favorite location but when I had a key done here big difference in product quality

Also they can program a brand new key that you otherwise can't do unless you go through the dealer and their rates are half that of dealer programing

Yes they have key blanks however if you get a key made at the dealer and make certain that its made right these guys can program the key and get you out the door faster than going through the dealership

Over all very satisfied

<text>We were looking for a local Baker and decided to give Lil bear bakery a try.  Well it is in an unfortunate location, the service was excellent. They were very interested and willing to help us get the perfect cake. And boy did they deliver! The cake was beautiful and tasted great.

We've actually gone here for another set of cakes and again, great service the cakes are awesome and exactly what we ordered.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-szWGDb5By3PE7k5IYGPvPHXrqUHjQeSYvwin=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcb0c50f16e4b3:0xd97b593f2f5286e5</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Lindmair exceeded expectations. I gave very simple instructions and they delivered, which shows that he knows his business and what the customer wants. From the flavor to the design, it was exactly what I wanted. Definitely coming back. Not to mention, the owner is such a humble and nice person.< /review>< pictures>

They even added purple figs in the middle, but what really sold my family and I was their crust - very unique and just phenomenal! Will be ordering this again for future birthdays!

I highly recommend Lindmair Bakery.</review>

Second time ordering a cake from this place! The owner and staff are so friendly and professional. Placed an order last minute and they were able to go through with it versus the other places that required a 2 week notice in advance. The cake was delicious and on top of that, the prices were amazingly affordable! Definitely coming back!</text>

< review>
This place did my first birthday cake back in 1979 and still the best cake in the inland empire. The cake is fluffy and moist (all four layers👍👍) The Buttercream icing is not too thick nor too sweet but fluffy and perfect, as is his craftsmanship. Thank you Lindmair. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</review>

<review>Absolutely Amazing, Quick, Quality, Superior Knowledge, Extra Nice! It was my Parent's 50th Wedding Anniversary. When they were married, they saved the top of the cake for their 1st Anniversary, but it was Horrible. They couldn't even Eat a bite. So their "Must Have Gift" had to be the top to their cake 50 years later. My Great Grandma made the original cake. When I  gave them the Lindmair Wedding Anniversary cake they were So Excited. Imagine having to wait 50 years to finally "have their cake and eat it too!" :) It was truly the Best Gift EVER. Marble cake with chocolate mousse filling and the most beautiful and tasty butter frosting. Thank you So Much, Lindmair Bakery. You made the day. They actually cut the cake with their original cake knife from 50 years ago! So Very Blessed and Beautiful and Over the Top "WOW YUMMY"!<//review><resp>None</resp>< Date>

<text>I love using this bakery, ever since I found them 3 years ago they are my go to option. Family owned business, father and son team, that does amazing work with icing (no fondant). Every cake I've ordered had been very creative and they have never disappointed. Not only is the cake beautiful but also delicious. Here is the Super Mario cake I ordered last week for my son's birthday. Definitely give them a try!</text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMM-fYDw4Zc2GRsMuRQ3Zk7ZWK1fJhNiPqIdpZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaOg7Nudd4z37egTLVl79Yx_9Z7EZ5JvdEMMzr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIOqUo5yZCSx1XvbRND61A_nad3yDWtFH2vuIN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkYZEAad8Ul1iCbZuqSg1bpXDlodkh6Rb2VRsb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><user>116284586075451737159<//user>< rating>

Such  an amazing Bakery! We ordered a cake for our wedding reception and brought in a picture from online and they matched it 100%! The most beautiful cake and so delicious. The owners were kind and helpful and the price was incredibibly reasonable. We plan to use this bakery for all our cake needs in the future. The store is small and easy to miss when driving  but their work was top notch!<//Text>

Love this little family owned bakery. We have been going here for 5 years, since we found them for our wedding cake. The only bakery we use for all our events wedding, birthday, gender reveal, baby shower etc... We even saved the top of our wedding cake for our 1 year anniversary and when we ate it on our anniversary it was still delicious and moist. They are So great we have at least 4 other family members that will drive all the way from various locations they live just to get cakes from here for their events. You can definitely feel the love they put in their cakes and cupcakes.< /Text>

They did the cake for my son's Baptism and it was absolutely delicious! Cake was gone way before the end of the night. That's a big deal since normally we always have cake left over. Not this time. They don't do fondant BUT definitely are able to work their artistic cake magic on the cakes. I got strawberry with cream cheese filling and chocolate with fresh strawberries. Highly recommend them.<//Text>

I looked everywhere for a good cake with a picture printed on it, and I found this little place tucked away in a corner I'd never expect to find a cake place and I was certainly not disappointed. The owner has been making cakes since he was 17 I believe and he's great at it. You're getting not only an amazing looking cake here, you're also getting a delicious delicacy. The cake is moist and the filling is just the right amount, oh yea did I mention you get a filling of your choosing? Yea you're getting the best bang for your buck here.< /review>

<user_name>Mary Alexander</user_name><Text>I can confidently say that I have almost tasted all of Lindmair Bakery. What I love about her cakes is how fresh and tasty they are. The cream that she uses is very light and NOT TOO SWEET. Which is exactly what I look for in a cake. Lindmair Bakery has done both my bridal shower and wedding cakes. Besides the quality of her cakes she is a great at listening, brainstorming on ideas, and  executing them.  She is also very positive and delightful to work with. I will definitely recommend her for your events.</Text>< UserId.>

Cakes for special occasions are whimsical and fun, but too much frosting and extremely sweet. The carrot cake is delicious, but somewhat lost is the frosting. I prefer tangy frosting.</text>

<review>I ordered a custom cake design via email & sharing a picture from Pinterest of what I wanted. I explained what I wanted and the decorator asked a few questions and we agreed on how best for the idea to come together. I'd never ordered a custom cake before, but Lindmair made it an easy experience. The cake looked great and tastes even better. I'd definitely recommend this bakery to anyone in the area.<//review>< pictures>

I have gotten 3 cakes from here and I was completely satisfied..my first being a regular pink frosting with strawberry cake with pineapple fruit filling..next it was a carrot cake..and the 3rd was so delicious I blacked out..I just don't remember right now but I gave that one to my father in law for his birthday and all I know is that they loved it..really good and great prices..the plaza they are in is a bit questionable and the inside of the store can use a small touch up..but the cakes..are great!<//review>

This bakery makes the best whipped cream cakes and I've tried their butter cream and it is equally as delicious.  I would rather have a great tasting cake then those gum paste monstrosity that taste like junk.. cakes here are always moist and butter cream is just the right amount of sweetness if your looking for a good cake that everyone will compliment then this is the place!<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Ordered a plain white flat sheet cake with pink polka dots for a baby shower. I was very dissapoonted with the way it looked. Although, it was plain,  it looked very cheaply made. Did not look like I bought from a bakery and was professionally done. The very small baby shower pin they added to the cake was a very old, dirty, dusty pin that looked like it had been sitting in a dusty box in someone's attic for years. The "it's a girl" writing was on placed on the upper left corner with very sloppy writing and could hardly be seen with how big the cake was. Customer service was very poor. I still had to go out to buy things to make that cake presentable. To top it off the cake was not good. Bread was not moist and frosting was very, very sweet. Too sweet. I will NEVER order from this place again. I've had better experiences and enjoyed better cakes at a local market or Costco.< /Text><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>1<//Rating>< Name>

Cake was amazingly good.
We ordered our wedding cake from here, and they worked with us to design something truly memorable. Cake was setup and delivered on time, and looked fantastic. We froze the top tier for our 1 year anniversery, and after letting it thaw for a few days in the fridge (in a Tupperware style container) it came out just as moist as our wedding day. Their baked good are always a treat, and even though we now live over an hour away, we still stop by once and awhile.< /Review>

Amanda Winter is very thorough and extremely knowledgeable about the refinancing process. She provided sound advice to get us the best rate and closing costs for our situation.  It was a quick and smooth process.  Amanda is a valuable asset to Finance of America Mortgage! I would highly recommend Amanda to anyone who is either refinancing or purchasing a new home.</Text>

This is our second transaction with Rusty, and all went smooth and easy.  I love how he communicates in advance on what to expect and throughout the process - he had my questions answered before I had a chance to ask them! Thank you, Rusty!<//text>

Great service, everyone on Stacey's team made sure to stay in contact with us every week and updated us every step of the way. I would text them my random questions that would pop up and they got back to me instantly, every single time. We will definitely be using Finance of America for our second home! :)< /review>

<text>We just closed on a refinance and John Ussery made the entire experience easy. He kept us updated throughout the process, and he responded to every email almost immediately. John was the broker on our original loan and we did not hesitate to contact him again when it was time to refinance. He is a great communicator and I highly recommend working with him.</text>< user_name>

When my previous lender was dragging their feet and not available on the weekend to help facilitate an offer on a home I was referred to Erik Petersen and within 15 minutes of speaking to him he had my offer letter ready to go and called the seller's agent to assure her we were good to go. We closed in 3 weeks with a VA loan and had absolutely no hiccups on the way. Erik replied to my texts an emails right away and answered all my questions accurately and promptly. Erik exceeded all expectations!<//text>

I need more 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 🌟 for this John Ussery fella....and more thumbs if I keep reviewing him on phone! 4th transaction with John and he never disappoints! New home buyer ignorance and intimidation? He nailed it. First refi? Refi for my 90yr old parents? 2nd refi? He was patient and kind and informative and knowledgeable and efficient each and every time. He gives me the information and helps me make informed decisions. I trusted him with my parents and will continue to refer him to everyone I know!! He will always be our "lender guy". Thanks John - for going above and beyond and giving every interaction the personal touch!! You're the G.O.A.T.!<//Review>

I've done business with Lyle Innocent four times now, between home purchases and refinancing. He is honest and more experienced and knowledgeable than anyone I've met in the industry. I feel that he treats my money as if it were his own, steering me away from poor, costly decisions, even when they could benefit him. Anyone who looks out for my best interest before his own in the business world has earned my respect, trust and repeat business.<//review>

Inna with Finance of America Mortgage was absolutely phenomenal, she made this process smooth and easy. She was very communicative and understanding. She helped us jump through so many hoops and over so many hurdles. I was just blown away by the level of service we received! Hands down the only person I would recommend. Without her this wouldn’t be possible!</text>

<review>John Ussery sets the bar high for all other mortgage advisors to try and climb over. Most can only wish to be as exceptional as he is. He is a genuine professional who has a strong knowledge of the lending marketplace at any given time. He is a good communicator and he works hard, day in and day out -- all the way to the finish line, and it shows. It is a pleasure to have John Ussery involved in any of my real estate transactions.< /review>< GmapID>

<review>I've worked with Shannon twice now - first for my original home loan, and then for my re-fi. Her customer service is EXCELLENT and UNBEATABLE. She usually answers my phone calls (once even when she was vacation overseas), and if she doesn't answer, she calls back and/or responds within hours.  I really liked the weekly automated emails that let me know exactly where I am in the loan process, and documentation needed. HIGHLY RECOMMEND her and her awesome team!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Worked with Erica Leonard as our Mortgage Advisor for the purchase of our first home and completely lucked out. Erica clearly communicated and did a great job at keeping things as simple as they needed to be to ensure we knew what was going on. There was never a point where my wife and I didn’t know where things were at or what the next steps would be. If any additional documentation was needed, Erica let us know immediately. 10/10 would recommend Erica.</Text>< pics>

I worked with Michelle at Finance of America Mortgage and all I can say is that Michelle was able to help me become a first time home buyer even with my chapter 13. The process took a little longer because of my chapter 13 but at the end it was worth it. I highly recommend the services of Michelle at finance of america mortgage.</Review>

<Name>Dream Catcher</Name><Time>1551243732688</Time><rating>1< /rating><Review>I was closing out my loan and I had to close later than schedule because of my wire transfer not coming in on time as of 02/01/2019.  So, I was already stressed out.  On 02/04/2019, I receive a phone call from Heather Peralta stating that I never submitted docs for the bank that I was trying to pull my funds from.  However, I submitted the bank account activity in 12/2018.  Heather admitted in her e-mail that she assumed that I was going to use my Chase account because I had enough funds.  But, the thing is I had more funds in my other account.  So, now, I had to drop everything to close on 02/04/2019.  I was faxing documents to Heather like crazy, even into my lunch break!  Heather didn't even know that I had two accounts from the bank that I was trying to pull my funds.  One account was closed.  She didn't even know that and was asking for statement on the closed account when there was another account that was opened.  I had to tell her that!  She just asked for all the documents even the ones that I already submitted.  When I told her that I already submitted that she responded in her e-mail, "Okay, maybe we don't need that."  She was asking for documents that I submitted in 03/2018 and 09/2018 in 12/2018!  It was terrible working with her!
So, I contacted the cooperate office and Kathy Semon responded.  She said she was going to do an investigation.  She e-mailed me saying that she was concluding that I closed on 02/04/2019 because my wire transfer did not come in on time.   However, I did not make a statement that I closed on 02/04/2019 because of Heather.  I was talking about Heather being unorganized that she caused me more unnecessary stress.  Secondly, granted that my wire transfer came in late, however, had I not dropped everything and jump on it to fax everything over to Heather, I would not have been able to close even on 02/04/2019.  Lastly, why does my wire transfer coming in late have anything to do with Heather not being on top of her job and asking for documents that I submitted nine months ago?  I believe had Semon done her investigation properly, she should have known that Heather only received the docs on 02/04/2019 which continued into my lunch break.  How does Heather not being able to provide proper customer service because she was not on top of her job have anything to do with my wire transfer not coming in on time?  I would never want to work with Fiance of America Mortgage again.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x809b1fe93b598503:0xc08f7bce1d1db1db<//Gmap_id></record>

This is a very good fast casual Mexican place for breakfast lunch dinner in Mountain View.  The Mountain View special burrito is my favorite its tasty fresh juicy rich and decent price. They have good tacos and a breakfast menu. Plus good Mexican refreshment drinks like Horchata and Rose drink. You will pay few bucks more on average than Taco Bell but you will get consistently better Mexican food. In the COVID time they are operating solid take out service with quick order completion. It's been a Best of Mountain View award winner for many years! Its kind of a hidden gem in a small strip mall.<//text>

The fastest burrito place ever. Faster then McDonald’s and Taco Bell combined. I turned around and my burrito was ready. Less than 60 seconds< /review>

We went here to celebrate an occasion, and were in the mood for Mexican. The food was quite average, especially for the prices charged. Everything was ok. Service was good, drinks were good. For reference we had the tacos, the jalapeno potatoes (very bland, no kick) and the seafood crepe(?) dish (it was ok).</text>

<text>This is a very nice place - I like their burritos. It's hidden gem, probably you won't even notice it when you drive by. If you like burrito, then definitely give it a try - they won't disappoint.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Had a burrito for lunch receny at this place and enjoyed it. The flavors were great, enjoyed the quality and freshness of everything, especially the salsas. The carne asada could have been a bit more tender, unfortunately it was a bit chewy. Good prices, fast and friendly service.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808fb73df5dbdad3:0x977decc5fec0afad< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My favorite place for burritos. The atmosphere in the store isn't much, but the burritos are the best around, and at a good price. They are certainly better than any of the big chains. Part of what makes them so good, is the choice of size (chico, regular, and super), beans (refried, pinto, and black), rice (spanish, brown, and white),  and salsa (mild, medium, and hot).</Text>

The burrito range goes from regular to huge and everything in between. They will customize your order and offer daily specials. This is my go to burrito place. Lots of choices and has been at the same location for years. They have lots of dishes on the menu but I'm hooked on their fresh, juicy and delicious burritos<//text>

The best burritos in the South Bay. Huge variety of traditional meats, salsas, and sauces. You can go mild or spicy and the burrito flavors still shine through. It may look small on the outside but this is a local hot spot and very popular with many folks in the area. Definitely worth a stop if you love a great burrito!< /text>

I'm lucky to have moved in right around the corner from the area's best burrito place! I recommend the Pollo en mole. They stew it fresh every day. One day I arrived right when they opened, and they had to ask back to the guy stirring this huge pot if it was ready yet. You may have to wait until it's properly lunch time for this treat!

La Costeña has been a great resource when we invite a number of friends over for a game day. We can all walk down there and everyone can have a nice custom made meal.

A lot of people get takeout here, and they keep the line moving quickly. If you want to sit (indoors, outdoors, or at their large community table), there is always plenty of room.

They are generous with their portions. They are precise with making everything as ordered.

They have vegetarian and vegan options. Ask them to customize any way you need. Since they make everything fresh they are knowledgeable about all the ingredients. It may not be a good pick, though, for those with highly sensitive allergies, as they can't guarantee there won't be cross-contamination from the assembly-line style of preparation.< /text>

It is okay. Their food is very mild and they have no signs of Salsas or condiments. To me the sign of a great Mexican Taqueria is a kind of like a condiment and salsa bar that you can put the proper amount of heat on. This one doesn't have that. The food is very simple and Mild. It is still good. But you really have to ask for the hot stuff because they do not put it on and they do not even ask you how hot you want it<//Review>

No wonder this plain-looking place win "Best of Mountain View" year after year.  Wait is usually short, although we do not really go there at peak hour.  Dining area is limited, and furniture is very minimal.  But I give five stars for the price/cost ratio: they are also very inexpensive.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>I have been going to La Costeña for years. When it was in the back of a Mexican market.  The burritos are excellent.  I highly recommend the mole.  It is not a typical, heavy chocolate mole.  It is more o a lighter brown color.  The taste is phenomenal. Their carne azada is on point too!  Their nachos, tacos and quesadillas are also great!  Staff is very friendly too.  I highly recommend this place!</review><rate>5</rate><gmapID>0x808fb73df5dbdad3:0x977decc5fec0afad</gmapID><resp>None<//resp><name>Neil</name>< pics>

The food here was not bad but a bit on the mild side. I did not try the meat options (pescatarian) but the vegetable options left me quite disappointed.< /Review>

The last time I've been here was when I was living in Mountain View. The service was good, and the food was, okay, a bit more salty than  usual.. But still good.. I think next time I'll just get a burrito instead of a plate. Overall, I give this a four star because of the food being a bit salty. Service was satisfactory.<//review>

<Review>Very accessible place for burritos, also close to Sunnyvale if you are working there. Unfortunately I did not take any pictures. Useful if you want a tasty burrito to go. You can certainly sit down and there is space yet it is not formal at all so be aware of that. Score is mostly for the surroundings, food is good.<//Review>< time>

This place is just a pale facsimile of it's former self when it was located on Middlefield Rd. I ordered the vegetarian burrito and the wife had chicken enchiladas. Both were pricey compared to other places we've been to and the guy behind the counter seemed completely indifferent to helping us. It took @ 10 minutes for the food to arrive and it was look warm. Had the food warmed, but it was fairly mediocre at best. Don't know why these guy's keep winning these best of Mountain View awards. There's nothing anymore about them that they deserve to win, and there's much better places locally.</Review>

Good variety of chicken options, but overly dry tacos and meh quesadilla 😒 It didn't help that there was no salsa provided, despite assurances that it was included in the plates.</Review>

Can see how some people can think it is less than friendly but I thought the service was quick and efficient. Just don't expect conversation they are trying to get good food out quickly... good enough for me.  👍< /text>< Pics>

This was the first e-commerce site, when Sun engineers set up a fax+ xwindows tool(xburrito) to order from your desktop in the early 1980s. It was a grocery store then where you could order your custom burrito by pointing to what you wanted. Then Run by an old husband and wife team. Now the store has moved to a new location, and the ordering process has changed. The burrito is still good, but you can no longer ask for exactly what you want. The large one can still feed a family of four. Still one of the better burrito in town<//review>

<Review>Excellent burritos. The place holds the World Record for largest burrito ever made. What they don't tell you is their food is pretty damned good too. There are some places I like a little better... But La Costena is on my regular rotation of taco a burrito places... And it should be for you as well!<//Review>< response>

Favorite taqueria in Mountain View. It's still not as good as the old location was (and I really miss the Subway-style ordering process, as they do mess up orders regularly), but the Pollo en molo with fire salsa is still my favorite burrito.</Review>

Great handmade burritos made to order. It felt more customizable when they were at the old location but the place is still good. Same cashier guy as the old place so this appears to be a family business.  They have daily specials which is 4.99 for a regular burrito (any meat) which includes a can soda.  People mostly go for the mt.view special ( your choice of meat) burrito and it is always made well and fast. This is my go to place for burritos in the area.< /review>

The burrito place hidden in the back of this Mexican convenience store isn't readily discoverable, but all the locals know about it and treasure it! The burritos are large and delicious, and there are a generous selection of ingredients. However, they don't offer seating, so be prepared to bring your food somewhere else.</text>

<text>Excellent burritos. The place holds the World Record for largest burrito ever made. What they don't tell you is their food is pretty damned good too. There are some places I like a little better... But La Costena is on my regular rotation of taco a burrito places... And it should be for you as well!< /text>< user_name>

The best burritos in Mountain View. They have a big menu — eight or nine different kinds of meat, plus lots of other fillings. It's no longer a burrito bar, where you walk down the line and pick out the ingredients you want — you have to pick them all from the menu. But it still tastes just as good.<//review>

<text>i find it quite telling that every bad review I've seen for them is full of poor grammar and atrocious spelling. this place is still as great as it was when it was back on old middlefield. i'm only sad that people can't have the same pick what you want as you walk along the ingredients experience. you can get their burritos however you want them, so if you don't like them, it's definitely on you! just wish it was in a more convenient location so i don't keep forgetting it's there!< /text>< Rate>

Best burrito place around.  Became a fan in their old location. New location is better with seating and ordering counter. Love the chicken mole or chicken adobado.  Generous sizes. Go with the special that includes all the extras.</review>

<text>Great price, delicious burritos!
Many options of meat, salsa, beans to choose from.

You can choose between three different sizes, which is great because some other stores *coughChipotlecough* have such big burritos you feel kind of sick after eating it.</text>< pics>

<Text>one of the best burritos in the South Bay. it's tied with another taqueria for my #1 spot. highly recommended.

just be aware of what you're ordering. I think their "super" burrito relates to the size of the burrito rather than the ingredients.< /Text>< pictures>

<review>This has been one of my favorite burrito places since I moved to the Bay area and loves in mountain view. I used to go to it's old location on rengsdorf I believe but stopped after moving to San Francisco. I was really happy to learn that they moved to the same shopping center as my dentist who I continue to go to for toothwork. It's great, I get do enjoy a burrito with a numb mouth every once in a while.<//review>< user_name>

< Review>
After all these years and a location change, La Costena still boasts the best burrito in the South Bay and one of the best in the Bay Area. When it comes to burritos, the attention to detail, the quality of each ingredient, and importantly, the balance between ingredients, are second to none. La Costena offers an exquisite variety of tasty meat options and plenty of fresh ingredients. Don't be afraid to customize your burrito and order exactly what you want! My go-to is a regular carne asada burrito with refried beans, Spanish rice, "both kinds of cheeses," sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo, and hot salsa roja. Yum! Diced jalapeños or their "hot pico" option are fine additions if you want something spicy! Note that "regular" and "super" refer to the size of the burrito, not the ingredients.</Review>

Consistently good over 25 years and 2 locations. Have always appreciated some of the ingredient types like the adobado and encebollado are fresh grilled for your order and at a great price point.< /Review>

this is probably the best burritos outside of nacho mamas in garberville. the burrito bar has about 40 topics to pick from. this burrito place got into the guiness book for largest burrito. i don't think the other google reviewers shared this useful information in their scope. do they? i like this burrito place a lot< /text>

Decent burritos, and they are open late, which is nice. Huge portions for cheap. It is a joint to go burrito place and little grocery store. Could be convenient, I guess?< /Review>

Don't let appearances fool you. Walk into the very sparse Mexican grocery on the corner of Middlefield and Rengstorff. In the back, you will find the source of the best burittos in the area.

La Costena is a small place dedicated to burritos. They have a large selection of proteins and other ingredients like veggies and cheeses. You choose all your ingredients as you go and watch them make it right in front of you.

They offer different sizes of burritos. Be careful when ordering the super burrito. It is actually a gigantic burrito made from two tortillas. They also offer a special every that includes a free canned drink.

They do have seating outside, which isn't bad on most evenings in Mountain View.</Text>

I loved this place, in their old location. It seems as through they refuse to listen to order preferences at their new location...I only ask that they cut up the steak well and pit lots of rice. I'll pay for extra rice or I'll cut the steak more but alas I go elsewhere now, sadly.< /text>

Best burritos in Mountain View! This place has a huge variety of toppings, all delicious. My favorite part, though, is the "chico" burrito. For anyone who's struggled to finish an amazing burrito that's half again too big, the chico is for you!< /Review>

SUPER BURRITO????? I have been to many different places where they have a "super burrito" and from what I've notice is that it's called "super" because they add more "prime" ingredients not just for the size. I order a so called " super burrito" and for the $13 I paid I was expecting much more then what I got. And what I got is not even worth $5. My "super burrito" had beans, rice, salsa Verde, and just SOME carne asada, and I said some because it was only like a soup spoon of meat in the middle. Very disappointed. Not worth the money I spent.<//Review>

I had the Mountain View special with pollo barracho. It was decent. Easily better than Qdoba and chipotle  but overall it left me wanting a good old fashion SF burrito. Unfortunately the trek is still necessary.<//Review>

[From August 2008]

I ordered an enchilada platter today and was pretty darn pleased.

PORTION: Large, but not humongous.  That's fine :)
BEANS (whole): Cooked nicely, decent scoop, a bit watery, though (lady was too impatient to let it drain).
SALSA (mild): Don't really taste it in the mix.  To their credit, they have a selection of salsas.
GUAC: Really tasty!  Seems decently fresh.
MEAT (chicken mole):  Cooked perfectly (tender, not dry).  Nicely seasoned, but nothing amazing.
ENCHILADA:  Grilled with cheese on it, not microwaved!  This may seem like a no-duh idea, but I've been bummed at how many Mexican places just nuke their enchiladas!
CHIPS:  None offered.  Hey, that sucks :-(
COST:  Not too bad, but charging for everything extra is annoying.
DRINK:  Maybe I missed it, but no horchata and such?  WTH?
SERVICE:  Okay.  Woman wasn't particularly friendly.
PARKING:  Yeah, it generally sucks, but there were two open spaces on this Sunday afternoon.

People rave about La Bamba compared to this?!  You can see my review of that place, but in a nutshell, why?!?  La Bamba offered practically no customization (not even choices of salsa?!?), and their burrito tasted more like a quesadilla to me... way too much cheese.  Yuck.< /text>
