<rating>5<//rating><review>Manny was amazing to work with!! From the first call he was very attentive in getting us what we needed! Working Capital! Communication was great and everything was done in a timely manner. Total processing time was 3 days and we had the funds needed to handle a glitch in business. Not a scam and recommended if you are new and growing business and looking for a good way to gain business credit. Manny Venegas is highly recommended!</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Responded to  Preapproved letter. Applied for the loan, uploaded all the documents sounds like a deal, got the phone call from representative, went through all verifications and answer all the questions after that no communication for two weeks, no response to phone calls or emails., now I don’t even think it’s a legit company and I don’t even know who I provided my bank statements too and all my information. Have to freeze my credit now because I feel that my info went to ????
If it’s a real business, not a good business and definitely really bad communication in customer service.< /Review><rating>1< /rating><UserId.>114074008016954834650</UserId.>< resp>

Keith made this transaction quick and easy. I am very very busy as most small business owners are and Keith was not pushy and answered all the questions I had. He has also allowed me the opportunity to build credit for my company as I am fairly new and it is not easy getting loans this early. Highly recommend Quickbridge and be sure to ask for Keith, to any new company looking for a little push.</text>

<Review>I went through the application process and got a call from Jacob to submit my bank statements for March April and May. I did that and he said it wouldn't the information he was needing claiming all he had was transaction history. So I had to go through the trouble to have a work order put in which cost $3.00 per month and took several days to get in and I submitted them to Jacob. He was going to be out of the office so he gave me another associates phone number and I contacted him. Same story it was not enough information.  I texted him back and let him know thats all the information bank statements have. Jacob should have the transaction part of the statements I sent in last week.  So I  got ghosted. Ive applied for small loans  over the year and I've never been through anything as ridiculous as this situation was. If they can't manage their business and treat the customers any better than what I've been through I would run from these guys</Review><gmapID>0x14e177e66ec01f79:0x11d08fd54eebed7e<//gmapID>< username>

<Time>1611687516338</Time><text>I was funded a smooth $150,000 from Jarrett and his team over at Quickbridge. This funding helped me secure my inventory for an upcoming PO, hire two more personnel, and throw a bit at marketing. Jarrett was an absolute pleasure to work with. Didn’t BS me and was straight forward about the entire process, more than I could say for other companies that continue to call me.

Thank you Jarrett for getting to know me and my business and finding the right product for me in 2021. I will continue to work with your company and tell my buddies about you too.

Cheers!

I was working with David.  I am a new business owner just started my company about 6 months ago. No one would finance me or give me a loan cause I didn't have my taxes done or proof of income with taxes. He helped me out and got me a loan and worked around my bank statements. The terms are a little tougher then most typical loans but I was in a hard spot. But I would for sure use them again if needed  nice to talk to on the phone and will even help figure out ways to get the problem worked out. Thank you for the help...
P.S
O and I got the mailer they sent to my business address it looks like a credit card almost. I see some people have a problem with this but, when you have a business your information is now public thats how alot of financial business get ahold of you nothing out of the ordinary no need to get freaked out lol.<//text>

Never ever get a loan from these people. no collateral,  haha read the contract: you sign your life away, house all. Keep the faith and grind, do not sign the death contract.

Their Attorney Tara is a power tripping lady/ ....... Sweet then sour!! If you ever get behind this company will screw you. Please keep your business from these loan sharks!!!! I promise you, close your own doors before you get in bed with these people. All they care about are numbers. Leslie and Brian are cool though.

Brandon.

Horrible customer service, contacted lendingtree and they referred me over to Quickbridge funding. I received a phone call immediately from Quickbridge and consistent emails, when I tried returning there call I had no luck getting through. Finally Brandon Booth picked up and said can’t get you funding and hung up quick. Never submitted my bank statements or application. I have excellent credit, and very good bank statements, and my business has been around. False advertising and constant emails for no reason. Go with a traditional SBA loan, these people are rude and treat you like scum. Stay far away!<//Text>

They supposedly helped companies grow? Not during a pandemic when most people can't even keep their business afloat. Then a common issue is people get no quick response when they need help or have issues, but get a "next day" response when it's time to get approved. Seems like you guys are just legal loan sharks.

Ofcourse we all have questions and believe me, Garrett Hall was POLITE AND VERY UNDERSTANDING through it all. QuickBridge Funding, their Associates and their Partner Companies are great. I'll be back in a few months for that MAJOR FUNDING. THANKS fro everything Garrett.
Merry Christmas to you, your family and your Coworkers.

Great Job<//text><Rate>5<//Rate>< user_name>

Quick and easy to do.  The representative, Patrick was great with communication and patient when we had trouble getting a hold of each other during the workday. He seemed to be actively engaged in making sure we had everything we would need before proceeding to the next step.  Funds came when they said they would and there wasn't much of a hold up.< /Review>

<review>When I signed up it was axos bank, then it was national funding taking the money out of the account and then its quickbridge coming after you for the money. they dont care about covid 19 and how business is down, they only care about their money, they charged 33 percent, which is usurious.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Name>

QuickBridge was able to get my business funding when other companies could not. The process was simple, quick & smooth. David Bourne is the person I worked with & he really took the time to listen to our business needs. I will definitely continue using QB as a funding option in the future.<//Text>

We're always treated with respect and receive prompt attention. Leslie our loan manager is always sweet and willing to help, she is always actively engaged in our phone calls and works hard to get us approved within 24 hours. Our loan is always funded quickly and without hassle. Thanks Quickbridge.</review>

Katie Lynch from QuickBridge was amazing from start to finish!!! SHE HAS SOME OF THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IVE EVER SEEN!! She made it seem like I was her only client throughout the process. She gave me confidence that I was going to achieve the loan even when it seemed like I wasn’t going to get the loan. She is extremely personable. QuickBridge will be at an extreme loss if she leaves the company. I strongly recommend QuickBridge and sales rep Katie Lynch.<//review>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>I do NOT recommend Quickbridge unless you want to make a decision you’ll most likely regret. They say they want to start you out with a “bridge” loan. What they do is set you up on small daily repayments auto drafted from your checking account. Here’s the thing, over the entire lifetime of the loan if you EVER let your account drop below how much they draft out daily, they call your full loan due even after the first time saying you are in default. Now here’s their “trick”, if you borrow say $10k, they mark the loan amount up to $14k immediately. So if you want to pay your loan off the very next day the payback is $14k. Now if your account drops below the minimum daily payment and they call your full loan due, they’ve made all their profit quickly because they made you pay it all back before the full term of the loan. Wouldn’t this business model not inspire their loan officers to quickly get these loans in default to make faster profits? I can not believe this company is allowed to operate. Absolutely predatory lending in my book. Note: They haven’t had to call my loan due but I assure you after speaking to them numerous times that definitely seems to be their intention. Do not say you weren’t warned.</Text><Date>1552754479864</Date><user>100885607037509962218< /user><gmapID>0x14e177e66ec01f79:0x11d08fd54eebed7e</gmapID>< rate>

<response>{'time': 1553554614898, 'text': "QuickBridge has no record of ever lending to a person named Michael Strickland or a business associated with that name. This review has been reported to Google for fraud.\n\nWe would like to address a few of the false claims made in this review:\n\n- To start, should a borrower wish to pay back a loan early, we offer an Early Payoff Discount. We are never more pleased than when the funding we offer a business does exactly what it was intended to do: help a business get to the next goal. If that means the business earns enough to pay us back sooner, we welcome that. They are not penalized, they are rewarded. And we'll be ready the next time they need us.\n- In the instance of a missed payment, we do not require immediate payment in full the very next day. Like virtually any lender, there is a 30 day window before anything is reported and we work diligently with businesses to prevent that. We help them through rough patches while they are paying back their loan.\n\nThis attempt to tarnish our good name is reprehensible. QuickBridge prides itself on a simple lending process that is fair and completely transparent from start to finish. We have tens of thousands of customers who agree and have been helped by the working capital we provide. We encourage anyone who has read this far (and thank you if you have!) to see for yourself what we can do to support your business."}</response></record>

I had a previous loan that needed to be paid off in addition to the new loan I got from QB. They made the whole process easy. From app to funding only took about three business days and that's only because I took my time going over the contract. Tyler was my contact at QB. I only dealt with him the entire time. He answered all my questions and was personable. I treat my customers kindly, so I appreciate the same from other companies. I will likely use QB for all my future funding needs due to the excellent service I received.<//review>< pictures>

Owners take heed to this warning !!!!!!! This is a bait and switch lending scam.  Their terms and notices are absolutely lies. Also take note that is if they don’t  like something they can demand note and demand payment and they only do it in the state of California so beware signing docs as it isn’t really clearly noted and they don’t tell you that at all during lending process<//Review>

My honest review and experience with this company. Had I completed this review prior to the COVID19 pandemic I would have given 4 stars. 4 stars for giving an opportunity for a loan, when my company did not have much credit history. 4 star for process, 3-4 star for terms - not great terms, but to be expected with minimal credit history. But I had not missed 1 weekly payment of $660. When the pandemic started to drastically change the day to day business operations, I emailed the company to see about any relief options available. My payments are due weekly, not monthly, so any time spent dragging on has a huge financial impact on my company. So it took several days to get a response what was needed to seek relief. The exact same day I received the email from them, I sent them exactly what they requested. EXACT SAME DAY! 1 week went by (another $660 payment withdrawn), I emailed requesting an update. They responded with "they need the information requested". I responded I sent the information a week prior, but attached it again. Again days went by. No response. So I emailed again checking status. They responded with additional requests for current month to date register adding it needs a daily balance. I would have sent that in original email if they had requested it. I state that, and again send info including their new request on the same exact day. Another payment of $660 withdrawn. Again silence. Again I ask status as I am drowning because at this point businesses in North Carolina have been ordered to close. They act like I haven't sent any information when I ask for an update. It is obvious to me they are purposely putting off any relief effort at this point. I still have missed no payments up to this point and through this painful process. I send the information 7 times over the course of 3 weeks. (That is 3 additional weekly payments of $660 made on time during the request process) Finally am approved for no payments for 2 weeks and 1/2 payments for 2 week. Which is what I requested 3 weeks prior, but at this point our County had issued a declaration that businesses are closed indefinitely until they lift the order(which is still in effect currently). So I immediately replied requesting a total of 4 weeks no payments and 2 weeks of 1/2 payments. Absolute silence with no response. I had already explained to them in the prior process I had 2 bank accounts and was closing the one they were on. That I needed to change my account. They never addressed that. But dont you know when they tried to draft the 1/2 payment 2 weeks later, and couldn't because I had completed my phasing out of that account, they were calling, texting and emailing multiple times in one week for communication. Their contact was consistent and on point. Funny how when I had tried to contact them about assistance during a time of despair, I have no control over, all I got was silence, they didn't recieve the emails, or phone calls or information I had sent 7 times before, but when they need communication they are sending multiple forms of communication within a week, and a letter from an attorney 2 weeks after my first 1/2 payment wasn't received. You should be ashamed! From someone who never missed a weekly payment of $660 asking for relief ahead of time, your mishandling of my request, now my business has been closed for going on 2 months straight under direct declaration orders of my county and state of NC, to you sending a collection letter from an attorney because the 2 weeks of 1/2 payments havent been made (which I requested be the 2 additional weeks of no payments). This closure of my business is totally out of my control, and I tried to be responsible and proactive with your company, but in return I have not gotten the same respect. BUYER BEWARE! Do not use this company. Choose a company that has more respect and compassion for you. I'm not asking for a free handout. Simply asked for assistance during the COVID19 pandemic to put off my weekly $660 payments for 4 weeks and 1/2 payments for 2 weeks.< /text>

Quickbridge Values Profits over People

Our business took a loan with Quickbridge. When COVID-19 hit, we contacted each financial institution that we did business with. All of them gave us at least 4 weeks of relief from payments. Quickbridge gave us 1 week. After that, payments continued. We asked for more time but were told no. Just know that even in a global crisis, Quickbridge will come for your payments. Overdrafting? Laying off workers? Quickbridge wants their money and they will not help you mitigate problems.</text>

The company was OK to deal with, however the interest rate fluctuated within the terms of the loan. I borrowed 12,400 after fees. Read your contract, each month you retain the funds the payback amount increases.
In the end the 15,535.00 30 day repayment mushroomed into 16950.00 I paid 5450.00 to borrow 12,400.00. I paid 45% and they money was taken daily. By the end of 6 months, the entire 12400 was gone from the " daily pull". The next two months was all juice for them. You can do better with a revolving line. It you absolutely must have the money , do what you must, not for the faint hearted.< /text>

{'time': 1563225569039, 'text': 'Thank you for your review and your business Joe. We hope the funding was helpful to your business, and we wish you continued success.\n\nPlease allow us to clarify: QuickBridge offers loan options with a consistent payment throughout the entire loan period (i.e., customers borrow a fixed amount, at a fixed price, for a fixed term, and thus, the loan payment is the same every day/week). Once a funding amount and repayment option are selected, the borrower is provided a detailed, transparent loan agreement that reiterates the terms of the loan, including the repayment schedule and final payoff amount.\n\nThe only variation in a final payoff amount is related to our Early Payoff Discount, which is explained in detail in the loan agreement the borrower signs. Should a customer wish to pay back the loan early, they will receive a discount off the agreed-upon final payoff amount (this offer does not apply when the loan is being paid off by another lender). That Early Payoff Discount decreases as the loan is paid down on a normal schedule. Should the borrower not take advantage of the Early Payoff Discount, their final payoff amount will be exactly what is stated in the loan agreement.'}<//resp>

My experience was very positive with QuickBridge.  Garrett Hall went the extra mile on my account and got me the funding that my business needed and like advertised, I received the funds within 24 hours.  Thank you Garrett.  He clearly deserves a promotion and a substantial increase in salary because Garrett Hall is a financial services Rock Star! :o)< /Review>

<Review>Made the mistake of getting a loan from these people. I knew the interest was high but was assured I could restructure later on after building a relationship and perfect payment history. Instead I was lied to for a couple of different situations. They are all about getting your money on a high interest initial loan and then kick you to the curb and find another sucker to do the same to.< /Review>< Rating>

Loan sharks, this company changed there name before obviously to remove negative reviews. The way things are going it seems they are probably going to have to do it again. The request daily repayment and use intimidation tactics. I would recommend staying away from them.</Review>

It takes two to tango. The loan process was smoothly cooperative by both parties. Pablo Vizcarra let me know what I needed to provide to make the process smooth, and that is exactly what happen. I got funded a few days after the initial connection and I highly recommend QuickBridge - especially if you work with Pablo! For the people that say this is a scam; they probably do not understand how the loan process works; you need to prove cash flow in your bank account; your business needs to be legit; and you need to understand that there are interest involved in paying back the loan! Thank you again Pablo, for working with my business. Will talk soon!< /Text>

I can go all day about this company practice but just to inform people don’t put yourself in this company hand.
This is a broker company which gets funding from some else,  then put 15 to 35 % commissions.

Be careful to read the entire contract at length.  Its not a line of credit, nor is a simple interest loan.  This is something much worse.  Here's how it works:

There is no "truth in lending" statement in their documents that disclose an interest rate, so I don't know how they get away with this, nor do I know how much I'm actually paying.  These loans are completely front-loaded.

I was approved for $x and I told them I didn't need that much, but that is great!  I was excited to be able to start building credit for my business.  I felt like I didn't have much time to make a decision, nor did I have a lot of time to actually read what I was getting in to.  I trusted the adviser on the other end of the phone. Big mistake.

I wanted to be sure that there was no pre-payment penalty, I was told that they actually "offer a discount to pay it off early!"  Not really, if you borrow $X, and want to pay it off within the first 3 months, they payoff is calculated by taking your original amount multiplied by some number (125% in my case) - the payments you made.  So if you borrow $10,000, your loan payoff would be $12500 - 2 payments of $500.  Your payoff would be $11500 for a $10,000 loan, which they already took a 2% origination fee.  Oh, and the best part is the "discount" decreases every 3 months.  So in 6 months, that payoff can be calculated by using a higher number than 125%, probably more like 130%)

After they said we will deposit the money in your account tomorrow, I sat back and did the calculation, by the time the fees are added back in, I will have paid 35% in interest for less than a year!!!  I tried to call them back and stop the deal, but of course no one would return my call to do that.

Fast forward 4 months, when I call my rep he will not return my call.  I want to pay if off, and I have no idea how to do it.

You can do much better with a line of credit.<//text>

Be aware of Quickbridge Funding practice of pulling credit and information based on Rogue Brokers. This practice will harm relationships with potentially good customers and good funding companies. I hope this practice stops soon.< /Review>

I was just had my business loan approved, and funded, today! I don't have the best credit, and my debt-to-income ratio is high, but Quickbridge (and Tyler Seislove) were able to get my loan approved quickly, with minimal effort on my part, and they actually  made it fun (and they never made me feel badly about my credit situation). I HIGHLY recommend Quickbridge AND Tyler Seislove... you can't go wrong!</review>

< Review>
Quickbridge is the absolute definition of a loan shark company. Quickbridge will lend any business funds to operate or to grow there company they have you believe in the idea that they truly care about your company. To know they will receive almost double their investment
in return. They sell you on the idea that after you made several payments that you will be able to restructure the loan to accommodate your business growth. All Quick Bridge employees are under trained and unable to address any issue's or general questions that come with any type of loan taken by a business owner. I high advise the president BEN GOLD  in taking time to train his employees , this will allow his employees to obtain a reputable name for him while he continues to rip off small business. Sandra who state's that she has worked for the company for 20 years seems as though she is unable to make decisions or have the ability to address or resolve any question in a professional manner. Companies like these need to be held to lending standards  and controlled by the government. Please save your company and stay clear of this company they will never stand by what the say.< /Review>
<pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1563226816470, 'text': 'Because QuickBridge is an alternative lender, we are better able to lend to businesses that do not have the well-established financial history required by most traditional banks. Our highly trained and knowledgeable team takes extreme care to understand a business’s unique needs. And we pride ourselves on providing honest, transparent communication to ensure our borrowers understand our loan products.\n\nDuring the application process, various loan amounts and repayment options are presented so that the borrower - as the expert on the business – can determine what makes the most sense for their present needs. Once a funding amount and repayment option are selected, the borrower is provided a detailed, transparent loan agreement that reiterates the terms of the loan, including the repayment schedule. We do not offer or make promise of loan restructuring as part of the loan contract.\n\nWhile we offer guidance to help a business choose a right-size loan, we unfortunately cannot guarantee how the business will perform once it receives the funding. And regardless of performance, borrowers sign an agreement indicating a commitment to repay the loan. While we do our very best to accommodate our customers who face challenges, we do take action - as any other lender would - when the terms of the loan agreement are breached.'}<//Response>< GmapID>

<name>Failing at its Finest</name><Review>Keystone Rampworks LLC has had a terrible time getting loans for our, very out of the box business, a Skatepark and Coffee House.
Garrett Hall was very helpful and willing to work with us on our needs. We have had a great experience with this company so far.
Yes, these companies have higher interest rates, but you need to do your homework and be sure you know what your business needs are what your options are.
If you're unclear on how loans work, ask questions, Garrett got us the answers and explained in full detail all of the information before signing.
They're a great option for business whose owners don't have great credit. Do your homework and understand how this process works.
Ask for Garrett he knows the business and will do his best to answer all your questions.<//Review>< time>

This company blows up my company phones multiple times a day. Obviously trying to make a sale, I looked into them trying to figure out why they sent my company a credit card in the mail as a invitation. I made the mistake of calling them, now I get multiple calls. I've had to change my business number just to stop the calls.</Text>

Thank you everyone for your review. They keep on sending me these damn letters so I finally decided to look them up and check out there reviews.  There are more negatives than positives and there attempts to “address” the “Issues” lack in substance and true  sincerity.  Now, y’all can STOP 🛑 sending me this trash mail.<//Text>

“IM NOT GONNA SIT HERE AND HELP YOU”

My mother waiting patiently and finally helped after calling someone over was told by “Chris” that he “won’t sit here and help her” load her phone from an exchange lemon iPhone XS plus  to a new one because “there are too many people here and I’m not gonna sit here and wait for you. You need to do it yourself”. Vinnie stepped in but the lack of customer basic support from Chris was ridiculous. Put him in the back stocking stuff. He should NOT be on the customer floor.

Update in response to Verizon:  I just ordered a 512 gb iPad Pro 12.9. How about a discount or match the same price for the 1 TB as compensation for a horrible experience?  My email is ready_dave @ yahoo dot com< /text>

I have been a customer of Verizon for better than a decade.  This store has a hit or miss staff.  Sometimes they are helpful and courteous.  Other times they are rude and disinterested.  Not a fan; but I am a captive to the almost universally great wireless service.  Just sayin'.< /text>

Placed a pick up order. Told me itll be ready the next day (today) and got the email saying it was ready. Go to wait a little before opening and guy inside said they're not opening today anymore even though I was told to come pick it up anytime after opening. I get we're in a pandemic but don't tell customers it'll be ready the next day and then not open. Overall terrible service.<//Review>

Worst store ever. My dad took me off his plan so I went into the store to set up my own and get a new phone. From the very start the sales person was rude to me and treated me as a little kid not an adult. He had problems and wasn't able to set it up. He gave me a fake phone number to call that didn't even leave a dial tone or nothing. Please take your money elsewhere this is the worst store ever< /review>

The service here is a disgrace to Verizon. I had to wait over an hour to see an agent!  When two employees were helping the same customer, with at least a dozen other customers waiting, some for over an hour, I suggested to one of the employees that it might be more productive if he were to assist one of the waiting customers rather than double team a single customer. He responded that he is the manager, and he doesn't help clients. What?!? The store is standing room only with people waiting all morning, but you can't help out? That attitude pretty much sums up the level of service at this location.<//text>

<review>This has got to be the WORST Verizon store ever. My wife bought a IPhone XS on the Verizon site and we went to pick it up at this location ( Bad Idea). After waiting twenty minutes to even get noticed, I told the sales guy that we ordered a phone online and we’re here to pick it up. He brought out the phone and preceded to tell us Verizon doesn’t setup phones for customers anymore ( Yeah Right!). He also was trying to tell my wife that Apple recommended not using the lightning cable, but to use the $60 wireless charger. After all this I had enough, and called him out on his BS. I told him I have an IPhone XS Max that I bought from Apple, and they didn’t tell me I had to have the wireless charger, they told me my phone had wireless charging capabilities. I will never go to this store again, and advise anyone looking for a phone to find another store.<//review><rate>2< /rate>< Pics>

<date>1529549373707< /date><Review>This has to be by far and away the worst Verizon store I have ever had the pleasure of going to and from the previous reviews I can't say that it was an isolated incident. It is currently Wednesday the 20th of June in the evening, and had I been in a leadership position I would gladly fire every single associate; don't worry I will give you reasons why. First thing walking in it, it took us walking up to associate for them to even recognize us and yes they where helping another person but there where two of them. In all previous experiences with Verizon (was customer for 10 years) it's one associate per person and everyone is greeted on entry the male greater was in the back and had to be called to the front. And when approaching the young ladies we were met with the most condescending attitude I have experienced in a while and I work in parking enforcement. Furthermore when expressing frustration about unable to call for answers because no one would pick up and instead having to drive to the store, the young ladies piped back with "well we're busy" there was one costumer in the store.< /Review><Resp>{'time': 1529682966253, 'text': 'Ryan,\nThis is an unacceptable level of customer service.

I don't understand these reviews. My experience with "Nancy" at this store was incredible. I had a very difficult situation between two phones on my Corporate account and Nancy not only took the time to remedy it, she was able to fix it when other stores were clueless to what the problem was. Nancy was calm pleasant and competent while I was anxious stressed and unhappy about the situation. I highly recommend this store because of Nancy.< /text>

Incorrect phone sent from verizon. Jackson came to our aid. He went out of his way to make it as easy as possible for us to exchange and activate new phone, even providing a new SIM card.  Every thing worked out beautifully thanks to Jackson's terrific customer service. We are very satisfied with our experience.< /Text>

Personally I got treated very well. I went in for the Note 7 recall exchange. That's when I met Tina & Charles. They did an excellent job.  I just got my new Note 7. Awesome.< /review>

<text>I got ripped off here. A very competent young lady upgraded my long standing Verizon  phone to a new iPhone X. Firstly she didn’t mention the tax on the deal and up front payment  (ok, I know tax is always extra) but she also added monthly insurance without asking me.

I do not blame her, she probably has an incentive to add insurance. I do blame Verizon managers and their company policy.

A similar approach to abusing customers by the US banks led to a crash and jail sentences. I do hope this is also in store for Verizon.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1530027157678, 'text': "Hi Chris, thank you for taking the time to write this review. I'm so sorry to hear this!

I am baffled at how inept or deceitful (not sure which one applies here) an agent of Verizon can be. On October 1, 2016 I went to the Westlake store to add an iPhone to my account... that surprisingly went very smooth. Then she offered to have us upgrade our JetPacks, which were eligible for an upgrade. She said there was a promotion that would give us a "free" upgrade. She NEVER did do an upgrade. She "added" two more units to our existing account and it was never part of a promotion. We are not being asked to pay $65.00 for each unit. I find that really really wrong! Beware of these shady sales tactics!<//text>

No patience to understand what your problem is. They are so unfriendly. I have been to other Verizon centers but this one sucks. There was their black branch manager who was so rude and disrespectful to me during the time I had problem with my phone. I mean the guy literally told me to shut up while I was trying to explain to him my problem. He told me that my accent is making him not to communicate with me properly. I mean I am speaking British English. English has been my primary language since I was born. I don’t know any other language except maybe a little French. But someone said that to me. Very rude guys.

The sale person there was rude.  They said that they will not exchange your phone or warranty the phone if it was scratched on the SECOND day you bought your phone.  So if you decided to buy your phone there better bring a magnifying glass to see if your phone was ok or else, you buy it is yours.  If they exchange it for you they will charge you a $35 restocking fee even though is not your fault.  Simply put DO NOT buy phone at verizon wireless.< /review>

<time>1386728900927< /time><Text>I wish there was a ZERO star option. Went to talk about early upgrade on my phone, they just said no. I had to bring up the new EDGE program, they gave me some run around excuse of why I'd have to purchase the phone for full retail price ($700). When i mentioned how i have been to the SIMI VALLEY RETAILER, and had worked out a way to get my upgrade early for less than retail plus accessories (TRUE STORY). They asked what deal because then they'd match it you get my business. If they can match it, they could've told me that when I first asked if they could help me. They are crooks, trying to nickel and dime people all-the-while being rude and inconsiderate. If you want good service, where the people treat you as they should, like people who pay for their hourly wage, take the trip to SIMI VALLEY MALL VERIZON.< /Text>< gmapID>

I refuse to go in this store.  I have told the on-line reps that an in store option will not happen at Westlake.  Rude, appointments well in advance and you still have to wait.  Camarillo and Oxnard are considerably better, although I am generally frustrated with Verizon.</review>

<Text>Very nice countryside store inside the Shell gas station. They have everything from hamburgers to deli sandwiches and also Mexican food. Smiths bakery is here and a butcher shop with high quality meat. I heard the food is very good. I ordered just a hamburger and it was very good. The restrooms are extremely clean and the store is well-kept all the employees are very nice</Text>< name>

Good gasoline top-tier but the price is very high. I don't mind paying extra if there's air for my tires water for my radiator and plenty of cleaning supplies for the windshield. Nice clean restroom at the Shell station should take a hint from this one</Review>

<review>I been coming to eat there but in the last three months it seems the service is bad.Two weeks ago we were there and I order turkey wrap and they were out of.So he said let check and see if we have any turkey breast the contender was on the counter it was not on the cold box.Last night we get the special fish and chips combos didn't get the drinks and the cold slaw was hot and it had little bubble on top.We put in the trash.The service was bad.We live across the street from the business I thing it be along time before we go back.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Prices are ridiculous - gas and in store items but it's very clean and easy off and on access from 58 for a pit stop.</Text>

We love coming here. We are a family of three and we all enjoy this place. Our favorite is the bridge near by. It's perfect for a little walk. Our 2-year old son loves the play area a lot.<//review>

San Ramon is a great place for walkers.. You can walk, miles and miles, in absolute silence... There's a park in every neighborhood..

I love in Bangalore India... When I visit San Ramon, the first thing I would like to do is to step out and walk in the stoic still of the trails..</Review>

Excellent place to take your kids. Wide field for sports like soccer and a playground, all next to a nice creek under the bridge you can relax near.</review>

Mostly we just walk or jog through this park on our daily exercise but its usually full of families large and small and always looks like everyone is having a great time. Lots of dog owners like to play with their animals on the lawn and I have also seen volleyball nets and soccer practice happening on the lawn as well (though its not big enough for a real soccer field.) It's really a fairly small park but big enough for the tiny community it supports I guess. Being right next to a creek full of neat wildlife makes it a great place for a peaceful walk when its quiet enough to hear the birds.<//Text>

Nice neighborhood park. Good play structures for kids, complete with small climbing wall. Tennis courts, 2 bocce courts, BBQ grills and some picnic tables. Parking lot, street parking, and restrooms that are normally both open and clean. Good spot for kids to play, for birthday parties or just to walk the dog.</text>

Nice quiet park. A great place for kids to run and play. There are benches around the play area for parents to easily keep an eye on their kids. Big open, grassy area for kids to play tag, play catch, etc.<//Review>

<review>I like this park, but I do not like how I have heard that some kids that hang out around here bully other kids. Just do not let your kids go to the park without an adult... this goes for any park.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Quiet little park, tucked away in a sleepy suburb.  This park is a lot of fun because it has tennis courts, bocce ball courts, playground equipment, expansive grass field and working bathrooms.</Review>

This place been around since I was a teen and I'm sure before that. I'm in my mid 30s went back here and can't stop! It's a very delicious tasting pizza. Dough soft and crisp in just the right places. Sauce is genuine to my liking. Nice little location as well with great deals. It's my one stop before I got the road just wish it was in my city so it's a must go when I'm in Sacramento and in the area.<//review>

I called and ordered a pizza with artichokes peppers onions and mushrooms.  I got a pizza with that and probably 100 black olives which I had to pick off.  I have never seen so many olives on one pizza which is great if you love olives and awful if you are like me and hate olives, didn't order them and had to pick them off.  The portion of the other veggies was minimal too so the olives were overwhelming. The crust was okay a little sweet for my taste soI would not return.  It is disappointing when you order something and get something else.  So carelessness in either reading the order or taking the order isn't cool.</Review>

Delivery driver never showed up. Store manager told me that it could take up to 3 days for a refund. The store manager was unapologetic and unconcerned. I asked him about his delivery drivers ability to do his job correctly. He didn't care. I will never buy another pizza from this place again!</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Worst place ever! The manager was really unprofessional. Very rude. Never get HALAL!!! food from here. We ordered HALAL chicken wings from here and it tastes like a dead rat and couldn't stop vomiting after only taking one bite of the chicken wing. I went back to get my refund with the food and the owner said don't piss me off and get the F**k out of my store just for asking for the refund the food I didn't eat. I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone and please be careful from getting food poisoning from their disgusting and old food.< /Review>< Pictures>

Just disgusting period! First time ordering from here and the last. The so called HALAL chicken wings tasted like an old rat dead for months and left on the counter. The pizza was dry and old. Only two bites of the food made me throw up immediately. Went back to the store to get my refund for the untouched food and the owner said to me that he didn't care if I get food poisoning or end up in the hospital. He kicked me out of the store and told me never to come back. I don't recommend this place to anyone. WORST PLACE EVER!!!!< /text>

The delivery was faster then said . However I am furious about the fact that the receipt said one thing but my online bank account said a lot more was taken out then what the total was. Be careful with that Asian guy that delivers. He will make sure to take out a good tip himself if you don't hand him a tip! I will be pressing charges!<//text>

The location makes you question how the pizza was going to be but after that it is only uphill from there. The staff was very friendly,  I got the Garlic chicken and  it was Amazing! Much better than BJs or California Pizza kitchen and for a delivery place it is unbeatable! Thank you, Red Runner.<//text>

<Text>This place has very good pizza! I recommend trying the creamy garlic sauce on your pepperoni pizza,  its amaizing and loaded with good flavor< /Text>< pictures>

I ordered a pizza and wings on a recommendation from a friend in Sacramento. The pizza came earlier than expected, which was good. However, it all went downhill from there. The wings were overcooked, swimming in grease, and practically tasteless. The pizza crust was overdone, partially burned, and there were not one, but three, yes, THREE black hairs on two pieces of the pizza. And they were not "fuzzies", but full-on two inch black head hairs.

I would NOT recommend this place to anyone!< /text>

<Pics>None</Pics><review>Good pizza, small location, good service, no amenities out in the public area, probably because it's so small,  have to ask for everything, good pizza, don't use the same hands that handles money and makes pizza, you will lose some business that way.
I'm coming back though and expect to be a repeat.
Tessa, i understand your frustration but comments like "foreigners" implies you and i aren't and the last i checked, only the native Americans are native and the rest of us "foreigners".<//review><Date>1462997540737</Date>< GmapID>

They hung up on me, had to drive all the way there to place my order then the owner apologized like he didn't care. $3 off my order did not raise my opinion of their horrible customer service. They charge more for delivery than they discounted my drive, time and hassle. Not recommended.</review>

<Text>Horrible place to order pizza. We had ordered the Chicken Tikka pizza and they did not use white meat; they used red meat and not only that, most of the meat in the pizza was chicken fat. Yes, fats from the chicken. I'm so disgusted by that. Made me sick to my stomach after we realized it was chicken fat.< /Text>< pictures>

Staff rude (waitresses) and no one wearing a mask. As a nurse I don't feel safe eating here. The sign posted says wait to be seated and after standing there for a min and making eye contact with the waitress a few times she finally barked at me to come "order over here". I left.< /Text>

We sat at the high top counter outside and got a spot in the shade. Felt safe as the staff and customers observed Covid guidelines and were spread out. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with fruit side. The pulled pork was awesome (sweet/smokey with just the right amount of sauce)on a toasted brioche bun. The fruit (grapes, pear, strawberries) were sweet. Husband got same but with fries which he said were very tasty (crispy waffle cut). Mint julip in honor of the Kentucky Derby was cold and refreshing. Lastly, our waitress(a pleasant blond young lady) was efficient and friendly. Overall, a great lunch experience and would recommend.< /review>

<rating>5</rating><username>Wendy Wittmann< /username><review>Fantastic pub with great food, staff, and ambience! Tasty and dramatic rye cocktail, the Old 40 Fashioned, is served tableside by torching the citrus on a cedar plank (made from the same wood used on their bar). The glass is then turned upside down, filling the glass with smoke. Meanwhile, a deep pour of rye mixes with cherry, bourbon, and simple syrup and then gets poured over the flames citrus and topped with a cherry. You can really taste the citrus oils and boy, does this cocktail work! I'm also a fan of the Phobe sandwich and their famous chili. So happy to live so close to this culinary gem. Also, the patio is dog friendly and they handle pick-up orders wonderfully!</review><pics>None<//pics><Gmap_id>0x809be773e967a3b5:0x5b163d10762a94ec<//Gmap_id><userid>117799702605025212341</userid></record>

Service was sloooow but may have been the COVID operations.  I thought $25 for two fish tacos and a beer was too pricey.  Food was good though and the server was friendly, when he eventually showed up with the food.  Almost an hour for what should have been a 30 minute lunch.  Not sure, but I think I visited the Pub on the last Saturday in September, arriving at around 2 PM, well after the lunch rush.  Was able to park in front of the restaurant and was seated (outside) immediately.  Waited roughly ten minutes for someone to take my order and way too long for the food to arrive.  There were at least three servers working the outside area and maybe ten +/- customers seated outside.  Perhaps just a bad day in the kitchen.< /text>

<Text>We had an unexpected detour from I 80 on Sunday night.  The Pub was open with lots of lively locals cheering for the 49ers.  Server recommended the pulled pork sandwich special with special (delicious) fried potatoes.  We also ordered the elk sausage platter with mashed potatoes and a sophisticated mushroom sauce which was awesome.  Food was served promptly and everything was delicious.  Put us back on the road in excellent spirits.< /Text>< Pics>

Lovely little cozy pub, very convient if you are staying on the south shore of Donner Lake. Food was delicious, but you are definitely paying tourist town prices for some of the items with meat, fish, or seafood.

The beer batter they use for several items is phenomenal. I had it on their pickle chips and my mom on the prawns. The pastrami on their pub club sandwich is also great.

They also have a reward program that sounds good for regulars.<//text>

I'm in love with their breakfast burrito. Their fries are thick, crispy and fluffy inside. The service was excellent, the decor was very nice, and did I mention this breakfast burrito?? It was life-changing. I am a new man.< /text>

Staff is great but the food is overpriced. Just got a chicken Caesar to go and paid $17 for a cup of romaine, two cherry tomatoes, a couple tablespoons of croutons and a teaspoon of Parmesan.  Oh and two things of dressing- they doubled down on dressing and forgot the chicken. Stick to the pub burger or fish and chips which are more worth the price.< /review>

< Review>
Honestly, I was super excited about this place because I live down the street. First experience- the beer selection is TERRIBLE. How about getting some good IPAs, or anything that’s new/exciting. So many craft brewery places around the area, might be a good idea to get some kegs from them. We didn’t even get food because the prices were too high. $17 for a burger plus $2 for toppings?! And $22 for fish and chips! I’m sure it’s great food but local people don’t want to eat here and spend $50 for a meal and two drinks. Also- where’s the happy hour?! Or locals discount?!<//Review>
<response>{'time': 1564854598249, 'text': 'Hello Kristin, we would like to thank you for the honest review. As we are currently in our opening month, we are still trying to get the logistics ironed out for a happy hour. We hope to have one starting in mid-August. We are also currently advertising in the locals coupon magazine for the fall edition as we unfortunately missed the summer edition. We do hope that you come back in the future to try the American ¹/2 pound Waygu beef cheeseburger and Mahi Mahi Fish with Sidewinder PUB fries.'}< /response><gmap_id>0x809be773e967a3b5:0x5b163d10762a94ec< /gmap_id><userid>118042888444128537500<//userid><Date>1563852166631</Date>< rate>

<review>Great food menu and amazing drink menu. They have like 80 something different kinds of whiskey! It did take a bit to get my food, but the night I was there the place was packed full. I really enjoyed the wagyu burger! It was cooked exactly how I wanted. The bartender was on top of our drinks. I can’t wait to return! This place will be awesome in the winter after a long day of skiing and even better in the summer on the outdoor patio area. Amazing location where nothing else can compare.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

My biggest fear with giving this place a 5 star rating is that other people will read it and decide to visit :).  Jokes aside this place had extraordinarily generous portions, amazing cocktails, wonderful service with smiles all round and overall a casual atmosphere that makes you feel entirely welcome.  We have been twice and we will definitely be back!< /text>

< Review>
Showed up on opening day (unbeknownst to us).  Ran into friends so we shared a long table. Food was great, staff was friendly. The places was packed. I thought they were doing such an awesome job given it was their first day. We're optimistic that over time the kinks will be ironed out. My only suggestion would be to have a greeter take names for waitlist and manage expectations (maybe they have already?.) As far as the prices on the menu, they're the going rate for anywhere on the west coast.  We'll go back for sure. Can't beat the location. So long overdue.</Review>

<text>My wife and I found this place while traveling over the Sierras. We tried stopping in downtown Truckee but it was completely gridlocked with zero places to park, so we headed down the road to the next exit and found The Pub. What a great place! Friendly, welcoming staff greeted us and within 2 minutes we had cold beers in front of us, despite them being pretty busy. My wife and I shared pickle chips and a waygu burger and both were fantastic. Not wanting to leave when we finished our food, we ended things with an Old 40 Fashioned. I've had so many bad Old Fashioneds I've almost stopped ordering them. It seems mixing a proper cocktail is a lost art these days. But we were both beyond pleased with this one. It was just the right amount of sweet, spice and kick. At this point we realized the gentleman who made the drink was in fact the owner and we had a really nice conversation with him. What a nice guy. It was a great visit and we'll definitely be back the next time we're through the area!</text><gmapID>0x809be773e967a3b5:0x5b163d10762a94ec</gmapID><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

Awesome location, just off the road with a great outside patio for a drink before dinner (“The Pub” lager was excellent); we were seated at the island table inside with a short wait despite the wedding party that was using the facility at the same time. The waitress was very helpful with some recommendations although she was obviously very busy. We ordered the fish and chips and the melon salad, the fish and chips were fantastic!! Mahi mahi fish and chips was the best I’ve ever had and the salad was more fruit salad then expected but nonetheless delicious. Would definitely go again to discover more of the menu.<//review>

I went here for my covid-19 vaccinations. The facility was clean, organized, and efficient. Parking was easy too. Recommended for your vaccinations, if you still need them.< /review>

(Translated by Google) The auditorium is beautiful! The atmosphere is kind of melancholy, but maybe I got that impression because I visited the place on the day of the vaccination! LOL

<review>Moderately easy access from two different street's, limited parking space available, parking lot is unpaved. Place of business is also accessible by cement ramp and there is delivery service by a box moving truck available. Prices are fair, the staff is friendly & helpful..

Always when I call nobody answers. A lot of stress and lies. When they say they will deliver my furniture today they don't even show up and don't even bother to call. Next day after a couple of attempts to talk to them all they say it will be there today. I don't recommend . 😡< /Text>

<resp>None< /resp><text>We bought a sofa set with chase and very next day after purchase the pillows were all out of shapes. We brought pillows to Turlock shop but then had to bring at Modesto shop to be filled up and reshaped we had to make numerous trips and kept asking them to fix them or return or exchange it but they just giving us hard time running around. We are now seeking legal action to honor warranty.
Bad service and lots of head aches and stress.

<Text>I would leave a lower review if i could honestly, i had the worst experience here. I purchased a bedroom set in the Turlock location where they claimed to call me on Monday to let me know whether it would be delivered by the next Tuesday or Wednesday and nothing. I called and no answer, I had to SHOW UP and ask what was happening then the guy who i made the purchase with, Tony,  resumed to tell me it would be delivered the next day by 3 pm. Next day I get a call from the Modesto location telling me THEY DIDNT EVEN HAVE IT. And just a few days after inserting my debit card for the purchase my account was EMPTIED and suddenly after they just didn’t care less if i continued with the purchase. These people are a JOKE AND POSSIBLY SCAMMERS DON’T WASTE YOUR TIME.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< user>

Amazing gelato. A little pricey, but it’s so worth it. I got a pint of lime gelato, and it was the perfect mix between sweet and citrusy. They have a large variety of flavors, different sizes for everyone, and I even saw on the menu that you can get a bundt cake with a gelato scoop on top. That’s pretty creative. Service was good and bathrooms were clean too.</text>

My son loves the Cookies flavor. The Dole Whip is also a family favorite to get too. (We do wish there was a Hazelnut or Pistachio flavor too besides all the fun cookie flavors)<//Review>

The gelato here is delicious! It has been some time since our last visit and I'm not sure what changed but I loved the new flavors and the 'sundae' of the month (key lime) was amazing. Aldo's is great for the whole family. I would definitely recommend!</Text>

<Text>A great place to get ice cream, gelato, and other related desserts! The indoor dining setting is great and trendy. Clean floors and tables. The staff is wonderful and so polite even though it was close to closing time and the place was packed. They were very patient even though they were young, pretty rare nowadays. I'll be coming back soon, every ten purchases you get a free one via punch ticket.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80903ccf572d708b:0xf78bc7ce0f97e55b<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The product was amazing the service a lil dry the older gentlemen in there I think he was the owner kind of just acted like my business didn't matter  my kids loved the icecream though
A lil on the expensive side but worth it

I'm still giving it 4 stars because it's a clean nice restaurant and has really good icecream</review>

I had never been here and upon walking in I told the young lady this. Instead of explaining anything she just stood there.  So I look at the board with all the prices and chose a flavor and size.  She rings me up and says $9.56 I said excuse me?  Out of all the prices the highest was 6 something so I said why? how? She then looks around and finally finds the hand written chalk board thing all the way on the back wall away from the pricing list and explains a buy one get one prepackaged deal.  I told her that since I had never been there and that I had told her that when I came in that maybe she should have explained things to me.  Not gonna pay ten dollars for a pint of anything.  She then sends the other girl to cash me out while she fixed my order, handed it to me without saying a word.  They both turned their backs to me and mumbled crap to each other as I left.  The ice cream or gelato was good but  didnt knock my socks off , could've gotten a pint of Ben Jerry's for real.  I will not go back ever.  Very unprofessional and rude< /review>

Great variety of Italian ice flavors! They are pretty good (tho slight sugar overload). The Gelatos are good as well but I usually prefer the Italian ice. You can get a Nothing Bundt Cake topped with Gelato too!< /text>

The gelato is pretty good.  I got the "Al Dough", which was basically like a donut stuffed with Gelato.  It was tasty, but the donut was a little Meh.  I'd go back, but I don't think I'll go out my way to get there.</Text>

What a great little gelateria! My kids ordered the snickers gelato, the birthday cake gelato, and a blue raspberry Italian ice. All three were delicious! I'm not a fan of kiddie birthday cake flavored anything, but this was really good! The Italian ice was smooth and refreshing. I look forward to coming back and trying their "al-dough". This will definitely be a go to dessert stop for us!<//text>

2nd time we have been, and 2nd time they were out of pistachio, but it was probably less than an hour before closing. Other than that everyone enjoyed what they had<//Review>

<rate>4<//rate><text>I was sad to find out that Chilaberries was gone, but Aldo is a great replacement for this strip mall.

I ordered the al-Dough with Nutella gelato and strawberries.  They put those ingredients in a bun, and seal it in a waffle-esque iron.  It tasted like a funnel cake especially with the addition of powdered sugar.  It can be shared with two people because it's quite filling.  The also have custards and Italian ices.

The decor has a diner feel, and it was pretty clean.  I will probably come back again when I'm craving ice cream.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

This isn't gelato people, but a mediocre and over rated melted ice cream joint. Go to Sweet Orchid in Union City, CA if you want quality gelato 👌</review>

<text>First time coming here called ahead to make sure they were not busy and we can walk in for a cut. Friendly over the phone. Arrived and only had to wait about 5 minutes before they started cutting my boyfriend's hair.
After giving limited detail on how to cut, the Barber William seemed to know exactly the style that we described. Haircut was quick and was done exactly how he wanted it. I think we found our new regular haircut place🤗< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOctN3APbGypSwPVE-y8WP5IpH7RvRnjaqutsM8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<text>So I've gotten my hair cut here and it was great! The staff was nice and gave me a nice haircut. We had nice conversation and I will gladly come back to this place. The barber was helpful when I asked for advice on how I should get my hair cut. And he gave me a great cut so what else can someone ask for? I will recommend his service to my friends.< /text>< Pictures>

I will definitely be back at your beauty shop again because you made me very happy when you did a haircut on me last Monday afternoon. I also observed that the place was very cleaned and well-organized. Thanks a lot, guys! Keep up the excellent service! Very highly recommended in the region! See you next time!< /review>

I’ve been here a couple times, simply because it’s close and cheap
But just because it’s cheap, doesn’t mean you can be rude to your customers!
I feel like this is more of a place for older customers. Why? Because Margarita and the other stylists (if they should be called that, because let’s be honest: they’re cuts are a bit on the beginners side) prioritize the older customers
For example, I went today, to get a trim. Or TRIED to. I called ahead of time and asked if there was someone who could cut with a razor comb. They said yes, so I made an appointment. They said “okay, that time sounds fine. See you soon” so, of course, I went in.
But then a much older lady came in and margarita prioritized her first, claiming she had made an appointment. So of course I let it slide. But then! Another older lady came and margarita said she would do her cut after the one I already let go first. And I looked at her and said that I had already made an appointment and that it wasn’t fair
Margarita didn’t seem to care
So I walked out

Ex2: about two years ago, margarita gave me a hair cut
Again, with a razor comb. This woman didn’t care for the style I wanted. Proceeded to cut my hair her way and in the process, yanked my hair multiple times

Ex3: maybe towards the beginning of 2019: I went in during the middle of the week. It wasn’t busy. And a shorter, short haired woman was there. She claimed to know how to cut with a razor comb, and at first was nice, so i agreed. I was just happy that it wasn’t the rude a** Margarita. The lady proceeded to get the razor comb and asked how I wanted my hair
I specifically told her I wanted a trim with layer (my hair is already layered. So I wanted to keep the layers)
This woman started cutting my hair. And she cut chunks of it! I went in for a trim! And she got at least 6inches!
So unless, you want unprofessional, just stay far away
Cheap shouldn’t mean low quality.< /text>

Barnes & Noble is as much an experience as it is a store, I've always enjoyed meandering through bookstores and B&N is top notch. Very clean, tidy with helpful employees. They lose 1 star for books being a bit hard to locate in the current organization system. Sections sit right against each other with no delineation between them besides an abrupt change in Alphabetical order.....< /text>

<Review>I love me the book stores that became popular in the 90's where you were welcome to sit drink coffee and skim a book to decide if you wanted to purchase it. With B. Dalton & Borders all gone, those of us not near a trendy boutique book store really only have Barns & Noble left for this casual feeling.  This B&N, while not a boutique book nook, is a good substitute until you can find one to spend the day in.</Review><UserId.>115058434799659415960< /UserId.><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_name>

I wanted to write this review because everybody including the manager and the employee who was being yelled at for no reason handled this situation with grace and much more patience than I would have had. I heard the customer yell that they were going to write a bad review, so I'm trying to beat them to the punch. Amy, the employee who was getting yelled at, is one of my favorite workers here and was phenomenal in this situation!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Nice place, friendly staff, good location, surprisingly more manga than I expected. (more than an A1 Comic Book Shop would have but not as much as a place in Manhattan New York for example where they have an entire floor of a book store dedicated to manga.)< /text>

I went into the Starbucks and there was an entrance to Barnes & Noble there. I have not wandered though a bookstore in ages, 40 years to be exact. There is just something about holding the book, breathing in the aroma of fresh ink and paper, skimming through it before you buy it. You cannot get that with Amazon!< /text>

<Text>What bookworm doesn't love B&N? It us a different experience like every thing else. They didn't get five stars because while they have great customer service there is no seating allowed anywhere anymore.  For me it's just ad easy to shop on line if I can't sit for a bit to decide which book I'm taking home. Coffee shop was also closed.< /Text><Resp>None</Resp>< UserId.>

<review>AWESOME STAFF! Every employee I have ever had the pleasure of assisting me has always gone above and beyond. Either by finding me exactly what I need with me usually giving some misguided Title or a less than helpful reference. Or they refer  something that will fulfill my needs that is cheaper and/or better. Can't say enough awesome things about the employees at this location! Oh and an amazing selection of books trinkets and well just rad s#!+! A MOST EXCELLENT STAFF FOR SURE THOUGH!!< /review>< Pics>

<Text>Such a fun store to visit. Barnes has a very wide selection of books to look at, anyone could easily spend hours in there. It's also very clean and has nice workers greeting you. There's always a fun section for the kids too. Overall a great place! Definitely worth visiting if you've never been there before.< /Text>< gmapID>

I truly appreciate Barnes & Noble's order online,  pick up in store service.  I wanted a signed book to give as a Christmas present. I planned to go to the store first thing the morning it went on sale,....but company showed up early and changed all my plans. I was able to order the book online and pick the book up after they left! Thank goodness I ordered it, because they were out of the signed books by the time I got there!
The store is clean, organized and well stocked! The staff is so helpful!!!</review>

I didn't realize what a cool place this is. Stopped in for a book on my daughter's Christmas list and left with lots of great stuff I couldn't have found anywhere else. Not just books but toys, movies, vinyl records, and other fun stuff. I will go back for sure. The staff was so helpful even though it was right before Christmas and the phones were ringing off the hook.</Text>

Can't sit around to preview books and the attached Starbucks is closed due to Covid, but we all need to go to our local book stores for our reading needs.  Yeah, it's a bit cheaper and more convenient to order through Amazon but we should all do our part to keep our local book stores open.< /review>

I have always been happy with the service and inventory of books, magazines, movies, games and all other things they carry that I have forgotten, sorry.  I love having my account at Barnes and Noble and participating in it to help me save money on items.  Recently, my Wife and I bought a good number of books and saved $50.00; I will take fifty bucks any day.  You can do your own research by asking how you too can save a few bucks by asking their great staff.  God Bless You All!!!</review>

What an amazing place. If you haven't ever been here, you are missing out. So much more than just books. From music to collectibles. So many toys and games! Incredible stuff. Russell helped us with finding things we were looking for and guided us around. Extremely helpful and friendly staff! Precisely what I am looking for in a book store!<//text>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>The reason I am giving this place such a bad rating is the deceptive 50% clearance section they have. The second I saw the clearance I was interested in finding a good deal and I realized quickly all the prices for these "clearance" items are marked up 50% so there is just the illusion of the items being on clearance. I challenge anyone to go to the clearance section find a clearance product that isn't selling at same price on Amazon and other online sites. This puts into question for me is anything in the store selling at a reasonable price? Even places like target have a clearance section that's isn't an illusion.</Text><gmap_id>0x809ade237c347e8b:0x6ddd1e139a747b36</gmap_id>< response>

<Text>I went to this Barnes & Noble expecting them to have a DVD on hold for me.  However when I called, I had the impression that the lady who answered the phone didn't take me seriously when I told her that I'd go and buy it. Just as I imagined, when I got there, I I realized I had been ignored on my request. They had to look for it, and I could have drove or driven all the way from East Sac for nothing. They truly need to have people on the phone that are willing to do better costumer service.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>aguilacec<//user_name><user>110096033912847480968<//user></record>

This is a great clean and friendly store. They have lots of options for books and other items. They are more than happy to help you locate the item your looking for.< /Review>

<Review>I just love books. I honestly have not been inside a B&N in years. I love the set up of the tables. The decor. Starbucks inside adds a bit more, makes you want to stay awhile.<//Review><Name>Christine Crooks< /Name><UserId.>105730196987557520614</UserId.>< gmap_id>

Shopping online is so easy these days but nothing compares to the experience of flipping through the pages of a book before you purchase!</Review>

I always find something great when I go here.. If they don't have a book I want they order it.  I love that there is a Starbucks here as I like to sip and browse... They have a great little game section that I find cute stuff for me and my disabled Son. They are very helpful too... Finding the books I'm missing in my series or helping me get them in the right order to read...

Doubles as a toy store, great kids literature section, Starbucks "in"/adjacent to store. Rated for the kiddos usage, and starbucks proximity for me. I seldom buy anything for myself.< /Text>

<text>I really love this place. Has CD's. books, toys, and much more. Has variety of books and they sell books of Selena Quintanilla which is where I got the book for To Selena, with love. Books can be pricey but you can get good and brand new books for a good price. They have a mini area for kids to read books and have some stuffed animals which I think they are so cute. Right next to Barnes and nobles their is a Starbucks so you can buy a book and coffee and read your book while drinking a expensive coffee but good tasting coffee if you make good choices. Customer Service good. Sometimes employees are to slow. There is restrooms in here. Out of 5 I give it a 8 stars.< /text><UserId.>112207961278631463297</UserId.><Rating>5</Rating>< Pics>

Barnes and Nobel in the Birdcage Center is my go to for books, CD, and gifts when I am unable to find them on Amazon or the time frame doesnt allow for ordering. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. They have helped me on numerous occasions find or sometimes order books which are hard to find. Location has an attached Starbucks location, also jamba juice is a short walk down the center.<//Review>

Interesting since I was a first-timer in there and was walking around not finding what I wanted so I got help and got what I needed I guess I should have asked a little earlier for it  I'm a guy I don't like to ask for help it's what I was looking for and that's what I needed and they had it</Review>

These guys are great! I needed a movie that was on backorder in several different book stores, and online... They allowed me to pay for it online and come pick it up within hours! Thank you Heather and Russell for getting everything done quickly and orderly! You helped our movie night actually have A MOVIE! LOL! 👍< /Text>

Was surprised to see her every corner we turned acting as if she was organizing a product but watching us.

It's not what it used to be. Then again, not many book stores are like they used to be. Way too commercialized, even for B&N.

The store is in good order. Everything looks to be clean. Due to the vagrant population growing in town, there were a few wondering around the store making it interesting to navigate. The staff all seemed to be busy, but at checkout the lady behind the counter was pleasant and friendly.<//Review>

Do not let them rely on the computer to do their job for them. Go search out that grizzled employee that actually knows the store, then and only then, will you find what you are looking for. If that person can't find it then they really don't have it. At that point you'll realize why you stopped buying books in stores in the first place.</Review>< Pictures>

It's a great book store. Information desk is always helpful. But they are extremely pushy when it comes to the yearly membership and subscription. I don't care about saving $20 over a whole year. I shouldn't have to say no 3-5 times Everytime I buy something.</Text>

Always a great time......may have to wait in line (can sometimes be very busy) so whether you're a book nerd like myself or just looking for a quick gift. They pretty much have everything & if they don't, they'll try to get it for you. Friendly staff. Great help desk (again.....be patient, it can get busy at times & there are only a limited number of people working the desk.)</review>

<review>This is a wonderful Barnes & Nobles.
Service always great! They are Consistent .I purchased Michelle Obama 's "Becoming " And for a steal of her Deal also purchased another book by our former first lady, "Michelle Obama '"a Photographic Journey. ..By the way walked right into Starbucks Tea.

This is one of the smaller locations but they still have a good collection. And they can have things sent if it's requested. Store is orderly and clean. They have a public restroom and seating areas around the store.< /Text>

I love how they have so much variety of things here from books to electronics, art supplies and gifts. Always friendly staff and I don't feel harassment from the workers if I'm in the store too long or anything like that I would get from other stores. The environment is good and I see other people enjoying themselves also.< /review>

If you love the smell of coffee this place is for you as it and Starbucks share the same airspace. Employees always, always, always curtious. I am not a coffee lover,  so its one star since the aroma makes it intolerable for for book only lovers.</Text>

<Text>Barnes and Nobles is a place you can get lost in! A quick trip can turn into an hour of just searching, looking, touching all the things available to the readers hearts desire.
I went there looking for gift card for my niece, and spent 55 minutes just looking around at all the books, DVD and CDs, arts and crafts, and even stopped in Starbucks. Any place that has a Starbucks gets ⭐🌟⭐⭐stars from me! 🤗
The one thing I get from Barnes & Nobles, is inspiration!   I am an artist, and they have a tremendous amount of tools for every media that I like to work in.<//Text>< date>

Checkouts are lined with adult magazines like Playboy etc and they refuse to move them or even cover the explicit parts. My god even gas stations cover them I would expect them to be more family friendly then a gas station or porn shop but apparently not... Never take your family here!!!! Not to mention many other distasteful attributes this trash establishment has chosen to embrace. Oh and they only pretend to price match just in case you were thinking they were good for something....< /text>

Pretty good Barnes and Noble, no seating though so it's difficult to read the first few pages of a book to see if you're interested. The in store Starbucks is a welcome addition.<//text>

<rating>1</rating><review>I went to the front desk to ask a question.  The manager Tamiko was on the phone. I waited until she was of the phone, then asked my question. she looked at me , then, without a word, turned her back and walked way. There was no " excuse,  just a moment. Nothing.  When I said that it was rude, she just said she had to help someone else at the other end. That's totally fine, but to say nothing, make no acknowledgement and just walk away is not fine.<//review>< pics>

I'm usually really happy with Barnes and Noble but when I want to return a book that was published by/for Barnes and Noble so their name is on the book, why do I have to prove I bought it there? Its in new condition...it is their Aesop Fables book.  I have a legitimate reason for returning it too. Why would you publish, and then continue to sell an Aesop Fables book that only has half of the morals after the stories?  I spend a lot of money here, but with the clerk's flippant attitude and unwillingness to do anything about the situation,  I will be buying from Amazon.<//Review>

< review>
The staff is ALWAYS nice, friendly and helpful. There's also a Starbucks next door/inside, so you can buy a book and grab a coffee or tea too! This location is very nice and clean and organized, with the exception of the Clearance section that can be in a little disarray due to obvious scavenging.<//review>

Cool place to browse and the employees are always helpful. If you don't want to wait for and spend $ on shipping this place is for you! Great books but you will be paying retail. Fun stuff everywhere!</Review>

Employees most helpful, helped find the one last book they had in terms back but didn't show in inventory. Went well out of their way while we sipped on yummy drinks from inside Starbucks!< /Review>

Their scifi collection tends to cater too much to youth/new age selections. Also, I'm not sure why they offer vinyl records, they are dependably much more expensive than Amazon with the same options available.</Text>

Barnes & Noble is a favorite place for any Avid book reader! However they don't have enough seating. I do have at least 9 tables with chairs but it seems to always be full.</Text>

I love Barnes and Noble because they pretty much have everything but when I get to the register and pay I become sad because they price is so high in price. I under stand they need to keep revenue but I have to save money before going into there. This is a very helpful place it is very busy with people but I usually get help promptly< /Text>

Management was ignorant of store policy and and rude beyond that. I was attempting to pay for an item I had on hold when the manager, Tamico, hung up the phone. I received opposition at every step of a process that should have been extremely simple.</Text>

I'll continue to go there simply because they have the best selection of books. I must say though, Their employees are not nice. I've been bumped into by one of the guys there and he told me to watch where I was standing. As for all the others, they just appear to be elitist. I try to avoid the employees at all costs.  Still though, they have good books.<//text>

I've need visiting this Barnes and Noble for years, I love the huge selection of books and having Starbucks nearby provides it a comfy feel. You can grab your cup of coffee and enjoy a good book.<//Review>

<rate>1</rate><review>I ordered textbooks twice and both experiences were AWFUL. The first time the order was wrong and took place in the arden store.The second time I decided to bypass the store and go online.I paid for expedited shipping and the book didn't arrive until six days later.I had an email saying it had shipped the next day but according to customer service it didn't ship until three days later. They didn't refund my money and I made a formal complaint via email  to the vice president(according to customer service) and someone called me back the next day just to tell me she can't do anything for me after 17 minutes. The customer service and problems from with this company in regards to ethics in business is appalling.  I couldn't even use the coupon they sent me in my email the week before. Do yourself a favor and use anywhere else for books. Be aware also that they don't rent for the standard 120 day semester but 60 days instead and thats why the price looks low. This is different than other places also.I will never return to Barnes and Noble. There isn't diversity in their stores either. The stores are outdated and overpriced.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I am currently on my 6th back to back call to this store, and no one is answering the phone other than the automated answering machine.   When they finally answer, I am asked "Can I hold?"< /Review>
