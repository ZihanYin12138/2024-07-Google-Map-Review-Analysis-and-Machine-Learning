<review>Excellent food. Much better than the one with the chihuahua mascot! Their food is more authentic Mexican food, with all plates including rice and beans. Traditional.  I got the fish tacos and a Chimichanga to go and they were both great!  The chimichanga was nice and large with sour cream and all the good stuff in it.
. I'm not thrilled with the hot sauce they put on the side though, so I suggest offering more alternatives for that.  This place is very close to Home Depot and American Tire. A good place to go while waiting on your tire to get fixed. There's also a Walmart across the street.< /review>< pictures>

Friendly staff, very good food. And it's open 24/7 too! The menu has breakfast, lunch, and dinner selection! The store is very clean and stocked with condiments. They have an A rating from the health inspection.</review>

My daughter was hungry and told me about this place that she and her friend goes to when she visits. After finding out that the drive through was open 24hrs, we decided to try out too. The service was good and the cashier taught us how to say "Horchata" properly, lol. The food was really good too. Overall, would recommend!</Review>

<review>I really wanted to like this place but get very mixed results in service. Sometimes I get exactly what I asked for, sometimes their cashier is in a mood, and sometimes I dont get what I paid extra for. Today I called but no answer. When I walked over (i don't have a car) to see if they would let me order in person the door the was locked. Tried another call when I saw someone inside but instead they watched me call and just didnt pick up.< /review>< Date>

<text>My girlfriend and I go in the drive through and put our order respectfully  and we did not even get a total of the order ,which is fine but straight cut us off. I asked her for ranch please, politely as well ,I'm owner of a retailer so I understand  but the lady that took our order and gave us our food ,heard me ask for ranch and she lowkey came back and ignored me and let the sliding window just shut and ignored us. Pretty rude I'd say.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80dafd36c4a194c3:0x4ff9deb21795da66</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Just had a quesadilla there. One of the worst quesadillas Ive ever had. Couldn't eat it. Dried out tortilla. Tasteless dry cheese. If they dont want to be a place for people to get food to eat they should just close up and save everyone the hassle.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>This is hands down the best location. Its quiet and hardly busy. And a great break when you've stormed the isles of Costco and survived the war (or it feels like it). But, the food at this location is plenty and super fresh! I've never ever had a bad experience here and I've visited here at least a dozen times. Good prices and large portions.< /Review>< Pictures>

I live in Yucca Valley, the store here , Joshua Tree and 29 Palm are very good. I have been to the Costco Center store a number of times, no one in the parking lot or drive through. Yesterday I ordered 3 bean and cheese burritos with extra cheese, they did charge me $1.50 each for extra cheese but when I got home there was no extra cheese. Really? No other customers in the restaurant and no wonder .</Text>

1st visit ordered a taco & enchilada combo. All was delicious w/the exception of the enchilada. I called, voiced my concern (overcooked hard tortilla).  They told me to save my receipt and returned for a full meal. Which I did, and the food was excellent!</review>

Has Always Been My Go To Fast Food For Their California Al Pastor Burritos And Al Pastor Fries But A New Lady On The Night Shift Has Driven Me Insane Not Once But Twice. First Time She Was Trying To Charge Me Almost 40$ For Just Two Orders Of Carne Asada Fries But Cause I Was Switching The Carne Asada With Al Pastor She Was Charging Me Extra. I’ve Never Been Charged Extra, Not At The Costco One Nor The Cathedral City One. I Walked Away Upset. A Week Has Gone By And Decided To Give Them The Benefit Of The Doubt So I Went Again Just Now And The Same Lady Messed Up My Order, I Asked For Two Simple California Burritos With Al Pastor And Another With Chicken And She Was Confused. She Was Charging Me For A Third One Of Asada Which Never Did I Mention. She Was Confused On If I Said California Or Regular And Still Kept Pushing The Third Burrito. I Clearly Made It More Clear Than Water That I Wanted Just Two Cali Burritos And I Get Home To A Surprise Of Just Two Regular Burritos. Smh. Really Disappointed At This Point. I Wont Mind Driving The Extra Mile To Cathedral City If That Means Better Service. “Cashier 13” Was The Lady.<//text>

This establishment is open 24/7, the food is good, I recommend the carne asada burrito. They have a salsa bar where you can get your salsas, diced cucumbers, chiles etc. They have lots of restaurants around the area.</Review>

<Review>Awful!  This was my second attempt to try this place as a friend told me to try something else but the food was completely flavorless and the small order of fries was giant but dripping in grease....the spicy salsa was barely a bite but had no salsa flavor.  All I can say is this place has really bland food.....I prefer not to eat fast food in general but this is by far my least favorite.< /Review>< username>

<text>I went through the drive through this morning and ordered an item off the menu. When I get to the window, the item is like $2 more than what the menu said it was. That was only topped by me getting home and having something completely inside the item than what was described as well.</text>< Pics>

Went there for my lunch break on 12/28. Took a bit too long to get my food through the drive through. As far as quality, they didnt put the wax paper under my rolled tacos so they melted the Styrofoam and the guac and sour cream on my asada nachos was watery. Overall I wont be returning to this lpcation again< /Review>

They dont cook the food, they microwave the food. Made me sick the next day. EVERY table was dirty. Absolutely terrible. Please, i urge you, do NOT waste your money here. You will not be happy and you'll wind up puking.</text>

I usually go to the desert hot springs castanedas which is excellent. Obviously I will not be going back to this one in Palm Desert near Costco . 4 of us left very unsatisfied with the food. Machaca was stringy one of the burritos was cold the other machaca also was not very good. Finally my husband's burrito wasn't anything like what he usually gets in Desert Hot Springs. Boo!<//Review>

<name>Adrian Gonzalez<//name><text>Food there is fantastic, i love everything in the menu. My only issue here is the people in charge overnight, every time we go we feel very uncomfortable because of how rude the person in charge of drive through is. It almost feels like she hates being there.  I wouldn't recommend going there at night!</text>< rating>

(Translated by Google) Good food but when ordering you have to understand perfectly what you want to eat, you wanted to enjoy a tasty lunch with a steak with crashed eggs. But they served me a rolled and dishless burrito. Without making claims I made an order again explaining well and they told me that they have steak only ground or minced meat. No grilled or grilled steak

(Original)
Comida buena pero al ordenar hay que darse a entender perfectamente lo que quieres comer tenia ganas de disfrutar un sabroso almuerzo un bistec con huevos estrellados.    Pero me sirvieron un burrito enrollado y sin plato.    Sin hacer reclamos hice  nuevamente una orden explicando bien y me dijeron que tienen bistec solo carne molida o picada.     No bistec asado ni a la plancha</Review>

I ordered online and it said it would be ready at 6:21pm. When we arrived at 6:20pm they said 10 minutes it's in the oven. Then 8 minutes, then 10 minutes and so on. We finally got our order an hour later. When we got home we noticed our boneless chicken with the sauce on the side was already mixed. Plus we were missing our 4 ranch side dressing. Also when we asked for a manager, we were  told there was only a supervisor who never came out.

DO NOT ORDER ONLINE TO PICK UP. It takes longer per staff. But when I had called on the phone tto ask a question about online orders we were not told this.

They deserve a negative 5 rating.</Text></record>

Called at 811pm asked where my pizza  was got a story about problem with one of the deliveries before me and was 2 stops away.  842pm rolls around and same person answers phone and says the pizza is done but has not gone out yet liars!!! Ask for Mgr but she was not there!!!  Finally 915 pm manager kim calls me back and is very rude and tells I could not have paid for it yet my card was charged and she could deliver the pizza or refund not both nice customer service for a 2 1/2 hr pizza with them never calling me avoid this place go to mtn Mike's  much better  service with no excuses or lies<//Text>

Worst !@#$ing store in the world, no accountability for their screw ups. Dont ever expect to get a pizza from this place in a timely manner. Oh and when you call to ask about it here comes the excuses and "manager is too busy to deal with the situation." Ordered online, never delivered an hour and half later, excuse was online system went down so my order wasnt even in yet. Get mountain Mike's, it's ready in 20-30 NO PROBLEMS. Oh and I still havent gotten my money back yet. Round table discovery bay...go fall off the planet you're worthless.<//Text>

Ordered online, never delivered or “received” 2 hours later. I have never dealt with a worse restaurant. This is the second time it’s happened and it’ll be the last.<//Text>

<Review>I ordered a "Wombo Combo" made with "creamy garlic sauce".  It is supposed to come with mushrooms, green onions and artichoke hearts -- among other things.  There were no mushrooms, no green onions and two very small pieces of artichoke.  I paid over $15.00 for a "small", and waited almost 20 minutes.  I don't really mind the wait and, while I'm not crazy about the price, it wasn't terribly excessive.  But, I'm very put out at not getting what I paid for: there really seems to be a viral incompetence infecting many franchise operations.  I won't be going back.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

I ordered a pizza online they charged my credit card and never delivered my pizza.  Not only did they not deliver my pizza they stopped answering the phone at 9:45PM 15 minutes before closing time.  I am sure they will make some excuse they never received the order.  This is the last time I will deal with them. Go Dominos!</review>

<Text>Great place to do laundry! The machines work well and more importantly they're affordable. The crowd is a nice mix of good people and the owner and staff are friendly and sincere. I will definitely be coming back again.< /Text></record>

Decent laundromat with newer machines and kept clean and tidy. But I don't think the owner has a clue as to how unfriendly this business seems with all of the warning signs everywhere and there are DOZENS of signs. Don't do this, don't touch that, it goes on and on. Also prices are rather steep but that probably goes with the location. It's fairly small so it can get crowded and with the limited number of each type of machine that can be a problem when it's busy. It's better than most since it's kept clean and the machines are maintained but it could easily be better.</text>

<GmapID>0x80deaac051276c51:0xbc11dd7fc4a3dbde</GmapID><Text>Was going through the reviews,  it looks like many good ones are faked. I also noticed the staff responses to actual customer complaints are extremely disrespectful and condescending.  **Example in photo**  The customer had clothes that didn't get clean. Owners argumentative defense is.... user error? Saying customer never started the washer? Customer didn't say clothes came out dry, they said they were still dirty.  Customer also didn't mention which machine #, or time/date she came in, How does owner even know what machine this customer was using? Or what customer they were for that matter, for there was no picture in the profile.  Seems like the owner response was meant to discredit and disrespect the customer by saying "I checked the cameras, the machine you used was never started."  Question to the Owner: How do you know what date and time this client came in? How do you know which customer made this complaint? How can you tell from the review which machine they used? Is your accusation  that they had not started the machine a complete fabrication? Do you use lies and point fingers as a defense against complaints often? smh</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1607972696454, 'text': "Chris by your review I'm curious to know if you've ever been in.

Great experience.  Mary is awesome.  All my clothes very nicely folded.  Socks and underwear folded in a separate bag.  Really nice.  Willing to be there for a pickup time that is convenient for you.  I wish I could give 10 stars!<//review>

<text>Run by unhappy people. The day lady and the male owner are the worst.  Both very rude especially to people who don't appear wealthy. I've seen them humiliate homeless people who were washing clothes, by getting all in their business telling them which machines to use, how much clothes they can put in, how much soap, etc.. obviously making this grown person uncomfortable, which i think was their goal. Lady doesn't ever enforce mask policy.  Male owner blame customers for any problems they may have.   Even on the reviews!!! Read them!!! Crazy.  After the latest batch of bs I witnessed at this place,  I won't subject myself to the negativity or bad vibe again.  :p< /text><Rate>1<//Rate><time>1611511379596< /time><Name>Cathy Smith<//Name>< GmapID>

The Owner Ross is a Awesome guy and I have been washing my clothes here since 10/2019 after moving out of Oceanside CA back to San Diego, California

The Signs are excellent and  I'd really like clean place. And price is affordable on a fixed income

I have been to a lot of dirty laundry place in California that was not clean

As for the customer Face mask police today
On Saturday 9-12-2020 and I will not wear a mask that is dirty!! And You have to keep cloth face mask or bandanas clean or to stay healthy< /Review>

<review>The place is kept fairly clean and tidy, I’ve come here a few times to do my laundry and each time there’s lack of mask wearing by both customers and employees. Makes me kind of laugh that I’ll see the employees cleaning and wiping down surfaces but then look up to see said employee have no face covering at all. Yes I get it, we all hate wearing masks, I hate it. It hurts my ears and generally I wish we didn’t have to deal with it. But there’s not much we can do about it, please wear a mask for not only my safety but everyone else’s. It’s common decency and there’s no excuse for it. There’s also zero policing, if you will, on those customers not wearing a mask. I’d say at least 50% of those who come in to do laundry are not wearing a mask or practicing social distancing, again employees included.

Aside from the mask issue, it’s not a bad laundromat. The machines are pretty new and generally clean. I’ll do a sniff check before throwing my clothes in both the washers and dryers because I will occasionally find a machine that’s musky or smells like cat p***, and avoid those machines. Otherwise I like doing my laundry here compared to the other laundromats that are closer to my home. I have gotten maybe $2 or $3 worth of dead change (counterfeit coins) over the $60 I’ve put into the change dispenser so far. But I understand that aspect is hard to control dealing with that much change. Just wish people would be more compliant with their masks. And don’t let the peer pressure of others not wearing a mask make you not want to wear yours. I can’t tell you how many times I’ll see someone go in wearing a mask to take it off halfway through because the people around them aren’t wearing one. Just keep it on people it’s not hard.

Edit: honestly y’all just go to “Wash & Go” laundry mats. They have multiple locations around the city, after finding them I’ll never go back here. There the employees actually care about wearing a mask, they clean way more diligently, and thoroughly. Machines accept credit cards and they’re way, way, way cheaper. Just go there. It took me a while to find a quality laundromat here in San Diego, but after a while I found them. Go to “wash & go” if you haven’t already tried them out.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>
{'time': 1603728671976, 'text': "Thank you Alan for the 4 star review  In which after reading your review I'm amazed but I thank you anyway We do our best with the mask situation but we can't control everyone I noticed that you came in on  Sunday and we had a lot of people from the hotels they  Don't always comply with the mask rule. Most of my regular customers put their laundry in the washer's or dryers and   And go back to their vehicles and set until their wash is done. The Sunday you came  in was a busy day And I noticed on the cameras that it got crowded a couple of times. Seeing the situation it would be advantageous to set in in your vehicle while waiting. We clean the  Machines quite often occasionly someone will bring in a dog bed and it does leave a smell as I said we try to keep  the equipment clean. As far as change machine I've never had any duds Or  bad change since I've owned the place for 7 years, Of course I don't scrutinize it the way you did, But thank you for the heads up. In closing I would say remember you are the 1st one responsible for your personal safety. Thank you again  For coming in And we hope to see you soon"}< /Response>

I like the machines here by far the best as far as newest and they have those industrial sized ones the biggest washer they have is the one that is equivalent to be able to do 8 washes i believe perfect for blankets pillows and comforters and large items that usually you have to take to the dry cleaners and pay a shirt ton, i believe the that one the largest washer costs aprox $10.00 dollars to wash one load (remember its equivalent to washing 8 loads) i think thats a fair price. They have quarter machines there and so far never have run out of quarters , the liquor store down the street on your left hand side sells laundry soap, bleach, softener all that stuff (not up the hill), there is also a 7/11 on the corner on your right hand side (just past the liquor store turn right at the light).. Happy Washing at The Blue Moon ..last load goes in at 8:00 sharp, owners watch everything since they live somewhere very close either upstaires or next door and the whole place is being monitored. That being said I feel safe going there by myself to do my laundry. If you need to use the restroom you gotta wait till one of the owners comes in cus only they have the key to unlock it, that being said you can use their restrroom if u are doing your laundry there and everything from the lightswitch to the soap to the hand towel in the bathroom are all hands free which was nice. Overall for a laundry matt its too small and crampy with no room to fold and no table space big enough for more people then 2 at a time in my humble opinion. Everything else is great. Just I personally like to fold while im at the laundry matt to me thats when the folding and everything to do with laundry takes place if i dont get the folding done at the laundry matt my clothes just wont get folded ....but thats just me.😉< /Review>< pics>

<review>The Owners are superb! They are friendly and helpful. The gentleman educated me on the different machines and what is considered a load for them. He actually saved me about $13 that I was seconds away from inserting into some of his machines and essentially his pockets.  That's Awesome customer service and for that reason alone I tell everyone I can about Blue Moon and it's WONDERFUL OWNERS.<//review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
The male owner of this place is extremely dishonest and hostile to customers with complaints or issues online or in person.  I keep reading his responses that say "I got it on my audio visual recording that YOU were the problem" so extremely juvenile and I know completely false. After reading these reviews/responses, I know (also from my personal negative interactions with him in person) he lies about the event in his response online, reshaping the truth so he comes out the victor.< /review>

<Text>I have a small list of items that gave me the reason to do 1 star (which I try to not always do):
1. The worst parking setup, in front the spots are super small and in back I was afraid to be towed because nothing said "Laundromat Parking"...I crammed my Denali in front.
2. I walked in to find no staff here to help me, just a phone number plastered high up on the wall.
3. The price, all loads are $3.50 - $10.00 but in no way is it worth it. The only thing reasonable are the $.25 dryers.
4. The amount of signs, in no way does this place seem friendly or helpful (a fellow customer had to help me because I have been here for an hour now and nobody who works here has come in).
I do not recommend this place, go to the laundromat in Pacific Beach.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAtU_49odwFqsUoJw5L3Kj9YEl0Ah5XWk8gYES=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1547140308867, 'text': "Well good morning desert Walker Some laundromats don't have much parking at all  We have 21 spaces parking in the rear 2.

< Review>
The overall laundry is clean and nice. Mary and Russ are very sweet and accommodating. This place is the only place we go to, however the lady that works here on the weekends is RUDE!!  As we sat waiting for our laundry a gentleman asked if she could unlock the bathroom she said very loudly NO IM NOT ON THE CLOCK! But yet she had been running around doing laundry and back and forth in the office. I would have loved to give this place five stars except for her. She walks around with such a mean face everyone is afraid to ask her to unlock the bathroom or for any kind of assistance. She needs some training in customer service. If she’s so unhappy working here (that’s what she acts like) then she should go somewhere else.< /Review>

1. The worst parking setup, in front the spots are super small and in back I was afraid to be towed because nothing said "Laundromat Parking"...I crammed my Denali in front.
2. I walked in to find no staff here to help me, just a phone number plastered high up on the wall.
3. The price, all loads are $3.50 - $10.00 but in no way is it worth it. The only thing reasonable are the $.25 dryers.
4. The amount of signs, in no way does this place seem friendly or helpful (a fellow customer had to help me because I have been here for an hour now and nobody who works here has come in).
I do not recommend this place, go to the laundromat in Pacific Beach.< /text>

<UserId.>103479034594890430185</UserId.><text>WARNING - DO NOT WASH CLOTHES HERE

The owner became enraged after allowing my clothing to sit in the washer for an additional 5 minutes after the washing cycle completed.

When I reentered the store to place my clothes in the dryer, the owner aggressively approached me accusing me of leaving my clothing unattended for 45 minutes. He proceeded to call me a liar when I refuted his statement. He subsequently began yelling and acting irate, almost knocking his hearing aid loose.

I attend the University of San Diego, which sits directly across the street from this establishment. Laundry locations are plentiful around campus, but I opted to support local business instead. That was clearly a mistake.

UPDATE: The owner responded with fabricated lies. He clearly lacks integrity, and I highly suggest avoiding this place.<//text>< resp>

Best laundromat I have found on the north side. Cheapest wash is 2.50, dryers give 8 minutes per quarter which is fantastic. soap is .75¢ per box, also cheap. Open bathroom and 6, count them, SIX outlets to charge devices. Fast, free wifi. This place only loses a star because it's a bit dirty, the floor has that old-school look of a layer of permagrime that will never mop out (the machines, however, are clean and mostly new). Another plus: the manager actually answers his phone and is frequently present. Recommended.</Text>

I agree about parking being..odd..  The quarter machine on the washer needed some coaxing but eventually worked out okay.  Owner was onsite the whole time keeping the place clean and running. I did not feel the clientele would try to run off with my underwear haha.  Would go back.< /text>

The owner of this business is a COMPLETE FREAK! I was there maybe 10 minutes when he walked in and started harassing another customer. He proceeded to kick that person out. Then he turns to me and starts yelling at ME to get out. There was no reason given. Absolutely obnoxious owner, i hope he goes out of business soon!< /text>

<Text>Great center nice gym awesome library.  Perfect for the community nicely located but the parking lot is on the small side. Really like the sculpture on the s side of the building.  Audio recording of the hawk eating the pigeon is a bit off putting.<//Text>< user_id>

<rating>4< /rating><text>Small community center with a small gym, attached to a city library branch. You may hear a recorded screeching noise in the outdoor, covered entrance area. I assume that is to scare birds away.

Parking lot is small, covered in solar panels to shade cars. This is the most recently built community center in the city of San Jose, I believe. It's only a few years old. Located right by streetlight records.

Check out an Energy-smart kit at the library! It has free items to save energy at your home, including to keep: low flow shower head, light bulbs, low-flow sink filter, etc. It also contains items to return, such as a kill-a-watt meter, you can check how much energy your appliances are using.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Very nice facility with everything in one: library, gym, workout space, etc.  I wish all cities had this kind of centralized community center instead of disparate buildings in parks.</text>

< Review>
I play in an indoor volleyball league here. The floor is nice (hardwood) and the ceiling is high, but the air conditioning SUCKS (not even dure if the have an a/c) and there are sooo many lines on the floor, making it confusing which ones are the right ones for the volleyball court.</Review>

<Text>Visited the newly opened Bascom Branch Library now that the Grand Opening hype has died down.  Instead opted to come on a Family Activity night to check it out after work and what a treat it was.  While the Family activity event is geared towards younger kids, maybe 2-5, the overall atmosphere was fantastic for a Wednesday evening.  The librarians were helpful, knowledgeable and friendly and not at all disconnected like several i have met at other libraries we frequent.

The facilities are amazing, with a grand attrium as we entered leading to the community center/fitness center on one side and teh Library on the other.  Inside, the library was mostly spacious and well lit at night.  A safe children's area fo rthe young ones, a dedicated teen room, computers in the tech center and both quiet study and group study rooms surround the the main stacks in the middle.

Overall a fantastic new library that we will be visiting regularly!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

The restaurant is small. The food was decently good. They provide handmade tortillas which is a plus. Personally the rice and beans is okay and do think it can be improved. Overall great service and the servers are attentive to their clients.<//review>

Small family owned restaurant looks run down, but always clean.  Food is always great!   Authentic Mexican food, great tasty salsas, fresh home made chips and tortillas!  Daily fresh Mexican coffee and  pan dulce.  They offer homemade aguas frescas everyday.   I like coming here for Mexican food!👍🏼< /text>

<Review>I recently had some car battery issues while I was filling up at the Arco station near O'Reilly's.  I must say I was blow away by the young man Ryan who works here. He quickly came out to my car, and was able to diagnose the problem. It was not the alternator or the battery (just yet) but rather the battery hook up and some corrosion damage.  His gracious attitude and kindness to fit the problem himself saved me time and money.  I will be back to. Thank you Ryan!

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Curtis is the best person in this shop. I am new to the car maintenance area, and wanted help in explaining each type of liquid a car needs. He took the time to explain everything, and in detail. Because of him, I understand everything regarding liquids now. He was straightforward, unlike all the explanations online which make understanding car liquids impossible to fully understand. He deserves a promotion / raise.< /Review>< pics>

Kudos to Curtis. We drove across the desert in 115 degree heat and our car was overheating.  Curtis looked at our car, determined it was low on coolant and helped us fill it up. He then gave us an extra gallon of water just in case. Great customer service! Thank you!< /Review>

So theyre some really knowledgeable people and friendly. I always get top notch service and answers. Dont be scared of asking for a discount if you go in often. They do always tell you about the deals or offers that are going on. I really reccomend going to this store.< /Text>

All religions have temples where people can gather together to contemplate on God and pray. The Sikh temple is called a Gurdwara. The word 'Gurdwara' means 'Gateway to the Guru'. In Sikhism ones personal dedication to living a good life is important but another important aspect of Sikhism is the Sangat (congregation). Not only should one meditate on God on their individual level but also on a corporate level. There are thousands of Gurdwaras throughout Punjab and the rest of the world. They serve as community centers for the Sikh's. There are no restrictions on who may enter a Gurdwara for prayer. People of all religions are welcome to attend. Another common feature of all Gurdwaras around the world is Langar, the free community kitchen. Here food is served to all people who sit together to enjoy a communal meal. It is a symbol of the Sikh belief in a non-sexist, non-racist society where all people of all casts, religions are equal and can share a common meal in the true spirit of unity.<//review>

<Review>Super simple process to get my pup in! We needed a last minute reservation and they were very easy to work with. It was our first time dropping our girl off at a daycare and didn’t know what to expect. She definitely could smell fun in the air as she raced in without looking back! She came back home and slept in the same position for 3 hours straight and was exhausted (in a good way of course). We will definitely be bringing her back.</Review>< gmapID>

<review>When I found myself searching for a new dental office, I was naturally worried that I would have to go through several trials before finding the right one. I happened upon Casa Dental on Yelp, which rated high and came very highly recommend in the reviews, so I gave it a try. I'm sure glad I did because I couldn't be happier and I've been with them since. The building and offices are very clean, the staff is courteous and friendly, and they really do a great job in taking care of your dental/oral health. I'm happy that they are open for business amidst all the business closures (due to the pandemic) so I can get my dental cleaning. To the Covid-cautious crowd, rest assured that their team takes the proper measures and precautions to keep clients safe. I just had my dental cleaning and will be returning to replace a very old silver filling with white composite - Yay! Lockdown life gets so boring that a dental appointment has become a welcome activity.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgdL1xBO3Krx8zXeMB7qGj6GknxKu7c0LNdYz8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCGtCjx-luqInZhpAtnrDaGkJXKJj9K3VE_Wzc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw4QYzsHNWdfzs_6-NnXyiIX30do60DzX2chLa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNw0a2almeBOc1yPmRHPmngkgxDaaScnH6tCQMH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

I want to give a special shout out to Desiree! Everytime I see her she gives off a very welcoming attitude and is not only focused on me but my puppy too. The stores she shares about what my dog does are very helpful and something I always looked to look forward to when picking up my dog. Once again, Thank you Desiree and the world needs more people like you ❤< /review>

I don't know where to start because I have so many good things to say! We had our first visit this week (which was a free temperament test to make sure the dog is non-aggressive), and I was really blown away by my experience. Not only is the website awesome (you create an account and can purchase packages, make visit reservations, view photos/updates of your dog, etc.), but everyone I interacted with was so kind and dog-loving, and it was clear from chatting with them that they all had met and interacted with my dog that day.

The report card for his temperament test was really detailed and so sweet and positive. Made me really proud of my pup. :) They included a bunch of pictures as well so I could see how he was doing and other dogs he was meeting. The next day they also posted a welcome message on their Facebook account with a collage of my dog! Such a cute extra touch.

Before coming here, I had been becoming more and more uncomfortable with taking my dog to the dog park (I've seen some really sketchy things go down there, including when a dog tried to kill another dog!). So I really appreciate how strict they are about vaccinations and with requiring a temperament test for every new dog. It makes me feel more comfortable knowing that every dog my boy will interact with has been vetted!

The only minor complaint I have was that my pup has smelled fairly strongly of perfume for the last few days since his visit... Although, since this likely means he was getting lots of love from a staff member, I suppose I can't complain too much! :)

Planning to start taking my little guy here weekly- would recommend to anyone!< /text>

I brought both of my pups here for care and I absolutely loved that I was able to pick them up as soon as I was free instead of having to wait until the next day to pick them up. Both of them were so happy and I loved that I got a report card for both dogs and I was able to read about their day, personalities and traits from staff. Will absolutely continue to use them< /Review>

<Text>This was my first time being away from our dog for such a long period time. I was worried about her missing me too much. When I received the progress  report mid day and she was smiling, running and enjoying herself, my concerns were put to rest. It was an amazing experience for our dog Cake. It definitely will not be the last time. Loved it!

Everything about 24 Hour was very well done. I especially loved the daily Report Card that included several pictures of my boy, Bullet. It put my heart at ease seeing him looking fine & healthy as well as making my relatives & me smile. I have to include in this that I realize my boy wasn’t the best guest by being stressed & crying (you said “howling “), but, I think he reverted to shelter mentality mode as we adopted him from a shelter when he was 3 & they had no knowledge of his previous life. Also, not leaving his property for a year didn’t help that insecurity. I think 24 Hour did an exceptional job helping him through that insecurity. A bonus is that the facility is open 24 hours. Thank you to the Staff!<//review>

First time here with my girl Mona who is a 5 year old German shepherd. She was verry happy and we'll cared for. My favorite thing about this place was the report card at the end that tells you how the day went and the friends she made throughout the day. The photos are also great to see. It made me feel happy and greatfull to know I can bring her here any time of the day and pick up at any time as well. With work haveing long hours at times I know I can bring her some place safe where I know she will be care for and treated well. Thank you 24 Hour Dog Daycare and we will see you again soon!!< /Review>

<time>1620691371814< /time><rating>5< /rating><Review>My son rescued a sweet 1 year old pup that was chained outside for his first year in the desert, showing some fear of men, almost a month ago. Brian was very flexible considering it’s not ideal for such a newly adopted dog but Pak has spent the past few weeks going to dog parks, skateparks and having play dates with my son’s friends who have dogs. It’s amazing that the facility offers the first play date as an orientation and completely free should you leave your pet for a minimum of four hours. Just like Caesar Milan does on the “Dog Whisperer” show, our pup was separated watching the rest of the pack play to have his reaction monitored, keeping everyone safe. Once he showed no aggression, he was introduced to the rest of the dogs where he eventually overcame his shyness and had a blast playing. This 40 lb Shepherd mix barks like a full-grown police dog, though it’s meant to be playful, it can be intimidating but obviously these are professionals who knew the difference. I received a report card after a couple hours with adorable pictures of Pak getting acclimated and making friends. It will even be posted on their Facebook page tomorrow which is so fun for my son to see while he’s away on a business trip. We are going back on Wednesday because this Nana loves the idea of help with that pup’s energy level. The prices are more than reasonable and the staff couldn’t be anymore friendly, professional and amazing dog people. We are happy to be added to their wonderful pack!< /Review>< pics>

My girls were scared upon arrival they have not been to a doggie hotel before. But they were satisfied with the staff. They took good care of my dogs and even gave them a bath so I could pickup clean dogs! I recommend to anyone that has to find a crew in a crunch, they are attentive and we got report cards (with pictures of happy dogs), daily. Many thanks!< /Review>

<text>Loki has been going here for 2 months now. I was looking for a place to exert his puppy energy, and they did not disappoint!  He whines as we start getting close, and literally drags me to the front door to play with his fur buddies! The staff is fantastic, and I can tell by the way he greets them, he is well taken care of and loved. I enjoy viewing FB pics, where you see them enjoying their day!<//text></record>

<text>We truly appreciate that there is a 24/7 doggie daycare/boarding. When we require a service on the East side of this region, 24 Hour Dog Daycare is convenient. Some ideas for improvement: 1) make sure all employees keep dogs secure when customer picks up, i.e., do not let dog lose until owner has securely put collar/leash back on; 2) lobby is cold and unfriendly; 3) your outdoor signage is hard to see. Why not light it up?</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Text>We are a military family who were stuck in a pickle trying to get our dog to Hawaii.  We chose to board him here for 3 weeks before the pet travel service could pick him up to fly him to us in Hawaii. One of the best decisions we have ever made!! The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, responsive. They have been so wonderful, loving, and caring with our dog in the time we were unable to care for him.  We received report cards every other day (and photos) detailing his activities, demeanor, and days spent there.  During an already stressful time for us as a family, 24 Hour Doggy Day Care of Escondido helped to eliminate that additional stress and concern when it came to our pooch! We simply can’t recommend them enough or find the words to a say enough good things about the facility and staff!!  Don’t hesitate in choosing them, they are BY FAR the BEST!!!< /Text></record>

We needed a weekend option for Max close to work for me. He'd not yet been to an open play facility so I was nervous but Max did fine. I had a hard time getting him to leave at pick up! The report card is a great feature. We brought Max to his regular dog daycare about a week later & you could tell the difference in how much better he responded to the environment at 24 hour dog daycare 💜< /Text>

I love this daycare! I was very nervous about letting someone care for my pups but they are the best. At first I wasn’t sure about not having cameras but I love that I can focus on work and know that they are in good hands! Martini and Tito are big fans!< /review>

<review>I like it but there's no outside area or turf for the dogs unless you pay extra for a walk which makes if feel a little sterile. I do like that they do strict behavior tests before your dog can stay and send you pics after daycare which makes me feel like my fur baby is safe.< /review><Rating>4</Rating><date>1601067282142<//date><resp>{'time': 1601418854154, 'text': 'Hey Jessica! Thank you so much for taking time to share your experience with others 😁 There seems to be a slight misunderstanding. We keep track when dogs pee & poo with forms and if they do not relieve themselves we walk them outside for a potty break as a courtesy. The walks you mention are the extended walks if you want them to have a walk longer than just a potty walk. Or simply because you want them to explore the area and spend even more one-on-one time with the staff!'}</resp>< userid>

Me and my husband were in a bind and are greatful we found this place. Riley was so happy when we left. It was nice, because she has a lot of energy, so she needed a place where she can run, play and have fun with other dogs. The people were very nice and let me know how she did. When we got home, she slept like a baby because she was so tired. Definitely will bring her back when we need a doogy sitter.< /Text>

<Review>This place is amazing! They are very professional, loving, caring, thorough, diligent, genuine and just overall wonderful people who treat your pet like their own! Great place for your fur baby, especially coming from a household of law enforcement and nursing careers the unpredictable schedules that come with those job, 24HDDC is very flexible and accommodating. I wouldn’t send my dog anywhere else, I never have to worry about my fur baby when he is there! They also take wonderful pictures throughout the day to keep you informed on your fur babies day! Now they just need to open one in the Temecula area!</Review>< Pictures>

So amazing! OUTSTANDING communication! Our puppy didn’t know how to play with other dogs and these guys really helped him but while he was warming up they gave him extra love so he wasn’t sad! We got progress reports nightly WITH pictures!!! Every “extra service” like extended dog walk or ice cream (we spoiled) they sent another report with photos! It was so nice! They were awesome!!< /text>

{'time': 1579907935482, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your candid review, Debra!\nIt was such an honor and a pleasure to have Honey Bun here with us. She is truly one energetic puppy and loves people and dogs alike! We certainly can’t wait to see her again in the future and watch her blossom and grow. The first time ever going to a doggy daycare with group play can be a lot for certain puppies, for sure! If you have the privilege, you can slowly start socializing her with friend/family dogs and as she becomes comfortable you can increase the number of dogs. Once you feel she is ready for the next step, you can try her out at a local dog park that separates the dogs by size. Exposure to that number of dogs can help our pup gain confidence in themselves, learn social cues, and develop their own playstyle. Honey Bun is an amazing fast learner and we are sure she will do wonderfully!\nBest Wishes,\nArielle N.'}</response>

Our dog is a 5 month old puppy and we feel she wo do better if she were older and a little bigger. Staff are great and it seemed clean and well taken care of but honestly the pictures of our dog playing with the others concerned us as it appeared she was irritated with the other dogs. It is fair to say she has not had a great deal of socialization with other dogs so perhaps that could add to our impressions. We plan on trying them again in the future<//text>

It is also really conveniently located right next to the freeway and I love the fact that they are open 24/7.

With the gentle help and loving care of the staff at 24 Hour, Zsa Zsa now looks forward to her time at the daycare! It's such a relief to know she feels secure there and trusts the situation.

<Review>The guy was super cool and helpful.no rudeness at all. There reason I'm giving it 3 stars is because their juice variety was very small. And I mean VERY! Don't get me wrong though this place has a lot of potential. Also I agree with that the other guy said about the testers, it's true.</Review>< Pictures>

Service is cool but the testers suck seems like they barely work. Where ever they get there juice from suck has no flavor what so ever. The prices are high. I'm not going back.</Review>

Over priced, one day companies will understand, if you want to convert smokers, try to make the pricing competitive to cigs. You can get everything they sale at other local places for much cheaper!<//Review>

<text>I came into this vape shop for the first time. They told me the prices for 3 bottles of juices was $30. When they rang me up, it came out to be $39. That means they ridiculously charge 30% for tax here. I told them that tax in Highland is not this high. They didn't seem to care and decided to charge me it anyways. Don't let them scam you.< /text><Rating>1</Rating><time>1436909253548< /time><pictures>None<//pictures><gmap_id>0x80c355180c9591cb:0x411d4cc73d11d2e3<//gmap_id>< username>

This vape shop is the best, friendly employees who are very knowledgeable. I go here regularly for all my vaping needs, ive had more than one occurance where being down to my last 10-15$ they have worked with me to help me get my vape juice. Either by just dropped 5$ off one of their bottles or one time the manager even gifted me a bottle of their house juices which are really good to be honest. This place is the best i highly recommend going here for any and all vape needs</text>

Customer service is is our top priority so I’m not sure what went wrong but I do apologize for that. As for pricing, we’ve recently lowered our prices to compete with the market. Yes our prices are the lowest but yet they aren’t the highest. We hope you give our business another chance and keep in mind that we also do price match.\n-Ace of Vapes (Highland)'}<//Resp>< time>

Friday oct 27 12:30 luch time
Clean dining area and restroom
Fast attentive cashiers and kitchen staff
Delicious food. Seriously the number 12 combo. chicken something soo good.
AND its located just opposite of the Malibu Pier. So convenient and easy to spot. My one concern is the parking. What the heck only space for 12 cars that includes the handicap spot. Aside from that the only other thing to note is the dining area. It's split in 2 one is on the inside and the other outside interesting. It's good to have a choice and decide between indoor dining and soaking up some sun while eating tasty burgers.
Absolutely recommend this Jack in the box.</Review>

One of the best Jack in the Boxes! Friendly and capable staff that always kept a clean store before COVID-19, and now adheres strictly to the new, enhanced sanitation protocols, which I really appreciate.< /Review>

Very fast inconvenient and they don't get mad at when you change your world right at the window at the last minute like I did the last time I was there. Definitely 5 stars in 2 thumbs up.  :^ ></Review>

< review>
This place used to be a 5 star fast food place. I remember years ago my bread was always fluffy. The condiments were proportional my burger looked like the one in the picture. I have been to this location for over 8 years everytime i would visit malibu i would stop here. From my last experience . I doubt ill go after covid 19 . If the same management still operates it. I didnt even get napkins. I remember when you guys are wore ties even the cook. It wasnt even busy when i went just a car in front of me and a pick up truck. My longest review by far cause this one did hurt when the service went out. And get getter head sets in the drive trough we are in Malibu .</review>

This place is great! It is very reasonably priced for the location and the food is good too. Located on the end of the Malibu pier, this restaurant has indoor, outdoor, and rooftop seating with panoramic ocean views. The atmosphere is causal and laid back. You order at the counter and the food is brought to your table. In my experience the food came out very quickly. The only negative is the lack of parking (street or expensive lot), so it is best to make it part of a Malibu beach day. With the prime location, good food, and reasonable prices, I can’t think of a better lunch spot in the area. (The picture is the fried egg sandwich)

SO god damn yummy. My mother and I have been here multiple times, and it’s always fantastic. There’s a great selection and the view is amazing. Highly highly recommend! (My favorite menu items are the breakfast burrito and the Swedish pancakes!)

Food was so fresh and delicious! Great location and ambiance. The service was great and all of the food options were healthy but each of my friends and I (total 6) were all very happy with our dishes. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is in the Malibu area!

This place is always packed when I come but I always find somebody leaving as I am entering the parking lot and because of that I don't have to worry about looking for parking elsewhere or go through the drive thru its a little small for a Jack in the Box but it serves its purpose

Watch out when you exit the parking lot as everybody goes fast<//text>

<review>Very run-down and dirty. They obviously don't spend anything keeping the premises up. Food was typical Jack in the Box: burgers and fries were tasty, and the tacos were exceptionally greasy. If there were anywhere else to go for the same money, we would have. But, there's not much else around, except an equally lousy KFC, so we went here.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<name>Miki Martinez</name>< Review>
The kitchen was filthy. The shake machine was crusted,  looked like it hadn't been clean in ages.  The dining room floor had trash all over,  the tables were not cleared after customers. My daughter and I ordered the chicken strip meal. My chicken was over cooked to the point that it was impossible to chew.  I asked for ranch,  the two cups (pre-sealed) I received had separated and had pools if oil or something on top,  when I opened them. I  received incorrect change. I chose not to bring my food complaints to the attention of the employees, for the fear of my food being altered.< /Review>

I can with unwavering confidence say that this particular Jack in the Box sits far above any other I have ran into in my 30ish years living here in earth. The food was top notch and served with a smile. I've stop here every time I find myself stuck in Malibu for some reason or another and every time for the five years kr maybe more the same cashier helps me out with a smile and a welcoming feeling as I order. This is also the most cost effective way to cure what pains any empty stomach which is a godsend due to all other restaurants easily ten times as much and probably only half as good.</text>

Fast food with an ocean view , I'll take it. The best thing about this was the ability to park and sit and watch the sunset over the ocean. Food was horrible!< /Text>

This jack in the box was small and relatively dirty as far as fast food restaurants go.  Food was good so drive thru would be the way to go.</text>

< review>
Came here because I had a craving for curly fries. The second we walked in, I really wanted to walk out. The inside of the restaurant was smelly and dirty, it just feels really gross even just standing inside the restaurant. Probably one of the worst fast food outlets I've been. We won't be back.< /review>

This place needs to be shut down by the health department.It was the worst place,from the minute you walked in it was smelly and felt like a prison the bathrooms didn't have paper towels or soap.The staff were completely clueless of what they were doing.There was 6 people in the restaurant and a25 minute wait for every person. We didn't order just left.</review>

Service was horrible. It took 25 minutes for some nuggets. They were out of just about everything in the soda machine, what was there tasted horrible. On top of that, the place was filthy.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Good burger - room not very clean!
Located just in front of the Pier, small car park but which is released quickly.
Unfriendly reception, here it's the performance that counts!
The room is not very clean, given the heavy traffic of customers it might be a good idea to clean the room more often!
Too bad because the burger was just excellent!
Sign that I will remember but not that of Malibu :(

(Original)
Bon burger – salle pas très propre !
Situé juste en face du Pier, petit parking mais qui se libère rapidement.
Accueil peu aimable, ici c’est le rendement qui compte !
La salle ne fait pas très propre, compte-tenu d’un passage important de clients il serait peut-être judicieux de nettoyer la salle plus souvent !
Dommage car le burger était juste excellent !
Enseigne que je vais gardé en mémoire mais pas celui de Malibu :(< /text>

(Translated by Google) It's not just a fast-food restaurant any less. I was close but I did not have anything to eat (because I would not pay for a seaside restaurant).
