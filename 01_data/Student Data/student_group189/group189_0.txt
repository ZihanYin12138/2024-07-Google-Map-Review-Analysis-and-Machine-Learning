<Text>We took our pup to get neutered and the next morning we find him with his backside covered in blood and his sac completely filled with blood. On top of that the vet also cut his nails way too short, you can tell that they had no care at all and just cut right through all his littles nerves.< /Text>< GmapID>

< review>
Wouldn't take my pets here if you love and truly care for them. Staff is not very attentive or helpful, I've taken 2 of my cats to get spayed/fixed and each came back traumatized. No longer wanted to be around people, afraid to be handled/petted, some sort of extreme anxiety when they weren't like that prior to being fixed. Not only that but after the procedure they just seemed very off. I really thought my cat was going to die. For one of them they left some sort of stitches or something. I could tell it bothered her so I took her to a different vet to get that removed and they were so shocked they just left them there.

Idk what goes on in there after you drop off your pets but never again. I'd rather pay tons more for actual quality and sincere compassion for my animals.</review>

Otherwise good service, reasonable prices, clinic is super small, I like that they don't try and run all these crazy tests. Just the basics. Been coming here for 10 years with cats and dogs, always left satisfied.

They really need 2 people working and- in a bigger office.<//text>< pics>

<review>I wish they would have gave me pain and sedation pills for my baby girl after being spayed. She opened her wound the next day because they used the glue and cone method only which works for low energy dogs, and I told them she was high energy. In my person experience they are nice people and good to the pets, but they have way to many pets and cant have the vet or the vet tech talk to you about things you need because of number of people they have. Thank you though so much for doing a good job at the surgery, the after care you proved though is not good enough though.</review><response>None<//response><date>1610513500157<//date><gmapID>0x80dd2b37c8116daf:0xcf679d33cf2405b7<//gmapID></record>

Hello animal lovers of which I am one.  I found this animal clinic to be very fast with attending to coustomers, friendly service and knowledgeable. They are busy and I would recomend you get there early on Tuesday mornings 9:00 to 9:30 the line starts and they open at 10: sharp. I recommend Tuseday because I've found its the least busy. They are opened on Saturday and you can call for appointment but not always able to get through I would again recommend to call around 12:00 noon it's the best time to get through. Sounds to complicated well believe me you want to try this clinic you wont believe the incredible unbelievable low prices at this clinic you will save a whole lot of money compared to other animal clinics around. I didn't believe it myself until I took my kitty there. Try it for yourself and see. Bye bye 😄 and be good to your furry babies and other pet you might have. ❤😊<//review>

I brought my dog here 2 weeks ago for a 2nd opinion because her vet wanted to amputate her leg to remove a tumor.  I'm glad I brought her here because Dr. Lopez was able to remove the growth without amputating the leg.  And the cost is much less than the price the other vet wanted to charge me.  Found a new vet for my dog.<//text>

< Review>
Have always taken my dogs and cats to this vet prices reasonable until I brought my kitten I adopted from the shelter.  It was sneezing so the vet gave him an allergy shot. Poor thing eyes were dilated for a few days and was constantly hyper and could not sleep.  I called the vet to ask what medication was given and they had no idea because they never wrote it down in the medical record. Now I take my pets to a different vet. I would rather pay more somewhere else so that pets are safe< /Review>

Thank you Melvyn for your kind greeting that morning!
Thank you Dr Lopez for your love and compassion during our visit on that horrifying morning.

<review>Euthanasia prices are very competitive, but you get what you pay for. The staff seems to be compassionate and caring, but the vet, Nick Lopez is pretty cold, rushed and business as usual. They use a single dose to get the job done. Other places use a sedative first to ease the pet into the final moments. Another thing is the vet doused the pets hand in alcohol, not allowing enough time to dry. My pet endured pain when the needle pierced his skin. Then he performed a bolus injection. The experience was over before I knew what happened.<//review></record>

Good place if you have a minor problem. If your dog has a heart condition or other serious issue they wont look into it. They dont have the technology and not sure they know what to do. They have great prices, again if your pet has a real issue go elsewhere.<//Review>

<Review>I have taken around 20 cats here (most feral) for spay/neuter and I have not had any problems. They are extremely affordable and have never tried to price gouge me like other vets in the area. They only have one exam room, which can cause a bit of a wait, but I think that's what keeps their overhead down, which in turn keeps their prices down. The vets there seem to be very knowledgeable, I'd even venture to say even more knowledgeable than some of the pricey vets in the area. The receptionist is very kind and friendly and so are the vet techs. I don't have any complaints and I would recommend this clinic to my family and friends.< /Review><user_name>Leslie S<//user_name><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

<text>Love Dr. Johnny and the staff. Saved my Boxer from Parvo years ago and have been coming back since with new dogs.  They are very reasonable and attentive.  You end up waiting because it’s only walk-in appointments but they’re worth it.</text>< Pics>

They 're fast friendly and Affordable.
The only issue I run a cross is trying to call them with the cell phone they provided, or their voicemail is not set up and/or it's full so they don't have a good way to call & speak to someone in person. When I have left messages in the past they don't return any of the multiple calls I left on the voicemail. Also they don't have website up to contact them an alternative way via email or 2nd business line so you're better off going in person during business hours posted. If they are out to lunch between 1-2 then you should wait outside in the chairs until they get back since they tend to get packed pretty quickly & it's a smaller waiting room to sit inside the building.<//Text>

This is a great clinic. I highly recommend it :) I used to take my previous pets and my current one to my previous veterninaian clinic which has been in a time frame of over 6 years. For the last 3 of those 6 I have taken my little boy since he was 2 months old wen I first got him. I recently have switched over to this clinic. When I first came to this clinic they were very friendly and made me feel at ease right away. I loved the fact that they asked me if wanted to be in the room with my baby while he was getting his yearly up to date vaccinations rather than just taking him from me and bringing him back when they are finished. They were tentative to both my feelings and that to the feelings of my baby, also they saved me a bundle. Not only did I pay literally half of what I had previously paid at my old clinic, they also told me that on the list of procedures I brought with me for his yearly renewal of vaccinations were not even necessary saving me even more. And when ever I have needed anything from this clinic they have done what they can to make sure that I get it. I needed my dog's past medical records from my old clinic and had the hardest time trying to obtain them and when I called here they got them to me with no problem.<//text>

The only this place is good for is for shots for ur animals.
The only reason I went in there yesterday was because my Dog was bleeds from her mouth to the point I had blood all over the inside of my car.
The bleeding stopped when the so call Vet put paper towels in her mouth.. this was about 5:10 pm.
Then he said sorry I can do anything more because we close at 6pm.. what an Ahole.
Reason people go there is because he's cheap.
I'll never go back to this assbite.
Good luck to a guy that only cares about the money and no heart for animals</Review>

The dr was amazing with my puppy and answered all the questions I asked. The receptionist is very nice and pleasant to talk to. Their adoption/re-homing employee was very nice and helped to ease my concerns. Their prices are very affordable and its nice to see people who care so much about animals and helping them verses trying to make a fortune on treating them.</Text>

As other reviews have said, don't judge a book by it's cover. The location is a little sketchy, the shopping center is in need of a facelift and the animal clinic is a little small, but the service was EXCELLENT.
From a referral, I took my cat there for treatment for an abscessed tooth.  Two other clinic’s quoted me $730 and $575.  I was shocked when the Vet quoted me $120, even included the follow-up antibiotic’s.

Being a walk-in, I expected a long wait and the typical shuffle routine, but it was surprisingly quick.  While sitting there, I did notice a lapse in attention to the phone, and when they did answer, they were a little short / brief with the customer.  I quess this was due to no Receptionist on duty.  The two Doctors fielded their own calls. That to me was great, speaking directly to the Vet and it keeps the costs down.

Regardless of the price though, I needed to be assured of quality service and care.  My cat normally doesn’t do well with vet’s, but was calm throughout the exam, the staff was really nice and seemed very genuine.  The doctor was super great, informative and earnest.  The doctor made me feel completely comfortable leaving our beloved Mojo there.  They had her in an out in only a few hours and everything looked perfectly fine.

Oh, throughout the entire procedure, it was evident that the Doctors were devoted to animals, and the staff were animal lovers. This is a great place that will care for your animals and you won't have to pay an arm and a leg.  I'm so thankful to have found this place!<//Text>

Its got good prices, but very unorganized and needs to be rearranged. Some isles are very small and can't fit more than one person, and usually only one checker.< /text>

<date>1599527839383< /date><text>After driving from San Diego up to Paso Robles we pulled off the road and discovered this lovely little town of Arroyo Grande. Hungry and ready for a glass of wine, we stumbled upon the Rooster Creek Tavern. The outdoor seating was socially distanced and clean and we settled in. We got the margarhita pizza and a local glass of wine. The service was impeccable, the pizza was delicious with those perfectly sweet Italian tomatoes and fresh basil on top of a delicious crust. A very pleasant surprise and great dinner break after driving all day!</text></record>

Very knowledgeable staff. I do not currently own a gun and have been looking to get one. They answered all my questions showed me some cool product and carry lots of ammo. They really help me with the decision on the purchase. Highly recommend.</text>

I've bought a few guns from here and had great customer service. If I could I would give them 6 stars. Always friendly. Very knowledgeable.
Now the best part. They were able to find a rifle that other shops couldn't.
Thanks Jim!  Customer for life.<//review>

<text>Bought a pump action shotgun that had to be ordered.   The process was as quick as can be in California.   Everyone in the shop was professional and knowledgeable.

< Review>
Just purchased my first firearm. I wanted to shop a small local business as opposed to one of the large sporting good stores, and I'm glad I did. This place is top notch. They have a great selection and the staff was phenomenal. Mike was fantastic in helping me pick the perfect gun for my needs. He showed me several rifles, showed me how they all worked, and was able to answer every question. Every single person working there from the staff to the owners are wonderful. Even the regular customers were very welcoming and friendly. It's a family run shop and they treat you like family. I will definitely be going back to Roosters for my next gun.</Review>

<review>BEST IN THE WEST.  I had the best experience at Roosters.  Great knowledgeable staff, super courteous and friendly!  Prices are good and best of all, great inventory.  It’s hard to find a gun store thats Fun for a girl to shop in, but Roosters definitely goes out if their way to make everyone feel safe and welcome.</review>< rating>

Nice place.  Been meaning to stop buy for a while.  Voodoo Tactical distributor, so they have every bag they make in stock , it seems.  Also, Black Rifle Coffee Company distributor, so they have a FULL selection of product, including in K-Cups.</Review>

<Review>Best firearm prices on the central coast (I paid  $20 under MSRP which on the central coast is unfortunately unheard of, usually its $100 over MSRP!!). Really friendly staff who obviously love what they do. Really professional operation, makes buying a gun feel like buying a car (in a good way). They do all the paperwork in a nice office in the back. Really large selection of firearms as well. Some interesting guns to choose from, not just your run of the mill Remingtons and Glocks.</Review>< GmapID>

Got my car back, lifted up the rug and boom....floor full of dirt/debris that I made sure to point out at start of visit. Got argued down that it wasn't there before and got a fake/insincere apology. I paid for services so I expected them to be performed thoroughly and they weren't . last time coming here.< /review>

I’ve been coming to this car wash FOR YEARS. Everything had been fine until this year. I’ve been here twice and I will never return. The first time they stole my sticker for my license plate from my glove compartment. I had just gotten them and should of placed them but come on now! No ethics. And then today I go in and pay for a Presidential Wash and why is my dash board and everything still covered in dust. I PAID for that service so I expect to receive that service. It’s not rocket science here. I am beyond disappointed in their service! Do NOT recommend this place to ANYONE!</Text></record></dataset><record>

They could have done a better job on ther inside but I'm also picky lol. Fair price and completed the job in a reasonable amount of time. For a small store, there is an extensive choice of products</text>

<Text>Bad experience, they don't know what are they doing and you can noticed right away.
I paid the platinum and It doesn't worth it I had to spend 30 minutes at home to detail.
Never come back and recommended.
They don't care about customer care and satisfaction.< /Text>< pictures>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>2/14/20 **STOLEN COLOGNE **
I’ve been to this car wash about 6 times since I’ve moved to Rancho 6 months ago. It was already under “NEW MANAGEMENT”  I have always been satisfied with the customer service and with the way they took care of my vehicle. My last visit with them 2/13/20 was no different from my previous experiences. Friendly, fast & did a good job. The only difference was on my way to work this morning, I realized my bottle of cologne was “MISSING” I’m not one to misplace things so I am 100% sure it was stolen out of my vehicle while they were washing/cleaning it. It’s sad and frustrating that someone would do this. I will be making a phone call over there when they open. It’s not about the value of the cologne more than it is about someone stealing from a customer and getting away with it. I really liked this place, looks like I may have to look for a new car wash. If anyone has any suggestions in the Rancho Cucamonga area feel free to share. If the manager wants to narrow down who was working that day (2/13/20) I was there around 3:00pm. I hate to leave a bad review due to the hospitality I always receive, but this just goes and shows you how ONE single person can ruin things for you/company.

Thanks, Fred.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<text>Pulled in at 2:30 afternoon on a Saturday. Two people were vacuuming a car next to me and two other men were sitting at the table (one with a car wash shirt) and just looked at me. I thought they may approach me and ask what type of wash I wanted. They just sat there looking at me so I got out and walked past them to the booth. Nobody was there and the two never said a word either time I walked by them. After I got back in my car, the one with the shirt got up and walked away. I started my truck and drove away as they just looked at me. I guess they didn’t want any business and I don’t think I’ll bother driving back again. Funny, the sign says under new management. Looks like it wasn’t a change for the better.< /text><rate>1</rate>< Pictures>

<text>Came to wash my work vehicle here, because of the height I needed a place that can do hand washes, the guy came over and said he needed to ask how much the hand wash would be and when he came back he quoted 65 dollars. I've taken my vehicles to places that have charged 40 dollars to do a hand wash for a large box truck, but never this much. With how busy the place looked, it seems they quoted me sky high so that they wouldn't have to wash my van.<//text>< Name>

This place is horrible! They lost my keys and blamed it on me!! I told the "Manager" and he told me that I had the keys. I told him: "clearly I don't have the keys since you drove my truck around the facility in order to wash and then dry it." After expressing this to him, he walked off. I told 2 more employees and one yelled at me and the other told me to talk to the Manager. After saying a few choice words, they finally found my keys. One of the workers put my keys on a tire when she was drying it and forgot it there. This was the same employee who yelled at me and told me "I haven't seen your keys!!" Run! Run! Run!!!! They're irresponsible, rude, unprofessional and didn't wash my car good. Go somewhere else!!< /Text>

I do not usually write reviews good or bad, but the service and quality of work here were excellent. I came in for an interior detail and they delivered as promised and the price was reasonable for the quality. Many thanks for a great job by Oscar and his team!</text>

<review>The gentleman whom attends you at the carwash  always tries to up sell you on a service you don't need. And when you don't buy it he threatens that ,he is not responsible if the vehicle does not come out clean. Truth is I've bought the basic car wash in the past and they do a better job than when you pay for all the extra services . So I am not quite sure if this extra service is a scam or what? But they left all the bird poo still on my car. So not only did I pay for the lousy car wash but I also ended up washing it again myself. Safe to say I won't be coming here again.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80c335d0860b3cab:0xb8f2e0b2ddb74f4< /GmapID></record>

<Time>1509028761516</Time><Rating>1</Rating><text>Had asked for the presidential car wash on my newer car which is roughly about $24. When the car came out they let it sit out in the sun so long with water on it l that It got water spots all over it. When they called me over to say the car was done not only did it have water spots but now it also still had some bird poop on it. I ask for a refund or to rewash the car they refused. I said I was going to have to give them a bad review manager said "it won't be the first and it won't be the last"  but here's the kicker, I had my mom with me who is disabled, and she has a handicap pass which they stole. Do yourself a favor there are plenty of car washes in this town, skip this one for sure.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Come here for the Awesome Service! I drive all the way from Fontana, to Rancho to get My Impala washed. They work with you on the price with details ask for Oscar most Down to Earth guy Ever! Not some janky car wash that you doubt sending your car through. The guys here are all helpful, and treat my car like it was their car. They take a little longer on my car, because they hit every inch of it. And I trust them so much, I don't even have to walk around it to check it! I refer all my friends and family here! All are satisfied!< /review>

I will never go back to this place. I paid 22.00 dollars and that was the worse car was I have never had. When I drive through a car wash and pay 5.99 dollars I get better service. There was trash still in the inside of my door and dirty under the bumper close to my trunk. I was very upset but I had been there over a half hour and I had company coming in at the airport and didn't  want to be late.< /Review>

<Time>1419224930131< /Time><Rate>2</Rate><Review>Rancho friends.....I do not want anyone to experience what we did today at the 76 Rancho Carwash off Arrow and Hermosa. If you get a normal $10 car wash, you will be fine here. I have done that many times- no problems.
However, if you get a detail, like we did for my two cars this week, you will have trouble. Sadly, we had to "converse" with the very rude manager after both cars...mine was about a "drippy" look on my clear coat. Basically what it came down to is him giving horrible customer service, telling  us that our car was like that before and that I was just trying to get free service. I was not asking for a refund, just trying to get the cars done right. My car looked horrible. I decided to pay an extra $50 because the guy said we needed a full buff to fix the issue. When we picked up the car, the drips were sorta gone but the buff was super spotty---like over 20 spots of wax.
He ended up saying that we shouldn't expect a 100% job but should be happy with  a 90% job! We didn't expect perfection but wanted to get what we paid for- a detailed car. It ended up that they refused to fix it the way it should be and we were out a good amount of money (we paid $350 for both cars)---with a weird looking buffed look on my paint that I will have to fix.
Even the guy who did my car said it was because of the poor lighting (they were working on my car at 4pm) and due to the fact they have hard water.
Anyway, we won't be going there again, if you are going to get a detail there--don't.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

They stole my brother and niece's scratchers that I forgot on the counter and immediately went back not two minutes later. Bata kept saying, "You saw me hand them to you" when I implied nothing of the sort, that's one reason why I know they stole them. The other reason is because they said they couldn't pull up their surveillance cameras (so if I were a robber, I could have robbed them and got away with it?). After 20 years of going there, they are shady and betrayed my trust. They will no longer receive my business and I will tell everyone of my unfortunate and terrible customer service and experience and recommend they stay away from these conniving thieves. They also had nats on their condiments in their food court; that's a violation of heath code.<//text>

Went to the car wash for a oil change and wash and was very disappointed. The guy who performed the oil change Rudy was very rude and did not even ask what kind of oil I wanted. I guess that's why he just does oil changes and is not a real Mechanic!
I wanted synthetic oil and he just used regular standard oil without even offering my options. When I asked Rudy why he did not offer me my options he told me that he was too busy and that I wanted a oil change and got a oil change.
After taking my complaint to someone who appeared to be the owner he told me that Rudy does that sometimes and not to let it get to me. He offered me a free car wash but the oil change already comes with a car wash.
I will never go back to this car wash and will tell everyone I know about my experience!<//text>

I've been taking my cars to Rancho Car Wash for over 13 years. The service has never been stellar, but it was always adequate and they had the advantage of being one of the cheapest places in town to get your car washed. Not any more! Under new management they are now the most expensive place in town. They charged me $21.95 today for the same mediocre job they've always done. That's right folks $21.95 for a wash and vacuum. No wax, no air freshener, no armor-all, no nuthin...just a wash. There s nothing special about my car either; it's just a 12 year old plain jane Mitsubishi. Any other car wash in town will do a better job at a much lower price and I highly recommend you choose one of them. I know I'll never go back there.<//text>

Absolutely the worst car wash I have ever had the displeasure of using in my entire life! Terrible customer service, extremely rude and condensing attitudes! My vehicle air dried by the time an attendant was able to get to it. Water spots everywhere, barely touched the Inside, and hallf-assed vacuumed my car. I will never come here again!!!< /review>

Work is always good, Mario, Paulina, carlos, Raul, Boti and the rest are just awesome people.. owner however.. doesnt know how to respect his employees nor does he know how to keep their moral up. Used to be one amazing place to visit, now its desolate .. if u have a complian, he throws it upon his workers to demean them when he shpuld adress it properly. No wonder both customers and employees dont respect him and leave him.< /review>< pics>

I was riding my road bike for hours and finally got chance to stop at this gas station.
So i went inside with my bike and the manager told me to bring my bike outside and leave it there..it took me months to save money and buy this road bike(it aint cheap).. it's like leaving your car when your ignition is on.<//text>

<review>My tax preparer Kenneth Feldman handled my taxes with 100 % complete professionalism.🧑🏽‍💻
He was not only very knowledgeable 🤓🧑‍🏫about the entire process  but he was super friendly & easy to talk to, he also got me the maximum 💰 amount on my refund(:
I ended up not having to pay anything except the initial cost of the visit which was very reasonably priced ( especially considering the large amount of my refund) 😁😸✅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸.
God Bless America 🇺🇸 & God bless Jackson Hewitt and the fine, awesome individuals who assist there.
I will certainly always use Jackson Hewitt for all of my future tax preparations.
Ps. I also got a Jackson Hewitt ‘Serve’ card ( through American 🇺🇸 Express), which I was thrilled about.
Now I will have my refund electronically wired to my new card. 💳
I’m stoked 😸😁🤲🏽🙌.
100 % satisfied.
Thank you 🙏 🙂</review>< pictures>

<Text>I set out to honestly just eat something amazing , I didnt care about the price . I googled around while in the hotel . nothing really stood out . kind of wanted a nice steak but saw mixed reviews of even the best places and somehow the thought of a shake as I drove by this place made me stop . I decided to go with the tahoe burger because I assumed its what the special would be . asked to throw in a large strawberry shake . after biting into the burger that basically melted in my mouth with perfection . I immediately tasted the shake . I sat there for a minute .... Never have I felt sooo disrespected by McDon-tknowifimallowedtosayit . this place is way more bang for your buck I'm just sad theres nothing like this in quality or taste near me . I'll never drive by tahoe and not stop here . I regret not buying a burger to go. Leaving this review makes me hungry all over again</Text>< gmapID>

Just showed up at 1:15 to be told they are only doing ice cream orders and that they are prepping food...? I could understand if it was busy but there are only two tables eating who just got their food.<//review>

Takes forever to get food even tho it's for one person! 3 items!!! And some time you come to get fries and a shake but they are only doing ice cream even tho the ppl  In front of you got food. I use to like this place but they are way to slow. 45mins waiting for food no thank you.</Text>
<resp>{'time': 1618245181597, 'text': 'Tony, we apologize for the length of time. We are not a fast food restaurant. Items are made to order. And sometimes those orders are larger and more detailed so that can slow the process. We are working on a few new methods to speed the process while keeping our quality the same if not better.\nPlease give us another try.\nThanks for the feedback. It helps us improve for you.'}</resp></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This place is kinda hit-and-miss for me. I think it depends who happens to be working at the time. Customer service is usually pretty lousy, but food's pretty awesome. Shakes are great. Hamburgers and buns taste fresh. Fries portion size is pretty weak.... The kids corn dog meal strangely seems to come with more fries than just ordering a large fries.  Good, though.  We've been there 3 times and will likely be back.<//Text>< pictures>

Waited 45 minutes (with two guests in front of us) for burgers and fries. Shakes were good. Burger was honestly gross. They were out of all condiments except barbecue sauce. Do not stop here.<//Review>

Our experience here was a joke. They were out of vanilla ice cream. I asked for a regular size coffee shake with heath bar in it, I got a regular size coffee shake with no heath bar in it and was charged for a large. Come to find out, one of our other shakes had the candy in it. Two others in our party asked for large and got regular. Will not be coming back.</Review>

<review>Burgers and fires were ok. But over $40 for just 3 combos was ridiculous.  The staff that took our order was not very friendly. When ordering they seemed annoyed. We kept having to yell out order and ask what they were saying because of the traffic from the street.</review>< Pics>

Good service, great burgers and milkshakes. The kids burgers are the same size as the adult ones so if you have a few young kids you could probably split it.</review>

I used to love all of this place but now the chili cheese fries are barely anything and don’t tase right, extremely disappointing for the price. The ice cream used to be worth the price and now it’s too much. Sorry I am a local and used to love this place.< /text>

Used to be a great place. Seems like new owners have hamstringed the place. Multiple wrong orders and questionable quality. Only three stars for price</Review>

But eith that being said, I didn't mind paying it in the end because everything we ordered was SO DELICIOUS. I got a cheeseburger and my husband got the Tahoe Burger. They were perfection. Seasoned perfectly, cooked perfectly, and fresh toppings. The fries were amazing as well. Crisp and fluffy. And we got a strawberry milkshake as well and it was so thick, creamy, and full of real strawberries. These were perfect burgers and we were really impressed by their food. Service and price we weren't crazy about though.</text>< pics>

<Text>Maybe we went on a bad day but the meal did not match the price. My BBQ chicken sandwich was lacking flavor, seemed undercooked (chewy, hard to bite) and just wasn't enjoyable. My wife's burger was better but still seemed to be lacking for the 21 dollars we had to pay for two sandwiches and a single order of fries. The ice cream cone ordered after was actually the bright spot of the whole experience, though 4 dollars for a small swirl cone of soft serve is pretty steep.<//Text>< resp>

<Text>New owners since winter of 16/17, awesome service and great all around menu.  I highly recommend the Western Burger! They toast their buns perfectly on the griddle with butter! Consistently good food and service is quick or appropriate to how busy they are.

Best Burger in Tahoe for the price.  hands down.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
The food is basic and overpriced. The ice cream is average as well. If you order a burger expect to wait 30-45 minutes. The girls up front will be playing on their phones, not taking your order. The cook actually had to go find one out back on her phone and bring her up front to take my order. Then after waiting 40 plus minutes for my order, I discovered it had been sitting on the counter for 20 minutes or so as the little orange shirt girls weren't doing their job and calling out done orders.  One orange shirt girl was on a bench eating on her phone, the other disappeared to the back, probably on her phone again. The cook had to.come up and ask me if I was the order that had been sitting there for 20 minutes while I stood waiting for my food. Laughable service and below average, greasy, unseasoned burgers and fries. I will never eat here again, this exact kind of service has happened the last three times I went to Snowflake. My mistake for giving them money for their overpriced tourist trap. Please go somewhere else instead. TOURISTS BEWARE ITS A TRAP< /Review>

Most people were getting ice cream in cones and that might be the way to go. The milkshake tasted like a liquid dairy product blended with ice. I was expecting a much thicker milkshake considering that they have soft serve.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

The food was good. I ordered a vegan burger and it was delicious. We also ordered zucchini fries. I felt they had too much batter and they gave you a lot! My husband and I shared them and wound up throwing half of them away. We just had water but I liked that they had a cooler inside and outside for you to refill your cup.
There were outdoor tables with umbrellas for shade. That was nice. They had indoor seating too. We had no trouble finding a place to sit.
I needed to use the bathroom since this was our first stop after arriving in Tahoe after a 2 hour drive and the gal said their bathroom was out of order and when I asked her for the nearest facility, she said it was at the beach. A little far to go before my order would be ready. I decided to go to a toy shop next door. The gal there said she was surprised they had not fixed the bathroom yet since it had been out of commission for awhile. She then walked me over to a pizza place next door. Honestly, more help from her than the Sno Flake In where I bought my food. That part was disappointing.
I also asked for the sauce for my burger to be put on the side but it was not. :(
The food was was 4 stars. The help from staff..2</Review>

<Review>Worst service ever....worst food ever and worst value for your money. The cashier was the rudest we have ever seen at any restaurant. Had to wait long after our burgers were ready to get our drinks and then we had to ask twice. The restaurant was not clean and smelled horrible. Probably the worst experiences we have ever had at any restaurant. Not a good place to eat at all.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Boring. Skip this place. Burgers are premade circles and are overwhelmed by the fluffy buns and half a head of lettuce.
I will say the chicken tenders were good. But the advertise their burgers are something special,nope.< /Review>

Drove up to Tahoe for the day for our son's Bday getaway. We decided to eat some good food up in Tahoe. We googled and this place came up...had to read the reviews. what sold me were there garlic fries so it seemed. We got there ordered our food and they don't even have ga4lic fries as advertised 🤦🏻‍♀️... I gave it 4 stars coz even tho the food Was amazing and service was really good... their soda machine was broken and so we had to have lemonade. but it was still good. (hope they fixed the soda machine). Overall FOOD WAS AMAZING.</Review>

<Review>Food was good, but not great. Took way too long to get our food and we had little kids that were hungry! Over 35 mins to get 3 hot dogs plain and a burger, plain! Ordered an order of zucchini and sweet potatoes fries... they were only like warm at best, the burger had to be sent back twice! Told them burger and bun only, nothing else on it, how hard is that? They also had no ice! The employees were busy on their phones and chatting...it was not very busy when we ordered!!!??? Overall, a 3 star rating is for the food being okay.< /Review><rating>3<//rating>< Name>

I've been there 4 times and have always had the same experience - a 25-35 minute wait for just a soft-serve ice cream cone, even when there is a short or no line.  The milkshakes are very liquidy and in no way the best in town as they say.  The cones are good once you get it.  Pass on the burgers - much better burger places all over town.< /Text>

This place was recommended by a local. The hamburgers and fries are so good! The burgers are big, but I devoured mine after a few hours of snowshoe hiking. Friendly staff. Food came out in a timely fashion. Came back a second time before leaving Lake Tahoe.< /review>

This place wasn't busy when we arrived and our food was ready with in 5 min. The food was really good. The whole family loved what they got. The grilled chicken sandwich needed a little seasoning on the chicken, but still good with the potato bun. The chilli cheese fries were a hit, but the shakes...oh so good!!</text>

Disappointed! Haven't eaten here in awhile. They used to be great. Ate here today. Burger was ok. Bacon was terrible! Only one piece and it was all fat no bacon. I can't believe they'd put that on a burger.< /Text>

I recommend the salmon burger or the mushroom burger; those are just my choices. I'm from the east coast (NYC) and so this place made me feel right at home. The food was amazing, period! I loved the milk shakes, too<//review>

Used to be better. Service wasn't that great, sort of rude. Didn't get the order right and had come before some months ago where order was wrong again. Ice cream and shakes are way over priced. $15 for chili cheese fries and a shake....not pleased at all. Also the regular toppings that used to come with the chili cheese fries are now a dollar. Not a local spot anymore. Bummed. I won't be back.</Text>

Recently changed owners. Have not had the burgers since then however the price for a soft serve cone is a joke. Over $4 for a cone. A bit high when you can get 4 of them for that price at McDonalds.< /text>

<text>Long wait for a burger that was a bit bland. Ordered the Tahoe burger,  it came with just a little of the grilled mushrooms and onions--I expected more for the price.  Fries and onion rings were really tasty though.

And one last thing, ordered 2 kids meals with lettuce and tomatoes, and a coke no ice.  Got ice in my coke and no lettuce and tomatoes in the burgers--I paid extra for that!  Boarder dude in the kitchen needs to focus and get the orders right! And stop yapping and get the orders out!

Second and probably last time coming here.< /text>< userid>

#greatshakes #amazingicecreamcones the food has been better in the past, when the new owners took over a few years ago they changed the product to a less expensive vendor and you can tell the quality of the food went down. Yet they are still amazing with fries, and ice cream dishes</review>

$27 and change for 2 meals, waited 25 minutes at 8:30pm. Food was cold when I finally went and asked where it was. When I asked for a refill of coke they tried to charge me. Way too expensive for what it is!!  I won’t be back.<//review>

<review>Love that this place has managed to survive the years!  An old time ice cream stand, like I remember going to as a kid.  They don't do dip cones here anymore :( but their shakes are pretty good!  I had a teriyaki burger.  It was juicy but the teriyaki sauce needs just a little more umami if you ask me.  I will definitely be back.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Their ice cream is good but they stopped dipping the cones. Also, they are either running out of items or taking them off the menu.< /Review>

I have fond memories of this place since I was a little kid and I'm glad to say it's just as good 20 years later. Sno-flake is a real American tradition.<//text>

Dont eat here if you need a handicap parking spot. They have one, but good luck getting from your vehicle to the restaurant.You have to walk over a high curb, then down a dirt covered hill.</Review>

Exceptional sandwich spot with great meats, fresh veggies, and incredible bread. Prices are low ($9 for full sandwich and chips), and the staff are cool. Makes me wish I had some events to get catered. Only knock is for their vegetarian sandwich; artichoke hearts, bell peppers, pickles, or jalapenos would be a nice add.< /Review>

Due to COVID they weren't open on the weekends, but was able to have an employee come in on Saturday to take care of my order. Everyone raved about how good everything tasted.

I have been listening to my boyfriend rave about Max's Deli for MONTHS and was wondering what could possibly so amazing that would cause him to eat there almost every day for lunch. Well let me tell you, I finally had the opportunity to eat at Max's Deli during my most recent trip to California and believe it or not I think he undersold it. The food IS THAT GOOD. The chili is absolutely to die for and the housemade mustard on the sandwiches is positively drool worthy. Not to mention Max himself and all of the staff were so incredibly kind and friendly. I will absolutely be back every chance I get and am completely devastated I live so far away, because I too would eat lunch here every day.</text>

Max's Deli is AWESOME!

When I worked in Auburn, I pretty much ate here everyday!  That's the only thing I miss about working in Auburn is getting to eat here all the time.

I try to stop by any chance I get.  Their food is the best and the people are great!< /review>

According to Google, I've eaten at Max's Deli 66 times. That's 66 times I've made the best decision possible for lunch that day. Eat at Max's, your stomach will thank you, and you'll be supporting a local, family owned business as well!< /Text>

Absolutely Phenomenal Experience! Everybody is so nice....Definitely keeps me coming back! Max is wonderful and truly cares about service and a good customer experience. They are the only one in town with the "order" app (from Square) which makes it very easy to order your food on the go. I recommend this place to anyone that has time to come by. Great experience and great food!</text>

<Review>We've heard nothing but good comments from everyone, so my wife and I decided to try out Max's today. I don't know why we didn't try it sooner, it was AWESOME !! The service was great and the food was fabulous.  I would recommend this fine deli to everyone.

Exceptional sandwiches and soups at reasonable cost. Owner is working nearly every hour it’s open and the quality and attention to detail reflects this. This should be a regular stop for your lunch!</review>

Best sandwhich in Auburn hands down. The price is very fair for the quality and you get a free bag of chips. I was impressed with this place. The only thing is, its hard to find in a weird location, but its very worth finding.< /Review>

<date>1493137822531< /date><rating>2< /rating><text>Hugely disappointed with the reopening of Max's Deli.  Waited for months,  as we all did,  and it's not the same .  My favorite sandwich is not up to par, my favorite drink, hibiscus tea, was not available nor was the black tea, that I did get, freshly brewed.  The price for it all has gone up and the seating in Max's is awful.  The benches are uncomfortable and now you either face the wall when you eat or the room. The seating before was much more comfortable and gave one a feeling of openness. Having worked with architects and designers my entire professional career I know that you can get terrible advise about many things.  This is what appears to have happened here. I will give Max's one more try.<//text>< pics>

<resp>{'time': 1493160550026, 'text': "Andrew, we're saddened to hear that your latest visit was not what you'd expected.\n\nIn response to the iced tea, yes, we did change brands which was necessitated by the flood we experienced and unfortunately we can't comment further but agree, it's not the same.\n\nSecondly, the seating is meant to accommodate more folks in the same amount of space with more options for single diners or larger groups, it may not be perfect and we look to improve upon it in the near future. Regarding prices, a nickel increase.\n\nFinally, as to your sandwich, not knowing what your favorite is I can't speak to it directly however, it sounds as if we've fallen short of your expectations and that's never a good thing. We invite you to visit us again and we'd be happy for the chance to impress you upon your next visit, seating notwithstanding.\n\nThank you again, your honest opinion & feedback is always welcomed.\n\nSincerely,\nMax Berkowitz\nMAX'S DELI"}</resp><gmapID>0x809b101241689cff:0x5ee606983e247bbb</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

We stumbled apoun this wonderful resturant one day when we were craving a good sandwhich. Looking up their menu we thought everything sounded good, may as well give it a shot! When you walk in, Max's has a nice down to earth home feel, and a very personal interaction makes you feel welcomed. But the food? The Sandwhiches are beyond amazing, fresh avocado and greens on Cibatta or whatever you please. But let's take a moment of silence for my sweet tooth because their dessert bars are undeniably sinful. But you know what's the best out of all of it? Everything is a beyond reasonable price and you get to say "Hi" to Max yourself. If you are in Auburn passing through or whatever it may be, stop in to Max's trust me it's worth it!< /text>

Our pastrami typically has a little fat on it however, no gristle but perhaps a bit too much of the spice rub. If that’s what you received we weren’t doing our job. If you’ll shoot us your email address to:\n\ninfo@eatatmaxs.com\n\nWe’ll get you taken care of and perhaps earn back a few of those stars.\n\nSincerely,\nMax Berkowitz\nMAX’S DELI'}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Im disappointed in our shopping experience. I had a coupon for you know the $10 off that they do and I had a few that came into my email so after spending an hour shopping for my son, get to the register.. time to pay I bring out my paper coupon and I put my phone with the other coupon thats been emailed too me...the cashier tells me they same coupons so I don't know why Children's Place would do that first off! that's like really ignorant then we have to go back through the clothes to take off everything that I couldnt use the coupon for. but then my husband notices another cashier giving a coupon to another lady which allowed her to go get more clothes I just want people to be fair. I didnt knw they where the same coupons. But its cool ill call corporate tomorrow</review>

This store is horrible the manager over the phone stated that she would help me out if I would come to the store 10mins after closing I get there and ask them I'm here to pick up my order this was 6:08 pm so I knock and knock the other employees were just talking and smiling until I yelled and said to speak to there manager mind you there was other customers trying to get out of the store.we waited 10mins so she can open the door there was still 5 customers waiting to get ranged up , I told the store manager hey that was really rude of your employees why didn't they just tell me I couldn't be helped she smiled and laughed so I told her your just as rude well I'm here for my stuff she said no I cant help you sorry were closed and wouldn't let me in. All I have to say is this girl is not a manager what so ever she needs to be replaced and so do the employees. I'll make sure to call her district manager and her corporate.</text>

Terrible customer service! Not sure if she was the manager, but she had some funky painted eyebrows. She had such a bad attitude with everyone. She responded to everyone in a rude way. If she doesn't like her job, she should look for a different job. Not retail!!!!</Text>

Everything is a complete mess! It was very hard to walk, the clothes on the floor gets stepped on and it’s sold that way, dirty. The employees are NOT helpful at all. Manager is a joke, they spend more time standing around chatting than being helpful with customers and/or cleaning up a bit. This store is disgusting, outdoors and indoors.</review>

<Rate>2</Rate><text>Great prices and a great selection, only problem is they have HORRIBLE customer service here! All their associates need better training with customer service. I went in last week and the associate Jocellyn who was assisting me, did not know how to input my gift card as part of my purchase. She was having trouble scanning it thru so she went to ask the so called "manager" and even she couldn't figure it out. Instead she instructed her to tell me, "if it doesn't go thru then she's just going to have to use another form of payment". And to top if off, Jocellyn comes back and stated "sorry about that its cus it's the managers last day and she doesn't want to do anything today, she's ready to leave ". LOL . WOW. That's BAD customer service, as an associate you would never tell a customer this, specially coming from a manager. I couldn't believe she had just told me this. After waiting 20minutes , she finally got a way to use my gift card after asking a third associate, which then they just start having a personal conversation while ringing me up. Horrible place. Their associates are very rude and need more training.< /text>< Pics>

I love Sobre Mesa….. the staff are awesome, the eats are small but great tasting. The only thing keeping me from rating a 5 is one of the items I ordered I. The past seemed to shrink in size. It was the Braised Oxtail Hash. Still pretty amazing tho.<//text>

< Review>
The most dreamy dinner @sobremesaoak last night. I blindly made reservations for an indoor table in this beautiful space a couple of weeks back and it was pretty easy to find friends who were down to ball out at this chic Afro-Latino spot. We ordered a lot but I only have 10 spaces for photos, so bear with me... Firstly the Bone Marrow was probs my fave dish with pickled cassava and jerk chimichurri. The Stuffed Ripe Plantain with @impossible_foods meat and soy chorizo 😗🤌🏽 These amazing duck fat chicken wings 🍗 drenched in a Nigerian 🇳🇬 Red Sauce (obe ata dindin, made from tomatoes and peppers) were also a huge hit. Lobster Thermidor with squid ink, the Gulf Shrimp with garlic confit. The Pernil Pork Tenderloin was so delicious and had a wonderful BBQ-like flavor to it. We ordered several of the Steak Empanadas, the meat inside was so flavorful and satisfying. Tostones with nduja and anchovy. Oysters on a half shell with pineapple sofrito and smoked trout roe as well as these juicy marinated olives. And we had to ask for the dessert specials as they weren’t on the menu but I’m sure glad we did because these little confectionaries were heaven: Passionfruit Mousse and Carrot Cake with Pineapple mint relish. WHEW 🥵 Not pictured but also enjoyed are the padron peppers, several pitchers of cocktails and a seriously gorgeous ambiance. Reservations recommended, but they also had outdoor tables with heaters avail for walk-in diners. Every dish was spot on I highly recommend eating here!!!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️IG: @thetastetess</Review>

Such a throwback to old Hollywood 50's diners. Loved the menu.  It catered to our particular diet and yet still had so much to offer (love a coffee shop that has almond milk). The decor was so darling. Fireplaces at either side of the restaurant with a long breakfast bar in the middle.  Very classy, yet so cozy.</Text>

Amazing food and amazing staff! Cocktail menu was on point. The tapas were great. I highly recommend the empanads - they were super flakey and delicious. A very unique tasting empanada you might not be used to but nonetheless so flavorful! The owner is also on Season 8 of Top Chef. Go Nelson!!!< /Text>

<review>I have my tanks refilled here because Walmart is more expensive. Here, you will have your tank filled up to five gallons. Walmart only fills it up to four gallons and is more expensive. Good customer service.< /review>< Rating>

We went to go sell a peacock and these two workers helped us get it off the neighbors property once it flew away which was pretty cool of them. Idk like they probably got paid to help us but if not then I really appreciate it plus the one lady who works at the register on weekends it's pretty cool too, she laughs at my lame jokes lmao☠</text>

It was like going back in time very old building,  Pretty cool  Environment, I grew up in Whittier at a young age we had these types of feed stores with animals chickens goats we had some farms there too so it just took me back were i lived  Back then, here in the high desert now it  just was pretty cool to me.👍 good prices on there propane I noticed goats chickens different types of birds I believe they sell the goats the large animals you could buy here pretty cool give it a five star.👍😉</review>

<Text>I was the first one in line for propane and had to walk inside to get service. As I was walking inside another vehicle had pulled up for propane. Employee and myself walked out together to the propane tank and he started taking the other guy stuff first I had told the employee I was first. He said ok and had a conversation in Spanish with the other customer and as I was getting another tank out of my vehicle he started feeling the other guy's first. Again I had told him I was first he told me the other guy was in a hurry I told him  so was I he still continued to fill the other guys think first.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

All of the employees are very welcoming and sweet! It was really cool that they allowed us to sit in the music rooms and play around a bit with the pianos! For sure going to return🙂</Text>

Awesome store! They had the keyboard case, the Gator GK76, in stock when no other local Guitar Center did. Justin in Pro Audio is a friendly, knowledgeable and  professional sales associate! Give this man a raise!!<//review>

<text>Extremely friendly staff, quality service, and great prices. Went in looking for a specific piece of equipment, and there was no attempt to upsell me another product.

Workers knew what I needed and wasted no time guiding me to my requested product while answering every question I had. Love this store!<//text>< user_id>

Nick G is the best customer service guy ever. He has been a huge help to me on many occasions and has always gone above and beyond to make sure I leave happy. I'll always go to Guitar Center for my musical needs because I've had such great experiences with him! This guy deserves a raise. Thanks Nick you rock!</Text>

< review>
Guitar Center in Murrieta, and Matthew J Norris the Repair Tech. are wonderful. Matt is an artiste and a genius.  He repaired my 71 year old Ukelele, Which I'd been told could not be fixed.  My friend Ralph, who has been a loyal Guitar Center Customer told me about Matt.  Ralph is an extraordinary guitar player and he took my Ukelele to Matt.  Matt is a miracle worker and my Ukelele is even better than new.  He is truly Amazing.  I am so pleased with the end result.  The Staff was very Welcoming; It was a really great experience.  Matt deserves at the very least Ten Stars.  Sincerely, INA WATSON, Sun City, California.<//review>

The employees were very helpful and kind for the most part. I had waited in line for about an hour and when I finally got inside the lady that helped us was very nice and knowledgeable. It wasn’t until about 15 minutes later I finally made a decision on a guitar I was going to buy. A wooden finish Jackson for about $300. I asked the lady if she would be able to find out the out-the-door price for me. She left us for a moment to go find that out for me, and while we were waiting a man, who I assumed to be the manager, came up to us and very rudely reminded us that we need to buy something (or not) and get out because there were other people waiting in line. He said if we’re just looking, to look another day. He then dismissed himself and walked away. Moments after, an employee walked by and briefly apologized for that fiasco and informed us there is a strict policy right now. We left moments after that and did not purchase anything. I’m giving 3 stars because the store itself and most of the employees are worth 5 stars hands down. However this experience was a 3-star experience and that is only because the lady who helped us was very nice. I understand times are tough right now and everyone is under stress, but there are more polite ways and respectful ways to talk to people.</review>

< Review>
Well started out like this I came from Idyllwild to guitar center it takes me two hours cuz there isn't a guitar center within the distance that has the  the drums I was looking for so so one of the staffs almost sent me to Rialto which is another 26 minutes to find the drums but the Rialto store is not a storage distributing center guitar center they didn't have those drums in stock so the guy sent me to one one place and it was the home the distributing center so we stopped from going there and we went to another one that said the drums were in stock and they weren't there so I had to buy another one don't like them missing pieces and I want to return it other than that I love your stores< /Review>

He was able to take care of our order with a great attitude. I had talked to someone over the phone at the corporate office and they gave me bad vibes and terrible attitude. I’m glad We ran into John, he made the curbside experience great and easy. Appreciated his help in times like this I know it’s hard but he kept a great attitude towards the experience!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

I went in to get a guitar as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine. It was a real quick trip. Just in and out. But the options they have here are great. A whole floor to ceiling wall. And there were lots of employees around if I had any questions. When I finally did go to buy one, the guy at the counter was real nice and any questions I had were answered. I'll definitely be coming back here in the future for gifts or anything else music related I need.< /review>

The best psrt is that they cater to musicians in general, not just guitarists. I do know that some people don't exactly like the customer service, but I have not found it to be too bad. I suggest that if you want a more personalized service then you should go to a local shop. However, doing so will not give you as wide of an option for instruments and gear like Guitar Center. I do recommend this place, but I also will say that they kind of need to up their customer service compared to other music stores.< /Review>< rate>

I am out here by the door waiting...their website says it is open today from 12nn til 7PM. Been here 10mins past 12 and nobody is answering the door or their phone. It is annoying coz I drove 30mins to get here and now it feels like I just wasted my gas. I am returning a guitar that was inaccurately described. It was supposed to be in "excellent" condition but it turns out it is "very good" with all the dings on the body and scratch on neck pickup. Will not trust their online stuff again. I wanna return this regardless of their pitch coz this is about accuracy on the description..if it is not, then it's either they lied or tried to deceive me as a consumer. Regardless,  I don't want to be a part of that so I'm returning the guitar. If I pay for an excellent guitar then it better be excellent as per their description of "excellent" condition.<//Text>

Not only do I love the atmosphere (of course) I love the Manager. He honored a pretty significant sale for me: one weekend after the original sale had ended, due to a manufacturer mis-advertisement. He is extremely knowledgeable, and he understood my audio production questions. His staff was able to inform me and educated me promptly about my queries. He knew exactly why I wanted the sale price, and he was happy to honor it for me. Don't expect him to do this all the time, but let me say I truly enjoy coming back and spending my money at this store. Why? Because the quality control is impeccable. Its the real deal. THANK YOU..ps..I cant believe the dust showing up in this picture, you can thank Samsung Cameras for that one xD<//review>

< Review>
Found an excellent guitar for under 300 bucks. My debit card had expired so the sales clerk signed me up for a Guitar Center gear card. Painless! Now I'm glad my old guitar broke because the new one is so much better. Thanks to Steve. (Salesman)<//Review>

<Review>This is a good store to go and buy music instruments, but my warning to all of you, don't ever open a credit card they offer in the store, Synchrony bank is the one they used, the company is the worst predatory loan you will ever encounter.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I have gone to this store a few times with a guitar problem. Each time a young lady in the back of the store cheerfully solved my problem. She has a work bench near the wall. She took my guitar and fixed the problem. She is the best that I have seen in any music store. She also advised me on what items were best for me. Each time that items worked perfectly. I don't know who hired this young lady but they made an excellent choice. .She has saved me hundreds of dollars.< /Review>

<Review>Did you know you can recycle your old #guitar strings at Guitar Center? Help reduce pollution and waste by bringing your used strings to the store and feel good about putting one less piece of trash in the landfill. Workers are very motivated to sell to you, know what you want before you shop or you'll get schooled.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I had a great experience at this guitar center in Murrieta. I was helped by Steve and he was awesome! I informed him that I wanted a bundle I saw online and he was able to get me the price match. He took my concern of not being able to wait 3-5 days for the piano as I needed ASAP for my lessons. Thank you Steve for all your help and for letting the young lady assist me to complete the transaction. Also, thank you for your follow up call Steve, to assure everything went well! You have amazing customer service, may your customers continue to be as satisfy as I am! Great friendly staff! Thank you!< /review>

I bought a Crate head online from these guys and asked Hector if there were any issues with the head. He said he fully checked out the amp and found no issues. When I got the head, the Reverb tank was missing and was never mentioned in the description or by Hector. Beware.</Text>

<rating>1</rating><Text>I have been getting my gear at this location for 8 years now and never had any problems purchasing items... but this review is specifically for those looking to get their guitar set up. In short, look else where for service.

I took my guitar in this last weekend and was extremely unsatisfied wit the service I received. First it took 3 days before their tech looked at the guitar; however when I called on two separate days, I was assured it was almost ready.

They spent more time stringing me around than they spent fixing my guitar. I went in and asked for my guitar back because I would prefer not to pay $90 (overpriced) for this type of service. The tech had started work but  was nice enough to stop work, despite changing the strings, and gave the guitar back. An assistant manager then stepped in, without me asking, but only worked to escalate the situation and antagonized me when I said I explained the situation. His handling of the situation was poor and just put a downer on my day. I definitely will not return because of him.

At the end of it all, I would have been much better off if I did not even bother trying to get my guitar serviced.< /Text>< pics>

This happened at the Visalia California location. My husband plays the bass left handed. We asked if they had any in stock, to which we were told they did not keep such things in stock. We asked if they could order one and we were told yes but they would need half down. Then we were told the price was double of a regular bass, which was a little high to us. I went online found what he wanted on THEIR website and the price was NOT double but only $50 more. They would not honor the online price. That is the last time we've been in that store.< /text>

<text>For working musicians Guitar Center is a good place to get miscellaneous stuff you forgot or that broke while setting up at a gig (strings, cables, guitar stands, emergency amps LOL etc.) because they are sort of local, and the prices are ok.
It is also a great place to check out gear BEFORE making your no hassle, less cost purchase through an online vendor (Sweetwater, Zzsounds, Music123 etc.)
I really hate buying gear there (getting the friends and family discount), only to get a GC flyer showing the gear I just purchased for 10-20% or more discounted (actually $800 in one particular case) less than my "bro deal"! Then go back and have to haggle for the money back or exchange. This EXACT thing happened to me on a Les Paul purchase I made there. It's Guitar Center...< /text>< pics>

<Text>Great staff with great attitudes.  My 15 year old son and I hung out for over an hour (on multiple occasions), while he tried different instruments.  The staff came over and talked with us and gave my son pointers.  We felt very welcome.  Although I didn't make any major purchases (I did make several purchases) the staff treated us very well.  I will definitely make any major purchases there in the future.</Text>< Rating>

I would give zero stars if I could. Sat in drums over 30 minutes and not one employee ever said a word to me. Also, they only had one electronic drum set  up and working, the others had missing power cords and wouldn't turn on at all. It's good the only thing that got wasted was my time and not the money I was going to use to buy a new kit there. It's okay, Sam ash here I come woo hoo<//text>

I've always liked the store, used guitars and new, reasonable prices, I recomend if you want to sell some music gear, do it your self,on line
Good selection of all music gear, salesmen are knowledgeable.< /Review>

Wish we had a decent alternative. We have purchased 3 guitars, amps, record players, an effects pedal, cords, cases, etc. in less than 2 years. Almost every time we go in there is a wait and then a delay. The equipment isn't ready, available: the manager is available, the tech is gone for the day. Yesterday, we dropped our new guitar off for a string change and to tighten the whammy bar because it fell off and were told it would be ready after lunch. We went back at 6pm and were told 1. They didn't know what we were referring to and then 2. The guitar wasn't ready. Today, we received a call that the guitar was ready, my son paid for it and brought it out to the car when he realised the whammy bar wasn't fixed. He took it right back in and the technician said she didn't have the right size nut or tool to tighten or fix it, the tool was at home. She asked us to leave the guitar behind and she would get to it tomorrow. Seriously?!?!</Text>

<text>I havent had customer service this bad in a while. Not to mention the employees were very uninformed and you can just tell everything is based on comission. I ended up not spending any money there even though they had the product I wanted just because they were that bad. Will never give this store my money.< /text>< pics>

<text>Started my quest going to this location to buy a Marshall combo amp, Mike the guitar guru told me to check out the new Fender Mustang amp.  A bit hesitant but I did and bought the Mustang I, loved it and brought it back to upgrade to the Mustang III.  Three weeks late I brought it back and upgraded once again.  I now have the Mustang IV and love it.  The people working there were always helpful and never bothered about the returns.  I have to tip my hat to Guitar Gurus Mike and Derek for going above and beyond...by a lot to make sure I got what was going to work for me and make me a happy customer.  Thanks.<//text>< pics>

<review>Never have I been disrespected in my life Like I was by Shane. I purchased an item in San Marcos and was treated as if I was stealing the product right off their shelf in Murrieta.  Shane told me that ,"San Marcos needs to quit sending up their customers cause it literally doesn't work that way and it isn't as easy as it sounds." He also said he needed to clarify that my payment had been pulled before he can "just hand me product. "  It had already been 24 hours since I purchased my product and this  was all done within 3 minutes of meeting him. I asked for a manager because I knew this was going downhill quickly and he had the audacity to ask me if I still wanted my product and if there was a problem. The store was clean and everyone else was nice but this guy clearly needs some training.  Thank you to management to handling this issue.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>For what ever reason. This particular store has people who don't know anything. Which might explain why it's a ghost town. Only two or three other customers are in the store Everytime I go in. But just simply. The musical instrument IQ. People not knowing what I am asking for. People not wanting to help with questions I might have. Just acting like they don't want to help. Yet, when I go to the San Marcos store. It's full, the people are musician friendly and know what I'm saying. I can have an actual conversation with them on different experiences. That store is 50 miles away. I worked for guitar center in the 80's we Hussle to get the sale, we worked with the customer to get him satisfied. I noticed, Sam Ash is like that. They are 60 miles away. The merchandising is wrong in that store. All the guitars and amps are out a distance when, they should be one of the first things you see. Not an accessory counter with no one behind it. Maybe the location is wrong. Either way. People on the sells floor need to be more enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and inviting. I know having a actual store is tuff to compete with online but, people still want to see it first. If you can get them in the door. You can get them to buy. I know because I was a successful bicycle retail store. Anyway fix it or you'll probably be closings the doors.<//review><Date>1551558408947<//Date><Rating>1< /Rating>< Response>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>Way overpriced even at sale prices.  Need to drastically drop prices and move inventory and create a foot traffic flow that then spends their cash instead of looking at it, leaving, and buying online, or elsewhere.  Be a volume  leader in the field for once. Lower prices 30% across the board on EVERYTHING listed as full retail price. THEN create sale pricing from that point on slow moving items!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Text>I had been trying to get some parts for some pro audio gear and had problems with numerous distributors.  At first, I didn't think that this Guitar Center location could help either due to some misunderstandings.  When I visited the store recently regarding this issue, the manager Randy met me at the door.  He was humble, gracious, personable and accommodating.  He even took the time to get to know me, my business and my music background.  This store may have gotten off to a slow start from when they first opened but they have come a long way since.  Their entire staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  The entire Guitar Center corporation has treated me well for decades.  This store is another shining example of their uncompromising professionalism in a sometimes misunderstood and under-appreciated industry.

►►►UPDATE: I have been in the "industry" for many decades.  I never skimp on my own equipment but am hesitant to invest large sums that will be in the hands of customers and guests.  However, it came back to bite me in the a** today.  Then, I went in and spoke to Jessie and Travis in Pro Audio.  Yes, they are influenced to make sales but I asked them as friends and fellow musicians and businessmen for a sincere recommendation on wireless microphones and I received one.  As I see it, they see customers and equipment come and go and get returned.  They know what's hot for what you want to pay.  Today, they pointed me in a superb direction with an Audio Technica microphone and I couldn't be happier.  Trust these representatives, they do not hire people who do not know their industry!  Many, many thanks gentlemen!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Usually I have good experience here but there's a bunch of new people working here who don't know what they are doing. Caleb couldn't even turn on the bass amp and accused us that it didn't work we showed him how turn it on he was really rude about it as was Manny. Manny wasn't just rude and a smart aleck to us but a few others including a kid trying to find drumsticks. Terrible customer service!</Text>

I'm a drummer personally, and the drum department is very nice. Besides some of the employees there in the drum department like the long haired Chinese guy there. He is disrespectful and was talking bad to me about one of the other employees that wanted to give me drum lessons.<//review>

Kind of a small location compared to the Hollywood G.C. but they still have a great selection of gear. Customer service is hit or miss. Most of the time when im in there the employees are on their phones, texting or something. It takes awhile to get help. Get ready to wait in a line to checkout, you're going to be there for awhile.<//Review>

The staff are nice but I was given MIS-information on two items I recently purchased "in store". That information lead to me having to spend more money and time on additional "accessories" which I was told come with the gear I was buying, not one but two of the items? I was planning on using the gear a week ago and now I'm being told by their 'customer service' that one of the items is on backorder! Unbelievable that they wouldn't know this when placing the order for me?<//text>

This place is by far trash i paid almost 700 dollars for a komplete kontrol mk2 keyboard that i thought was brand new and was actually used not only that the guy ryan that sold it to me didnt give me a receipt he had gave me only a receipt for what i had put on layer way everything was missing out of the box accept the keyboard .they also tried to sale me an apogee duet that was used not bad for the price it was only 375 i asked if it was the duet 2 or the most recently duet that had came out he lied about that as well and told me it was just in a duet 2 box but was the most recent one... i wouldnt recommend this place at all.< /text>

<review>Great personalities in the talented people. They are not all that interested in arm twisting - just gentle pointing to answers for your needs. I find the bass department and the live sound people are top-notch; kind and considerate of even the dumbest questions.

I spent a lot of money here in the past few months and they all treat me with the utmost respect from the first time when they didn't know me up until now when I am on a first name business.

I've been to larger GC venues, and they are somewhat more removed from their customers. This Murrietta store is a little smaller and more friendly I feel.

No hustle, no hassle and no pressure makes it a pleasure to visit. I buy everything I need from these guys even though they are over 50 miles away. I'll drive for fair and considerate people like them any time!< /review>< Time>

Be ready to get surprised.
Today I called to see if they have clarinet cork grease, which they told me they have a bunch that come in packages. An hour later I got to the store, I tried to purchase it but SURPRISINGLY they told me they don't have any..
Driving 54 miles (back and forth) and wasting two hours of my time .

IF  , and IF you decide to shop there make them to swear they have what you looking for.</Review>
