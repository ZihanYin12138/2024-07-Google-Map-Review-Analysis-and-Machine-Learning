I’m very comfortable here. At my first appointment I actually saw the doctor!  Dr. Pena looked me in my eyes and was very sincere and showed empathy for my concerns. He didn’t rush me. I appreciate the fact I get to see a doctor every visit. The staff is efficient and kind. Thank you AVORS!<//text>

< Review>
I've had both hips replaced, left 20 + years ago. Been having pain. I have rarely had a doctor that actually listened. If was a pleasant change. Great news, hip implants are mechanically sound, hoping PT will help with the pain. Only one visit, but I know if/when my hips need to be replaced, this is where I'm going !</Review>

On the opening page you addressed me once as Louise and once as John.  On this page you address me as Ron.  What gives?

This posting is from Louise: Everyone was, as always, very polite and helpful.  I never have to wait long to see the doctor and I get all my questions answered in depth.  No one seems rushed yet I know how busy they are.</review>

<Review>Dr. Antebi has replaced both of my hips. His work is awesome. He is now going to do surgery on my broken right hip. I wouldn't trust any one else to do it. The office staff is very professional and friendly. I highly recommend him to anybody that needs an Orthopedic. So I will also recommend Avors Medical Group.< /Review>< Pictures>

I have been seeing Dr. Nasser for several years now and he always takes the time to listen to my concerns They always make me feel comfortable about anything that I have concerns about. The women are very warm and welcoming when you arrive. I’m always seen in a timely manner. Everyone associated with AVORS is very friendly and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for an excellent Orthopedic Dr.</Text>

I have been through so many so-called doctors out here trying to get some relief, and finally found this group of real doctors, and medical professionals that know this is a special calling, and treat their patients as such. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and efficient.  I see Karina and what a God send.  She actually listens and follows through, and I am finally hopeful and getting some relief, and actual answers.< /Text>

<Text>This is a wonderful facility except for on thing De Sherfey. This guy made me show up appointment after appointment telling me nothing wrong with my knee. Well apparently there is something wrong they are both ruined now and I am nearly crippled. He never has time for the patient. I do have one question, Dr Sherfey, if there was nothing wrong then why would you operate on me? Oh yeah to get paid. Terrible doctor with no morals or ethics< /Text>< gmapID>

I have been going to AVORS for a few years. Dr Nasser is awesome, no matter how busy he is always makes you feel like you are special,  Dr Pena is very friendly as is Dr Heller.  None of those 3 make u feel as though u are not worth their time. The staff at the office and surgery center are very friendly.  Great place to go.<//Review>

With in a month, I had my 1st appt. with Dr. Antebi.  I was told exactly what to expect regarding my total hip replacement.  I then went into surgery with no caution or worries. Came home that afternoon.  4 weeks post hip replacement, I am taking it slow without any mobility aids.  I deeply appreciate the direct and professionalism I received while under Dr. Alon Antebi's and his Medical Team's care.  Thank you!< /Review>

He was a fantastic dr with a very caring personality. He made me feel very comfortable about the surgery and explained everything to me about the surgery and the after care. When I went to the office for my follow up appointment the staff were all very caring and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this office to anyone who needs orthopedic care.< /Text>

Unfortunately I fell while out for a run and fractured my hip. Fortunately for me Dr Antebi was available to fix it. Three months later I am doing great, well on the way to full recovery and so thankful. He also fixed my husband’s clavicle 2 years ago. I cannot recommend anyone more than Dr Antebi for any orthopedic needs. Review would only allow me to give 5 stars he deserves many more!</review>

This has to be the most unprofessional medical group I have ever been involved with. I received a mail from my insurance company requesting a medical necessity letter from AVORS about a procedure i had done and I must had called and told AVORs about the need to have that medical leter sent to my insurance company at least 3 different times but they never did and right now am  stuck with a bill that I should not have ever had. Sadly,  this is not the only issue I have had with this place which seems always unprepared.< /review>

Dr. Justin Sherfey has been amazing from the day I met him before the surgery until now while I am going through my rehab. Before I went into the operating room he took a load of me by us praying together but the most important thing is that even a real honest with me. He told me what I was going to go through with the rehab. And he has been right on for the first month. I am walking around doing stairs running in place doing a ski machine at 3 and 1/2 Weeks. He was honest about the pain that I  was going to go through so that when I am feeling it I was warned ahead of time. Nothing was hidden from me. Surgery day it was all a positive experience made by the doctor and everyone they got involved with me every one of the nurses the anesthesiologist and everyone that participated with me that day. I would recommend this doctor and his staff did anyone that asks me.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>I have spent an hour trying to make an appointment to a scheduled a trigger point injection for my arm since i practically can't use my right arm currently.

Every 10 minutes i get to a message that says I've been on hold for too long and tells me to leave a message but the mailbox is full! When I finally get through to somone she says she can't schedule appointments at the front desk (which isn't true as I've done it) and transfers me to somone else that doesn't return my message.

Now I'm doing the 10 minute holds again except its after 5 so I've just ended up wasting 2 hours< /Review>< response>

I heard about AVORS Medical  from a great friend of mine, who kept raving about this Dr. Nasser. I saw the difference in her from before and after Dr. Nasser and it was like night and day. I went and saw Dr. Nasser, within the first five minutes he had completely won me over. He actually encourages his patients to ask questions and he wants your feedback on what he has prescribed or ordered you to have done. The best thing is he actually remembers your medical history and problems from memory without looking at his paperwork or computer. Anyone who has to deal with doctors on a regular basis knows how rare that is and how comforting it is to not just be another face lost in the crowd. It is not just Dr. Nasser that is amazing, all the other doctors and every single staff member go above and beyond the normal  standard. I have also seen Dr. Pena, and he is great as well. He too listens and welcomes your questions and feedback. I have had to deal with more doctors than I can count but I have never seen the quality of doctors and staff members like I have at AVORS Medical. They are located at  42135 10th Street West, right next to the Social Security office. You will be more than happy and very satisfied with your experience there. Dana< /Review>

Maria Davis is also one who I have seen often, and she also cares.
I had some issues with partial medications not being sent. Many times I was without over 3 day weekends. I would be told when I went to pick up from the pharmacy, and the Dr's office was closed until Mon. and Tues. 2 times. This has been resolved. The supervisor who oversees those who send medication has me ask for her every month. It has been my only issue ever in 15 plus years long.

<Pictures>None</Pictures><Review>Dr. Pena ⛑is a great Physician, I relocated from NYC a year ago to Los Angeles CA, and recently purchased a home in Ridgecrest CA. Since, I arrived on the West coast it was a struggle to secure the quality of overall health care I was receiving in New York City for the past 55 years. That all changed when I found Avors medical group in Lancaster CA, The doctor are  extremely knowledgeable about new medical techniques,  treatments, and  holistic methods of care. Dr. Pena, patience and bedside manner is God spent, he's. A good listener and explains things plainly. He never seems rushed. Dr. Pena compassionate is a natural part of his gentle personality. Moreover, his office colleagues and supportive staff are outstanding, courteous and professional. Avors Medical group is providing me with the quality of care that I was receiving in New York City, and I can't be happier. The ones a month drive from Ridgecrest CA to Lancaster CA is more than worth the quality of care I am receiving from Avors. In addition, I have always been seen at my appointment time and they take care of all my insurance paperwork for and medical devices I need and my prescriptions are always sent to the pharmacy in a timely manner.  And if you have questions about your medications after picking them up from the pharmacy, you can call back and the nurse in that department will answer your questions, and will help you resolve any issues or concerns regarding medication.  Avors is a Gold Star Medical Group in my opinion based on experiences with Avors. Greatfully speaking, Cassandra Mazyck<//Review><name>Cassandra Mazyck</name><user_id>117443214633164443828<//user_id><rating>5< /rating>< Gmap_id>

As a new patient at AVORS, I am just learning about the many types of support provided to patients, including monthly appointments with Dr. Thomas Nasser,  collaboration with my neurosurgeon, having staff available to assist with scheduling, medications, and durable medical equipment, and the excellent Acute Rehabilitation Unit at Palmdale Regional  Medical Center. I really had no idea how all-encompassing AVORS is beforehand, and I greatly appreciate all of the assistance being given to me. Thank you!</Review>

<Review>Doctor Thomas Nasser saved my life and got me off all the pain meds I was taking. He even found me a job. I will be eternally grateful for him and his staff! Please be patient with his staff. He takes a lot of medcare patience even though medicare isn't as profitable as other insurance. The only way to be profitable to keep the doors open is to have a lot of doctors that will do the same. That way people who wouldnt have access to good doctors get quality help, but it can be a little hectic and wait times can be longer so please give the staff a brake there doing the best they can! I am so greatful for Doctor Nasser I made his wife Dr. Susan Nasser my PC and I now travel an hour out of my way to see them both! They're just that good!

From the moment you walk into the office. You're treated with care, kindness, and love.
You get the exact same treatment though every part of your surgical procedure, including during recovery  when they take you downstairs to meet with your ride home.
They also call after you go home to check on your well being. I've had several different procedures there, and I've never had to wait long, I've always been treated with kindness, and like they know my time is important to me.<//Review><Name>M.P. L< /Name>< userid>

< Review>
I’ve had a previous hip replacement using the lateral approach. This THR Dr Antebi used the Anterior Approach. Dr Antebi is one of the few Orthopedic Surgeons in California that has the expertise and experience with the Anterior Approach, which is less invasive, faster recovery and no restrictions for avoiding dislocation.
I was climbing the hospital stairs the next morning. Dr Antebi visited me 4 times in the recovery room to check up on me. Then he saw me in my private room the next day. I was discharged that afternoon. It’s now 5 weeks post surgery and I’m back on the tennis courts, which is my passion. Joint pain is gone. Couldn’t be more pleased. I highly recommend Dr Antebi with any hip or knee  joint pain. Improvements in quality of life is quite dramatic.< /Review>

<Text>The staff and outstanding medical professionals are more than simply a cut above. I've used the massage therapist for severe pain issues, and been more than satisfied with significant improvements. Doctor Thomas Nasser, and his Nurse Practitioner Maria Davis have been treating my wife for years. Excellent care both in the office visits, tending to any issues and even making hospital visits when necessary. Excellent relationship and very concerned about the patients. Just haven't seen medical care this good in many years.< /Text></record>

<Review>I had emergency surgery with Dr. Golden. I had a two week follow up with a nurse. The nurse visit was fine. She removed an outer bandage. I was scheduled to see Dr.Golden at 5 weeks post op. Dr.Golden is only at this office once a month. I received a call stating Dr.Golden wouldn’t be in the office that day (Sept 25th). So I was told I would be rescheduled for October 30th. If the appointment actually happens it will have been 10 weeks after surgery before I see the surgeon. I had a severe shoulder injury and a broken humerus. 10 weeks seems like a long time to go after surgery to see a doctor.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Doctor Nasser, the nurses and staff are all very kind and compassionate. They take care of my needs very quickly and take me very seriously. After 31 surgeries and continuous problems you can imagine that I have been to several Doctor's for pain management. I can tell you in all honesty AVORS is number 1 on my list.</Text>

<Review>Professionalism at it's best! Each staff member exceeded their roles, and was competent with their duties. Also, the environment was warm and friendly, as they exhibited genuine care and concern for my unfortunate situation. Dr. Shefey's  old school beside manner made me become confident with our health care system again; and this was my first visit.

<Text>Great service. Once I filled out all the paperwork they got me in very quickly. Once in I was attended to right away. They were very attentive and answered all my questions. I went in for a swollen knee. The doctor (some good looking dude) who looked at my knee had a swollen elbow that he used as a prop to illustrate what was going on in my knee. I thought this is a little like going to a mechanic who has his own car up on blocks, but the truth is he did a really great job explaining what was going on. I hope I never have to, but would go back there in a minute. People in the waiting room, please don't show up in your pajamas! Thank you I will be here all week.

< review>
Thanks to AVORS i am on the mend.  Dr. Alon Antebi, DO performed bilateral hip replacement surgery for me and after the surgery I was as good as new.  He is one of the best orthopedic surgeons I have had and I would recommend him for any orthopedic surgery's.  Thanks to Dr. Thomas Nasser, DO as he helps me out with all of my pain issues and not just pain meds but how to heal, and also his wife Dr. Susan Nasser, DO for being my family doctor.  Doc Susan talks with me on my issues and not just talk at me.   Dr. Jason Heller, MD helped me from with corrective surgery so I can look good again! Dr. Tony Smith, DC works with me from the car accident which caused all 12 surgery's to and the rehab techniques some I have never heard of but works great for me.  AVORS Medical Group has been there for me through all surgery's and rehabilitation to get me walking again.  Maria Davis, NP has been there for me also in using the pain medications to help me and she and Dr. T. Nasser works together not to run for pills but how to use different techniques to heal.  5 STARS FOR AVORS Medical Group 😄😄. The support staff at AVORS are the greatest if I need smile or help they are right there for me.  I do not have to look for any other doctors anywhere else.  This is the A1 medical group.  I recommend any and everyone to go to AVORS Medical Group for all of your medical needs.    Ben Mills, Optician.<//review>

I'm very pleased with Dr. Sherfy. I'm very afraid of needles to the point of passing out. Dr. Sherfy  really was so understanding of my anxiety he talked me through it.

I had a terrible accident on August 9th and shattered my left wrist and ulna bone. I had to be rushed to Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills. I was in utter shock until I spoke to Dr. Alon Antebi. He assured me that I would be able to use my left hand and arm in four months. Two long hours after my accident, I was ready for surgery. It's been almost two months since my accident and I have 40% of my hand strength and usage back. I owe this quick recovery to Dr. Antebi, Justin Short,  Priscilla and all of the medical staff at Avors Medical Group.<//Text>

Dr. Alon Antebi did my hip surgery 8 years ago. Very caring and compassionate and to the point
I recently had knee surgery performed by Dr. Antebi, and im recovering very nicely. Dr. Antebi is the best Orthopedic Dr and Surgeon I've had in my years of going to doctors
AVORS is very organized spacious and clean. The staff is awesome, very professional, caring and friendly. I'd recommend 👌 AVORS to everyone
and among the great Dr's there, my Dr., Dr. Alon Antebi</Review>

<Text>I have been seeing Dr. Thomas Nasser for 13 months, he is the best pain management Dr. I have ever had the pleasure of being a patient of,my doc, he is very special, he will go to any lengths to take care of you, His staff, all of them, are a very special group of young people, I say young people because they are all, extremely accommodating, every member of the AVORS staff, always have smiles on their faces, they go to great lengths to make sure that you are being cared for, from the rope at the front desk. to the young lady who asks you about your pain level, and how well your medicine is working,and rest assured that Dr. Nasser asks all the same questions, it's like there is no way way to miss something, the staff are extremely knowledgable about pain medicine, and what works well with what, no stone goes uncovered, if these people don't have the answer they will get you the answer, quickly.
I could go on and on, just 1 more example of how much Dr. Nasser cares, he talks to you not at you, Even during the worst of Covid, Dr. Nasser would put out his hand,shake your hands and smile,I came to Dr.Nasser, from a doctor,who was all about the money, not my Dr. Nasser, he's all about his patients, I have never seem him lose it with a patient, his smile truly warms the room. You be sure, your going to get the very best level of care, need him at night, just call, it might not be Nasser himself but the doctor cares just as much, he takes time with you, you never feel rushed, everyone in this group is splendid, the girls who make your appointments to the ones that call in your meds, rest assured you are in great hands, his impish smile, goes a long way with me, he puts so much time into the time,he,cares, really cares, he will go the extra 10 miles, he is just a true old fashioned Doctor, who lets you know he can be trusted, so give my doc a try,what do you have to lose, he's just awesome, and easyhe's married .to a lady that works 1 floor up, I can't wait to meet her, she's going to go the extra mile just like Dr. Nasser, I can't wait to meet her but in the mean time, I can rest assured.the male dr Nasser

The whole team is without issue, they will take excellent care of you, go the extra mile

Doctor Tommy is one of the best Doctors I've ever come to know.. I'm not just saying this cause we are both from back east.. every time I been admitted to the hospital he personally came to see me and take care of me. His heart is kind and I truly believe he took his oath to help people.. I wish I could BBQ with him. Hes the kinda guy you wanna be friends with outside of his work.. 2 thumbs up for him 4 thumbs if you wear glasses .. lol.

I get such good concern, respect and care when I go to Doctor Smith. He is an extremely knowledgable and experienced Chiropractor. He definitely knows how to treat my concerns and get my body functioning very well again. I had a very good Chiropractor before I moved to AV. I’ve seen chiropractors who don’t treat thoroughly. Also a chiropractor who used scare tactics to try to schedule more visits than necessary. Doctor Smith is very sincere and honest in his care and concern. Thank you for your knowledge and experience and values, Doctor Smith.</text>

I love this medical group! The staff is always friendly, and professional. Bri was awesome, and was very gentle when she took out my 31 staples. She is a great nurse, and I am thankful I had her for that procedure. Dr. Antebi has been wonderful. He is straight forward, took his time answering all my questions. I can tell he genuinely wants the best outcome possible for his patients, and I truly appreciate his work ethic. I would HIGHLY recommend AVORS!🏆<//Review>

<Review>Ok first let me say that the staff at this place are over the top amazing.
Second DR Nasser  oh my god we're do I start. I started going to avors because I couldn't get answers from the VA. I got a referral to avors. I'm a really picky person when it comes to drs. ( I have had really bad experiences in the past) my first day there DR Nasser walked in and had the biggest smile and the most soothing personality, never in my life have I had a dr that has been so intuitive and listens. I have been going to avors for 7 months now and I have found the best dr I could find it has truly been a blessing. I have answers I have been looking for finally after 5 years of no diagnosis. Dr Nasser is the real deal and I would recommend him any day. Don't hesitate to go see him he's a blessing and has changed my out look on my life. I finally have relief. Thank you avors and Dr Nasser< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Amazing Group of Pain Management & Hand Surgeon!!! I have been seeing this office for 11+ years now and I’m extremely satisfied with the care and service!!! They have been providing me with the highest quality care and helping me with my carpal tunnel, cubital tunnel, and most recently 3 fractured bone 🦴 chips in 2 fingers (R Index x2 + R Middle x1) Dr. Heller is Amazing 😉!!! Dr. Nasser is THE BEST PAIN MANAGEMENT Dr. I HAVE EVER BEEN TO and has been treating my Pain in my Neck Fusion with an Implanted Morphine Pump for almost 5 Years but overall has been treating me for over a decade!!! Dr. Nasser is NOT LIKE “Pill Pusher Doctors” because he Truly Cares about helping people with pain feel better and live better lives through the watchful supervision of their unique pain management needs & Dr. Nasser is also NOT like some Dr.’s who don’t want to give people any pain meds because they are too over cautious about potential abuse issues, because Dr. Nasser is willing to do what he determines a patients needs are and use all available tools to help people live better lives through Actively Managed Pain Care!!!<//Review>

<Review>We saw Dr. Entebe  at AVORS Medical Group.  The visit went well and we were satisfied with the expediency of the visit and the answer to our questions. An Appointment was set for our future procedure and we will tell more after that procedure has been done.  So far we are very satisfied with the office staff and doctors.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>I slipped and broke my wrist. AVORS took me immediately and I saw Dr. Antebi. Who set my wrist,  got me immediate pain management and got me on my way. The entire staff ( especially Brie in prescription care) took great care of me.
Highly recommend this practice!< /review><name>Teri Salvesvold</name>< Rating>

I had my right hip replaced by Dr.Antebi on May 8th, as an outpatient, and was able to walk without assistance upon awakening.  Of course I did have some pain, which is normal.  I went home, followed my instructions for physical therapy, in addition to walking every day.  The only experience I ever had that was better was in 2016 when Dr. Antebi replaced my left hip, because at that time I had such a high tolerance to pain I only felt minimal, if any pain, right after the surgery.</text>

Do not go here! The surgery schedulers told me my portion for the bill was zero and now have to pay almost 500.00.  They are sorry for me being misinformed but oh well.  The scar is also not the way Dr Heller said it would look! Beware!</review>

I’m very pleased with my Orthopedic surgeon Dr.Sherfey who performed hip replacement on me 12/04/19 The first time I meet him he give me good vibes, and to tell you the truth I was just going to hear what he had to say, not going for the surgery but when he started explaining the things, and I said that’s it? I knew right then and there I had to go through it, Stop the pain I was going through...He’s a remarkable surgeon, I would recommend Dr.Sherfey to anyone who wants to live pain free...the staff are great, make you feel welcome! The only thing that I must complain is the waiting period  the last time I was there had to wait 11/2 hours.<//text>

Dr. has treated me the best he can for my condition after my 5 surgeries by other Dr's in which the last had done 3 surgeries to getting it completed with pain why I see  Dr. Nasser for relief without major reconstruction because of Cages placed in Lumbar area.

I have been with this Medical Office for over a year now. I no longer dread seeing my Doctor. Every Employee that I have had contact with has been a pleasure. Very kind & professional. After check in while waiting for my Doctor I listen to the Staff outside & I marvel at how happy & cheerful they sound. It says alot to hear the happy Staff because that tells me they have a great Supervisor that they work for. I also hear other People who are waiting for the Doctor complain about the wait time. I know being in pain is unpleasant but my Doctor takes the complaining in stride and is cheerful and upbeat always. I am treated with respect & compassion. The goal is always to get me healed and moving forward in my Health. The plan is discussed, agreed to and very encouraging. From the time of arrival the first impression is welcoming & warm. Check in & taken to the back I am always asked "How are you today?" And that's not just a standard greeting. They really want to know! And upon conclusion, making my next appointment I am asked what works best for MY schedule?  Yes I reccomend this Company. Be prepared to wait a little time. Enjoy the T.V's in the Waiting room or enjoy a magazine or book. It is worth the wait.</Review>

<Review>My husband has been a patient of Dr. Nasser for more than 7 years after an amputation and terrible phantom pain. Dr. Nasser and his team have been compassionate, supportive, and have continued to explore options and give us hope. We can't tell you how important AVORS is to our entire family.</Review>< time>

I’m very pleased with my Orthopedic surgeon Dr.Sherfey who performed hip replacement on me 12/04/19 The first time I meet him he give me good vibes, and to tell you the truth I was just going to hear what he had to say, not going for the surgery but when he started explaining the things, and I said that’s it? I knew right then and there I had to go through it, Stop the pain I was going through...He’s a remarkable surgeon, I would recommend Dr.Sherfey to anyone who wants to live pain free...the staff are great, make you feel welcome! The only thing that I must complain is the waiting period  the last time I was there had to wait 11/2 hours.<//review>

< Review>
From Jennifer being super kind at the front desk to Heather making me an immediate appointment to Bree and Lacey taking excellent care of me in the office,  the experience here at Dr. Antebi’s office could not be better.
Combined with Dr. Antebi’s extreme skills, this is a dream team.
Thank you guys.<//Review>

I have been a patient of Dr Antebi for about a year now he has replaced my knee and I have gotten PRP which by the way both have been very successful. But I cannot stop there because his office staff needs to be commended I can speak on at least 4 off the top of my head being Brianne, every time I step in AVORS i’am treated so well by all the staff . I come in they remember me , ask me how I’m doing always have made my visits to AVORS nothing short of the best customer service ever ! Dr Antebi you and your staff are the BEST !!</Review>

< review>
My moms dr works very hard trying to offer her many things to improve her life. She does not always show the desire to exercise but wants to do something. I just have not found what besides the kitchen. Shes a great cook, but im afraid she'll knock the pot down on herself, so i offer exercise to help her to stand when she has to stir food on stove. Were stuck at trying to do exercises.                           You guys are great only once in awhile the super long wait kills her. She gets very uncomfortable in chair for over 30 mon.  Thanks so much for your help with her issues and pain.🙂<//review>

My husband and I go to Dr Antebi, and he is absolutely the best Dr. We've ever had. I was suffering so badly for years and all the drs told me I had a lumbar problem and Dr Antebi told me I needed a hip and the pain was gone that day after surgery. I couldn't believe it. He is so caring and so gentle I just can't say enough about him. He has also helped my husband with his knees. He's just wonderful.< /Review>

< review>
I will be forever grateful. To Dr. Antebi who  went out of his way to perform a badly needed bilateral knee replacement  under constrictive time and pressure by my insurance coverage. His work is unbelievable! I was able to walk 40 feet 12 hours after the surgery was done without pain. I am truly  amazed by his work.
I know this is hard to believe, but I had witness one of his patients right after surgery who claimed to be pain free after undergoing the same procedure. Truly remarkable.< /review>

<review>Not rating surgeons, but the waiting is horrible. Appointments set when your surgeon is not available! re-scheduled a couple of times. Waiting over 2hrs. to be seen. Say there are busy and their systems are constantly down. At least the times I was there....</review>< Pictures>

<Text>This is a place to avoid like the plague. I went there after a fall at my house to find out if that fall had effected my hip implant. First I waited for a long time to see a doctor, then he was very rush-rush to get done with me and his recommendation was "Don't fall that often" as I had one other fall before the one where I mostly got my spine hurt. Obviously I had to see another orthopedic surgeon, so this was a complete waste of time.
And now imagine - they charged me nearly $800 for it! I requested a justification of the cost because $800 for 10 minutes makes an hourly rate of $4800 and that seemed a bit stiff. They were completely unresponsive - never heard from them and I thought there was some reasonable behavior on their side - but no - they immediately sent the amount to a collection agency which also did not react to my and my attorney's inquiries. I ended up with a bad mark on my credit report by these crooks.
Avoid at all costs.<//Text><Response>None</Response><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

< review>
Myah* the friendly nurse... Dr. Nasser is a great Dr. Providing 5 star care, but I would like to describe my experience with Myah.

I have been dealing with chronic pain, pain managment, pharmacies, insurance companies and doctors offices staffs for about 5 years now, and Dr. Nasser and his staff "is second to none" truly the best in all they do, they have been my care provider since Aug 2016. Behind every great physician is a greater staff, Myah the call nurse is the saint that handles issues that patients may have outside regular scheduled appointments. If you have an issue and call in this is where your call is transferred to.  While being on suboxone I have had several occasions where I had issues with refills I.e needed prior approvals, needed early refill due to fear of running out while on travel, ive had issues with my insurance, and several times I procrastinated  making my follow up Appointments that would put me in jeopardy of running out of my medication before I could be seen. And every time I called on her for help she has always responded back within the hour or at the next business day at the latest with good news... If you have an opioid dependency or have ever been on an opioid medication then you can understand the anxiety that you experience when running out of meds when you are on vacation or when on travel for work. But unlike my past experiences with other health care providers of being treated like a junkie and getting the run around or Just getting the infamous sacastic " sorrry but there is nothing I can do"..  Well when dealing with Myah that is never the case she has always, "Quickly" responded to my requests and made every effort to reslove the issue and get answers even when it was my neglegence that put me in most of my uncomfortable situations. She should be recognized for her ability and competence in medicine, and her professional conduct she always displays towards patients, treating us with dignity and respect. Thank you avors staff.<//review>

This office needs a serious improvement on patient management.  My appointment was at 2:40 pm, came here 15 minutes early waited until 3:20 pm.  I had to complain to get in the small patient's room at 3:30 pm.  Not punctual all.  Also there were a few former patients of Dr. Sharfey, they were both complaining about their knee surgeries.  I hope he doesn't screw up my arm.  Seems like all they care about dollars and cents how much they can squeeze out of.  It's now 3:42 pm yet to see the actual doctor.  One hour from my scheduled appointment.</review>

<text>My wife had shoulder surgery. We were the last one in the room. And the last to leave. Once she was done there was no one there to answer our questions about the surgery or should my wife sleep with her sling on when sleeping. The doctor seemed in a hurry once the surgery was done and barely stopped to talk to me about it. It just seemed very unprofessional.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>I don't know about the doctor but me and my husband went in for an appointment at 10:50 today and an hour and a half later we still weren't seen. My husband was in so much pain that he couldn't sit there any longer. I was so disappointed. I woke up this morning saying oh good my husband is finally going to get something done with his knee, and then he couldn't stand waiting. Why on earth would you schedule thirty to forty people at the same time?  And to top it off Dr. Antebi was supposed to be getting off work at 11:30...How on earth could he see all of them in that short of time??? They overbooked which sounds to me like they only care about the money not the patients. So depressed that my husband can't get the help he so desperately needs.<//Review><user_name>Jeannine Geiger</user_name><user>102117856032755966330<//user><response>None</response>< Pictures>

My Primary Medical referred me to AVORS due to a backlog. I saw Dr. SHERFEY for my hip and he was caring, gentle, and for me in for surgery very quick. He has  been a fabulous doctor and I am very happy with the treatment of all the drs, assistants, and all my contacts at AVORS.<//Review>

I've heard people say that if they broke a bone or had any joint or spine problem they would not go anywhere else. I can see why. Highly recommended.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>My experience with Dr Masih was pleasurable, however, far less could be said about the attentive nature of the staff.  First, the selection process of an "in Network" provider was not the first option provided in scheduling a medical procedure thus the consideration of the out of pocket cost to the client was not considered.  Secondly, Upon arriving at the hospital for the second procedure, the paperwork noting the procedure to be performed was not correct; the first procedure was nearly repeated if it weren't for my questioning.  Lastly, the follow up with billing inquiries is/was not processed timely.  I made several calls over a 1 week period (Sadie & Lorraine) to be told the inquiry has not been reviewed and additional time will be needed.  After 4 calls and 9 transfers Office Manager Lydia Baker advised " I am too busy to review your information and I will need to call you back" and without my acknowledgment,  the call was disconnected.  I am hugely disappointed with the level of service received as well as the competence of the staff; I found Lydia to be extremely rude and unapologetic for the delay in the response time experienced.   I would recommend increased customer service training for ALL staff members as well as a review of office procedures regarding timely follow up.<//Review></record>

This clown scheduled me to have my pelvis removed "that's right to cut me in half and I scheduled it" I was in a car acesadent and had mersa in my pelvis the next day I cancelled the serigy and went to Keck usc I am still walking today this was 5 years ago. Don't let him touch you he cares about money and nothing else. That's why he schedules everyone at The same time.<//review>

Absolute worst. They’re never consistent with their coffee taste. I’ve seen them add hot water to coffee because they didn’t have enough.< /review>

I come to this location daily before work. Usually the line moves pretty quickly. On RARE occasions it takes a bit longer. Before 720am you will breeze through the drive through. Staff is always very friendly.<//Text>

Very friendly branch with a drive-thru. A bit slow, but everyone is extremely nice. They try hard to make your order right and will go out of their way to fix an order if there is a mistake. Really convenient branch to visit if you need your coffee on the go< /review>

<review>I do not recommend this Starbucks. They have half of a drink menu available via the app, most everything says the drink is not available at this store. We wait in line, drive up and there is a guy standing outside taking orders for some and not for others. Not sure what the point of this is. He's gawking at women while attempting to aide in taking orders. I would MUCH rather via the normal way at the screen. Anyway, I order my iced drink and it tastes like a pound of sugar so I nicely ask to get a different drink. The same guy from the drive through pops up again and hands me a HOT drink. Why would I want a hot drink when I just traded in an iced beverage in 90 degree weather? Not a good experience at all. I will not be back to this place, that's for sure.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Rude employees who allow aggression and violence on their property. After a confrontation between customers in the drive thru, they just automatically took the loud girls side and didn't actually investigate what happened. They pushed out a loyal paying customer and allowed the instigator to get coffee.< /Review></record>

By far my favorite drive-thru. Although some times the person working the register doesn't move as fast as I would appreciate, especially when I see both my breakfast and drink sitting on the counter. But hey, someone has to remove the mobile order stickers and place them on the bar above the printer.
Suggest to the customer: if you normally budget a 10 minute stop, add an extra 5 for this location.</Review>

I don't really like Starbucks but they always have the friendliest staff and coffee is coffee so I keep coming back. They really are some of the nicest people. I'm not reviewing Starbucks the company, I'm reviewing this singular location. It's also clean and quick with orders. I avoid the drive-thru line and just go inside usually, it's easier.<//text>

This is a newer Starbucks and is located where my favorite Del Taco used to be. It was completely remodeled and is pretty much an overflow from the other Starbucks that's 4 blocks away. Since it was basically gutted and updated, I'm surprised that there aren't many power outlets for patrons to use. Seating is as maximized as it can be, but the 2-3 times I've visited, it still felt like it wasn't enough.
Staff is super friendly and helpful, more personable than other locations, I feel. Food and drink is the expected Starbucks quality. It's an overall nice vibe.< /text>

My favorite in & out STARBUX -- use it a lot. 95% everything 100%. Other 5 % is rare such as an order won't go thru for pickup on computer or I'll get syrup in a latte when I never do (though rare...despite happening today lol). Two thumbs up regardless of rare mistakes.</review>

<Text>Never have I been satisfied with this place. Only reason I kept going back was convenience. Never get the drinks right, and yesterday was it for me. Ordered a soy drink and it was made with regular milk. I can taste it and my daughter had a reaction to it (sensitive to reg milk).

Quick and easy to get to, has a drive-thru for those days when you just don't want to get out of the car. During my experience the staff was super nice and accommodating, one of the drinks wasn't made correctly but they remade it promptly with no issues. That is awesome and thank you for doing it. The seating at this location is fairly big so you shouldn't have a problem bringing a group over to sit down and have a cup of coffee or tea or frappuccino.< /text>

< Review>
Way too slow at the drive through. Every time I come to this location I spend at least 15 min in the drive through . And by at least I mean a minimum. I just left the location and once given my drinks I could tell they were already melted half way. Apparently according to the tag my drunk was made 9 min before handing them to me. The employee appeared stressed too. Maybe they need more help in there.</Review>

They are pretty quick, have visited drive thru. People are friendly and mostly remember to give you a napkin. Good sandwiches and breakfast. Coffee is ways good and so is the baked goods. I like a chocolate croissant not warmed up to avoid chocolate spills and the croissant is still tasty.<//Review>

<Text>Store is always filthy. They usually get my order wrong multiple times per visit. There's always a long wait despite nobody in line. They usually hand you part of your order and then 10 minutes later ask if you're still waiting for something.

<Review>After putting in my mobile order, we sat around with a LONG wait. Finally asked if it was ready - they said no. Drinks keep going out, no names called or updates given despite being right there ... 15 minutes+ later went through the drinks and found my now cold hot drink. When opened - my venti had less in it than a grande would!

Asked them to remake it, and they got annoyed that "its from whipped cream" and "that's normal"... nearly half full?! They finally remade it and did the same thing again. Frustrating and a starbucks we will definitely avoid.</Review>< rate>

It's at the top of the list for design, comfort, and service. Everything is clean and neatly arranged. Also the sandwiches and bakery goods are freshly prepared, daily, and they are delicious. And finally, the service is exceptional. The entire barista are thoughtful, courteous,  and respectful. Their smiles and warm words of encouragement usually light up the day. In the area   of quality customer service, they rate "five" stars.
Review update: June 19th 2019. Occasionally I like to commend the places that I frequent for the good works. Today I would  like to bring attention to exceptional workers at this Starbucks. Both hard-working, ambitious, and conscientious to people they serve above and beyond what I would consider excellence. Cameron, who I have observed, always polite and always respectful, went out of his way to deliver drinks to customers at their table. Sarah, whose eyes and smile could light up the world, has memorized customers names I knew exactly what I wanted before I said a word. This Starbucks still ranks highest in my book. The list could go on and on to include Ben and Patty and a few of the others who I don't know their names-- they are all awesome.</Text>

<Text>One lady gave me a coffee on the house the other day! It’s always super busy, so it takes a little longer - but I work in the customer service business atm so I completely understand how tough it can be, especially it being brand new and in such a large city.

<Text>This location works for me because I park down the street. But, there's a barista with attention seeking behaviour. It's annoying and it makes me feel uncomfortable. Ideally, I wish he would transfer to another store.<//Text><UserId.>112846441859686990095< /UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Cute place, but when I went in to get a hot chocolate with hazelnut, Chelsea asked if we wanted mocha in that, which was confusing. When we got our drinks, the labels didn't say hot chocolate anywhere on them, and it tasted like hazelnut in milk. Not bad, but not what we ordered.</Review>

<Date>1548173656705< /Date><rate>5</rate><Review>This review is more for Lanie the barista than it is about Starbucks. I go to Starbucks because I know what to expect everyday- and it's generally perfect. If the coffee shop itself requires a specific review (ie: cleanliness, service, speed) I'll usually speak up. This store is brand new. I've never been before- it's quite nice, bright and clean. But one thing sticks out. Lanie. A good morning to EVERY SINGLE PERSON that walks in the door. She makes drinks, while effortlessly checking in with each person- BY NAME- to let you know your drink is on it's way. Also, "good mornings", "have a great day", and "see yas!" can be heard across the store. What a refreshing experience. Thank you, Lanie for a fabulous start to my day. After fighting traffic to get here- you're a breath of fresh air. Faith in humanity restored. Corporate- are you listening?<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I pulled up in the drive-thru to pay for my drink and handed the employee, a sneering, rude, man named Sam my card. Sam meant to punish me because I wasnt a parade of smiles for his overly-enthused and fake retail personality. He asked me what I had ordered. I told him. He smiled and said, "I figured....just wanted to make you say it, tee hee!" At that point I grew angry and demanded my credit card back which he didnt seem prepared to do unless I played his little game. I'm sorry but if youre going to bully customers for your emotional succor and get your rocks off that way, you haven't any business working in food or retail. I sincerely hope the manager of this location fires this completely petty and mean-spirited Sam.<//text>

I also feel safe since they are implementing social distancing and following proper protocol. All of them are wearing face masks.

Olivia was very helpful and were able to answer all my queries.

Lastly, the clinic is just a few minutes away from our neighborhood.

Highly recommended.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80857334c144ae0b:0x6eb2a0487141eb0f</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<pics>None<//pics><review>Dr. Ebright is very professional, efficient and warm to her patients.  She is quick, energetic and cheerful.   She clearly explains the results of a client's eye exam and points to things that would be of potential concern.  She is honest and one can see that she truly cares for her patient's eye needs.  Her supporting staff is courteous, friendly, and efficient.  Her clinic is prompt with their follow-ups.  Her clinic is very clean and strictly adheres to the rules of social distancing and temperature checking at entrance.

Immediately after a visit, my family gets a questionnaire as to how well our glasses or contact lenses fit to ensure that we received good quality wears.  Her clinic also gives out a questionnaire on how satisfied we were with our recent visit.

Dr. Ebright's Optometry Clinic ensure that their patients are satisfied.
That is very important to us.</review>< rate>

<Text>We have been going to Ebright Optometry for many years. When you enter the office you can feel like you are coming home. They greet you by name, their customer service is outstanding, their professionalism is always appreciated, and they listen to your every concern that you may have. I have a family history of glaucoma and they always make sure to note down my current eye history and the histories of my mother and sister. They also make sure to evaluate every thing that they can to make sure that I am aware of my current status  and if I need to change anything regarding my eyecare. Ebright Optometry will always be our number  one choice in eyecare.< /Text>< pictures>

Dr. Ebright, Dr. Yu in including the entire staff are tremendous, fantastic.  The best optometrist I have been to in the Vallejo area.  The office is in a good location with ample parking. The staff is very personable, knowledgeable and helpful.  Dr. Ebright and Dr. Yu always discuss my examination results in detail in addition to any treatment  options.  I will always use Dr. Ebright, Dr. Yu and Ebright Optometry for my eye sight needs.< /text>

I have been a patient at Ebright Optometry for the last 18 years and the service and care put into every appointment is the best I have ever experienced compared to other optometrists. Dr. Ebright ensures the best prescription and I have had nothing but crystal clear vision and pleasant visits to the office!</Review>

Overall it was a nice experience. However, I was taken aback by the response I received when I asked if the $370. 00 frames I selected would be ordered new? I was shocked at the response that Ebright Optometry typically uses the display frames when filling new prescriptions, but if I requested new THEN she would do it.  I was being charged full price and you were going to provide me used frames - not good.  I did not appreciate that and I can't say that I would recommend anyone based on that alone.  You may want to consider making it known that this is your standard practice.  Thank you.<//text>

Friendly staff, easy to make appointments. Have seen Dr. Ebright  for over 15 years. Always listens to concerns, has proven to be flexible.  If you are looking for a local excellent Optometry office, pick this one!< /Text>

The staff here are exceptional, I have been going here for most of my adult life as well as my children and we will continue to. They are always friendly, knowledgeable, and easy to work with. Dr Ebright is such a sweet heart and so is the other Dr I forgot her name but they always make sure you are well informed on any decision whether it be for glasses or contacts and they are willing to let you try out different brands of contacts until you find the right one for you. I appreciate everything that all of them do and for being such an outstanding practice!!!</Text>

Ebright Optometry and its entire staff is amazing. I've been with this practice for 3 years now and I wish I had found them sooner. They take their time with you and never make you feel rushed when trying to pick out new glasses. They assist you during the process and ask what type or style of glasses you're looking for and will pull different suggestions, which I personally find very helpful. Great selection! If you're looking for a local optometrist in Vallejo, this is the place to go.</review>

<Text>Great service, friendly staff, fast in receiving the glasses! I was very appreciative of their willingness to accept the voucher from the agency thy helps the poor! There was no other way I could have afforded such great glasses. They have a terrific selection to choose from at very reasonable prices. If I move back to the area, I would gladly see them again! Thanks for your business.</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>My husband and I have gone to this office since early in our marriage almost 14 years and they are wonderful!
The staff is always kind and welcoming and very knowledgeable. I really like their follow up and constant contact and have always received my glasses earlier than promised!
Both my husband and I wear glasses and we get annual exams for the kids also and they work great with the kids as well.
I'm so glad to have an office that makes us feel comfortable from the moment we call to set appt. This was a great find for us so many years ago!< /Text><rate>5</rate>< pics>

<Review>Dr. Ebright and her staff are fantastic.  The best optometrist I have been to in the Vallejo area.  The office is in a good location with ample parking. The staff is very personable, knowledgeable and helpful.  Dr. Ebright and Dr. Yu always discuss my examination results in detail in addition to any treatment  options.  I will always use Dr. Ebright and Ebright Optometry for my eye sight needs.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>A great little place that has really nice doctors. We had Dr Yu and she was thorough and kind. The assistants were all nice. Only complaint would be the cost. I got my glasses thru Costco last time and forgot how expensive it is to go thru my VSP insurance. Frames I loved were $305 and insurance covers $140. Then co-pays on upgrades like anti- reflectives and polycarbonate which were all included in Costco price. Overall it cost more to use my benefits....<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>The best Optometry practice in Vallejo. My husband and I have been patients of both Dr Lieberman and Dr Ebright for 15 yeas plus. The level of accuracy taken by both to ensure correct eyeglass and contact lens prescription ensures optimal results the first try eliminating the need for return visits for corrections. The timeliness and professionalism of the Ebright team is an intrical part of this well organized Optometry team. They are trustworthy and fair, you can consider yourself fortunate to have found them to provide your Optometry care needs.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Text>Wonderful experience.  Doctor Liberman has been seeing me for over 14 years and has been beneficial in helping me improve my vision.  He goes above and beyond to help me care for my eyes.  He even attended my LASIK procedure knowing that I was a bit nervous (which was a few towns away.)  I would highly recommend Dr. Liberman for his caring personality and his superior knowledge of the eye.  A friend initially recommended Dr. Liberman and his staff to me.  I appreciated the suggestion years ago and would like to recommend Dr. Liberman to anyone looking for an eye doctor.  So far, several of my friends are his patients and we are all happy to have Dr. Liberman looking after our eye health.<//Text>< Pictures>

My wife and I have been patients of both Dr. Liberman and Dr. Ebright.  My wife started with Dr. Liberman around 1979.  We believe they are the best - always providing excellence in caring for our eye health.  Most recently my 89 yr. old father-in-law who was visiting from out of state saw Dr. Ebright for an exam and upon leaving the office he stated that this exam was the BEST, most thorough that he had ever had!</review>

My family and I have been Dr. Ebright's patients soon after moving to the bay area in 1999.  The kids are all grown up now; but my wife and I are still loyal patients and can't think of going anywhere else.  It's been a great experience with both the Doctor and the staff at Ebright Optometry.  Thank you for being there for us.< /review>

<text>Dr. Liberman is a very good and caring eye doctor. she is very gentle. The office staff is also very nice and professional. The office is very clean and warm.  I was glad that I chose Dr.Liberman when I was looking for an eye doctor. My previous eye doctor was in San Francisco where I use to live. I have been in vallejo for 16 years and was tired of commuting to San Francisco. I made a very good choice in choosing her. I would recommend her to anyone looking for a eye doctor in the vallejo area.</text>< Pictures>

My wife and I were searching for lunch one day and decided to try the new Japanese place, Sansai, on a whim. The interior is clean, not too busy, with attractive tables and booths. An open kitchen so you can see that the cooks are being honest with a cold bar behind glass holding the salad options. I must say I was a little confused by the ordering process, but really it's straight forward. I'm just a little dumb.
We ordered a chicken plate and some kind of a sushi roll (I can't remember now to save my life!). Both were excellent and tasted fresh. I was a little concerned about ordering sushi rolls, and not just a plain old California Roll that you can get from a gas station, but with actual sushi fish on it. Luckily it tasted fine and was not tainted or old. I really liked the salad that came with the entree, and the tomato and cucumber salad on the side. Chicken was not fatty or dry. It was great! We spent about $17 for 2 of us to share a lunch, so it's definitely on the pricey side, especially for a place that comes off as a quick-serve restaurant. But the good news is that the food is good so hopefully this place does well and keeps Restaurant Row looking great!< /Text>

The food was pretty good but they were a little heavy on the salt which I should not have in my diet.</text>

<text>We came in on a Saturday afternoon in a party of 8 friends and family members, the place is very clean and quite, servers are extremely polite and professional. We ordered salmon, tuna, and shrimp shushi, a couples of salad, and a few bowls of spicy and non-spicy ramen, every dish is in excellent quality and we are extremely satisfied, the total cost is very reasonable given the quality and quantity of the food. This place certainly has the highest quality/price ratio of the numerous Asian restaurants I personally visited in recent past. Will definitely come back when found myself in the area again! Highly recommend to all who are looking for a good quality Japanese meal, excellent and fast service, and affordable budget !< /text>< username>

<Review>What ever happened with quality???
We came to this place many times since they opened. Steak teriyaki sucked and didn't cook well at all. Tonkatsu ramen?? I never found tonkatsu ramen with clear and thin soup base. Pot stickers are so small for $3, seriously?? Go buy it at costco! so What ever happened with QUALITY?? So today is the last time we come here.< /Review><Name>Jason Heesch</Name><Response>None<//Response>< Rating>

I will never go to this location. My boyfriend decided to give this place a try and we stood in line while the cashier had a conversation  with someone who wasn't even ordering food. Super rude!< /Text>

Want value?  Yes, SanSai!

Want delicious food?  Yes, SanSai!

Want a quick meal?  Yes, SanSai!

Will we, Cobra Kai, beat the Miyagi Dojo at the All-Valley Karate Tournament?  Yes, SanSai!

SanSai is a quick casual Japanese food spot, located in Lakewood's Restaurant Row (aka Candlewood St.) across the mall.  Specials galore, including daily, lunch & Happy Hour.

Spicy miso ramen-
With a cool overcast day & myself feeling a little chilly, I knew a nice bowl of piping hot ramen would be in store for me.  SanSai has tonkatsu & spicy miso as their ramen options.  Spicy miso is my go-to everywhere, so spicy miso it was.  In a large bowl, the steaming soup of happiness was plentiful.  While the ramen could've been a little more al dente for my personal taste, the chewiness was there and the tender slices of pork were succulent and delicious.  The half egg was a bonus, as I know some popular ramen shops charge extra for that.  Upon receiving my order, I asked for chili oil, as I didn't want to use Sriracha because of the preservatives.  A sauce cup of chili oil was quickly brought to me, upon which I dumped the entire contents into my spicy miso, delivering the right amount of heat I desired.  I happily slurped & gulped it down to the very last drop.  For $8+, the spicy miso ramen was good & about on par with dedicated ramen restaurants.

Plentiful seating, with booths, stools & a communal table.  Service was good.  The menu states ramen takes about 10-15 mins, of which I only waited approximately 5 mins or so for mine.  I was the first customer of the day, however.

Parking is in a private lot, shared by Outback Steakhouse and other businesses.

During my meal of ramen & California roll, I enjoyed listening to Sirius satellite radio on the house speakers.  When I was finishing my soup, it happened.  Yes, it happened!  I was Rick Roll'd!

"Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down.
Never gonna run around, and desert you."

Aye aye, SanSai!  SanSai offers up delicious Japanese food in a casual setting.  I haven't had ramen in a long while, since the LALALA Ramen Pass promo, so SanSai's spicy miso hit the spot.  Add to that the daily, lunch & Happy Hour specials, and SanSai has a new fan.  Quick, convenient & yummy, I highly recommend SanSai!

Well, I'm never ordering the sushi again. I'm actually nervous that I may be sick from eating the gray tuna. Chicken breast was pretty gross too.< /review>

We tried the big name companies, and the rats kept coming back. We do live in Marin near open space, but we don't have to be that nice to the local wildlife. It was bad in our attic. Droppings everywhere! Zabi and his crew vacuumed out all of the droppings and old insulation, rat-proofed every hole, and added R38, 16-inch insulation throughout. Today, Julio came for a follow-up and every trap was empty. Well worth every penny!< /review>

Dave from Attic Star is a very hard worker, personable and really puts forth a strong effort to help resolve rodent issues which can be very complex.

That said it's important to understand that the owner Sean decided 8 months ago that the company will not take jobs on homes that have skip sheathed roofs as work can not be guaranteed.

Many older homes dating from the 80's and older especially if they have tile roofs that have not been re-roofed will not be something they can help with due to the high level of complexity in alleviating entry points.

This means that unless you have full sheathing on your roof (full plywood pieces under your roofing) that this is not the right company for you.

Also they have a minimum fee of $2000.00 (Two Thousand dollers) so if you think your issue may be a smaller one or you don't have a larger budget perhaps just have them out for a consult to learn more then hire a handy person to help seal problem areas.

These guys are quite intelligent, real chess players so for the most part I'm sure you would be in good hands if you qualify as a customer.

Do your homework, educate yourself ahead of time so you can understand a bit about your issue and methods for resolving it.

They turned me down as a possible client all together due to my skip sheathed roof which is mostly understandable.

The reason I say mostly is beacause despite the fact that the attic can potentially be used for them (rodents) to access the crawl space (under the home) using the bathroom, laundry room and kitchen plumbing vents if they were not properly sealed at time of construction. To go up and down within a home inside the walls.

It is possible to seal these vent areas to isolate the attic from the crawl space. Firecode calls for these gaps to be sealed in modern homes from the 80's and later. So the crawl space should be able to be sealed off seperately from the attic to help mitigate issues regardless of a skip sheathed roof.

These being the facts I was still turned down as a potential client to help with the crawl space as I requested until I can finish sheathing my roof in its entirety.

This is their right of course just disappointing for me as an owner who is trying to alleviate a problem.</review>

Chuck/Alex, thank you.  Roughly 18-months ago we decided it was time to replace our old blown-in insulation with nice thick R-38 "Batts."  Immediately we noticed our energy consumption reduced, making this a clear upgrade for any future home we own.

With that said, Chuck really went above and beyond my expectations for customer service.  After initial installation, Chuck followed up and made sure I was satisfied with the results.  I asked how long it normally took for the Batts to fluff up properly...rather than giving some answer like "wait a little longer," Chuck recommended his guys review during the follow up visit.  There were a few locations where the insulation snagged while fluffing and his guys took care of it.

Second instance was when we noticed a critter running around the attic.  We called Chuck about a year after initial install and he sent over his guys to check mesh around crawl space and roof vents.  A few vents had been damaged, so his guys put new screens on...no charge! ("killer" warranty with Attic Star)

Third time we noticed a second critter rummaging around...Called Chuck, and found out our bathroom contractor used a roof vent without mesh!!! What the heck! Perfectly contained with Attic Star then our contractor messes things up.  Chuck brought his guys out and found the entry point almost instantly! These guys have really stood by their warranty, even when it wasn't their fault.  A+++ customer service.  Will use again!</Review>

<Date>1476834408246<//Date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>I wanted to get my crawlspace and attics cleaned.  I invited multiple companies for getting a quite and co-incidentally, Attic Star was the first one in the list.  Ron from Attic Star visited my house for inspection.  He did a great job explaining the issues with my crawlspace and attics.  He went over all the options and gave his recommendation. To support his recommendation he took detailed pictures and showed it to me, this was particularly helpful.  It helped me work with my budget and solicit his opinion on the parts that I wanted to get done now and the ones that I could postpone.

I decided to cancel the other appointments and just go with Attic Star.  Attic Star installed a new insulation in my crawlspace.  They cleaned up the rodent droppings and old insulation, sanitized, closed all the holes and installed new insulation.  I have a old house (60's built), the sanitize part was really great.

After the work was done, Ron walked me over all the work done.  I am glad I went with Attic Star, everything was smooth and very professional.< /review>< Pics>

We looked at a few companies before we decided to use Attic Star. They did a thorough job with sanitizing and sealing openings before blowing new insulation into our Attic. Excellent job is cleaning everything up before they left. Highly recommended for their thoroughness and professionalism< /Text>

The only thing more amazing the the gentlemen themselves is the quality of their work and their high-class attitude. Ron gave us a thorough inspection and a great estimate, and worked to accommodate our crazy schedule. Joy and his crew of 8 (yes, he had 8 guys) worked from dawn until dusk (actually way later!). They didn't quit until the job was done. Our attic smells fresh and the batting looks like pink fluffy snowdrifts. Not a trace of trash or a hint of rodent smell lingers. Even after only a day, the house is so much warmer! Take that, PG&E! I'm energy efficient now!!! Ron promised a 50% reduction in energy costs, and I believe it!<//Text>< pics>

Attic Star did an excellent job cleaning out and insulating the attic in our home. It was full of very old insulation, debris from a re-roofing and probably 20+ years of inattentive care from the previous owner.  Ron and his team were on time, worked hard and were very informative. Ron in particular had answers for all my questions. I highly recommend their services.<//Review>

Fantastic job done! plugged many unknown issues in insulation, gaps in both attic and crawl. Probably this would put an end to many rodents that called my home a home :)

Good job again. Both Ron & Joy and rest of the team. Said for a whole day, left me with few more hours to catch up on rest.< /text>

The guys at Attic Star are a humble, hard working team.  They don't forget that the work they are doing is inside my home and were very careful about keeping everything covered and cleaning up after they were done.  They even vacuumed beyond what was expected and it was appreciated.  A tough job in the heat, but they got it done!<//review>

They gave me a great price. They showed on time. They did what they said they were going to do. They were friendly and they met my expectations and that is sometimes a hard thing to do. I recommend them without hesitations.<//text>

Joy and team were super thorough and did a great job cleaning up my attic and sealing up the many entry points they found for rodents to enter. Would definitely recommend them to others.<//Review>

Joy and his crew I hired to insulate the walls in the office in one of the buildings which I manage. They work for Attic Star and they have done a fantastic job for me. Beside their professionalism they were extremely friendly working extremely efficient . The entire crew deserves the highest rating for the project they completed for me.
Thank you and good luck in the future!< /review>

These guys went above and beyond, arriving early in the morning and working throughout the entire day cleaning up every nook and cranny in both my detached garage and attic. Plus my insulation has never looked fluffier. They were friendly and approachable and updated me throughout the day. Highly recommended.<//text>

Fast attention and detailed quote from Joy.  Arrived early with a very professional crew. Protected my belongings, great removal job on a very old attic, thorough cleanout, detailed installation of new insulation, excellent cleanup.  Great job all around.  Thanks men.
NOW... a month later I had them back to do the crawl space after being so wonderfully happy with the work in my attic.</Text>

<text>Ron and team were fantastic.  Ron came to do a very detailed inspection of the attic after we had a rat problem.  He was very honest with what needed and didn't need to be done in terms of the insulation and also rat proofing the house.  Long story short, Ron and team came in to remove all the old and infested insulation, sanitized the whole attic and crawl space, and put in new insulation.  What I was most impressed with was the attention to detail and the ease of working with Ron.  Would highly recommend Attic Star and Ron in particular to anyone looking to replace their insulation.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Joy and his fellows totally did a great job on my attic. Sealing even the smallest openings/etc so that no mice or rats get in. Also, they filled it with 12.5" of insulation and did it much sooner than the time they had promised. They also came in very early!

When I purchased my home a year and a half ago, I found out that the home had a serious rodent issue that the previous owner had not taken care of. So with a massive amount of rodent droppings in the attic, I knew it was time to get it taken care of before the rodents came back. I made an appointment with Attic Star to remove all of the rodent droppings in the attic and crawl space, sanitize the space, seal the holes, and clean the ductwork. Joy and his team came through and were very prompt, professional, and efficient. The service was excellent and I am very happy with the results.<//text>

They should really be called "Attic Stars"!
Ron has been very professional and friendly from the day he came to bid the job of wall, attic and underfloor insulation. He met my budget by working with me on price point and has a great team of hard-working guys.
They came to remove the attic insulation today to enable me to work on electrical upgrades and also competed the wall insulation which I am already noticing has great sound proofing benefits.
They will return to do the underfloor and attic insulation after my remodel work is done, the perfect end to a big project!
Don't hesitate to call Ron. He will certainly be the go-to guy I'll recommend to anyone I know.< /Text>

Excellent service!  Joy, the lead person, led his crew well.  They arrived on time and did a very complete job in removing the old insulation, sealed cracks, installed new installation plus cleaned all our air ducts.  We were also allowed to look at the attic before the work began and after the work was completed.  We are completely satisfied with the job done.  Thanks to the whole crew and especially Ron, who provided the estimate and explained in detail how the whole job will be done.<//Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>Attic Star have done an excellent job of cleaning my attic and crawlspace. They removed old insulation and sanitized the area. They also sealed all the holes and air leaks. Excellent work on installing new installation nice team work did the entire job a single day ( almost 11.5 hours they worked) . Very patent and responsive to your needs.

They are best in terms of price (I had other quotes as well for the same they beat all of them).

Overall Excellent work quality and they got the job done in right way :)<//review>< pics>

Ron from Attic Star was great. He and his assistant came for a consultation for putting insulation in our attic and spent time explaining the results, telling us what he would do, and breaking down the estimate. When we asked if he could put some plywood down on top of the insulation so we could use the attic space for storage, he agreed to do so and gave us the information necessary to buy plywood (size, number, thickness of pieces).

When it came time to do the work, he was punctual and efficient. He came on time, installed, showed us pictures of the finished attic and left within a few hours.

Overall we are very satisfied with Ron's professional and friendly work and we would recommend him to anyone looking for insulation professionals.<//text>

They guys did a great job removing 30+ year old insulation and all the rest of the junk in our attic, and installed new insulation for us.  The price was competitive and they cleaned up as promised.< /Text>

Joy and his crew were very polite and professional. They cleaned, sanitized, and perfectly installed the R-44 insulation I had requested. Joy was especially good at identifying and screening or sealing any gaps where rodents might enter. He found and sealed many openings that a pest control "professional" missed. Joy was excellent at explaining the work and keeping me informed as to their progress. he and his crew take pride in their work and it shows. Any questions or concerns are completely addressed. Additionally, I received before and after images. I am thoroughly satisfied with the results and would recommend them highly without hesitation.</Text>

Attic Star was awesome to work with. Everything from the estimate to the work getting done was done quickly and professionally.

Ron, the person who did our estimate came on time (actually super early) which was great and crawled down into our crawl space to see what kind of work that needed to be done, took pictures, and gave us a fair quote.

Sean and his crew came a day later and they were great too! They arrived an hour earlier than the time they were supposed to come, which again is great as a customer. They were suited up and ready to work! They were done faster than I expected, provided pictures for us, and were very professional.

I would not hesitate to refer Attic Star for a job in anyone's home.
-Thank you<//Text>

Attic star did a great job with their recent insulation replacement of our attic. Our 65 year old home had basically no insulation left in the attic and it was leading to extremely high temperatures in the upstairs floor of our home.

The crew was professional, work was well done, properly cleaned up after and the price was extremely reasonable.

Time will tell if this properly solves our home over heating issue but it's a good start and will likely help us in the winter a bunch to.<//text>

Ron and team were professional!

Arrived as indicated after initial call.
Gave me a reasonable quote, and even offered a modest discount for scheduling it the same day.
Returned to complete the work with a larger than normal crew (because they were training some of the new guys).  I didn't mind cause it meant work would be inspected.
Took video with his cell phone for me to review since I could not crawl up into the space w/my 18 month old in tow.
Great working with them.  Would definitely recommend to anyone that needs their type of work completed.

The men were here on time and spent more than 12 hours making sure our attics and crawl space were rodent proof and it was a hot day in July, over 90 degrees! We are happy with their service. I think they cleaned everything up very well and made sure the spaces were sanitized. I would recommend Attic Star to people who want their houses rodent proofed.< /text>

<Review>The work last done in July was unsatisfied.  This time we got Sean to come to complete the work.  He came promptly and help us to decide what to do for the best in our situation.  He started the work immediately and done more than what we expected.  He's polite and professional.  Great employee who can lift up your company's reputation.  Thanks for the good work that can give us peace of mind again.<//Review>< pics>

<Resp>None</Resp><name>Dacia Codina< /name><text>Shawn and his crew showed up promptly at 9am and set to work cleaning out about 1500 sq ft of blown insulation. They began by clearing out 5 Hefty bags of debris left by roofers. Then they began vacuuming and finally disinfected and rodent proofed. The process took the entire day. All of the guys were polite and professional. At the end of the day, they left everything tidy.
There was only one small hiccup which is the reason for the 4, and not 5, star recommendation . Some very minor damage happened to a bedroom ceiling. They of course took full responsibility for the problem. We amicably settled the problem by accepting an appropriate  discount on their fee.
We would definitely recommend Attic Star to friends.<//text><time>1473019242813</time>< user_id>

The other satisfied Yelp reviews were all true...  Today, Joy and Sean arrived promptly, went through the job requirements and then through the house identifying all the vents/ducts that they were going to clean.  They even checked our crawl space to ensure everything looked good down there...  luckily for us crawlspace was good.  At the end of the job, they made sure we were completely satisfied which included the clean-up.

I received quotes from two other companies before selecting with Attic Star. Ron came out a week ago for a consultation and quote. He was honest, knowledgeable, and thorough.  The price he gave was within my budget for a 2,000 square foot home and scheduled for the work to be completed in less than a week.

Sean and his 4-man crew arrived on time.  Similar to Ron, Sean was very efficient, clean, and thorough - prior to the start of the work they laid plastic coverings so my hard wood floors and furniture did not get scratched or dirty. He even identified and fixed key areas where I could potentially have a pest problem that two Orkin employees missed the prior two weeks. Other than the noise from the equipment, the crew worked quietly throughout the entire project. They cleaned and disinfected my attic and crawl spaces prior to laying out the new insulation. Sean also got up on my roof and fixed two ventilators that did not have any screens. Once the work was completed, Sean and his crew cleaned up after themselves.< /Text>

From the beginning to the end I was amazed and soooooo happy with Attic Star.  They came at 9:00 am and worked non stop till 5:00pm only stopped to  eat some lunch.  They were very clean and could not believe what a great job they did, The attic was a mess, needed to be cleaned, and needed new insulation and had mold, fungus, rats had made it their home so you can imagine how bad it was.  Now it is clean and rodent proofed and sanitized.  They even cleaned my dryer vent and all my vents. They deserve the 5 stars. Joy and his helpers were awesome they were willing to help me even  do little things like trying to move my refrigerator clean behind it, they are so thorough, I would recommend them to everyone..............thank you Ron & Joy and your team.< /review>

Ron and his team came puntually this morning. They took down the old insulation and wrapped them in garage bags. The work was done quickly and neatly. They identified the opening in the attic where the rats entered and caused damages. Ron took pictures and explained to me meanwhile his team sealed each opening with mesh wires. Now the work is done and they are cleaning up the carpets for us. I'm very happy with their help. Ron is guaranteeing this work for one year; the insulation for 45 days.<//Review>

I went a few steps in the attic, not easy to go all the way, and it's almost perfect. Later, they started blowing the insulation and again I was asked to check. Since attic is full of insulation, i cannot go inside, but, i had a glance from attic's entrance and it appeared good. They vacuumed all over the place before leaving. Also, they did rodent proofing on roof and I have a 1-year warranty for all the work. Nice Job.</text>< pics>

<Review>These guys are awesome. We first checked them out because of the reviews. Ron came and did an half hour inspection and gave us a fair assessment. He didn’t try to scare us, even though in the end we still asked for a big job.

In the end, they came and finished the whole job in one day. We have a decent size house and they re-do all of the insulation, cleaning and vapor barrier before the sun went down, so no complain there. In the end, they let us to crawl into the space with them to show us all the work.

Price is not bad, and now we feel more safe (we don’t like hearing animals scratching under our floor).

One thing though, they really try to ask us to put review everywhere, hence you are reading this.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808e3545c8e9ec93:0x114c9a4a2819060e<//GmapID></record>

Joey and his crew came out to rodent proof our attic, and to blow new insulation today. I addressed my concern with Joey about running into walls and taking great care of our home while they were here doing the work. He reassurred me they will do everything they can to protect the walls, carpet and windows. These guys are great! He did everything I asked. He took pictures to show me where he thinks the rodents were coming in from. After he sealed the holes and sanitize the attic, I was asked to inspect their work. I really didn't want to go up to the attic,so he waited for my husband to come home to inspect their work before the new insulation was to be blown in. I highly recommend Joey and his team. We are very satisfy with their work.</review>

I had some rats activity inside the crawl space a couple of weeks ago. I called Attic Star, talked to David on Wednesday. On Friday, Shawn and another 3 guys came over, gave me an estimate. Shawn is very professional and explained to me in very detailed. Eventually, they gave me a good price to do both crawl space cleaning and changed all of the insulations. They started to work around 10am, and get everything done at 7pm. In all, good and professional job! I would recommend them to the others.< /review>

<text>I feel very lucky to find these guys. I had two referral to for Attic/Crawlspace insulation companies by a friend but I decided to go with Attic Star. They removed all the old insulation from the attic and completely cleaned it up. They covered the entire attic with blown-in insulation and batts (R38) in some parts. Now the attic looks very clean. They also did a good job of sanitizing the attic and the crawl space. They used R19 batts for the crawl space and the job looks very clean to me. The also closed all the gaps to rodent proof the attic and the crawlspace. Overall I am very happy with my decision and I am looking forward to a warm and cozy winter inside the house. Big thanks to Joy and the team!< /text>< Rating>

<username>Dan A</username><Text>This was an excellent experience from start to finish. We have been experiencing rats in our attic, and I was at quite a loss as to who to call to help us solve our problem. The reviews looked good for Attic Star, and I am so glad I called them. Ron came out first, did an inspection, and clearly explained the process of replacing the contaminated insulation (which was really in bad shape), disinfecting the attic and rat proofing it to prevent further problems. We made an appointment to do the work a few days later. On that date his crew arrived promptly and worked hard all day. Ron checked in during the day to ensure we were happy with the progress of the work (we were!). These guys are hard workers, and very pleasant to be around. I recommend them highly, with the highest recommendation possible.< /Text><gmapID>0x808e3545c8e9ec93:0x114c9a4a2819060e< /gmapID>< Response>

<text>We called Attic Star after  a harrowing experience with raccoons in our attic . Ron arrived at our home and did a thorough inspection of our attic and then explained everything that needed to be done and why. We decided to use them because of the yelp reviews and the professional and polite manner that Ron showed during his visit. They accommodated us by scheduling on a Sunday. On the date of the appointment they arrived 20 minutes early. In a fast and efficient manner they completed the job(removing and replacing the insulation, sanitizing the attic,checking and securing any openings to prevent this from happening again. The price was also extremely fair. I would recommend them to anyone. Thank you Ron and your 2 helpers for an excellent job.</text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Attic Star did a very good job of cleaning out our old insulation, rodent proofing and putting down new insulation. The price was fair, not the lowest we found but on par with similar services. Ron and his crew were very accommodating of our scheduling needs and were able to split the job over 2 days as we requested. They also did a very good job of cleaning up after the job. The only issue we had was that during the cleaning, nails from the rafters in our ceiling started poking in through in many places, apparently because they were old and should have been screws, and some of the pot lighting got knocked out of place. Attic star hired someone to come in to fix the issues, which was much appreciated, but was still a bit of an inconvenience. Overall we were satisfied and would recommend them.< /Review>< Pictures>

So me and the miss wanted to get this annoying mold from the ceiling to stop. Previous owner did a janky job on the insulation. Basically put wall insulation instead of the proper amount. Called attic star got appointment right away with Ron. Ron came in was straight forward and gave me estimate. I found it reasonable. The guys came today an hour early which is fine bc I got up early to be prepared. So they went in prep the place went straight to the attic pulled out bag and bags of old insulation. Then vacuumed all the rat poop and rat proof the attic. I like what was done I like that ppl show up early instead of late. And I like the fact they finished early so I can get other things done.

Definitely the ppl to go for attic help.</Text>

We recently bought a bank owned home that was vacant for several years.  During this time about 20 pigeons took residence in the attic where they proceeded to give birth in many nests scattered across the attic, and lets just say they used the bathroom in very square inch of our 5,000 sq ft. attic.

We called another attic service and they came out and took an hour and a half to look around. They said they have never seen a job as big as this one.  During this hour and a half they kept asking a ton of questions and going over the same information which was very interrupting to my day with my toddler. After all of that they and gave us a $15,000 estimate!  What!! We said thanks but no thanks to those guys.

We called Ron and his team with Attic Star and he came out in a day to take a look, and was early for the appointment.  Ron spent about 15 mins in the attic (did I mention the other guys were here for 1 1/2 hours?) and lets just say his estimate was wayyy under 15k for the same job.  Since we booked right then he gave us an additional discount.  Ron also said he had done jobs with rodents and birds much larger than this, which gave me a lot of confidence.  Before he left I asked if he wanted my phone number in case he was running late and he said there was no need because he would be here right on time.
And he was right on time, actually early.  Before they started they put down floor covering and made sure everything was all set up before I left for work.  My husband went home for lunch to take a look at the progress.  Ron likes for you to check their work periodically. We returned about 4 hours later and they were just finishing up spraying the new installation into the attic.  I actually went up into the attic for the first time to take a look. They packed up everything and there was not a trace that they have ever been here expect for the clean attic.  At one point we considered doing the job ourselves, but with the great cost Attic Star can give you, you won't be saving very much doing it yourself. I would highly recommend Attic Star to anyone who has a crappy job that needs a good cleaning "no pun intended!"< /Review>

Little did I know but we had rats living in the attic.
So a friend had recommended Attic Star.
I gave them a call and they were out the next day!
The same day they cleaned out the attic, removed the old insulation, patched up all the entry points for the rodents, disinfected the attic and sprayed all new insulation.
The staff was extremely professional and courteous. They took the time to explain to me step by step the process and answered all of my questions.
They were very affordable and I would recommend their services to everyone.
It has been two weeks since their services and my house is rat free :)<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<review>We called on Attic Star to do a full clean-out out of our attic, including removal of old insulation, patching up holes that rodents, etc. had been using, and disinfecting the surfaces from rodent droppings as well as a clean out of our crawlspace and HVAC system.

Ron and his crew were efficient and thorough throughout the process. During the bid process he explained everything in detail and showed pictures of the current state of our attic (which needed a lot of attention). He explained the entire process step by step and, during the job, he made good on his word to show me the various stages along the way and the work that had been done. They made sure to protect our floors, doors, walls, etc from any potential damage/dirt and cleaned up after they were done.

The only drawback to the entire process was the unnecessary pressure to sign the bid and write a review both on the spot and after the service. These were unnecessary tactics for a company that prides itself on its reputation. Allow the customer some space.

Having said that, Ron and his team did a great job and have guaranteed their work.<//review>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>What a fantastic job!!! Our house is 1977 and the insulation was turning into dust. With the smell of it reaching past the walls I decided it was time to get the old stuff removed,  Joy was here early and ready to get to work. I could not have asked for better service, and Joy and his crew were very polite and professional. I was happy that he kept us informed with the progress of the removal and clean-up of our old insulation and De-contaminating and disinfecting our attic and also the Installation of the new insulation. I feel better knowing the spaces and crevasses are all sealed up to keep out rodents and unwanted pest from our attic and our crawl space under the house. This company takes pride in their work, and they care about the customers concerns and needs. Thanks a million Attic Star for sending Joy to rescue our attic! Super Happy in Tracy, Ca.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808e3545c8e9ec93:0x114c9a4a2819060e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Some of the most unprofessional employees you will ever see. Half of them didn't even have their mask on correctly and one girl was swearing up a storm like a sailor in front of kids. The other employees literally started arguing in front of me while I was doing my transaction. No respect in front of customers at all. Disappointing for such a big company.</text>

If you are looking to have your car windows and or PCH Custom Audio - Long Beach, CA is the man to talk to. Excellent service plus competitive pricing. Just had my car tinted: all windows plus windshield. Fabulous job and his team. Will definitely recommend this place to friends.<//review>

I entrusted these gentlemen with my 2018 Subaru Crosstrek and was not disappointed. The gentleman that helped me answered my million questions and gave amazing suggestions. They made sure I was happy with everything that I got and told me to reach out if I ever needed anything including advice.</Text>

<Review>This place is a RIP OFF I went to buy a light bulb for my front head light (the same head light they sold me which they put on and was also a problem) I told the man in front of the counter that I wanted a light for my front headlight he told me what can of light I need it ,I then told him I didn't know but if he looks me up in THERE computer he can find out because I bought them before... so he did and found it and started searching for the right one (so I thought) when he came back he told me that this light bulb the one he had in his hands was the one for my car so I told him to put them on i left a few days later I had to work early it was still dark outside I started my car and notice that my light that I just bought was on, i guess you can call it light or weak.i went back to try to talk to the gentleman that I did business with but unfortunately he wasn't there after telling a new gentlemen my story he told me that he couldn't do anything for me because I told the man to put the light bulb in.i told him because he told me that it was the right one for my car you people where the ones that put them on, on the first place, I didn't  want to argue so I left .....take my advice DON'T TAKE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY TO THIS PLACE YOU WILL ONLY HAVE REGRET, I HAD TO LEARN THE HARD WAY!!

I just noticed that the only ones that are writing good reviews are the the owners this people are just looking for suckers WARNING DON'T BE THE ONE< /Review>< Pictures>

As I’m writing this review, I’m currently waiting again, for the 5th time this week for my radio to be fixed because it keeps on popping a fuse.

I first stepped in here on a Tuesday, got a few quotes about a couple different radios and was going to be on my way. The manager seemed really aggressive about me getting a sound system installed today and he told me about the financing portion, which I was inclined to do.

I put together a list of items of what I wanted and they said they could easily do that with the budget I was given by the finance company ($1500). They said it’s possible, as I was going through my invoice, they charged me $250 for an amp, which was $60 on sonix electronics. They said they’d price match it, but would have to charge me all these extra fees equaling to the $250 I originally had been charged for the amp. It was confusing, but I guess that’s how they charge for installation? Not really clear how they do things here.

Then, I went ahead with the installation, left the car overnight hoping it would be done the next day. That was not the case, I came back the next afternoon and they said the amp they installed was bad and they couldn’t get another one til the next day. So I decide to come back the next day, because I need my car for work.

I take the car back the next day, around 1pm for the amp install. It took about 3 hours. I drove off thinking I was completely free of anymore mishaps. That was not the case, I purchased a rear view camera and that was never installed. Also my passenger seat belt was removed and never put back.

The next day I had to come back to install the camera and seat belt. This took another 2 hours. I left and after driving a few hours, my radio went out. Probably due to a fuse, so I replaced it. Then that fuse blew out. Now I’m here again trying to figure it out. Today is Saturday, I’ve been in-n-out of this place for 5 days straight. I also told them that my passenger seat motor wasn’t working, they said they don’t touch the seats? How can you take my seatbelt off if you don’t touch the seats?!You’d think for spending close to $2000 in car audio parts we wouldn’t have to deal with all these issues.

Good luck to anyone looking at this place for an easy car audio solution, pretty sure it won’t be easy.

Edit*

So it’s been a few hours since I got my car back. After all the shady stuff that happened to me, I wanted to check and make sure I got everything that was listed on the invoice. I didn’t. I paid for Alpine speakers which are considered high end, I opened my door panels and they’re pioneer. Wow. This can’t be real. I’m sure this is illegal, I’ll contact my lawyer in the morning.</text>

< review>
Today I was just driving down 7th st in Long Beach when I started getting tailgated by a car with very distinctive blue headlights. The car then changes lanes to its left, speeds up to get next to me and begins to drift into my lane while they're right next to me. They then speed up and illegally change lanes mid-intersection to cut me off, nearly hitting me. I honk and pump my breaks so I don't get hit and then  I see the large rear windshield logo: PCH Custom Audio.

Here's some free business advice, stop driving in an unsafe, aggressive manner and represent your brand better. I'm sure your customer service could use some work as well considering your current rating.< /review>

In 2018 I had them install an amplifier and sub. That amplifier that they installed provided power to the existing speakers since it was a five channel amp. Recently I noticed that there was no sound coming out of my passenger door speaker. So I took it to these guys thinking the connection was bad or simply upgrade my speakers. They told me to bring it in so I did. They then told me they adjusted the amp so now the speakers work. Well they work but they sound terrible. I was unsatisfied so I dropped the car off 10am picked it 4 pm the next day told me it worked. Drove off and the speaker still doesn’t work. Long story short. They have no idea what they are doing. Don’t waste your time.< /Review></record>

< Review>
I had really thought this was an excellent place.  But I got a bad experience.
I was double charged to my debit card, when I went to claim the man told me that he had only made only 1 charge.  I waited a few days, and then I spoke to my bank, and they told me (my bank)  that indeed there had been double charge, again I returned to try to solve my problem with the Men (PCH Custom Audio).  And he was not friendly to me, he just answered me.  -Talk to the bank.
If you value your time and money.  Think twice.<//Review>

<Review>To damn expensive for sloppy work. You'll see what I mean. They won't  itemize their invoices. I gave them a list of thing I wanted done ,never completed all the work yet expected payment. My stereo wasn't installed right the first time.I had to come back a second time. For an additional charge of course. This place taught me a lesson.

<Text>As much a I want to give them all stars, I cannot. They have friendly service but unfortunately very slow service. I purchased rims on a Saturday and was under the impression they would have them and installed the same day. After my approved loan for rims, they said they will call me when they'll get here. Was not happy. On Sunday I spoke to a rep and indicated that I forgot to tell them I wanted rims hyper gloss instead of flat mat.. They said no worries they will order hyper gloss. Come Thursday to install, they were flat mat. Was told to be here at 1pm appointment to get me in and out to go back to work, Did not service me until 1:30. After I told them I was on my extended lunch, they did not take that extra step to accommodate faster service. Instead they guys took there lunch knowing I had to go back to work. I can only give them one star. They could have pull one person to complete my installation.< /Text>< UserId.>

<Review>Let me start by saying that I didn't expect much. My previous experience with another car stereo shop two weeks before was not good. They over charged and under delivered. So I came here thinking it would be the same. What a surprise!

They explained all the costs up front, gave me options and let me make my decision. No pressure, no hassle. Although the wait for my turn to have everything installed took longer than I was initially told, they were busy, so I was okay with that.

The owner made a point to ask me how it went and thanked me for my business. Classy. Thanks to the installation staff, they were very helpful.

I will go back for anything else I need.</Review>< pictures>

My 2007 Honda Accord needed some base enhancement so I stop by PCH Custom Audio to see what they have in terms of a amplified subwoofer. They didn't have any but Sam and Oscar, was knowledgeable and very helpful in picking the right amplifier and woofer and an enclosure. I got a Kicker 40KX200.2 amp, a Kicker 43C104 Comp 10" and an enclosure for $200 bucks out the door. He put the speaker in the enclosure for me. I took it home, installed it and it sounds very deep. More than I expected. I am a repeat customer and they always give me a good deal. Just hit Sam up for all your car enhancement needs.< /text>

Took my car over to this place to Get my Windows tinted at noon, got it back at 7:30pm after closing, It was dark outside couldn't really observe the work they did. 2 days later... bubbles on each window, (I did not roll the Windows down). "Short Latino tint guy" was standing 4feet away from my car, telling me he couldn't see the bubbles on all window (back window had a 2inche bubble... hmm... yes. hard to see standing 4feet away... crooked lines on all Windows too. 130 dollars for 50 dollar worth<//Text>

<review>The guy completely wasted my time, after calling in to ask him if they had a specific part he gives me the price of 19 dollars, I said great ill be on my way to get one he said ok ty see you soon. Once i arrived he did not have the part his employee comes out with a different part and says "we can make it work". This is now what i understand they are in habit of doing. I would never get anything installed or will i buy anything from this place. they will sell you anything even if its the wrong part.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I agree with the other reviewer that they should take down their Better Business Bureau placard completely. Horrible service, they talk a good talk but certainly DO NOT follow through. Had a friend suggest this place, they initially quoted us $500 for a back up camera, new head unit, and DVD player. Then I went in there, I'm female and the price went up to $1,000. Yes that's because I wanted a Pioneer head unit and a 13 inch DVD player and he said he was initially quoting the cheapest most basic models of everything.  I quoted this work at a couple different places but went with PCH because they seemed to know what they are doing and because it was referred to me.

When they quoted me they said that they wouldn't move my backseat air condition knobs for the kids, I have a 2005 GMC Yukon and when I went to pick up after 8.5 hours of waiting, after they told me 4-6 hours, then I see that they completely removed the AC unit in the backseat to put the DVD player. On top of that they said that the sound was a little muffled so they ordered a part and it would't be delivered until 4 days later.  I had made it clear that I was moving to Orange county and wanted the complete job handled that day! I had an appointment and got there soon after opening, paid 1,000 to get a DVD player with no sound!!! On top of this literally a HALF HOUR AFTER LEAVING BOTH THE HEAD UNIT AND THE DVD PLAYER WENT COMPLETELY BLANK. THEY WILL NOT TURN ON AND NOW I HAVE NOTHING TO LISTEN TO!

On top of that I ordered this particular module to retain my steer wheel controls, like volume up and down and seeking up and down, they didn't work! I was still being nice and friendly even though I wanted to really give them a piece of my mind, but after the  whole job went out I WAS PISSED! So now they have $1000 of my money in their pockets and I have a radio that doesn't even turn on and a DVD player that won't work! AWESOME! Robert who I've been talking to the entire time said he would throw in 2 wireless head phones for the DVD player, I said no I want 4, because seriously the time, headache, and inconvenience waaay outweighs your $25 headphones!!!!

Do NOT go here! My friend who suggested them, wants to go tell them off because they made him look stupid, and ignorant. He's pissed and they have lost A LOT of future business by the way they handled my truck. Extremely disappointed and wish I would have went with the other bids that were closer to my house. Now I have to drive an hour away just to wait at their stupid shop for over an hour (well that's what they say it'll probably be more like 2-3 hours) while they try and do the job correctly. May I might add I have a 2 month old and a 2 year old running around, so it's not easy and I am extremely frustrated with this place. Robert and his staff talk a good talk but do NOT be swindled by this, they will mess up your car.truck just like they did mine!< /Text>

<Review>i got an Pioneer Radio System Installed, Recently about a month ago. Yesterday I recieved an Amp error when I started my car.. I took it over to them Explaining the problem, then asked if they could take it out and just unconnect it and reconnect it back in, he said no,   then tried to tell me I need an Amp or to replace my speakers in order for the sound to come back on .... I went outside this morning, started my car up, same message, I took it out the non-safe way with Knives , Took out the amp cord and plugged it back in and I got my sound back.... at Least for now... I'm sorry But that was a small request for a stereo that is still under 1 Year warranty , that I've had for about a month now. and PCH Custom Audio WILL NOT BE GETTING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY.<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>First time I called I told them I needed some entertainment for my Car, they were like "coo, bring it in" I got off pretty late from work that day so I asked em can they stay open a lil longer, he said "sounds like your serious, come on down" much respect for that, (stayed open for me 30 min. past closing for me!!! Already earned my respect there)They were excited for the possibility of customizations they could do to my vehicle, actually more than I was 😂, gotta love that enthusiasm. Long story short when the job was done they kept my original touchscreen dash, relocated  and added the custom Pioneer as well 😲😲😲 blew my mind, AMAZING!!! If youre thinking of getting a new system for your ride AND will work with you on a reasonble PRICE??? Make sure you contact them first , TRUST!!!<//review></record>

<Text>Terrible. Bought a TV and dvd combo from these guys. Had it installed and when I came back to pick it up, they installed a completely different brand dvd player than what was originally agreed upon. When I asked them to change it for the brand I paid for they said that the guy who sold it to me no longer worked there. The dvd player never worked properly, wouldn't play any of the listed file types from a flash or usb device so I finally agreed to have them replace it with another "no name brand". After one week the dvd player stopped working completely and just died. They blamed my Honda Odyssey for the malfunction saying it was an electrical short even though I'd just bought my Honda and had no other electrical problems before. NO REFUNDS is their policy and they stick to it. If something goes wrong they try to sell you something more expensive in return or another piece of crap product. I had the dvd player working just long enough for my kids to get use to having one and I spent so much money on this piece of crap equiptment that I can't afford to replace it with something else.< /Text><time>1380069470975<//time><gmap_id>0x80dd315e9d0e1a03:0xd7932d1ff51f75a3</gmap_id><userid>110688602204698457027<//userid><user_name>Michelle Soto</user_name><Rate>1<//Rate>< resp>

< review>
I went in here to get a specific Kenwood radio. They told me they could get it so i put a down payment on it.. Well i ended up finding a similar radio then what i was getting with them for less then half the price. And they wouldn't return my down payment. They lied and said that they had placed the order already and couldn't cancel it. The kendwood ware house was simply a mile from there. And they wanted to charge me a 60 dollar restocking fee. So i ended up getting the radio anyway. So they rip me off and kept the remote that came with the radio. And told me the remote was an extra 35 dollars. So i had to call Kenwood. I asked kenwood if the radio came with the remote and they told me yes. They had to call the shop and make them give me the remote. Kenwood gives you like a year or 2 warrenty and the radio ended up messing up and they lied to me saying that the warrenty was expired only after like a month and that i needed to pay 35 dollars to get it repaired. What a rip off. They lie to you about everything. One of My friends has a sound shop and ended up helping me contact kenwood to get this cleared up with the shop. Never again will i buy anything in this place. This is what happens when your in a hurry to get a new radio that just came out at a different shop then ware you usually buy your things. Don't believe there lies. They will end up over charging you for remotes and everything that actually comes with your radio.< /review>

Hated their customer service, especially when the fat guy that looks like the manger was around. Refuses to help, won't make time for you, and has a rude demeanor. Will never return here for anything.< /Text>

Though it’s not often that something catches my attention to a point where I write about it. From the initial contact to the final process, not at any point did I feel like I was not given the time, service, professionalism, and attention to detail during my experience. The place is amazing, staff is polite and the atmosphere is no less than a high-end resort. From an indoor entertainment area to the outdoor pool, it was nothing but relaxing. Great place to invite and entertain friends and family while feeling like Elon Musk for the day! Go see Gabby today as I am certain that you will not be disappointed. Cheers!

<Text>I have lived here going on three year’s now, this is a beautiful property that has wonderful amenities available to the residents. The units are very nice and updated, with good insulation, and they come with a fire place! The location couldn’t be better with quick access to highway 65, as well as all the restaurants in the area! The neighborhood is quiet in the evening and over nights. Amanda and Gabby that are the leasing agents here, they do a great job and are not only very helpful but are knowledgeable about the area and the market as well.

These apartments come with a garage included ( you don’t pay extra) which is a really nice feature considering not many other complexes offer that! But make sure to use the garage for parking not for storage, which will always help out the open parking situation!</Text>< rate>

As I was searching for a place to live, I narrowed it down to Ascent and two other places.

Gabby made the decision easy with her uplifting attitude and friendly demeanor. She was professional and provided a feeling of security, that this was a nice place to live.

I have not regretted the decision to move into Ascent and it’s always a pleasure to visit the office.< /Review>

I have lived here for almost a year and everything has been wonderful. Everyone in the office is super prompt with responses. Clean, awesome, nice apts!! 100%!! Gabby was my agent who helped me with everything needed to move in. She even checked in with me after I got settled to make sure I had everything I needed/comfortable. I also had some wonderful help with Amanda in the office when I had questions on renewing my lease. Both super friendly, amazing ladies! Thank you!< /review>

<text>First the upside - the staff on site is first class. Willing to listen and help with problems, and take the time to help quickly respond.  Up front Amanda and Gabrielle are excellent in the leasing process.  In the facilities Ed also does a great job, and the maintenance staff is quick to solve issues.  They are honest and patient and work well as a team together.

The negatives to living at Ascent are corporate ownership not finding a solution to the massive parking problem - often you may have to park at an adjacent complex overnight.
Also corporate collects a monthly hefty fee for use of the pool, gym, game room - but it has not been accessible  in close to a year.  Feels like corporate robbery.  Lastly corporate cuts the dump pick-ups in a week resulting in dumpsters almost always overflowing.</text><Name>CRAIG SPENCE<//Name><GmapID>0x809b21ea0d70d5a7:0xdd70f218c90c4fe8< /GmapID><user>105351293731105348815<//user>< Response>

I am very pleased to say how grateful I am to be living at Ascent at the Galleria. I have been living there for quite some time now, and I am happy to say how well the office is managed - - in particular, they are always professional, attentive, passionate and do excellent job at making me feel welcome and  "at home". I'd love to mention Gabby Aamodt, whom I have known the longest, she goes out of her way and is very professional in how she handles situations-- I myself have had to rely on her help on more than 1 occasion; I'd like to mention Cat and Amanda and what a fine job they do to make the team complete. Staff like this makes me never want to leave home ! ! ! Keep up the excellent work! ! !

Stay away from here - I've lived in several places in CA the last few years and this is by far the worst. Maintenance issues everywhere - the latest is the gas is out for the second time in a month. The office rarely answers the phone and messages are left unreturned. I called the emergency line and it just sent me back to the main office that never answers. Totally unacceptable.</review>

<review>I’ve lived here for 3 months now, so far great experience. The office is super nice and responsive. My only complaint is the parking is bad if you have guests over. For myself it works as I only have my car in the garage. The garages are a bit tight to pull into but it is a huge complex. The maintenance is only one guy but they seem to be quickly responsive. Will update as time passes.</review></record></dataset><record>

We lived there for 6 months and they had 3 different managers while we lived there, so that says a lot. Maintenance is such a joke. Literally every single appliance in our apartment broke down at some point while we were there, and sometimes it would take 3+ weeks for them to come in and fix it. It was worth paying thousands of dollars to break our lease and move out of there. Seriously, don't fall for how nice they seem and how nice the show apartments look. None of it is real!</Text></record></dataset><record>

I'm not sure why this complex has any bad reviews. The apartments are just as beautiful as the complex itself, and you couldn't ask for a better location. Quiet and secluded, but also right next to everything you need and them some. And I've dealt with plenty of less-than-helpful leasing agents in the past, but not here. Alex was amazing and couldn't have been more knowledgeable about the complex and the leasing process. Definitely worth checking out.</review>

They are definitely true.  “Luxury” apartments... ha!  It’s all a vernier! Everything is cheap to the max.  The buildings are cheap enough that I can hear my upstairs neighbor snoring at night.  They completely under-built the parking at this place.  Sometimes there will literally be nowhere to park.  If both you and your spouse or  whatever each have a car.  There is no security here, which is something I was straight lied to about ahem sign in if up for the place.  Gate is broken 90% of the time, and I have never even once seen the “security guard” making their rounds.  Don’t let the “amenities lure you in either.  They are all in the lobby, which is not available to you unless you work graveyards.  It is open when people are usually working.  I think we have gotten to use them once.  This complex is MASSIVE with one tiny pool, so it’s hardly usable when you want to swim.  Far too expensive too!  Way too much to pay even if it was as nice as they make it seem.  Seriously.  Look around do not sign a lease here!< /review></record>

Lived here from May 2018-May 2019.
It’s a pretty nice place and close to freeway and stores. The master bedroom closet and bathrooms are large for an apartment. The ceiling is higher than average. Whenever something breaks, the maintenance is amazing and fixes it very quickly. However that being said. If coming home after 7, forget about any parking near your apartment. You will have to park across the complex in the spots next to fences because there will be none otherwise. I literally would not go anywhere after 6 because I have a baby and I didn’t want to carry a car seat that far. The amenities(theater and game room, pool table)are nice but only open from 9-6 Monday through Saturday and if you work a normal 9-5 you will pretty much never use them. On Saturdays, there are way too many people at the pool so rarely used it. One pool for such a massive complex is ridiculous. The gym, jacuzzi, and fireplace area are open longer (I believe til 10?)so I got to enjoy those amenities more often. The tanning bed did NOT work once in the entire time I was there. Gate is broken half the time. I asked about security before moving in and was told yes they have some but never saw them. Smoking is allowed here outside. The management was ridiculous. I received at least 3 false evictions notices each one around 8pm so I couldn’t talk to office until the next morning. I wouldn’t be able to sleep and would have to call in late to work the next morning to figure them out each time because I was keeping up with rent/bills with no other potential issues that would possibly evict me. Apparently the office doesn’t know how to math because they would keep saying we owed them money but every time I talked to a manager and told them to figure it out they said sorry our mistake.(we even ended up having a credit on the last month). We actually bought a house in January and tried to move out but they said in order to move out earlier we would have to pay for an additional 3 months rent. Our rent was 1,880 for a 2bed 2 bath. Thats $5,640 without their “move out” fees. Literally crazy. Barely 6 weeks after we turned in our keys we received a bill stating they have been trying to mail us and because we haven’t paid our move out fees our account had the possibility of going to collections. This was our first notice so of course we sent a check right away. Attached is a picture of their move out fees. I called and asked about the weird charges. Floor level is a charge for living on the first floor. Global fees are the amenities (even though they were already included in our last months rent). My apartment was cleaned professionally but because I couldn’t get a detailed invoice (copy of check doesn’t count) I ended up paying the apartments again for their “cleaning”. Honestly a nice area but the garbage I had to deal with was unacceptable. If your desperate for a nice place to live, come here. If you want peace of mind, go somewhere else.</Review>

**IS ANYONE LISTENING?!** Worst place to live. Management treats you like garbage. They are unresponsive to repair requests, ignore when asking for upgrades (additional garage) and the “luxury amenities” are unavailable during normal living hours. Many tenants either smoke cigarettes or weed on premises. No parking for guests. No added benefits of living here (the Meridians held many free community events). Cops are here often. The neighborhood kids graffiti and steal your personal property.Don’t move in these overpriced “luxury” apartments and get stuck here like we are. **too bad the owners and management team doesn’t read these reviews, you’d think they respond and make changes**<//text>

If I can rate this place negative stars I would. Shame on the management authorities for leading such a place. I’ve lived at the Terraces for over 4 years and I had never faced any problems with the management until Ovi (district manager) took charge 2 years ago. He raises rent every year ($2400 for 3 bedroom), refused taking legal responsibility for changing carpet and painting apartment that’s over 4 years old, locked my car in a garage I parked in temporarily (parking lots congested and continues to overflow), and denied my request for a ground floor apartment (I’m handicap). Merciless, apathetic, and mortifying people and place. Shame!< /Text>

<text>Wow one last jab from this place. Lease was up April 14 I moved out 2 weeks early. Received my finally bill last week for charges, put check in the mail 2 days later and they sent me straight to collections. I have prof of day I sent check and day it came in the mail. On top of them making me an appointment for pre inspections move out, he was 30 min late to this appointment and walked in and said I don’t know what u want me to tell u. We don’t do these ?!!  The whole time they have shown me the up most disrespect and have had me in tears several times. I have spent the last 5 years traveling for a living and living in apartments and have never ever seen anything like what these people will do to u. I even called corporate due to the disrespect and they were just as bad. I ran as soon as my lease was up. I could go on and on with the stories but I don’t have time. I almost forgot to tell my story and then this one last jab came in the mail and reminded me I needed to write my review. So thank u management of terraces at highland reserve for reminding to speak my mind.</text>< pictures>

<text>Hello! My name is Alex, I just recently moved into the Terraces with the help of Casey and Alex. I see that there are some negative reviews that couldn’t be more wrong. They helped us find the right price, and the right location while taking our needs into consideration. We hate the moving process and they couldn’t have made it more easy. I love my free garage and going to the gym 7 days a week is a breeze with access to the gym. You have to see it for yourself! Thank you ladies for helping us move to our favorite apartments. Since I work for Dignity Health I also got another $400 off just for having the job I do which is cheaper than every other complex in the area. I’ve known Alex for years and couldn’t be happier!</text>< pictures>

We pay a hefty price to live where we do. Part of the appeal is the amenities. (gym, pool and hot tub)Not only are these things chained and locked randomly, but I just watched the on site manager unlock the chain so that him and his family could sit in the hot tub. Am I missing something here?</Review>

Rachel the new property manager sends me a new lease at 5:39 pm.  I’m supposed to move in tomorrow and all my utilities are set up on the apartment number on the original lease I signed days ago.
It’s a 12 hour drive and no one will call me back!
If this is an indication of how they treat tenents it’s going to be a long lease!</review>

<Text>Got an eviction notice for OVER paying the rent! You can't make this stuff up. Yes it is true. We had paid and gotten a credit. I can't remember all the details but essentially they wanted a new check for the amount due (since the one they had was for an amount above the rent) rather than issuing a credit and applying it in the future so they sent an eviction notice! I actually had to call and ask if they were seriously going to waste a judge's time and go before a court of law and try to explain themselves. That is how corporate these people are. I lived here about 4 years ago and can't shake the bad memories so I am finally writing a review. This place is SO corporate.... They are inflexible. Had to complain multiple times about a garbage disposal. They needed a more powerful one but instead of replacing it they told me I was using it incorrectly. After lots of unnecessary haggling they did replace it. Walls are paper thin--you can hear everything. Residents don't pick up their dog's waste despite lots of bag dispensers on the property. Management was in the middle of upgrading units and some current residents got upgrades and others didn't. I had a sweet older, disabled man who was a neighbor and I remember he and his wife saying that their unit hadn't been upgraded and the office said they had no plans to do so. Terrible experience.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
Completely disgusted with my experience. If you enjoy being scammed out of $400, get an apartment here. They took my deposit money and tried to con me into spending an extra $400 just to get an application in after we got different orders from my husband's superiors in the air force. Staff is completely fake and not genuine whatsoever. They don't remotely care about getting you a place to live. They want your money and they will do whatever it takes to get it. Don't make the same mistake I did. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, ENERGY, OR MONEY ON THIS PLACE!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!</Review>

We are always striving to offer the best customer experience, especially for customer from out of state like you.

These apartments are not worth what you’re paying for. My garage key works when it wants to. I hope you don’t have a nice car because in the span of a few months my car has been broken into and the windshield has been cracked. They have also over charged us on multiple occasions. Don’t plan on using the grill unless you’re interested in putting a down payment. Oh and don’t expect any type of peace and quiet if you have to wash clothes because the washer and dryer are louder than a jet on take off.< /review>

The actual apartment unit here is pretty amazing. Comes with laundry machines and air conditioning. It’s a pretty big space and cozy. I do however notice that there is poop sometimes on the sidewalk in the apartment. Neighbors need to do a better job picking up after their dogs.</text>

I was in the process of renting an apartment there when I read the reviews and discovered that this company has habitually taken money from potential clients.

This company has yet to return my money, $364 has never been returned to me. I call management and get the run arounds!< /text>< username>

This is the nicest apartment I have ever lived in--and I've moved and been many places in my lifetime.  Conveniently located near the Roseville Galleria mall, lots of shopping nearby, easy access to Hwy 65.  Downstairs apartment has wood floors, except for carpet in each bedroom, granite counter tops, high ceilings, gas fireplace (not for wood).  Nice pool area with lounge chairs for people's use.  Gas grills near the pool need to be reserved in advance. Repair requests are acknowledged quickly and repairs done in a very reasonable period of time--very nice.
Decent mix of people live here, both racially and age-wise.  Like most apartment living, everyone seems to just go about their own business.  Most apartments come with their own garage; some are cheaper and have an outside "Reserved" spot instead.
Management has a somewhat draconian policy towards late payments--no warning phone call, nothing.  I had changed my method of payment on their website, but accidentally had somehow not taken the extra step to activate it (not obvious btw).  A day or two after the payment was late resulted in a 3-day Notice to Quit on my door.  Not friendly. No phone call, no text.  Had to take off of work to get a cashiers check to rectify the situation.
Over-all I like it here and will likely live here a minimum of two years.< /text>

When we renewed our lease they tried to increase rent something like $250/month. We called and argued with them but they refused to budge. We had to call the City of Roseville and the city had to call the apartments to tell them what they were doing is illegal.

Our mailboxes were getting broken into, we let the office know and they didn’t do anything about it. You can see where they pried them open.

The towing company refuses to tow anyone until the parking is repainted. I cant tell you how many times someone parked in our spot and we had to park in the apartment next to ours.

Our car was broken into and everything stolen out of it.

Finally when we moved out they tried to charge us a pg&e fee for early termination. The manager said this was just a pass along fee. We called pg&e and they said they never heard of that and the apartments are BS’ing us, Now the apartment manager wants proof of this. All this on top of the other $700 they’re trying to charge us.

Stay away!!!<//review>< pics>

<Review>The parking is terrible, The maintenance responds to requests about half of the time and the guy who does the repairs is uneducated and incredibly rude, the front office staff is nice but about as useful as using a needle for a paper weight, and to top it off when I moved out I was told I had to have the carpets and the apartment professionally cleaned, so, I did. I cleaned my 3 bedroom 2 bath apartment with the help of my mother for about 3 days almost all day, then paid a professional 240 dollars for 2 people to clean for 20 hours. The place was immaculate 5 times more clean than when we moved in. The complex had the audacity to charge me another 10 hours of cleaning. The carpets came out near perfect after I had them cleaned by a professional yet again they charged me for another carpet cleaning and on the invoice there was nothing checked as to a reason why. There are great amenities here and its close to a lot of things but I promise you it s not worth it in the least.

UPDATE:
going on a week and have not received a call back about my issues the the move out, again failing to meet any set expectation as they did the entire lease, I guess its time to find another avenue of resolution< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x809b21ea0d70d5a7:0xdd70f218c90c4fe8</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

If you prefer peaceful living better to stay away. if you would like fighting this is the best place to go for.

This is my very first google review. I'm a lazy man don't like writing review, but I have to share my very "wonderful" experience in the USA so far,

I'm currently renting an one bedroom suite here paying $1300+ monthly,  I plan to move out by the end of March 2016 but my contract ending Mar 1, I gave them an oval then a formal notice to extend for one month and move out Apr 1, at the time the office staff quoted me for $1748 for March of 2016. I accepted the quote and signed the paper although the price seems to be a bit high. The story just began...

Yesterday Feb 26, 2016, when I came home I saw a notice sticking on the door, with a copy of "Move out pro rate Changes" sheet asked me to pay $3344 for the move out. More amazing was that this copy of paper has my signature on it.

So I went to the office, met the new property manager Mr. Junc and asked him to show me the original signed paper. Guess what, the origin number $1748 on the paper was wiped out, replacing with new number $3344. I asked Mr. Junc to explain, the man refused to revert back and told me he can't understand me as I'm not a business man.

Unwelcome fight just began, guess still a long way to go ...

BTW, the manager just posted another "Parking/Towing Policy Enforcement" which banned parking on the slots which was allowed previously, unless you pay extra $$$$$, Good luck to the current and future tenants.<//text>

<Text>My car was on blocks; wheels and rims stolen. Management was unsympathetic. Their gates were broken that night. Management blamed a tenant for breaking it. Manager didn’t have single ounce of emphathy or understanding. Took them to court but lost the case of course. Now after 1 year of living there they’re raising my rent by $115 for the privledge of staying there. No thanks. If you’re gonna spend approx $1500 for a 1 bedroom go somewhere else.<//Text><gmapID>0x809b21ea0d70d5a7:0xdd70f218c90c4fe8</gmapID><pics>None</pics>< name>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Would not recommend to anyone. It was the worst experience of all living in an apartment complex. The management team was no help ever. Maintenance requests took a long time to be fulfilled, Krista, the lady who worked in the front, was always clueless and had no idea what was going on ever. The apartment was dirty and had many imperfections when we moved in and we returned it better condition and they still charged us for painting, cleaning, and repairs, though we were only there for ten and a half months. When we first moved in, there was a gas leak in our apartment that they didn't even notice. We called and it took them almost two weeks to repair it, and they made us walk to a different unit (which was filthy) the entire time to cook and shower. Overall this was an awful experience, and I would suggest that whoever is reading this chooses somewhere better to live.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809b21ea0d70d5a7:0xdd70f218c90c4fe8</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I’m going to take them to the court special OV.
My lease contract ended in 20Jan18.
So I signed a new one when they send it in “Oct” so I can take the offer.
My wife and I decided to move out the appointment in the beginning of Jan18.
So we thought that we need more time to move out our stuff and we are going to stay as max until the mid of Feb.
So I went to them before my new lease contract starts, asking to cancel it.
OV said yeah sure you can but you are going to pay monthly and your pre notice for leaving the appointment is 30 days, which make sense.

So on Feb1st I payed for the hole month of Feb plus the 10 days left from Jan on the monthly payment rate, plus one extra day cause at the same time I was giving my 30 days notice, OV said it’s not 30 because Feb is 28 days so you have to pay for the 1st of March.

That’s how they treat me after 2 years been there.
Any way thats not the point.
So I still have the check of that payment it was huge.

THEY DID NOT CANCEL THE LEASE CONTRACT THAT I SIGNED IN OCT17 WHEN I ASKED THEM TO DO SO IN THE 17-18th of JAN 2018.
NOW THEY GAVE MY FILE TO A COMPANY THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME TOW MONTH PAYMENT.
SAYING I LEFT WITHOUT 60 DAYS NOTICE.

I’m taking this to the court cause if that’s what you wanna charge for why did you take the monthly payment on Feb18????!!</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x809b21ea0d70d5a7:0xdd70f218c90c4fe8</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

We made an appointment for a tour and were told all about these great specials etc. so we head over there immediately after the phone call and wait in the lobby.  There were two rude ladies working who brushed us off and told us to wait, one was on the phone the other was doing nothing.  So we wait, meanwhile a gentleman walks in and sits down waiting next to us, 5 minutes later the manager comes and greets him and asks how she can help, looking at us and not even considering the fact we had been waiting.  There was another lady inside waiting who looked just as upset as we were, so we walked straight out.  When we got to the door a lady comes chasing saying to just wait one more minute, we told her that was not going to happen as they both ignored our entire family.

We were going to sign papers and were ready to move now, I hope others read this and avoid this place completely as those two working in the office are incompetent and would never attend to their tenants.

Very rude ladies, not even a smile when we walked in.  Crazy that they think this is acceptable.< /Text>

OV said yeah sure you can but you are going to pay monthly and your pre notice for leaving the appointment is 30 days, which make sense.

So on Feb1st I payed for the hole month of Feb plus the 10 days left from Jan on the monthly payment rate, plus one extra day cause at the same time I was giving my 30 days notice, OV said it’s not 30 because Feb is 28 days so you have to pay for the 1st of March.

That’s how they treat me after 2 years been there.
Any way thats not the point.
So I still have the check of that payment it was huge.

THEY DID NOT CANCEL THE LEASE CONTRACT THAT I SIGNED IN OCT17 WHEN I ASKED THEM TO DO SO IN THE 17-18th of JAN 2018.
NOW THEY GAVE MY FILE TO A COMPANY THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME TOW MONTH PAYMENT.
SAYING I LEFT WITHOUT 60 DAYS NOTICE.

I’m taking this to the court cause if that’s what you wanna charge for why did you take the monthly payment on Feb18????!!< /review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>Currently living there and have had my place broken into twice. My rims were just stolen last Friday on my brand new car, along with another renter had all four tires stole as well. Maintenance said it's happened before. Put up on blocks tires taken. Neglagents on complex part and JRK who runs it asked them to invest in security, cameras to no prevale! We have cockroaches and ants, we are paying almost 1800 for luxry living but its not! We asked to break our lease three months early due to it affecting my wife's health and I work out of town and she doesnt feel safe. Wholes in the fence no security at all. We put in our own security cams due to the complex refusal to or hiring security. The manager does walks and calls that security. We've had mail stolen from our from door, our new 74 thousand ford explorer sport keyed 2900 worth of damages and someone backing into our other vehicle. There's been four other break ins and they don't care. DO NOt MOVE IN WORSE PLACE TO LIVE. They make you feel awful and turn it on you. My rims wouldn't have been stolen if they'd fixed there gate broken for three days. Caller Corporate and no response on if they'll allow us to break our lease three months early, have left messages every day no response at all. They're awful.

The issues with JRK Management and The Terraces at Highland Reserve are endless! We have had ongoing issues with the upstairs neighbors, and complaints to management have gone unnoticed and unresolved. We believe, due to these issues, we have now been targeted by management and have begun to receive parking violation notices on our vehicles, while vehicles committing the same violations one spot over, have no notices.

Issue #1
On the morning of Friday January 20th we awoke to a parking violation notice on our Ford Taurus, which was parked in a visitor spot. The violation was due to a red sticker car being in a visitor spot, however, pictures I took on that same morning show a number of resident vehicles, with red stickers, being parked in visitor spots, with no notices of violation. Now, it's no secret that the parking at the Terraces is deplorable, which is why vehicles end up parking in these visitor spots overnight. Furthermore, we find this violation notice to be a blatant, targeted, attack against us, and only one in a long line of issues with this place.

Issue #2
On the morning of Sunday January 29th, we again awoke to a violation notice, this time on our Ford Focus, this one for a blue sticker car being parked outside the garage. In the 5 months we've lived here, my blue sticker car has been parked outside more than a handful of times, overnight, with zero attention. This also is being received as a targeted attack against us, as there were no other notices on any other blue or red stickered cars that morning which were parked incorrectly, and there were many other potential violations, as usual.

Issue #3
This morning, as I left for work, I noticed a number of violations, again, with no notices at all. A blue truck, which has been playing musical parking spots, bouncing from visitor spot to visitor spot for months, has yet to receive a violation, and it has no sticker of any kind. I believe there is a stipulation in the lease dictating how long a visitor can stay consecutively, so if this is in face a visitor, it would constitute a violation. If it's a tenant, also it would constitute a violation, surely more of a violation than either of my cars being parked for one night. In addition, the on-site property manager's Nissan Cube was photographed parked in a visitor spot. As we've already discussed with management about the pool being locked during regular use hours, it is vehemently unacceptable for on-site staff to be given special privileges, while the paying tenants are not. Finally, another car was seen this morning, next to mine, to have a red sticker, in a visitor spot, with no notice. All of these vehicles had enough condensation on the windows to deduce, with reasonable certainty, that they had been parked overnight, and should have received notices.

Issue #4
The upstairs neighbors continue to be an outstanding issue. Our calls to the after hours line went unresolved. The neighbors continue to wake us up before 5:30 every morning, stay up with loud banging noises on all walls and floor well past 10:00pm every night. It has also become common for us to be woken up in the middle of the night, as late as midnight and 2am in many cases, to loud noises against the wall, sounds of a dog running back and forth through the house, and loud voices and yelling. Still, these issues are unresolved, yet we had the courtesy officer dispatched to our apartment the other night with claims we had played loud music after 10pm. He informed us the call came in at 10pm on the dot. He entered my apartment, and I let him listen to the volume of our TV, which had not changed for over 2 hours, and the time of his visit was 10:30pm. So now we have provable evidence of false accusations, made by the neighbors, regarding our actions, yet we have no resolution to their issues.

I strongly advise anyone considering The Terraces at Highland Reserve, or any other JRK management property, to look elsewhere. The lack of care and service received by management is unbelievably horrible, by far the worst I've dealt with in my life.< /text>

I would NOT recommend this complex to anyone. For starters, almost everyone on the officr staff is rude. They will be very brief with you as if it is a pain for them to have to speak with you. Also, the apartment that we moved into had several problems. When we first moved in during the summer, the a.c. unit was not functioning properly. We called maintenance to request someone to fix it, and it took them several days to come to our apartment. The maintenance man told us that it was a switch that was not turned on. This is something that should have been addressed prior to move in, especially considering the fact that we moved in during the summer. Another problem we encountered at move in was a gas leak. No one on the staff caught this prior to us moving in, and that should be a red flag to whoever is reading this. A gas leak can be a very dangerous situation, and it seems that the staff must not realize this, because it took them several weeks to repair it. During that time, we had to cook and shower in an dirty apartment a couple buildings away. Once winter came around, the heater was not working. After putting in a maintenance request, we again waited many days for them to fix it. They did not show up on the day they said they would, and when they finally did the next day, it turned out to be that they had turned off the heater for the summer and failed to inform us.  On top of this was a plumbing problem with our apartment that took them another few days to get to. When we gave our 60-day notice, they tried to get us to turn in our keys 6 days early and yet still charge us the $500 in rent associated with those 6 days. My roommate discussed this with one of the women in the office, and the woman was rudely saying we had to turn in the keys early and still pay the extra money. Finally, another women from the office came out and said that the other woman was wrong, and that we could keep the keys for those 6 days. The way that the office staff treats its residents (who pay an exorbitant amount of money to live in this awful place) is appauling. I don't know how any of them have a job dealing with people. The last thing they did was to charge us extra money upon move out. My roommates and I kept the apartment in extremely good conditon throughout the entire time we lived there. On top of this, we spent an additional 15 hours cleaning the apartment one final time. We left the apartment in better condition than it was when we received it. During our time there, one of the maintenance workers even told me that our apartment was one of the cleanest he had seen in his time there. Yet they still took our entire deposit and charged us an additional amount of money for cleaning. Therefore, DO NOT MOVE INTO THESE APARTMENTS. You will get ripped off, treated with disrespect by the office staff, deal with several repairs needed in your apartment, and it will take forever to get anything fixed, even if it is high priority. I would suggest going somewhere else to rent.</Text>

WORST RENTAL EXPERIENCE EVER! DO NOT RENT HERE!

FIRST OFF....When first visiting this community you will be welcomed by a sweet blonde lady named KRISTA (leasing consultant) do not be fooled she is a total Queen B down the road and completely unprofessional and high school immature. She will have an attitude when speaking to you and roll her eyes or huff and puff under her breath when she disagrees with you. Honestly, she should have been fired a long time ago for behavior and body language towards residents. I DID NOT PAY $1702 a month just in rent....not including their Utility Bill to be treated as such. I AM A FORMER PROPERTY MANAGER AND WOULD NEVER LET MY STAFF ACT IN THIS MANOR.
When I first applied at this community my husband has just deployed and the office staff would not accept his documents of deployment or MILITARY PAY! I had to have someone call from his unit to verify his deployment status when they had the documents right in front of them! After, that!.....we got hit with a $1702 security deposit because they believed if we really said the money we made was true we could afford the move in cost of $3500.00...Well after arguing with OVI the manager and KRISTA (leasing consultant We ended up paying the $3500 to move in.....only to find out the tenants before us smoked in the apartment and we did not get a full paint job in the unit but only new carpet and new appliances. I even took pictures of evidence the people smoked and they said sorry we can not disclose if they were smokers but....ovi can walk the unit and "SMELL" for smoke.....ovi said he didn't smell anything but there were clear signs of cigerate smoke damaged and we still complained. finally, they put an OZONE machine in the unit to clear the air. The unit still smelt like smoke for a very very long time and the best part was.....was finding multiple cigerate buds and rolled buds in the "new"carpet that were stuck between the carpet and base boards. I couldn't even open and close my apartment windows easily and was told oh well you will have to deal with it. Our dishwasher also flooded 2 times do to them not installing it correctly. Also the heater would not work because they had the valve shut off and never turned it on after we moved in (how the hell are your residence suppose to know there is a valve when its something your maintenance staff is suppose to do prior to move in )

Say the least we were not happy..

We had neighbors that fought and had domestic disputes. had to call the police more than once.

we also had one of our cars tagged and towed off all the way to loomis even though it was tagged and visible. I was even able to pull the permit out of my car window at the tow yard but still got stuck paying $300. I was then told by the tow company to ask for a rent back from the property since it was their faught well.......OVI said its not his fault i have a car with black tinted windows......but their proof for a tow was to take a photo 10 ft from my car rather then look at the sticker on my dash board. So....I NEVER GOT MY $300 back.

AT MOVE OUT!
omg....at this point you don't exist. they do not care about u any more and they want you to do nothing so they can get any and all of your deposit. WELL, it was pulling teeth with KRISTA AND OVI. KRISTA AT THIS POINT HAS THE BIGGEST ATTITUDE IN THE WORLD. It's like come on seriously we all want to move on with our lives don't be a B**** just because i put my 60 day notice in and kindly asking you for a cleaning checklist so I can clean my apartment. BUT KRISTA SAID DON'T CLEAN AT ALL you WILL NOT GET YOUR DEPOSIT BACK ANY WAYS. Well.....she basically was right....we should have received a check for $1200+ 21 days after we moved out on March 14, 2017 and still have not received out deposit check and today is April 21, 2017.....we have contacted the office and KRISTA DOES NOT EVEN TELL THEM WE CALL FOR AN UPDATE. OVI doesnt even call back with an update unless we threaten to call corporate and state we are documenting his staff and the dissatisfaction we have experienced.<//review>

Kids didn't like this park at all, the playground was not suitable for their ages(3 and 4 y) hence we only stayed for 15 minutes then left. Apart from that its a nice place.< /text>

No bathrooms at this park...that doesn't make sense to me at all, with tables and bar b q grills to host a party. Beautiful scenery though.</Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>I rarely hand out compliments especially when it comes to public reviews however I feel it's necessary to express my appreciation to the worker that helped my daughter and I at this location today. (I will edit this once I figure out what her name is) it was her willingness to not only go above and beyond but compassionately and efficiently identify when a customer is needing to sit or take a moment. (Chronic and severe neck pain recipient here) I just felt the need to drop by here and say thank you. You definitely have excellent customer service down. you pay attention to the people and even without words you can identify and handle with care and concern . That never happens so truly thank you.</text><Rate>5< /Rate><user_name>dawn forrespect</user_name></record>

This place is horrible, I called before going to purchase an IPhone and was told they had a new IPHONE6 for $199.00 I was purchasing for my 13 year old son who I allowed to go in and buy the phone they took $300 from him and gave him a used phone and it was just before closing time we got the phone home only to realize it was used and broken the phone does not hold a charge for more than 5 minutes they gave him a knock off charger also. I went straight there after work the following day and theu was closed at 7:00 pm even though there store hours say open until 8:00pm. I am in disbelief thay a person could be such a monster to take advantage of a child, I normally would not allow my son to make such a big purchase without going in, however one would not expect a retailer to be so crooked. Lying thieves. Horrible people stealing from children. Whay cowards you are to take advantage of a kid
And close early tje next day. CROOKS< /Text>

<review>My old phone didn't work right so I upgraded to a new phone and better plan.  Used smartswitch app to move stuff into new phone.  Seems like it worked and nothing lost.  Got a case and screensaver too.  Whole process of purchase, setup, was 30 minutes or less.  I like the new phone.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The only Boost store I'll go to😁
The young lady their is so friendly and informative (forgive me I'm bad with names)
I even sent my son to her when another boost store messed his phone account up. She couldn't fix the problem on her end, but she was however able to explain what happened to the other boost store to explain how they could correct the error. Now that's customer service.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Boost has nice phones, the agent was helpful but their service is awful. I don't get much coverage. Also Sprint owns boost if I would have known that, wouldn't have ever went there.<//text>

the website said they were open till 7:30. We got there asst 7:05 and they were closing.  We went back the next day and they didn't even have the phone they said we could get.  We went to the boost on Cirby in Roseville and they gave us a much better deal on an upgraded phone<//Text>

<text>My experience was AMAZING! Natalie helped me with all of the financing and I couldn’t be more happy with my purchase of new 2021 Jeep Cherokee Latitude!! The process was fast, easy and super friendly. I told Natalie what I was working with and she made it happen for me. Thank you SO much.

Norma n Jimmy my sales team worked very very hard to get me outta my previous loan and negative equity, to get me into the truck I've always wanted n needed.

We were very disappointed with our experience. We found a vehicle we liked, and went in to discuss finances. We were shown a piece of paper with the price of the vehicle that we were happy with, and agreed to proceed with financing and a credit check. We negotiated the finance rate and once we were happy with the rate, we were given a "final price." The "final price" had a sale price for the vehicle that was $5000 more than the original price they quoted (the "new" price was the sticker price).  When we pointed this out they first told us that we were incorrect, and when we asked to see the original paper they said "it was a mistake" and there was "nothing they could do." The manager offered to take $500 off the sticker price, as the "best they could do." The price difference, while substantial, was less concerning than their incompetence, apparent lies, and unethical business practices.</text>

I knew exactly what I wanted and tried to work with several dealerships in the Sacramento area.  Each time I would get the deal all worked out, the dealership would try to make some last minute change.  I got the run around for over two weeks.  I called Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram and spoke with Terry Livings (Sales Manager).  I explained exactly what I wanted.  He said he would call me back in two hours and when he did he had located exactly the truck I was looking for and the deal he put together was BETTER than the best deal I had been offered at the other dealers.  This was on a Wednesday, I came in on Saturday and he the truck ready to go.  Another sales manager Marty helped us do some of the final paperwork and the finance dept. was a breeze.  My wife and I purchase cars often and have high expectations of the dealership.  These folks are the best we have worked with in many years.  It’s worth the extra drive to Lodi.  I highly recommend!</review>< Pictures>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>I would give no stars if possible. This dealers service manager Joe admitted they did not diagnose vehicle by the Chrysler factory repair manual. I feel that is the purpose of the dealer otherwise you can go to any shop. Good luck anybody going in for service at this dealer.
If the owner Leonard Harrington of this dealer really cares about customer service I hope they reach out to me. I have also filed a complaint with Chrysler regarding this dealers service center.< /Text>< pics>

This dealership sold me a truck with aftermarket alterations that caused catastrophic damage to the axle on my $50,000 heavy duty truck.  They do not return my calls, respond to emails, certified letters, or even the Bureau of Automotive Repair!  But they certainly respond to all of the positive reviews left for them.  As soon as there is a problem they scurry and hide.  The last I heard from Hope, the service manager, she was supposed to call me back on October 28.  Still no call.  I did receive a call from Shannon Reilly, the sales manager, that they would fix the axle at their dealership only.  He said he would send me details of the repair offer by mail.  January 2021, still not a call, letter, or even an apology that their repair shop toasted a $10,000 axle.  Shannon, I’ve left you 4 messages, where is my offer to repair that was ‘in the mail’?

I look forward to my day in court. I will also publicly post the judges/arbitration orders on this review.</Text>

Ram 2500 cummins

One star says it all....no need to make it long.

Agreed price thru text was $59,411 OTD. Drove 2.5 hours with my family and wasted another 2 hours at the dealership, incorrect price.

Was ready to take the truck for $59,411 even with the dent on the pass side door and the 2 paint chips on the Dvr door....glad things didnt work out.....would have driven me crazy on a black truck.</Review>

<Review>Offered us 6,000 less for our trade in than anyone else. Waited for a very long time to find that out. I had already talked to the salesman about the trade in. He must have not actually looked it up until we drove 1-1/2 hours to get there.</Review>< pics>

<Review>I had a great experience buying a new Jeep Cherokee at Lodi Jeep. Andy, the sales representative, made the purchase process extremely smooth. He showed me multiple options within my budget, he presented me the pros and cons of each vehicle, and ultimately he helped me deciding among the multiple options without being pushy. I would definitely recommend my experience with Andy and Lodi CDJR.  I also had a great experience with their service department. Rick and team were extremely knowledgeable and helpful.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

It’s interesting how all the reviews are either 1 star or 5 stars.  I also find it interesting how many people have had good experiences at this dealership when many many more have not.  As soon as a 1 star review shows up, they counteract it with 5 star reviews.  It’s pretty simple to look at the dates of the reviews and how they correspond.  They always say that the negative reviews are the ones that people write, so what is incentivizing the 5 star reviews??  Hmmmm, maybe it’s a free car wash.  Whatever it is, it’s certainly not an accurate depiction of what is going on at Lodi CDJR. One review here states a customer literally witnessed the acknowledgment of a bait and switch between manager and salesman.  WHAT?!  How is this company still in business?!< /Review>

Worst place to purchase a vehicle they sold me a vehicle back in august that was involved in a accident don’t know how they got the car fax to come back as no accidents but there is clear evidence that the car was damaged before. I took car to a body shop to get detailed and they pointed out to me that the vehicle had been damaged before so bad that the paint don’t even match. Never payed attention to it at the angle the shop showed me, also when I was doing contract they never disclosed that they were charging me for security system that I never asked for in the first place until I was signing I saw a charge asked them what it was for they said we install this system in the cars so we have to charge you for it. It’s a good tracking system don’t get me wrong but they never told me about hoping I didn’t pay attention. Then yesterday when I called them to disclose what I had discovered there answer was that’s what you get for buying a used car. I guess in a way there right but just want to make people aware of my situation please people do business elsewhere. They are terrible god bless</Text>

They wanted to charge me multiple service hours for a simple item repair  that was left incomplete (GPS reset & re-calibration).

I want to love this Dealership, but unfortunately have been left with a bad taste in my mouth.  I sold a Jeep back to them recently and the overall experience was great.  They gave me a fair price and made it easy.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the service department. When I picked up my car I had to pay for a repair that was never completed. On the way home my wife was not only able to diagnose the problem, but also able to fix it in a matter of minutes. No extra computer skills or equipment necessary. I struggled with the service department to get a refund and instead was told it was my fault and I needed to pay for the technician's time. "Fighting for the customer" was never a concern. I was told it was a potential warranty repair, but then was not given any break in diagnostic price because nothing was "broken." In regard to warranty repair I was simply left hanging with a bill. Tim's customer service skills are horrendous.  Hope, (the service manager), was pleasant after the fact and only charged me for 1/2 hr. diagnostic, but too little too late. I was still charged for something they never fixed (and we fixed before we even got home- insert eye-roll here.)</review>

We had went to the dealer in Newark and they seemed like they either didn’t know what they were doing or just didn’t care.They ran my credit and left empty handed bc they couldn’t find me a deal, I had to put $8,000 down in order to trade my car I was loosing hope after that. But  After calling around and my husband found this dealer in Lodi and just by talking to them on the phone I really felt like that were really trying to help and that they care. Long story short we drove from Fremont to Lodi after they had told us they were able to do the trade on our truck. We walked out that dealer ship with our brand new 2021 truck with a low rate! Of 4.6 ! I went from 11 or 12% to 4.6! Like wow! If I could give Chuck and Steve more than five stars I would give them 100! I’m sooo happy and so thankful for them! Thanks again guys for doing the impossible for us!</text>

Worst service department I've seen in a long time. Called twice on a Thursday to make an appointment, Ring/No answer. Called the following Saturday morning to make an appointment, transferred to service dept.three times, Ring/No answer. Drove to dealership. Waited for service, no acknowledgement of my presence by two service techs. Sign said open on Saturday to better serve you, by appointment only. You can't make an appointment because nobody is answering the phone. From now on...Lasher Elk Grove, will be where I go.</review>

Asked him if he could give a price on a truck. He pulled out his phone and gave us a quick price. Friendly guy! Hope he wasn't headed to lunch. We really appreciated him taking the time. Were shopping for a truck but not ready at the moment, but I know where I'd like to check first!< /text>< Pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Steven was utterly rude. Our interaction ended with him telling me “you don’t have the money for it anyway”. Who says that! Have a little respect for your potential clients! Was looking at a truck but the monthly came out to be too much. Went to my plan b and was looking at a trade-in fiesta that they had on the lot. The KBB trade-in value for it is $4k but they had it listed for $9k, a $5k markup than what they gave the guy for as his trade-in. They tried forcing a $1,100 gps on me as well. Such a joke. Remember, this is a business. They make not one, not two, but many thousands from each vehicle they sell. Do yourself a favor and don’t get scammed, find a good private party deal and get an auto loan from your local credit union. Dealerships like this are major rip-offs!<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

My first time going to Lodi CDJR to look to buy been there just looking around but i went on 1/29/21 to actaully purchase I meet Michael C which is a great help. He helped me find my jeep (anyones price range) and i absolutely love my jeep. It was a very great experience for me and my family so if you are looking for a newer car,truck,van, suv please stop by your local Lodi CDJR dealership and ask for Michael C. The staff is very friendly and they are not pushy and that is one thing i dont like is pushy people. Wondeful dealership located on Beckman Road in Lodi go check them out you wont be sorry. Thanks to everyone at Lodi CDJR</Review>

The staff  is exceptionally professional and friendly and will do whatever it takes to get you the car or truck you desire within your price range and budget.

Showroom and lot is very clean, and LCDJR has an excellent selection of vehicles to choose from.

Highly recommended.< /review>

<text>They bait and switched me.  When I spoke to the manager Shannon about it, he said that they would never do that.  That it’s illegal.  After using the restroom I literally walked right into him telling his salesman to be more careful and that next time it could be a serious problem if the public were to catch on.  Wow.< /text>< Pics>

Feb, 15, 2020 we were looking to purchase a Ram truck. We 1st stopped at a different location and were treated so badly we left.
Then we went Lodi CDJR. Met Chuck, what a pleasant breath of fresh air. Accommodating is an understatement.  We left with our Ram and have never been happier with a car buying experience. We highly recommend this  dealership,  and you won't find a better more attentive salesman than Chuck.</review>

<Text>The salesman was nice but didnt seem to really "listen" to what we were looking for. When we finally got them to hear what it was we wanted we were then given over to their "internet specialist".  Not wanting to waste anyone's time, we asked if they had that vehicle with the options we wanted in their stock and the "internet specialist" said without skipping a beat "No we don't- goodbye."  We immediately turned and left. He was rude, disrespectful and arrogant. We will NOT be stopping there ever again.</Text>< Pics>

I’ve bought numerous cars before and I have never had an experience like this where the sales person was so disrespectful and pushy. My girlfriend and I saw a car that we liked online so decided to go check it out. We called because we had a question before stopping by and STEVE M. answered so we told him we were on our way. We went for a test drive and loved the car so we decided to sit down and work out a deal. Steve disclosed that he was going to present numbers first and then if we liked what they could offer he would run credit. After reviewing we told him the numbers wouldn’t work with out budget and he kept asking us what we didn’t like. I would try to explain and he kept cutting us off and talking over us saying we weren’t being reasonable and how great of a deal it was. He started to get argumentative and defensive and began getting louder and louder as if he was trying to intimidate us into buying a car even if we weren’t comfortable with the terms of the financing. I don’t know if he was talking to us in that manner because we were women or if that’s just the way he does business. He finally took no for an answer and said he would go grab our keys from the trade in. HE THEN COMES BACK WITHOUT OUR KEYS AND TELLS US THAT HE RAN CREDIT WHEN WE CLEARLY TOLD HIM WE WEREN’T INTERESTED. We now have to deal with sending disputes in to the credit bureaus because credit was checked without consent. DO NOT VISIT THIS DEALERSHIP.</text>

Because of Covid I called in and made an appointment. When I got there I had a salesman tell me they were too busy and come back. That got me a little upset made a phone call to the manager and then spoke to the salesman and ended up going back. I had a truck I wanted to buy and was qualified, I had more money down that I was willing to tell them to make my payments were I wanted them, we were trying to work a deal. It got tough for Alex the salesmen and another customer came in that he had appointment as well and he left me to go to him....not very good business. I’ve bought three cars from them I will never buy another. I also find it funny that the owner only comments on the 5 star reviews. There many issues you should deal with in your facility.< /text>

I bought my Redeye widebody challenger here..when the day came to come in and sign papers, they had entirely different numbers than what I expected.  The salesman kept trying to talk over me and say I was wrong and distract me..I refused to allow that to happen..After much back and forth and refusing to accept what I was being told, come to find out there was $73 extra in taxes they say was an error, there was $895 added for an alarm app that I stated multiple times I did not want, nor did I ever request it.It was simply added to my papers..Finally after arguing about not wanting the alarm app, I went into finance to sign the papers..Believe it or not his numbers once again didnt match up..Upon looking, they STILL HAD THE $895 in my documents, trying to sneak it by.

Upon arriving home I noticed a small ding or dent that happened during shipping or at the dealership..I immediately contacted them and sent them pics..I was told they had a dent guy that would take care of it.  I was later contacted stating if I wanted to pay for it, the dent guy could come to my house and fix it..(a dent I didnt even cause)  I attempted to contact the dent guy twice and have not heard back.

The shipping guard was supposed to be removed prior to my arrival to pick up the car. It of course wasnt..I had to return the next day to have it done. Upon return of my car from the shop, I noticed a ding in one of my brand new wheels.  I made them aware of this and was once again given the number of a wheel guy..That once again I could pay for..for a wheel they damaged.  He returned my call and the dealership stated that if I take my car to them when the wheel guy is there the dealership MAY help me..

And finally here appeared to be an issue with all 4 of the brand new tires on the car...what appeared to be a defect..when I inquired I was told I was on my own and the dealership had nothing to do with it...I contacted Dodge Customer Care who contacted the dealer and called me back and said they were rude as hell to her (one of their own) and even yelled at her...She recommended that I find another dealership to deal with that this dealership wasnt very good.

So I texted the dealership today to coordinate the wheel and dent guy to see if this dealership was going to do ANYTHING to assist with damage to my wheel they caused, dent to my car caused by others, or address the tire issue. I HAVENT HEARD ANYTHING BACK..what a shock...

So I took it to Les Schwab and resolved the tires...Im stuck with the dent and scraped wheel that they did, and also a chip in the front bumper that was repaired by them and lasted all of 24 hrs before returning...

So shotty repair on the one item they did fix, avoidance of responsibility on the dent and even on damage they themselves caused...All the while trying to take me for over $1000 extra dollars for stuff I didnt request and even DECLINED 3 times...only to try and sneak the papers by and get signed...NOT THE PLACE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS!</Text>

<Review>I test drove a couple of cars here last week I enjoyed the experience about what made me a little uncomfortable is that covid-19 is going around and when you test drive somebody is in the car with you. I test drove at other places in the same week and they let me drive the car by myself. When someone is in a car with you you have the pressure of buying the vehicle but especially during this covid it puts the salesperson and the customer at risk.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< date>

I have a lot of experience in car buying and I still feel like I got screwed over and manipulated. I was rushed and pressured into making a decision and was told repeatedly that if I don’t hurry up and sign the papers, they would be “pissed” at me. The finance manager, Michael, did not explain anything to me that I was signing and the sales manager, Marty, quoted me completely different from what I actually ended up paying. The customer service overall is terrible at this location. Take your money somewhere else.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<review>If I could give this place a negative review, I would. They’re really rude and not helpful at all. The Sales Manager Steve Magana needs a lesson on customer interaction and not be rude to customers. Saying stuff like “are you going to buy a car or are you going to waste my time” is not the way to sell a vehicle. This person also lied on the listing and discount offered and got rude when we presented a flyer to him. I would recommend to go elsewhere.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Name>Life of Rice and Beans< /Name><response>None< /response>< Rate>

I had to sue them to repair my truck that their service department damaged.  Close to $10,000 in repairs!  And they didn’t even provide me with a car rental.  Go ahead.  Buy from them!< /review>

Okay the only reason I’m giving a five star review is because our sales person Megan. My daughter came in and bought a dodge journey. She worked so hard to get her into a car. My daughter had some credit problems.  not once did she make us feel bad. Unlike other dealers. Megan was so compassionate, Megan said the only promise I can make is that I will work my butt of for you. And boy she did. She even bought us and my grandkids food.  Now as for the store. it’s a mess...The place is so dirty! The guy that did our paperwork was so rude! Like as if we were a bother to him. I really hated the store. The only reason we bought was because of Megan!<//Review>

I went to the Lodi dealer as I received a recall notice. And decided to get the oil changed also on my 2013 Chrysler 300. When the car was finished I noticed the easy exit seat was not working properly. I brought it to the attention of the service guy Tom. He said since I didn't have memory seat buttons on the driver's door that it was impossible for the easy exit seat to operate. I explained to Tom that the easy exit seat was working and has been since I bought the car in 2014or 15. He said he was too busy with other customers to help me and that I should call the Chrysler dealer. , I told him that I would. In the meantime I got on YouTube. And find the video that fixes the easy exit seat. And to do that you turn your car on put the seat all the way back, then put the seat all the way forward put the seat all the way back put the seat all the way forward and then put it all the way back again. Turn off your car. Then turn it back on. And the seat went right back to where it was supposed to be and the telescoping Steering wheel also return to where it should be. So, thanks to the YouTube video. I was able to fix the problem that Tom ignore me about. That's why I only the two stars. And I want to say that this is not a reflection on the rest of the staff. All I know is if my wife is happy that I was able to fix the seat.<//review>

Had my daughter turn her keep in for an oil service at around 11. After being told that the Shuttle bus was out & would be back to pick her up she waited for about 90 minutes before calling me to come pick her up. After her car was completed they called her to let her know the store was closing in an hour & the shuttle driver went home for the day. This is not the first time this has happened to her & believe the customer service needs to up their ante on providing more support to their customers when they need to get back home & not stay there for the next 6 hours. We will be taking our services elsewhere & not recommending this place again.< /Review>

After countless hours of research and searching for a vehicle that fits my needs, I came into this dealership after a few other dealership that didn't know their product. Ron, the product specialist, helped me out by explaining the features and was very knowledgeable about the 2015 Dodge Challenger. The car I was looking for. I recommend anyone that needs information or wants excellent service to contact Ron at this dealership. You wont regret the visit.< /Review>

Had gone in September they ran our credit and couldn’t get us a good deal on a truck with our decent credit. Got a call from an “upgrade” manager decided to go back to see if they offered a better deal. Tried to make it seem like we didn’t know what we were dealing with and Specifically said NOT TO RE RUN OUR CREDIT, what did they do they RE RAN either way after we said not too! We’re offered a payment like a house payment which first time was cheaper so waste of time. Make sure if you go with them that you have enough knowledge so that they don’t make you feel like time was wasted and don’t let them re run your credit unless you give consent! NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!<//text>

I wish you could do no stars.......
Pulled into the service area for an oil change. Sat there waiting at my car for 20 minutes. Not a single employee acknowledged me at any time. Walked inside to the cashier's desk to ask how do I get service. She instructed me to stand out in the bay next to my car and somebody would come to help me. Wasted another 10 minutes standing there. Not a single employee that walked by me acknowledged me or asked if I needed help.
Not the place I will ever go again.
Shame on you Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep!

<username>Jay G</username><Time>1590182534195<//Time><user>100475982824832302800<//user><review>Im still in disbelief this occurred. I went in Sunday May 17th to inquire on a 2013 Ram 2500 that was being advertised for $30,400.00 under 100k mikes great deal. Spoke to the Internet manager through out the deal. I looked at the truck it “wasn’t” ready which it was dirty which was no big deal. We went to his desk to talk business and work a deal. After a few minutes I was told the that the truck price had been adjusted to $37,500 I said ok no problem.

We worked a deal and got approval from a credit union everything was good to go term of the loan etc. Since the truck wasn’t ready to go I signed the document showing the loan info etc. I went home cleaned up the trade-in got it ready to go. On Monday the internet sales manager calls me and said they had issues with the truck and was deemed unsafe so had to be sent to auction. The truck remained on car gurus and Lodi cdjr’s website only this time for $38,231.

I went down to Lodi cdjr on Monday May 18th to try and figure what’s going on and I asked to speak to one of the finance managers well they wouldn’t give me the time of day. The internet manager well at-least he talked to me, but either way to pull out of a deal.

I called Lodi Cdjr this morning May 22nd and was told the truck had been sold yesterday May 21st...< /review><Rate>1</Rate>< gmap_id>

Went to their website and found a nice truck I wanted. It had a the MSRP and then the dealers price. I emailed them and immediately got a call from Mrs. McQueen. She stated that they have two prices and that. The one on the site and a "E" price. Said she could give me the "E" price if I came down. Drove an hour to get there only to be told that there is no other price. They would not budge. I don't like being lied to or mislead. Sales manager was pretty disrespectful in his demeanor. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.< /Review>

My experience with Chrysler was a great one. The salesman who helped me was Charlie. He was very knowledgeable and did everything he could to help me and was also very understanding. I genuinely felt he had my best interest at heart while searching for a vehicle and wasn’t just pushing me to buy one like salesmen normally do. I think he deserves some type of incentive or raise. It was because of him that I felt comfortable buying my car even at the monthly payments I got it for. Thank you again for everything.</review>

The Service Dept. could use a makeover.  There  is no Receptionist to greet you so you have to basically get into someones way to get acknowledged.  I waited 30 minutes for a courtesy shuttle before inconveniencing a family member for a ride.  Upon picking my vehicle up I went through the same shenanigans of standing in the way until acknowledged.  Oh, and all this was with a scheduled appointment.   On the flip side, the vehicle service was performed!< /text>

<date>1568266495913< /date>< Review>
We have a new Jeep Wrangler. We took it too this dealership and were very un impressed. We asked for a five tire rotation as part of our Jeep wave program oil and rotation. The service person refused to do it saying that the “spare” is just for looks. I’m flabbergasted as we’ve never had this issue before at other dealerships. Additionally we had it in for a recall and when we went to pick it up we were given the keys and sent to go find it in the parking lot. No walk thru or pull up. Additionally, after having the recall checked out (something for the steering) the Jeep is now pulling to the right significantly! So now we need to have that checked out and fixed and I’m sure this dealership won’t do much. Wouldn’t recommend.</Review>

Great selection of cars, easy to deal with the sales department and their service is top notch and honest. Another dodge service center had misdiagnosed an alignment problem and I drove an hour to Lodi for an honest 2nd opinion. Saved me thousands!!! Trust earned. Thank you!</Text>

< Review>
I went in there knowing very little about buying a car. It was my first time; 21 years old and seemingly curious. I got to test drive the car that I really liked. They informed me of all the stats on the car. At signing, I got to ask as many questions as I felt comfortable and they reassured me every time. The conversation was very smooth and it calmed my nerves a lot! This made the biggest decision of my life a little less nerve wracking. Everyone here at this establishment was super great! We laughed at jokes and got serious when needed to be. When it was time to pay the down payment, my card wouldn’t go through. So they let me take the car, I wanted to buy from them to go to the bank to get a cashiers check. That was pretty amazing. All in all, this establishment was friendly, kind and attentive! Would recommend everyone!< /Review>

< Review>
I bought my first car from them and it was a great experience. Megan Covarrubias helped me out through this whole experience and explain everything. I have been to several dealers when accompanying my parents buy other cars and none have been as transparent as this dealer. They even brought out a chart explaining things like msrp,discounts, add ons, and rebates; which ultimately gave me the final price I was going to pay. I have to say I am extremely pleased with this experience. One thing I should also mention is that I bought the car at a great price, I checked car gurus and it was one of the lowest price (biggest discounts) in all California. Overall I highly recommend this dealer and Megan to anyone.</Review>

I have purchased 2 vehicles from Lodi CDJR, and have had an excellent experience both times. The sales staff and finance department have been a pleasure to deal with and have made purchasing a new vehicle an enjoyable experience instead of stressful one. For many years I was a Ford enthusiast,  but with the quality and price point of Dodge/Ram,  I'm proud to say we are a Mopar family.  When you are ready for a new ride, hit up Cody and the sales staff. They will take good care of you.< /text>

<text>Very nice, entire staff courteous and helpful.
No one pushy ! Went out of their way to find us just what we were looking for in a truck.
Worked for us to get the right amount for our trade in and for the best price and financing for the new truck we picked out ! We went there, from West Sacramento because of the good selection!</text></record>

<Text>Steve Magana is a good man, and a great salesman The deal was made pretty simple. I got preapproved beforehand, went to the dealership and found the Challenger RT that I wanted. There was no need in price haggling because that was already the best price in California for that vehicle with the options it had. Glad I did my homework. Happy Holiday's to everyone there at Lodi CDJR.

Will not wash windows in a used car so you can see the road to drive home! Beware of excessive mileage on vehicle. My car I bought (2016 Toyota Corolla LE ECO) was advertised with 42,000 miles...but the odometer showed 49,000 miles.

Ask for record of service the dealership might have done.  Carefully check the CarFax on the vehicle you wish to purchase.  The Corolla I had purchased was previously in an accident.

Don't fall for maintenance plan from them on a used vehicle. I was set up with a maintenance plan that cost $2,500 - and was an additional $250 PER MONTH in addition to the car payment.  I cancelled the plan immediately.

NEVER GOING BACK!!</review>< Gmap_id>

They advertised a vehicle for a good price, they had that vehicle on the lot for the advertised price, and we bought it. No games, no delays and no double talk. Everyone was very cordial and friendly. Even though there were dealers closer to us, they wanted significantly more for the same auto. We would recommend this dealership without hestitation.< /Text>

I brought my vehicle in for service and was helped by Tim who after he took my keys got in my truck let my door swing ! And then after that he still goes on and peels off into another parking spot which was extremely unnecessary NEVER BRINGING IT AGAIN ! If that’s how they treat other people’s cars with them present I can only imagine when the owner isn’t there.<//Review>

<Review>I had a great experience at the Lodi CDJR! I went in looking for a new Jeep Wrangler to find out brand new just wasn't in the cards for me right now. I had Marshall as a sales rep and Shannon as my finance rep both of which were extremely helpful through the entire process. Later the same week Marshall called us right away to let us know a jeep with everything I was looking for had come in and to come take loot. It was perfect! Shannon and Marshall were so fast with the process of both purchasing the new car and with the process of trading in my old car, I was called multiple times with updates and the communication was great! Over all had a great experience with Lodi CDJR!<//Review><Name>Tiffany Starr< /Name><user>116568815429222720554<//user>< Pictures>

<Review>Took a little work and communication but after we got that out of the way it was great. Everyone is polite. Speedy. Helpful. I recommend the dealership overall from sales to finance to mechanics. The only tarnish was the communication at times. Overall I recommend highly.</Review><Rate>4</Rate></record>

The sales and finance department are by far some of the best and most professional I have dealt with got me into the truck I wanted no issues. But the same can not be said about the service department every time I have brought my truck in it has been nothing but issues. Things as simple as calling the customer back or making sure you've actually completed the job would be a good start. Had to take it back 3 times to get over spray paint removed and the job still wasn't finished after the 3rd time and now the call my employer to get ahold of me for a shuttle ride when not 10 minutes before I had given them a number to  Call me. All in all i would buy from lodi dodge for all my cars but avoid the service department if you want your vehicle and your sanity!< /review>

<text>Tom in service is the best.  I consider him my own personal service advisor (even though he is not) and goto him directly with all of my needs.  He is knowledgeable, responsive and a great person to boot.  What you look for in someone caring for your vehicle.  Kudos to Lodi Dodge.< /text>< Date>

< review>
Put this on yelp and figured google should also have my novel of a review. I'm so highly disappointed in the level of service. We are wanting to buy a new RAM rebel. The initial experience was good although short, we knew exactly what we wanted. We didn’t want to waste anyone’s time going on multiple test drives, bringing out cars, etc. We had an appointment elsewhere and had to leave but we filled out the credit app and they (the sales manager/sales person Hensol Cline lll) said that they’d get back to us that afternoon/evening.

Didn’t hear back.. I get that it gets busy, I used to sell cars. Even when it got busy though I was able to multi task and get back to customers no later than 24 hrs (Maybe our dealership had diff standards). So we didn’t hear back until I called them Monday late afternoon/evening. To receive numbers on a car is typically a 20 min process on average even with about 4 deals at the desk. There weren’t that many customers, the sales people were standing out front talking and our sales person was complaining how slow the foot traffic has been. Anyways, when I called I listen to the sales person cut me off multiple times to tell me he didn’t have numbers and how busy it’s been and that he’d get back to me later. At this point I’m annoyed because we’ve been patient it’s been two days and it feels like we are getting brushed off.

70-80% of a sales persons job is following up and at the very least being courteous. I called again to ask for the sales persons name because I wanted to write this review and I get transferred to the sales manager. I told him I just wanted my sales persons name and he wouldn’t give it to me. He then went on to rudely say “I have a pile of deals here what do you want me to do”. To which I said I just asked for my sales persons name (now I know from the business card I found it’s Hensol Cline) then not long after the sales manager abruptly ended the call. Your team is a reflection of you sir.

I still waited to write this review until my dad got called back. He did finally, he missed it because he was driving and called back and they told him that the person putting together his deal is out and will be back tomorrow and they’ll call us then. 2-3 people told us we’d get numbers today. At this point it’s just unprofessional and honestly a lot of games.

I’ve never been treated so poorly. We’ve bought many cars from ford to Jeep, Nissan and 3 from Mercedes. We always we get backend, give perfect CSI’s and it’s generally a very easy experience. Never ever has buying a car been this painful. I would never recommend any of my fam/friends or previous customers of mine to come here.<//review>

Brought the vehicle in service rep took VIN # to schedule appointment.   To not get this done and have to reschedule is frustrating.  It has been a week and have not heard back on status of part.<//text>< pics>

<Review>Extremely shady dealership.  Bait and switch.  Price was agreed on the phone, 1.5 hour drive to arrive at the dealership and was told car had gps and fancy window treatment they cannot take off.  They even tried to put it on the sales contract hoping I would just sign and not read it. You really think I was born yesterday?  I know there are suckers born every minute but come on!!!   They lost a car sale due to nickle and diming. Went to Roseville Dodge and had a much better experience, very straight forward and no hidden cost, no fine print.</Review>< rating>

This was a great experience. Jeff "Oz" Oswald treated as if I was family instead of like a person buying a car. He understood my budget and where I needed to be with my payments. Never once did he pressure me to be over my budget, neither did the fiance guy (think his name was Shannon??) I will refer everyone here.</text>

By all accounts from as far as I could tell the sales department is great there honest, and if your leaving here unhappy the truth is you either didn't listen when making the deal or you shouldn't be buying a car in the first place, I have financed two vehicles here without issue. Also I would like to point out the service staff "For the most part" are also a good group special shout out to a couple tech I know still work there that know there stuff George peck, he's a hell of a mechanic and is honest he won't recommend it if you don't need it. Also he does everything you pay for. And Dave  That being said I realize there is all ways a couple bad eggs in the basket, if you feel you had a bed experience just specifically ask that that same mechanic not work on your cars anymore. I do feel this company did me wrong but that is not here nor there, I am a former employee who was laid off "was told it was due to lack of work" this time. I do believe that over all this is still a reputable company and for the most part is good to do business with.<//review>

<username>Kevin Kelley< /username><text>I love my car.  However, the service center at this dealership is a joke.  Pathetic. Unethical and sleazy. Evasive. This is not hyperbole; I am not exaggerating. Under no circumstances would I recommend buying a car here because they can't and won't support it.  Specifics: brought my car (less than 10k miles in) for repair - they *started off* the conversation by telling me they probably wouldn't be able to resolve my issue - that something that was happening *while a service writer watched* "probably wouldn't be" diagnosed and fixed. Instead I got an earful about how "hard" it was to fix FCA cars "these days." Well, they were right, issue wasn't resolved! Instead, they broke something else.  And went silent - they won't respond. The service manager refuses to return calls and won't respond to emails.  Ditto whoever is running their social media.  They even refused to work with the national DodgeCares Twitter account after I contacted them for help. Really!  Amazing (at least to me) but true. I have extensive documentation of all of this and more!  I stand behind every word I'm writing, I'm happy to share copies of everything. When I have time, we're gonna have a conversation in front of a judge.  Find another dealer.
Post script update a week later: as you can see, several days have passed and the dealer hasn't responded; because what can they say? I can tell you that they haven't reached out privately either. This should tell you everything you need to know.</text><GmapID>0x80907556a3630431:0x5c93fc37952563b2<//GmapID>< Pictures>

< review>
I bought a 2016 Subaru from Lodi dodge I drove it for a week I got a ticket for my ex system that came with the car when I bought it I called the dealer and they told me it's my responsibility cost me $1500.00 drove it for approximately two months the engine blew up When I bought the car I was told the car had a factory warranty  on it so I did not buy an extended warranty so when the engine blew up I had it tow to Subaru they checked it out and I was told it needed an engine and it would not be covered under the factory warranty And the reason why was it had aftermarket parts on it I call the dealer and talk to the GM He told me that it's not their responsibility I bought the car with those parts on it  The dealer told me that I could put those parts on so what I did I got a hold of the original owner I talk to him he told me that he install those parts when he owned the car so after the car been with Subaru for two months It cost me $8000 plus a rental car for over 2 months and the general manager will not even talk to me about it it's really sad they would treat the customers this way I could not make the payments on the car and pay for the engine so I got three months behind on my payment so I could pay for the engine and kept the car stay away from this Dealer</review>

<review>Went in "just to look around"...Mike the Sales Rep was patient, answered all my questions, and made me feel very relaxed and didn't put pressure on me to drive off the lot with a car. I appreciate that... thank you Mike. Jimmy in the finance dept had us walking out confident in our decision to make our purchase without regret. Great place to stop and look around! Highly recommend Lodi CDJR.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< date>

Phillip and Andy were very good.  No pressure.  I liked that I was not attacked when I first drove in to look at the Chargers/Challengers and  all the sales staff were standing there but they let me look and did not swarm me.  I love my White Lightning.<//Text>

Came back on Monday
It was Shannon day off ? But we meet with another awesome sales person Mike Wow your staff had bent over backwards.He pickup were Shannon Left off my wife and I decided to Co-sign for our Daughter and was given the best deal possible
And  Elliott He was Awesome also.So the Biggest Thing I could say is you’re STAFF AT LODI Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Is Way Above & Be On
5 STAR Quality Thank you for making this  experience a Very Happy 😊 one My Daughter Love Her New To Her Car!! I feel better knowing She got a  dependable car and that means the world to me.

We had a check engine light issue and they took us in right away.  It took several days since they had to order the parts.  When th parts came in, they realized they only had one but before calling us, they called around to other dealers and the tech picked up the part on his way home and installed it the next day.  Raymond, our Service Advisor, and Cliff, the technician were fantastic to deal with.  Thank you.</review>

< Review>
Been dealing with a salesperson an one of his managers trying to help me in a rough spot current repo an super bad credit score told me to bring in 6k I said okay then I found out they have a current cash allowance/ incentive I was simply asking if it could be applied to the downpayment I was told no even whe. It could be they would have to work a deal to try to make it happen but no one tried and was talked to with disrespect the salesman did great but his manager was rude and didn't wanna even try his best to help in anyway an told me " I cant help you" now I BBN you want the current dollar days deal you wont get it cuz once tax title an license comes out you dont see the incentive/rebate and when you ask them to try an see if the bank would even take it they refuse   will be making a YouTube video on this bad situation and go from there and explain incentives on

Owner took the low road ban bashes my credit score because I called to explain my review an why I gave a 1 star very disrespectful when a customer gets yelled at by your sales manager who didnt TRY TO HELP BUT TOLD YOU HE DID AND THE GENERAL MANAGER GETS ON   THE PHONE DOWN TALKING SOMEONE NOT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THEM AN HANGS UP IN THERE FACE THAT SHOWS BAD LEADERSHIP< /Review>

I WILL NOT RECOMMEND DO NOT GO HERE.
The service of this facility does not even come close to the need of recieving a star. (Negative STAR needed)
The service department is filled with COMPLETELY RUDE and ARROGANT people.
Even the manager I spoke to was rude and disrespectful.
Buy a Jeep ELSEWHERE.
I WILL NOT RECOMMEND Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram, 1255 Beckman Rd, Lodi, CA 95240

Lodi Dodge went above and beyond for me to get my truck taken truck care of.  Tom the service rep is a great guy and kept me informed on how my truck was doing.  I was out of town for work while my truck was in the shop but I knew I did't need to worry because I knew it was in good hands.  I recommend Lodi to everyone both for sales and service.</Review>

Great place to shop for new trucks, friendly, helpful staff.

Felt as if management (Shannon) was talking at me and not to me as an adult and closing the door for options and wanted cash and No alternatives. Disrespectful is how I can put it. Charlie was the biggest help with revealing a same truck but used and I was fine with that for closing the deal to meet everybody’s needs. Finance department was solid with explaining all of the details of the sale before making it final as well.</Text>

1st experience dropping my car off and the service advisor Tom locks my keys in the car by pushing the lock button and shutting door with my keys inside. I picked up my car a week after dropping it off due to needing a torque clutch converter that was under warranty. I get it back and a few days later a faulty job on the converter caused it to lose all the transmission fluid while sitting in my drive way. They had it towed and fixed that.  I have been hesitant to drive it since. Noticed the hood was not shut all the way. I opened it and found dealer tools in my engine compartment. They called me and wanted to buy the vehicle back, I can see why now. They wanted their tools back with out taking responsibility for leaving them in my engine. Im dissatisfied with my whole experience.< /review>

Do not bring your car here to be repaired!!!! This place is a joke. You will get charged for "work" that was never even done.... they were supposed to repair my seat got it back in worse condition than before and charged my warranty place for an entire new seat that they admitted was never even ordered..... kept my car for days... never aligned my car.... when my car was finally ready went to pick it up and they said they would leave my car unlocked and put the key under the seat.... HA yeah they locked my damn keys in the car and I had to wait an hour outside with my daughter and fiance for the locksmith to show up to get my keys out. Worse experience I have ever had... the sales people there do seem nice it's the service area that is a joke.<//review>

<text>The only thing that was good about my experience with this dealership was the deal on the car I bought. The salesman didnt care about any questions or concerns I had once he knew I was sold on the car, if I hadn't needed a car so badly I'd have walked out. When I bought the car it had a plastic trunk liner, they had the car derailed and it was gone when I came to pick up the car. I have brought it to their attention 3 times and keep gett ing brushed off. Just a heads up to anyone looking to buy a car here they're not looking for your satisfaction past the moment you purchase.< /text><rating>1< /rating><gmapID>0x80907556a3630431:0x5c93fc37952563b2< /gmapID><pictures>None</pictures>< name>

If you want to over pay for a new or used car, come here! Only dealer I’ve been to that is completely unwilling to “deal” with the customer. I had Andy as a salesman and he and the sales manager were unwilling to lower the sticker price on a brand new vehicle! I’ve bought many cars and EVERY dealer drops the sticker price because they all know it’s marked up so they can make the most money, even when they “do you a favor” and drop the selling price. I would never suggest anyone to go here and I will never return.<//text>

Update.....
Not only did i email Terry before posting on here, with no response, but he responded to my review to contact him. Which, I tried again twice, and still have not heard any response in almost a week. Somehow this does not surprise me. Maybe contacting Dodge themselves might help....

Worst experience ever! Was called derogatory names when I said i wanted to go get my pink slip to my old truck and my check book for the deposit. Emailed the manager and never got a response. Very happy with my Chevy i ended up purchasing elsewhere. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!<//text>

<review>The service tech Sara was the best part of this experience. The rest of the experience was less than stellar. From the service cashier who could not be bothered with my questions to the fact that it took 2 days just to get someone to look at my truck before even starting work to the over inflated cost of the repair. I thought Lodi CDJR was under new management? Nope, same story just a different book cover.<//review>< Pics>

My boyfriend and I originally went to Lodi cdjr just to get an idea of what we wanted, but Shannon was so great and helpful and gave us a lot of information to work with that we came back a day or two later to get the truck! Juan helped us do all the paperwork and made everything quick and easy. I definitely recommend Lodi cdjr!< /text>

<text>Really wish I could give ZERO stars! Took my 07 Caliber in for an oil change, made an appointment, show up early and they have no record. Was told it'd be about an hour (I sat in the lobby from 8:50am-11:20am) - The guy that helped me was a joke!( his name is Raymond) Not my first time dealing with him. Each time I go in he belittles me. I know my car, I keep excellent records of all services done ( by me or by the dealership) He made the comment he's not use to women knowing about the mechanics of a car. ( this is where I lay into him ans tell him I am a Mechanics daughter was taught how to work on cars before I could even reach the pedals! ) and this time as I was walking out of the service department he whistles and mumbled something in Spanish. I've heard how he is with female costumers VS the males. Don't be so sexist with your customers. I am in the market for a new car and will NOT be going back to Lodi Dodge ever again!< /text><Gmap_id>0x80907556a3630431:0x5c93fc37952563b2</Gmap_id><userid>102614652928376543329< /userid><user_name>Angela Smith</user_name></record>

Tom was super helpful. I bought a Chrysler aspen from a small dealer in sac. Shady place gave me keys that didn’t work. The key faub had a short in it so when they replaced the batteries and it worked I drove it home. Fast forward to the next morning the key doesn’t work again. Couldn’t lock the doors for a week. Called Tom, he ordered me new keys and I drove it down for him to program them. Easy peasy, out on the road in thirty minutes. Thanks Tom!!!<//text>

DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP! THEY ARE EXTREMELY NICE WHEN YOU FIRST BUY THE CAR. THE NIGHTMARE BEGINS THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY CALL YOU BACK IN. THE DEAL WE MADE THE NIGHT BEFORE WON'T WORK WITH THE BANK. SO, THEY GIVE YOU ANOTHER CONTRACT AND SAY THIS IS THE BEST THEY CAN DO. YOU TAKE IT BECAUSE YOU WANT THE CAR. THEN TWO DAYS LATER, THEY CALL YOU AGAIN AND SAY YOU OWE THEM MONEY BECAUSE YOUR TRADE IN LENDER MADE A MISTAKE ON THE PAYOFF. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I GOT A PAYOFF QUOTE STANDING THERE IN THE DEALERSHIP AND GAVE IT TO THE SALESMAN. IN REALITY, THE DEALERSHIP WROTE THE WRONG PAYOFF BUT WON'T TAKE THE BLAME. I GO IN AND DROP OF THE CHECK TO THE GENERAL MANAGER AND TELL HIM I WON'T BUY ANOTHER CAR FROM THEM AGAIN AND WALK OFF. AS I'M WALKING AWAY HE'S CALLING ME BUDDY AND TELLING TO WAIT. SO, I STOP TO LISTEN AND ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS TELL ME NOT TO COME BACK AGAIN AND STORMED OFF. WORTHLESS!<//text>

Salesperson lied. Now I find out the finance company didn’t agree with the terms but will agree to modified terms that were sent to the dealer. Called the dealer and was transferred to the finance department. No answer twice. Receptionist said they are busy and get back with me right away. Over an hour and a half and still waiting.< /Text>

Terrible experience, recently purchased a brand new 2917 Chrysler 300 in October and it has been in the shop over 5 times now for the same issues over and over.  This past visit I was able to bring in 2 videos of the separate issues as they occurred and the generic response I get it “we can’t duplicate it”.   Smh terrible service, any other dealer I’ve dealt with in the past would’ve held onto the car until it was fixed.  They would’ve trouble shooter with other local dealers and mechanics, but instead it’s in and out.  If car isn’t replaced or bought back I will be taking legal action under CA LEMON LAW.</Text>

<Text>HORRIBLE dealership .

We were getting ready to head towards a dodge dealership in gilroy cause they offered us a deal , Lodi called me and said they’d match it .

We drive an hour to Lodi , they offered us a payment 230 dollars more than what we were offered from the other dealership . He basically chuckled and said it’s not possible for us to get something cheaper . Mind you , this was a 3 year lease with 740 credit score .

It was too late for us to drive to gilroy so we went to Manteca , they offered us 520 a month , 3 year lease and the process took only an hour . On a 2019 scatpack with 3 Miles . They told us 630 for a 2018 scatpack with 200 Miles .

I suggest you guys head over to Manteca dodge instead . I hope the manager and finance guy from Lodi sees this .< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I was stranded in Jackson ,Ca and Tom was amazing in taking care of all the details to repair my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee and get me back on the road. Everyone else was quoting me weeks before they could “fit me in”
Thank you Tom and all the folks at Lodi Jeep for rescuing me and getting me back on the road so quickly!<//Text>< UserId.>

<Review>Called this dealership about a car I wanted the salesman was nice enough on the phone so I told him when I would be down, I didn't expect him to know me or run out on the lot, but no one came out to greet me as I walked all around the lot,(that never happens at any dealership that I have been too, that should have been a red flag) So I called the salesman on his cell phone and he told me the car I wanted was on hold, the car ended up being on hold for 3 days when supposedly they don't do that. They sold the car, but I found another at a different dealership. The two stars is for the salesman for his follow-up; the dealership and its management get zero stars. Based on the few reviews posted this place is hit or miss.<//Review><Time>1454367791539< /Time><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Took 5 hours for an oil chance, tire rotation and wash. I dropped it of at 9AM and left with it at 2PM.
My pickup had to be washed twice. The first time it was returned covered in greasy smudges and the windows were smeared.
The previous times it was in for serice I was charged $10 for the tire rotations. This last time I was charged $25 for the rotation. Not sure if it's due to new ownership.<//Text>

My 2000 Cirrus is a garage sitter & occasional short trip taker. It has 34000 miles on it & when it requires service or any other mechanical attention I leave my vehicle in the qualified hands of Chrysler certified mechanics Lodi CDJR. If I have anything done to my vehicle it is going to be done by a mechanic that specializes in Chrysler. Lodi CDJR is honest, reputable & serves their customers with courteous, professional service which has a touch of personal care incorporated with the manner in which their customers are valued...   ;~)<//text>

< Review>
I brought my 01 dodge ram in to diagnose what the issue was with my fuel gauge and to see if my water pump was going out because of the noise it was making. A job that should take 5 min took all day and I never got a straight answer on what they did to determine that in fact they were both bad. Charged me 160.00 dollars to do a safety check. What a joke that is. They said they checked my brakes but they never took the wheels off and I have drumb brakes. How do you see through the wheels I would like to know. Also the guy helping me was not a help at all. Ramirez at Lodi dodge never answered my calls and made me wait once I got there for 30 min to sign some paperwork. Then I had to wait while they had to go find my truck. Terrible!!!</Review>

Horrible experience with the service dept. We have taken our 2017 Ram 5 times to fix the windshield wipers from coming on by themselves. We ended having to take the fuse out to drive the truck around. The 5th time it was in their service dept for 5 days. They called us to pick up. when we got it, The fuse was still in the same spot where we left it and once we put it in, sure enough the windshield wipers turned on and we couldn't turn them off. How are they going to keep our truck for almost a week and not fix a damn thing.. I wouldn't never recommend this place it to anyone.</text>

And my door handle was broke throughout the process of my car being there which I was called back there to get the door handle put on but somebody ordered the wrong one and it has been at least another 2-3 weeks that my car door handle has been broken.

Apparently nobody put this in their system and mention that the car had a problem from the jump when I got it and that I had been there three different times with no solution to this and mr. Ochoa don't work there anymore (bad news for me, Great for them) and this Eric of a manager had the nerve to say he cannot say if I'm telling the truth about the car having this problem when I bouhgt it so there is nothing he can do about it..DON'T BUY FROM THEM..Ridiculous customer service and dishonest people.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80907556a3630431:0x5c93fc37952563b2</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

My brand new 2018 charger begin to shake badly afther 20 minutes  left the dealer and when l call them they just told me to go to the nearest dodge service. And that was my last talk with them.
Afther that , from the sales person to the sales manager and general manager nobody answer or return to my calls.
Also , when l check my purchase details l found a different for.2.820 Usd over charged to my total amount. Than l learn from the finance manager that he add 1.370 Usd for GPS trucking system together with windshield protection. ( In the beginning he said the GPS is coming with the car together and never mention for any price or payment )
And 1.450  Usd for 6 years mechanical coverage. . ( l reject all the additional insurance and coverage offers from the finance manager while the signing process but still add the coverage. )
Afther talk couple of times with the second finance manager ( l couldn't reach to the first one as expected ) he said that l will get back the mechanical coverage and windshield protection but the GPS can not removed from the car....

Stay Away!!!
Summer of 2017 (June)
Dodge caravan was misfiring really bad. Took it to dodge and they put a left cylinder head in my caravan keeping it for couple weeks and costing $3200. Took it home and found filter air box and wires were loose and not secured properly on and around the manifold. 8k miles later cylinder head was leaking oil.
Summer 2018 (June)
Took it back to dodge and the said yes it is leaking they will order head gasket kept van for a week. Service dept. Calls me and tells me camshaft also needs to be replaced i give a go ahead which is another $290 for camshaft and 6 rocker arms and 6 tappets. Got it back on saturday evening and found airbox and all the wires loose again and couple of metal brackets. Was very upset sent videos to the dealership rightaway and they said they will make sure my advisor gets the videos on Monday. But on sunday i take van for a drive and it felt like misfiring again at a red light and while driving. I got back in dodge and told em its heating up after the rework and getting only 16 miles to a gallon when it always had been getting over 17 in city and also misfiring. They send a tech with me on a drive. Engine did shutter i could feel it but tech sitting in the back seat could not (van does not have front passenger seat or middle row). It has loss of power i told them and i can clearly tell. I told tech my van and advisor my was leaking oil from cylinder head but atleast it was running fine and after rework now on cylinder this engine is not the same anymore. They said we will hook it up and see if there is a misfire. Nothing else we can do because we worked on the cylinder head. I said yes you took all apart and worked on the cylinder head and might have missed something when putting everything back. I am a regular driver of the van so i know when van is not acting right.  Advisors are nice but techs don't know what they are doing. It is too much headache. Trust me stay away from lodi dodge service depts. Its been nothing but pain. I am stuck with a broken van if they dont fix this sudden engine sutter/thumping issue. What makes dodge think after after missing work for 3 weeks, repais costing over $3600 and stress about van that i will come back to them for service?
JUNE2018
Dodge said they could not any misfiring symptoms etc. and maybe a ignition coil pack going bad. They give van back to me...
JULY2018
Only after 8 days  and less than 1000 miles later van was back at the dealership it was leaking oil from the cylinder head again 😔. Tom advisor said leave it and we will look at it. Next day Tuesday tom calls me and tells me they will order a whole new cylinder head and crysler said part is back ordered and estimate arrival date for part is July 31 2018. I said thats almost 3 weeks😤😟. Advisor also said that's not a guarantee they'll have the part on that date.
JULY 30 2018
i call dealership to get an update... Advisor said they got the part and tech is working on the van as we speak. I said ok good thanks.
JULY 31 2018
i get a call from advisor that they were putting cylinder head in and a chunk of block came in techs hand. He said bolts threads came out and now van needs a new Motor.  He said dealership spoke to chrysler and Chrysler said they will cover Labor cost to put in new motor but not cover the new motor. Tom said new motor is $5800 and the 2nd option is to trade in this vehicle for another vehicle. Really Dodge? 😠 I said Tom i have missed 6 weeks of my work so far from June 2017 to July 2018 because of dealership keeping the van. I have spent over $3600 and problem is still not fixed and on top of that dealership messed up the engine and chrysler is asking me to pay for motor? And not to mention the stress i took every time they keep the vehicle and i miss work. I have lost clients and am at the brink of losing my job. I said dealership took it apart 3 times in those 3 visits i made so far,  they should cover everything. Tom said i will tell my boss and they will be the one making the call. 8/14/2018 They made me pay for used LKQ motor $2441.61 :(<//Text>

Lack of personality and very unclear on their process of selling a car. The sales man didn't  seem interested in selling, no effort or personality. The sales manager very unprofessional I have never came across these problems while car buying seem like they were trying really hard to rip me off or not even make the sell. I'm probably buying my car somewhere else.</text>

<Time>1503776134568< /Time><rating>1<//rating><text>DON'T go here for service. I brought my perviously owned Jeep Wrangler here for a general service check. First I wanted them to see why the traction lights wouldn't go off. Additionally, I wanted them to check the brakes and any other issues they might find. They ended up "resetting" the traction lights, changed the oil and transmission fluid. Was told the brakes were fine. $500.00 later we left. The next day the traction lights came back on, was told I could return in about a week for another appointment.  Two months later and approximately 200 miles the brakes started to grind, took it to Les Schwab and we ended up having to replace all four routers and brake pads! Additionally, we were made aware of 3 recalls that Lodi never told us about. I recently took it to Carson City Jeep for the recalls and they informed me the water pump was bad, the oil pan was leaking and the recall took care of the traction lights. There was NO way Lodi could reset the traction lights because there was a faulty part that the recalls took care of. Thanks to Carson City Jeep My Jeep now runs great!!  THANKS FOR NOTHING LODI JEEP!!!   I like to spend my money locally, but I will NEVER return to this service department again. If I could I would give them zero stars<//text>< Pics>

Honestly I wouldn’t come here and do business with Lodi Dodge again.... I rather go to a different dealership. The person “ helping” me  didn’t even have the time to let me speak. Everything was rushed, they say what you want to hear but don’t be fooled. I asked the sales person and the finance manager if I would have to contact the dmv for anything after trading in my car, they said no so I would confident of not having to worry about the dmv sending me anything later in the mail about the  old car.... BUT nope, a month and two weeks later I got a letter saying I need to renew my car registration “ the car I traded in” even though I signed off that car I still got this notice. I read on the DMV that I have to fill out a form out and I tried but didn’t have the option of trading in the car info so I contacted the sales person that helped me and told me “ it happens all the time no worry I’ll have my person send you a copy” later on that day got a message saying they weren’t able to get the copy for whatever reason so I called the next morning and talked to the finance manager and told me I should just ignore it, it happens all the time and I don’t need to contact them about it but HE WILL SEND ME A COPY OF RELASE OF LIABILITY... a couple of hours passed by and still didn’t get a copy sent to my email. Waited until the next day mid day and messaged and called  the  person  who “ helped “ me and no response. This place is very unprofessional and deserves  zero stars.< /review>

< review>
I am very pleased with my experience here at Lodi Dodge. I am originally from Stockton, and had a horrible experience at my Dodge location. I looked around online, and came across Lodi Dodge, and I am very happy I did! This location has a wide variety of cars, new and used. The salesmen, and mangers here are very nice and respectful, unlike Stockton. My husband and I been eyeballing the Dodge Durango’s for awhile now. They have a good selection here, and my husband really liked the black one. The salesman let us test drive the car, and we got to experience the Durango’s full potential. Having a toddler, and a 3 months old baby, we needed to upgrade to a bigger car immediately. The vehicle is very spacious, and accommodates my children’s car seats and strollers perfectly, and still has A LOT of space left. We are pleased to say the Durango best fits my family, and our needs. After going over some numbers, our salesman, Jose Delgado, got to work things out for us, and got us approved for a good deal on the Durango. Jose was very nice and straight forward. I am happy to say we came here looking for a Durango, and left with one the same night. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone, Jose Delgado, and the rest of his team, are very professional and nice. My family will be doing more business with them in future for sure. Thank you Lodi Dodge!<//review>

I recieved great Service from Raymond Ruiz at Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram. I came in for an  air bag recall, and they inspected the vehicle for other problems, and discoved that the front brakes were severely worn. Since I had just purchased the Jeep from Carmax the week before, Raymond suggested that I bring it back to them for service. I have scheduled an appointment with Carmax. Thanks for the great service and attention to detail Raymond.< /text>

Very disappointed . I took the car in to have keys programmed and was given a quote for 80$. The estimate said customer understands that there is no guarantee the fobs would work since they weren't bought from them. Ok I can deal with that... Left the car there overnight and get a call that the keys aren't programming with the car. They tell me it's 165$ to run a diagnostic to see if the computer modules bad and asked how much this would run me if it was the module.she says about $365. Later after they did the diagnostic I get call saying yup the module is bad, and I the total to repair was just over $1100, don't want to proceed,?. And that and I had to decline for now. When I go to pick up the car, it's $245 to get my car back and im told I'm being charged the 80 for the attempt to program the keys plus diagnosis. Now wheree did it say customer understands or acknowledges if the key doesn't program I still have to pay $80. I was already having to pay the diagnostic of bad news  The female who acts like she's running  the place was not helpful nor very friendly, when I asked about this she said there was nothing she could do, that whether or not it was programmable she had to pay the guy who tried. I asked to speak to the manger only to be told he was off , how on Earth can u charge someone for a service you didn't get without disclosing this could happen? Can you imagine if I would have said ok to go ahead and replace the computer module going wit the earlier quote  of 365.00? And been then be told I'd have to pay 1200+ when I showed up for my car??! I'm livid that I had to pay 240 to walk away with nothing . I'll never use this dealership in the future and you have been forewarned. Price gouged and no disclosures.<//review>

I asked how much and if they would find and report the problem. The guy wrighting up tag yes to if theres a problem that it will be found and reported, cost would be 160.00. The next day the guy calls me and said were going have to run a compression test for another 500.00 dollars to figure whats wrong.my reply was,"so your telling me 660.00 dollars then you possibly still wouldn't be able to tell me whats wrong? He's reply was yes. I say thats not what you told me and im comeing to pick my truck up. I pick my truck up and the paperwork was changed from the original to benefit the guy that wrote it up with rearrange words to benefit him or i should say the dealership. And i still had to pay 160.00 for not one thing that they did but lies. I strongle beleave they dident even look at it. Due to there inspection reported said a bunch of things that were lies. Like i neede a new air filter, and a major service and flush on tranny. Less then a mo. Before i changed the filter and 2 filters/fluid in tranny. I bet there hasent been one elderly lady that hasent been taken addvantage of ...... I no was ripped off. And lied to.

I have bought 2 vehicles from Lodi CDJR. in the last 6 months.  I will continue to but from them.  There GREAT!!!  All so nice.  Ask for Marty Stevens for sales and Mike for finace, Their both very good at their jobs.
Marty won't waste your time, tell him exactly what your looking for and he will do the work of looking for the right vehicle for you.  Than Mike will get you through finance in a record breaking time.  So if your time is valued to you go to Lodi CDJR. and get what you want.
Have a GREAT day!!!

<Text>What can I say about this place. 2 words IT SUCKS. I was dealing with the internet fleet sales manager Marty Steve's. I saw an ad for the vehicle I wanted and asked Marty I want it for that price. Marty said yeah I can give it to you for that price but you have to come today. So I did and guess what Marty made false promises. I also waited there 5 hours to sign paperwork and Marty was jumping back and fourth customers and was being unprofessional about leaving me alone minutes at a time. He even told me go pick a vehicle within the price range of what I was looking for and he could work something out for me. I wasted my time. He didn't do squat for me. Absolutely nothing. All a sales tactic. People if you are reading other reviews it's true this place is horrible. Marty your customer service sucked. You asked me to write a good review for you but how can I? I'm not a liar like you. You lie for living and I get it but someday you will answer to someone right? Hope you feel good about it now. Anyways while waiting hours to see the finance manager all Marty talked about was his personal life how his wife left him and he barely sees his kid. I have a family to man and you guys really left me dry for a while before I got out of there. Oh and Marty you guys are not the cheapest in California for that Ram tradesman I bought just a another sales pitch lie though right? Maybe that's why your ex left you. Just saying. When i finally got with the finance manager my interest rate that we shook hands on Marty on a 3.5 percent didn't even happen but i shouldnt be surprised by another lie right Marty? Also the finance manager was pressuring me to buy extended warranty I mean so much pressure I almost said yes but thank God I said No! That Assyrian guy should be lucky i forgot his name or id be bashing you here to. You pressured me like 30 times to get extended warranty and you even mentioned that you could drop my interest rate if I were to get it. I did a lot of research you do know your tactics are illegal correct. Telling me my interest would get better with extended warranty is illegal that really should be a fireable offense. Oh by the way if your reading this review they add an additional 895 to your costs for the tracking of the vehicle. They will tell you it's included or a free service but it is NOT. Also they forgot to give my ID back to me. MARTY FORGOT IT IN THE COPIER. How unprofessional is that. I got lucky though he took it home with him but I still had to drive 20 miles to his house to pick it up lucky me but he also left the key tracker with me which I also returned to Marty. People if you are still reading my review don't do business with Marty he's been lieing to customers for 20 something years. I know he's been there 20 years cause all he did was brag about it. Do yourself a favor go somewhere else. Seriously these people will do you wrong. Wish I wouldn't have jumped the gun but it is what it is I can only learn from it and let others know. Take your business elsewhere please.<//Text><GmapID>0x80907556a3630431:0x5c93fc37952563b2<//GmapID><Response>None</Response><date>1498904198830</date><userid>109270699048829913189< /userid>< rate>

In 2003, I bought my new Jeep Grand Cherokee from a different dealership on this lot.  I have only 56K miles on my Jeep to date.  I do a lot of my own service because of bad and poor experiences in the past.  The experience I have had at Lodi CDJR is one just as bad if not worse.  I originally took my Jeep in on 8/6/16 to have the air bag recall performed and to get an estimate for a check engine light.  (smog related).  For my jeep when it comes to smog issue, I want factory parts. Lodi CDJR furnishes a courtesy shuttle. (I need to rely on the courtesy vehicle because my Jeep is our only vehicle)  My Jeep was ready that day for pickup  (parts were ordered and I needed the vehicle ). I asked if the shuttle could pick me up. I was asked what time. I said 1 o'clock. They agreed.  I waited until 2:30 to call the dealer asking where my ride was. I was told they were just leaving.  I brought my Jeep in first thing Monday morning and got a ride home on the shuttle. At around 11:30 I was called saying my Jeep was ready.  I said I needed a ride. I was told they do not have anyone available at this time. They would call me when they did.  I waited until almost 3:30. I called the dealership back. I was told they just found someone that could get me. Then I waited another 45 minutes for the ride.  When I picked up my Jeep my front passenger door window was down about 4 inches and would not go up or down. Ended up being a repair I would have to do. They would not repair unless I paid to have it repaired.  All the windows were up when I left my vehicle that morning. My thought  is someone slammed the door that broke the cable on the regulator. The next day I tried no less than 6 times to call Robert, the service manager, who was always busy or not in. The operator told me I needed to leave  him a voice mail with my name and number and he would call me back. I left Robert  a voice mail with my name and number on 8/9/16 . I AM STILL WAITING AND IT IS MONDAY THE 15TH. Robert don't waste my time now with a phone call. My Jeep is a 2003 with low miles and very clean, at no time during any of the work being done was my seat covered with plastic to protect the vehicle seat from the dirty clothes of the mechanics.  My Jeep now gets 13.7 miles per gallon, it was getting 18.2 miles per gallon before they worked on it.  I will never buy, recommend or have any work done on any of my vehicles at Lodi CDJR.  I was thinking of buying a new Grand Cherokee Jeep and pass this one to one of my grand kids. If I do it will not be from this dealership.
For the mileage problem I found the cover from the air cleaner to the top of the fuel injection installed wrong. I reinstalled the cover and retrained the computer and now I have my good mileage back.  It is really to bad when the customer has to repair what the professionals work on. My personal recommendation use caution and think twice before dealing with Lodi CDJR.</Text>

<Text>Andy is the worst sales person on the planet. He will lie to you and waste your time. Go to any other dealership if possible. If you go here to purchase a vehicle you will have the a terrible experience. This piece of crap had me bring my wife and two year old to the dealership after he lied to my face.<//Text></record>

(1) your service department, charged me more than my $100 00 repair deductible, approved by my insurance company.

(2) your finance department did not disclose a complete purchase order, price amount to my Credit Union, for the purchase price on the 2018 Dodge, 350 pickup I was trying to buy.

(3) Your finance manager/Department caused (3) Credit report hits that has now damage my credit score..... I was told there would be only (1) hit....</Review>

Don't believe they have low prices or specials. Its just a way to get you into see if they can get you to buy something else. And they don't tell you that you have 5 year windshield repair added to the contract</Review>

The truth is that they do not fit the truth, I do not recommend because I am sorry to buy a truck from that place, now they made me feel like a fraud, I am not going to take care of me, do not happen the same
