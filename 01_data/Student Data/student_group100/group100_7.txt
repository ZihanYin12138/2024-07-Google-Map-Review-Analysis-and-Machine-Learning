Really nasty. I will never order form here again. Their "flan" is packaged and not even real flan at all its pudding. Worst chimichanga ever the shrimp tasted rancid. I don't usually say stuff but this place was horrible. Enchiladas sucked.</Text>

Convenient little spot. But I can't reccomend. Food was not up to par. Inside the seating area there was dirty tables and many used, unwashed, stacked dishes above the trash can.  My family all found the same thing: Super Burritos (+the bean &CHEESE) didn't contain any cheese, the beans and meats were all unseasoned, refried beans were just whole beans not refried and the chips were so stale it hurt to chew after a few bites. Everything was wrong here and I write this as my stomach is turning looking at what is left of my no Verde -chile Verde burrito.< /Text>

This place really is over priced and terrible food. I will never order from here again. I feel bad leaving a bad review but this is a disgrace to Mexican food. Oh and don't advertise Flan when you are selling packaged pudding instead.</Text>

<text>Ordered 2 burritos...
One had no cheese when cheese was ordered and burrito was very plain.
2nd burrito had no salsa even though we paid for it, wasn't really good either.
Would not recommend or return here.< /text>< Rating>

The burritos are amazing. They are huge. So one can will be a good option for 2 people. There is a small area to eat inside.< /Review>

I order here all the time. They have okay burritos but it's their salsa that is incredible. HOWEVER, 9/10 they don't read the instructions when ordering so I never have a correct order. I'm finally done ordering from this restaurant.< /Text>

<text>Horrible service. Had ordered tacos and was served the wrong order. We then explained that we didnt order that and that we wanted tacos. The cashier charged us for the wrong meal and we told her we want a refund for the difference because it costs more than the tacos. She then said that they can't refund.

I asked the woman nicely as I could, so she treated me very well too. Huge burrito that makes you full for least 6hrs.
Saw a lot of locals going for takeaway, which makes it more special since where locals eat are valuable.</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>back in 2009 when I worked at Goodwill through CJP, I always got my lunch here. Always a Super Burrito with no beans, and an horchata. I loved this place, and the man and lady who worked here were really great people in my opinion. I haven't been here in 11 years now, and I miss this place. I cant go there anymore because I'm all the way in southern Cali now. I will go here again if I ever get the chance though, just to see how things are now and get  a super burrito again for the first time in YEARS! Down here in the far south of California, there's no super burritos...just a "Cali burrito" which comes close but doesn't actually hit the mark.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

My vegetarian fajita burrito was seriously as long as my forearm. Served hot, fresh and delicious with chips. This place is obviously a hit with local workers because there were several here on their lunch break. I wasn't sure what to expect from a tiny market with a small restaurant, but the food was incredible. Definitely marked this one for a return visit.</review>

<review>Their Guacamole is the best!! It's not just avocado smoothie like most restaurants do, it actually has a tangy flavor and you can still taste the avocado in every bite.

Don't get fooled by the location of the restaurant. This place is the bomb!! And they don't skimmed you out with meat portions. There's so much meat in their burrito and Tacos< /review></record></dataset><record>

Prices are ok and portions are big but the food is bland and flavorless. The area it's in is not that great either. I would skip this one if you're from out of town. It seems like locals love it but not much to love.< /review>

The food is amazing. I had the California burrito and super nachos. The taste and look of the food was great. You can see the kitchen from the small seating area they have if you have any worries you are able to watch them cook your food. Not sure if the female that took my order did not speak much English or if she just was not very talkative. While asking about the menu she didn’t have anything to say or when asking for any suggestions from the menu. It made the whole thing feel very uninviting. However, the food was excellent.</Text>

All the basic necessary things needed in a late night Mexican food spot, yummy and priced well, and open pretty late for those ‘after the bar munchies’! The food is pretty decent, and the location is super convenient to many places!</Review>

<review>Great SF Mexican food not in the Mission. Like others have said it's in a grocery store but the flavors are great. Recommend getting the steak super burrito and then not eating anything else that day. Prices are reasonable and it's hard to find this much food for this price anywhere in SF< /review></record>

< Review>
I placed 2 tacos here to go and the meat tasted rotten and cold. The tortilla chips were all thrown around the bag. They didn't put salsa with my tacos despite the fact that I got charged for that.
Terrible customer service and the owner was extremely rude and refuse to refund my order. Won't be back!!</Review>

A great taqueria centrally located. The super burrito was everything you would expect from a 5 star sf taqueria: high quality meat, perfectly layered, spongy yet firm tortilla, tight foil wrap, and delicious spicy table sauce.< /review>

There's a variety of drinks that can be bought in the store part of Los Hermanos. I enjoyed dinner there with a friend recently. We had the roasted chicken dinner for two. It was really nice. I plan to return soon to try their other menu items.< /Review></record>

Places like Los Hermanos is what makes living in the Tenderloin worth it! It is a gem amidst the rough, dirty streets of the TL. The food is always delicious, authentic, plentiful and fresh. They even serve hangover curing menudo on the weekends. I love the unassuming charm of this spot; it really is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.<//Review>

Set inside a grocery store, this is the best taqueria I went to in SF. That doesn't mean it's the best taqueria in SF, but it's gotta be up there. These guys make one hell of a burrito, and their 'regular' nachos are probably enough to feed an average morbidly obese American family of 5.< /text>

<Review>Friendly people, went and bought three tacos & super Quesadilla and loved it. The price for the food was amazing too. About 9 bucks for the Super Quesadilla (which was actually 2 of them) and your usual convenience store with fair prices.<//Review><UserId.>117813756572306633833< /UserId.>< user_name>

Pretty average mexican food. The ingredients looked like they were thrown on a plate. Average quality with very little thought put into seasoning or creativity. That doesn't stop TG them from charging way too much for what you get though. Prices on the menu are meant for the wealthy residents of the town. Don't go.< /Review>

This was a home delivery for me late one night . It costs me 45.00 and it tasted bland and dry and tasteless .I mean I know that this place is probably trying but this is just rediculous for a Mexican style restaurant . They need better customer service too .<//text>

Their burritos smell like garbage and the guac tastes watered down.
They also have really stupid signs everywhere with sassy restrictions. Ex: "you can only get 1 tiny cup of salsa for a taco and 2 for a burrito. IF YOU TAKE ANYMORE WE WILL CHARGE YOU."
Also signs about being polite, accepting that they don't offer wifi in 2017, and "my service depends on your attitude". I came for a burrito not a rant.</text>

You not only asked for 2 salsas, you came back for several more several other times! Wouldn't it be inevitable that you loved the salsa being that you ate enough for ten? Lastly, if you have a complaint, please feel free to return the food and request your money back as we only are interested in serving satisfied customers!

Steven Byrne missed out by not eating his fish taco because everything this place does involving fish really stands out. Their fish quesadilla might be the best food on Geary street, and they'll do a fish chimichanga if you ask for it and wow, it's just so great. Chips and salsa come with your order as standard (it often seems to be a paid-for add-in these days!). Other parts of the menu e.g. meat burritos are fine, but don't stand out massively. The fish is really where it's at.

Don't come here with expectations of haute cuisine or your idea of perfectly accurate 'traditional' Mexican. Come here expecting good quantities of salty cheesy tasty saucy fishy tortilla-y goodness.

Also you can shop while you eat, and the selection in this market is pretty nice! Buy yourself a bottle of wine while you wait for your food to cook. What more could you ask for?< /Review>

Honestamente los burritos están de buen tamaño y buen sabor.
PERO!!!
de mínimo cinco ocasiones e comprado alli comida y desagradablemente SIEMPRE las salsas están rancias, muy cargadas de ajo y con sabor desagradable.
RECOMENDACION.!!!
mejoren sus salsas.<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>We just came early in the morning to look around. It wasn't really open yet. But there is a really nice little garden there with all kinds of women in aviators commemorated. Explaining quite a bit of history. That was nice. And, we could look through the fence and see some of the interesting aircraft they have there. There is a Garden there to Ms Hume I think who helped support and found the museum. The garden is not very well kept.< /text>< Pics>

While ist is small, so you don't need to plan for many hours, but if you are interested in the history of flight and in particular the military aspect of that it has quite number of very nice exhibits in 2 hangars and an open air area. Including some unique pieces and information. Would not have expected such a treasure trove.< /Text>

The museum has a great collection of artifacts, models, and tributes to aviation's pioneers, including women. It's an absolutely lovely little gem in Santa Maria. Kids will love the airplanes and adults will love the history.  Cannot recommend highly enough.<//review><UserId.>114395753940229987502</UserId.>< name>

My children & I recently got a tour of the Museum.  We learned so much about the history of aviation. It was amazing to see all the models of aircrafts. The thousands of models range from a couple inches to actual flown aircrafts. I highly recommend visiting the museum. ❤✈🛫🛬❤<//review>

Very quaint little museum to host a flight history theme. It's intriguing how the Bigelow hangar was a set from Disney's The Rocketeer, which was filmed on the southern part of the air field itself. Much to see and learn about the history of flight, with a pleasant collection of aircraft, including a replica of the Wright Brothers' Flyer.</text>

They do a great job since the are all volunteers.  It's hard to keep a place open operating like that.  But doing so, keeps the entrance fee low.  Great job!< /Review>

Showed up at 10am which was the oiginal time posted a month ago for opening. Found out they opened at 12 and waited. Nobody showed up. Drove 200 miles to see that place. Waisted our time and disapointed 2 kids and their father. How hard would it be to post a sign saying nobody is going to come in? Thanks a lot! What a waist of a trip.<//text>

I'm not sure what the other reviewers saw?  The docents were very rude and their proudest accomplishment was that Disney once shot a 2 star movie there.  Even the airport management dislikes the way this museum is run.<//Review>

That market sell groceries and items for double price more than other markets around the area. Price are crazy and many low income people buy their groceries or any other item there just because is the nearest market and people sometimes doesn’t have a car to go another store. This store need to be reported is too much expensive they are increased prices horrible during Covid-19.<//review>

Used to come here often when I lived nearby. Friendly neighborhood store! Owners are beyond nice and charismatic. Extremely convenient and good prices. Front desk cashier is the best! Miss this store a lot.</text>

I found myself around Pacific Heights today and was really craving a good salad, so I slipped in here for the first time.  I can't say I was impressed with this Whole Foods... The salad bar didn't have half the ingredients as the location in SOME does (no sundries tomatoes, no mixed olives, no red pepper slices, no bleu cheese crumbles, no cups out for the salad dressing).  This location also felt much more cramped than others I've been to. However, I did love the free sample tables they had set up, and the checkout lines moved super fast.  The produce section was top notch, as expected from Whole Foods.  Overall, I'd go back because it's close and convenient... but I'll pass on the salad bar.</text><UserId.>115638333247182158065</UserId.>< response>

< review>
I've used tops since moving back to California a few years ago. This is the best delivery service in town. No matter where you live their drivers are always professionals who get to my place pretty quickly. Never a long wait. Glad to be back in their service area. If you're reading this an and the fence about this is a good service, take the jump and try them out. You won't regret it.<//review>

Tops is the best!

I had not ordered from any cannabis delivery before, and last month I had a pretty significant surgery.

I was in a lot of pain and a friend of mine told me about Tops.

I ordered and they were here within an hour.

Great products and awesome customer service! totally help me recover from my surgery.

I highly recommend Tops!<//Review>

Best delivery services around! Always best quality and a wide range of variety! Staff are personable and friendly! They can also describe products and knowledgeable of what they offer! Deliveries during Covid are safe as well! Ask for specials!<//review>

Needed a delivery service serving south OC about a month ago and decided to try this place. I am pretty glad I did! I have ordered three times since and each time the reps who answer the phone are very responsive, professional and knowledgeable, answering any questions I have. I mainly order cartridges and have found the quality to be very good based on my experience. The drivers are very nice and easy to complete transactions with. Great experiences so far, thanks TOPS!< /review>

I have ordered from many delivery services before and have always been disappointed for paying high prices for low quality flower. Tops Cannabis flower is my go to delivery service because of how clean their product is. Prices are a little high but it’s worth the quality. Quality over quantity should be important to more delivery services out there. The drivers and management are professional and really nice. Don’t hesitate to invest your weed money into quality medicine.</Text>

Always love this company. Deliveries are within reasonable times and they are keeping staff and clients safe when delivering. Keeping distance and wearing masks! Ask for different flavors and products they have a high quality of various items! Highly recommend!</Text>

Jim and the team were beyond helpful, courteous and respectful. They made sure I was completely happy during then whole process. They were extremely knowledgeable regarding my car and what it took to make it perfect. I recommend this shop to anyone looking for quality repairs and especially to Hyundai owners who might need collision work. Here are a few before and after pics to show how amazing they did!!!

These guys are AWESOME from the time I arrived to the time I left.

Bill was very prompt and listened to my needs.  Kirk was   great at going over the repairs.  And Jim was great at providing awesome customer service.

At top of that, the vehicle came out immaculate.  It looked like it was a brand new car.  And I got my car back sooner than I expected.

I highly recommend these people to help you!!!

Thank you so much!!!<//text>

We have used Regal Collision for several years and have always been very pleased as they are detail oriented, always have work completed on or before original estimated date of completion and the quality of work and customer service is second to none.< /review>

2015 Challenger SRT I had damaged the front spoiler and cross mount plastic housing (air scoops to breaks, etc, etc)  They took care of everything (sourcing the parts, doing the repairs).  I had an issue with tire balance, so I brought it back and they took care of it.  I had an issue where I damaged the spoiler again...they took care of it.  Really a great outfit.</Text>

The people are great always friendly with a smile. They take the stress out of all the problems of your car being wrecked. They offered to come and pick up the car from my home. All the paperwork was done and ready for me to sign off on. Thanks for a job well done!!<//Text>

These guys are the best. Helpful is not saying enough. My car came back 2X better than it was before my accident. So beautiful and reasonable too. They didn't miss a thing, and were pretty darn quick. No brainer. This is the place that has my family's  business.</Text>

Parts of my car were discontinued but they did lots of effort putting  the broken pieces together just to look almost same as before. Good job.</review>

I dropped off my car for repair and they kept me updated everyday through text about the process with my car. I was expecting to get my car fixed in 2 weeks. But after a week I received a call that my car was ready for pick up. George even asked me if I need a ride to get there knowing I’m from San Leandro and they’re from Vallejo. When I get there to pick up my car, I noticed that they missed the window so I showed them the scratch caused by the accident. It wasn’t their fault tho. I’ve been to other body shop to get an estimate and they missed the window also. So back to my story, they said that they gonna change the glass and bring it to the tint shop to get it tinted again. And I can come back tomorrow to pick up my car. I asked them if they can tint the other side of my window too and I’ll just pay out of my pocket because it wasn’t included from the accident. So the next day they called that my car is ready. I really loved the outcome! It looks brand new and never been into an accident! They did vacuum inside my car, washed the outside and polished. And for the tint that I asked, George said don’t worry about it. I was so happy and satisfied with their service! Highly recommend 💯⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</Review>

<Review>I have had experienced my unfair number of car wrecks. I had not been to Regal in years.  Jim and the rest of his crew remember me and took my car and fixed it quickly. They made sure it was safe and looking great.Bsck on the road. Regal even handled getting my rental car back to enterprise. Thank-you Regal for another great repair.</Review>< response>

<Text>My friend wanted a fried chicken sandwich and we found Dave's on a Sunday night. I love the menu options and the number of heat levels there are. I got a medium and my friend got a hot tender and extra hot sandwich. The  chicken was really good with the medium having a decent amount of heat to it. There was a short line at the time we went which was much longer when we were leaving but it was definitely worth.< /Text>< Pictures>

One of the most delicious sushi experiences we've ever had. Nestled in between pubs & bike tour shops on Hyde St, this place is a little hidden gem. If we're ever in SF again, we'll definitely visit Grandeho's again!</text>

friendly staff and I love how they are helpful explaining their menu. I was disappointed though on their 'special ramen'. Broth wasn't that special at all and overcooked egg. To be fair, their sushi was amazing.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>A long-time neighborhood gem, Grandeho's is one of those rare places where the food, personal service and ambiance all stand out... Nothing fancy, but the quality of the food always brings us back.  Featuring a variety of Asian food such as fresh sushi, seafood, noodles, etc.  The owner is a local resident and it's obvious this restaurant is a part of her family, and the hospitality always shines through.  Prices are a little on the high side, but the quality of the food is worth it.< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQT6B0MjKXp3Xle-8Fg6A51CCIzNB4IZsjLPk7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOthhfa337SwTyhc6j9YUnX4bzCNolGCU3uEaC0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIbEUzaDjUMLmqRIhVDlFVsXKopMozegZjxtk1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNg9mC6jf0hpyu5vdLh4mlJdIOBfQf26NTtOfzc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1aaMWFapEtpWwK6i3oUSduS-yR-9PBHdtsAtz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvxHvRnJWf1zCTDOAva0XR9BcVNw53fyeP3lk5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiht-vmXRqrSdCFpOSU6sz6chhbf1hefp-uu9F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWu-0cKt_w2CvNp2u0N_csaaFjMBsJHApiOHH9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0ZnG8UcJ1LYSsBJdUR8MMzITOAwxjA9I-nMcq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsBouvDtlZqqcYqSW1Ods-tpOxXStqZX1oLX2J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNb2JjqL3hmZQ6ysFSmtU7Wnr5lEjVLtM05cmMm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNG0aybj0BU0HW8oBNz1lypH_vYIvjehID5FXMd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< resp>

We went there on Saturday around 3 pm. Service was ok. We ordered several rolls. There was a parasite on the Yellow Tail Tuna. We took several pictures. We did not say anything to them and we left after paying. My daughter’s husband is a Sushi Chef and he confirmed it was a parasite. Parasites in fish can make humans really sick. It is unacceptable !!!!< /Text>

<Review>First time here. I've been searching for decent sushi in the area for over a year, and finally I find it. Honestly the best sushi in the city. Great service as well. I had a bento box with salmon skin roll (amazing) and salted mackerel (even better) and veggie egg rolls, also sublime.<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNV6dEPf_M_aQyCMF5lrBZDeSFWJKZA6Z-akL6x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

A true gem in the Wharf district of San Francisco.

My wife and I love to find small local places to dine when we travel, and the hotel concierge suggested this unassuming eatery for "really good sushi".   Grandeho's Kamekyo did not disappoint.  It's not cheap, but the rolls were fresh and service was prompt. Everything we wanted from a casual night out.

There are "hipper" places, and if that's your thing, you might be disappointed.  That's definitely not my thing, though, and it was an easy 2 block walk from our hotel located almost on top of Fisherman's Wharf.

It's worth noting that they do NOT participate in Monterrey Bay Aquarium's "seafood watch" program, so you can get some fish there that are on the "avoid" list.  This is probably no surprise to folks who know about the relationship of the Japanese to Pacific Ocean fishing, but if that's not a problem for you, it was an amazing evening.  If it *is* a problem for you, you can always take the SeaFood Watch app with you and refrain from ordering those items.

Overall, we had a wonderful evening of fresh fish.  I highly recommend a visit if you are in the area and in search of great sushi.< /Review>

There is a sign at the entrance with low size showing you they will charge the tips. Obviously you will read it (if you have very good vision and you focus to these area) when you finish.
Plates are good but prices are high. And, as I said previously, you will get a big surprise when the ticket comes to your table.
I'm sure I'll never come back here.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>This place is a find.  A well-rounded menu that happened to have fatty tuna on special when I went.  Wide selection that makes me want to come back for a lot more. Not far from the tourist trap nearby but the locals dine there.  Catch that classic San Francisco vibe with cable cars going by the door and a glimpse of the Golden Gate Bridge just down the street.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I went here while I was on a choir trip and it was amazing. The service was very kind and welcoming to me and my three friends and treated us better than any sushi place I’ve been to. Our waiter was very friendly and talked to us about our trip. The Philadelphia roll is one of the best I’ve had in a while. Overall it was Ana amazing experience. Next time I am in San Francisco I will definitely be returning.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Well presented restaurant, with helpful friendly service. Prices seemed to be a bit higher than we generally pay around town, but given the location, that's to be expected. On top of the pricing was a fixed 18% gratuity for all parties, regardless of size. Serving sizes were generous, including the rolls. They were well prepared for, and extremely accommodating with young kids, which was a delightful and much appreciated surprise!<//review>

Superfresh sushi made in a delicate way. A bit pricy though but 5 stars for that. But I sat at the bar and I had to hear the sound of 3 different tv screens with different channels (the one at the dinning room, the one at the bar, and the one the cook had one). Not a pleasant experience. The manager should take that into account.<//review>

< Review>
Wonderful little restaurant with very attentive wait staff and chef.  Our waitress made some wonderful recommendations and we left very full and happy.

Fish was all very fresh, with nice size portions and attention was prompt.  My wife and I had our youngest child with us and they took good care of him too.

Prices are what you would expect to pay for this area, and the quality justifies the cost.

We will absolutely be back!</Review>

This place is among the top 5 sushi place I've been to.  The interior is completely Japanese and the service was great.

I sat at the bar and watched the chef sculpt each piece of fish with great care and put thought into aligning every element that was presented.  The place is on the spendy side, so come when you really want to indulge!<//Review>

Probably one of the best sushi restaurants you can find outside of Japan; for that reason, expect a wait! The fish taste very fresh and well chosen. The Uni, was the only item of our choices which could have been better. The Tempora is phenomenal and the Miso Soups (both regular and with mushroom) were delicious.< /text>

<Text>Only okay quality sushi. Prices were a little expensive. We ordered 4 different rolls, the cherry bomb, spider roll, Seattle roll and chef's special roll. The raw fish quality was only so so. Chef's special was a mish mash of raw fish and vegetables garnished with some deep fried vermicelli. Looked kind of like a grade school art project. The flavors were not complimentary.

The restaurant is very interestingly decorated, to say the least. Korean, Japanese, Chinese accents with year round Christmas decor.</Text>< username>

Ordered: the 2 items bento box ($18.95) and the Kimchi Udon ($15.95), both very filling. Nice selection of options to choose from for the bento box, and it came with - salad which was tasty and had fresh fruit bits, white rice and two smaller sides (top left in bento box photo). Prices are a bit expensive, but that's SF for you. Service was great, and staff super friendly.</Review>

Nice, chill place to have dinner with friends. The prices are a bit high, but they give you huge portions. The food is yummy and filling.  Service is not bad; somewhat slow, but they are friendly. Interesting decor, mixed of Christmas deco and random art pieces.< /Review>

The food is solid and the sushi has the potential to be really good. They don't just serve the nigiri as just rice and fish, but go a little beyond by applying sauce and garnishes. Service is good and menu is simple.

The only thing that made me dock a star is their practice of including gratuity for all party sizes and unusually high prices for what you're getting</text>

Great atmosphere, we felt as if we were part of the family. Prices were reasonable given the location. We ordered a boat and weren't disappointed! The fish was sliced quite thick and was very tasty. After dinner we were served a complementary organic fruit plate that was beautifully presented.< /Text>

<Review>Amazing food! They gave us free appetizer (not sure why) of pickles apples and spicy green beans. We had simple sushi, but it was excellent. The servers are very sweet, professional and on top of things. We will be returning every time we are nearby!< /Review>< user_name>

We found this local family owned restaurant by accident at the end of a long day around the city & were pleasantly surprised. Servers were so kind to us and our kids even though I always cringe when taking the 2 year old to any public place. They were helpful and the sushi was excellent! We ordered Won Ton’s & Bento Box for the kids and the Rainbow, Cable Car (amazing!), Dynamite, and Cali roll for the family. All was delivered in appropriate timing giving us time to eat each course and help the kids eat. Atmosphere was great and lots of locals showed up as well so you know it’s a known place considering all the options around town. Prices were very reasonable unlike many of the touristy spots in the area that gouge you for sub par meals and experiences.<//Review>

I would categorise this restaurant: "fusion" rather than Japanese.
I ordered teriyaki salmon, it felt like American salmon steak and gyoza was similar to a Korean styled dumpling.
The impression was interesting, however taste was great!< /review>

It's a little small and slightly pricey, but very good food & service. I recommend the Chef's special and let him create a sushi roll based on your taste preferences.<//review>

Conclusion: Japanese sushi restaurant with a little Chinese flavor.
I was just suspecting it is owned by Chinese when I saw those Chinese calligraphy on the wall, then I saw the cabbage(or Chinese cabbage) on top of ramen, I was 100% sure😑... a little overpriced, tasted Okay though.<//review>

<text>Stayed 2 nights in San Francisco and decided to try this place out on our first night , we liked it so much we came back the 2nd night . They are so incredibly welcoming , the food is so fresh, tried catering to our picky son , and on top of it they have us "on the house* appetizers, soup and salad. Wonderful, food , atmosphere and  people. Please try this place out , I can't say enough good things about it .</text>< pics>

We got the spicy one with extra noodles and couldn't finish, though we kept trying because it was just so tasty. And everyone was sooooo friendly.

When we went, whoever makes half of the advertised specialty drinks was not there, so we could not order them.  We didn't find this out until after we were seated.  Also, they forgot to put the meat in our ramen, and when they brought it out later to fix the issue, the meat was cold.  Finally, the food was just average.  Nothing really to write home about.  We didn't like the taste, but the quality was still okay.  All these things together, though, make it 2/5.</Text>

Good fresh sushi, but the menu prices are a little steep for what you get, likely cause of the location. Menu prices arent the same as the ones posted online, it's a few dollars more per item.< /review>

Casual mom-and-pop sushi place with friendly service and fresh fish. The wife and I ordered Sushi Boat A ($60), which was the perfect amount of sushi for the both of us. Fresh, good quality fish, and the boat had a great mix of rolls v. sushi v. sashimi. They also brought out a few small complimentary side dishes for us (kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumber, etc.) while the sushi was being prepared, which was a welcome surprise. We came at 2PM on a Tuesday and there was only one other table occupied, which made for a nice quiet, peaceful meal. Will come back here next time I'm in the Fisherman's Wharf area!</Review>

The staff at Grandeho's Kamekyo is very kind and attentive. The prices are fair and the food is fresh!
I stopped in to eat dinner on my own and the restaurant wasn't particularly busy but they just started working on a large order for a big party. The server got me started on soup, communicated that it may be a few minutes for my entree, but quickly fulfilled my nigiri order even though the sushi chef was very busy.
The salmon nigiri is a larger portion of salmon than I've been used to and the scallops were amazingly fresh.
I definitely plan to make this a regular stop!< /Text>

Friendly staff and tastey food.  Prices are pricey but the location is good.

Flavor was very good, not too over/under seasoned, fish was very melt in your mouth. Will go again!< /Text>

<review>I busted San FrAn from NY and I am still craving the bowl they served me.The food was pretty good but the reason I’ll give it 5 stars is bc of the service.There were 2 ladies an older (60/70s) and a younger one(around 40s) in which the younger lady treated me like family.The food was really good but the service made the experience well worth it.The food tasted fresh and was a reliever to my stomach after eating so much heavy food for the last couple days.I’m not master of eating with chopsticks so the lady (40s) gave me a training wheels one which was very cool and we got complementary fruits at the end.<//review></record></dataset><record>

The food was ok for the price. We ordered iced tea and never got it. They kept bringing us a ton of small plates with everything we ordered when we already had plates, causing our table to fill up pretty fast. All of our food came at different times, with up to 10 mins between first and last person receiving their food.< /Review>

Wow, I was just in the area and felt like some comforts of Japanese cuisine, walked in and sat at the bar for an amazing omakase (chefs choice) from chef Tran, who displayed a beautiful spread of sashimi and nigiri that tantalized my taste buds. The lovely servers made sure my beer and sake needs were met to the utmost.

All around a 5 Star Japanese cusine experience.

I recommend this hidden gem to any and everyone from this meal on!

The sushi was fine: nothing special. The red snapper was awful. Overcooked, rubbery, barely palatable. The worst part was the waitress insisted that was how it was supposed be since it was pan fried and refused to adjust our bill in any way. Disappointing.<//text>

he sushi was good.
not the best, but good.

the service was lacking.

they raped us on gratuity.

$48 bill = $10 gratuity added in.
total bill= $58

$15 bill = $5 gratuity
total bill = $20

won't go back.
but i had fun with my coworkers!</Review>

We got 2 rolls of sushi--the Cherry Blossom Roll (salmon, cucumber, avocado and tuna) and the Bay Roll (scallop, crab meat, wasabi sauce, salmon and lemon). Both were delicious! I took off the lemon rinds that were on mine but it didn't take away any of the lemon flavor. I loooved the sushi! The chicken teriyaki was good. The tofu teriyaki was, according to my mom, "excellent," and she doesn't use that word to describe food often. My parents also ordered the tofu soup, which they said was good, but we were so full at that point that they could only eat one bite!

My family absolutely loved this restaurant, we ended up going twice! We felt very taken care of and well attended to. We celebrated our parents' anniversary the second time we went and they gave us a super cute fruit plate with little cubes of oranges and a really amazing duck made out of an apple! This place is wonderful and we highly recommend it.<//text>

Sushi is fresh, menu is different than what's on here and price jumped significantly e.g unagi Don is now $25.95 instead of $14.95, deluxe sashimi is now $48 instead of $30<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) I thought I was going to a Korean restaurant and I went to the store and the kimchi that I ate was delicious. I made spicy tofu with spicy but it wasn't spicy at all, but it wasn't traditional Korean food.

여행 중 한식 생각나서 찾아보다 가게 됐는데 직접 담근 김치가 맛있었어요 순두부를 스파이시로 시켰지만 전혀 맵지 않았고 전통 한식맛은 아니지만 재료가 신선하고 많이 들어있어서 좋았어요 회덮밥도 맛있었구요 직원분도 친절하셨어요<//review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Great food & service! Must go if you’re in this area.
It's run by Koreans, so they give you kimchi as a side dish and salmon kimbap as an additional service. The sashimi is also fresh and very friendly. I will have to stop by the next time I come.

한국사람이 운영하는 곳이라 김치 밑반찬 섭스로 주시고 연어김밥도 추가서비스로 주시네요. 회도 신선하고 굉장히 친절합니다. 다음에 오게되면 또 들러야 겠네요.</text>

(Translated by Google) It is a treasure spot that I found while trying to find a restaurant, but I was closed on Sunday because I was so hungry that I was closed on Sunday. I know you're Korean, and you gave me more rice and it was kind and nice. It is also delicious. I was the one who didn't know why I came to the United States to find Korean food, but I was really impressed because I ate rice after eating only flour. Please flourish ~ ^^

원래 맛집 찾으러 가려다 일요일 휴무인거 알고 허탈한 마음으로 배가 너무 고파서 숙소 근처로 알아보다가 발견한 보물같은 곳입니다. 한국인인거 아시고 밥도 더 많이 주시고 넘 친절하고 좋았어요. 맛도 있구요. 미국까지 와서 한국음식 왜 찾는지 모르겠는 1인이 저였는데 느끼한거랑 밀가루만 먹다가 쌀을 먹으니 정말 감동이였습니다. 번성하세요~^^</review>

Amazingly tasting tacos al pastor. They have a salsa bar with lots of options. My favorite has to be the spicey crema sauce.<//text>

Grand opening today! We need another good restaurant in our neighborhood. Please come in and support them while they get going. It has been a long hard road getting through the city permit process, so they have had signs out for months saying. ‘Opening soon’. Well, soon is finally here.< /Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>I was very excited for this place since is down the street from where I live, but I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the food and my drink I purchased. I went in with a friend after I noticed the "Opening soon" sign having been taken down. I bought a Torta de Carne Asada and Horchata drink. First let me began by saying that my torta was extremely dry, and the only thing in it was the carne asada, two tomatoes and some Jalapeños. Hardly anything for the asking price and the bread they use for the torta is not the big round bread that most places use, it was a smaller bread. The Horchata was the most disappointing thing from my order. The Horchata was so watered down that it was hardly sweet, simply put not flavorful at all. I'll be honest with you guys an instant horchata from a package would have had more flavor than the Horchata I drank that day.
The only thing I did like was the girl helping out that day, she was very helpful and nice other than that my food and drink was terrible. Also, they do not sell beer.< /review>< Pictures>

I purchased a recliner and futon sofa from oak furniture liquidators. My experience was awesome! The customer service was above standard and the quality of the products that I purchased was fantastic! Both items were listed at Ashley furniture for considerably more but Oak furniture liquidators gave me the best price possible and in addition , I received an online coupon for another 20% off! I saved over $500 by choosing Oak furniture liquidators and they delivered when I needed it and what I needed at an incredibly reasonable price. Thank you Oak furniture liquidators for the awesome service and the incredible quality and pricing! I will definitely be returning to purchase additional furniture in the future and I’m confident that Oak furniture liquidators will NOT disappoint !<//Text>

My go to place. I purchased a beautiful couch about a month ago. I recently returned to purchase both dresser and nightstand. The staff made my experience pleasant. Highly recommend if you’re looking for reasonably priced furniture. If you’re out there looking to spend your stimulus check-this will be the place to be :-)</Review>

<Review>The staff was very friendly. I wanted the furniture in a darker brown but they didn’t have that color available in the store and I didn’t want to order without seeing it just in case it was ugly.. So, they looked the furniture up, put it on a bigger display which helped me out. They let me browse in peace and answered all the questions I had in detail, they were very knowledgeable about what they were selling.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1605806613581, 'text': 'Lametra, thank you for shopping with us and for your business!

I was pleased because when I shop its usually because I want it right away, I hate going shopping and ask for a product and they say awww, we are out and need to order not sure when we will be getting more.  So for that, I am happy with oak liquidators.  Thank you<//Text>< date>

One of the worst experience I ever have had. Just bought a sofa set from here and when they deliver they forgot to bring the pillows with that, and the driver just left really quickly. When I tried to call them they just rotating the calls, the driver said the store salesman will figure it out and the store person said driver is independent they not responsible for it. So I had to go by my own to pick up my stuff even tho I paid $85 for the delivery.
Just unacceptable stuff.

I meant to write this yesterday, Saturday, after my lovely new bedroom set was delivered and set up on Friday. However sleeping on my new mattress set (closeout from Macy's awesome!) in my wonderful and beautiful new Constellation black bedroom set took up a lot of my time!  The setup was great as Joe did an excellent job despite me sneaking in several times to oh and ah about it and talk his head off.  I ordered this online and unfortunately due to the huge amount of fraud going on in the world today I had to go into the local store and confirm my ID and Credit card. Would love to state that this level of fraud and financial abuse is due to today's problems, that's not true. I worked at Bank of America in the early 1980's when it was only a California bank. Every 6 months we had the newest FBI graduate come in to give us bank tellers the information on the latest frauds usually being perpetrated on the elderly. We bank tellers were the last line of defense before the victim handed over their money to the scam artist. So it behooves all of us to always be careful with our money and for vendors to be sure they are getting their products to a legitimate purchaser.  I really do love the bedroom set and would most definitely purchase more from Oak Furniture in the future. After all there is more of the bedroom set pieces for me to get to round out my remodel and decorating of my master bedroom!<//text>

<Text>They have a huge selection of products available that you can browse through either online or in store on their electronic catalog. Me personally, I like to be able to see and feel the floor model of a bed before purchase but either way I'm very pleased with my purchase. It was quick and easy to order, the sales associate Ruben was very helpful and answered ALL my questions. It took about a week to get the items I ordered. They arrived properly packaged and flawless, which by the way, returns are allowed if the items are damaged, otherwise they are subject to a restocking fee. I have previously purchased a recliner here as a gift and this visit I purchased a bed and an area rug. I definitely will return to purchase again.</Text><date>1584248008364</date>< user_name>

<text>Very prompt & friendly service from Eric. Although I decided against financing, she was easy to work with as well. Delivery was also prompt. It was set up two days after purchase. He came within the first 20 minutes of the 2- hour window, set up my new recliner & mattress and was done within 20 minutes. My entire experience was positive.</text>< Pics>

A few years ago I purchased a couch from them and it’s still in amazing condition! So I went through them to purchase a dual recliner set. Eric Sr. has amazing customer service! He was consistently making sure that all questions were answer and went out of his way to total up different scenarios of the furniture I was looking at. He really hooked it up and gave me a great deal! I’m extremely happy with the customer service and the quality of their furniture!<//text>

Had a really great experience here. The salesman was helpful but not overly attentive and pushy like at other furniture stores. The prices are FANTASTIC, and it's obvious that they have your best interest in mind. I absolutely plan on going back to buy more furniture!<//Text>

My husband and I really enjoy shopping here. Prices are marked clearly and salesmen are always helpful. My family and I choose to  shop with Eric.  I love my new
oatmeal tuffed coaches Eric ordered for me. Purchased both my children's mattresses. Now they carry patio furniture, so I had to buy the new sectional they carry. Eric Lomas is knowledgeable, patient and has provided excellent service. We refer all our friends and family to him.< /review>

The best furniture store hands down! The customer service I received from Eric Lomas was outstanding! He saw my vision and helped me pick out the perfect couch set. I loved my experience so much that I went back to buy my dinning room table set and also some dressers Eric Lomas was there to help me again. I recommend all my family and friends to shop at Oak Liquidators.< /Review>

Very poor customers service. I walked in there, looked at different furnitures, and then walked out without any of the 3 salesmen ask me anything. No greetings, had no one check on me to see if I need any help.< /text>

<text>Had to purchase a loveseat for a family member and needed ASAP.  Eric sr went to check if the one I wanted was available and came back to let me know it was not. I was not sure what I was going to do and really didn't want to go looking for another one somewhere else. Eric checked on a few things and had the whole situation fixed and had me out the door very happily with the loveseat in the back of my truck.
I was so greatful for all his help and would definitely recommended Oak Furniture Liquidators to all my friends and family.  Thanks again Eric sr you saved the day for me.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>It's very Nice inside pool tables in one room. Computers in another room. They serve lunch at noon you have to go ahead of time to sign in and get a ticket. You have to be 60.  But you can get in if your 50. They have coffee and tea bags. A TV  radio dances, a gymn. The only thing that not good is the staff is mean.</review></record></dataset><record>

Great place to pick up local seniors. (I'm kidding, it's a terrible place to pick up seniors) great the city has a good place to keep them, hopefully they stay a while and don't drive themselves there.< /review>

<text>Both the service and the food was excellent. Very filling portions in a truly authentic atmosphere. Many ethic food eateries alter their style and environment to suit the typical uneducated American mentality by providing a less than genuine experience. Taste of Lebanon is true to the culture in all aspects.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>The new owner insists to be too friendly. He insists to shake your hand with his dirty one. He insists to let you listen to his stupid stories. The place is dirty. Flies were flying around, and the food quality is not much.. be aware...</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
The chicken looks like beef. I think they gave me the wrong order and I am too far to take the food back. First of all the chicken swarmma bowl didn't come in an actual bowl, but a sterophome container. The presentation of the said bowl wasn't as appealing as I hope it would be.  Rice, meat and sauce is all I got. The restaurant itself needs an upgrade. And the bread they gave me taste dry.</Review>

<user_name>Maddalena Baker<//user_name><text>Just had lunch here. The owner was very nice and the service was fast. I got the vegetarian plate, which is a great deal - comes out at about $10 after tax and includes a drink. I'm a big fan of Lebanese food - I basically go around trying out different places' vegetarian plates - and while I can't say this place is the absolute best I've ever had in my whole life, it's very good. And that's especially so considering the price.

Tabbouleh was nice and lemony, hummus was creamy, falafel were crispy on the outside and soft inside - basically, everything in order! I particularly liked the tahini dipping sauce - more flavorful than what you get at other places, there's definitely something extra in there although I'm not sure what. The dolmeh was good - but I guess I'm a little spoiled because I'm used to vegetarian plates coming with more than one :)

I also got a spinach pie to go - again, a little spoiled as I'm used to that coming with the vegetarian plate. But now I see why - this place's pies are huge, basically a full meal (comes with tzatziki). It was cooked fresh for me just like the falafel. Nice and lemony filling. They made the pie with the same flatbread that was served with the plate, which I guess gives you a break from phyllo dough if that's what you're used to - and also lets you eat it as a handheld meal if that's what you're after.< /text>< time>

One of the best Best Buy stores I have been. Very organized and tidy. Polite and friendly employees. Unfortunately I didn't catch her name but she went out if her way to find the price match for me, although not successful but I greatly appreciate her effort.</review>

We came in last weekend to buy a portable speaker, and were helped by Nick. The store was quite busy and he was helping multiple guests at the same time. He was so kind and helpful throughout our entire time there, even though he was juggling many tasks. He did an amazing job!< /Text>

< Review>
Best Buy wants an appointment to do anything. I went in with ca$h money and selected the laptop I wanted. When I attempted to purchase said laptop, I was instructed to make an appointment to do so. I had to come back the next day! They must lose so much business this way. Not cool!< /Review>

<Review>No one at this store had any knowledge of the products. I needed a simple usb-c replacement charger for a product sold there. I even showed them the product. Manager of the store was dismissive told me they might sell it online but I’d have to do my own research. Couldn’t believe help me find ANY compatible usb-c charger power/wattage. The only reason I would come to an electronic store now a days is to get help on technical issues like this. If I do the research myself online, I’ll just buy it elsewhere for cheaper.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

All the newest electronic items to help you enjoy any lockdowns & spend that stimulus money!  This store often has a large selection of open box items, some with great prices/huge markdowns (many are nominally reduced, but hey, cheaper is still good.)< /Text>

I had a good experience picking up the new Google Pixel 5 back in October. At first, the employee had a hard time finding the phone I was looking for (store systems showed that they had it in stock). Even when the line of people was getting longer, he didn't give up and searched all over the store until he found it. Most lazy employees would say that the inventory system is inaccurate and would send me on my way, but glad I got an employee that cares about customer satisfaction. Dunno his name, but whoever you are, you're a real one!<//text>

Good service and selection but in a tough area. Security is on the job though so your car should be safe. Online pickup is efficient and courteous. Can get crowded so feel free to go pick up your online order later in the evening ~1 hour before they close.< /Text>

Always helpful here.  Good to check inventory online first though. Their website has many more models in all categories that aren't always available in store.</review>

Easiest curb side pick up. When you purchase an item for pick up, BB will send an email advising it's ready. You park in the parking lot designated for curbside pick up with blue signs with a number. You reply to best buys email with the number of your spot and they send you a 4 digit code. When the BB employee comes out to give you the item, they ask you for the 4 digit code. And that's it. Easy Peasy.<//Review>

The employees are well trained, and knowledgable of their departments. And the security is top of the line making you feel safe from parkinglot, to store and back! Best buy is a great plase to shop in my oppinion.

The store is alright. Didn't have much of a selection on nikon lenses. Biggest problem is that IF YOU HAVE A CAR THATS EVEN CONSIDERED LOW, good luck getting out of the parking lot :)< /text>

Been coming to Best Buy for decades. Staff is always professional and kind.  That said, this rating is for BEST BUY Corp. I asked to simply exchange my space heater that I had less than 2 months. They have a strict policy on returns - no exceptions.</review>

They cool but I went for car audio equipment and they told me they don’t sell that stuff anymore but how can the geek squad install stereo stuff if they don’t have the supplies for the job? It looks nice inside tho but it’s not the same anymore to me.</text>

<review>I've purchased a few items for curbside pick up from this location more than a couple times. Each time they've come out very fast once I've checked in on their app. I also felt very safe because all employees continue wearing masks as they drop off your items. They should be proud of how they've adapted to the times.<//review>< pics>

Every time I put it in online order they cancel within 5 minutes for no parent reason I've called the bank and they said there's nothing wrong on our end so unless you want a lot of frustration I wouldn't order with them and all I was doing was trying to purchase a scooter< /Text>

I bought a tablet on-line and picked it up at the store. Because of the lock down the store was only allowing a few people in the store at a time but was set up to accommodate " no contact" store pick ups. I followed instructions and things went smoothly. Staff was excellent and quick.<//Review>

Covid-19 review: I ordered an item for pickup. After I got notice the item was ready, I went to the store and parked in one of the many available pickup spots. I reported that I had arrived and gave my spot number. After a short wait, someone came out with my item and I had them put it in the trunk. Everything went smoothly.< /Review>

I did an online purchase of a much needed
(had been postponing) microphone. Great price, excellent microphone I got the Blue Ice ball in black. Great microphone and the price was super reasonable.
I did an online purchase and curbside picked up my package. From the app, email or text notification you click the link and it notifes the store you are there to pick up. They verify the code on your phone once they are there and they give you your product.

Super convenient and I didn't have to enter the store!

Also it was available within 2 hours of my purchase for pick which is amazing!</Text><Time>1604598116739</Time><userid>104019518358261401908< /userid></record>

I returned an order in September but STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE REFUND!!!!!!! I have contacted customer service several times and each time they said the refund will be processed in 3-5 business days. Is that the return policy of Best Buy? Holding customers’ money for months??? Will anybody tell me how can I get my money back?< /text>

Might be a bit of hit-or-miss, so I’d recommend not being in too much of a hurry, but I won’t hesitate to use their pickup process again in the future myself.

Original review:

Placed an order for curbside pickup and got a notification that it was ready. Drove over, checked in. Website said to wait 3 minutes. I’ve now been here for 40 minutes and only have seen one car get anything delivered. Not sure what they are doing here, but I’d recommend you go elsewhere. Probably faster to get delivery from Amazon.<//text>< Response>

If you are in need of electronics Best Buy is definitely a way to go!!
I did an online purchase of a much needed
(had been postponing) microphone. Great price, excellent microphone I got the Blue Ice ball in black. Great microphone and the price was super reasonable.
I did an online purchase and curbside picked up my package. From the app, email or text notification you click the link and it notifes the store you are there to pick up. They verify the code on your phone once they are there and they give you your product.

Super convenient and I didn't have to enter the store!

Also it was available within 2 hours of my purchase for pick which is amazing!<//review>

Update: I decided to give them another chance, and the pickup process was much smoother and quicker. Might be a bit of hit-or-miss, so I’d recommend not being in too much of a hurry, but I won’t hesitate to use their pickup process again in the future myself.

Original review:

Placed an order for curbside pickup and got a notification that it was ready. Drove over, checked in. Website said to wait 3 minutes. I’ve now been here for 40 minutes and only have seen one car get anything delivered. Not sure what they are doing here, but I’d recommend you go elsewhere. Probably faster to get delivery from Amazon.< /text>

I returned an order in September but STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE REFUND!!!!!!! I have contacted customer service several times and each time they said the refund will be processed in 3-5 business days. Is that the return policy of Best Buy? Holding customers’ money for months??? Will anybody tell me how can I get my money back?<//Text>

<Review>It's Best Buy. When things go on sale, the prices are competitive. Store is big and clean. Lots of product selection. The location is convenient. The parking lot is huge. Covid curbside works. Supported with a surprisingly good phone support team from corporate and with price matching, it's a good place to get your eyes and hands on products. I don't have anything bad to say.<//Review><Date>1599770833370< /Date>< userid>

The worst absolute store and customer service

My refrigerator after several weeks of wrangling was finally installed

Now I am facing another issue with the stove that I purchased

The same inept, inferior, unprofessional company who hires third rate truckers who barely know how to be kind, empathetic, professional and enthusiastic about their jobs

If you value your health, your sanity, your money, your family, I would definitely go to another company to help you.....

I just purchased a stove from them to use the gift card they gave me because of their admission of fault and guilt from the screw up with their refrigerator....

It is beyond me how Best Buy and pacific sales is still in business.<//review>

Its a best buy so lots of things you may need.   Nice to buy a mixer, a microphone, and a mouse all in one place.  The staff... are trying their best but don't know where everything is and seem to be missing when I need them<//Review>

Selection for what I wanted was not great. Out of stock for what I wanted. Had to go to San Francisco. "It will be ready for pickup in 1.5 hrs." Took 2 DAYS.

Whatever. Got it anyway.<//Text>

Curbside pickup. Waited about 25 min in the car, but the overall experience was good. Email with clear instructions: once arrive at the parking lot, just click thru to the website to notify them where you parked, and they’d bring out the goods to your car. No contact, no need to go into the store.</review>

<review>They aren't helpful at all. Especially the customer service. They don't care about customer's satisfaction. They have strict policy under Covid-19 circumstances and they won't accept return or store credit if you aren't a premium member after 14 days. I'm not confident to do shopping from Best Buy anymore. On the other hand Amazon handles return policy very well. So I can confidently shop from other companies but not again from BestBuy. Good luck to other customers.

BestBuy has a long way to go in this big competition. Not caring about customers' satisfaction will make them lose their customers, then it will lead their gross income.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808f7e2607fb2393:0x3982d3901a2dbc98</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I ordered a pixel 5 online. Then I received an email telling that my order was ready. After a long wait rhey told me that they did not have the color that I ordered. They would refund my money to buy another one, but would have to wait for the refund. They suggested that I pay for another phone of a different color while I wait for a refund
I paid them a little over 700.00 and now, because their error, I would have to pay another 700.00.; That is not my idea of a " best buy".

Absolute worst customer service I have experienced. Whoever was working the customer service desk at 3pm 12/14 - slimmer guy with shaved head and glasses, provided me with horrid service. I purposely purchase electronics at this, my local Best Buy, to support the local economy and jobs during these tough times. However, with customer service this bad, I recommend purchasing elsewhere or online.<//Text>

<review>How these big box stores still exist is fascinating. Came in looking for a lens for my camera and the classic “our system says we have one in stock but I can’t find it anywhere” situation happened. But then they found it! The guy working the the camera department was friendly and super helpful.</review>< Pics>

Helpful staff, although it took a while to get someone who was free. They sorted out a complicated phone return with Verizon on my behalf and even had a Samsung specialist on hand to help me transfer data to my new phone! Good COVID procedures in place.</Review>

tl;dr Lied about stock, never answered phone, endangered my life during pandemic.

Longer version: this store accepted order for apparently in stock router, but never answered the phone confirming stock presence.

I drove two hours to go there and waited two hours in car before being told to go into store during pandemic to check up on the item.

The store was packed with people not properly distancing, yet there was no staff around to help me find the item or to tell people to distance.

After another hour I found out the item was out of stock - they had lied about the stock!< /Review>

Ordered a DJI Spark drone from them online. Well it was ready for local pickup immediately! So I got down there as quick as possible and it was there! No hassles no problems. Staff was VERY HELPFUL. I had a problem with id because I was mugged recently and they stole my wallet. So I brought the new card that I ordered it from, my DMV paperwork saying my license was on the way, some mail and some medication and they were more than fine. Plus they could see my face was swollen and scratched from being mugged 😔. GREAT PLACE, ESPECIALLY THE San Francisco one! 2 thumbs up and 5 stars!< /review>

Even though Best Buy electronic product retailer is not at the time in a full swing of action, it is still SF leader in service of home entertainment products, appliences, and gadgets. It suffered from riot mob invasion, which emptied display items a stock, mainly laptops and gaming computers, also cameras and accessories. While store replenishes  stock, it has split service mode in two parts. There is a line with the social distance to shop for available items. A second line is for ordering items which are not in stock, but could be viewed on display. It is for an assisted tour of the store. The ordered items would be picked up within a day or two. Assistance is cordial and informative. Waiting in line is short, 5 minutes on average. Parking abundant.< /Review>

This Best Buy probably seems more shady than it is. It's quite nice inside and my experience with the sales and store personnel has been nothing short of pleasant. Very helpful staff who are always happy to answer any questions. One of the staff even helped me above and beyond on a Best Buy price match. Will continue to go to this Best Buy as my go-to.</Review>

The website shows the item is available for pick-up tomorrow, but the rep eventually said it will not for over a week. Amazon can ship before the end of the week.

<Review>The experience shop at this best buy is terrible, I would gave 0 star if I can. Will not shop at Bestbuy anymore in the future. I bought an iPad with Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard. And the staff initially brought me a 1st generation Apple Pencil when I asked for 2nd generation one. Then he said no new 2nd generation was available so he gave me an open box one, but at end he entered the price of a new one for an open box (and I didn't find it out because the receipt was so long and he didn't give me the paper receipt and instead said an receipt in email will be send to me). Then I tried to call customer service for a couple times that I need to go back to store (which is a long drive) contact store to resolve this issue. But I cannot connect to the store even I waited for an hour for a couple times:(</Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Bought a LG nanocell90 TV here. Smooth experience. Was surprised to see not so full shelves and 2019 items still on display. Reason being their supply chain affected bad due to COVID19. They are now  prioritizing online orders, store and curb side pickups. If you don't find something, ask a sales person. They have everything in a storeroom somewhere and can get it to you in a couple of days. I guess this location has trucks running Tuesday and Thursday. Always do your research online before going there to avoid picking old items in shelves and reduce exposure to virus hanging in store trying to decide.<//review>< name>

<Review>This Best Buy is hit or miss regarding their service and their stock. None the less its still a Best Buy and you'll still get what you want cause they have that price match stuff and a big stock of gadgets.
This Best Buy gets busy so I think that has effect on their staff not being as helpful, hey they deal with lots of Ken's. The fact they're busy also affects their inventory.<//Review><username>Camila Osorio< /username>< Rating>

A bit pricey.  But there's nothing like handing over cash money and walking out with the product you purchased.<//review>

<Text>Big store! The staff was very helpful when it comes to questions about electronics. We had a good experience with buy and returning our TV. They accepted the return without the box and allowed us to easily exchange for a new one. Will definitely come back for more electronic buys.</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I had bad experiences with the customer service. I tried to purchase a laptop online but my transaction didn't get through, so I call the customer service for help, after they hold me for 30 minutes on call the lady that was assistant me with the purchase couldn't help me and she transferred me to different department claiming that this department can assist me better than her end. Up today I couldn't make the purchase.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<review>How can you not love a store that puts quality and value for its customers above all else? Great prices, almost ANYTHING you need you can find, and good ethics being a large part of the foundation of the company.

<text>My experience with this electronic shop was awesome! They are very professional, knowledgeable and do not break your bank account with high pressured sales. I bought a blender and a Samsung TV three months ago and the quality is very good. I would highly recommend them for all electronic appliance needs.

Made a purchase online and the wrong item was shipped. Visited my local store (SF) and customer service told me that I was out of luck and needed to do a online return. After a few fits of tourists out burst, I called for a manager. Problem solved and I was handed the correct item.

Helpful staff and great convenience towards those like me. I went here to buy a TV and the staff members were helpful enough to show me different brands, selection, and pricing for my needs. I thought a TV was fine but now I got one with quality on it. So far so good the TV still works a month later.< /Review>

My getting anyone to help service me was terrible they treated my niece and myself as if we weren't even there it had taken close to 10 minutes before we gotten any assistance and lost him within 5 minutes I'm looking for him I find him assisting someone else like were our needs not important enough for help ..... So I'm giving three star's because after my niece and I decided to help ourselves with far off better results when we got to the register the that rang up my tv was so pleasant and helpful he made feel better again...

Ordered a DJI Spark drone from them online. Well it was ready for local pickup immediately! So I got down there as quick as possible and it was there! No hassles no problems. Staff was VERY HELPFUL. I had a problem with id because I was mugged recently and they stole my wallet. So I brought the new card that I ordered it from, my DMV paperwork saying my license was on the way, some mail and some medication and they were more than fine. Plus they could see my face was swollen and scratched from being mugged 😔. GREAT PLACE, ESPECIALLY THE San Francisco one! 2 thumbs up and 5 stars!</Text>

<review>Good Location with Spotty Service. While I enjoy going to Best Buy, my experience is always contingent on the service. I do not understand WHY after all these years it takes so long to get someone's attention. However, once you do it is a good experience. Even though I am not a tech novice, I am not an expert either, so I appreciate the helpful staff and they are not condescending.</review>< user_name>

I ordered a computer for delivery. My package was sent to the wrong address. It took over 8 days to get my package because Ontrac had to get approval from Best Buy when I asked for the correction. Their customer at Best Buy was unsympathetic  when I complain to them about the situation.

I even asked for a refund since it was taking so long. I was told I needed to have the item at the store before they could do that. And the wouldn't contact Ontrac to send the computer back to them. It was truly the worst customer service experience that i had in recent memory.</Text>

Standard Best Buy experience. I with the larger corporation would reconsider the customer experience. Incentive structures mean employees are pressured to ask customers for reviews and pitch some upsell, donation, or information request along each step of the checkout process. They could easily cut 5 minutes out of the checkout process which would make both customers and employees happier.< /Text>

Big store! The staff was very helpful when in doubt about electronics. We had a good experience with the purchase and return of our TV that came out defective. They accepted the return without the box and allowed us to easily exchange it for a new one just by presenting the ticket. We will definitely return for more electronic purchases.<//text>

Very friendly and helpful staff. the ONLY downside which almost cost a star was that, and it may have been complete coincidence, they didnt have a great stock of products i was looking for on 2 separate occasions. BUT they also were the only store in the area to have the apple watch i was looking for recently, so they kept the 5 stars.< /review>

Bought a $35 phone case for my Samsung S7 edge that didn't fit properly. When I went back with it, the salesgirl determined someone must've swapped the packaging bc another one we tried fit perfectly. So, I went to Customer Service to exchange it for the *exact* same thing (what's the point when you are entering the exact same sku numbers in the computer anyways?!!) they told me I couldn't swap them out because it wasnt within the allowed 15 day return policy!
So now I have to contact the vendor and deal with it through them?!!! What a waste of my time! You sell me bad inventory and now it's my problem?!! Not cool. Def has ruined my opinion of Best Buy and makes me not want to shop here ever again.< /text>

I love how Best Buys has their curbside pick-up.  It took me around only 5 minutes to get my prepaid order.  The staff are very professional and quick.  Theis is the best store for buying your electronic items.  If you need house hold items like microwaves, computers, eyc. BestBuy is really the best.  I love their Geek Squad.  Very helpful and makes things very clear.<//review>

Very undependable inventory. The website inventory is not in synch with what's on the shelves and I waste a lot of time and experience unnecessary aggravation as a result.< /review>

<review>I did my homework with price matching offer and the manager that was working couldn't lower the price if the device. Could have at least offered a different discount or somekind of savings. I understand the manager cannot over ride price inside computer . Manager was friendly and firm and give him a high-five on that. But would have kept a loyal customer like myself. Store was clean, stocked. Parking lot a bit disray.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Great prices, especially when you get them to match  some place that's cheaper. Just don't expect them to deliver anything heavier than a laptop or anything that needs to go upstairs. I got a great deal on a major appliance after a reorder with a price match and 9 installation snafus. Tenth time lucky six weeks later!<//review>

Staff. Was helpful and despite closing time my sales rep got me the laptop I needed and we had a good chat about device and innovations coming out in the future and I enjoyed the conversation and recomend bestbuy openbox products. Uou can get an outstanding deal for a huge savings on some excellent products that are essentially new. CHEERS!< /review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>Just your typical Best Buy - a huge space full of tons of gadgets.
I do like how they have separate sections for the different phone companies & for Apple products and Windows products.
They also have a good selection of household appliances. (We purchased a vacuum cleaner from them because they actually had a bigger selection than the Bed, Bath & Beyond a couple of blocks away.)
Parking can be a hassle, but there are always off-duty SFPD officers on-site patrolling the area.< /review>< pics>

it's a nice big store and they have lots of selection of items it's also really close to Costco and Office Max in a bunch of other things I was kind of taken back by all the RV is parked outside it's not really too much of a bother as a newcomer to San Francisco it's a little bit weird seeing that</text>

<review>The place is full of locks and lacking employees to help customers. Had to wait like 20 minutes while I could find someone available to help and when I did he had a bad attitude (including the cashier). Also a lot of the employees don't want to move out of their area and it's a problem because none of their stuff is self service. Definitely wouldn't go again if I didn't have to, prefer online.</review><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808f7e2607fb2393:0x3982d3901a2dbc98</GmapID><name>Eugenio Rodriguez</name></record></dataset><record>

There store is nice with a good collection of products. Staff is friendly and helpful. My only complaint  is regarding the computer system at the cash counter. Firstly, the system didn't show a promotion which was available on the website. Next, the computer couldn't look up my account and kept hanging while processing my order. However, the staff were really helpful and patient and helped me get the promotion offer!<//review>

I came by multiple times since I bought the “insurance” for my laptop. They didn’t fix it, and the wait was brutal. Every time I came it, Geek Tech took 6 hours or more. They also turned off my find my device but didn’t tell me.</Review>

I purchased online and picked up in store. However this was a huge mistake. It took about 15 minutes for the employee(s) to find my item. Would have been much quicker to just have bought the old fashioned way.</text>

<Text>The product selection was good enough
However, the service did not make me happy. We had questions about the product, so we asked one of the Best Buy staffs ( not remember his name ). He was extremely rude. Unfortunately, we have met him twice. His rudeness did not change at all.< /Text>< pictures>

At one point Best Buy suggested I bring my one year old $2200 wall oven into my nearest Best Buy store to see what the problem is. 1/2 hour on hold to best buy, who would not talk to me because not yet one year old, told me to cal pacific sales who also won't help me and told me to call best buy back.</Text><date>1562608846632< /date></record></dataset><record>

Best Buy is a great place to order online and do store pick up. It can take a minute so order ahead of time and not when you’re rushed otherwise you’re going to be waiting .  The staff at magnolia are great so if you’re wondering about that see a sales associate< /text>

< Review>
Employees are nice and helpful,  but the manager is incredibly rude. We forgot to add my name to a pickup order. Our fault. An employee kindly asked her if there was something that could be done. Unprompted by me, and with the WORST of attitudes she asked me to move and step out of the line. I hadn't even asked her anything! I told her I wasn't asking for anything and that she could be more polite. She turned around and left.</Review>

<review>A 15 day return policy??? How does this company still stay in business. The likes of Amazon will run it into the ground. And this was an online order so it took 10 days alone to ship. Makes no sense and the manager was not helpful at all.< /review>< Pics>

<review>Great service and selection. Really friendly people. I had to hang around for a bit testing some new equipment and learned a whole lot from just chatting with the super-informed computer team.  It's worth coming out here if you like Best Buy, but don't always get good service. This is a great team.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x808f7e2607fb2393:0x3982d3901a2dbc98< /GmapID></record>

Helpful sales people and competitive pricing keep me coming back.
I am a frequent shopper on Amazon, but will stop by this Best Buy and check out new stuff in person.  I have had good experiences in the Home Theater, Appliance, and camera departments.  I have been pleased with the customer service and knowledge that has become rare in most retail stores.  The promotions have been fairly aggressive and I have bought quite a few items here.  A few times I stopped by to pick up a small accessory expecting to have them match an Amazon price, only to find the Best Buy price to be lower.  I admit to loving online shopping, but still enjoy the instant gratification of a local store.<//text>

<text>If you enjoy techgear you'll love Best Buy.
Huge selection of items, helpful employees and clean store.  I believe that chain stores were invented so that you always come back to get what you liked no matter where you are.  So chain store reviews will not differ a lot from one branch to the other.  Computers, TVs and cashier will always be located in the same spot.
We the human beings make the difference.
In this visit I asked for a computer power supply.  The person helping me never asked if it was for desktop computer or notebook so he ended up providing the wrong directions.  Nothing serious. Then I went to the store pickup line to grab something I ordered online.  The person assisting customers there was not good at all 👎.</text>< Pics>

Very large store with good service from what I encountered. The staff didn't seem particularly happy to be there, but that didn't affect my experience. I was there on back-to-back days, and the buying experience was helpful and pleasant. The second day I had to return the product, and the process was fast and easy. I would definitely go back.</review>

They went above and beyond and saved me money. I walked into the store as it opened and was fixed on my target purchase. I needed to replace my Bluetooth and was looking for the best price to replace the previous one I had bought several months ago. An employee approached me and asked can I help find what your looking for. I started to tell him that's OK but instead just told him what I was looking for. I also indicate that the replacement paid went up a lot since I bought them last as they weren't on sale this time around. He then did something really cool in asking me if I had purchased the insurance plan. I told him I couldn't remember and doubted it. He said no harm in checking and I'm Glad I accepted his help cause I had bought  the insurance. The insurance plus the price difference from another store for the same item saved me sixty dollars. Thanks for the excellent customer service.<//review>

Wanted to come buy Oculus Go. You'd think they'd want my money. The security guy yelled that they were closed, though it was 10 mins to 6. If you close before 6 -- mb update your "open hours"?
I guess I'll order online.< /Review>

I like the customer service like everything else in the country. There were a lot of stuff that were not available and they had to order online first. It would not work for us since we were flying the next day. But the customer service representative was helpful enough to give us alternatives. I still give this store 5 stars even though their store did not have everything I need because I understand that most things are online mow.</text>

<Name>Tom Steele</Name><time>1539247992947</time><Rate>1</Rate><review>My latest visit to this location was awful!
I went to buy a new computer - and had some specific questions.
So I roamed around that section looking at their offerings, and waiting for a chance to get some assistance from one of their sales associates.  But none of them paid any attention to me.  No eye contact, no scanning around to see who might be waiting to talk to them next.  Meanwhile they each spent very extensive periods of time with other customers.   Then they randomly engaged with other customers who came into that area well after me.  They seemed oblivious that I was even there, like maybe I was invisible.  At one point two associates spent a long time trying to persuade a customer to buy into some weird BB purchase club deal, while I stood right by watching them.  It was so weird!   And simply displayed a very poor awareness of how to juggle their time to best serve all customers, with some fair priority for who is next.
After 90 minutes I basically had to raise my assertiveness to get attention from one associate - who more-or-less answered my questions quite quickly, but was also very dismissive of a question I asked - as if I was asking something dumb, and he seemed quite impatient to spend any additional time with me, despite having just spent an hour with another customer.
Needless to say it was a negative experience and so I didn't buying anything.< /review>< pictures>

The associates are useless. Can't even tell where to find basic items. Not to mention if you ask a technical question about a product - good luck with that. I don't see why they hire these folks. Anyhow, I think we all go to best buy because we can't wait two days for Amazon to ship it. One star for price matching.<//text>

Pretty good selection and not a bad store IF you find someone willing to help you. Usually the employees aren't very helpful and you have to chase one down if you want assistance.< /review>

It doesn't get too busy. Staff is very excited, they do seem busy most of the time trying to stock something or helping customers. However if you go and ask for help, they're either quick to help you, or send someone quickly who is knowledgeable about specific department. They are not afraid to suggest things which can be found online at Best buy or other online retailer. One of the employee who helped me was pretty patient and walked me and my friend through all the options they had and explained the difference between them. As well he told us about other options that could be found at other retailer and reason on why best buy doesn't carry them. Will definitely go here in future.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

First time buying a major electronic thing (TV) at a physical store in the past decade. Reasonably easy, staff were helpful, info they gave was mostly accurate. (Shout out to CJ, very patient and friendly) They don't work on commission so pressure was low.< /Text>

Very nice and helpful staff. Geek squad tends to be a line but they always do their best to take care of our issues thoroughly. There are plenty of products to spend awhile on figuring out if you like them. Nice size location, you never feel crowded by other customers. Overall a good place to shop, especially if you have a best buy card, and can buy a lot of cool stuff for the home :)< /Text>

Interesting that each department had it's own check out line w/ runners.
Only a few registers were able to process the application for their credit card. Our cashier had to use the 5th register to help us apply. Then took us back to her Dept to ring up the sale.<//text>

Every time you open the Best Buy application, the guaranteed price match comes out and when you go to the store they try to say no in that on that page we have not mach with Google that is another code since it is the same product they try to avoid matching any price  with any silly excuse and it is the only one that does it I do not know why and I thought that nothing else in tanforan but also in San Francisco everyone does not know if it is their politics I do not know but they are the only ones who do it.<//review>

<text>Best Buy is usually my go to place for electronics. The wide variety of electronics they carry supports most brands in the United States. The only knock I give Best Buy is that everyone working in the store will walk up to you and ask you if you need help before you leave the store. I understand it is to deter theft but it gets annoying after you have told 3+ workers you don't need any help.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

< Review>
Please do not shop at Best Buy for appliances. We experienced the worst service of our lifetime with them. We had a refrigerator under warranty die after 11/2 years. They had to replace.
This was Mid October. After EIGHT (8) ATTEMPTS at Delivery it was finally delivered the day after Christmas. Have never seen a more disorganized company. Here is a small sampling of some of the interactions.
10/30/2019 Got a call back from BB on 10.30 saying schedule was for Saturday 7-1
10/30/2019 Got another call back from BB  saying schedule was for Friday 7-1 (reminded her to send a 4 man crew)
10/30/2019 My husband called best buy to verify 4 man crew spoke with BB she had a 3 man crew in notes (he reminded her to send a 4 man crew)
10/31/2019 4:34 pm BBcalled said she had emailed the manager to verify 4 man crew. She had not heard back from the manager of the delivery team at 4:34 had not heard back.
Time scheduled for 10:30-12:30 Friday. Did not deliver
11/3 On Sunday Husband called no delivery possible before Saturday. We are gone! Scheduled for the 26th. when we return.
November 3 On Sunday Husband called no delivery possible before Saturday. We are gone! Scheduled for the 26th. when we return.
On November 26th,  This is the fifth TIME Delivery guy said he thought we should get a discount.
Delivery scheduled for December 11, canceled because they could not manage to get a 4 man crew. It has now been 2 months and 6 attempts at delivery .
Delivery scheduled for December 18, canceled because they could not manage to get a 4 man crew. 7th attempt
December 26, it was finally delivered. TWO MEN brought it upstairs, not 4.< /Review>

<Review>We couldn't find what we were looking for. Staff was friendly but not accommodating.

<Review>Pros: Well stocked, staff is extremely helpful, service is fast, plenty of parking, good location, close to other stores that we frequent (Costco, Trader Joe's, etc) and returns are hassle-free.  And BTW, there is a good food truck on the street, and a food truck compound across the street.

Cons: I can't really think of anything big.  Oh, they did recently close access to the parking lot from Treat Street and there is no pedestrian access from Treat Street either.  It's a minor inconvenience for us.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< gmapID>

Had great service while choosing a cell phone. There was a large selection of cell phones to choose from which was a little daunting, but with the assistance from an employee who gave me the amount of time I needed to decide without any up-sale or intimidation, I purchased the perfect phone at a great price.< /Review>

I ordered a cell phone on line and had the option for store pick up.
I drove maybe 15 minutes to the nearest Best Buy and when I got there?? My order was processed and ready for pick up! That was super fast and quite efficient. I was impressed.< /Text>

It's great that they will meet or beat Amazon prices.  I got a great deal on my lap-top. Other than that, just a well-stocked big-box electronics store.< /text>

I browsed around for a deal on another laptop (prices aren't spectacular...even on sale items) but am always keeping my eyes open just in case. Otherwise, I'll end up going over to Costco, where there are better deals usually.</Text>< username>

The last Best Buy in San Francisco!!! The staff here are excellent. Whenever I come in they answer my questions, if they don’t know they ask a colleague, the geek squad are friendly and helpful. I hate big box retailers. I love this store.</review>

It's great because it's decently close, has parking, and good for last minute electronics purchases.

Though you usually have to seek out help and sometimes stockers will ignore you entirely.<//Review>

Great electronics store with a variety of goods which match different budgets. The Geek squad is also based here and offers repair services for Apple products but on appointment.

Customer service here is excellent and the gadgets are of great quality.< /review>

Super busy so you have to enter a queue to get help in the mobile section. Many display phones were not charged so you couldn't interact with them, which is half of the reason I come into Best Buy for phones. Also they have a ton of iPhone cases but very few cases for any other phone.< /text>

The only Best Buy in San Francisco. The location is right off of the 101/280 highway, though a series of turns must be taken due to the numerous one-ways. The park lot is decently sized, just large enough for black friday crowds. Online order and pick-up available. Taco truck outside on most days. Other than that, typical Best Buy electronic super department.<//review>

<Text>It's what you would expect in a Best Buy. Layout is fairly similar to most, although since it's in the city, the aisles may be a little narrower. Parking can get crowded during holiday season, so be prepared to stalk drivers. Staff is mostly knowledgeable about products. Return process is easy and had a dedicated line.</Text>< Pictures>

Bought replacement propellers for my drone and when I opened the box they were already heavily scratched. Went back and asked for new propellers. They didn’t have any more. Asked for a discount and they were gracious enough to give me 10% thank you so much BestBuy for selling me a USED product full price. Customer service was nice which is why I gave them two stars.< /review>

It should had been a smooth in and out buy, as I move into the cashier's, an employee said to me "he's ready sir" so I moved in and saw two cashiers, one was on his phone completely distracted so I moved in at the other cashier whom just had finished with another customer, as soon as I came closer, he just took off and left me unattended, sometimes one thinks how easy it can be just to grab an article, pay for it and leave but some people just work for the money and not to really do a good and decent job.<//text>

Wasted 20 dollars to get too and from the store to find out I had the wrong product because their employees are obviously untrained and uneducated about their own store. Management was unhelpful and just awful in general. If you have ANY other option I highly recommend you take it before wasting more money on people who don’t have a problem wasting YOUR money through sheer laziness.< /Text>

Staff was knowledgeable, and prices can be good.

However, probably common to other people who work in similar stores, they tend to want you to buy more than you budgeted for.

I understand the concept of buying beyond your needs to be future proof, but in technology, there really is no such thing as future proof, and it may actually be cheaper to buy one system now and another when it's time to replace it than to buy one that is supposed to be future-proof.

Instead, I think it would have been better to recommend the most suitable system within the consumer's budget, than to recommend more powerful machines that cost hundreds/thousands more. (I.e. Choose a better processor, SSD, RAM, and/or graphics adapter, but not all, for similar prices)

If you can't utilize the extra power, it's just money (and extra electricity) wasted.

But overall, they have a good selection, and while the wait for available staff can be long, they are quite friendly.<//text>

I’ll keep this short and simple so that people can have their own opinion about this place. 5 stars for its customer service, 5 stars for its prices, 5 stars for its overall friendliness as well as products.

I shop at Best Buy a lot. They have just about everything I need. A little bit about myself: I am a very tech savvy person. I want everything to be the latest or have a modern technology and BEST BUY DOES A GREAT JOB OF THAT. All of the electronics are also great quality and won’t or be damaged easily.

5 stars in GENERAL. LOVE THIS PLACE, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO. EVERYONE WHO’S TECH SAVVY OR JUST WANT  TO EXPLORE THE UNLIMITED BOUNDARIES OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL WORLD.< /review>

Not many options. Difficult to find someone to help you out with questions. Otherwise fine. You will need some time before you find someone helpful out there. Better to buy online.< /text>

The store looked like it had just been looted.  There were boxes and piles of merch to buy at fairly decent prices. I went in to consult with tech support who was of no use at all.  They seem to have a lot of mid-range products and a fair variety of brand name products. Tech specs of products and the knowledge of salespeople were limited at best. Be aware of zealous salespeople who will try and pull you into a high end product that you later regret .<//text>

<Text>Very large and eclectic array of merchandise from hardware, carpentry and glass-cutting services; through Do-It-Yourself advice and materials; to housewares, holiday and gay themed wares, including costumes and decorations.
Most of the staff are very knowledgeable and offer assistance as they circulate on the floor; however, I've encountered curt, dismissive to sarcastic remarks and disgruntled attitudes several times- especially when returning merchandise the manager has been frosty and disapproving. That despite sales persons stating store policy as, "if it doesn't fit your needs (as in model, size, shape, color...whatever), you're welcome to bring it back!"<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

This review is for the extra coverage I purchased for a Sony Bravia TV couple years back. I bought this TV from Magnolia in Best Buy and they suggested that I purchase extra warranty because it was an expensive TV and I thought, better not worry about breaking and I purchased it. I can't exactly remember how much i paid for the warranty, but my guess is around 200-300 USD.

I still like the Sony TV but the issue was the remote that broke. TV came with two remotes. One regular remote and one that has a microphone in it that made searches very easy.

After the remote breaking, i went to the best buy store thinking they would help me replace it. Once they realized I wasn't there to buy something, i was quickly dismissed and was told to call their support and deal with them. I left the store annoyed but it wasn't a big deal. I called and spoke with a person on phone and they said they would ship it to the store only(Can't ship it to my house). Once it arrives, they were to give me a call.(promising right?).

Well that call never came and I gave up for a while.

Recently the second remote broke and I went in the store again and told the guy there about the story. He wasn't pleased to help but he tried anyway. He said that my remote was here but I never picked it up. I explained that I wasn't called and I surely wasn't going to best buy to check if my remote arrived.
He wasn't pleased with my answer and he kept looking down at the computer. I'd like to remind you that my external warranty hasn't expired yet I'm treated like I'm bothering these people over a remote.

After looking at the computer for a while, he told me that he doesn't know where the remote is and he's going to have to search the warehouse(?) He offered to give me a call if he finds it.

I was very frustrated at this point and I asked him how he thinks I should change channels and gave me the used remote they have in the store they use to change channels.

I was done at that point, I took the remote and left.

Never again.< /text>

<text>This is very good place to buy electronic items. The staff is very helpful and they will help you to select the best item for you.

When I asked about an international warranty, the sales representative clearly explained.

There is large parking area.< /text><Date>1521625045024< /Date><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I order a 40 inch samsung tv online  around noon. it saying it would be ready to pick up in one hour in the store of San Francisco. I went to there to try to pick it up at around 3:30pm.  However, my item  wasn't ready. the staff at the pick up section let me waite for few minutes. I waited for 20 minutes while the staffs  weres not busy. also I saw more than ten tv that were same model as I order on the floor.  It was faster to get it myself.< /Text>

Beware of 15 Day return policy, I was burned on defective merchandise.   Both in store and online customer service was unable and unwilling to help.   Amazon has better prices and an effective 60 day return policy with no questions asked.< /text>

The store looked like it had just been looted.  There were boxes and piles of merch to buy at fairly decent prices. I went in to consult with tech support who was of no use at all.  They seem to have a lot of mid-range products and a fair variety of brand name products. Tech specs of products and the knowledge of salespeople were limited at best. Be aware of zealous salespeople who will try and pull you into a high end product that you later regret .</text>

Very large and eclectic array of merchandise from hardware, carpentry and glass-cutting services; through Do-It-Yourself advice and materials; to housewares, holiday and gay themed wares, including costumes and decorations.
Most of the staff are very knowledgeable and offer assistance as they circulate on the floor; however, I've encountered curt, dismissive to sarcastic remarks and disgruntled attitudes several times- especially when returning merchandise the manager has been frosty and disapproving. That despite sales persons stating store policy as, "if it doesn't fit your needs (as in model, size, shape, color...whatever), you're welcome to bring it back!"</Review>

GOOD DEALS, but return policy is pathetic. If you are buying online just be 100% sure because you cannot cancel or change the order after half an hour. If you dont like what you bought and want to return the product either you have to walk all the way to Best but brick and mortar or have to pay for return shipments. Happy shopping.<//text>

Disappointed with the customer service, staff is very rude and unfriendly, very poor management, especially the staff at the phone section and home appliances section are very rude . The most of the staff gather at one place and chitchat with their fellow coworkers and  don’t care about the customers, we don’t expect a lot but just a smile and maybe ‘ can help you find something ‘ would be nice but nothing comes from them.wonder if there is any management there who can look in to this matter seriously . The restrooms were horrible too... disgusting place to shop and customers should think twice people spending their hard earned penny on such places.</review>

Although I detest browsing in this Best Buy on Harrison Street in San Francisco, due to the lack of service to older customers by indifferent teenage sales clerks, the store happens to be the most convenient Best Buy to where I live. Truth be told, I much prefer the ambience and service of the Best Buy at Geary & Masonic.

I'm elevating my rating of this place to 3-stars for one reason only. When you purchase an item online, and provided the Harrison Street outlet has it in stock, you can go within a few hours to the online pickup desk, adjacent to the checkout counter, and pick up your order, without having to deal with the surly sales clerks.< /Review>

0 stars would be more fitting.  Ive visited this place 3 times in the last month.  Each time had been a huge disappointment.  Customer service SUCKS.
Today,  I returned a laptop that I've had for less than a month.  The keys stick.  The guy gave me a hard time and asked if i returned it before?  He had already checked the serial number on it and it matched.  He had attitude, which I didn't appreciate.  The 1st time I came in was to purchase that damn laptop.  The guy sold me the laptop and a program that couldn't be loaded on it.
Don't be visiting this location anymore.<//review>

Best Buy sold me Microsoft Office key that had already been redeemed. When I received the card it had been scratched and I couldn't use the key, it's said that the key was redeemed with a different Microsoft account. I called Best Buy yesterday and after being transferred from one department to another for 40 minutes I was assured that the let Microsoft know, I needed to create a new account and use the key. The Key still doesn't work! I bought items for over $1 500 and selling used keys is unacceptable, not mentioning the time that I wasted on calling Best Buy and explaining what happened over and over again. Do something about it and give me a new key that works!</Text>

The most of the staff gather at one place and chitchat with their fellow coworkers and  don’t care about the customers, we don’t expect a lot but just a smile and maybe ‘ can help you find something ‘ would be nice but nothing comes from them.wonder if there is any management there who can look in to this matter seriously . The restrooms were horrible too... disgusting place to shop and customers should think twice people spending their hard earned penny on such places.<//review>

Best selection of electronics in the city.  Prices are comprable with Amazon for the most part. Staff can be knowledgeable if you go in with some knowledge of the products you are interested in, price point and what you want most. Service isn't quick or as friendly as it could be. They are usually quite busy.<//text>

0 stars would be more fitting.  Ive visited this place 3 times in the last month.  Each time had been a huge disappointment.  Customer service SUCKS.
Today,  I returned a laptop that I've had for less than a month.  The keys stick.  The guy gave me a hard time and asked if i returned it before?  He had already checked the serial number on it and it matched.  He had attitude, which I didn't appreciate.  The 1st time I came in was to purchase that damn laptop.  The guy sold me the laptop and a program that couldn't be loaded on it.
Don't be visiting this location anymore.< /review>

Great selection & nice staff.  They gave me a price match on my printer on an item with different numbers .  I saw on the manual they were the same items.  Saved $30!  Great helpful managers & floor staff.  They got my sale!  I had problems with the magnolia staff years back, but I was told they no longer work there.  Good parking.<//review>

Heater was too hot in the store and the customer service was horrible and worst Best Buy experience ever. Both times I went. They said what i bought wouldn't be available for over two weeks and the sane day I was told to come back that they had it and had to make two trips. Very inconvenient. No one would help and I asked several service reps. No desire to ever return to this store again but to return this item because the demo rep was awful, not helpful or knowledgeable.< /review>

Excellent parking and very walk able from the local transport. The service was excellent behind the counter and they tried to price match the item I brought. At least they tried and I accept the honesty from behind the counter.

The store where you go in looking for help on those tough technical problems you can't solve and yet help is no where to be found. Although, this store is usually amply staffed except for the occasional weekend when no one can seem to get help. And even when you do find someone who is willing to help they don't know what they're talking about most of the time. I may be referring to all customer service now-a-days, but this Best Buy in particular could use a little help in the hiring department.

At the end of the day I still need my essentials and I usually find them here.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>The staff attempt to be helpful as per their presumed training standards however, more often than not my questions go unanswered. The management needs to empower the employees by placing more information at their disposal so when a question is above what they were provided or have gathered on their own, they have easily accessible information at their disposal. In many cases I end up increasing their knowledge in whatever area of the store they are assigned to occupy space in, although on more than one occasion I have gone home with products that are either incorrect, incompatible, or incomplete. Their return policies leave much to be desired...< /Review>< Pics>

Pathetic customer service.
My Dad visiting from India needed to replace his phone which died suddenly. We indicated to the salesperson we were looking to get a Galaxy S9.
The salesperson was interested in closing the sale as soon as possible with minimum effort on his end, and could not even answer basic questions about what new features this model had. There was an obvious reluctance to even show a working model of the phone and upon doing so, a pressure to immediately bill and close the sale. Yet to see a salesperson that disinterested in his job :(
I've been to many Best Buy's across Atlanta and other parts of California and never had such a disappointing experience. I will not be returning to this location again. The quality of customer service is abysmal.<//text>

< review>
Although I detest browsing in this Best Buy on Harrison Street in San Francisco, due to the lack of service to older customers by indifferent teenage sales clerks, the store happens to be the most convenient Best Buy to where I live. Truth be told, I much prefer the ambience and service of the Best Buy at Geary & Masonic.

I'm elevating my rating of this place to 3-stars for one reason only. When you purchase an item online, and provided the Harrison Street outlet has it in stock, you can go within a few hours to the online pickup desk, adjacent to the checkout counter, and pick up your order, without having to deal with the surly sales clerks.< /review>

Now the only best buy in the city so forced to go there for electronic needs.  The store seems a bit depressing from the dates decor and drab lighting.</text>

I shopped from Best Buy before but the staff member whom I encountered in this particular one was rude. I went there to buy a MacBook, but I had no plan to take an Apple Care. I appreciate his good intention to help me secure my laptop, but insistence is not the best option to convince a customer. Over that when I asked for some extra time to figure out the card I want to use to make the payment, so that I receive purchase protection, his grumpy attitude made me feel guilty and ultimately he sent his colleague to complete the sale. Not the nicest experience.</Text>

The staff are very knowledgeable in their respective fields but occasionally you will see a group of several employees chatting amongst themselves which can desuade customers from approaching with questions. Otherwise Best buy is a great place to shop, especially if you have a last minute gift or need to get parts for any electronics equipment. Since this is the only Best buy left in San Francisco (they closed the one on Masonic) the next closest would be east Bay or redwood City.</Review>

The security staff is always on high alert to deter shoplifters, it's an uneasy feeling even if you're just a regular shopper that came from the register with a receipt in hand. BB is already selling their stuff at a premium price over other electronic outlets, unless you really need something urgently, consider alternative purchase options from Amazon or eBay.</review>

Unimpressed. Your usual Best Buy standard affair. 3 out of 5 because that's just it, same old same old. I show up I shop I buy then leave. No exceptional customer service, nothing to provoke an after thought. Again Unimpressed.<//Review>

This is like a flagship store. It's a lot bigger than your typical Best Buy and they have a lot of cool displays for their products. Parking is easy and free which is saying a lot for this city. They have armed guards which either is concerning or a good thing.< /text>

<Review>This place has more things than I expected.  Old media like CD-RW discs and older cables.  It wasn't super cheap, but I need it, so it's great that they carry it.  Computer guys were pretty knowledgeable about what they sold too, that's better than a lot of other best buys.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808f7e2607fb2393:0x3982d3901a2dbc98< /gmap_id></record>

Got home and saw a lower price on the Best Buy website within an hour of purchase.  No adjustment without actually disconnecting the keyboard,/mouse and driving back 30 minutes to the store and going through the sales process all over again.  They have my account # and could just give me a $7.50 credit.  Not worth the trip but not a happy customer.<//Text>< Pictures>

Busy store with good prices and wide selection although sometimes the shelf space will be empty if the product is on sale. Finding a non busy floor worker can sometimes be frustrating. Overall not a bad store.< /text>

<text>Got a great deal on a floor display freezer, didn't have to wait for it to come in next week, because I needed it today. My old one stopped working well. Just hope this new one will last at least half as long as the old one. The old one was manufactured in 1997. Got the three year warrantee just in case, even with it the cost was only about half the price of a new one.</text>< user_name>

Instead of organizing by category, they have brand boutiques for the bigger brands. Meaning that while the Samsung guys are signing up phone accounts for an hour at a time, you can't get an answer about a tablet, Chromebook or laptop. It also means it's impossible to compare products in the same category.And products from minor brands are hidden behind pillars halfway across the floor. It used to be so much easier !<//text><name>Ellen A</name>< Response>

How is it they sell phones however almost no way to protect it upon leaving the store? I use a Samsung GS 10+, a new phone and Best Buy had exactly 3 cases and no screen protectors, zip. On the other hand had I been an iPhone user there had to be 745,000 options for those customers. I've nothing against   iPhones or Apple I use a Crapple MBP! But I don't make phone calls with that thing and would appreciate it if best buy wouldn't descriminate against non iPhone users. Or change their name to Best Buy for Crapple!!!! Yay lol!!!</Review>

Absolute worst service I've ever had in a store. The employees laughed at me when I asked questions and then decided to tell me random false facts about a product. I wouldn't recommend this store, hopefully they get better soon.</text>

The Samsung kiosk was represented to me as a next step for getting technical support after incompetent phone and chat agents. It turned out that they're just a sales kiosk, so I ended up wasting several hours on making a trip and waiting for the rep to try all the useless things other agents had already tried. I can't believe brick and mortar stores are still a thing.< /review>

This store has some of the best customer service I have ever experienced. I came in because I was having issues with a laptop not turning on and I couldn't determine if the issue was with my laptop or the charger (it's the charger). The Geek Squad guy looked to see if they had appropriate extra parts for me, and an employee towards the back of the store allowed me to try plugging my computer into the charger that was at the chromebook station to determine that the laptop would indeed accept a charge (another employee helped me locate an appropriately similar model). Overall a great experience and I will be back.< /Review>

<Review>The staff are very knowledgeable in their respective fields but occasionally you will see a group of several employees chatting amongst themselves which can desuade customers from approaching with questions. Otherwise Best buy is a great place to shop, especially if you have a last minute gift or need to get parts for any electronics equipment. Since this is the only Best buy left in San Francisco (they closed the one on Masonic) the next closest would be east Bay or redwood City.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<text>I miss the days of "Good Guys", Best Buy comes in a second close.  They have a lot of electronic goods and accessories to go with it.  It does take time to walk around to look for what you need.  If you're in a rush ask a sales associate.  I also like that many of the items you can test out in the store before your final purchase.  If you're returning items, make sure you check in at the door before entering the store.  They need to tag the returns.</text>< Pics>

DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE.  They are AWFUL.  The worst.  I will report them to better business.  I had a 8-12 delivery window.  They never came, no phone call.  Set up another 8-12 window, and at 1, I am still trying to track them down.  The business should be shut down.  Avoid at all costs.</text>

Because it was pasted the return date (Jan 14th and it was the 23rd) I somewhat understood but asked if I could speak to the manager. The employee laughed at my wife and I and actually made faces behind the manager and she also rejected us. We were trying to spend more money in the Harrison street location in San Francisco... We walked out swearing to never shop at Best Buy again based on how we’re treated. He even made the comment “Best Buy is doing just fine good bye” He was a grown man making fun of us. It was horrible. We understand store policy I don’t understand treating customers horribly.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x808f7e2607fb2393:0x3982d3901a2dbc98< /gmap_id></record>

Good selection, the people trained for Samsung are good at what they do. The customer service people are not nearly as good at customer service as the name suggests.  Did not explain service already paid for clearly and had to talk to someone out on the floor for better explanation and ability to use said service. Was a long visit, and a mess.< /review>

I lovd it there and person that I spoke to about the knowledge of equipment or headphones or stuff like that he was very knowledgeable to a point but after certain amount of questions that I need to know more about he did not know but he helped look it up and find out more information I love that Hospitality of that and when it came to check out the item that I bought it was quick and simple and very considerate loved it a lot...

But afterwards when I got ready to go out I realize that I needed a bag and I went up to the front service check out and as I was approaching the service to get a bag there was a woman working up there I didn't think much of it as I was approaching and getting the bag and paying for it she discriminated Me by accusing that I have stolen this item that I have purchase and as I was getting ready to go the security open front calmly asked me to give him the receipt which I did and he is very kind and polite about it and he said I'm sorry for this

butshe had no reason to do this but the woman was very disrespectful and I did not like this at all discrimination of race or Cutter or how the person distress does not mean that this person is still or any other kind stuff I did not enjoy that nor did I even like it...

Discrimination is against the law I thought about reporting her but one day she will get caught and she will get fired for discrimination....

But other than all of that everybody else that works there looks very polite and kind and willing to help anybody that needed some help and I very much appreciated it...

I would have gave this place at five star but due to the Discrimination I give it at 4 star....</review>

Sadly Electronic stores are merely places people go to check out a product before they go home and buy it online.  I really hope Best Buy realizes that and starts charging electronic makers money to display their products like advertisements. We need these establishments to withstand consumer trends.< /Review>

Ordered a 75 inch TV which came cracked. For the exchange they agreed to do the installation for free which was confirmed by two people at bestbuy. However when they delivered they denied ever agreeing to it. This is very disappointing< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Review>I just experienced HORRIBLE customer service...I received a holiday gift I was hoping to do an EXCHANGE not a return for a more expensive model. Because it was pasted the return date (Jan 14th and it was the 23rd) I somewhat understood but asked if I could speak to the manager. The employee laughed at my wife and I and actually made faces behind the manager and she also rejected us. We were trying to spend more money in the Harrison street location in San Francisco... We walked out swearing to never shop at Best Buy again based on how we’re treated. He even made the comment “Best Buy is doing just fine good bye” He was a grown man making fun of us. It was horrible. We understand store policy I don’t understand treating customers horribly.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808f7e2607fb2393:0x3982d3901a2dbc98<//GmapID></record>

<review>This is the worse best buy or buying experience! Avoid this place! Manager was not able to help at all for price matching. For sales that happened just yesterday they should still be able to give deals thay just happened recently to customers. Called branch they did not say it was labor day sale especially for a tourist i thought it was a standard price, best buy should be honoring this deals, wasted money going to branch totally disappointed!!!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE.  They are AWFUL.  The worst.  I will report them to better business.  I had a 8-12 delivery window.  They never came, no phone call.  Set up another 8-12 window, and at 1, I am still trying to track them down.  The business should be shut down.  Avoid at all costs.</Review>

I really hope Best Buy realizes that and starts charging electronic makers money to display their products like advertisements. We need these establishments to withstand consumer trends.<//Review></record>

While they may have the merchandise, this branch has very poor customer service and the staff's awareness and knowledge of where an item might be was very poor as well</Text>

I’ve been to many Best Buy’s but the customer service at this location is extraordinary. I helped my aunt who is in her 70s recently fix supper home and get all new technology TVs and some Wi-Fi so she could be part of this 21st-century. The first experience we had a young man help us and he was amazing and then the second experience we went in and the young woman who is in the TV department really hooked us up. We ended up purchasing a package so we could have somebody come and help my aunt said everything up very reasonable price and they helped her get all of the right equipment and haven’t even been back since it’s just nice to know that our elders can be taken care of and can be more connected to family with Best Buy’s help thank you geniuses geek squad and wonderful customer service people.</review>

If your looking to add a line online and pickup in store, DONT!

I experienced an issue where I purchased an iPad with with ATT service as an added line, but was left without use of the device.

The SIM card was activated post date for a month, yet no one was able to communicate that until I called Best Buy and they contacted their internal ATT customer service.

Just go in store and go thru the process there, so you don’t have to end up with a non working device and a huge waste of time for 2 store visits.</review>

apparently the manager Brandon is a very rude and arrogant individual.
Very disappointed and will never set foot into that particular best buy because i do not want to spend my money where they do not know how to treat customers.
Best buy please educate your store manager  about customer service or remove him from duties before you loose a good reputation.<//Text>

I went in to buy a computer. I knew exactly what I wanted. I approached 4 sales people: 1) guy 1 said he didn't work in customer service, 2) guy two took a picture of the item and never came back, 3) guy three said he'd call someone, and 4) guy 4 said he worked in phones and was flustered. In all, I spent about 45 minutes waiting before walking out.

I went across the street to Costco and bought a better computer - less expensive. Total transaction time was 10 minutes.

Buy a Costco membership and computer and save yourself the hassle. Plus, the Costco computer comes with tech support.

No wonder Best Buy can't compete. What a shame.< /review>

A fantastic experience with an onsite rep from HP really helped today.  The simple combination of Best Buy's customer service, price match guarantee, warranty policy and return policy made the purchase an easy one.  And, of course, a special shout to Alex Tu for the assist!</review>

This place has limited selection, customer service is non existent. I cancelled an American express purchase it took over a week to get my money back. Circuit city was much better.< /text>

I've been there twice now, at first I had a bad experience with one of the manager, however like anything - Can't judge a place like Best Buy by one bad or a bad experience.  As I mentioned, I had been there twice now and had bought a laptop and a tablet  - I am more than satisfied with the laptop I bought and got phenomenal price break.  Very happy with the place.< /Text>

Didn't have the item in stock that I needed, just a more expensive version.  Waited around for help finding this item while multiple employees stood around chatting.  Waited in line after deciding to spend the extra money.  Standing behind three people, one cashier on and watching three employees chit chat I'd had enough  Walked out and ill order it from Amazon tonight.< /Text>

<Text>This store was my favorite tech place before but considering my latest experience with them, I'll never come back. That's probably a once in a while experience but when it happens to you, you can get more than angry. They basically stole money from me and got away with it.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Do not go to this location. Each time I have been here the staff are rude and/or not trained properly. The last time I bought something from here, I was told I had a certain return policy that was then reneged on  when I tried to return the unopened item. One of the mangers, Mike, called me a lyer to my face. Nice customer service. Best buy sucks in general, but this store is crap in particular. Never again am I going back to this location. Just look at all the one star ratings below. Do you want to risk that on your expensive purchase?<//review>

<review>Hard to get helped.  Especially if you are in a hurry.  Too many items are locked up , or tethered, so you need an employee to help you with almost everything.  I dont' particularly enjoy shopping in a place that resembles a " nazi" environment.  This makes it an uncomfortable place to shop, but they have everything and are pretty much the only game in town when it comes to electronics.  Police are on the scene and you better believe they are watching.  Very similar to any Target store in SF.  Not so good.  Kind of borders on intrusion of privacy as security cameras seem to be able to get close up of your DNA.  Bad energy. Good. Electronics.< /review><user_name>Kevin Kawasaki< /user_name><response>None</response><userid>105733707176978911133<//userid>< Pictures>

<Text>😂😂😂😂 haha this BestBuy has the employees with bad attitudes. Particularly the salesperson is so rude I had never encountered in any Best Buy location before. She is like giving the stuff for free on her own cost. If you don’t know how to handle customers, or don’t like customers get away from there. By the way she was busy with her own stuff while at work. Totally full of unprofessional staffs.</Text>< Pictures>

The challenge at Best Buy is getting waiting on. Staff spends a lot of time with each other. With customers? Not so much.< /Review>

< review>
I had actually called ahead a few days before and made the purchase online so that I would not have to spend more time in the store then I had to! The only problem I find is that  I had called the  Friday before  and thought that I would have the product  for a Saturday  encounter where I would definitely need it to meet the task at hand! Well the store opens at 10  and I figured that give them enough time  to notify me by text or email certainly by noon certainly long before my 1 p.m. assignment! The the purchase was a Samsung wireless charger that I would need for my cell phone which I probably would be using for a number of hours without pause! They was not a call or text or an email the entire morning and 1 p.m. came and went and still no notification! Unacceptable! The young woman at the pick-up counter was exemplary courteous and respectful and she actually got me in and out of the store pickup counter inside of 2 minutes! Fast efficient and effective. Thank you! Then I made the fatal mistake of purchasing an extra wireless charger because that was my purchase that evening! So I went over to the mobile Department and asked a young man if he could point me in the direction of that particular Samsung product and he looked absolutely lost and he turned to another young lady who became even more disoriented! Finally what the first store employee did was to run over and get a Samsung representative someone that doesn't work for Best Buy! I should be honest with you I felt like even he wasn't sure if he was providing me with the product that I was looking to purchase but purchase I did! No one there tonight instilled me with confidence that they knew their products!< /review>

It's better to go the rest of your life without electronics than to set foot in this Best Buy. Worst service imaginable. The right person wasn't there to receive me for my appointment. The agent who did receive me clocked out mid-appointment. The second agent proceeded to take forever collecting my information and then accidentally lost it by getting locked out of the system. I had to explain seven times that they should not call me or request calls from me since they are in possession of my only phone. Complete imbeciles.< /text>

<Text>The first time I went here they sold me a laptop that was way to weak for what I was after. The second time, they sold me an out of box laptop that already had hardware issues. The third time, they pointed me to a laptop that was an awkward hybrid with a tablet and had underwhelming performance for its $1000 price tag.

BAD products at HIGH prices and an overall TEPID customer experience.

I give them 2 stars because they honored their return policy.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Walked in looking for a smart watch couldn't find anyone to help me. When I did he said he didn't work for that department. Finally found someone but he didn't have access to get the watch, he did however look it up on the computer to see if it was in stock. I asked if I can pay with American Express Gift check and they said no when their website claims they do. Just because they do know how to process it does not mean they don't accept them. Ultimately this place is lacking customer service , if you know what you want and it's not locked up then it's great. Otherwise find another Best Buy to spend your money at.<//review>

As with many stores of this type, Best Buy carries less and less product.  A large selection of TVs.  Gaming. Kitchen appliances. Still exist.  Every once in awhile, they rearrange the store and you discover something else missing. The usual, "we only carry that on our website" story comes across more and more.
Let's be honest, if I didn't need it right now, I would have already ordered it on Amazon.  Way to miss the point of being a brick-mortar store Best Buy.
This particular store is clean, bright, and well staffed with people who can check you out and answer questions by searching their website for you.<//Text>

The worse service ever
Not only the manager wasn't helpful but he also was so rude, he didn't want to help, he didn't offer any solution and just walked away
Definitely not coming back again</Text>

I have been their customer for the last 8 years. I buy the bulk of my computers thru them Their Geek squad is very knowledgeable and their remote service is genuine and I have been able to resolve computer issues successfully with their competent assistance.</review>

Well, Best Buy has risen from the dead and this location is not too bad. Large selection of all things electronic, prices are mostly comparable to what you'll find online. Oh, and wasn't that the main reason why they were supposed to go bankrupt in the first place?

Nice thing that parking is free (find that in the city!) and that you can combine a visit with a) a toilet break and b) the El Tonayense Taco Truck in front of it.

Deal and Deal.</review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

Went in to buy a new laptop since my last one died on me. The rarity of the method of payment since I used an international credit card. When my card was declined initially, the BB staff was patient as I had to explain to the bank that I am actually trying to purchase a +$1500 computer. Even 20 min after my initial attempt of purchase, yhe staffs were cool amd patient with me until my bank took off the lock on my card.<//text>

<rate>5</rate><review>I ended up going to BB because Amazon failed me again on next day delivery of my law practice mission critical desktop computer power supply. This happens far too often when I select a particular product over others because it is promised the next day when I need it the next day. Anyway, I felt like a bit of a fool for not realizing that BB's prices, on power supplies at least, meet or beat Amazon's. Online options couldn't match Amazon for next day delivery, but I am realizing that Amazon's next day promise is not all that it's cracked up to be. So the selection of Gold rated PSUs was limited in the store, but it was guaranteed to be in my computer that day. And the price was better than the same model on Amazon. That doesn't really matter anyway because BB would have matched Amazon's price if it was lower. To top it all off, the sales guy took his time to check their inventory to give me as many options as possible. And he told me that I could return the PSU I bought from BB within 2 weeks even after it was installed as long as it wasn't damaged. So he suggested that I could return the PSU if I wanted to keep the one from Amazon when it finally arrived. Essentially, they don't mind if you buy theirs as a loaner. Even though I paid more for the one from BB, I am keeping it because I got more for my buck and I want to reward their terrific pricing and policies.</review>< pictures>

<review>NEVER park at this Best Buy!! They employ a predatory tow company that will tow out to a rough part of the dogpatch and charge >$600 to get your car back. In no world is it justified to add gouging fees such as 190 bucks TO UNLOCK THE TOW YARD GATE!! If you have the displeasure of having your car preyed on make sure to wear warm clothes because they won't send anyone out to unlock your car to you get there and it'll take upwards of an hour till their henchmen come

Do yourself a favor and buy your HP laptops online where you won't be coerced to buy an over-budget pc< /review>< pictures>

<review>Went in to buy a new laptop since my last one died on me. The rarity of the method of payment since I used an international credit card. When my card was declined initially, the BB staff was patient as I had to explain to the bank that I am actually trying to purchase a +$1500 computer. Even 20 min after my initial attempt of purchase, yhe staffs were cool amd patient with me until my bank took off the lock on my card.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I just left the geek squad very angry and dissatisfied after having an appointment waiting and then having the geek blow me off for what seemed like he just didn't wanna go through a teaching prosess with me
My sisterand I have spent a small fortune in this best buy and I believe I will take my business else where< /review>

Shopped at San Francisco store #187.  I had done my "homework" and knew exactly which TV I wanted to see and purchase.  Within seconds of entering the TV department, Leticia greeted me with a smile and asked if I needed assistance.  She was able to show me a comparable TV in the same brand and discussed all the features and benefits.  She knows her stuff!  She didn't try to switch brands or confuse me in any way.  I was also interested in looking at a compatible sound bar for the TV, and she was successful in upselling me the appropriate model.  She also quickly grabbed the necessary cables I would need and then quickly and efficiently rang me up, went over the receipt and pickup instructions, and got me on my way.  Very sweet, knowledgable, professional, and even told me her days off in case I had any questions.  She made what could have been an arduous experience very fun and pleasant in under 45 minutes!< /Text>

Run of the mill Best Buy.  Staff isn’t very friendly- often follow me around like I’m shoplifting.  Good deals, but like the rest of the megastores, I’m not sure  that’s a good thing.
Be sure to look for open box deals here.</Text>

<Response>None<//Response><Text>Helpful staff but store policies do not allow you to open up a box to see what's inside, but they allow you to buy and refund later which is a pretty strange policy since it's easier to see if the product fits your requirement before purchase rather then doing the whole purchase process and then the whole refund process if it doesn't fit.< /Text>< username>

< review>
I was very badly advised when I bought my Samsung Laptop. I wanted a lot of memory and I was sold the lowest amount. I did not check and was not thinking that it is a "buyer beware' store that I spent $1,500 in. When I called to communicate my upset I was sent to 5 different people. The last one took my phone number and gave me a case number. I never even got a call-back from anybody at the store. It is costing me an extra $500 to get a functioning laptop. I will never ever buy anything else at Best Buy! Buyer Beware!<//review>

<review>Every time I go here the employees are actually super helpful, polite, and down to earth. I went in looking to decide between two major gaming laptops, I was approached by Henry who was so super knowledgeable and helpful. He didn’t demean me make me feel stupid, we had a great conversation and he gave me information beyond what I thought I needed to know about these machines. He then directed me to Jason who is this Best Buy’s Alienware representative. Jason was also full of useful information for me and talked with me for almost an hour about some alienware computers and his own experience and background. I’m blown away by how helpful and kind these guys were! Would recommend this store especially if you’re looking to buy a computer.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Weren't they supposed to go bankrupt? I clearly missed something. Well, Best Buy has risen from the dead and this location is not too bad. Large selection of all things electronic, prices are mostly comparable to what you'll find online. Oh, and wasn't that the main reason why they were supposed to go bankrupt in the first place?

Nice thing that parking is free (find that in the city!) and that you can combine a visit with a) a toilet break and b) the El Tonayense Taco Truck in front of it.

Deal and Deal.< /review>

Even though I was pretty certain that the problem with my laptop was a hard drive problem, not a virus, the geekers told me that it was probably a virus and that I needed to buy their virus protection plan for $200.00.  The problem was the hard drive after all and I was told that I needed to pay $50.00 to recover my data.  Are these guys computer repairmen or just sales people selling unwanted and unneeded gimmicks?
Then I received an e-mail telling me that I could pick up my laptop because it was finished.  I'm 67 years old and have difficulty walking bit I walked and bused to the store only to find that my computer hadn't even been worked on.  My next e-mail from them told me that my laptop was picked up by me and that their file had been closed.  I hadn't picked it up and had no idea where my computer was.  Yesterday I received a phone call telling me that my computer was ready and an explanation of sorts as to why I got the notice that the file was closed. Today I will go again to pick up my laptop.  I hope it's fixed.<//Text>

<text>I want to like BestBuy, and it is usually the first place I think of going to if I am not buying on Amazon, but they suck. I took the day off from work using a vacation day, waited for my delivery of my washer and dryer, and when it arrived, they did not have the stacking kit. The sales guy went on and on about that we need to have the stacking kit and then he screwed up the order. It's not right that it cost me two days off, today that they screwed up, and now next week.

I should have gone with my guy and stuck with Home Depot. I am still tempted to just cancel the order and purchase it from Home Depot.

I purchased a washer/dryer set from Best Buy store, after confirming they had the models in stock and would deliver within 2 days - I made it clear this was a dependency for the order (I had already researched two other purchase options, should Best Buy not be able to meet that need).

On the first deliver attempt, it was discovered that a 220v outlet was needed. (this had not been in the pre-delivery checklist, and the old set used 110v).  They would not do the delivery 'as is' (leaving the equipment and letting me plug it in when the wiring was complete). I chalked this up to "stuff happens", and had the wiring corrected the next day.

But the new delivery window was pushed for 5 days, and they had changed the model requested from electric to gas (which I only caught by accident).  On the next date they never showed up.  I called them and was informed they had come by, but my "street is too narrow for the delivery van and a smaller delivery truck would need to be scheduled".  My street is almost twice as wide as a standard car lane, and they had been here before so they should have known if there was going to be an issue.  I was blamed for not telling them about this 'special need'.  When I escalated the call, the supervisor refused to promise any date, and said I'd have to call again tomorrow because my delivery was still 'in transit'.

The next day they offered a date of one week out.  That date has not yet arrived, so there's still plenty of room for further problems and delays, and even if fulfilled, it will have been 3 weeks since my purchase and 3 full days of lost work for me.  While they have been civil, they have not been professional:  they attribute any issue as my fault and every reschedule goes to the bottom of their queue, rather than being treated as an escalation.< /text>

San Francisco's 13th & Harrison

The employees at this Best Buy always greet me nicely and acknowledge me as a regular patron. Additionally when I'm in departments I don't regularly frequent the staff there always make sure I've been helped.

They are knowledgeable.

When the internet says an item is in stock but we don't see a copy on the floor employees have gone out of their way to locate my missing items, from an Android tablet all the way down to a 'missing' Blu Ray disk. When my new laptop died within the return window they did not grill me as if they assumed I had damaged the device.

I find the store always orderly and clean.

The only reason to not give them 5 star rating is they don't give me electronics for free.< /Text>

At Best Buy, we strive to have a wide variety of products to fit our customer’s needs and are concerned to hear that was unachievable. I also would be disappointed if the location didn't carry the product I was looking forward to buying. Whenever you notice products unavailable in the store, we encourage you to view BestBuy.com or our Best Buy Mobile app. You'll notice a larger selection of wall mounts available to order that may suit your needs. While you are visiting the website, you'll see we offer customers to take advantage of our Price Match Guarantee. This guarantee entails us matching the price of key online and local competitors at the time of purchase, as well as through the return policy. We hope this information has provided you peace of mind on your future shopping experiences.

Clean and stock was neatly displayed. Looking for accessories for new Samsung Note 7 (pre-recall), they didn't have much of anything. The phone was new so I guess this is somewhat acceptable.<//text>

Yes a good best buy but.... check the price online as when you go in-store it's not always updated.also make you get your free gift if there is one on promotion with your product ss they will happily forget to give it to you.</text>

<Text>Over the years the level help has dropped greatly with lack of knowledge of products they support. Poor quality connection cables power cables audio cables phone cables and computer cables of their insignia brand has dropped to the quality of the garbage RadioShack cables and power cords grotesquely overpriced cheap Chinese knock off chords. You often find them poor fit and performance sometimes their power caring capabilities are so poor incompatible with some Apple devices and android devices or you get extremely slow charging due to the lack of copper wire gauge in their poor quality products.<//Text>< pics>

<Text>Being the flagship store  in San Francisco. You would think that the customer service in this store would be top notch. You would be wrong, from entering to leaving, you are not welcomed. Most of the employees are too busy with their pet projects of the day. Managers seem not to exist either. For I have not seen one when asked for them.
I've limited my inter-action to pick up orders now. Less time inside this store.
If you can get past the service the place is at least a good pick up place for your shipped electronics<//Text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I went in looking for a router and a modem. Immediately, I could identify tens for employees who appeared more than ready to help. Went in, found what I was looking for, price-matched one of the items I was purchasing, got some food recommendations, paid, and left, relatively painlessly.<//Review>< pics>

< review>
This Best Buy is sub par as far as electonics sales stores go. First off there are multiple armed guards at the entrance/exit that mad Dogg everyone that comes in no matter if you are 13 or 75...it's a little intimidating to say the least. The wifi in the store is so finicky that trying to test a laptop by surfing the web on it is impossible. The sales staff is mostly there to keep people from steeling stuff as they are very uneducated about the products. The last thing that makes this particular store sub par is 99% of everything in the store is tied down, locked, or is a piece of cardboard that you have to give to someone to go fetch it for you. I imagine because crime is so prevalent here. So ask yourself do you want to spend $500 in a store that has armed guards & every item under lock and key because people in the store are mostly theifs??? Not me, unless really desperate!< /review>

<text>All the blood and guts aside it felt like a slap in the face. The whole  experience was amazing they took $11.00 cash and I got $299.99 (finally truth in advertising UNDER $300.00 this is true thanks to you pennie) in  audio toys for adults. So I bestow the highest of all praise 3 stars! I only believe in the validity of the first three stars. The 4th and 5th star was devised soley to apeas the self absorbed narcisist egomaniac warlord. In cases of the extremly tyrannical a meaningless wholly redundant 6th star has sometimes been reported.< /text>< pictures>

Considering this is San Francisco, it is difficult to find space for anything.  This San Francisco is big in size, selection and does not feel cramped at all.  You can browse and try demos of many products as you will.  Love it!</Text>

< Review>
Customer service is bad because they reward employees with hours instead of commissions. You sell more. You work more. If you ask questions, they aren't selling and aren't getting hours, and naturally don't want to help. As an x employee, I was pulled left and right to translate because I'm bilingual and lost hours as a result. Does that seem fair?</Review>

< Review>
NEVER EVER, EVER BUY A CAMERA HERE!!!!  Awful customer service!  We bought an $1800 camera before going on holiday and discovered it had issues.  All of the photos have black spots over them.  We took it back and they refuse to accept a return and say it needs to be sent to Sony or their Geek Squad (4 to 6 weeks turnaround)

We were unsure about the camera in the beginning and brought it back to the shop but the sales rep persuaded us to keep it, unpack it, and try it out properly.  We mentioned we were going on holiday for 10 days and he said it was not a problem if we came back in as soon as we came back.  We came in as soon as possible after arriving.

It might be convenient to buy items in Best Buy but use Amazon or somewhere with better customer service and a better return policy if there are issues with the electronics!

They are very friendly on the sales floor but are useless and unwilling to help on customer service!!< /Review>

I only ever do in-store pickups there, so what do I know. I did appreciate that when I was looking at 4K OLED HDR TVs that the staff was willing to price match if I wanted to. Plenty of staff said "may I help you?" for the only 5-10min I was in there.<//Review>

A large electronics chain store wth fairly low prices. The service quick and polite but since the store is quite large, finding things can be overwhelming. The toilet is located to the left of the entrance.</Text>

< Review>
They had amazing deals on laptop. My frnd had got Mac book pro base model in a very discounted rate which was a great deal. The person who assisted us was very frndly and polite. But You might find a bit hard time getting someone to consult you coz the number of people assisting you will be just 1 , but customers are more. But that wait time was worth it, coz we got our deal.</Review>

<Review>It'll do in a pinch; they have the basics. Prices good if things are on sale. Can be tough to find either available,  helpful, and/or knowledgeable sales associates. Lots of free parking; slow down because the speed bumps at the entrance are pretty brutal.</Review><time>1498771743401<//time>< Pics>

<text>They had amazing deals on laptop. My frnd had got Mac book pro base model in a very discounted rate which was a great deal. The person who assisted us was very frndly and polite. But You might find a bit hard time getting someone to consult you coz the number of people assisting you will be just 1 , but customers are more. But that wait time was worth it, coz we got our deal.</text>< Pictures>

< review>
Terrible experience with Magnolia services: I bought a very expensive  service to fix my home theater about two and a half weeks ago. Nobody called to take an appointment despite my repeated reminders. Nothing happened but money was taken off my bank account almost immediately.  I finally reached the agent named Michael "O'Shea who has taken my order. Instead of finding a solution he accused me of harrassing him by calling his mobile number. Unbelievable attitude. Last anecdote, I spoke to the store manager  yesterday, a guy named Antony and explained my problem. He promised to enquire and to call me back today. No call received, I called to enquire and heard that he was gone on vacation.  LOOKS LIKE A COMPANY GOING OUT OF BUSINESS.<//review>

Fifteen years into the most vibrant years of the internet revolution, this company still hasn't figured out how to satisfy - let alone please - the customer at the most basic level. I'll continue to showroom and then buy on Amazon.< /review>

Everytime I've gone to this Best Buy it has been busy.  Friendly employees when you can find one who is not helping another customer.<//text>

now that we buy most of this stuff online, I wonder how they stay in business.. occasionally you can find special prices or order online and pick up at the store for particular bargains, but Amazon and others usually beat their prices now< /Review>

<Review>Me my wife and kid came here today at 11 in the morning for the 179$ doorbuster TV deal, we were about 20th in line but when they passed out the tickets there were not enough for us, disappointing but not why they get 1 star, I then saw a lady who showed up at 3PM and was behind us go into the store, I said to the GENERAL MANAGER "she's not getting a tv is she because me and my wife and kid were here 4 hours before her" he said " no she's just opening a credit card if anyone gives her a tv they would be fired " So when I walk into the store at 5 when they opened the door what a surprise that lady that showed up at 3PM received a ticket and got the 179$ TV when I got angry about this I was kicked out of the store and received no explanation why someone who arrived 4 HOURS AFTER ME RECEIVED A TV AND ME AND MY FAMILY WENT HOME EMPTY HANDED THANKS FOR THE GREAT THANKSGIVING BEST BUY 6 HOURS FOR NOTHING I am cancelling my order of 2 laptops I made with them last night, they will not receive any more business from me ever again no one should be lied to and cheated like that especially after waiting in line 6 hours, first come first serve is a lie don't come to these black friday deals.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808f7e2607fb2393:0x3982d3901a2dbc98<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>It's hard to find a friendly sales associate willing to help you. They're standing around or don't work in the Section you need. They usually don't smile or walk up to say hello past the front door. I purchased a laptop last year out the box I had a really great guy salesperson. He was very knowledgeable, friendly, open to ask questions. In the end I got a great open box laptop that was top of the line at a great price. He gave me good advice and said if I had more questions I could call the store back or come in. I'm glad I came by that day it was raining hard outside but worth it every bit. The guy was named Steve big friendly guy. I can see why Best Buy hired him lol. I recently came to buy a pair of Beats headphones treating myself. My rep was not knowledgeable or friendly. But I was glad to get in and out and away from him. I was asking him about phones I turned around he wasn't anywhere by me. He had walked off after ringing me up damm. Even though this will not stop me from shopping at Best Buy the customer service reps need more training dealing with the public. I know they're usually young but you have to start somewhere. By the way I have been in retail over 20 years so im always trying to spend it to treat myself. Thank you for the chance to share my experience shopping at the Harrison location store.< /Review>< Name>

The Magnolia inside the shop sold me a dead subwoofer.  When I returned it, one guy looked at the other and asked him if he tested it and he replied yes.  I then asked them to try with their system -- and of course it was dead.  Wasted two trips there.  Save yourself the trouble and buy somewhere else.  I would suggest Onecall -- they are awesome!</Review>

<Review>The young man with the thick framed black glasses and coily black hair, was very helpful with assisting me in making a major life changing investment by recommending that the zombie phone I was purchasing is the perfect device for older people whom are transitioning from antiquated technology to the toys of the new 21st century.

Something young folk these days take for granted with their own internet addiction personal issues.
Because my Obama phone was a hunk of junk with not enough RAM for my needs, while the Samsung J7 is one of the last modern zombie phones to have replaceable batteries, easy to access functions and features, simple lay out for people with giant paws like me - can use, without wanting to throw it into the bay from frustration.

Although the factory ringtones stink something awful.

I wish Best Buy stocked their beverage coolers with liter bottles of popular top 3 or 5 beverages. I refuse to pay 2 bucks or more for a tiny 20 oz bottle of soda.

Sadly this Best Buy only has new inventory for the latest models of new gadgets, if you desire accessories for any of the older or previously top models, now relegated to last years premium models and this years better prepaid phones locked/unlocked. You have to search online at a website.<//Review><GmapID>0x808f7e2607fb2393:0x3982d3901a2dbc98<//GmapID>< Name>

<review>We ordered a washer and dryer from here and 3 months later after they have canceled appointment after appointment because not all parts were there I canceled my order.  Hours spent on the phone with incompetent people who never know where your order is or why suddenly it's missing a part.  Trish tried to help but it has more to do with their warehouse and bad organization.  I ended up going local and buying at Cherins as I should have to begin with.The idea of saving a few hundred buck ended up costing more in laundry bills.  I will never buy anything there again.<//review>< pictures>

WOW!
How little they know their own products that they are selling.
I walking and looking for a VGA to HTMI converter adapter.  The salesperson think the HTMI to VGA converter adapter is the same as the VGA to HTMI converter adapter.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I had an appointment with the geek squad in 1717 Harrison Str San Fransisco. The guy that helped me was quick, professional and helpful, even if he was new to the aria, and probably also to this job. No unnecessary standard corporate BS about bla bla. He was knowledgeble and shared useful information freely with me. He saved me both time and money.  I love it when people are "to the point"!
So 4 stars for doing a great job and being interesting, and the extra star for not boring me with the corporate clone jabbing. Thumbs up.< /Review><UserId.>106402974417404411504< /UserId.><gmapID>0x808f7e2607fb2393:0x3982d3901a2dbc98</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Terrible customer service. If you choose to spend your money here, consider a never to be seen again. They are awful with refunds. Buyer beware.</text>

How I hate this Best Buy. They have too many returned items on the shelves. The place is a mess, and the staff just doesn't care.</review>

I bought a computer with a 2 year warranty. It broke a week later. They gave me a hard time about getting it replaced. They just seemed to want to waste as much of my time as possible. Every time I get it serviced, it comes back worse than it was. It takes a month to send out.</Review>

It's just okay.  You kinda have to know exactly what you are looking for or have no idea at all and just buy what they sell you.  Not really the place you want to be for advice.< /Review>

<Review>The staff needs their name tags to figure out who they are... (and I wouldn't be surprised if their names change daily).
However, they have a fair selection and average pricing.  Just don't expect anyone to be capable of helping you with information.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

Spent almost 1000 dollars on new sprint phones the Mobile department was unsatisfying I was told fees were going to be waived by sprint (i.e. the fees were not so add 20.00 more I had to still pay) mangers where laughing when I came back to tell them about the issue. I wish I did not have to go to this best buy nobody has the drive to see customers happy they are just there. It is sadly the truth!!!< /Text>

<text>Several months ago, I decided to purchase my first television. As I had never done such a thing, I thought I should go somewhere where they dealt with such a thing all day long. We pow-wowed over the things that I would need, and ultimately came down to a love 32" 1080p television, a roku3, and an insignia sound bar. Excited, and assured I had everything I needed to enjoy my new purchases, I poured myself into a cab and headed for home.

T.V. set-up was a breeze, but my first snag came when I opened the Roku. If you think that for $90, all of the necessary parts would be there, you'd be as surprised as I was. So, annoyed that I didn't actually have everything as I was told, I grabbed a book and called it a night.

The next day, venturing after work back to Best Buy, I has sold the HDMI cable that I wasn't the day before. "At last, victory shall be mine!" I quietly thought to myself as I headed for the closet bust stop that would take me home. Back home, I set up the roku, get my amazon and netflix accounts set up, and proceed to enjoy a movie. "huh, that's not a lot of sound coming from the sound bar" is my very first thought.

Naturally, there was no sound coming from it, though it was on and plugged in. Bummed with the thought that I had bought a bad bar, I used the bluetooth on my phone to see if it worked. Like a charm, I hear "this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles" instantly thump out of the speakers. I surmise it must be the cord that is just no good, so I toss it and enjoy my movie with the T.V. speakers.

Round 3, I check again with an associate that I shouldn't be experiencing this issue, and I buy a new cord to plug into the bar and T.V. Still no sound. Really? Suffering a severe case of Forest Whittaker eye over this entire situation, I again just watch a movie and snooze.

Just last night, I finally decided to get the problem sorted once and for all. Or so I thought. 15 minutes waiting for an associate to be available to assist me, I describe my issue with the no sound, tell him which TV and sound bar I’ve bought, and he sells me a ‘Digital Optical Audio Cable’, though I expressed concern that it didn’t look like anything on my sound bar would be a plug.

“its what you need.”

So home I went, no longer confident that anything I’m being told is true, but still crossing my fingers that it would work.

I’m sure you know by now that it did not.

In my attempt to avoid being incompatible hardware, buying things I did not need, not buying things I did need, and generally dealing with a giant debacle in my first TV purchase, I was handed that very thing at the hands what I was to believe were people smart on the issue. In a time that I could have bought everything on Amazon, for less, and had only myself to blame, I paid more to get raked over the coals.

I love Best Buy, the layout, the cleanliness, the assortment of selection. But for me, your customer service doth butter no parsnips. What I experienced is an example of a complete lack of proper training, knowledge, and on-going staff education that reflects extremely poorly of the management at this store. Save yourself and just buy it on Amazon.<//text><user_id>111109830728789022744<//user_id><Pictures>None</Pictures><Time>1442429140443</Time>< rate>

{'time': 1555601877510, 'text': 'Hi Camille,\n\nThanks for your review. Your concern has been brought to our attention around you desiring other Best Buy stores to be nearby the Harrison St. San Francisco location. For transparency, I did research and found three stores that are within a 10-mile radius of the Harrison St. Best Buy. These Best Buy locations are the Emeryville Oakland store, the Colma store, and the San Bruno store. Though traffic conditions can make the commute seem longer than the 10 miles, your want is understandable. Whenever you have location inquiries, we recommend you visit BestBuy.com and search keyword "locations". You\'ll notice the store locator page with a detailed map showing you nearby Best Buy locations based on the zip code you enter. I am happy I had the opportunity to provide you this information and hope it will assist you during future commutes. Thanks for shopping at Best Buy.\n\nBest Regards,\nBri\nBest Buy Support'}<//response>

I buy a fridge, we setup a delivery time of 12-4, and NO SHOW.  I call at 2pm and i get, "an hour to an hour and a half", which means 3-3:30.  It's now past 4:30pm and NO FRIDGE and NO PHONE CALL.  They have not called me even once to tell me they were running late, etc.  Nothing.  NO COMMUNICATION.  This is unacceptable.< /review>

I went here to get a few things while traveling. It was difficult to find my way around in the store, but the friendly staff gave me the assistance I needed to find the goods to buy. Chromebook dept. was ridiculously small in my eyes.< /review>

<Text>Customer Service is bad, really bad. Cashiers cared to talk more between them than to help the line of people waiting to pay. I told the person greeting at the entrance that service needed to improve and she said only 'ok' with sarcasm. If you can avoid this place.<//Text><GmapID>0x808f7e2607fb2393:0x3982d3901a2dbc98</GmapID><Rating>1<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) Danger zone. Do not go to that area. The difference they make in the purchase is not worth the bad blood one gets. Break the cars and the employees of the place warn you. No cameras are security or surveillance despite knowing these roofs.

Zona peligrosa. No vayan a esa zona. La diferencia que hacen en la compra no vale la pena la mala sangre que uno se hace. Rompen los autos y los empleados del lugar te lo advierten. No hay cámaras se seguridad ni vigilancia a pesar de saber de estos techos.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Everything in electronics! You can find the 61-inch TV from your mouse. Video games, accessories, cameras, appliances, cell phones, watches and everything with origin and warranty. Only products from major brands and with attractive prices. Be sure to visit Black Friday and check out unbelievable prices. Every visit to the USA I make my mandatory stop.
The money exchange and return policy is efficient and functional. I already had to change 2 products being a notebook and an electric razor and I had no problem. Very good service and some units offer Portuguese-speaking employees.

A política de troca e devolução de dinheiro é eficiente e funcional. Já precisei trocar 2 produtos sendo um notebook e um barbeador elétrico e não tive qualquer problema. Atendimento muito bom e algumas unidades oferecem funcionários que falam português.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Leave the vehicle half an hour parked in the Best Buy parking lot and smash the glass to steal. When an employee arrived, she warned us not to leave anything in sight. We did it that way but they broke it anyway. Unfortunately (and in an irresponsible way) Best Buy does not have security cameras. Do not go to this site if you can avoid it

(Original)
Deje el vehículo media hora estacionado en el parking de Best Buy y rompieron el vidrio para robar. Ya al llegar una empleada nos advirtió que no dejásemos nada a la vista. Así lo hicimos pero de todos modos lo rompieron. Lamentablemente (y de forma poco responsable) Best Buy no tiene cámaras de seguridad. No vayan a este sitio si pueden evitarlo</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Excellent store, the best Best Buy I have ever been to. The service is very good, they speak fluent Spanish and they take all the time you need so that you can decide your purchase with peace of mind. Lots of variety and on top of that you can go with pets. The parking lot is huge and it is handy to any public transport or walking from the center. Highly recommended

(Original)
Excelente tienda, la mejor Best Buy que he ido. La atención es muy buena, hablan español con fluidez y se toman todo el tiempo que necesites para que decidas tu compra con tranquilidad. Muchísima variedad y encima se puede ir con mascotas. El estacionamiento es enorme y queda mano de cualquier transporte público o caminando desde el centro.

(Translated by Google) Regular service! Difficult to find available salesman, even with the store empty! Enclosed bathrooms, you need to ask for a password at the entrance to be used! Wrong change at the cashier, if I hadn't checked it would be more expensive to buy (I paid in cash)

<Text>(Translated by Google) The choice is not bad, but I had to scream loudly and call a consultant. The first consultant approached and listened and went to the warehouse to check availability. In fact - wandered around the room, no longer came to us.
The second said that they have no new Kindle oasis. In fact, I was mistaken, the oasis of 2017 is not so big, I mixed up with the previous model. But I’m okay - the seller also did not know which model they had and said that there was no new model.
Although overall the store is pleasant, the selection is wide. But this nuance with consultants ....

(Original)
Выбор неплохой, но мне пришлось громко кричать и подзывать консультанта. Первый подошедший консультант послушал и ушел на склад проверять наличие. На самом деле - бродил по залу, к нам больше не подходил.
Второй сказал, что нового киндл оазиса у них нет. На самом деле я ошиблась, оазис 2017 года не такой большой, я перепутала с предыдущей моделью. Но я-то ладно - продавец тоже не знал, какая у них модель и сказал, что новой модели нет.
Хотя в целом магазин приятный, выбор большой. Но вот этот нюанс с консультантами....<//Text>< date>

(Translated by Google) I didn't want to go to the American before I came to this place I learned from American movies. The last day we stopped at Best Buy in San Francisco. Prices are deplorable. In Turkey, I am getting to this place that supplies price tag. If I try to buy here, I guarantee both the warranty and I need to buy the tax at the label price. I saw now unsold products in Turkey. If you stop something that is not going to get cheaper in Turkey but do not expect to get from Turkey.

(Original)
Amerikan filmlerinden dizilerinden öğrendiğim bu yere uğramadan amerikadan gitmek istemedim. Son gün San Francisco'da Best Buy'a uğradık. Fiyatlar içler acısı. Türkiye'de, buranın etiket fiyatına alıyorum ben o malzemeleri. Burada almaya kalksam hem garantim yanıyor hem de etiket fiyatına vergi ekleyip satınalmam gerekiyor. Türkiye'de şuanda satılmayan ürünleri gördüm. Eğer Türkiye'de olmayan birşey alacaksanız uğrayın ama Türkiye'den ucuza almayı ummayın.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Leave all hope or you who enter! What can I say, there is everything is a real drug, even if you do not need anything you will definitely leave this shop with some "very useful" gadget or, why not, a portable PC that you felt an extreme need!

(Translated by Google) I really enjoyed going to Best Buy, they have a huge variety of electronics and other varieties, and the products come at a great price in most cases, the staff service is great, they are polite, the store is well organized, It could be a little closer to downtown San Francisco, but the store is top, just worth stopping by.

(Translated by Google) It is wonderful! You find all kinds of technological accessories. I went to look for some cell phones that my cousin bought online (it was sooo cheap), and I came out with a computer, headphones, memory cards, among other things. For people who go from another country, it is ideal to buy technology because it is much cheaper than in my country.

(Original)
Es maravilloso! Encuentras todo tipo de accesorios tecnológicos. Fui a buscar unos celulares que mi primo compró por internet (le salía muuuy barato), y salí con computador, audífonos, tarjetas de memoria, entre otras cosas.

<text>(Translated by Google) Buy a Bluetooth at the Harrison st store in SF. They offered me a guarantee in case it broke or was ruined, I bought it.
When my Bluetooth broke and I brought it to the store, the same cashier who sold me the warranty told me that it does not cover it.
My great question because they offer the guarantee if when I want to use it they do everything possible so that the client does not use it.
I have been a customer of this store for years but today I felt cheated, the worst thing is that the CUSTOMER SEVICE that attended me was Latina like me.
I only get the money back from the guarantee so I can leave.

Compre un Bluetooth en la tienda de la Harrison st en SF. Me ofrecieron una garantía por si rompia o se arruinaba, la compre.
Cuando se me rompio mi Bluetooth y lo traje a la tienda la misma cajera que me vendio la garantia me dijo que eso no lo cubre.
Mi gran prugunta por que ofrecen la garantía si cuando la quiero usar hacen lo imposible para que el cliente no lo use.
Soy cliente por años de esta tienda pero hoy me sentí estafado lo peor es que la de CUSTOMER SEVICE que me atendió era Latina como yo.
Solo me regreso el dinero de la garantia para que me fuera.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>
