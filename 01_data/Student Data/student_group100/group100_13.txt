Great place! Friendly, kind people. Good coffee. Only problem at times is their slow but through attention to detail leads to a bit of a wait during busy times. Great bagel or croisamr breakfast sandwiches. Try the mexican mocha coffee. Yummy!< /Review>

Have visited this place quite a few times.  It's consistently good.  Good variety of espresso and non-caffiene drinks.  They also have a great assortment of pastries and serve sandwiches.  The bagel and cream cheese was delectable!  It was fresh and tasty.</review>

The staff here are very friendly and open to recommendations. The cafe is interesting, exudes the charm of the old world. There are also some like front patio places. The staff service was great. The coffee is very tasty, it is not the central part of the city and therefore there are not enough places with the same quality as here. Will definitely be back and recommend.<//text>

Surprisingly good neighborhood coffee plus bagel place.  They custom made my egg, ham and cheese bagel and it came packed with flavor.  Paired with chai latte mixed oat milk for $10 was perfect way to start the morning.</text>

<Text>Always a warm and friendly place to relax and get a cup of your favorite hot morning beverage.  Dogs are welcome outside on the covered patio.  Sandwiches and sweets are available for breakfast or lunch.  Smoothies and other drinks are available if you're looking for cool refreshment.  We enjoy just sitting and relaxing, talking with our neighbors or just people watching while on a morning walk.  A truly nice place to visit.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Decent bagels and drinks, but the hours are absurd and the older gentleman that works there - as confirmed by other reviewers - is actually kind of unsettling. There's no warmth, no appreciation for your money, no smiles - hard not to take personally, but I see it's just a general demeanor or maybe a problem of his. Great location, but I'd love to see better operating hours and keep that guy away from paying customers if he can't improve his attitude.</Text>< Date>

This place has amazing service.
I had to order a ton of coffee for an event at the last minute, and not only were they happy to accommodate, but one of the staff members even helped me carry everything back to our office a block away.
Wonderful gents!</Text>

<Review>We've been coming here on and off for years, as we live just down the street. It's an adorable shop with a nice selection of food and drinks. The food has always been consistently good, whether it's the oatmeal or the bagel with lox. Their Americano is a tad blah for me but they do a nice job with their cappuccino. It would be nice if the owner made more of a point to "greet" patrons and maybe get to know them. We would most likely come more often if we felt like we had a relationship.< /Review></record>

I gave this coffee place another chance because it’s in my neighborhood and I like to support our local small businesses. The coffee is ok, not bad. The sandwiches and bagels not bad. What’s bad is the male owner. He may be prejudice or just down right rude. I’m not sure. I would like to support. I would like to recommend this coffee shop but I wouldn’t want him to give the same horrible customer service to my family and friends. Way too embarrassing.  He grabs our $ or credit cards right out of our hands. He never says thank you. He NEVER SMILES! My grandkids and I all order drinks, smoothies and a coffee mocha. It was around 11:00am. My grandson had brought his Subway sandwich in Evergreen coffee place and asked me if he could sit and eat his sandwich. The place had 2 -3 other guests sitting inside at the time and no one outside. The extremely rude owner...says to my 11 year old grandchild NO YOU CAN’T EAT THE SANDWICH IN HERE!! He literally kinda startled us. But because my grandson respects his elders he didn’t say a thing. I however did, I told him calmly, this is why I stopped coming here. He looked at me with a rude dead stare. We got our drinks and left. It will take a lot to go back again. There are far too many other places you can stop and eat and have a nice drink, with happy friendly people. Happy Holiday Mr Grinch< /review>

I filed my returns on 21st Feb and thought it would had been done. The best part is still I have not got my returns nor they know where exactly it is after 2 months. I called multiple times without getting a call back from them on the final status. Thanks to Covid-19 for adding to the confusion and delay.

Got my refund and got to know it was more because of COVID-19.</review>

<Review>I have been a patient at Beverly Hills Dermatology Consultants, seen by both Dr Bussell and her team of nurses and PAs, for several years.  They have been outstanding in their medical and cosmetic treatment — professional, warm, helpful in every way, and informed about all the latest developments. They have been vigilant about monitoring my skin’s response to the sun, and have used a practiced eye to provide subtle but effective fillers and Botox where it’s been needed.
I actually look forward to seeing Dr Bussell and her crew!< /Review>< time>

There are plenty of dermatological practices  to choose from in Beverly Hills, but the one to book an appointment with is that of Dr. BUSSELL’s.  She’s one of the top doctors in her field and the medical expertise of her staff is matched by their attention to patient comfort and aftercare. This is one doctor’s office anyone could look forward to being in. And considering how the sun beats down us in LA, a visit with the dr. might just save your life.  It did mine.</Text>

I was referred to Beverly Hills Dermatology Consultants by a friend. I was very pleased with the consultation and care that I received. From initial consultation, minor surgery and follow up visits, Dr. Bussell and her remarkable team were attentive and thorough. I am very impressed with the entire front and back office operation. Highly efficient. Most importantly, Dr. Bussell delivers on all fronts. I’m constantly complimented on my skin’s improvement. I’m thrilled!!< /text>

<text>With approximately 40 years skin care by Dr. B., including several Mohs surgeries for skin cancer, skin peels, etc., this serves to vouch for Dr. B's and her staff's professionalism, skill, conservative medical approach, and obvious concern for the patient. Unquestionably, tops among all dermatologists. Five stars plus!</text>< pics>

<user>103104149155552701098<//user><Review>Hands down 5 stars. From the moment you walk in you are met with exceptional customer service. In the past I haven't had amazing experiences dealing with doctors but here I felt very comfortable. I believe they set a new standard for the medical world in terms of efficiency, quality care and making you feel like part of the family.
I met with Dr.Bussell (nicest woman is the world) and discussed a couple issues I have been having with a mole that seemed very dark. She reassured me I'm not dying and just to come in every now and then for a check up. I would highly recommend to friends and family!< /Review></record>

I absolutely love this place!  I am almost always seen pretty with little wait time, which is perfect for those with busy schedules. Dr. Bussell's products are amazing! Her anti-wrinkle cream, sunscreen, and antibacterial wash make great gifts for friends and family. This office always makes me feel welcome when I am here, rather than trying to get me out of the door quickly. They really care about their patients and make them feel taken care of. I would recommend this office to any close friend of mine, which says a lot! Not to mention they usually offer an awesome special on cosmetics and products towards the end of the year (perfect for the holidays!)< /review>

My skin is generally clear but I do have minor acne that appears during stressful stretches of life. The first thing I came in for was a chemical peel where a medical assistant named Chantal gave me the peel that left my face feeling crisp almost instantly and much clearer a few days later. I also have a oilier forehead and was recommended a toner product from the staff which IMMENSELY decreased any shininess and now helps me feel more confident. Visiting this clinic has been a great experience as the staff are knowledgeable and helpful with my skin needs.<//Review>

The staff over at BH Dermatology has done it again. I came in again to get a few more moles removed, and wouldn't ya know it, they took em right off of me with ease and I barely felt a thing! Again, I was concerned that a larger mole would leave a big scar, but Crystal is the best of the best in her field so after a few follow up treatments, the scarring is hardly noticeable! The staff is always so nice and helpful! I've been going for about two years now and I will continue to do so. This is the best dermatology clinic I have EVER been to, bar none.< /review>

< Review>
I've had a really rough journey with my skin care - even after a round of accutane, I still struggled with breakouts and a lot of the products I bought would only work for a limited time. I like that this office has a line of products that actually work for me and it's become a pretty simple regimen to follow and keep up with. It's really helped and I've seen a noticeable difference in the time that I started coming here. And I love free coffee and cookies in the waiting room!< /Review>

The staff was SO professional and welcoming. They performed a skin peel on my face, which made my face feel the best it has ever and lasted for so long! They also gave me multiple great products that have cleared up my face drastically. Their antibacterial soap I have been using for years and it continues to work like magic. The office was very clean and service was personal, yet quick! Couldn't have asked for a better dermatologist office!< /review>

<Review>I went here for Botox after recently moving to LA and to say I was disappointed was an understatement. You don’t purchase per unit, they have you buy a syringe, which comes out to $22.50 per unit. I have been getting Botox for 10 years and never have I seen a price so high. I didn’t realize what I had paid per unit until the next day so I called to speak with the manager about the huge price discrepancy. She told me that I obviously can not afford the $406 (which is not true, none of her business, and beyond condescending; I should have gotten almost twice as much Botox for the amount of money I spent). She asked what she could do to fix the problem and I said to credit my card back $150 or give me more Botox. She said no to both. They also charge for an office visit and do not take Brilliant Distinctions, which made the visit even more expensive. I hung up the phone upset and she said she would check with the doctor to see how they could fix this. She called me back and said they’ll mail me a check for $40 if I promise to never return to their office again. Rude, condescending, and don’t value their customers at all. Please never get Botox or any other treatments here for that matter.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2bc0807d5d42f:0xf3388f74ff0b3b1d< /gmapID><Date>1571082143344<//Date></record>

<text>I spent majority if not all of my teenage years with awful and painful cystic breakouts around my chin area. Unfortunately since I am a picker I believed that it was my fault and didn't go to a dermatologist for years. After years of no improvement I was fed up and went to a dermatologist in my hometown. He prescribed me a topical solution that was so strong I couldn't smile without being in excruciating pain & my skin breaking. I then came to Beverly Hills Dermatology once I moved out to LA & I was blown away. The PA's were so knowledgeable and put me on an mild but effective acne regimen right away & walked me through the type of acne I had. It turns out that my breakouts were hormonal and needed a daily oral medication. It's been about 1.5 years now and my skin is looking better than it ever has, I really don't know what I would do without this amazing staff!< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<review>I am thrilled my girlfriend told me to come here! Who would have thought that I would like somebody pampering my skin, but it really was a great experience, the best! I got treated as if I were in a European spa. Not only did they take great care of my face, my sun damaged hands got a work-over. Much to my surprise, what they did worked wonders for my skin. I guess I'll have to keep my girlfriend around for a while.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2bc0807d5d42f:0xf3388f74ff0b3b1d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>From the moment I turned onto N.Camben I was happily surprised to find that the practice is conveniently located near severely public parking lots. Being Beverly Hills it is typically difficult to find parking.
Going upstairs I was greeted by the most friendly staff I have ever encountered! The front desk was so helpful and eager to make me feel as comfortable as I possibly could while offering fresh coffee and cookies in the waiting area.
Seeing Paulina To who had the greatest go-getter attitude about getting rid of my blemishes. She gave me all the information I needed and more on how to clear my skin. After my first peel I noticed results! And using the Dr. Bussell's antibacterial soap as well it worked wonders! I couldn't be more grateful to have found them!
A big thank you!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>Dr Bussell has helped my skin tremendously! First when I lived in LA, she cleared up my acne with her products and applying cipro topically. I listened to everything she said to do and her advice helped instantly. When I moved to Miami, I wasn’t able to find another Dermatologist like her so on my last visit to LA, I had to see her, and again her products and direction, stopped my breakouts. I have never been to a Dermatologist who took a culture of my pimple and tested it to see which treatment would be effective. I also haven’t been to another Dermatologist who has created his/her own products.  Dr Bussell’s products have been more effective for me than all those high priced brands that all the Dermatologists sell. Because of her, I wish I still live in LA!

Also, Elise, her PA is very friendly, personable and just nice! She answers all my questions and concerns when I call her or leave an email for the office.

Lastly, all the staff are very friendly and professional from check-in to check-out. Her office doesn’t overcharge for products nor services. Every office I’ve been to in Miami charges a lot more and they’re not that great and efficient!  Even the accounting office called me to let me know they’re crediting my card as my insurance reimbursed them and they mailed me the credit receipt with the breakdown of charges.

I can’t say enough great things about this business and I rarely write reviews. This is one review that’s so worth my effort and time!

Keep up the excellent work!!!<//review><GmapID>0x80c2bc0807d5d42f:0xf3388f74ff0b3b1d<//GmapID><Rate>5</Rate>< Pictures>

<review>Thank God for this office!   Who thought there was one place to go that could give me clear skin,  diminish wrinkles, remove ugly spots that were on the verge of being cancerous AND help me take 2 inches off of my waist ( the result of SculpSure).
The staff is very knowledgeable and extremely friendly.   I have referred friends  and family members there and they all  have had the same positive experience.

Thank you Dr. Bussell

<Text>Beverly Hills Dermatology Consultants have been absolutely amazing for me.  Not only have they taken care of every single little problem I have had but also when I just need a boost due to me getting older they have offered solutions (Botox, and various fillers) to make me feel better about myself and never once have I felt they wanted me to do a procedure unless I felt comfortable with it.  The latest procedure I just did was called the "Button" procedure...because I needed more than a "2 stitch" face lift..  It literally was so easy and took maybe 1 hour in and out..and I drove myself there and home...I wish I was able to post pictures but I cant seem to figure out how here in this review.  I feel so great about my againg process because it did exactly what I needed...It was like a refresh on my neck and sides of my face....i no longer look like I have weights pulling my skin down.  I highly recommend this dermatology office!!! Every single person who works for Dr. Bussell is knowledgeable but also they actually care about everyones individual needs...and that's a rare combination in my opinion</Text>< pictures>

A good friend recommended me to Dr Bussell five years ago, and I am happy she did! I trust Dr Bussell's dermatology expertise and have never had to look elsewhere. Dr Bussell also has a lovely bedside manner - calm, helpful, and friendly. I always look forward to seeing Dr Bussell. If you're seeking a dermatologist, I would recommend giving Beverly Hills Dermatology Consultants a try.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Review>Dear Dr. Bussell,

Many businesses like to claim that they offer good customer service.  Many health-care providers tout the superiority of their treatments.  Often they actually advertise these.  Too often, though, these claims are questionable at best.  Sometimes their "customer service" is entirely non-existent.

In the field of health-care providers, traits such as carelessness, indifference or incompetence can cause results which are heartbreaking (or worse).

Some patients, if they feel they've been treated shabbily, will say nothing.  Others will protest and complain loudly.

My personality is such that I have no problem expressing myself if I feel that I've been treated poorly.  However, I consider myself a fair-minded person.  Therefore, it's only reasonable and fair that, when I've been well-treated, my praise should be forthcoming to those individuals who are unusually excellent.

It's for this reason that I want to mention you, Dr. Bussell, and your PA Crystal Coatney, for inclusion in the small category of those who offer exceptional patient care, ensuring high quality results.

I'm not a demanding individual and I try not to be a bother when at your office.  If, though, I have an occasional problem Crystal is someone with whom I can consult knowing she has always been helpful.

Her competence is beyond question.  Moreover, her manner is always pleasant.  She may be having a difficult day but, if so, this never shows in her attitude.  She even laughs at my (usually lame) attempts at humor!

I suspect you're aware of how capable she is but I would be remiss not to mention what a mental comfort it is knowing I'm in "good hands" with her.  All in all, Crystal is a true asset to your practice.

But this is true of the entire staff.  I've been your patient for a long time and I've dealt with nearly everyone.  The office staff is uniformly friendly and professional.  The PA's and others administering treatment are excellent.

Finally, Dr. Bussell, my highest praise is reserved for you.  There aren't enough superlatives to describe your talents.  Your technical medical skills are of the highest caliber.  Your personality is both caring and reassuring.  You should be deservedly proud of the exceptional quality of the care you give.  I offer this not as flattery but simply as a statement of fact.

I can, without any reservations, recommend your office to anyone needing dermatological treatment.  And I have.

Sincerely,

Joel Mogul</Review></record>

<review>This is a wonderful clinic that delivers excellent patient care. I feel very comfortable with the physician, Dr. Bussell, as well as the physician assistants. They are all very knowledgeable and relateable practitioners. The Medical Assistants are also very friendly and efficient. On several occasions, they have gone out of their way to assist and make me more comfortable. I also greatly appreciate the front desk for they are very knowledgeable with my insurance and are time efficient- making my visit an easy "in and out" experience. I'm grateful for this office and how they have worked with me to clear up the uneven texture  of my skin. I highly recommend the TCA peels for anyone who also has suffered from this problem.<//review>< pictures>

I wrote a bad review, However after talking to Dr Bussell she had explain to me all the procedures that they have done i now understand the charges and totally agree with her.
Please note that Dr Bussell is a very nice honest and professional Dr, and i will recommend her to all my friends and family for any check ups or skin problems.
If you have any problems understanding the charges from Dr Bussell office i do recommend to call them, and they will explain to you.
From now on i will only call Dr Bussell if i ever needs any skin check up.
Thank you again for all the information you have provided me.< /Review>

Great office with professional and friendly staff. I've struggled with adult acne and even tried accutane but I kept having breakouts. Since I've been coming here, my skin has really improved and I hardly break out anymore! Glad I found a place that produces real results.<//text>

Greatest skin care experience and most skilled dermatologist in Beverly Hills! After teenage years and my early twenties spent in the Los Angeles sun, I started to get aging skin and sun damage which I really began to notice recently. I only go by referral so I found Beverly Hills Dermatology Consultants, recommended to me by colleagues as the best skin care clinic in the city. I say from experience that they live up to their reputation. The doctor and PAs are incredible and got me great results relatively quickly (with both in office and at home treatments). What I once thought was hopelessly freckled and sun damaged skin is now looking newer, frsher and younger, thanks to Dr. Bussell and her staff.< /Review>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>I love getting peels & botox, I mean you really can't go wrong with any of the MA's or PA's and did I mention that Dr. Bussell is such a sweetheart. They are so genuinely concerned about doing a great job and giving you the results that you would want from a dermatologist clinic. (Plus the staffs good looks never hurt anyone!) This is honestly the first office that makes me feel appreciated, the girls are so professional and caring all the way from billing to management.</Text>< user_name>

I have been a patient at Beverly Hills Dermatology Consultants for over 30 years! It is the perfect one stop shopping for all your skincare needs, ranging from  excellent medical care by Dr. Bussell, to state of the art rejuvenating procedures by 'Dr. Bussell and her expert physician assistants. I also love her skin care products!  I use her anti-baterial liquid soap, multivitamin moisturizing cream, and her (non-greasy) sunblock. DR. Bussell is an exceptional doctor-  very  knowledgeable, compassionate, and available. Her office staff is always courteous, friendly , and helpful.  The exam rooms are immaculate, and the waiting room is a pleasure- always stoked with coffee, tea, and even cookies.
I have referred many friends to her, and everyone is extremely satisfied.</review>

<Text>Total scam ! The most dishonest people in town who abuse clients and the healthcare system.

I came to this office to have them look at my pimple and they billed my insurance for two surgical interventions. They billed insurance for over 400$ while my procedure was 25$ and they wanted to make me responsible for paying the rest while being totally comfortable to committing the fraud. When I called them out on insurance fraud and medical unethical malpractice, they showed aggressive and disrespectful behavior by asking for money. They lied to me, manipulated medical system and never accepted to reverse charged. They were harassing me every day by calling with unknown number and begging for money. The office manager were sending me adviced on medical treatement while she is not a practicing physician which is totally illega. This office have no respect for people. This place is total scam who try to rip you off as well as insurance.
Please double check what they bill your insurance for and you ll see over charged because that's how they make money behind your back. Stay away and find another dermatologist who is transparent about their practice and patients. Never come here again because behind their fake smiles and nice attitude with coffe-cookies service hides huge financial scam and American healthcare abuse.</Text><rating>1< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1475020139866</Time><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I love this practice.  I recommend a lot of my friends and family to this place.  The girls that work there are super kind and lovely.  They always have a smile on their faces.  I'm not sure why there are some bad reviews, but it looks like it's because of billing concerns.  My insurance is not covered at this office, so I just pay cash prices up front, so with that, I have no insurance problems to deal with.  They tell me how much everything will be before I'm seen.  No issues there!

I did CosmoPen there and I have definitely seen results.  I had a lot of divots on my cheeks and after only one treatment, it has minimized dramatically.  NOT KIDDING.  I've been getting compliments left and right.  I hadn't seen my mom in a few weeks and when I saw her after the treatment, she asked "What foundation are you wearing because your skin look so good."  I told her that I hadn't changed foundations at all and that it was just from one session of CosmoPen.  I recently went back and did it again. I've already seen such great improvement.

There is a downside though to the CosmoPen... it really hurts.  But they put some numbing cream on me.  However, it was still pretty painful on my forehead.  Just warning you.

The doctor or nurse lady who performed the treatment on me was super nice and even with me tearing up from the pain, she made me feel super comfortable.  One of the medical assistants even held by hand.  Haha!  Everyone's super sweet.

Parking is great.  I usually park at valet on Floor A because the office validates for 45 minutes.  But sometimes I just park across the street for public parking - 1 hour free.  Around the corner, there's 2 hour free public parking structures, too.</Review>< Pics>

I've had acne all my life. I've tried actuane and facials at medi spas but nothing seemed to work. One of my friends recommended me to go see Dr. Bussell and I'm so happy with the results! Not only did her products clear up my skin, but the staff was so helpful and friendly! During my initial visit I was able to see Dr. Bussell and I could not believe how nice she is! Most doctors won't even spend 2 minutes talking to their patients, but Dr. Bussell actually explained everything very thoroughly and we just had a great time chatting! You can tell that Dr. Bussell and her PAs really care about their patients and try their best to give the best patient care experience.< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I looked SO FABULOUS after having just one TCA chemical peel here that a colleague didn't even recognize me because she said I looked so much younger! My age spots, fine lines, irregular skin pigmentation and sun-damaged skin areas were greatly reduced after just one treatment! The staff was thorough, professional, intelligent, and very caring! They asked me throughout the procedure how I was doing and applied cooling agents on my skin to ease the burning. I also love Dr. Bussell's hydro/sal fade formula and anti-wrinkle cream; after years of using other creams, these are the best at keeping my skin youthful! I work at a major metroplitan art museum in leading presentations for large audiences, and I just want to thank Dr. Bussell and her highly competent PAs for helping me to feel confident about my appearance in an environment where aesthetics are valued!</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Checked it out this past weekend and had a great time! The owner, Gary, is a long-time home brewer with a commitment to quality beer. Not a bad one in the bunch. My favorites were the lager and IPA #002. Friendly staff, chill atmosphere and great-tasting beer. I'll be back soon!</Text>

this has been one of my favorite spots in all of the LA area. i've been here when it's busy, empty afternoon or right before closing. they are top notch when looking for an IPA or stout. it might be a bit difficult to find because of the surrounding area but once you do, i'm sure you'll be coming back time and time again like me.</text>

Solid beers, with NEIPA hazy available. Good service, say hello to the owner - great guy and artist. They just started serving a double hazy made from el dorado hops and a delicious addition of watermelon. Great local brewery.<//Review>

I really like the beer. It's much better than Mt. Lowe or Pacific Plate. Place is a little small, but I am sure it will get bigger with time.< /Text>

Hop Secret stands out among any of the newer breweries in the area. It certainly holds its own with some well received established brewers in wider L.A.

Another plus it's a thirty second walk from the Monrovia Goldline station. A perfect start and stop to Pacific Plate and the new Wingwalker breweries via Goldline. All walking distance.

Santé!</text>

It's a cosy little store with friendly employees. Quick service and prices are avarage. Only down fall I would have to say is the gas pumps don't have pay at the pump. Makes it alot of work when you have to go back and worth in the store to the pump then back inside back to your car. Otherwise I would recommend this store if you like friendly caring owners management and employees wrapped in a smaller comfortable setting...</Text>

This quaint little market is in an unknown area of Oakland. They have an excellent and diverse selection of pastries, produce, beverages, deli, packaged goods and pretty much anything you could need. The prices are high, but the location is a bit obscure so it is kind of a funny little place. Parking is super easy, they have a lot of spaces right outside. They also have four tables to sit out should you choose to sit outside and enjoy something you purchased.</text>

<review>Friendly staff for the most part. Lots of great stuff. If you visit Hot Bar do it early in the day. It's not replenished enough & food gets over cooked from sitting. I made that mistake twice & had to throw it out..and it's NOT cheap!  Everything though is WAY over priced. Expect to pay 2 1/2 times more then any other market. Also, 3 times now I've purchased out dated food!!! Watch out for there pre made & packed fresh"supposedly" fesh foods! Sandwiches in particular.</review>< gmapID>

Friendly staff, nice selection  in every category for a neighborhood grocer.   Tasty BBQ.  Our go to when we need a quick bite, wine,  or a missing ingredient in a pinch.  A little pricey for all your shopping.<//text>

Really like the bbq to order and meat counter - excellent marinated meats, fish. Good produce, nice cheese and wine selection. I can get everything I want on a shopping run here. But really, it is the bbq and meat counter that make this market shine.< /text>

This market has excellent fresh fruit and meat. There is a salad bar as well.All the

selections are high quality.Staff helpful and pleasant.My only caveat is that it is expensive....perhaps because they are located in a high rent district.Not a place to buy ordinary staples but for special occasions it is perfect.</Review>

Good, but pricey, neighborhood market.  The lady in front of me was shocked when her two carts of alcohol and snacks for a party was $700. Great place for snacks.< /text>

This company is the worst place I ever worked for. Management are rude and seem to treat you nice, but behind your back they are talking about you. The owner is very special and hired me just for the holidays after hoildays were over he fired me without giving me a reason. I think it was very unethical and very unprofessional of him to do that. Also some of his employees that been there for a very long time are stealing from him, but yet he still has them working for him. Once again this is one of the worst companys to work for they just use you and when they don't need you, you get fired. DONT WORK FOR THEM< /text>

I am happy to have the Village Market: they have a bunch of hard-to-find items in their compact shop: hot soups and other ready-to-eat items; fresh BBQ on the weekend; a British foods section; Propane gas exchange; organic produce; butcher; tasty baked goods.   Their prices are higher but so is the quality.   The staff is friendly.  They often have 10-20¢ mini avocados.< /text>

The first:  I was amazed at the quality of foods and meats available there.  I had no idea they would carry such quality like grass fed and organic everything!  The second surprise:  it is definitely more expensive than Whole Foods.  The part that keeps me coming back is the service.  I am hoping the extra money we spend there goes to the workers because they are worth it.<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Village Market in the Broadway Terrace neighborhood is so amazing for a small market. You walk in to samples galore, several different types of cheeses and crackers, guacamole, several salsas and the tortilla chip of the day....sometimes even a locally made cake or two. Seriously, one of the best local produce markets in Oakland and on weekends, a bbq including pork ribs, tri tip and chicken. Worth the trip from anywhere in Oakland, vote with your fork and buy local at Village Market!﻿<//Text><date>1407290824776<//date>< rate>

If you could provide me us with the day and approximate time you were in the store that would be helpful.  Also the employees name.  We do not currently have an employee in our meat department named Francisco.\n\nThanks again for the review.  I look forward to addressing this issue together!\n\nRegards,\n\nKeith Trimble\nOwner'}</resp>

Not the best choice for refilling your vehicle. When I went there it was completely packed, which is surprising considering how expensive the prices are at almost 4 dollars per gallon of gasoline. I paid for about 40 dollars of gasoline and it stopped filling at the $35 dollar mark, waste of money and time. I would advise not choosing this gas station over any other one unless you want your money and time wasted.</review>

I don't usually go into the shop, but the times I have, it has seemed clean and the people friendly. It tends to have some of the lowest prices in our neighborhood, which I really appreciate.</Review>

The assistant manager demanded to see both my id and the person purchasing the beer in order to sale her the beer. I found that illegal.

<review>First time there!!! I paid my registration fees at the kiosk but was told I need a smog. Went to Smog Hut without an appointment and met Joe. Who started immediately and said it would be about 15mins. We walked across the street to La Victoria's, got some lunch and when we came back Hugo told me with a smile it's passing 😄  I could have gotten a smog check somewhere else for less money but I was also given my 2021 sticker right there!!!! Winner, winner, chicken dinner!!!! Thanks Hugo and Joe!!! Top notch customer service!!!!!<//review><gmap_id>0x808fcb889ffe6ffb:0x2cd8f7bd17707ad7</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This place was great!! The employees were super nice and helpful. I had called the morning of just to check if an appointment was needed (no appointment needed) I arrived later that day around 4pm and my car was in cue for a few minutes and the smog check itself was about 10-15 minutes. I also got my registration renewed here. Prices are great here. Highly recommend them!<//review>

After having a terrible time attempting to register from out-of-state for the first time at the DMV and failing to get any help, I took a chance on Smog Hut and I’m so glad I did. In and out in 20 minutes, very kind and even put the plates on. Absolutely worth the extra fee just to get it all done in one place, stress-free. I’ll definitely be back! :) Thank you guys so much again!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This is a good place to get all your requirements about smog and registration.

Smog check was around 50$ which I think has gone expensive all around.

Registration on spot was 30$- which I did not take as it seemed expensive to me and would just wait for dmv to send me the same.<//Text>

I dropped in on a Wednesday morning without an appointment.  Even though they were working on two cars ahead of me, I was in and out in 20 minutes.  Prices are reasonable, especially with the discount provided on their website.  The two people I talked to there (probably the owners? I don't know) were polite and pleasant.< /review>

Great service and location. It's nearby my work and only took about 8 minutes to get there. My car was serviced immediately only took about 20 minutes. I was able to grab lunch and get my car serviced all during my lunch hour. Great customer service. Highly recommended!<//Review>

Call in earlier to get a recommended time in so I dont need to wait. In fact, he has two spots in the shop. So i arrived a little early but was greeted into the check point right away.  Then everything else is just as great as other reviews!  In and out 15 minutes, great job!</text>

Preet was affable and extremely helpful in getting my smog certificate -- he helped me out to diagnose why my car's check engine light was on, and once that was addressed he kindly ran the test. There was no line and I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. I would give him more stars, but Google taps out at 5 -- highly recommended!<//Review>

Jokes aside though, Preet and the gentleman helping at the front desk were both very friendly and got my late registration fees taken care of within 5 minutes. I absolutely will never step near a DMV again for registration. Smog Hut Star Station just earned a customer for life.</Review>< gmap_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Super fast, friendly. My older car requires a Star SMOG Test. Over the phone this shop quoted me a better price than other places within a similar driving radius from north DTSJ. They charged me the quoted amount, which was consistent with their website's schedule of prices. I needed to replace a gas cap; they showed me why and directed me to the parts store 100 yards away, and said they'd wait while I bought the part. Bonuses: sits cater-corner to a newer La Victoria Taqueria and a bowling alley, and (as mentioned) within quick walking distance of an auto parts store.< /text>< resp>

Smog Hut makes getting a smog quick and enjoyable. Yes, you heard that right, enjoyable. Preet and his teammate are an amazing duo and they are the best at getting the job done efficiently.

I brought in my car to get smogged, and I was warmly greeted and was immediately provided service. As I waited in the wait room, there were other cars that completed smog. Those that passed were issued a pass cert, and those that failed, Preet explained in a professional and friendly manner on what occurred.

As a bonus, you can get your tags immediately if you request the service, which is an additional charge, before the smog.

Overall, I highly recommend Smog Hut for their super friendly service. I will be back in 2 years time.</text>

<Text>Best smog place I've been to for all my vehicles. Used to go to random spots and had hit/miss experiences. Preet (I think his name is) is easy to work with and no hassle. Usually it is really quick as well! He told me he was also doing DMV paperwork now so this I will definitely be going there instead of trying to get an appointment at the DMV.

The waiting room isn't very exciting but with his quick service you won't be spending much time in it.</Text>< user>

< Review>
Very nice and friendly staff and great service. I visited on Saturday for smog check and out of state registration. No need for an appointment. It took me less than 30 minutes to finish all those. It would cost you forty or fifty bucks more than dmv but its service is worth the money. No need to wait in a long line in dmv and to deal with the sloth-like people in dmv.< /Review>

Exceptional service at the Smog Hut.  My car has its check engine light on and is sometimes a challenge to get through the test. Pri was an expert at guiding me through the process!

Thanks!< /Text>

<review>I did not have an actual appointment, I knew I should have; but even with that and having to wait for two other customers, my car was done in about one hour.
Not only fast but good customer service, I'll come back here again (with an appointment this time)...</review>< name>

I exchanged emails with Preet, along with a couple phone calls, in order to determine what I had to do for a brand new out of state vehicle purchase. He was super knowledgeable, extremely helpful, and knew exactly how to take care of my potentially unique situation. Getting in and out of his location's parking lot was easy (great for cars that are very low to the ground), and finding his shop wasn't hard either.

Preet was accommodating, helpful, and got me taken care of without a hassle. He also does VIN Verifications for out of state purchases, so it saved me a trip to the DMV, and a long wait in line.

He's also experienced with dealing with sports cars, super cars, exotics, etc., so that's yet another point in his favor as he's comfortable around such vehicles. Preet is my Go To guy for CA Smog -- I can't trust anyone else with my car(s).< /Text>

And bringing in my balky deadbolt saved me a $65 fee to fix it on site! I wouldn’t mind paying that fee if I had to, but so glad he mentioned that I could do it this way instead. I find deadbolt installation pretty easy, but locksmithing is beyond me...< /Review>< Pictures>

I lost my car keys on a Sunday and, as a commuter with work on Monday, was freaked out to say the least. Viva Zapata Lock & Key sent Eli to help me get into my car and he had a key cut for me within 20 minutes. Excellent service and incredible friendly, I definitely recommend if you are in a pinch!< /Text>

This place seems to run hot-and-cold for me.  I've gone in to this location and received incredible efficient and knowledgeable service and I've been there and gotten...eh....the other end of the spectrum.  If you know what you need, this store has very good selection (much as any other OfficeMax).  If you need store clerk assistance, count on getting either really good or really bad service based on my 10-15 visits to this location.</review>

<text>Amazing store with great staff, I came in as a business account member 3 hours from my hub. Ivy,and DJ spent 45 min on the phone with my account rep to get my inventory ordered online and "picked up in store" so that my personal card wouldn't be charged.
DJ and Ivy are the epitome of what outstanding customer service looks like!<//text>< Pics>

I was not greeted when coming in and had to seek out on 2 occasions counter and floor assistance. On my third attempt they finally sent someone with me to locate the item I was seeking.</Review>< pics>

Always seems to be an issue printing from emails they want you to sent it to them but they take on other projects as you are quickly emailing them your file. They should come up with a better way of letting customers print from their emails.<//Text>

I placed an online order with this store, and they took my payment. Within an hour, they cancelled the order on their own and did not refund me the money. When I spoke with customer service, they said "Talk to the store," when I talked to the store they said "We never took your payment," and when I told them I was staring at my bank statement which showed the payment they said, "we can't do anything about it."

They are liars, and thieves and I suggest you never go near them.<//Review>

< Review>
Linda Betsekas of Print Services won my great respect in recent days as I twice observed her working efficiently on job orders all under the pressure of the watchful eyes of a handful of customers in the que. But impotantly she acknowledged each waiting patron promptly with a smile and then they did not seem to mind the short wait to be served. My jobs amounted to printing out $1.32 worth of return mailing labels. The process was enough to confuse me thoroughly, but in a few minutes Linda had my requests printed-out. Soon I was a happy camper back in the traffic. She treated me as if I had brought in a $500 undertaking. So thank you Linda. Our last names are noticeably similar, but Linda's is Greek and mine is Lithuanian!!!

By far the best place to go for fresh produce. This store never disappoints. The associates are always helpful and kind. I always find what I need when I go in.<//Text>

Love Sprouts! The bulk items are great and the produce selection is very nice. Just know that the produce is usually actually ripe, so don't expect it to last very long. Very nice staff too!</review>

<Review>Love sprouts, great prices, good selection, helpful employees, good variety of produce especially when it comes to berries which cost 2 to 3 times more and Raleys or Safeway.

Plus their Deli employees are actually happy to work there. Great service at all locations.</Review>< date>

<Review>O Sprouts, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...  So not only is the store always immaculate, the customer service is without fail consistently perfect, shelves beautifully stocked  and to top it all off... Their prices for fruits & veggies rival Walmart with their quality far exceeding even Whole Foods..  I highly suggest joining their online program & download the app to your phone, the deals they send are amazing😁<//Review>< gmapID>

The ONLY reason I like to go to Sprouts Market.  [ Their Bakery Area ] : I LOVE their PISTACHIO MUFFINS !  [ And the PISTACHIO Muffins are extremely hard to find ] !!! + Their affordable FRESH Fruits.< /Review>

A lively strip mall with lots of options from Sprouts to Dos Coyotes, it's popular among the denizens of Roseville. One star down for the somewhat awkward parking lot.< /review>

I have to say that there's a lot of little fun things you can do in this little Rocky ridge Town so if you happen to be in the area take some time and walk around this is a nice little shopping with plenty of different variety of stores< /Text>

I didn’t goto Dos Coyotes / Jamba / or Sprouts (lives here 20+ year) until Volta ;) smart choice vs waste competitors like Charge Point charging more than my own electric company ;) need to add two more !
