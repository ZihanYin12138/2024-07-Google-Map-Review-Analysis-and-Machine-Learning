<Review>We had to bring our cat due to emergency twice to this office. One time in 2019 and second time just recently in 2021. Both times the admin staff was polite. The doctor is very knowledgeable and has a great way of explaining things. I highly recommend this office.< /Review>< Pictures>

I am very grateful to the Doctor for the surgery he did to my Luna. You have saved the life of my dear Yorkie and her baby. Your prices are the main factor that saved them! God bless everyone who works there.< /text>

Consistently on point service for both my cats. What I like about the staff and the way this business is run is that they always answer the phone and are accessible to answer questions and concerns. They also make recommdations about care and treatments for my cats without being pushy.<//Review>

<review>Their prices are better than most places we called. I feel their quality and customer service has improved. The vet did an excellent job on our pups spay. Treated her with care. Be warned they have free roaming cats in the lobby and if you have a reactive animal let them know.< /review>< pics>

They are very nice & caring here & have your pets best interest in mind.  They don't gouge you price was either which is a good change from what I'm used to.  Several of our friends have started going here & love it as well.  Try them out!< /text>

I have recommended Dr. Lehil and his practice to many neighbors and friends.  We have had nothing but great experiences with him and his staff. They do not push for unnecessary tests or procedures, are honest, and have always shown compassion towards their furry clients. Dr. Lehil makes sure to stay up to date on current research and is always willing to listed to the pet parents and answer questions. Additionally, the prices are reasonable and I really feel as if they are in it for the love of the animals and not for the filling of their pocketbook. It is awful when you have to 2nd guess whether or not to take your pet in to the vet due to cost, yet I have never felt this way here.</text>

<Review>This new Veternary, 2 1/2 years old is extremely well organized and well staffed.  The vet is extremely responsive and went to great lengths to explain his service.
During this Covid situation, the staff are extremely well organized and know their jobs and do them very well.
I don’t often recommend veterinarians, but the service I got was very efficient and terrific with my two dogs.  I’ll be going back.  I think you’ll be very happy with their service!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I absolutely love this Veterinary Clinic. I will never take my Chihuahuas anywhere else again. They genuinely love and care about the animals and are kind and will work with you. Their prices are reasonable and you can tell that they genuinely care more about the animals than they do making money. My little girl Chihuahua is anxious about any strangers but she loved the vet here and just hopped right into his arms and was calm and comfortable the whole time. He took really good care of them. I'm so grateful I found this vet.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Dr. Lehil is the best vet in Roseville. Not only is he extremely knowledgeable, but he also cares about your pet. He never treats my cats like just another number. I am extremely grateful for the excellent care that all of my animals have received here. Dry Creek Vet is always clean and well kept. The staff is always helpful and friendly. Seriously, I cannot recommend this establishment enough.<//Review>< Time>

This is who you want to take your dog or cat to.  These people are dedicated and compassionate, empathetic of your feelings--all that and reasonably priced as well.  Dr Lehil frankly laid out the prognosis and all our options and kept in touch with us.  And even though we lost our pet, I had total confidence in his ability to assess the situation and yet comply with our wishes.  And his staff loved on our pet when we entrusted her to their care.  I am very, very impressed with this vet practice.  Deserves 5 stars and more.</Review>

We recently had to put down one of our dogs who had been with us for 13 years. I feel so fortunate that we had a place like this to help us through one of the toughest times in our lives. The staff is compassionate and honest and made a very difficult day a lot easier on us all. Highly recommend them, especially if it's time to say goodbye to your pet.<//review>

<review>Dr. Lehil is the absolute best. My dog, Drax, has been coming to this vet for about a year. As a new dog owner, I have had several firsts with my baby boy and Dr. Lehil has exhibited nothing but professionalism and quality care. He is the most trustworthy vet and I am so thankful to have him take care of my baby.

Outstanding, caring veterinary office, from Alex at the desk, to Brian the assistant, to the Doc.  I was able to get an emergency appointment on a Sunday to help my senior loving companion over the rainbow bridge.  Alex was very kind on the telephone and found me a slot before closing, Brian the assistant was caring and compassionate.  The Doc was very kind, genuine and very sensitive to our feelings.  No one rushed us.  We are in Grass Valley, but I will use this office when my regular vet is retired or unavailable.  They deserve 10 stars for being so kind during this very sad time.  The office is also very clean and pleasant. Thank you Alex, Brian & Dr.!< /Text>

<text>I'm so happy we found this office! The doctor and staff are very professional and caring.  They really took extra time to ensure our little guy was going to be okay.  They thoroughly communicated what was going on with him and how to care for him at home and to give a call if we had any more questions or concerns. And set up the next step in his care before we left. They were gentle and took they're time making sure our little guy felt as comfortable as possible. The wait time wasn't bad at all. They have a good size waiting room and offer good coffee and light snack while you wait.  They have two support kitties that the office was kind enough to adopt to assure that their specific needs are cared for.  One has a bad leg and the other has a mass in his jaw. You know these little guys are being well cared for because they are so friendly and come right out to say hello.  We will definitely be going back!!!<//text></record>

Dr. Lehil is absolutely the best! We have been bringing our animals to him for years. We even followed him when he moved to this current location. It may be an extra 15 minutes out of our way but it's worth the drive for the care he provides.</review>

Love the care and so does my dog. Dr is very compassionate. Dr. Is kind and humble and calms my high anxiety 10 yr old pom.  Dr is truly about the care for our fur babies.  He is a one of a kind Dr....the office staff got us in asap to address an ear problem. Followup went perfect and treatment was accomplished in 10 days.  I am grateful for dr' s care and most least evasive treatment first.  Happy campers for all of us !!</Text>

<Text>I've been taking my cat and dog here. They are old and dear, so I wanted compassion and ability. I'm not disappointed. Everyone I've had contact with here has been above and beyond helpful. Prices are fair and the doc does not push unnecessary things. I love Dry Creek Vet. My elder pets are doing so much better than they were and what I'd expected.< /Text><gmap_id>0x809b21bde16fae4f:0xe4c6080eacfc21b5<//gmap_id>< Response>

We recently moved to the area and finding a vet was one of the first things on my to do list. So glad some of my friends in rescue recommended Dry Creek Veterinary Center. Dr. Lehil and his staff are wonderful to work with. What's important to me besides competence is compassion. And the team has both in large measure! Definitely recommend this practice.< /review>

Fast service (I got an appointment same day). Let me start by telling you I have been to many vets in the area and this is the very first one that I felt was not trying to up sell me like a car salesman. This was my first visit but I am definitely glad to have them close to home.< /Text>

Highly recommend this vet. I had to put my 14 year of dog to sleep this past March, I  had him cremated for a reasonable price and received the most Beautiful wood box with him name engraved on it plus a kind card with the tag that he was cremated with. I was so grateful💛< /text>

<review>The Doctor here is Amazing !  We found a 3 wk old orphaned kitten last week and had him on KMR & Gerber baby food (chicken/turkey) and he seemed to be doing well. However we noticed diarrhea+ blood. We called in the morning , they saw him at 1pm , they gave us antibiotics, dewormed him , with exam- was $59 I was literally in shock !!! What an amazing caring doctor who truly cares about animals. We hope to give Simba a fighting chance at a long life, we thank the staff for their care & compassion. We will be coming back with all our rescues. Office staff )Kristen a delight as well. I have not a single negative thing to say, 💯% recommend this place. You won't be sorry< /review>< pics>

Great new vet in town. Old-fashioned style he will talk directly with you about your treatment options, rather than had some shwa-shwa used car dealership approach where they pretend they don't know all the fees and send yet another assistant back with do a quote and then negotiate down. It was cute that the mourning Dove built her nest right in their sign space...and they didn't boot her out!<//review>

< Review>
We have been here with two of our dogs and have been extremely happy with both of their care. The staff and Dr. Lehil have been kind, knowledgeable, and gentle, and the cost has been very reasonable. We trust them completely and have nothing but great things to say! We’ve been particularly impressed by how good they are with nervous dogs; ours are usually super nervous, but were both instantly comfortable with Dr. Lehil’s demeanor. Would recommend to anyone looking for quality veterinary care!</Review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>Let me start by saying, I do NOT write online reviews- I'm just not that kind of gal. My 12.5 year old female boxer, and 8 year old female labrador, have been in my care since they were 6 weeks old- to say they're my children, would be an understatement. With that being said, I've lived all 30 years of my life in Austin, Texas and because of such, they've been seen by our "family vet" their entire lives, and in my opinion, and the opinion of my retired-vet grandfather, they've received the BEST care with that vet in Austin. Moving to Roseville, with my husband for his military career to continue here, was NERVE WRACKING, 90% due in part to my feelings about leaving my vet in Austin, with an older boxer, who's life only gets more complicated as time passes. With that being said, both of them today went under anesthesia for their routine teeth cleanings, and I was very impressed. Upon arriving at the clinic, I asked the vet tech if it was possible to keep the girls in a larger kennel together, both for their comfort and to prevent my labrador for unleashing her HUGE anxiety bark that rarely rears it's head- the lab tech told me that they didn't have any larger kennels, but that they had an office that rarely gets used, and she'd be happy to put down blankets and let them have their day in there, together. This immediately put me more at ease. After letting Dr. Lehil know how anxious I was, approximately 27x about my boxer's sedation, I left the girls there. After they were both done, Dr. Lehil called and let me know how their cleanings went, not only was the price comparable to what I am accustomed to back home (WHAT PLANET ARE THE REST OF THESE NORCAL VETS ON TO BE CHARGING UPWARDS OF $500 PER DOG- actual highway robbery), but he didn't do anything unnecessary and gave his honest opinion, which matched what I have been hearing back home about my boxer's overgrowth of gums, again, leaving me more comfortable. When I came to get the girls, they were in their "suite" recovering, I spent some time chatting with Dr. Lehil, who also acutely noticed that my labrador had yeast in her ears (story of her life), then loaded them up into the car. Before pulling away in the car, I noticed that my boxer still had her IV catheter in her arm. I went and inside and told the vet tech, who immediately took FULL responsibility and profusely apologized, and immediately remedied the situation, she was both appreciated this morning upon arriving (kennel to room situation) and upon taking responsibility for her oversight. I am VERY happy with my experience here and will be much more at ease over the next few years we will be in the area. Thank y'all <3< /text>< user_name>

< Review>
We as a family feel BEYOND BLESSED to have found this vet.  Our dogs are an extension of us and this office always makes us feel as though we are giving them the very best level of care possible.

The office is clean and inviting. The staff are friendly, helpful and welcoming.  Dr Lehil is absolutely a cut above the rest and believe me we have been through many lifetimes worth of veterinary experiences (pet hospitals, vet offices, Emergency clinics, shot clinics etc).

We have seen Dr Lehil for things as serious as a severe Mitral Valve disease diagnosis to your every day things like vaccines, as well as aesthetic stuff like moles and lipomas.  Every single situation, regardless of seriousness, he has provided the same level of phenomenal care.  We could not recommend this place enough.  Not only do we love him but our pets do too and let’s be honest here?  That’s the MOST important, amirite?<//Review>

Dr. Lehil and his staff are competent, thorough, and compassionate. Having moved to Roseville recently, we were facing the daunting task of finding a Veterinarian for our beloved pets. We are so glad that we stopped in to chat with the Doctor and his staff. Our pets' initial exams were the most thorough and informative that they have ever had.

If you are looking for a vet, Dr. Lehil is the best.

And his fees are very reasonable.

After having had several bad experiences with other dentists, I am so happy to say that Dr. Atkins and his staff are so kind and attentive! From calling to schedule an appointment to going in for my first visit, they were all so nice! During my visit, Dr. Atkins and his assistants were all attentive to what concerns I had and discussed further work that would need to be done and in doing so allowed me a space where I felt safe and heard. I am very grateful to have been recommended to their office and look forward to future visits and would highly recommend them as well!</text>

Half my tooth came off during flossing on Friday night. To say the least, I was concerned. I called Dr. Atkin’s office Saturday morning and got a number to call in case of an emergency, which I punched in. Dr. Atkins, himself, answered the call and arranged an appointment for me Monday morning. I showed up and was warmly greeted by the staff and directed to an office. I had saved my wayward tooth fragment and Dr. Atkins looked it over and thought he could save it, which he adroitly did after some minor cleaning up. I walked out of his office with a repaired tooth that felt like nothing unusual had occurred. Dr. Atkins is a gifted dentist with a sensitive and extremely experienced touch as an effective healer. I would recommend him, and his friendly and competent staff to anyone. He’s the best.</text>

First time at his office this week, was there 2 visits.  I’ve already recommended him to several family members. Dr. Atkins and his team are very welcoming & friendly.  They all made me feel at ease when having my work done. They will be my #1 ‘go to’.< /text>

<Time>1600640373646<//Time><rating>5<//rating><Review>Dr. Atkins was extremely thorough in his examinations, diagnosis and treatment.  He had images of my teeth from prior visits.  He showed me what needed to be treated right now,  which ones would be closely monitored and evaluated in the following months for signs of improvement or degradation.
Treatment was completely pain-free.  I was at ease and comfortably relaxed during the whole process.  It felt more like a spa appointment than a dental visit.  His staff was excellent as well.  Courteous and patient. I could not be happier.  Thank you.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Last week on Oct. 3rd, 2019 , I just visited Dr. Atkins for routine check up and cleaning. Kim, Hygienist, has been provided excellent care, as always. It was very nice to see Dr. Atkins and other staff with warmth greetings.

In the last 35 years, I visited about ten dentists and maybe ten times or less. I had been very fearful of visiting any dentist for dental care because of all the very bad experiences that I had. Since I visited Dr. Atkins and his staffs last month July 2018, those fears and bad experiences were gone. Now I found the best dentist and his team who will take care of every patient as best as their own family. If I found his office 35 years ago, I shouldn't have a lot of problem with my teeth now. Now I trust his team, and will schedule a lot appointment to maintain the health of my teeth. I wished that I met someone at my work who knew Dr. Atkins 30 years ago, and shared this experience with me. Please just try one visit, you will find out more than what I am saying here.

English is my second language. If my words, sentences, spellings and any grammar are not correct, please try to understand what I am trying to share with you.

I’ve been a patient of Doc. Atkins for over ten years now (since I was 10 years old!). He and his team are the nicest people. Dr. Atkins personalizes each visit, and he’s always excited to hear what’s new in my life.
I always get great care. My fillings and cleanings are quick and painless. And I always leave with a goody bag of toothpastes and brushes.< /Text>

<review>Dr. Atkins and his staff continue their excellent safety protocols in protecting patients and staff from Covid-19. I continue to be impressed by the precautions Dr. they all take to protect everyone’s health. Their COVID-19 protocols are superb and made me feel safe and comfortable. As always, my dental care was excellent. I had a chipped tooth that I asked to have filed, but after Dr. Atkins’ exam he identified two chipped teeth and recommended we build them up with filler for strength and longevity instead of filing them down further. I am really pleased with the results. He was able to do the painless procedure the same day, which I really appreciated.  Kim, the dental hygienist continues to be exceptional; she is thorough and gentle at the same time. I am so glad that Dr. Atkins is my dentist and I highly recommend him if you are looking for a dentist.</review>< user>

< review>
As a dental hygienist, I'm very picky about who I will let touch my teeth. I worked a temp day at Dr. Atkin's office in January of 2018 and saw his incredible work on his patients. I decided that day, if I ever have anything happen with my teeth, Dr. Atkins will be the #1 dentist I trust to do the work needed... and he will be doing the sealants on my son's teeth when they are ready. Side note - he is super loyal to his office staff and they to him, which is a very good sign as well. AND just because a DENTIST has good reviews on Yelp or elsewhere, that doesn’t always mean their quality of work is 5 stars as well, but Atkins deserves his stars for his demeanor and his craftsmanship in dentistry.

I started to have little twinges of concern on my right side upper and lower teeth, so I scheduled an exam and x-rays the week before and saw him yesterday. The office staff is super nice and they are taking all the COVID precautions. I love how the new patient comprehensive exam is allotted plenty of time in the schedule to do the health history paperwork, an initial meet and greet by the doctor, full mouth x-rays with the assistant (who did an excellent job and was mindful of the potential for tenderness in certain areas), Intraoral photos by the doctor, and a full explanation of the findings. Luckily, I know what I am looking at in the x-rays and photos, so that makes it easier on me, and them!

Even though I am not really looking forward to having my teeth cut, I feel so relieved and confident that Dr. Atkins will do an efficient and minimally invasive job on the restorations I need. I have recommended him to friends and family numerous times over the years since I worked that temp day to cover for his permanent hygienist (who used to be his assistant). He is excellent, and I hope he never retires!!! (I'm sure his staff feels the same about that too.)

Also, I do not live in Long Beach, but I feel that a good dentist is worth the drive for the peace of mind that comes with knowing that the bones in your mouth are cared for with the highest standard of patient care, quality craftsmanship, and ethical considerations. HE IS THE BEST!< /review>

Dr Don is a great dentist.  Knowledgeable and professional, he has his patients' interests and dental health as his top concern. That's as it should be for a good dentist.  His staff are also efficient, professional, and very helpful.  Dr. Don and his staff deserve an extra star.< /review>

I love Dr. Atkins and his whole staff!  They’re so conscientious, friendly and professional.  I’ve been a patient for several years, but you’re really made to feel like part of a family.  A few months back I had a dental emergency out of state. I called Dr. Atkins and he went above and beyond to ensure I was able to get the antibiotics I needed and set me up with a Endodontits for an immediate root canal when I returned home.  He also followed up to ensure that I was doing well.  His staff are all so nice, without exception. If you’re looking for an amazing and caring dental team for you and your family, look no further.  I highly recommend Dr. Atkins.< /text>

As always and as no coincidence, every time I’m @ Dr. Atkins for anything I get the greatest service by him and his staff! I’ve been their customer for more than 3 years now and this change I made to his office has definitely been my best option ever speaking of dentists. They make you feel welcome and as if you’re part of their family! They always treat you with respect and courtesy. Thanks a million Dr Don and stuff for being that wonderful!!!!

I had a sudden dental emergency. Dr. Atkins wasn't even my established dentist, but his staff arranged it so that they took me in immediately after I called and tended to my pain. Unfortunately I needed root canal, but Dr. Atkins said, "Let me make some calls," and within an hour I was in an endodontic chair having it done. Dr. Atkins goes above and beyond in his care for patients. I have now switched my dental care to his practice. I highly recommend this personable, knowledgeable, and very caring clinician. His staff are also caring and understanding of your needs. Your teeth deserve this office. Don't look up anyone else; he's the best.< /Text>

<review>Dr. Don has been my dentist for over 20, no 30! years.  I can attest to excellent care, with an eye towards preventing future problems from occurring.  The staff are very helpful and efficient.  I have recommended several friends to Dr. Atkins and have never heard a complaint.  Expect good jokes and great dentistry - got an extra star?<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Yes my name Clarence Charles Collins and a Viet Nam Veteran and retired from Disneyland due to a industrial accident at age 25. This has caused a hardship in my life. Dr Atkins heard of my problem and contacted me and offered to fixed my teeth at no charge. He also set me up with a oral surgeon and cordnated with his lab to donote inplants.In my 70 years i have never seen a dentist with a heart this big also if you are lucky enough to me his staff it as you.have known everbody for life. Dr Atkins takes care of his Veterns and the best demtist i seem in my 70 years. Please try DR Atkins you womt regret it also he works with a great oral surgeon DR Kim they are the best.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>{'time': 1580127485497, 'text': 'Thank you for the great review!

Dr. Atkins is the best!! I've recently moved to WA, but still consider Dr. Atkins my dentist. While in town last week, they were able to squeeze me in for a cleaning and check up.  If you are looking for a new dentist, please consider Dr. Atkins. You won't be sorry!</text>

<Review>If you are looking for a good Dentist then go no further. Every time I've gone in for any dental work Dr. Atkins has always taken the time to explain what he is doing to make it as comfortable of an experience as possible.
This is coming from a person who used to be terrified of going to the dentist, now I actually look forward to the visits. I know I'll get the work done that I need and not be worried.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

My family and I have been seeing Dr. Atkins for about 25 years. If ever one of us needed to see an out-of-state dentist, it made us appreciate Don all the more. Not only is he caring, gentle, and funny (love the cornball jokes), but he is cutting edge in his field. He keeps abreast of all the latest technology and skills. Combine this with a cozy environment and fabulous staff -- Irene and Christy love him so much they've worked in the same place for decades! -- and you create the perfect dental experience. A big shout-out to Kim also, who is a thorough hygienist with a soft touch.
Give Dr. Atkins a visit, and much like all the people my family has referred, you will undoubtedly fall in love.</review>

<Text>As much as you can enjoy the dentist, I had a great experience with Don. I have a fear of tooth pain, as I have had bad experiences in the past, but Don was very gentle, stopping frequently to ask if I was ok and giving me plenty of numbing medicine. He gave me options for my teeth and further care. I felt that I had all of the information I needed to make a decision on what was best for me and what I could afford. They worked well with my schedule and I always saw a smiling face when I came in the door. I will keep coming to Don and will recommend others in the future!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>I have always been so pleased with you and your staff.  I have been coming to this same office since I was about 5 yrs old. I am now 70. Dr. Weil was there, who retired many years ago and Dr. Atkins took over.  The staff is great and very friendly, but I still don't like to go in there and have them grind on my teeth or fill cavities  I am numb, but it just sounds awful.  Oh Well, it has to be done.

The entire staff is always a pleasure. Today I did not have an appointment; I only had a problem needing immediate attention, and Dr. Atkins and staff worked me in despite thier own personal problems. This is a great office that I often recommend to anyone seeking top professionalism and deep care.< /text>

<Review>My husband and I are fairly new patients to Dr. Atkins and we have been 100% pleased on every single visit.

Prior to Dr. Atkins, I was experiencing pain in a tooth and had a feeling something was not right.  So, I went on a hunt to find a dentist that had integrity and really cared about their patient's teeth.  My husband and I both have had multiple bad experiences with other dentists and were frequently feeling that we were receiving rushed and apathetic treatment, so the time had come to find the right Dr.

The reviews I found on the internet on Dr. Atkins were consistantly high and all spoke well of him and his work, so I booked an appointment.  They were able to get me scheduled in a timely manner. The office staff is very friendly.  Based on the extremely thorough consultation that Dr. Atkins gave me (x-rays, high quality pictures of each individual tooth, thorough examination, discussion and review etc.) I immediately knew that my teeth were in great hands.  Dr. Atkins advised me on what to do with my problem tooth (ended up being a former root canal issue) and it has since been resolved and healed.

There were several issues with other teeth that I was completely unaware of, that had they gone unchecked could have caused terrible pain, harsh procedures and heavy costs (I have pictures to prove it).  Dr. Atkins doesn't wait till a full blown tooth problem arises, he catches things before they become a problem, as best he can.  I trust his judgement with my teeth.  He has since resolved all of the problem areas in my mouth and things have been great.

He never seems rushed and at times will even come out to the waiting room to greet you himself.  I also like that he shares things (fun facts, vacation spots etc.) about his family and his staff in the lobby, it makes it feel like they are transparent and pursuing relationship along with their business, and not just business.

Dr. Atkins is outside of our insurance network so the out of pocket costs are a bit higher then other dentists I have been to.  However, it is worth the extra money!  I have realized that trying to find an in network good quality dentist has just not been something I have found and I always end up regretting trying to 'save' money.

Also, once I sent my husband there, Dr. Atkins thanked me multiple times for referring my husband to him and later sent a $75 gift card to his office which was awesome and very unexpected! :)

I could seriously go on about more specifics that I appreciate about Dr. Atkins and his staff but I will cut it here.<//Review>< pictures>

I am very thankful for this hotel in the midst of a pandemic actually a year after the pandemic this hotel has everything to offer at 10 o’clock at night I was able to print my paperwork up for tomorrow and not have to go to Staples. They also had a laundry room it works they have a cart to bring you things in and great customer service at the front door of the room is clean I’m grateful even for a bag of breakfast in the morning. As it is In this town this hotel is full service nothing is closed they are fully opened for Business! Thank you 🙏 and 5 ⭐️ s isn’t enough!<//review>

< Review>
The hotel itself was fairly decent. The location wasn't bad, it's right by the on/off ramp which I liked. The parking lot for the hotel was extremely small however, I ended up having to park right next door at panda express for a night here and there during my stay due to lack of available parking spaces in the hotel's lot. The staff wasn't the friendliest (other than Natasha - she's FANTASTIC). The manager is actually extrememly rude and inconsiderate. There is a $100 cash deposit ($50 for credit card) that they are super strict about. What makes this hotel worth it though, and is better than the price, is the King Suit with Balcony room. I believe there is only 2 in the hotel (on top of one another) that have a balcony and being as it's a suit, it's very very spacious and comfortably furnished. I would deal with the poor customer service reps and lack of parking at this hotel to stay there as long as I would be in the one of the two balcony suits. Otherwise, I'd book somewhere else and find a better price with a nicer staff.< /Review>

<review>For a 4 star place they did 5 star work.  Everyone who worked there was friendly and caring.  When we arrived we got help from an office young man to carry everything to 2nd floor for us. A different one helped when we left.  The beds were comfy, the pillows better than the ones on my bed.right next door was Chinese food, across the street IHOP, Nations Burgers, a high end "Nugget" grocery store that besides a top bakery & deli, also has a salad & soup bar.  Best fresh stuff in town the great goody finds and stuff that will just blow your mind when you realize you have to take something home with you.  Great wines too.
The Heritage had plenty of good parking. An A. C. unit that brought the room down 28° in less than 15 minutes.  The rooms are built well, it was nice and quiet.  As I said the whole package-location, easy food access, pool, cable & internet is a bargain but it's the people that make you want to go back.  It's nice to be spoiled. High Recommendation 😊

HIGH RECOMMENDATION 😊< /review>< userid>

Natasha is her name I believe. other than that the hotel maids, actually every employee working there was not wearing a uniform let alone name tags. my point tho is that one cleaning maid had walked into our room unannounced nor did he knock. be just came right in. so that was a little unprofessional on his part. and then on top of that the lobby staff was extremely rude and unprofessional. they kept my deposit both times. as one reservation I paid with my card and the other with cash. a card deposit is $50 and a cash deposit costs $100. never had that happen at a hotel either but they ended up keeping both and ive still yet to be told why. and the charges are still pending for the card transaction. the hotel room was big and decent. my girlfriend liked the balcony they had in the room and again it was very very spacious.<//Text><username>Kody Stoy< /username>< pictures>

< Review>
I’m currently here now and it’s 2 am. I’m only awake because I can hear the people next door fighting and yelling. The room is okay enough. The door isn’t sealed all the way so as mentioned before, the highway is very audible as well. There was hair in the tub so not sure about the cleaning standards. I would say it’s truly overpriced for what it is. The only reason I’m giving it two stars, is because the front desk service was nice and they are one of the only hotels in this area that allow dogs. If pets aren’t an issue, I would absolutely spend my money elsewhere as listening to the conversation next door and every car drive by on the highway is not ideal for me.< /Review>

<Review>Rooms are comfortable. Area is quiet, excluding the freeway behind the hotel. Our problem has been with reservations. twice I've prepaid and had the hotel attempt to charge my card for the full amount instead of the deposit. Paid for a suite, and got on site and was told the hotel was overbooked, and I couldn't get the room I paid for. To boot, I should've paid 90 dollars for the room based on the website I booked the room at, instead I was charged 93 dollars. We have decided we are going to try a different hotel, as this one doesn't seem to appreciate long term customers.< /Review>< pictures>

It was in a great location for freeway use, too cold to use the pool, the rooms looked like they were slapped together with over spray paint on the carpet where they spray painted the flooring. There were no towels and no coffee pot. the room smelled like a smoking room, we wanted a non smoking room. Ugh!<//review>

There was a 1 inch gap under our door to the outside. The door handle was filthy and the bathroom had an ant infestation. The parking lot is tiny and horrible to try to park in. Over all it was not a hotel we would ever stay at again. The staff was very friendly and nice but that’s the only good thing about the hotel. We had planned to stay five night but left after only one night because I could not take how run down and dirty it was.<//Text>

A few days later I see they charged the $50 deposit to my account. I called them and they apologized and refunded me. It’s been 30 days now and I still have not received my refund. Every time I called to check up on it all they tell me is that it’s still processing or some other BS line. Really unsatisfied. The room was old and outdated. The facility was old and outdated.

So our check in time was scheduled for 2pm. We show up about 2:15 and they said there was a mistake and real check in was at 3. A little annoying but fine. We wait in the parking lot until 3. While we were sitting we watched the employees moving very little, just kind of walking around. I saw one of the employees coming out of the room while vaping. At 3 we go into the office to check in and the woman says there are still no rooms available. It was 3 o clock and they didn’t have any rooms ready for check in. The lady started calling and found one room that was finished. We’re in the room and start to notice there are ants in the bathroom, on the night stand, and in the bed. We call the office and we’re able to switch rooms but overall this has been an incredibly disappointing experience.<//review>

Front door has large gap and you can hear everything outside. Walls are thin and bathroom/tub creak so much you feel you are going to fall through. Fan in bath is coming out of wall and you can hear everything outside. Bed was very uncomfortable for me and air conditioner didnt work well.

Bed is fine, but room feels so dirty and gross. Stains on the carpet. Towels are also stained. Mold on the bathroom ceiling. Would not recommend. I have to stay in town a few more days but moving hotels. Would not recommend. It shouldn’t be a Best Western</Text>

I came at 1 AM there was nobody at the desk to help me I waited for 30 minutes I tried calling and nobody answered, I came back at 2:30 AM and they were still nobody at the desk to help me, I’ve stayed here before so I know that your desk is 24 hours so I’m just confused as to why there was nobody at the desk. Both times I came I waited for at least 30 minutes. This is completely unprofessional.</review>

We've stayed multiple times. The last couple of check-ins haven't been that pleasant. One the desk lady claimed I purchased a a smoking room when I didnt. They moved me to a room with no shower curtain. Next visit paid for the suite rm up front, but when I cheked in was told it wasn't available. Refunded less than the difference between the suite and a regular king rm. We have decided not to return to this property due to the overbooking problem. Different if I hadn't paid up front.</Text>

The front desk staff, Rio, super friendly and nice. But the rooms, horrible. The first room he put us in was used. There was trash on the night stand and the beds were slept in. So, I called down to the front desk, Rio brought up another set of room keys. I had booked a double bed for myself and kids, but the only room type left was a king. Rio said he would adjust the price for the inconvenience.

The other room that we were put in had Bed Bugs!! And they knew it had bed bugs because they put the mattress in a bag!!

After that I canceled my reservation and requested a full refund. That was just absolutely unacceptable. Thank God I checked before I laid down!!</review>

Well to start off with the MOTEL air conditioner did not work at all on the hottest day was 105 outside enough air conditioner did not work the television did not work we asked the girl at the front desk many times to come fix the television we finally had to fix it ourselves they never did accommodate us because it was so hot we didn’t get any sleep last night. And to top it all off when we went out to leave the next morning somebody had ripped the doorhandle out of my truckVery bad MOTEL I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.< /Review>

Front desk does not work.
I arrived for my check in and the front desk asked my surname twice.
She told me I had no reservation.
I was with the Best Western reservation in my hand, I showed her, and she confirmed I had not.
Well I explained to her my credit card was already used by the hotel to secure the reservation.
After 15 minutes she found my reservation.
I asked for the high floor in my reservation, she put me on the first floor.
Clean hotel with very clean rooms.
Housekeeping staff very good.
Basic breakfast nothing special per daily charge</Text>

<pics>None</pics><text>The GOOD: The hotel is easy to find, in a good location, and parking was not too terribly bad… I could park very close to the room. There are many restaurants around within walking distance.  Check in was a breeze. The room was clean, smelled fine, and looked like it had been somewhat recently remodeled. The bathroom was excellent, clean and fully functional. The shower had a tall showerhead, (I am 6 foot one), and had plenty of water pressure and plenty of hot water. There were two toilet paper dispensers one with the paper rolling over the top, and one with the paper rolling underneath… a sure way to satisfy everyone on that issue! The main reason I stayed at this hotel was that their continental breakfast was super-continental… they had scrambled eggs every day along with either seasoned potatoes  some days, bacon some days, sausage some days. Also a waffle maker with a variety of fresh toppings.  The breakfast area was kept constantly clean and tidy. I stayed there a week and the breakfast area was never crowded.

The BAD: The back rooms butt right next to Interstate 80, so you will get interstate traffic noise all night long, high-speed cars, 18 wheeler trucks, so bring a white noisemaker to sleep by, or if you are lucky, ask for one of the rooms that don’t butt up to I-80.  If you stay on the first floor, you’ll hear the people above you walking around (wood floors).  The breakfast area was small, but because it was never crowded it functioned well. Check your bill and compare it to the price that was quoted so that you don’t ‘accidentally” get charged more than you were quoted. And room tax and ‘assessment fees’ will add up quick.

Overall satisfaction was great and I would stay there again.</text><Rate>5< /Rate><time>1583442922101<//time>< resp>

There’s no smoking signs on the doors, but the room smelled awful when we checked in and there were ants crawling on the toilet. It’s a pet friendly room and WiFi works though.<//Review>

<text>No heater (weird remote was broken and no thermostat, just a wall unit that did not turn on) - was hoping the bed would make up for it but even the comforter was thin and disappointing. Room was so cold that when I took a shower, it set the smoke detector off. Floors not clean (wrappers, hair and shards of glass on carpet/bathroom floor). Also, very thin walls and you could hear every car driving by on freeway. Upsides: gentleman working front desk, huge room with large back patio. Would not come back again<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< username>

The good:
Staff was friendly and helpful the showers had good pressure. Hotel has the typical Best Western spread in the mornings with breakfast beginning at 6 am which was a big plus for me. During my stay the wifi had a pretty fast speed as well. Mattress was fairly comfortable to me. Plenty of good restaurants nearby too, which was great.
The Bad:
Room was not very clean on check in. a good amount of hair on the blankets and bedding and a towel. New sheets were requested and dispensed very quickly. The bathroom floor had also not been vacuumed and there was a toothpaste blob on the leading edge of the sink counter.
Smoking rooms are also in close proximity to non-smoking.

Would I come back here?  Possibly. The rate was decent, and there were many good restaurants and stores nearby.</Review>

Friendly professional staff.  Adequate free hot breakfast with good strong coffee.  Quick professional check in and out.

The breakfast was also above the standard. We had waffles, bacon, and eggs. They also had juice, coffee, cereal, yogurt, and  toasts. My only reason for 4 star, when we checked in the front desk agent was smoking outside then had an "oh crap" look as we were waiting at the desk. My only other issue was our room still smelled like paint which gave me a little headache.
Other than that the stay was great with no issues. Thanks Best Western!!<//review>< userid>

The rooms and pool and grounds have gotten a face lift! A very nice change! The Manager (Kim) has done an amazing job of picking the staff that is unbelievably on top of their work. They have been very helpful, understanding and kind. The front desk has been very professional and timely with all matters (Especially Lydia) The Housekeeping is very polite and does a wonderful job. The continental breakfast is delightful and perfect for all ages. I would recommend this place first over many others!<//Text>< Pics>

Disappointed with this hotel.  We paid $130 a night for a room with a leak under the sink which created water on the floor (which I cleaned up when we checked in).
Electrical issue in room which caused lights to flicker and A/C unit to surge.  Leaky, dripping bathtub.  The entry door did not seal shut.
Not at all impressed by this Best Western and we are frequent hotel guests.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

< review>
I must start off this review by saying although the manager the next morning was greatly appreciated,it doesn't change the fact that the room should have never been that way.the owner of this hotel should be reprimanded.you should impose a hefty fine upon him until he fixes his hotel,use some of his profit  and update this hideous Hotel.Make sure your cleaning staff actually cleans the room.but it seems hard to hold them to a higher standard when you don't have any.
The room had a used condom in the shower as well as a plastic bag over the fire extinguisher.The plastic bag obviously for someone smoking in a non-smoking room. like i  said from the start the manager was greatly appreciated the next day.but the bad experiences a hand in that room will last a lifetime,and you can't put a price on that.p.s I have pictures if anybody from corporate would like me to email them to you.<//review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite for 1 night. Even though it was 109 degrees outside, the small A/C unit kept us cool and comfortable. It was nice to have so much space! Breakfast was very accommodating.They kept soy milk available and non-dairy creamers, so we had more flexibility at breakfast.

Handy location; next door to a Panda Express and just minutes away from the Jelly Belly factory and several olive oil tasting places.

Really nice, friendly staff! Highly recommended!<//review>< pictures>

<name>Margie Alvarez<//name><review>We had to evac from the sonoma fires twice. We were told we`d have to wait until 3 for our rooms to be ready. We showed up at 3 only to be told  it would be another 5 minutes.  That's fine except it was another 3 hrs! We could have excused it for having so many evacuees but the next day the maids didn't get to our room until 5. Our tv remote didn't work well so it was changed out. The new one didn't work much better.  The next evening we came back from dinner only to find ourselves and 2 others were locked out. The front desk had locked the whole top floor out. On the up side the cleaning crew was nice and the breakfast had alot to choose from. And the food was good. Needless to say we won't being staying at  the Fairfield location again and will think twice before stay at any Best Western.<//review>< user_id>

Though the rooms have been updated with new furnishings and carpet there were ants crawling around on our sheets and in the bathroom sinks. Lots of ants. Also, there were two long hairs on our sheets when we pulled down or covers. This leads me to wonder if the sheets have been changed since their last use.  The room also smelled of urine. I assume from dogs. We stay in a lot of hotels and this is my worst experience in a long time.  We came to our room late so I haven't contacted management yet.  I am not sure how they will react.  In all fairness they may have quickly taken care of it. They seem to respond to reviews. Which tells me they are interested in making the place better.

Check that!!! After reading a few reviews they were told about the ant problem at least a week ago. That makes it unacceptable. No one should have to worry all night about ants crawling on them. I'm writing this at 2 am. Morning can not come soon enough!< /text>

The first room was in the process of being cleaned when they handed us the key...so they gave us another room.  The hot water in the shower was running constantly not bad, but waste of water.  There was NO hairdryer in room took 2 days to get one then was not attached to wall, very inconvenient to use.  One of the maids when I asked about a hair dryer said she had reported it 2 days prior......it did not make for a bad stay, but was not the most pleasant.  The hard part is they kept asking for a "10" rating when talking with the staff.  Sorry not when there are issues.</review>

Not good, floors were filthy and the pool was "out of service for Renovations" but had been that way for quite a while according to the employee.  I will never stay there again.  I would have rather slept in my car and saved $225.00!  I am a Best Western fan but this one is just a dive/dump with incompetent help and poor management (as per their own employee!)<//review>

<review>The room just felt dirty. In the shower, there was hair on the walls from the people that were previously there. Several of our towels had (what seemed to be) faint makeup stains. When we were getting into bed there was random hairs in between our sheets too. There was random stains on our desk chair & it felt like the tables and lamps hadn't been wiped down in months. It made the entire atmosphere of the room just disgusting! I don't think they fully go through and clean everything entirely in between vacancies & they really should! The attention to detail is most definitely missing. I think they may be remodeling and making improvements but our room was not one of them. The only few good thing were the very comfortable bed (we travel with blankets so we used our own) the a/c unit and the free breakfast; they have quite a variety and it's very decent. Other than that I would NOT recommend it :/<//review><userid>116010139653996712093< /userid>< Response>

Was a lot nicer inside that I had expected. Issue with backed up sink in first room, then had to move due to maintenance not showing up. Second room, water spouting like a fountain from the toilet tank. Next move to a third room was better. Plus I'm not going to complain about a free night. Nice staff. Clean rooms.</Review>

<text>We were looking for a moderately priced hotel to stay in for an upcoming wedding. There was a discount available for booking online with Best Western so I chose the room with a King size bed. The building was a little older but the room was clean and the staff was super friendly. For being fairly close to the Vacaville outlets and very close to the venue, it was the most reasonable. Would certainly re-book if needed.<//text>< date>

<review>The room was okay. We got there after check-in, about 2:15, and the front desk attendant said we had to wait for our room still. That was a little off putting as we came after the check-in time. When we got into the room, at first we thought the smell was cleaning product, then we realized it was spray to cover the smoke smell. We asked for and booked a non-smoking room and we could tell they simply tried to cover it up. Im not sure if I would stay here again. The breakfast was okay. We came about halfway through and the eggs and sausage had only a little bit left. We waited as we thought they would fill them up, but they never did. There was no coffee for breakfast and the coffee maker in the room was incredibly confusing with no directions that we gave up.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80853d35956b186b:0xe06591e6139fd51d<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The room was 75 degrees when I got there and heavily perfumed which was a problem, and I couldnt figure out where the smell was coming from so I dealt with it the entire time.Utimately, if youre looking for a quick overnight this is fine place. If youre looking to stay a few days, you may want to stay someplace a little more comfortable.The service was great and the continental breakfast was really tasty.<//Review></record>

Room was clean and mostly comfortable and staff was great! We had two problems with the room: coffee pods did not fit in the machine (minor) the hot water in the shower went from "extremely hot" to "scalding" (not safe)! We checked in very late, so told the front desk in the morning. They were extremely understanding and apologized, but since we were only staying one night we didn't get the chance to see how the would accommodate us. For what I needed, a place to stay for a 1 day trip, it was fine and I would stay again, but perhaps inspect your room.<//text>

We have been staying at this property for the last 8–10 years, usually on the same weekend – – the last weekend in September.  We choose this hotel because they  didn't use flowery, perfumed room deodorizers. That is, until this last visit this past weekend. Unfortunately, three out of the four in our group are severely allergic to most of those types of deodorizers and as a result, we are now sick with serious allergies, inflamed sinuses, postnasal drip, etc. DO NOT stay here if you have severe allergies to these kinds of products.

In addition, the prices weren't astronomical although this time we thought the price was a little high and more than we have paid in the past.  Otherwise, the staff is helpful and friendly  and it's a pretty nice place to stay.<//text>

The worst Best Western that I have stayed at. The room was really dirty the heating and air conditioning didn't work just made a lot of noise and it was extremely noisy. The only good part was the girl working the front desk was very nice< /Text>

We're sorry that we do not have guest laundry on site due to the size of the property being very small and the location of the hotel is directly off of the freeway so unfortunately the noise from that is out of our control. The pool has been under construction for a while for upgrades and we are currently waiting on the city to approve the changes before we are allowed to open it for guest use, which is posted on the website in hopes to alleviate confusion. Our rates change daily and weekend rates can be high due to expected occupancy.

The location of this property leaves much to be desired. It's on a major thoroughfare in a district of the city which could be dubbed a strip mall. That being said, the staff was friendly, the room was comfortable, and the breakfast was filling. My only complaints would be the seating for the breakfast. They are all high top tables with two seats at each. Not very accommodating for a family. Also when I was showering, I noticed an old moldy towel on top of the shower enclosure. I'm 6-3, so I was able to see it easily. Maybe they need to hire taller Maids. Haha. All in all, I would stay there again. I just wish the pool was open. Too cold in February.<//Text>

<Review>I would not recommend this hotel due to the noise from the busy street, a lot of construction workers staying overnight, hanging out in the parking lot drinking, laughing and talking loud. I did not feel comfortable leaving my room to go get dinner. Thank god I had some snacks. The room had a stale smell of smoke, and the thin walls hearing people having sex was unsettling. If it had not been for the polite and friendly staff I would only give this hotel 1 star if that. Glad I only needed a room for 1 night to go visit my 93 year old father in the morning. I drove from Oregon on my way to Bay Area, and will definitely stay somewhere else next visit. Not worth the $82.00 when you can get a cheaper room elsewhere with the same issues. I thought for the price it would have been better than a cheaper place. Guess I was wrong. Very disappointing!< /Review><date>1483558267687< /date>< resp>

<Text>Travel a lot and stay at Best Western locations so I didn’t check reviews thinking I was staying at the quality I’m use to. Big mistake this is a low budget hotel. My room smelt like a cigarette butt and so did my pillows and blankets 1990 feel here the picture they have is a joke nothing of what the room looked like. It was super late and I was exhausted from driving that’s the only reason I stood in the room and woke up super early to get out of this Place with a headache from smell. 😩🤢 Frequent travelers beware!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Reasonable rates, decent rooms, great location for food and shopping. I have stayed there for a total of four nights in the last six months. They seem to be in the middle of a renovation process and each room varies  slightly. Hopefully they get the rooms completed. Parking is tight, and rooms next to HWY 80 can be a little noisy.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1531067491181, 'text': 'Hello Wade,\nWe are excited to hear that you enjoyed your stay.

Great place to stay even if you're visiting San Francisco.
Super comfy beds, everything was clean, large rooms.
Breakfast was great! and its only a 50 min drive into the heart of SF.
We paid 80-90$ a night, definitely worth the money.<//Text>

There is an IHOP across the street but the breakfast at the motel was so wonderful we never felt the need to go there instead. All the employees were helpful.

My room was not ready at the advertised check-in time. The rollaway bed for my additional guest in the room looks like it was purchased in 1960 and the cover is disintegrating. Housekeeping staff smokes outside the rooms causing the rooms to smell of smoke even though posted as non-smoking area. I cleaned a layer of dust from the dresser prior to using it. The manager was not on-site or available to discuss issues with. My faucet was at a steady drip rate the whole time and the temperature of the water for a shower is either scalding hot water or cold water, and is subject to change hot or cold when someone in a nearby room turns their water on. The air conditioner air smells bad, probably partially due to stale cigarette smoke drawn from outside.< /Review>< Date>

Although the front desk staff was friendly, I cannot recommend this property.  It was dirty and outdated.  There was grime on the TV remote, doorknobs and furniture.  The carpet needed vacuuming  and the room smelled vaguely of dog.  I only booked here because we stayed in a BW in Durango and it was great.  I will not book this motel again.</Review>

<review>Not anywhere close to normal Best Western Standards: AC nonadjustable, hot/cold water swapped, ancient hard to adjust shower, freeway noise  should be less,   only large thick pillows -> watch out for a stiff neck.  Don't be fooled by exterior cosmetic upgrades (recent repaved parking and new roof).   Access from WB I80 is through the adjacent Chinese restaurant drive through (Which was blocked by a queue when we got there and we had to wander all over town to find a way to make a u turn to get back.)< /review>< pictures>

Great stay.  From setting up my reservation to check in thru check out always a great stay.  Better then staying with family and no worries about having to do the dishes.  I love this place.< /text>

<Text>I've stayed here before and it was nice the first time, but this last time the room smelled like cigarette smoke and it was a no smoking room. The smell was so strong that it forced me to cough. The "only thing that they could do about i"t was to have someone come in and spray a bunch of air freshener and disinfectant which then made me cough as well. Although the staff was nice there could have been more done.</Text>< userid>

Pro---they let us check in early
Con's---Didn't clean our room one day. My husband went to get us towels at the office and the manager didn't have a key to get into the housekeeping room.  Never did get any towels that night and manager didn't even have the courtesy to call and tell us.
Sat. night the police had to come for a disturbance right outside our room.
Will not stay here again!< /Review>

The price per night was to high for the quality hotel. We paid over 600.00 for 5 days and had to deal with an Ant infested bathroom during our entire stay.  The first night we discovered that the bed linen had not been changed. Due to no house keeping available and only one staff working the front desk, we had to change our own bed linen in the middle of the night. The breakfast was very low quality. We instead had to dine offsite due to the lack of options spending even more money for our family of 4. Very disappointed.< /Review>

<rating>None</rating><Review>This is one of those throw back motels from the 60s in which a minimal and poorly done remodel has been attempted . Decaying drywall, multiple ceiling patches, atrocious carpet, the ancient smell of cigarettes under new paint, thin sheets, someone elses hair in the tub; you name it! Added to it being incredibly noisy (35 from I-80 with single pane windows). At the same price we could have stayed at the Holiday Inn or any other place but my 10 yr old was exhausted and I had booked with no refund available while on the road. DONT STAY HERE!<//Review>< Pics>

Pool broken entire week and no prior notification. Ants in bathroom that kept coming back and front desk comment was "I don't know how ants could get there". That was it. Phone wasn't working in room. Had to walk up 2 flights of stairs which those with mobility issues is difficult and zero assistance for that. Lights in bathroom and dressing area come on auto.atically so when someone enters area during the night the entire roo. Is lit up like mid day. Had to personally turn off 3 separate lightswitches to get dark again. Room dingy. Housekeeping didn't even make bed one day. Bed so hard I had to go buy a mattress topper. Bad experience all around d. If hadn't paid in advance e would have left first day.< /text>

<review>Staff was friendly, hotel was clean. Could use some updating but If you're not picky then it's a good place to stay for the price. Breakfast was served for a long time which is great if you sleep in. Only downfall was it is noisy due to the traffic next to it.< /review>< name>

<review>This is not family friendly hotel. Rooms are very dirty, dry up urine all over the toilet seat, cloged draines. Inside the room smells like body oder, outside room smells like weeds. Bunch of men’s seating outside their hottels doors drinking and smoking weeds. In the morning loud knock on the door woke up my kids, outside was first responders asking if we called 911.
This is the worst hotel my family ever stayed in. Now my children asking me if the next hotel we will stay in will be this bad, this hotel scared the life out of them.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Working the TV was a little confusing and the key card wouldnt work sometimes so I had to go to the office a few times to get a new one. The electricity went out for about 4 hours, butthat wasnt the hotels fault. It was 103 degrees and everyone had their AC on full blast. Otherwise the hotel is fine and the staff is friendly and helpful.< /review>

I reserved this hotel weeks in advance. When I arrived after driving 12 hours, I was told the specific room I had requested (3 queens) had been given to someone else. "Would I like to cancel?" Having just driven all day I asked for the next best thing & was assigned room 245 with 2 queens and what looked like a twin bed. Considering I had a party of 5, that could work. I took my luggage up to the room - past the many smoking guests in the stairwells and parking lot (so much for a non-smoking hotel). After about 5 minutes of walking around the room with shoes off, our feet were black as coal! Have they ever cleaned the carpet?!? It got worse, the microwave and mini fridge were from what appeared to be the early 1980's. The chair at the desk was broken and could not be adjusted - a big issue for my husband since he brought work with him and needed a desk. I went to use the bathroom and there were at dozens of ants everywhere! I'm talking in the shower, the crawling on all the towels , up the walls, all over the vanities...it was disgusting! I then hoped on my cc account to check my available credit - they pre-authorized the full amount of my 3 night stay + their incidental amount of about $100 which is pretty standard. Only problem is they pre-authorized my card TWICE (tying up an additional $500+ in credit, which I certainly don't appreciate while traveling. At that point I headed to the office to let them know I certainly did not intend to stay in their hotel. They then told me they could fumigate the room the following morning if I'd like to move my reservation by a day. Kayla (the front desk attendant) was very nice and tried to help me the best she could for it being about 11 o'clock at night by that point. She canceled my reservation without penalty. I went back to the room as I was figuring out where I could go - with my 3 kids, a car alarm goes off in the parking lot - not sure why but it woke them as they had started to drift off to sleep while I was trying to sort things out. Thankfully it wasn't my car & I was able to find another hotel closer into my destination. This was the grossest motel room I have ever booked & I've stayed in some cheap local places...the only good thing about this place was Kayla's attempts to help me in the midst of a really bad situation.<//text>

<Text>I stayed here over a weekend in early October 2013 and was delighted by the value and friendliness.

OK, yes, ever-busy Interstate 80 is close -- but I find the real-life freeway traffic background sounds relaxing. And OK, yes, this is an older building -- but I found that charmed me. I realize these could be deal-breakers for some. East Monte Vista Avenue is home to diverse fast-food and chain restaurants and stores galore (even a Goodwill).

My room was clean and comfortable and the plumbing, air conditioner, fridge, microwave, tv and charging station all worked as expected. I was only hoping for no-frills functionality and this place provided a notch up from that.

The free breakfast seemed plenty generous to me, though the lobby area it was served in (buffet style) was on the small side (the manager mentioned expanding it into one of the office rooms soon, though). The staff encouraged me to return whenever for juice and coffee refills between 7 am and 10 pm.

This visit blended business and chilling out and I felt renewed afterwards.

So, I've put this place on my OK-By-Me list.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Horrible hotel.  I do not know how it ever got an excellent rating.  Poor parking, lots of freeway noise, room dirty, tub faucet dripped constantly, tub fixtures felt as if they were ready to come out of the wall, air conditioner very noisy.  We will never stay there again.  This motel gives Best Western a bad name.<//Review>

The room itself was nothing spectacular but suited our need. It was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was just ok for me, My kids and I opted to go across the street to IHOP the second morning we were there.Overall I would recomend this hotel. if you are trying to save some money on your trip and dont plan on spending a lot of time in the hotel room then this hotel is a great choice.</text><UserId.>None</UserId.>< Name>

My account shows 2 holds for $209.42 instead of just 1.  That was Friday night. Now, the following Tuesday, my account still has two holds instead of just 1 charge for $190.38, and when I called I was told that the manager is gone for a week and for me to call my bank.
I'm very disappointed with my stay! The carpet turned my kids feet black & trying to find a resolution for my bank account being messed has been very unacceptable!< /review>

We recently headed to Yellowstone and mount Rushmore and ended up staying at 3 best westerns. Great hotels except for 1 where the AC was poorly placed and room wasn't getting cold enough but not a deal breaker.</Text>

Friendly effieciant staff, good breakfast, comfy rooms, the only issue is the location, if you are a light sleeper and need a good nights rest you will have to use ear plugs, a freeway and major roads on all sides create traffic noise all night long</Review>

Will not stay here again. Room was dirty - previous pet urine in multiple places on the carpet. Room did not have a shower curtain and was not cleaned (hairs/dirt in tub, dirt on floors, ant infestation).< /text>

I picked so many options to take home lol and loved everything I ate. So much flavor in the foods, even the sweets that I bought. Aside from the food being delicious, the customer service was amazing as well. I couldn't have asked for a better experience here. Thank you😊 Next time I'll remember all the names of what I chose lol Oh! and the prices are great.< /review>< Pictures>

Their food is always good. They do run out of food quickly...so get there early. Customer service is very slow paced, but very welcoming and attentive. Definitely not a place to pick up food if you're in a rush!< /text>

I didnt love the noodles and a tad bit greasy but it was nice to feel at home. The people that work here are wonderful and kind. The vibe is right. The pineapple empanadas were amazing</Text>

Today is my wife's birthday... so instead of the Buffet or any other American, Asian or Mexican restaurant that we would normally go to... Besides my grilln... since its raining today she wanted some Polynesian food. So, we googled and this spot popped up.

Nice little Polynesian/ Mexican spot. We ordered 2 Maui plates and 2 pineapple pie. Loved the food everthing on the plate was ono... But, our food was just warm... not steaming hot. There was actually no hot steam coming out from our plates. It was our first time here... But, it won't be our last. Luv our poly peepz and food.<//text>

I would like to put five stars however the wait time makes it three or four stars due to the long long wait.
Every time I go to the Hayward Social Security office I’m there waiting at least 2 or 3 hours before the doors even open, then the wait is still two hours  long.
I do hope they figure out a way to get people in and out faster. No matter what the service has always been wonderful at Hayward Social Security office
Pleasant employees, pleasant people thank goodness for that....<//Text>

Window 15 customer service agent has the worst customer service and manners. His name is mr Yu! The agent have a complete disrespect for older people disregarding all the paperwork and documents that’s been submitted every year for five years .worst customer service I’ve ever seen in my life ,treated my grandparentsLikely nothing , it was absolutely disgusting customer serviceAnd the issue was resolved on the after talking to a manager which was very kind and responsive thanks to that Person The issue was solved in the end!

Do no recommend this social security office to anyone.<//Text>

They handle a lot of cases/people. Very thorough and professional. They treat people with  respect and courtesy.  Other than that being said. It is a government controlled civilian agency. I think like any other business, I am sure they have there share of problems. I can't say I'm overly fond of the them. I rate them at average.<//Text>

It has been a waiting game like always. That's just the process and then you get checked in wait some more. Staff is courteous when you get to them. It's not their fault. I am glad for their patience and understanding<//review>

<Time>1466016138323<//Time><Review>Fast for me.  Visited this office on Wed. June 15 to complete my Medicare enrollment.

I had earlier called the SS toll free number to secure an appointment.  After a 30 minute hold I was told that the first actual appointment available was more than 60 days out.  The SS rep. suggested that I simply go to my nearest office without an appointment.

I decided to go the next day and arrived at aprox. 9:15am.  There is ample parking on behind the office building that houses this SS location.

The office consists of a large seating area with several "teller window" type stations along one wall.  The office is clean but very basic.

To my surprise the office was not very busy.  After checking in with the young security guard I took a number from the self-service kiosk and settled in for what I thought would be a long wait.

My number was called in less that 15 minutes and my Q&A with the Social Security rep. was equally brief.  By my watch my entire time actually in this office was no more  than 30 minutes.

I was dreading this visit and assumed that I would be subjected to a DMV like experience but this was not the case.  All this being said I did arrive with all my documentation in hand.  I have no idea how long my actual interaction would have been had I not been prepared.  As with all thing government, YMMV.</Review>< Resp>

Ridiculously long wait time. Like bring a snack and make sure you use the restroom before. If you get up to go pee...be prepared to lose your seat and end up standing for the next two hours...or take some else's seat whey can't hold it any longer.<//Review>

<Review>Window 11 customer service agent has the worst customer service and manners.  The agent stated it would take 6-8weeks to process a name change for my daughter’s name change  because her birth certificate is from Texas.  This is after we returned to get her photo id, her social security card and birth certificate does not validate identity.

I tried to call twice. First, a 57 min wait and was switched to the survey that comes at the end of the call. Called back and after a 41 min wait, I was provoked and ended up being disrespectful to the rep. So sorry about the whole thing. Especially that I let her bait me.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Airport Little League is an Urban Initiative  League that has been working hard to become one of The Best League around the South Sacramento Area. Its President Henry Hernandez, VP Gus Jauregui, The Heart of The League(because she wears a lot of hats) Mrs. Joanne Jauregui, and the rest of the Board Members, Along with the Managers, Coaches, and Parents, All make this league feel like one Big Family. I highly recommend signing your child up here and joining in on all the Baseball Little League Fun and Memories that you will cherish for a lifetime. I played for this Little League back in 1984-1989, and I now have 2 of my own sons that have been with the League for past 3, working on 4 seasons.</Text>< Name>

<Review>Nice park with two little league fields and a snack area.  Fun to see the planes land on the nearby runway as the game is underway.  Parking seems easier here than other fields.  Only drawback is that there isn't much shade for players or spectators, so wear your sunscreen!<//Review>< Pics>

The generous portion of meat and vermicelli worth’s another star.  The flawless taste of the broth worth’s two more stars.  This place is just like Vietnam Saigon.  The staff is ultra friendly just like Vietnam too.  I’ll be coming back quite a lot.< /Review>< rating>

Best pho so far, with a great reasonable price. Place can definitely use an upgrade, only accepts cash.<//Text>

<text>Located in a small plaza, this mom and pop pho joint is a favorite go to spot for cheap pho (50% off all beef pho). There is limited parking in front of the plaza, but you can park in the plaza next door (where the Stater Bros is) and walk over.

We came in at about 8:30 to 9 pm and there was still a constant trickle of people coming in. The tables were relatively clean, as well as the bathrooms. Note, the men's bathroom lock doesn't work!! So knock or you may be in for an embarrassing situation.

The servers are nice and fast, the food came out quickly and the waiter was constantly refilling our waters and checking on us.

I got the pho tai large, and they did not skimp even though the price for the large was only $6.95. There was so much noodles and meat.

Last important note, CASH ONLY.

All in all, good pho joint for starving students. Would definitely return when my pho craving kicks in again.<//text>< pictures>

I've had bad experience with the day shift the two women apologize saying the noodles were too hard so they soften the noodles it tastes really bad my past the friend could hardly eat it but the swing shift crew are very friendly and they always make sure you're happy I would avoid the day shift people they are sketchy they don't know how to please their clients.< /review><Date>1518757024458</Date><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response></record>

<text>Scammed by 50% off deal

Pho Bo was 50% off. Asked for Pho Bo, but they asked me what kind of "bo", which means beef. Said I wanted Pho Bo Vien, Beef Meatball.
Despite having "Bo" in its name, it's not 50% off. Sad part is, only ~3 pho dishes on the menu actually contain the phrase "Pho Bo" in it.

Pho is very lite and delicous. Prices are average, ~8 for large and ~7 for small< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dd262927883ceb:0x8adb63fe659dda24</gmap_id></record>

This no frills Vietnamese eatery opens from 8AM til 3AM everyday. I usually visit this place if I'm in the area after 1:30AM looking to prevent a hangover. The pho beef broth is good but I'm not a fan of the clumpy noodles so I recommend requesting fresh noodles. Every now and then their broth falls on the sweeter side which upsets me. Their crsipy stir fried noodles (pho ap chao) is a tasty choice. The pho ga's chicken broth is delicious with fresh wide rice noodles and white meat. The pho ca (fish) is also a good pho option when you're not feeling beef or chicken. Food comes out fast and hot! Overall it's a convenient stop for late night food runs and hangover cures.<//text>

I love this place, the Pho and the prices are great. Yes there is sometimes a language barrier, but that aside this is my favorite,  relaxed, little hole in the wall.<//text>

<review>Some of the BEST raw and vegan foods in the entire Bay Area! I only wish I lived closer and I could eat here every day! :)
I love the new larger space. The food is always nourishing and high vibration. I can't wait to wrap my tastebuds around some of their raw pizza!

<review>Whether or not you're a vegetarian, perhaps you're ready for a tasty vegetarian treat....This is the place! I ordered the sampler platter and the collard wrap for 2 days of food.
I will order from here each week to help them stay in business.< /review><GmapID>0x8085672676f2bab9:0x987bf2bba4c9d1a5<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I’m super excited to discover this vegan spot! Ive been feeling like the best vegan restaurants are close to the city but I will definitely be coming back here more often because I think it could possibly be the best vegan café in the bay!< /Text>

This place is awesome 👌 Im shocked at how good it was. Really really really good. If I would have known that vegan tasted this good I would have been vegan along time ago. I still eat meat but I could definitely ditch it with alternatives this good.</review>

<Text>Clean. Guilt-Free. Healthy. Wonderful Owner, and I recommend to everyone even remotely in area. So must go-to if you're in Concord.

Healthiest spot prob in East Bay.

Has some real hands on vegan chefs there. They make raw desserts for kids to see what some real food tastes like, because Mars bars just ruins your tongue's taste.

Start them young! Great place so I am glad they moved and got more seating. Great place to work so volunteer if you want to plan for resume and help out!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

We just relocated after eight years on Grant St. across from Todos Santos Park, where we were in the shawdows of Tower Grille.  We now have a larger location where we can do more than just serve healthy food. Our plan is to become a “health hub” where we offer healthy food seminars,  cooking demonstration classes, health documentary movie showings and so much more. We tried to do this at the old location but we needed more room. Hopefully you will join us during one of these events. Don’t lose hope.'}<//Response><user_id>104158025876313802883<//user_id><pictures>None<//pictures><rating>3<//rating>< name>

It's a good place to eat but it is in a really bad location. The folks that own it have a great idea they just need volume. Two doors down is a main stream restraunt that is about 15 tables that's doing Well. I'm a little concerned for the Lettuce Inn.</review>

<review>Absolutely no comparison, and I've eaten at every Vegan eatery in the Bay Area. Karen''s knowledege of nutrition, flavors, and her creativity, are what bring her dishes to life. I smile every time eat there. Whether it's the collard green crunch wrap, or the vegan taco salad, you just can't go wrong at Lettuce Inn.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>The storefront of this place is inconspicuous, so you might not run across it by chance. But if you've been lucky enough to find it online, go and give it a try! I had their vegetarian burrito, and it WAY outdid any other I've ever had (and I've had a lot of vegetarian burritos). The portions were generous, and it came with a thoughtfully done, delicious salad of a good size, all for a really reasonable price. High quality, delicious, healthful food. Try for yourself!</text>< rate>

< Review>
Stopped in seeking a healthy lunch. We got the Vegetarian Panini and the Turkey Melt. Both were decent but they were $12-$14 dollars each for a small sandwich that came with a tiny slice of watermelon and cucumber (could possibly just have been a garnish?). While we were eating outside they gave us a small juice sample which was tasty but the juices are $9.25!! That is ridiculous. Fruits and veggies thrown into a juicer is one of the cheapest and easiest things to make. The restaurant itself is tiny with no table service.

The food was good enough to come back to try more but the prices make it so I probably won't. Great for the rich of Concord looking to get robbed. Not so great for normal working people.</Review>

If it helps in the future, all of our juices are made with organic, local ingredients that taste great. We hope you always find the price worth the sip!

A gem on Todos Santos Plaza in Concord.  That stuffed avocado was amazing.  The Juicing Revelation imbedded inside also serves deliciousness.  A little expensive, but I walked away thinking it was worth it. Whole organic foods, local folks who own it . . .  a win-win.</text>

They were very helpful one day where my husband forgot his lunch and was stuck at work. They ended up delivering it to him right as they were closing. It was very sweet and appreciated.

Jerry and team were able to help me with a tricky battery situation that had to be completed in a short period of time. They were able to source the battery and replace it overnight

Thanks for the amazing service!< /Review>

<Text>I can`t imagine a car shop being better at fixing cars than All Foreign Auto Center. They are just from another space. When you get into their workshop there are machines and instruments that are futuristic and it is hard to imagine what they are for. Everything is digital and modern. I love their gadgets and the results are way better than what you would get by going to an old school car shop.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Rudy is a fantastic mechanic and person. He knows his business, and is very reasonable with pricing. Never felt like I have to argue over price or be worried about what's really being done with my car. Highly recommend! We take our Mercedes here for any and all issues and are never disappointed.<//review>

Ive been taking my BMW 328i to BMW Stevens Creek for many services & repairs. This time my car needed to have coil cylinders replaced and I was tight in fundings because planning on a vacation, so I decided to see if there are BMW shops that are trust worthy.  I gave Rudy a call at All Foreign Auto, left a voice mail and quickly returned my call, gave me a WOWee quote half of what BMW Stevens Creek. I took my car in later that afternoon. His shop is next to the San Jose HP Pavillon.  He also drove me home. Very pleasant and very caring. He called me the next day to confirm everything and later that afternoon, my BMW 328i was like in great running shape.  Awesome Job Rudy...your team also deserve a standing ovation.</text>

I have since returned for more maintenence on my car and every time they deliever.A+ for Jose and his skilled workers.my new spot for my mercedes.</Text>< pics>

I can`t imagine a car shop being better at fixing cars than All Foreign Auto Center. They are just from another space. When you get into their workshop there are machines and instruments that are futuristic and it is hard to imagine what they are for. Everything is digital and modern. I love their gadgets and the results are way better than what you would get by going to an old school car shop.<//Review>

The utmost best place for BMW repair. For those of us who love eastern European cars, as any other imported goods there some times is a real issue with finding proper support for it. All Foreign, on the other hand are exactly the help in maintaining such a car. Wonderful drew, well acquainted with with the inner workings for a lot of EU vehicles. Top notch you got problems, they got the solutions!< /Review>

<Text>Ive been taking my BMW 328i to BMW Stevens Creek for many services & repairs. This time my car needed to have coil cylinders replaced and I was tight in fundings because planning on a vacation, so I decided to see if there are BMW shops that are trust worthy.  I gave Rudy a call at All Foreign Auto, left a voice mail and quickly returned my call, gave me a WOWee quote half of what BMW Stevens Creek. I took my car in later that afternoon. His shop is next to the San Jose HP Pavillon.  He also drove me home. Very pleasant and very caring. He called me the next day to confirm everything and later that afternoon, my BMW 328i was like in great running shape.  Awesome Job Rudy...your team also deserve a standing ovation.<//Text>< Resp>

<review>I just picked up a Mercedes,it needed new break pads rotors and sensors so I started calling places and getting quotes,I read all foreign autos reviews and decided to give them a try since the MB dealership was quoting me over $1000 for everthing parts and labor.i called them and spoke to Jose, and he gave me a quote that noone else I called could beat.the next Friday I scheduled an  appointment to do the break job.i asked if they offered shuttle service (since I work like half a mile from their location) and Jose gladly offered it. dropped off my Mercedes around 1030am.shuttle took me back to work and picked me up when I got off at 3pm.got back to my car, paid and left effortlessly. they did a great job to my breaks while providing great customer service.
I have since returned for more maintenence on my car and every time they deliever.A+ for Jose and his skilled workers.my new spot for my mercedes.</review>< Pics>

<review>Food was great! Would recommend it. I, myself will be going back. Reason I gave it a 4 was because service could've been better. It was early and not a lot of customers. Server didn't come check on us not even once.<//review>< pics>

My girlfriend and I visited Cojutepeque for breakfast, as we were in the area. We both ordered the Salvadoran breakfast which merely consists of eggs, beans, plantains, and cream. Considering that there were only like 4 other patrons in the restaurant, the ~40 minute wait was too long for such a simple dish. The food itself was pretty decent aside from the fact that my eggs were slightly raw. Service was decent.</Review>

The food tastes good and prices are reasonable.  That would be the main reason we keep coming back... Otherwise, they lack customer service.  They are always "shortstaffed".  Be ready to wait for utensils until your food is already cold, and to get the waiter's attention you have to stand up at the entrance of the kitchen.</Text>

Got a little tummy... good luck getting into the seat. Benches and tables are bolted down so you can't move them. Good service.

<Review>(Translated by Google) Too late for a coffee fee, then I asked for an order of bananas and it also took a lot of courtesy. I asked the waitress to put it on my take-out, but her attitude was so bad that she pulls my plate and throws it on another table! The attitude is very bad hopefully improve in the staff

(Original)
Muy tardado para una tasa de café luego pedí una orden de plátanos e igualmente se tardo mucho cortésmente le pedí ala mesera que mejor me lo pusiera para llevar pero su actitud fue tan mala q me jala el plato y lo tira en otra mesa !!

<text>My wife is retiring from teaching in June after 40 years. We decided to celebrate at Maui in October. We were told we can rent equipment for snorkeling, but I felt uncomfortable during these times using the equipment. I went online, discovered Scuba.com. I purchased masks, snorkels and fins for reasonable prices. Everything has been delivered on time has exceeded our expectations. Great prices, timely delivery and fantastic communication.

Dave was super helpful with great customer service!   Very friendly and reassured all the customers that he would be right with them; not leaving anyone unnoticed.  Got us our answers and equipment quickly and efficiently. Great prices and deals with scuba gear!  Got to order online for a great deal, then come to the store and exchange for the items that we ordered the wrong sizes-hassle free! Would highly recommend!<//Text>

Arthur helped me with my "shock" of learning that every time I get my tanks filled even at the same place on the same day of jumping off the boat I have to get that content sticker replaced when diving Enriched Air...!  And he provided me with the information of what I need to do to have my 120 steels converted over to Enriched Air tanks!  Appreciated his time!</review>

<text>Great easy fast service! I already paid my cart and saw another item I wanted. I contacted workers and even though it was off hours, they sent me a rapid response saying they could combine everything. Arthur was very professional and helpful. I have ordered from scuba before and even drove to the building to pick up items. Always fast and friendly service. The workers definitely know their stuff! Thanks again! I love this company!<//text>< Pics>

First time visiting the store and Darrick was such a big help. With such a big inventory online he helped search for everything I needed, better priced items & open box items at a discount. He was able to find everything and more. Very fast service, helpful & polite! Worth coming into the store to get that great customer service. Thank you!</Review>

Arthur, I sent you a separate email.  Thanks.

Shared this on Yelp as well.

First, I want to start by saying I do not like giving negative feedback.  I think everyone has had bad days!  But I would expect a company to keep their promises and commitments and if they can't that they come up with a creative solution.

I have never had a problem with scuba.com when it was owned by the former owner, and I have never had problems with their, now, sister company Leisurepro.  They are now both owned by Adorama.  I have spent literally over $4,000 over the last 8 months with scuba.com and it is my most recent purchase that has caused me to write this review.  I share the amount I have spent, no to brag, but to put into context that I did a lot of business with scuba.com

My last (and final) purchase from scuba.com was a steel HP80 that had to be shipped from their sister store back in New Jersey.  This was right before the COVID-19 thing happened.  I was going to pick it up at the store but because the store was closed, I had directed UPS that I would pick up the tank directly from UPS's OC hub (UPS tried to deliver twice to their store but could not deliver it, so I was trying to be empathetic and not have UPS have to ship it back to Leisurepro and then for Leisurepro to accrue additional freight to ship it back to me).  This was in March.

Part of the purchase of the tank was they would assemble the tank, do the VIP, and fill the tank.

When I called their customer service at the beginning of the week (6/22), I was told that their new location in Costa Mesa would not be open till August.  Well, I would like to go diving and would love to use my new tank to do so, and really do not want to wait till August!  So I called again today (6/25) and wanted to know if I could take the tank to another LDS which was open to do the VIP, assembly, and air fill, and if scuba.com could credit the $15 to my account.

The instructor first did not understand what I was talking about, and after some clarification on my end, he offered to put it together but that they could not fill the tank as their new location did not have a compressor.  I again asked if I could go and get the thing done by another LDS and have them credit my account.  Which the instructor just repeated what he told me before.  Also, he noted that the tank should have a "red shark" label on it indicating that the tank had VIP.  I told him that I had not even opened the box so did not know if it did have the label.  Well, after the call I did open the box and the tank did not have a Red Shark label on it, so I guess it did not have a VIP.

I got frustrated and told him that he had lost my business for good and that I would not do any more business with scuba.com.

I wish the company well, and I realize that my experience may not be the same experience others will go through.  But I thought I would share my experience.  Thanks for reading this lengthy review!!!<//Text>

Darrick was great answering my questions regarding the Mares 8/6/5 cold water wetsuit.  His provided information about sizing not mentioned, and informed me that this particular product was currently out of stock. Would have been totally bummed if I purchased without this information.

<review>Quick and easy to get the correct information for sizing and product type.  Not everyone is built the same and locating the sizing chart and correct size on the website was weirdly difficult and vague.  Customer assistance was a great help and well worth the small effort it took to get the right information for me.    Live the adventure!   Happy New Year!<//review>< Rating>

<text>As a first time buyer of a wetsuit, this company has totally made a great first experience for me! Tom, the instructor who helped me with customer service, was literally the coolest guy I’ve ever had the pleasure of buying something from. He was helpful, quick, and really took the time to help me pick something that was absolutely right for me. I own my own business and I know there are plenty out there who do not give customer satisfaction a second thought, and Tom went above and beyond my expectations! He was polite on the phone and answered any questions I had. I recommend buying from them 1000x over and they will be the only place I call in the future! Thanks so much!</text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1536696032183, 'text': "Thank you so much for your kind words, Oliver!

I had the opportunity to "chat" with Arthur on-line regarding the sizing of a wetsuit.  His response was rapid and precise.  I have utilized other companies "chat" functions previously, Scuba.com and Arthur ranks on top of the list.  Would highly recommend.<//Review>

Arthur worked iwth me and dug through numerous options trying to find an appropriate wetsuit for both of my sons.  Even after I had placed an order, Arthur continued to look for a better solution for my other son and emailed me shortly afterward with additional options.

There are times you call companies and you're just another number. Not with this company! Tom,  in particular, provided exceptional customer service going above and beyond. Not only did he follow up with a phone call letting me know it was taking longer than he expected to hear back from the manufacturer, but he then continually kept me informed about the availability of the product and the estimated delivery date once the manufacturer got back to him. Tom - thank you for actually caring and for your time! This means more to me than you know.</Text>

My experience with this company will keep me coming back! Ordered my husband a wetsuit, arriving quicker than anticipated, just in time for his birthday.  I have decided to buy myself a new wetsuit, too and as I searched online, I had some questions... had the pleasure of chatting with Dave via online chat and I was very very impressed! Quick response and very helpful! You guys deserve more than 5 stars. Thank you, Dave!< /Review>

Christina was amazing. She was very detailed and knowledgeable about all the dive products. Her attention to detail about  the equipment I needed was outstanding. She truly knows the products and makes suggestions based on your personal needs! She provided outstanding customer service with a great attitude!

I called the shop because I ordered the wrong size. Didn’t have order number either. Darrick answered looked up my order super fast sent me an email with return instructions while we were on the phone. Even went over sizing chart to double check my adjustment for the exchange. Super fast super easy. This is what customer service is supposed to be like.<//Review>

I dropped by to check out snorkel equipment for a family reunion Hawaii trip and was thoroughly impressed with the customer service.  Miguel brought out multiple masks for me to try on and provided great advice on proper fit etc.  I understand that I am not the target audience and was blown away by how helpful and patient Miguel was.  I also appreciated that Miguel explained the benefits of better masks but did not try to upsell me on products above my needs.  I purchased equipment for my family and will refer my extended family as well.  Thanks!< /Text>

All I can say wow!  I spoke to Tom for help with some snorkeling equipment and you just don't get this level of excellent service from most retailers.  Tom helped me put together a nice snorkeling package for my son in law that was well priced and quality gear.  Very impressed and will not hesitate to recommend these folks to others as well as using them for any of my scuba/snorkeling equipment needs in the future.</Review>

I cannot RAVE enough about how great my experience was! Darrick was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I know nothing about dive gear and he helped me pick out the perfect Christmas gift for my hubby. I’ll be a loyal customer from here on out! Thanks SCUBA team!!!</Review>

<Text>Easy to browse, try on and purchase products right from their warehouse in Irvine. Although it was a little confusing at first because there wasn't anyone up front; you just follow signs to the self-help laptops. Makes sense though because this location is mainly a warehouse to ship all their online orders.</Text>< Resp>

I  just ordered a Henderson wet skin online. I read reviews &   Referred  to sizing chart. All were well defined & detailed. This place looks good & I ordered.   I am going to dive Cozumel spring break.  Within five minutes I got a call from Derek telling me they were out of my size in that particular suit, he suggested another letting me know it was less expensive and would be here on time for my trip.  WOW....talk about perfect response time & customer service.   I am impressed!  I don’t have my suit yet, he told me it would be here in 4 days. If it fits I’m not shopping anywhere else.  I’m excited!< /review>

<review>I was in the market for a 5 mm full wet suit. The one that I had wanted was on back order and would not arrive in time from my trip. Dave was very helpful in assisting me to find an alternative and in comparing the pros and cons of each. I was impressed by his knowledge and expertise in this area. I received the wetsuit quickly and it was just what I needed.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rating>

Dive Instructor Dave was VERY helpful.  I had selected some snorkeling gear but I wasn't 100% sure that it was exactly what I needed based on where I was going to be snorkling.  Not only did Dave confirm my choices, he further indicated that I had planned to purchase a higher quality fin, which he would have recommended anyway.  He also helped me understand my eye Rx so that I could order the right lenses for my new mask.  Additionally, he helped build a set for under $100 for our rental guests to use so that they would have a great experience.

Well done, Dave.  Dive on!< /Text>

<review>Just getting ready to become a new diver and had a few questions to purchase some of my gear. I joined the online chat and chatted with dive instructor Dave. Was interested in a couple different BCs and after chatting unlike most sales people he suggested the cheapest of the 2 models. For reasons other than just to make a sale. It was more of a slim line construction and would be more comfortable and all that I needed for my diving needs. Thank you Dave and will be making several more orders from you!</review>< Pictures>

I purchased a wetsuit that was backordered, so I called and they emailed a list of in-stock suits that they could ship the same day. Customer service even gave me faster shipping so I could use the needed gear for a upcoming dive. Great service and communication.<//text>

<text>I ordered 2 Lycra jumpsuits.I live in Canada and they arrived fairly quickly. It would have been sooner if it wasn't for Canada Customs. They do their best to screw things up by holding parcels, much longer than is necessary. But Scuba were very accommodating and apologized for the delay, even though they had no control over it. The suits and the service were fabulous. Thank you.</text>< pics>

I was in the market for a 5 mm full wet suit. The one that I had wanted was on back order and would not arrive in time from my trip. Dave was very helpful in assisting me to find an alternative and in comparing the pros and cons of each. I was impressed by his knowledge and expertise in this area. I received the wetsuit quickly and it was just what I needed.< /Review>

<Text>I ordered a travel bag and they advised that it was on back order. I'm leaving soon on vacation and need the bag. Tom understood the situation and offered another bag much better than the one I ordered. I'm very impressed that they offered a solution, many companies these days don't do that. Kuddos to Tom for going the extra mile, understand my situation and offer a solution. I really do appreciate it.   Thanks, MARIA</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

The staff that work with me are always responsive and professional. I usually use chat, and Dive Instructor Arthur is always kind, knowledgeable and quick to respond. He has great background knowledge of all of the equipment I buy. I plan on purchasing gift certificates for my dive buddies because - why go to another site?

Tom was able to find another wetsuit  since the one we ordered was out of stock & it the new one would ship out today. He was very friendly and helpful over the phone.  He said he has the same wetsuit. We appreciate the great service. We usually get it the next day. My husband uses his wetsuit for work so we've gone through a lot of wetsuits. We've had really good luck w/ your website & we refer you all of the time. Thanks again</Text>

Scuba is trustworthy, I am about to learn free diving, but I don't know how to buy diving equipment, or even make a wrong order. Dave patiently solves all my problems and tells me that free diving can't use extra oxygen and I get DCS problem. . It is highly recommended that everyone know about Scuba because they are always there. Thanks Dave.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I went in as a person brand new to scuba diving with no knowledge of gear whatsoever. I needed to buy a mask, fins, snorkel, gloves, and boots for my scuba class, so I went in just to get some advice on what to buy and how to buy. Miguel was super nice about showing me different types of masks and fins at different price points and his recommendations. He spent a good 45 minutes with me and my girlfriend just talking about gear. Another local dive shop basically gave us the cold shoulder when we went in to seek advice only. We were so satisfied with Miguel's customer service and the shop's selection of gear that we decided to come back a few days after and purchase from them even though we aren't taking our classes with them. Great products at solid price points with excellent customer service. Would recommend this place to anybody looking to buy scuba gear!< /Review>< pictures>

I went into the store and Dave was very helpful.   I lost my Atomic mask today and he found an exact replacement for $40!  It was used but looked brand new.   Nice store front that let's you browser inventory on computer.  Place in your cart and press the service button.  2 minutes later a guy comes with your items to try out.  Great service.</Text>

<user_name>Jay & Kathy Fenske</user_name><Time>1556817898661< /Time><rate>5< /rate><review>I ordered a couple of items.  The items in stock were shipped immediately and arrived on the other side of the country (Virginia) in just a few days.  One item that I ordered was on back order.  I was immediately notified of the status and the expected delivery date.  Unfortunately, the new deliver date was the same day that I was leaving for a scheduled dive vacation (and I wanted the item for that trip).  I emailed the shop, explained my situation, and asked about the possibility of expedited shipping.  They offered to ship the remaining item via priority shipping, thus getting it to me in time for my trip, and they did so at no additional cost to me.  I am very pleased with their price, selection, and customer service.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.</review>< Pics>

Being new to the scuba world, I was very overwhelmed by the many brands of suits! I was trying to find a good quality suit and Tom did just that. He was so helpful and knowledgeable about the different brands, as well as, took the time to explain and answer all of my many questions. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience so far with the Scuba company and cannot wait to receive my suit. I would defiantly recommend this company for purchasing scuba equipment.< /review>

Wow! Came by the store and had some questions and Kristina helped us out, she was awesome, the customer service was 5 star!  We also bought a 5mm wetsuit several months ago that had a zipper issue and they are taking care of it, no questions.  Very highly reccommended.<//review>

<text>when i was checking out, my item qualified for free shipping. but the system kept tacking on $7.45 s/h fee.  i started a chat session, and darrick was able to refund me that fee almost instantly. great customer service. thanks.</text>< gmap_id>

There must be a reason why I spend way to much money here. They have everything or find everything for you. Everyone is always down to answer questions and never try to sell you stuff you don't need. Great at repairs, quick and hands down some of the best prices you can find.</text>

So typical me, I was trying to order a dive watch at the last minute for a birthday present.  I ordered and received a notice that the item was on backorder about a half hour later.  I was traveling so I called customer service and spoke with Arthur.  He was amazing and found a better watch for me in stock and changed the shipping for me to overnight all over the phone in a matter of a few minutes.  The watch arrived as planed and was perfect.  Best on-line ordering experience I have ever had!  Arthur was able to keep things simple and deliver as promised!  Absolutely love this site and will use Scuba.com for all of our diving needs going forward!< /Text>

Everything I’ve ever ordered has been backordered. Great service if you can wait for your gear. The problem is that they don’t tell you it’s backordered for a week or more. In my case the least it’s been was 10 days after purchasing something that should have already arrived.< /Review>

<text>Arthur was amazingly helpful in guiding me through what wetsuit would work best with a tall thin lanky man. I'm 6 ft 140 lb, and I will now own the perfect wetsuit for my fit without having to try on 30 different suits in 6 different dive shops.
Thank you Dive Instructor Arthur!</text>< Pictures>

I have made several purchases in the last couple months and it all started because they did a return of a unused new mask that I purchased over 6 months ago. That is great customer service. I will continue to buy all my Dive equipment from Dave who I have had the pleasure to deal with on several of my purchase questions. Anyone that answers the phones is very knowledgeable and eager to help. it doesn't get much better than this place. Keep it up.< /Text>

He is very knowledgable and pleasant to talk to.
Dave- thanks a lot for your help.
I am going to place an order shortly as soon as I chose the light.
Thanks again!<//review>

It makes me so excited to get in the water and dive and use my new gadgets. I LOVE this place. I flew out here from Missouri to bring my gear in and shop!

The store has awesome displays of marine life as decorations. Shopping is convenient using laptops in store, and supplies are available as the store also serves as a warehouse for supplies. Been buying stuff here for a couple of years now. Recently stopped by to check for batteries for my Oceanic Geo 2 watch and Kristina was there to help me out. The rest of the crew were alert and helpful as well. Will be back again for my scuba gear needs!</text>

Great service and wonderful products.We purchased 2 Ocean Quest 17oz polyolefin dive suits at their recommendation. They fit great and were perfect for the 72 degree water temperature. Would recommend this service to everyone needing scuba gear.<//text>

I don't usually use the "chat" function on websites because they tend to be connected to somebody who doesn't have anything to do with the business and isn't really familiar with the product.  Arthur was a great help in straightening out a somewhat clunky order.  I wouldn't hesitate to use this feature in the future.  Great job, guys!<//review>

In the virtual sterile world of outsourced customer service orders, its so refreshing to do business with a US company.
Their prompt service and order support was superb.
>Fun transaction, would recommend to all.<

I always coach people who are not competitive athletes, to swim laps with a small goggle-mask, and most importantly, to attach a snorkel,
as it allows ease of breathing, thereby making distance swimming a breeze...

Buy your gear from these folks, and have fun!</text>

A few smudges but nothing can't be wiped off! No scratches, and the unit worked perfectly--like New! Very pleased! Will definitely shop & purchase from again! Thanks!< /text>

Had a situation that the older model wetsuit I ordered was actually out of stock...  Called customer service and spoke to Arthur - who not only told me I would be getting the newer suit model for the same price but worked out a shipping solution for me that get the suit to me before I leave!  Awesome customer service!<//Review>

<Review>Kristina is the best instructor ever!!! I met her in my first open water class and now just finished my rescue course with her and have to say I have never had a better instructor. She is kind, patient, fun, professional and has such an infectious fun loving spirit that makes you so stoked to dive. She inspires me to continue diving and to become a professional diver. She goes above and beyond to make your experience the best and really appreciate her for that! Overall if you the chance to dive or learn from her, you are a lucky individual :) xoxo<//Review><response>{'time': 1501179320424, 'text': 'Kaylee, thank you so much for sharing your experience with us!

<text>Derrick was extremely helpful. I was looking for the same fin I had in a bigger size but the fin was discontinued.  Derrick recommended a different fin which was on sale that would better fit my needs.< /text>< time>

The Scuba's customer service is the best.  I called in due to buying undersized vests by default, and Tom, a scuba instructor did helped me to exchange the right sizes at ease.  Again, thank you Tom.</text>

I couldn't make a decision on whether the sealife 4500 video light and the wide angle lens would be good fit for my current set up (DC2000 with 2500 video light, sealife strobe).  I chatted with Dave on line and he made me feel more comfortable with my decision since he also used the system I have.  To make a long story short, he was a lot of help and he was very patient with all my questions that I decided to proceed with the sale.  He even gave me a 10% discount.  This experience has made me feel that is going to be my next go-to place for my scuba gear needs.  Thanks a lot Dave< /review>

Had a situation that the older model wetsuit I ordered was actually out of stock...  Called customer service and spoke to Arthur - who not only told me I would be getting the newer suit model for the same price but worked out a shipping solution for me that get the suit to me before I leave!  Awesome customer service!</Text>

I spoke with  very nice and friendly fellow who guided me through my options. I placed the order and have had no issue since. I found that the BCD was the wrong size, sent it back and they sent me the correct size... very nice people to deal with and excellent prices and options. Thank for the help. I am sure I will be ordering again soon ...<//review>

Derrick was  attentive to the urgency of my matter. I had procured a Mask from a third party the did not include the lenses I needed. Derrick recommended a Mask that was similar that could accommodate the lenses, resolving my dilemma.<//review>

I was looking for a travel bag for my diving. But I have found it difficult to find reviews. I got to chat online with a pro about the various products to help make my decision. This was easy and very helpful.<//Text>

<Review>I placed an order that required next day shipping, I placed the order but placed the wrong address, as I used paypal they could not redirect order, and since I was about 30min from hitting shipping deadline Darrick was great in assisting with the canceling of my order so I could reorder. the reason being I had selected the final product in stock for my order. Thank you Darrick for taking care of me.< /Review>< pictures>

The only place I can buy replacement parts for my Sherwood Wisdom computer.

CSR Andrew looked after my request to replace a dead battery that came with a new computer. Within minutes [literally] of sending in my information, I received an email advising that a replacement battery was being shipped to me immediately.  Great Service, Very professional handling of my concern and immediate resolution 5 stars!</text>

I buy all of my dive gear here because the instructors are so, incredibly helpful and knowledgable, especially Chance who has helped me several times. I would recommend this store to anyone that needs some gear for the water!< /review>

Great prices and selection, no doubt due in part to their online presence, but also terrific in-store customer service.  The sales rep Chance pulled out half the stores inventory so I could try everything on, and didn't try to upsell me on a single item.  Great experience.</Text>

Just called for timeline on regulator service for my atomic; they quoted 8 weeks turn around with dropping it off at the store. WOW! At that rate I can get formally trained on how to do it myself and walk to the closest atomic supplier to pick up the parts.

Follow up 10/11/16: A representative reached out to me; and explained the delay on the timeline with the rush at the end of the season and offered an expedited service option in the event I still needed the regulatory service. Appreciate the responsiveness to customer feedback.<//Review>

We do have 2 full-time, manufacturer certified technicians offering outstanding equipment repair and service, 6 days a week.  This time of year, as the summer diving season ends, we do see an increase in the number of regulators brought and mailed in for service.   The closing of the Sport Chalet chain has also brought an increase in equipment brought or sent to us from all over the greater Southwest region.  Our technicians are working as quickly as they can, while still maintaining our high levels of quality in their work.\n\nIf you are in a hurry or have a deadline we do offer an option for expedited service, for a small fee, that will bring your equipment to the head of the line.'}</resp>< Gmap_id>

I worked with Darrick on accidentally placing two orders, instead of one. He was very friendly and even offered an opinion about the order (I wouldn't have received that from a call center or chat center).  Really enjoy good customer support.<//text>

Very helpful staff, the show room is bare, but as soon as you request an item, it is brought out to you. A different type of shopping experience, a cross between shopping through the site and being able to see the gear and ask advice from the staff.</Review>

My first order with these folks was a disaster.  That said, even after returning everything & washing my mind of the damage.  The manager Reggie stepped up when he did not have to.  Refreshing to see a company willing to admit to a mistake and take actions so that it does not repeat.  The second order was correct and timely. Highly recommend these folks, they really do care about getting you geared up for the next adventure.</review>< Pics>

<Text>THIS IS NOT A REAL SHOP. IT IS AN ONLINE STORE ONLY

Wow. This shop is a joke. Maybe they used to be worth something, but now they are useless.
Dropped a BC:reg:comp two months ago to be serviced. At first they said it would be two weeks and I was 3rd in line (two services ahead). Two weeks later I call and they say the part is in it's been cleaned and it might be a few more days. Today I call and NO WORK HAS BEEN DONE  I am apparently still second in line!!! The excuse "it's just the season" well it was another season when I dropped it off. You only serviced a single unit in that time period? Or did you bump other people in front of me?!

Apparently they don't have a dive instructor or anyone who fixes equipment. This should be known as an online store ONLY THEY DO NOT SERVICE EQUIPMENT.</Text>< gmapID>

I am a wish granter for make a wish illinois, and was seeking snorkeling gear for my 10 yr old wish child heading to italy to snorkel for the first time.  I rarely, if ever have utilized the chat opportunity..but seeing how I have never purchased gear for a 10 yr old, it made good sense.  Derrick was super knowledgable, patient and caring!  I appreciate the great service!<//Review>

I recently ordered the Scubapro Seawing Nova from these guys.  I spoke to Dave via their chat function and he was fantastic!  Having the ability to pick the brain of a dive instructor is incredibly valuable when picking out gear.  It's not as if you get to try your gear out and THEN decide.  no test drives with scuba gear, so i find it to be incredibly valuable to pick the brain of an expert.  I should also mention that Dave wasn't showing me the most expensive gear,  he was just showing me the gear he felt would best enhance my dives.  Dave is the man!!< /review>

Ordered a couple scuba bags in hopes they were the same Atlantic bag we used for training, but when we got them it was the Atlantic Free Diver bag which is much longer and wouldn't hold all of our gear.  I followed the steps to get an RMA# and was going to exchange it for different bags but I ended up just ordering them without the exchange because we needed them by a certain date. I emailed CS and they switched my exchange to a refund without any hassle...it is very much appreciated!!  Can't wait to order more!< /review>

Very helpful staff, the show room is bare, but as soon as you request an item, it is brought out to you. A different type of shopping experience, a cross between shopping through the site and being able to see the gear and ask advice from the staff.<//Review>

I got online at Scuba.com and hit the Chat link and it wasn't even 15 seconds and Darrick was there to answer my questions about masks and snorkels. This is the kind of customer service a company should have. Thank you.<//text>

I placed an order on Thursday July 16th for three items 2 pairs of gloves and 1 pair of wet suit pants. I needed these items by the following Friday for an upcoming trip. The web site states that all orders will be shipped the next day. This did not happen. On Monday July 20th I received an email that one pair of the gloves were not in stock. I told them to take it off the order and ship the remainder. Kevin told me that they would ship it 3 day since they had not shipped it on Friday so it would get here for my upcoming trip.Fantastic!  It did not arrive on Thursday so I called and spoke to Bob. He told me it had not been shipped but he would overnight it to me so I would have it by Friday. Terrific!  It did not arrive on Friday so I called and spoke to Aaron. He was very apologetic and said he would have it sent over night Saturday delivery where I was going in Florida. Unbelievable! When I arrived in Florida I received an email stating that the package had been delivered. My first thoughts were great! Shortly thereafter, I found out that it had been delivered to my address in Atlanta not the address I had given Aaron the previous day.  Obviously, I was unable to use the equipment I had ordered and I am sure they would take it back if I want to go through the effort of shipping it to them. However, the real point here is that they had four opportunities to get this right but somehow found a way to screw it up. Each time I asked what happened they blamed "the system".  It is their "system" and someone might want to take a look at it.< /Text>

<review>Phenomenal customer service! Made my order on the 8th of the month and I just got my open water class portion done and my first dives are the 18th and 19th. I got my confirmation email and it said the goggles I chose were back ordered till the 23rd, with this companies wide variety of gear to choose from I had a few other options I liked so I called to cancel my order or change to a different set and (I can’t remember this guys name off hand) the guy I talked to was extremely nice and helpful! He gave me an option that was very similar but I had a few other options in mind so I said I would call back to change the order. I called back and spoke with Dave, and Dave showed me another option that was very similar to the one I had originally picked out with a better lense and on sale! To say the least, customer service was top notch and very helpful! They definitely have my future business< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

My order was back-ordered from the company so I started a chat to check on it. I had the pleasure of getting Dave who ROCKS!!!  Not only was he nice and found out what was going on with my order but since he could not get it to me by me next dive, he upgrades my BCD and overnighted it to me. Thank you again Dave. You have a customer for life now.</Review>

< Review>
They messed our order up pretty darn bad (even lied to us ) and we did not have our things in time and the day we had to leave for our trip we had to drive to OC  hours away from our house to get some of our order. We really had Zero time for this. And the gas price to drive there was just stupid!
We have been customers for 13 years, and they are really getting bad. We decided Not to buy with them any more. Very dissapointed.<//Review>
<pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1508887065130, 'text': 'Our tail is totally between our legs on this order.  We are very sorry we were unable to get it to you in time.  We discussed with you we would try but couldn’t guarantee the specialized mask with lenses would be in time for your vacation.  We offered a different  mask and lens solution but those were turned down.  Upon receiving the first mask and lenses from the vendor one of the optical lenses was chipped.  In order to accommodate your wishes we shipped the mask with lenses to your first vacation destination only for it to be held up in Puerto Rico longer than the first leg of the trip.  Unfortunately, Puerto Rico has been devastated by hurricanes causing major delays.  We were trying to have another mask reach you for the 2nd destination of your trip but after countless hours on the phone with both FedEx and UPS there was no way to have the packaged cleared for customs without going through Puerto Rico.   We are all divers here and we completely understand you wanted to don a mask that will help you see better underwater.  Due to unfortunate circumstance after unfortunate circumstance there was no way to get you the specialized mask with lenses in time.  Again we are very sorry we were unable to help you with this mask and we apologize for any inconvenience we have caused you.  Despite the mask issue we hope you still had a fantastic trip!'}<//response>< Gmap_id>

I was looking to buy a wetsuit as a Christmas present for my Niece. I dont have any of her measurements other than her weight and height. I also dont know anthing about diving gear or apparel. I was pleased to see on their website that they have an option to live chat. I was quicly connected with an experienced dive instructor named Darrick and told him what I was looking for as stated above. I also told him I was looking for a suit in the price range of $60-100. Given the limited info he suggested a wetsuit which turned out to be perfect. It was right at $100 and he told me to get a Medium. I had been on other sites browsing and came upon different size charts. With the input of my niece's w&h on three different sites I was given three different size abbreviations....8-9, 10, & x-small. I relayed that info back to Darrick with the question of why he suggested to get a Medium. He told me in detail what the size charts mean and what's most important. He then posted a link for the wetsuit he suggested which was extremely helpful as I had no idea what to look for.
I was very impressed with his knowledge and more impressed with how quick he responded to my questions over a live chat. All the live chats I've been on take so long to get a response or I was disconnected. I would definitely refer this site to anyone who wants to get scuba gear and real time advice and suggestions if needed. Helpful, courteous, and easy.<//Text>

These guys have a great selection of products and prices. But the customer  service is just sooo poor! They sent me wrong order, i sent the order back and never got my correct order delivered as they promised. Everytime i called i get a different story,
"we don't have your order",
"Your order is lost"
"The responsible department is not answering"
"Bs bs bs.." and they never admitted that they screwed up my order or said sorry.
I drove there to pick it up because they were soo uncompetent to do it them selves.<//text>

I highly recommend finding a local dive shop, don't buy from this company online - if you have an issue, they won't stand behind making it right.

My experience was horrible. Mares BC was rigged improperly with a splitter on air supply to inflater and gauges which introduces an additional failure point. Naturally, this failed and instead of waiting weeks for them to warrant, I got it fixed for $100 at local dive shop. 15 dives later, the inflater button failed and constantly fills BC with air.

I email customer support and expect them to make it right but no response for a week. I call and after 5 minutes on hold, am connected to someone who tells me Mares only has 1 year warranty. I point out their website says 2 years and he agrees. Based on all the issues and lack of response, I ask for a new inflater hose to be drop shipped so I can make a dive next week and am offered - you can send it to us, we'll mail it to Mares and get the warranty work done - should take about 4 weeks after Mares receives it.

The rep says "yeah, I understand, sorry but that all we can do". Headed to local dive shop to pay for 2nd repair on 1 year old BC.< /Text>

What else could a diver ask for?  Thanks for taking care of me and I look forward to my next purchase with you all.<//Review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) 10,000 km away and do not realize it.
The kind of staff, especially of Arthur, did not make me realize that I was talking to the other head of the world. Few times I have found such competence and speed in an online chat.
Certainly a company from which to buy with confidence.
Thank you guys. And if you pass from Imperia, to Italy, send me an email: it will be a pleasure to take a dip, with your new equipment !!!

10.000 km di distanza e non rendersene conto.
La gentilezza dello staff, specialmente di Arthur, non mi ha fatto accorgere che stavo parlando con l'altro capo del mondo. Poche volte ho constatato una simile competenza e rapidita in una chat on line.
Certamente una azienda da cui acquistare con fiducia.
Grazie ragazzi. E se passate da Imperia, in Italia,  inviatemi una email: sarà un piacere fare un tuffo, con la vostra nuova attrezzatura!!!
