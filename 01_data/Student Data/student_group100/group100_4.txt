Great coffee shop! Friendly workers and nice environment.

Excellent organic locally roasted coffee. One of the best cappuccinos around, never burned like some of the other places.

Their baked goods are unique and delicious as well,   If you have a chance to try the blackberry bar do it! You won’t regret it.< /review>

<text>Great coffee, beautiful location. Baked goods are quite good with the exception of the scones which are bland. I ordered one of everything and I found the other baked selections wonderful. Including the raspberry pie bars and cheese cake.< /text>< Pictures>

Nice loose leaf green tea and great tasting coffee. Very friendly baristas and we really enjoyed the environment. Photos and art on the walls, a hand made kayak shop in the back, 1920's jazz playing, and lots of touches that give this place a lot of character and makes it one of the more memorable coffee shops we've visited. The town is beautiful to walk around on a soft morning.< /Review>< pics>

The espresso is devine. I was nervous when I ordered a few extra shots this morning, but it was so smooth. My kids enjoyed the pastries.

Something for everyone!

Love the eclectic decor and art. I hope to come back when it is fully open.< /Review>

<text>Went to get pastries and hot chocolates for the family, but left when none of the customers were wearing face masks. You can't expect much better from boomers, but bummed that employees weren't asking folks to follow the "wear a mask" sign on the door.

Unique, fun setting with a piano and violin available for any musician to play.  I also had the best latte of my entire trip to the North coast, which included their homeade syrups, and the owner was really friendly, and willing to answer questions.   If you're looking for a locally owned coffee shop with excellent coffee this is your place!<//review>

If this is the place I think it is, they had the yummiest muffins and the most unique restroom with goldfish in a porthole in the wall and other unique amenities!<//Text>

This was such a cute place. My husband and I really liked mind's eye. We each ordered a cafe mocha with extra whipped cream and we shared a cream scone with blackberry jam. We sat by the fireplace and read the newspaper.   Check out the restroom if you get a chance to. It was one of those that has the water tank with the pull chain up high. It's actually quite an interesting restroom. A lot going on and worth checking out it feels kind of haunted. Mine's eye is walking distance to everything downtown old Town. We will definitely visit the next time we are in Ferndale.</text>

Great place run by great people. The vibe they got going is one I have yet to find in any other shop, even my own. This is the shop where I first had that "AHA" moment with coffee. Great drinks, great baked goods.<//review>

I'm not sure if it is an actual menu item but I ordered something called Princess Jasmine...........THANK YOU!  I think I ordered it hot but it may also come iced? I love jasmine teas with alternative milk like almond or coconut that have a good jasmine flavor and a light level of sweetness. They are not easy to find. I thought this was FANTASTIC in flavor. Great stuff guys! Please keep it around! :)</Text>

Really excellent coffee at a reasonable price.  This place is comfortable,  with a friendly feel.  The regulars are greeted by name entering and leaving.  While the brewed drinks are slow getting out,  they have an urn of pre- made coffee with instructions to leave your money in the tin. Essentially an Express lane. I prefer the brewed selections which are really superior to almost anywhere I've tried.<//text>

Stopped here while in town for a wedding. The coffee was fantastic and the staff friendly. Definitely a cool shop! Loved seeing the handmade boads from the workshop at the back of the store! The vintage cash register was a cool touch too. Be aware they have one size option for drinks so no venti large small grande craziness.</review>

Coffee is delicious!  Great ambiance to sit with friends or by yourself.  They even offer a woodworking class behind the soundproof  glass wall of the coffee shop.</Review>

Took a while to get coffee which allows for some time to eyeball the knick knacks. The coffee is via pour-over and very good so worth the wait. Tea selection was all but nonexistent.<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Superb little town very peaceful from another time.
We had a little coffee in mind's eye which was very good, handcrafted, the pastries are also very good, a great stop before hitting the road.

(Original)
Superbe petite ville très paisible d'un autre temps.
Nous avons pris un petit café au mind's eye qui été très bon, fabrication artisanale, est les pâtisserie sont très bonne également, un super stop avant de reprendre la route.</Review>< pics>

<review>Perhaps we tried this on an off night.  There's something about the dough that's off.  The crust and the garlic knots were not good.  Crust was too well done.  The garlic knots were cooked just right, but tasted very dry.  So the food alone, I give them 3 stars.  I knocked another star off because they didn't prepare the pizza right.  They took my phone order correctly (sausage and mushroom) as shown to me on the order slip, but ended up putting pepperoni instead.  The person helping said it happens sometimes when they are busy.  Thus the free garlic knots.  We wanted to really like this place and decided to try it and skip our regular spot, now we'll just be going back to our regular spot.< /review>< name>

It's a good place to order from. Pizza is really good. Prefer this pizza over bigger chain location's. Phone and in house assistance from staff needs work but food is good.<//review>

Born and raised in NYC and tbh their pizza is alright. I wouldn't call it NY style but somewhat close. (Not really). I order a large pie with the hope of getting a NY style pizza and tbh the cheese tasted a little funny like it was expired 2 days ago. The chicken wasn't fresh and it tasted something you ate at elementary school cafeteria. Friendly staff but I wouldn't get my hopes up if you are expecting NY style pizza. Just my 2cents..<//review>

This place is SO GOOD!
Try it guys!
If it wasn’t for COVID, I might not discover this little gem in Arcadia.

Give it a try, fresh thin dough. Great sauce, fresh ingredients!<//Review>

This place is hidden gem, their medium pizza served 3. We tried bbq chicken which came with ample toppings. Definitely recommend it for low budget happy dinning. Good value for money</Text>

I was apprehensive of this spot, after looking at the prices and some of the other negative reviews. I decided to take a chance because I was really craving a good calzone (insert Parks & Rec meme). Having used to work at a family-owned NY/NJ style that made calzones, my standards were set pretty high.

When I got my order of knots and the calzone, I was blown away. The Calzone itself was baked to perfection, the toppings were plentiful and the cheese gooey. Not to mention the seasoning on top to finish it off was nothing short of BEAUTIFUL. The knots were a bit smaller than I'd hoped for being 4 dollars but what they lacked in size they made up for in taste and seasoning. Marinara sauce is nothing to write home about but it's much better than the chains. The (presumably) homemade ranch was a little thicker than I would have liked but nonetheless was great. All in all, I'll be ordering here again. You guys have blown me away as a first time customer, well done lads.< /review>

My boyfriend and I decided to try Omar's during quarantine and now we get it twice a month. It would be more if I had the metabolism lol. I honestly can't speak for the pizza because I got their italian calzone and it was so good everytime we order i get it again. My boyfriend loves the spaghetti and their garlic knots are also delicious. 10/10 would recommend! 👌 👍</review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>We ordered a pizza on the phone. When I went to pick it up he told me to wait cause it wasn’t ready. Since we are on quarantine I waited outside. That’s when a guy came bringing back a pizza. The worker than said ok your order is ready and tried to give me the returned pizza. He said he accidentally gave my pizza to the wrong customer but that it’s all there and the guy brought it back for me! Are you kidding me! I said you cannot give me a returned pizza and asked for my money back! The worker was very upset with ME!</review><name>Tonia Patino<//name>< Response>

Just found this place since my buddy wanted some pizza. Found it on Yelp, read the reviews and gave it a shot. The pizza tasted great. It was New York style pizza and the sauce and toppings had a ton of flavor.  I only wished I ordered another pizza.</Text>

<Review>Just discovered this place and it is great!

The building is nondescript, but the interior is clean, well lit and has the ambiance of a traditional pizza/Italian place.

The pizza is fantastic, with excellent crust, tasty sauce and very generous toppings. Seriously, the pizza is COVERED in toppings!

Prices are very fair for the amount of food you receive, and the service was fast.

I loved my first experience here and can't wait to go back!</Review>< gmap_id>

Won’t recommend!!They didn’t make the pizza as I ordered and the cook even repeated the order correctly and still the pizza was wrong and then started to argue about it and get very rude and disrespectful towards me! He even started to talk down to me like I was stupid! I don’t know what happened to this place it went down hill!</text>

<review>This place is good. Their pizza is exceptional, one of the best in the area. Their other items are pretty good too and they are priced right to make Uncle Reds a great choice for a week night take out dinner when it's too late or you are too tired to cook.  The ingredients taste very fresh and not overly greasy or salty.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Pizza quality has gone downhill. The dough tastes pre made or frozen. How I long for the days when guys would hand toss he dough.
Not what it used to be!</review>

Edited Review:
Knocked them down to a three, thanks to the owner. Made a rude, snarky comment saying I owe him money because his employee under-charged me by $5 the week before. I'm leaving my original review below, because it is good pizza; but, the business lost my 2-3 orders per week because of the owner.

Amazing food accompanied with great service.  So far, I've eaten their buffalo wings, calzone, pizza, and salad.  Wings have a different spice and kick than other restaurants.  Calzone and pizza portions are large and valuable.  Salad is only thing I can't rave about, it's a regular traditional green salad topped with red onion, olives, and tomatoes. Definitely my favorite pizza in my area and a must try.</review>

<review>Very good pizza, tasty crust, cheesy, and good topping distribution. The chicken wings were great, crispy skin and good sauce, way better than I usually expect from a pizza place. Delivered just when they said they would. Would order again.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2dbddf4c92843:0x30051541cd2b9e9b<//Gmap_id></record>

This place used to be Uncle Reds, and it was amazing. New owners and new business name unfortunately also came with menu changes. The price for toppings is crazy once you taste the quality of the ingredients.   To bulid your own pizza is pricy and not worth the extra money. This place does not make the cut any longer< /review>

My new go to pizzeria place in town. The food I had were all one of the best. Calzone, alfredo pasta, lasagna were so full of flavor and delicious. Their marinara sauce... I am drooling as I think about it again. I took out a star because the food took too long to come out in the hall. The guy was very nice to apologize about it though. However, I think I will go back for the food. It s worth the waiting.</text>

Greetings from the Hampton Inn Hotel in Arcadia!!!  If you want good pizza, then this is the place. The pizzas are delicious and they are very generous with their toppings. I really recommend Uncle Red's pizza to our guest before any other pizza restaurant.... Thank you Alberto for making great pizzas!!!</text>

<Review>I owned a pizza place in for over 23 years and I'm constantly on the look out for good pizza. This place was kind of hard to find but it's worth the effort, great pizza! The best crust, tasty pizza sauce and lots of cheese.< /Review>< pictures>

Pretty nondescript place with excellent pizza. Obviously quality ingredients and generous toppings. It isn't the cheapest thing around, but you definitely get what you pay for!< /Review>

Simply follow what they say, and you'll get your guard card in no time. 1-stop shop for firearm permit and training with an introductory into weapons training. I'm said there wasn't a chicken joint nearby.</review>

called bsis and they swear they sent it like two times then they said i would have to pay for another one when i never got the any guard card

I looked up my license number online and they had my name spelled wrong and my zip code was wrong as well still no guard card in my mail box i was so excited about becoming a security guard and still to this day i have no card smh i prefer you find a professional place to get your guard training and guard card.<//Text>< Pics>

Great spot to train with probably the best prices in town. Did my pepper spray and baton training here recently and it was easy. Received both certifications same day. Laminating machine was locked away so couldn't get them laminated there and the typewriter was locked in the main office and Craig (owner) was already gone for the day. Day after a holiday so I'm not gonna knock off any stars. Everything had to be written in. She (the receptionist/assistant) said I was welcome to come back to get everything typed and laminated next day but it's not a big deal. They are valid whether typed or not. I can get them laminated for a few cents each at Fed Ex or a dollar at Staples. Easy peasy.

Staff is also welcoming and friendly. Things can get a little slow at times, but not painfully slow. Mainly a lot going on and sometimes not enough staff to attend every need. Live Scan is what takes the longest because you have to wait for the people who do the live scanning to get there. Thankfully what I came for, didn't require any live scan or state fees. But at least I know what to expect when I come in for my FireArm processing whenever the time comes.

Pepper Spray and Baton cards do not expire as long as your guard card stays valid.

I'm happy because now I can start my new position next week! In less than a month, I will also be returning to do my firearm qualification since my job will require it. Again, cheapest prices I've seen with everything included. I think it's $371 for everything including the course, the range, gun rental, ammunition, live scan and state fees. Plus they train you for like 2 calibers; any additional calibers added on are like $20 each (I THINK; but check to make sure) which is great. Re-qual is $40 per caliber I believe.

Most other places are in the $500 to $700 range for everything included and only train you for maybe 3 different calibers. Classroom course is there onsite and is walk-in welcome on any day. Range day is every Wednesday. So no matter what day you start, jusy remember that range day is always the following Wednesday.

It is completely worth it to invest in your career as a security officer, ladies and gentlemen. Getting your guard card is half the battle, because at least you can get a nice steady job. But if you want to be able to make more money, upgrade and get more licenses. It's worth it. Even getting just your pepper spray and handcuff licenses can qualify you for better paying work. CPR/First Aid is also very inexpensive here, I believe it's $40 to get the card, and $30 to renew after that. Taser license only $100.

*Update I now have my firearm license as well. It took a little longer than it was supposed to but that is no fault of American Training Academy; it is the fault.of BSIS. My background check and everything went through, but somehow they overlooked my application and forgot to push it through and send the letter for the assessment. After a few phone calls to BSIS, I was finally able to get the ball rolling and I now have my firearm license in hand, laminated and all.

Thank you, American Training Academy! See you in June or July for re-qual and to possibly add on one more caliber! I hope you get lots of business I've been referring everyone over to you guys!<//Text>

<name>lynsey serrano</name><time>1610302623126</time><review>Want your guard card, pepper spray, baton, firearm, cpr/ first-aid, taser, or handcuff certification? American training is definitely the place to go, they’re honest and have the best prices for the certification in LA!
I called first before going and craig answered the phone very professional; told me to come in and I was prepared after he mentioned the details about the training. I took the class and did my live scan for the state and right away in 2 weeks I received my guard card and right after craig directed me to a recruiter and I’m now employed with a company! and it fits into my schedule so well! I’m so glad that I walked in. This is definitely the place to go if you’re looking to become certified in the security field. Extremely friendly atmosphere and Craig is a very Diligent & Humble man, he will help you and assist you with all your questions and concerns, I promise this is the place to get certified!< /review><rating>5< /rating>< Pictures>

I told you to contact the Bureau for your status and you hung up in my face and didn't allow myself or my staff to assist you. Once again contact the Bureau at 1800 952 5210 for your status of your guard card and good luck with your security career."}</Response>

This guy Graig Montgomery has been serving the community for over 20 year. Helping young youth get jobs when most people would care less. In most cases when they couldn’t find employment. Have we all forgot how any job is better then none.

To have someone take the time to open a business in one of the most toughest areas in Los Angeles and in his own community. He better then me!!!!

So the next time you go there!!!
thank this guy for having the balls to Evan try to help our youth when most just talk!

Thanks Americana training academy< /Review>< Pics>

Told by young receptionist that I can't requal because I didn't qual the first time with them... I've qualed at several locations for as long as I've been holding my firearm permit being 8 years. It's simply a qual then sent to the bureau. I guess you just lost our business thanks to your unknowing staff<//review>

<Review>Craig is the man to go to for all your security needs, I've done event staff with him. Then after that he recommended me for a full time position as a logistics officer. Been at my new job STEADY for 6 months. And its all thanks to him, he is a straight forward person and will help you with your needs.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<userid>103154342833255487531</userid><review>After being laid off from my previous profession I needed to get back to work immediately. A friend of mines told me about All Access Security on Crenshaw. I was amazed by how quickly I completed the training and was ready to go to work as a security Officer. The training was professionally administered in a professional environment. Unlike other companies that would take your money and boot you out the door. All Access own their own Security company and was able to quickly place me on an assignment working good hours with decent pay. Thank you All Access for making the difference.< /review></record>

Iv'e been to other security companies, but after a short while i would soon see myself with no work and being unemployed due to the lack of the work, or the company somehow went out of business. I stumbled across Access Security Training Center and was immediately employed. They seemed more professional and handed my time more seriously. The training was done professionally at their own company, and made sure I knew what I needed to know before my first deployment, I valued the services they've  provided me. I would recommend others to see what they also can do for them. If you need more information, just ask for Craig.<//Review>

A cute little place for coffee with a very artistic ambience. They have spas and hot tub too. We enjoyed our stop here while on our way to redwood forest.< /Review>

Absolutely amazing. Peaceful, quiet, and relaxing. Clean and the staff were super nice. A must-do. My only regret is not getting a chance to go at night also. Half hour was plenty of time for us.<//review>

This is a delightful spot with sweet, rustic decor and a homely feel. The staff are friendly and there's even a gorgeous cat that roams around. I got a latte and headed into the hot tub with my boyfriend where we had a relaxing hour. An hour is enough, we actually got out and had to rest because it was so warm. Very relaxing and well kept tub with a button for bubbles too. There's a light so you know how much time you have left so you're not worrying about when to get out. And it's pretty cheap. Definitely recommend for relaxation or a romantic date!</review>

I love Cafe Mokka but the fact that in 2019 they still can not accept cards is unacceptable.

Over all the drinks are great and the atmosphere is fantastic. I love the redwood trees that are in next to the tub.

If you go, go for an hour, it's worth it but be ready to go through the hassle of writing a check or bringing cash.

If they add cards as a payment method, even if they charge a $1 service fee or something I will update this review to 5⭐</review>

<text>I absolutely love this spot! It’s my mini getaway and it’s seclusion makes you feel like you are actually away. It’s def an old timer feel. I wish the pond was a bit more maintained. I use both the sauna and outdoor hot tubs and love them both. I think the prices are affordable but the demand for reservations are harder to come by on Weekends and nights. Cafe drinks are also cheap and affordable.< /text>< Pictures>

Call early because they book up quick and only accept reservations 48 hours in advance.   You can book a private hot tub or sauna.   I've only done tubs.   $10 for 30 minutes and very relaxing.  My favorite time to come is during a nice rain.  Pair the occasion with a hot chocolate and you are in heaven.< /review>

Best place to relax with a loved one or partner and be in a huge hot tub or a nice sauna and be at peace with oneself! It's usually quiet and serene and the forest like setting sets u to a far away place away from all your worries. Very sought after by the locals I highly suggest you call till u get a hold of someone and book an appointment a day early or just go in and make one personally. :)<//review>

Yesterday evening there was an incident at Cafe Mokka that involved someone inflicting serious damage on the hood of my car. I attempted to reach out to management about this situation and in turn received a very dismissive and defensive response. I sincerely hope that no one else has to deal with any kind of damage to their vehicles while parked at Cafe Mokka as they do not appear receptive to these situations.
Please see attached photos for detailed screenshots of my conversation with Cafe Mokka management as well as a picture of the damage done to the hood of my car.<//review>

A beautiful place to relax and read with a coffee or tea. It has a very natural feel, with solid wood table and benches. With a coy pond and plants in a walking garden out back in a fenced space with trees, it feels like you are no longer in town. It is a great place to catch an old fashioned Finnish tub or sauna as well, as you can rent a private tub or sauna for you and your friends by the half hour. It is like a retreat just five minutes away, from anywhere in town.<//review>

I go here all the time to use the saunas! Super hot and steamy with a private shower.
The only thing I would advise against is using the hot tubs... I heard very loud, unsettling sounds and moans coming from those... O_O< /Text>

I have been to this place many times in college to soak in the tubs, that was over 10 years ago. I've been there a few times lately and it's exactly as I remembered, but I actually tried the coffee and the food for the first time and was very impressed. I think this place makes one of the best mochas and Humboldt county. I drink a lot of mochas, and this is definitely in the top two if not the number one.<//review>

<text>Amazing! Be sure to call ahead to reserve your tub or sauna. Don't be like me and hope for a cancellation. I got lucky and had a private enclosed outdoor hot tub under a Cyprus tree all to myself.  Whether or not you're a coffee purist,  American, European, or have any other cultural background; go ahead and indulge in a house made mocha with 2 shots and the house whipped cream.  I don't typically order sweet coffee but this was a very pleasant accoutrement to go with my soak. If you're going to be in the Eureka or Arcata area definitely give this place some time and stop on by. I can't wait to go back.< /text><userid>118180532255243663188<//userid>< gmapID>

The coffee is good and service is friendly and cheerful. It is a cash-only business so don't forget your bills.
The ambiance is really relaxing and their back patio area is gorgeous, with a pond and a number of benches and tables scattered about.
Their hot tubs are also amazing, though a little too expensive for frequent visits unfortunately.<//text>

Cheap, delicious quality espresso drinks. Chai w whip is also incredible. No internet, limited plug-ins, cash only, and customer service is very casual. Food OK. Tubs are quaint &relaxing. I enjoy a lot, but room for improvement. Love playing chess or sitting in yard with a drink.<//text>

<Name>Sarah Jones< /Name><time>1555680661681<//time><Rating>5<//Rating><review>A tiny Finnish style coffee house with loose leaf teas and small delectable treats both sweet and savory. Hot tubs are about 6' in diameter with wooden benches for sitting and soaking, and a small wooden deck surrounding located in their own small, private outdoor area with ferns and tree cover. Careful, it can be slippery! There are steps up to climb in the tub, but you can request a low tub if climbing stairs is a challenge for you as it is for me. There is a button to press for jets which delivery an invigorating massage through three levels of jets : upper, mid, lower back. There is an outdoor shower for your convenience and usually a pump soap dispenser for all-in-one shampoo -shower gel washing pre and post soaking. A half-hour goes by so quickly, so watch for the green light to turn to yellow so you have time to shower off if you'd like, but please get out and into your dressing room when the light turns red so that the next patrons can enjoy their full time of soaking. You can bring your own towels, or get one there for Just .50cents more. You can also bring your own supplies to make it your own experience, but please don't add ANYTHING into the hot tub such as essential oils or soaps because the next patrons may have a severe allergy and although the filters are very good, the water is only changed two days a week to conserve water.   Just awesome! Enjoy!</review>< pics>

Love the saunas here! Staff is always friendly and accomodating, yummy snacks and beverages, nice spacious outdoor area with tables around pond. Must make reservations for hot tubs or saunas one day in advance, and they only take cash, so be prepared for those things.</Review>

But when we got there I found out that they had private Hot Tub Rooms you can rent for a half hour or more for a very fair price. It was AMAZING! I will definitely be  back. They also have saunas.</Review>< Date>

Nice, cozy cafe with awesome private tubes and saunas. Do call ahead, you have to book your tub in advance. Don't eat the cheese crackers, they are pretty wierd. Still a 5/5.</Text>

Amazing cafe and spa! The cafe is built like a quaint cottage, with a fire place and live string music on some nights. Their drinks are great especially the chai tea. The Finnish hot tubs and saunas are amazing, clean and not to expensive. Cloths are optional in the spas and if you just show up for a warm drink you can always rent a towel for a spontaneous dip! They also have a lovely cat named Leonard<//Text>

Wonderful place for rejuvenation.
Great friendly staff.
Hot tubs are wood so if you are in to Vegas style pools and jaccuzi, this is not for you.
But you should try it once at least.
30 minutes is more than enough for $9.00 per hour.❤< /Text>

It's $10.25 for a half hour with the option to go full hour. Awkwardly quiet inside. Best place in all of Arcata, though, which is saying a lot.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>This place is precious, and I have never been to a cafe that felt so Swiss and atmospheric. Crazy cozy and relaxed, I dig the decor and cafe cat. Coffee and snacks are great, they do sell out of food items later in the evening, so be ready to nab what you wabt when its in the case. The exterior here is actually really lovely and it's set away from the plaza enough to feel quaintly isolated, in spite of being a block away from Richard's Goat. The hot tubs here are also fabulous and worth visiting.</Review>< Pics>

Good Coffee, great saunas and sweat rooms. The staff is friendly, and provide a cozy atmosphere to hang out and do homework, or read the paper, or a book. The building style has a unique Finnish theme complete with a grass roof. The garden in back feels like an escape from the city.<//Text>

Beverages from the cafe maybe enjoyed while soaking. Times offered of a half hour or hour rentals are convenient. Staff is friendly and courteous. They are skilled in making coffee drinks.

My wife and I attended HSU and fell in love with the hot tubs, hot chocolate, and swiss lodge ambiance. It just exudes peace and tranquility. We only get to visit Arcata about once a year now, but Cafe Mokka is always a priority. Book a hot tub or sauna early in the day, they only take same day reservations, as they fill up fast. Enjoy a relaxing soak and a splendid view of the sky.< /Text></record>

Classic pour through and German sugar lumps. Cozy Swedish conspiracy backgammon. Tinking cups and saucers over quiet intellectual murmurs. Courtyards heavy calming and makes feeling awkward difficult. Bring your kids only to show them where parents beyond counting have found one another or parted ways... Keeps depth of character that draws and holds so many to the area .
Cheers n thnx</review>

The best place ever to go and have a cup of something, a snack, play a game of chess, sit by the fire, pet the kitty (Leonard), go hot tubbing or to the sauna. It’s one of the main reasons I moved back to Humboldt, no joke. There are not many retreats like this in the world, unless you live in some amazing European country that values design and experience... book a day in advance and in person! They are very busy. When are y’all gonna expand anyway?? Lol</Review>

Cafe Mokka has been an Arcata favorite for decades. Behind the cafe, hot tub and sauna cabins surround a frog pond. The hot tubs are outdoors within privately fenced enclosures beneath the canopy of an "enchanted forest." The cafe resembles a cottage from Finland and has a cozy seating area with a fireplace. There is often live acoustic  music on the weekends in the evening. The coffee, hot chocolate, and mochas are always delicious. Both the coffee and the hot tubs are very reasonably priced.<//review>

I ❤❤❤❤❤ their chai. They know how to  make some good ass foam. The people that work there are hella nice. The entire place is breathtakingly beautiful.

I think the saunas are better than the hot tubs but that's just a personal opinion. Make sure to be hydrated before you visit tho.

All in all, one of the best places in Arcata to visit.<//review>

An excellent way to pamper yourself. Quiet, rejuvenating ambiance. Delicious cofee drinks and special chocolates, a decadent, self-romancing experience. The private saunas are an awesome experience to be had. I wish I could give 4.5 stars.

However,  public jacuzzis are contaminated by people’s choices. Beware the potential (ladies) for yeast infections, have sex after you go.... not in shared public waters, for everyone’s sake.< /Text>

Would be perfect if it weren't for cigarette smokers on the patio.   Trying to take healing bath with smoke blowing in to tub area doesn't work as well.< /Text>

The best atmosphere. Feels like an old timey tavern. Great cocoa, and they've got hot tubs for rent if that's your thing.< /Review>

This cafe has an ubber cool atmosphere. I feel like I've gone to the "leaky Couldron" or "The Inn of the Prancing Pony", but don't use the hot tubs please...They just are not sanitary enough. The locals know better.< /text>< Rating>

Robert was amazing to work with through the process.  He was dliligent and stayed in touch with us months in advance of my trade in.  When I was ready, he answered all the questions my husband and I had and went to great lengths during the busy holidays to make sure we got the deal and vehicle we wanted.  Steve in Finance was quick and efficient and made that gruesome paper signing process easy and actually fun with his conversation.  It wasn't an ideal way to spend NYE but it was quick, efficient and without issue.  I have already referred someone to the Robert and I have no problem doing it again due to his excellent work.</text>

I had a great experience with Abe! My air conditioning condenser malfunctioned and the repairs were extensive. Abe made the entire process smooth and painless! I was fortunate to work with someone who takes pride in what they do and who genuinely cares for their customers. Thank you Abe!!!<//review>

<Text>Edwin Rivera helped me with my service.  He was upbeat and very helpful.  I asked him some questions about other things I need to do with my Blazer and he was extremely helpful, offering a number of suggestions.  It's a pleasure to visit Sierra Chevrolet for my service and another reason that I'm happy with my first Chevy purchase.  Edwin really deserves a pat on the back.</Text>< pics>

My new car purchase experience was great. I couldn't be more satisfied. Thanks to Jose the sales rep that sold me my car and Steven from finance for explaining all the financing in details, as well as everyone else at Sierra chevy that help me that day. Thanks for making this purchase easy.< /Review>

I was a little disappointed that after I purchase my new vehicle I got home and realized it had no floor mats  I really don’t think the dealership should’ve let the car leave without mats letting me know that I had no floor mats. They will be replacing them but it is on me and my own time to go back and I live in Rancho Cucamonga and pick them up so it cost me time money and gas.</Text>

<Text>The service representatives were very nice and helpful so 5 stars for service reps. I was told it would take a few days and then was told they were backed up and there's only one guy that can work on this particular job so it would take a few (more) weeks (1 stars for efficiency, I would have taken it somewhere that was able to do if quicker). They offered me a rental at least after a week (3 stars for offering the rental, but should have given me something right away if they knew they would be backed up weeks). Finally 1 star for not charging my car battery. It's a volt so I can drive on gas as well, but come on. If you're going to keep the car for weeks, the least you can do is charge the vehicle. Average is 3 stars for this visit.<//Text><Time>1611447973151< /Time><Gmap_id>0x80c2d90c044c0461:0x3c48a649be676d73< /Gmap_id>< userid>

Service did a good job repairing my car, replacing the defective air bag (recall) with my first appointment, and the control panel for the A/C and heater, and the rear door lock for my second appointment.  Plus they were great in arranging a Lyft ride for me so that I wouldn't have to hang around the dealership for a good part of the day.  The only thing I would recommend is that they call me as soon as my car is ready.  For both jobs, I called to check on my car's status because it was beyond the estimated timeframe.  Both times my car was ready, but they just had not called to let me know.</review>

< review>
As part of the Chevy complete care package, my tire rotation and vehicle inspection was complimentary for the first year after purchasing the car.  Both items were completed.  However, I would have liked to have known what items were being inspected since it is an EV.  I would have also liked to have been notified when the car was ready and as it waits, be plugged in to charge before I arrived. That would have been excellent customer service in my opinion.<//review>

We recently turned in our Chevrolet Bolt when our three-year lease ended (great EV, by the way). Andrew Lisk handled our transaction and we couldn't have been more pleased with the courtesy and respect that he showed us. Although we did not purchase another automobile (I just retired and no longer needed a third vehicle in the household), I recommend Andrew if you like to work with no pressure sales consultants.< /Text>

< Review>
I have been a salesman at a competitors dealership for 13 years. I know what really goes on at a dealership and I know very well how the service department (writers, techs, etc) operate.

The online appointment system failed completely. (As to be expected) but ....

When I arrived I was greeted promptly and helped out by Abe. He was gracious, did not complain about the fact that my online appointment wasn’t there, and very quickly and efficiently took my truck in and gave me realistic parameters on what to expect. He offered many different options in regards to getting me back home or back to the dealership when the vehicle was done.

Abe stayed in contact with me through out the day in a very professional unobtrusive way and was more than willing to break down all of the details of the service and its costs when I arrived for pick up.

The man was articulate, helpful, easygoing, focused, knowledgeable and quick.

Abe is obviously an asset to Sierra. Especially during the current economic times as they pertain to the auto industry.

YOU NEED PEOPLE LIKE ABE. GIVE THAT GUY AN EFFING SPOT BONUS OR SOMETHING!  No joke.</Review>

<rating>1</rating><text>I made appointment to bring vehicle in to fix an issue with the display. I was told that it would looked the same day and receive a call with an update which didn't happen. I called and was told that the car would have to kept another day with no promise that it would be looked at next day. If the service department is short handed then you shouldn't promise that the car would be taken care of in one day. I don't have another car that I can drive to work so I could leave the car at the dealership until it's repaired. I'm still having the same issue and it has to be resolved I will call GM and find out what can be done.< /text>< pics>

<Review>I had a great experience with Cristian as my sales manager and Steve as my finance manager. Both were excellent with providing me with the right information to make my decision to come back as a customer to purchase another lease with Sierra. Cristian was very good at getting me the vehicle I wanted and was very kind throughout the process. Steve was excellent at walking me through the numbers and details of the lease agreement.<//Review>< Name>

What a great team you guys have there at Sierra Chevrolet .. Alex was very helpful and knowledgeable about the trucks, a brief phone call with him is what brought me in to your dealership.  The whole process was no pressure and I would definitely recommend you guys to my friends.  Steve was awesome too, he walked me through the financing and warranties  with my truck.  I had a lot questions and he had all the answers.  I live in Toluca Lake.  There are quite a few Chevrolet Dealerships I had to pass by to get out to you guys, definitely  worth the trip!! Most of all, I love my new truck!! Thanks guys!!</review>

The team at Sierra Chevrolet was simply amazing.  The pricing is extremely competitive and the team we worked with went above and beyond to make my Dad's car buying experience great. Karen, Lorenzo (Sales Team)  and Steve (Finance) were so patient with answering all of the questions my Dad had. I highly recommend you visit them if you are in the market not only for a vehicle but for great service. I can't thank them enough. They have gained a lifetime customer.<//Text>

<text>Dropped off my car nearly 4 weeks ago for what I thought would be a quick visit. I brought in my check engine light codes, told them to give it a once over to see what needed to be done and signed the paperwork with a "Promised delivery" of 5pm that same day... Still don't have it back.

Timeline:
Monday January 25th, I drop off the car at my 8:30am appointment time, explain all I mentioned above, and they send me home in a lyft and tell me they'll call when they know more.

Since I hadn't heard anything after a few hours I called to get a status update around noon. They hadn't even started on my vehicle yet, and finally decided to tell me that the codes i brought in meant they needed to do a complete tear down of the engine.

I checked in daily to see if there were any updates, i was told on Friday the 29th that they thought it was my timing chain and they still needed to do a tear down.

Saturday the 30th, I was able to get a loaner through them, after needing to get a rental earlier in the week because they hadn't started on my car yet.

I followed up on Monday and was told that they had no information for me yet.

Tuesday, February 2nd I'm finally told that the tear down has begun. I check in a few times that week but don't get any information until the next Tuesday February 9th.

Feb 9th, i get a list of repairs and parts that will cost more than what the car is worth, at this point I'm already considering just abandoning it and buying a vehicle at another dealer just to get things over with.

A week and a half later brings us to today, February 18th where I'm still driving the loaner they got for me, which has been the only upside so far in their service, and still waiting to see how much more than the worth of my car I'm going to be charged when I'm frankly considering leaving it to be their problem if I don't get more information or even better, my car which right now feels like I'll be lucky to see before the end of the month, even though I've already been given two possible ETAs.

I understand that parts take time to ship and repairs can take a while, but the lack of communication up front has locked me into being in their shop's mercy for the last three and a half weeks, which if I had been told up front that I might be a month before I saw my car again, I would have gone somewhere else right from the start.

I've been told they might be able to swing some discounts or cut off some hours of labor, but at this point I don't know if I'll trust the totals I'm shown because it's been in their shop for so long and I have no way to contest or question whatever they decide to tell me they've done.

Now, if I get my car back and all is well I may come bump this rating up, but so far the two stars is only because my main point of contact has been patient with my nearly daily requests for information and the fact that I was given a loaner to use in the meantime.

I haven't decided yet, but I may never be using this shop or dealership again in the future. I try to give the benefit of the doubt and as much patience as I can manage, but this has honestly been ridiculous.

-A frustrated customer who just wants his car back and to not have to be homeless to pay for it.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2d90c044c0461:0x3c48a649be676d73< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Karen and Lorenzo provided me with amazing customer service and Steve in Finance really took the time to explain everything to me. They all made the process easy. From the very first phone call until everything was signed, I felt informed and confident that I chose the right dealership to give my business to. There are 4 Chevy dealerships much much closer to me, but there is no question that going to Sierra was worth the drive. Really want to thank you for all of your help and for making this a great experience. Also, great job ensuring your dealership is following Covid19 safety protocols. This is something that is also very important during these times.</Review><rate>5< /rate>< name>

<Text>I took my Tahoe in for a brake job.  I misread my service report from fall of 2018 and thinking that I had only 3mm of pad left on my vehicle.  I was contacted and told that I had 5mm of pad left and that I did not need a brake job at this time.  I greatly appreciate the honesty and integrity of the  technician and the service manager at Sierra Chevrolet.</Text>< pictures>

For the most part, the service experience was fine.  My problem, and why I did not provide a better rating, was I called after I dropped by car off and requested in addition to my oil change I wanted the tires rotated.  When I arrived to pick up my car the following day, I was assured the tires had been rotated.  They had not.  I do not appreciate being LIED to.  The instruction had not been added to the paperwork, which is why it probably did not get done, but I was so annoyed at the service person telling me it had been done I just left without getting the tires rotated.<//text>

Came in with one issue came out of there with 3 more, took a week longer than what they originally said they would. Didn't  even check 1 of the issues I told them my car had so now I have to find out what it is myself. Also, labor is way too overpriced. To change my battery they wanted to charge me almost 300 dollars when the battery was 170 dollars, So 130 to remove 4 bolts and swap the battery. ended up doing it myself and changed it in under 10 minutes. Communication was not it either. Will definitely start taking my car somewhere else.</review>

We took our Chevy traverse in for a repair as it was still under extended warranty. We were told they could not recreate the problem. We kept hearing a noise in the front end and eventually after about 6 times taking it back to them they finally heared  it. They claimed they fixed it and it did sound better for a month but now it has come back. I have been waiting for almost two months for them to get a loaner car for us and our extended warranty is about to run out. They claim since they do not have a diagnosis of the problem even though we left it with them for over two weeks without a loaner or rental car they can do nothing. I find it hard to believe what the service manager is telling me that no loaner cars have come in for almost two months. I guess we are going to try another dealership and just pay the copay again.<//Text>

DO NOT SHOP HERE!!! Was going to buy a vehicle here for what I thought was a reasonable price they had me go to my bank and get the loan only to sell the car from under me at the last moment after everything was already processed. If you want an example of a sleazy dealer look no further. Would have given zero stars if possible.< /review>

It was a great experience. I was hesitant to buy a chevy after visiting diamond chevrolet. However, after visiting your dealership and speaking with Jose and Steve. I'll definitely be coming back in the future.< /Review>

Bought a truck with a toneau cover but there was a recall on the mounting brackets. Was told the brackets would be ordered and my salesman said he would update me. a few weeks later I called to see what the hold up was...salesman again gave me an BS story and said the brackets were held up by Covid. Then a couple more weeks go by and I called the service dept who then told me the kit came in but was incomplete so they had to order the complete kit. 2 more weeks late I scheduled an appointment ot have to cover put on with the correct brackets...FINALL, but the service dept could not get the cover to fit. Keep in mind the cover was on the truck when I bought it. All this time I never received a single call from the sales person...all calls were initiated by myself or my wife.
As it turned out, I was heading to Texas for work and had to have a dealership in Texas finish the work...pathetic!</review>

I spent several months looking for the right truck and test drove countless Silverados visiting more than 10 dealerships. After speaking with Andrew from Sierra Chevrolet I decided to drive to Monrovia (50 miles away from my home) to see what they had to offer, I wasn't disappointed! I drove home with my new Trail Boss the next day and my experience with everyone from Sierra Chevrolet was OUTSTANDING, I would highly recommend shopping here and will be returning in the near future to purchase another vehicle.< /review>

Terrible sales manager by the name of Lorenzo.
We were dealing with a salesperson, Andrew, who was very friendly and helpful.

However, when this "sales manager" got involved everything became very shady. I've dealt with a lot of dealers and they wanted me to sit around for hours while they tried to get a car from another lot, but the one we were working on had already been sold to a customer somewhere else.

They continued with back and forth not finalizing any quotes and making me complete a finance application to get a "generic quote". When Lorenzo called me to try to get me to come in for our appointment I told him I didn't want to sit there for hours playing games with a car they didn't have. He told me that I was playing games and began to give me attitude.

Lorenzo, you belong in a used car dealer. This was the most unprofessional person I have EVER dealt with at any dealer. Sierra has unfortunately losty business thanks to this "manager".

In sales, you need to listen to your customer and hear what they tell you. Especially during coronavirus, it's not safe to drag my whole family into the dealer and expose them and possibly others.

Only reason I am giving them 2 stars: the original sales person was friendly and extremely helpful so was another manager also named Andrew we met.

But, too bad some dealers have terrible customer service at the point of sale.

FYI, I didn't need a finance application to get generic quotes from other dealers.</text>

Car dealerships make a commission if they can get you to finance in house. Most often, these are the worst companies to finance through and if they can, they will hike up the rates to make more money off of you rather than save you money.

Don’t trust a place that isn’t willing to put there customers above a quick payday for themselves. These people will place their wallets before your ability to secure a place to sleep at night. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I recently bought a Bolt with the help of salespeople Karen and Jose, and the experience was smooth and excellent. They were upfront about pricing, and Karen stayed past her shift to work around our schedule. Unlike other dealerships, the people here know about EVs. When going through the piles of paperwork, Steve from financing walked us through and explained everything simply and succinctly. He offered to let us use their fast charging station whenever we passed through. This was our first ever Chevy purchase, and the customer service here would entice us to go with them again.<//review>< pics>

I paid $800 to do a 75,000 miles car service, the agent told me my battery is leaking when I pick up my car. He said I need to paid extra to replace the battery, I told him that's impossible because I just changed the battery with AAA insurance roadside service 3 days ago. But the agent insisted that the battery is leaking, he didn't tell me where and how the battery leaking. He neglected me after I told him I refuse to paid for the battery. After I went home I called AAA, they sent the roadside service technician to me and check the battery carefully, you know what? The battery is totally perfect. The Chevrolet service believe my battery is leaking because the connector has some acid from the old one. They ask me to buy a new battery without checking it with voltage detection machine, or even cleaning the connector! What the FXXX, I mean, I paid $800 for the service and you give me this? Really?< /review>

I came at exact 1030am to get the recall done, and then the guy told me it's only going to take an 1hr and 30min. I got a call around 1630 telling me that they didn't do anything yet to my car and they are gonna need more time, they are asking me to pick up the car the next day!
I was talking to one of the costumers that was there to pick up their vehicle and I asked him what time he came for his oil change and he said around 1200-1300 and he got his car done first.
It's all about money they will put you their least priority since they are not making money out of a RECALL.</review>< pics>

<Text>I bought a new vehicle @ Sierra Chevrolet & the experience was GREAT!  Andrew Lisk (Sales Representative) was prompt/punctual & meeting me @ the scheduled appointment time w/ the vehicle i wanted.  After a test drive, once the terms of purchase were agreed to, Andrew gave me a ride to my bank to pick up the check.  Andrew went thru every detail of my new vehicle w/ me & was very professional & courteous.  Andrew also went the extra mile & provided me a lot of additional points for my new "myChevrolet," account (THANK YOU)!  The Sales Manager was very professional & straight to the point during the final price negotiations.  Steve Del Campo (Finance Manager) was very professional, courteous, humorous & was transparent in explaining everything!  Overall, the entire purchase experience was GREAT!  Thank You Sierra Chevrolet Sales Team!  Your Customer Service ROCKS!</Text>< pictures>

Just stop by to look at those blazer, I provided the lady with all my info and what I am looking as far as down payment, mileage and to email me with quote. But, so far no responses. I guess they want you sit there for couple hours in order to provide you with sales pitch. Which she started right before I leave.</text>

<Review>Transparency! Wow, I've owned and leased quite a few cars, and this was the first dealership that within a few emails, I felt FULLY confident that it was the right decision! Upon asking about a lease offer I saw on the Sierra website, Corey - Sales Manager - emailed me all the details - including fees, residual value, money factor - all the information I needed to feel assured I understood the lease terms. I've never had such wonderful transparency - ever.

I headed to the dealership and realized I needed more time to decide. My sales person, Cristian Zuno, was patient and understanding. I realized that I wanted a particular interior option, and let the dealership know. They found the exact car I wanted, and I picked it up that next weekend. I sat with Corey, all paperwork was ready. I then sat with Steve in finance and he was incredibly thorough - like I've never seen before. The whole process was so smooth and fast - I was in and out in under 30 minutes with my Bolt Premier!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

He was really knowledgeable and extremely courteous to what I needed. He went about my car situation very professionally. It brought great relief to know that my car was in the hands of people who really knew what they were doing.
He not only moved my car up the line to get it checked first but he also helped me with the shuttle bus. Abe communicated with me throughout the day on the status of my car. I greatly appreciated his intentionality.
I will definitely be back in the future for any car repairs!</Review>< pics>

I had to drive on a flat tire to the dealership Sunday night to get the tire replaced. The car was ready for me to pick up Thursday afternoon. It was delivered to me covered in dust and with a new dent on it. Want more? Here is the longer version:
I was quoted a tire price almost 100 dollars more than the competition (over the phone). You dealership matches prices, but I had to walk in to present a printed offer (available on the website) from the competition, to get that price. A big waste of time for me. At that time, I was told the tire was not in stock but the car will be ready tomorrow. I was already sorry, since the competition did have the tire. But hey... OK.
The next day I did not get any calls to update me. I called 3 times and no one else but the person that helped me first could tell me what is going on. And that person was never available.
Next day (Wednesday) I found the same story. I had to call to get an update. I find out the tire is in and the car will be ready sometime later. The original ticket also had my claim that the car did not drive straight new, so I wanted the alignment check under warranty. I called a second time and I am told the car is ready (why didn't I get a call to be told it's done?), so I asked if the alignment was done..... No, we forgot. After checking with the technicians, I am told the alignment machine is under repair and the alignment will be done tomorrow, or I can give up and just get my car as it is. I decided to wait another day.
Thursday, I get no call with an update. I have to call to find out. And every single time I have to specify who helped me first and there is shuffling and searching for that person. The response is that no alignment in needed. So I asked then why is the car not driving straight? The response: I don't know. I am telling you what I know. I can go ask, but take time, or you can just pick the car up. By this time I've been without a car for many days and I had to deal with unhelpful reps. I decide to pick up my car. I have points I will pay partially with.
I arrive and have to wait. The car will pulled for me. I attempt to pay with points. The manager says she doesn't know how to deal with points. Asks another rep: Do you? Nope, that one doesn't know either. Only the third rep knows. "He is our points guy".
As I said in the beginning, the car was covered in dust and had a dent in the rear fender. The manager wrote by hand on my service sheet that the dent will be fixed sometime. I have to wait on a another person to come to work. This person is the only one who knows the schedule for the "dent guy". So when he is going to be in, I'm going to get a call to bring my car in to get it fixed.
Would you ever step into this dealership? There are serious training issues that seem to be systemic. It's not just one bad employee.<//text>

<Text>Honestly, I only ever write good reviews and try to just stay away from places that disappoint. But this place was awful. I’ve only ever had great experiences at Chevy dealerships, so this place was extra frustrating. Our “appointment” for an oil change took over 5 hours. We were originally quoted 2.5 - 3 hours when dropping the car off (which is still crazy for an appointment), but this small, routine maintenance ended up consuming more than half of our day. Not to mention, we were placed on hold for 15 minutes+ at a time when calling to simply check on our car. The only positive to any of this was the nice customer service guy that kept transferring our calls and finally had to personally check on the car himself. “Said guy” is too good for this place.  Long story long, stay away from Sierra Chevrolet. I know I will.</Text></record>

Ten days (!!) later they told me that I needed a new engine ($8,000).  I did not believe them and had my car towed (again! Thank you, AAA) to All-Car Specialists in Alhambra. The All-Car people explained that I needed a new clutch, not a new engine, and showed me why. I ended up paying less than half the quote from Sierra Chevrolet and my car drives like new.  The Sierra Chevrolet would probably have charged me thousands more, since they would have had to replace the clutch anyway.  I will never go back to Sierra Chevrolet; their sales people are OK, but their mechanics are incompetent. I will never go back to them. Ever.< /Review>< resp>

Service department is a complete joke.  Was told by a rep that my car keys would be left with the sales department, this wasn't done and now my car is unavailable for three days.  This was separately confirmed by TWO employees, and the only reason I brought my car in in the first place was because I received multiple calls within the span of a week to bring my car in for a voluntary recall.</Review>

<text>I bought my 2015 Chevy 4 by 4 quad cab at Dublin Chevrolet for $45,000. When my paint started peeling a year later I got concerned. I took the truck to Dublin to have them paint it and it was returned to me with three panels on it still peeling. The manager assured me that they would bring me back and have me have the truck repainted again for a second time. After returning home I was informed by GM that I would have to make arrangements with Jesse the Suns owner of Dublin Chevrolet in order to get my car painted correctly. Since they had paid Jesse $5,500 to paint my vehicle and its entirety they wanted to know why the vehicle was returned to me with areas of the truck not painted that were peeling. I had no answer for them I referred them to Dublin Chevrolet and asked if there was something criminal going on at that dealership. They then explain to me that the dealership is its own franchise and can do as it wishes with this customers. I informed them since they had paid Chevy to paint my vehicle how was I to make sure that Dublin Chevy actually performed the work. Long story short I was told by GM 5 minutes ago that Dublin Chevy will no longer be dealing with my vehicle and GM will not authorize my painting to be done at any other dealership therefore I have a 2 year old vehicle that has ¾ of the body with damage and my 3-year 36000 mile warranty expired the moment I drove away from Dublin Chevy. How convenient I do however remember them trying to sell me an extra extended warranty for my paint and this is where it becomes interesting. The extended warranty on the pain and corrosion would have covered me for an extra four years had I had bought it but in the circumstance that my paint started peeling I would still have to argue with the dealership that I bought the warranty from on whether or not the areas were in fact peeling. In my research I have found that the dealership that I have been working with is in fact been paid to have my vehicle painted and restored completely however they did not pay the auto body shop to do the work and my truck was not completely painted and returned to its original state. I now have a two year old truck that is worthless but understanding why a corporation sells a warranty on its product is priceless.< /text><GmapID>0x80c2d90c044c0461:0x3c48a649be676d73<//GmapID></record>

I couldn't be more impressed with the level of service I received from Sierra.

After going to a few other dealerships in the area, I was referred over to Sierra Chevrolet.

From the moment I walked-in I was treated with respect, and could tell that your team was genuinely interested in earning my business.

I initially worked with Gus, Rashad, and Edward, who took me on a couple of test drives and explained the features of the cars I was interested in.  They were very knowledgeable, and took their time to ensure I understood everything.

Then I worked with Rudy to go over purchase options on the car I selected.  Rudy took his time and explained my options, including the rebates for electric vehicles.  Even though the dealership was very busy, I did not feel rushed, and everyone took their time with me.

I was very impressed that Rudy and his team were not pushing me into getting the car.  In-fact, Rudy told me that if I was able to wait one day, he would be able to get me a better deal since he could speak to another department the next day.  Even though he could have "closed the deal" on the spot, he did what was best for me as the customer, and took additional steps to get me a more favorable deal.  Very impressed!

Rudy came through with his promise, and called me early the next day to tell me everything was approved.  He then set an appointment for me to come-by that day to meet with his partner, Corey, so that I could be in and out as soon as possible.

The process from there was seamless.  The car was cleaned, washed, and charged; ready to roll.  Corey was super friendly and helpful, and explained additional features on the car.  I sat down with Steve in the finance department, and he explained all of the finance details, and gave me lots of helpful additional information on my new electric car.  Steve continued the trend of not being pushy, and taking his time to ensure I understood everything I was signing.

The most impressive part came at the end of the purchase.  My wife needed to sign a form for our trade-in, but she was unable to make it down to the dealership for a few days.  Corey and Rudy arranged for Gus to drive to my house (more than 15 miles away) in rush hour, so that my wife could sign the form there.  Gus showed-up on-time, explained everything to my wife about what she was signing, asked us if we had any other questions, and was friendly throughout the entire process.  UNBELIEVABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!

Anyways, super impressed across the board.  Thanks for helping me out.

Keep up the good work!</Text>

If you value your time stay clear of this place.  I was misled multiple times.   First I was told that I would get an estimate within 4 hrs.  That was a lie.  Then  I was told I would get updates via text. That was also a lie.  Then I had to go back to the dealership to get an update and I was told my car was being diagnosed. That was a lie.  I was then told that they were diagnosing the car and that I would be updated before 6 pm on the status. Sadly that was also a lie.   The next day I was not given an update and I had to call to find out the status.  I was told that they had not determined anything and that they don't do diagnoses on Saturday ( I was lied to that they would work on the car on Saturday).   Yet another lie.   Finally I told them to get my car ready so I could pick it up since I need it to go to work and I have no faith in the dealership and it would be foolish for me to believe the promises of an organization that lied to my face multiple times and caused me to waste two days of my time.    This is doubly disapointing since I leased my car from this dealership and had a great experience,  I was not expecting this terrible treatment.   Hopefully they will fix this but I will take my chances with any other dealership rather than go back to face this nightmare.</review>

I wish that I could leave 0 stars. This dealership is awful. I had the worst customer service from Roger Flores. I was lied to by him and the finance person that was working at the time. Both were rude to me and ran my credit so many times when they said they were going to run it once. I called back to speak with  Roger Flores about the matter and he hung up on me and said he wasn’t going to deal with me. I called back and asked to speak with the GM and was sent to the voicemail. This dealership is beyond unprofessional. If you want to waste your time, money and get treated horribly, then by all means, go to this place. There are way better dealers I t he area and this place DOES NOT DESERVE your time or hard earned money. Being lied to and treated badly is the last thing that should happen when you’re spending money on a new car.</text>

Everyone was so patient and polite. We bought my car here and they really broke down the contract for us so we could understand everything. We loved the experience so much that we can back here 6 months later to buy my husband's car. They gave us great trade in values, great deals, and an overall great experience.< /text>

<name>David Garcia<//name><Date>1565681449465< /Date><rating>1<//rating><text>I was brought into the Chevrolet Service Managers office. To speak to the manager to find out why they were unable, to diagnose the problem; with my brakes wearing out three times faster in the rear than the front. I was told I was going to be speaking to the Chevrolet Service Manager, I spoke with Candis. I believe that's her name. I also believe that Candis works for the Subaru dealer. I was not told this. I had to find out on my own. I did some research when I got home. She had no idea why there was a problem and said everything was working fine. While I was talking to her, a man just walked in and sat down. He never stated who he was, never! The more I questioned if it could be; the Brake booster, ABS, portioning valve, calipers, lines, ect... He just jumped in and took over and basically kicked Candis out of the chair, and took over the conversation. He was very rude to her and me. He stated "if the car stops, the brakes work!" I also asked why they were unable to find out why the brakes are wearing this way he stated "they cannot diagnose them if I don't purchase the brakes and rotors first." I  continued to ask questions and he got more sarcastic and rude. I was told by both of them "they don't have the technology to diagnose the problem and some cars just have inherent problems." According to Abe the person who was the service advisor who I was talking to, "it must be a ghost in the system." I asked if they could at least fix the motor mount that I've been complaining about for years. He said NO.  I found out later he was the service manager for Chevrolet and his name is Keith Burney. I told him the whole point of the diagnosis was so I can let Chevrolet Corporate know, and he didn't care!

I personally feel I have been getting the runaround, if the issues were not warranty related I feel I would have been better taken care of than if I was paying cash for the work.< /text>< pics>

My appointment for service at Sierra Chevrolet was a perfect example to businesses on how to keep their customers happy and returning. Jeffrey Marshall handled my car that day and couldn't have been more courteous, polite, friendly and efficient. Not to forget the 5-star servicing of my car
Our lives' busy days should contain a positive experience like this at every turn and connection.
Sincerely,
Dorothy L Miller, Pasadena resident (satisfied)< /review>

Car was not ready to take home on day of purchase.  I called and let the dealer know that I was coming in with a check to pay in full.  Only 24 miles left on the Bolt EV.  I was asked to wait an hour to let it charge.  Sales rep. told me that it would charge to 80% in the hour.  It still wasn't ready, (Only 91 out of 230 miles charge on it)  so I had to come back for it the next day. (I never really dealt with Douglas, the one I was speaking with on the phone regarding purchasing the Bolt as he was busy.)  This left me very weary of the sales office.  They did apologize after I complained about needing to return but wish it was a better buying experience.</review>

This dealership is head and shoulders above the rest. My sales manager was Sergio Sandoval. My finance manager was Steve Del Campo. Both provided the professionalism and excellence one should expect of a top-tier dealership.  All my questions were answered. Hell, even the questions I did not ask were answered. I walked out with one-half of the American Dream, and a big smile on my face.

Sierra Chevy - be proud of your dynamic duo!<//Review>

Had to bring my Chevy Volt in because the hatch wasn't staying up and I had to balance it on the back of my neck to keep it up. This was a recall item that supposedly address last year here but, the struts weren't keeping the hatch up anymore. Fortunately, I brought it in before the warranty on the fix expired and they replaced the struts and did a quick check of the oil and brakes in under 20 minutes at no charge. I really appreciated that.</review>

And the other employees were very friendly and helpful, too.  I got a very good deal on my Chevy Cruze that I am leasing.  I have already told friends and they are interested in going there as well now.

Check engine light recently came on, took it in, they kept it for a day, I get a phone call that the car is done and ready. After picking up the car, check engine light comes back on 30 mins later. Take it back this time the vehicle is there for 3 days, again they tell me the problem is fixed. I pick the car up, the following day, check engine light comes back on. I call the dealership, they tell me that the mechanic did check it and it was good. I asked for the list of codes that made the check engine light on, then I was told he didnt print them out. So in other words all the mechanic did was clear the check engine light and not check my car.
I talk to the Service advisor and tell him I need the car fixed, put a different Mechanic on it. someone who will FIX the problem.
Now, I have to take the Vehicle back, one week later they magically have all the codes that may be causing the check engine to come on. Something in the tune of $3500.00 for oil leaks. The car sits there for a month, without anywork being done to it, I never even received a phone call from the service advisor ( Abe). The excuse I got was that the mechanic was overwhelmed with work and there was no engine bay available.
A month a half later, picked up the Car, on my way home the car is smoking and leaking oil, there is oil splattered on the top end of the engine. I wanted to check the oil and noticed that the dipstick was broken.
Take the Car back to the dealership, one week later the car is ready. I pick it up drive it home, only to notice now, it is not only smoking but it massively leaking oil, when I called to speak to the Service manager, she was rude and condescending. Wow, Really? You have had my vehicle for over 2 months, charged me 3500.00 and provided the worst service I have ever received, from the Service advisor, the mechanic and  the Service Manager.
Talked to the General Manager, Mike Hoffman, who is a poor excuse of a manager, he offered NO APOLOGIES for this debacle, the terrible service or terrible repairs or lack thereof that was done on my vehicle. Very pompous and matter of fact, his answer was the vehicle is now repaired so he didnt see what the problem was, or why I would be requesting my money back on the labor charges, excuse me, if you as a general manager are satified with this misrepresentation of Chevrolet and Chevrolet service, I can assure you that this WILL BE THE VERY LAST CHEVROLET I purchase in my life and furthermore this is a great explanation of why the SERVICE is so POOR</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Initially, I had told Doug S. the salesrep that I was not interested, thinking they did not have the car I wanted, but he said he would work with me as he wanted my business. Indeed, he was very responsive, polite, answered all my questions and demonstrated that he was ready and willing to work with me.

On the day of purchase, Doug was off work, and Gustavo J. bravely stepped in and handled the not-so-fun negotiation over several hours; and came through for me to get the price I wanted.  He also drove for over two hours to bring the contract and car down to me over 100 miles away!  In addition, he stayed and answered all my questions, showed me features of the car, and did a little test drive with me, before going back home.  He really went out of his way to work with me!

Keep in mind that I had never stepped foot inside the dealership, and everything was done via email, phone and text.

I have been very pleased at the individual and team effort at Sierra Chevrolet. Thank you!<//Review>

Sierra Chevrolet was AMAZING to us in ordering our 2018 2500 HD (10 stars). Mike Hoffman not only went the extra mile helping us but went over and beyond having the truck shipped to us in Oregon. This is our fourth vehicle we have bought from Sierra and will never buy from anyone else as long as Mike Hoffman is around.
Thank you Mike and to all involved in making this deal happen.</review>

<Text>I am very disappointed with this place. I have taken my truck two times there To get it inspected and they never have time..i wasted my time and money on uber since its my only car, just for them to come up with the same excuse that they dont have time to check my car and that they have to keep it longer...i mean  how hard is it to just take a quick look and see what the problem is?...idk about the mechanics but people on the office is just horrible..< /Text>< Pictures>

I purchased my Chevrolet Tahoe at Sierra Chevrolet and continue to service it here because they keep it running great.  I have not ever been stuck on the side of the road or had to pull off the freeway because of car trouble since November 2005 when I bought my car.  They email to remind me of services required and let me know what I can get by without.

Keep up the good work Jeff!!!!!!

<Review>Was in there today to shop around for prices and a truck... they try to sell me a truck that did it they didn't have in the lot and wanted me to make a deal over a vehicle that I have not seen and offered me $1,000 for my trade in which is worth more money... since I didn't accept your deal they literally threw me out will never ever consider coming to the dealership again</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Will not recommend going to Sierra Chevrolet in Duarte.

Valerie Nottingham was our sales person.  She withheld material information from us and was deliberate of misinforming us.  We had agreed on an out-the-door price, but when we went to the finance office to sign the paper, it was nearly $3,000 more than what we had agree on.  Valerie and her team charged us for accessories that were included in the premium package and included services/warranties without telling us.  We were rushed to drive the car out of the lot  The car had missing accessories which we still don't have 19 days after purchasing our car, and it had scratches on the front bumper.  Valerie said the scratches came from the night cleaning crew.  She literally said the cleaning crew is not very careful about the new cars on the lot.  They were many things that Valerie Nottingham and her team said and/or did that lead us to believe they are dishonest and unethical.

Customers are not their priority.  The care nothing but meeting their sales quota and $.<//Text>< Pics>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I went to the dealer to just look around and test drive a couple of the cars. I did not plan on buying a car that day. But I saw a car that I really liked(Sonic RS), at an unbeatable price. Oscar, the salesperson who assisted me during the car buying process, was sweet and attentive. He answered all of our questions patiently and helped us to get a good deal on financing. I will recommend this dealer to other people. Chevy have won me over as a fan.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Sierra Chevrolet has the WORST COMMUNICATION EVER!! They don’t return phone calls or emails, Rudy the Manager I’m still waiting!! Read Sierra Chevrolet’s Mission Statement that is a total LIE!! Family, pristine used other vehicles, and they thoroughly inspect used vehicles is a LIE!!! We were repeat customers and I guarantee  we won’t ever go back to buy anything! Ron Brown, who is he? He doesn’t care either!! I left voicemails and emails with NO RESPONSE!! THANKS FOR NOTHING!! I don’t have time to write a book for you but we filled out the pink repair paper before we left the lot and it says they will repair to our satisfaction. They didn’t and nobody over there cares!! I wouldn’t buy anything from Sierra Chevrolet!! Go to Glendora or Covina to get a vehicle!!<//review>

I will NEVER come to this place again. This place is run terribly. You fooled me twice, but you will NEVER lie to me again.

Don't tell your customers their car will be ready when it won't be. It makes them wonder what else you arrogantly lie to them about.<//text>

<text>No one ever contacted me about my parts coming in for my vehicle this was the second time  that I had to contact  the service department to see if my parts had come in.  You really need to communicate better within your business. Customers shouldn't have to do the legwork for you .  Just wrong.  Weeks went by  without any word from the dealer.</text></record>

This is a place to never come back ... They sold me a $40k vehicle with a defect in the transmission i went back and spoke to the sales manager and they only offered to help with $140 for an inspection and they sent me to a different dealer because they cannot help me after they sold me the vehicle with a defect. They told me i was on my own after the inspection .I wish i can give them a zero on the review .</text>

Left at 9 in morning for oil change and battery. I had to repeatedly call for info. Took all day. Still not done when promised. Needed to be at event . Told them that in morning. "No Problem" vehicle wasn't ready until 6pm. Then they could not find it.  Will not be back and you should not either.</Review><date>1521866899665<//date>< gmapID>

They take way too long to do an oil change.  I was originally quoted 30-40 minutes on the phone by the person who set up my appointment.  I had an 8am, one of the first appointments so I was assured a quick completion time.  When I arrived, nobody was able to check me in until 810am. Didn't receive my car until 9:30am, so it took nearly 1.5 hours. Additionally, the customer who checked in after me had their car serviced before mine.  I don't know what's going on with their service department but I will never use them again.<//Text>

<review>I bought a Silverado on the East Coast last November, and have been having it serviced at Sierra Chevrolet since I moved here in January.  There have been several recalls and I have to say, the folks at Sierra Chevrolet have always made it really easy to take care of those recalls.   Last time they also gave me a rental car and cleaned and valeted my truck so that it was gorgeous when they gave it back to me.  I couldn't recommend them more highly.< /review>< user_id>

<Date>1557878488954</Date><rate>1<//rate><Text>Horrible customer service, shady sales tactics, and overall unpleasant service associates.  I purchased my 2017 Chevy Volt from these individuals and have had nothing but issues with it.  When I called to have my latest transmision related issue looked into, I was told it would be covered under the car's powertrain warranty, but when I got to the dealership they told me that it would not be covered and whoever told me over the phone that it would be was a liar.  It speaks volumes when the employees of this company are willing to call each other liars and take no responsibility for their colleagues promises.

My other service experiences with them are similar.  The first time that I went out to them, they had my car in service for 8 days with a faulty brake sensor.  In side of my car I have a dash camera, and they didn't unplug it during the service and I found that the car was simply sitting in the lot for 7 of those days, all while they told me via status updates that the car was being "worked on" as they determined the vehicles' issue.

Long story short stay far far away from this dealership.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>Only one star because you HAVE to give a star.
I hear this is a great place to buy a new car or truck, which I will never do. The service department will keep me from ever buying a vehicle here and or even bringing my truck back here to service. I have never met a more condescending, no it all,  rude "service manager" in my life. I'm not sure SHE knows she's in customer service department.
I hope this review makes you think twice before taking your vehicle here, even for warrenty work.</review>< date>

< Review>
Shame on you, Sierra Chevrolet in Monrovia, for taking advantage of an 84-year-old stroke victim with severe dementia. Our neighbor somehow managed to drive from Palm Springs and randomly found this dealership. He arrived in an uninsured car with expired plates, and the dealership “helped” him purchase a new car as he had a bag full of cash. Not only did they sell him a car, they upsold him options, and to top it off “sold” him a 2-week insurance policy so that he could drive the car off the lot. After the purchase our neighbor became confused, abandoned the car about 400 yards from the dealership, and ended up in a local hospital as he was disoriented. Once his friends became aware of the situation and tried to return the car to Sierra Chevrolet, they would not return his money, and offered to “buy back” the car at 40% of the retail price he had paid two days earlier! Even a complete stranger can clearly see that our neighbor is not lucid and does not have the cognitive ability to understand a purchase contract. Unethical, unprofessional, and unconscionable.< /Review>

If I could give this place negative stars I would! This is the worst dealer I have ever in my life had to deal with. Thanks to this dealer Chevy has lost us as customers forever! And we already own 3 other Chevy trucks! I am specifically referring to the service department and specifically to Rich who was terrible! Why work in customer service if you dont want to deal with people?! He had a negative attitude towards us from the moment we walked in and we felt like he was lying straight to our face! The service department will tell you what ever you want to hear but will not provide any actual service. Every time we went to a scheduled appointment we were encountered by surprised faces of the employees as they didnt see our appointment (they dont even look in the system so how could they see them?!) They tell you to leave your car there for an unknown amount of time and when they have the time they will look at your car. To top it all of they dont even provide you with a loaner car. So not only are you left car-less you also have no idea for how long! Everytime we have been there the person who took care of us the last time "no longer works there." Bottom line they just dont care about their customers!</Text>

This dealer has something akin to a superiority complex. I recently brought my car in to have the airbag system diagnosed. I had just been rear ended and the car's airbag light had come on with the message "Service Airbag." After talking to some mechanics and doing some of my own research online, I came to the conclusion that, at a minimum, the system had to be reset. It could have sustained more damage as well, as the seat belts had locked up, but for sure I was not going to escape the $100+ it would cost to reset the system. OK. I accepted that. So I brought it in and the parts representative confirmed that resetting the system would cost me at least $100+. My dad and I dropped off the car and the next day we came back inquiring on the vehicle. We were given a statement of work in excess of $4000 with the explanation that everything comprising the airbag system, with the exception of the airbag itself, since it did not deploy, would have to be replaced. This included the computer modules, the sensors, the seat belts, and all this other stuff. I then told the manager at the dealer that when the appraiser for the at fault party appraised the damage, he could only appraise what he could see from the outside. Since all of this was internal, this was not part of his appraisal. The appraiser's explicit instructions were to have whomever inspected the vehicle (that being the dealer here) contact the appraiser directly to discuss additional issues. The manager was absolutely adamant on NOT talking to the appraiser. "We do not deal with insurance," he said. "That is YOUR responsibility. YOU work it out with them." So let me get this straight. Most likely, the dealer is overcharging me with this statement of work because prior to showing up at the dealer, I had gotten some estimates that were significantly lower from some body shops regarding the airbag system. Yet I am giving the dealer a chance to make some money, but oh, he cannot be bothered with spending any of his precious time or energy dealing with the nitty gritty of contacting the insurance company who will actually be paying for this on my behalf. Could this be because he very well knows that he is overcharging significantly and that insurance will not agree to these exorbitant charges and so he figures that the best thing to do would be to go directly to me because I am an easy target for gouging? And then, of course, not only does he have to gouge me, he has to insult my dignity and my intelligence by instructing and educating me in a rather patronizing way that it is not the dealer's responsibility to deal with insurance bureaucracy but rather, the onus falls on the victim, who has already been traumatized enough with being in an accident. So I think I am beginning to construct in my mind what the mantra of this dealer is regarding its customers. 1. BS the customer, 2. Gouge the customer, 3. Insult the customer, and 4. Drive away the customer. OK. Point made. Since the dealer does not want my business, the dealer won't get it. Now or ever.<//text>

<Time>1541130063406</Time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Not helpful and no communication still to this date. I brought my car in for a transmission issue twice with no resolution. On both occasions I was told that they cannot replicate the issue. The second time I was asked to leave the car as the technician has called in sick. I was called the next day and the serviceman said they did find that the spark plugs needed to be replaced and I said ok. He said they had not yet looked into the transmission as his tech was out sick again. I asked for a loaner vehicle as this was taking to long just for a diagnosis. They approved me for the loaner vehicle which I had for a week. I had not heard for the serviceman so i decided to call just out of curiosity  and thats when I was told that my car has been ready.  Really? When I got there they said still no issues found on the transmission so then I asked to take the technician on a road test and they said he could not cause he called in sick once again. After getting my car back I looked at the mileage and saw 1 mile was put on my odometer. WOW! I asked them to road test it on thy he highway as that's where I had most trouble with the car. He said they would not as it was unsafe for the technician. Ok but I have to drive it daily on the highway. Lord save me! The paper work also said tires inflated to proper specs and looked at the info center in my car and that was a huge lie. Its just where it was when I left it. Makes me think if they truly tested my car?  So I called my warranty carrier and they said to take it to another dealership and I did. I informed them that this was approaching the 3rd service issue and this could be a lemon law requirement. The warranty carrier agreed. When  I took my car into the other dealer I told them that I'm so inconvenienced that I was ready to file for the lemon law and the new serviceman agreed as well but to at least let them try first, so I did. They were available to road test the car with me and saw the same transmission issue I did. They said it was a software update that I needed and performed it free of charge. They told me it would take a week or so to complete the software update and to come back if there is no changes. Sierra Chevrolet really cares about you enough to make the sale but after that your just a pain in their sides when it comes to service.</text>< pics>

I went twice to Sierra Chevrolet. First time @ service with Brian was great and helpful with follow ups, Called me back as soon possible. The second time was a cat and mouse chase. Every single time I called him, never answered. He would say he would called me back but never did. I called to speak to Service manager, The person that answers the phone said he
was out for a family emergency. Which this was the second day of me calling. Shouldnt they leave someone else in charge???</Text>

Sierra made the process painless, very transparent, very open, forthcoming and no pressure. When I got home I had no regrets and didn't feel like I needed a shower from the dirty back and forth that a lot of dealer make you go thru.
I would highly recommend this dealership if your looking to buy a new chevrolet.<//review>< date>

They lied about being able to sell me engine cleaner even thought they had it  just so I have to bring my car in and pay them to do it for me. I called every other GM dealership and they said they would sell me the cleaner. When I called back to talk to the sales department about it they hung up on me.< /Text>

<Time>1482847728630< /Time><Text>The worst! Go in for warranty work. Multiple problems, multiple times, and all you get from the dealership and GM is oh can't find the issue. Can't duplicate.  Weird because anyone riding in the vehicle asks what's wrong maybe there is an issue.   Guess when purchase a car there is no warranty!! One of the worst experiences ever any time you go!  Then you schedule an appointment to go with a technician and arrived to "he's off". And "Only he can go with you. Come in maybe on Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve since you work". Really?  No customer service in service only let me sit here and do nothing for you!  Try getting off your butt and doing your job!!!!!!!!< /Text>< rate>

Super slow service, schedule oil change taking 4 hours. I couldn't wait any longer and I had to take my car back. Made another apointment to Glendora Chevy where I bought my car. On the phone told me 45 minutes to do oil change and I was 2 1/2 hour late for work. This dealer is closer to my house, but drive 35-45 minutes to Glendora Chevy. Make sure financing and price locked on the exact model before go to Glendora Chevy dealer otherwise you'll over pay. I was able to save $2000 on same car from Glendora Chevy instead of buying form here. Try Capital One Auto Financing, It's convenient and easy to shop online and will save you money. Skip this dealership and save your precious time & money.<//review>

I purchased a brand new Chevy Tahoe here and that experience was fine, about average. The service center here however is astoundingly rude. There's one older gentleman who seems to be kind and caring about his customers, however, I never had the opportunity to interact personally with him. Every phone conversation, and interaction with the other staff felt as though I were inconveniencing the people working there. Plus I was quoted a time for one hour to an hour and a half so I scheduled to wait for an hour and a half it ended up taking over 3 hours. And I missed appointments I have scheduled afterwards. They wouldn't even let me get my car back so that I could leave and come back later to have the light bulbs replaced.<//Review>

I have taken my truck back 3 times at this point(Chevy Silverado 1500-2012). This was for a simple noise. Then after your mechanics made me spend over 4000 dollars, it made a worst noise, wouldn't start one morning and seemed to be doing more damage than good to my engine.

Every time I've had to call your office for an update or the check on my vehicle. Even when my truck was ready the 2nd time I was the one to check if it was ready. If I wouldn't have called I wouldn't have got my vehicle that day.

You've had my truck at your shop again and its still there. This is all from the original noise, 3 weeks ago. I called several times to speak to Ray the guy in charge apparently, the guy who said he'd be the one taking care of it, and he's stepped out every time I've called. For being a loyal customer, 4 chevy trucks to be exact, from your dealership I find this completely unacceptable. I use two larger capacity vehicles for my business and I've had two for leisure from you guys.

Never ever recommending, buying or even mentioning you guys to anyone. It mystifies me how you are still in business.

Oh and my truck is still in your shop, Ray has probably stepped out again and I will get nowhere with this. Thanks</review>

Worst experience of my life!! If there was an option for Negative Stars Id give them a -5. Dont expect truthful information about any used vehicle they sell. They are strictly concerned about turnover. Misinformation is more in line with what I experienced. I purchased a vehicle from them in September of 2016 and have had nothing but problems with the car. I was told that they performed a detailed inspection and the car was found to be in perfect working order with only a few minor cosmetic damage to the body. So far Ive had to replace the entire cooling system, starter and now the trans is likely to be out. Serra Chevy is in my opinion the most dishonest dealership Ive ever come in contact with. Its shameful that businesses like this are able to operate. Im posting a complaint on the BBB as well in hopes that no one else has the same experience as I.< /text>

It took them 2.5 hours just to do an oil change and they did not even wash my car.A shuttle never came by and when he did it was an hour and a half later which I was told my car was almost ready. I was told I had a recall so I did an appointment for the next day. When I get there they tell me the recall is still not in effect.</Review>

<Review>We leased a Chev Volt here for 36 months. The vehicle itself is well-built American-made car.  Its service department, however, let us down each of the four times when we brought the car in for recall purpose. The check-in process is NEVER simple - the waiting area is small and shallow and the service reps hardly give genuine greetings or spared some smiles for customers. Each time I stayed in line for 5-10 minutes before being served and watched the reps slowly key-in the information - all in slow motion. That's enough to set anyone off the wrong foot first thing in the morning.  Want some comparisons?  Go to next door Advantage Ford and see how efficient and pleasant their service department is!!!

We just returned the lease vehicle a few days ago and certainly are happy that we no longer have to deal with the service department at Sierra. If we have another Chevy in the future, I will seek service from other dealership for sure.<//Review>< user_id>

"Top-notch service" isn't how I would describe this dealership. From the unprofessional phone call to set up the appointment to terrible communication and an attitude from the rep Maria, we can faithfully say we will not be coming back here ever and our truck isn't even done yet. I am dreading to see what else can go wrong. As a customer, we pay a service center to fix our truck, which in turn gives them a job. Obviously these employees are there to just make a paycheck and not be there for the customer at all. Customer satisfaction is not guaranteed when you go to Sierra. A terrible let down. And don't ask to speak to a manager because the rep will just hang up on you. Very unprofessional indeed.<//Review>

Untrustworthy and Dishonest dealership !! We made a deal for 2017 Bolt EV for one lease payment and even ready to sign paper (even when they didn't have car in lot) with John Crawford (Sales) and ED (Finance). They promised us that they will call us once they will have car. I will keep following up every alternate day and John was keep promising me to get that car. Today, I walked to their dealership and that they have car for last 3 days, even on Monday John denied that they don't have car yet!!! Now they asking $5k more . I mean how Sierra can't stick to their words. John and ED you should do what you promised and keep your words.< /Review>

<Text>Customer Service Manager not very friendly. You  have an appointment - it doesn't matter, you still have to wait until the people ahead of you are done. Why bother making appointments!
I went in for a recall ended not getting done since they did not have parts, so they call a month later to do the service. So when I go in a month later, I tell them about another problem (small)  the visor on driver side the cover to the mirror had just fallen off. They said they would fix. I pick up my car, not fixed. They should have said they had to order the part, before telling me that it was ready to be picked up. Now another trip to the dealer. Waste of my time.< /Text><response>None<//response>< user_name>

So far, every Chevy service department I've been to is insanely overpriced to fix the simplest of things. I ended up paying almost 800$ in my last visit, but later finding out it was at most a 600$ fix!
My advice to everyone, befriend a mechanic and get help from them lol<//text>

My HHR was on the waiting list for a new ignition switch on the steering column.  It was a part of the huge GM recall.  Well, worse scenario happened and while shopping one morning I couldn't turn off the ignition.  Stuck. Frozen. Period.
I drove over to Sierra and they hooked up a rental from Hertz and they met me at my house while I parked my HHR, disconnected the battery and pulled a fuse so the car could be turned off.
I had the car for one week.  I got a call that my part was in and I was able to pick my car up the next day.
I was so glad that my car was fixed in a timely manner because anything can happen when you're driving a rental.
Thank you Sierra for taking care of business.

Sincerely,
G. Murray<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>I bought a Traverse in 2012 at another dealership. Sadly, it hasnt been the most reliable vehicle, but thankfully I got extended (multiple) warranties on advice of family that are mechanics (in other states). I was unhappy with level of service at other dealers amd since Sierra is close to work, i decided to try them out. First 4 visits for warranty repair were ok, as my car needed to go back several times and that can be frustrating. At the time, I cant say service was excellent, but, job got done. Mind you, I was back here with repairs every 3 months or so. But this past visit, I am blown away at the semi new staff, especially Juan at Service. This person brings a class above par. I am sooooo happy to visit Sierra just because of Juan and his team. Put it to you this way, im considering buying a new Chevy again just because I am so happy with the level of Service Juan and Sierra has recently improved on and made my service a delight. Thank you Juan and Sierra for your work and excellent customer service.<//text>< Name>

My passenger power seat switch froze, so I took it here to get an estimate on a repair for the switch.  After charging me to diagnose my seat, I was quoted $1300 for a repair as I would need a new seat motor, switch, the seat would have to come out, labor intensive, blah blah....  Went online and found the switch for $80.00, pulled the 5 screws on the side of the seat, put in the new switch, problem fixed.  Took me 15 mins to do.  I would have been faster but had to help my 2 year old use the bathroom.

Stay away from these guys, service advisors are crooks!< /Review>

<text>I would like to commend Oscar Fonseca for going above and beyond in helping me the car I wanted. I called on a Wednesday and spoke to Oscar about what was important to me for my Brand new Malibu 2LT, I expressed strongly what it really needed to have and the color I wanted. Within a few hours Oscar called me back and said I found your car. It was only missing one thing, the rear and front safety sensors. While those are important, they were not going to break the sale. I asked for a price and the next day, Oscar called with a great price. I couldn't believe it. I made an appointment to look at the vehicle the next day. I arrived earlier than expected but that didn't matter Oscar and his team were ready for me. I gave them an estimated time of when I wanted to leave, after a 12 hour day the last thing I wanted was to be at a dealer for 3 plus hours. They managed to reduced my price, wash my car and put gas in it in about an hour and half. Before I left there, my on-star was setup, my wifi was all hooked up, I knew how to use my navigation, and Sirus radio. I couldn't have asked for a better salesperson, Oscar knew what I wanted, he worked hard to get it for me and at the end of the day he made me really happy that I chose to come to Sierra. Oscar truely is an exceptional guy, he did his absolute best to make sure I was happy and I am!! Thank you Sierra Team for all your hard work!!

My entire experience with Sierra Chevrolet, from having my vehicle serviced to the purchase of a new car, has been nothing but excellent!

I unhesitatingly recommend that if you need your car serviced, or you are in the market for a new or pre-owned vehicle, you go immediately to Sierra Chevrolet. You need not look elsewhere.  Sales Consultant Tina Quezada and Sales Manager Michael Hoffman were outstanding!  I can't thank them enough for their courtesy and efficiency in providing me everything that I needed during my visit.  Thanks again Tina and Mike!

Your parts dept. is the worst I have ever dealt with! Always on hold forever and when I go pick up the parts there never busy there just standing around talking and I think to myself is this why I am on hold for so long? I only deal with you guys when Glendora doesn't have what I need. You need to tighten up that customer service guys</text>

funny place. After test driving a BMW 650i, Mercedes SL 550, and a Porsche 911S at 3 separate dealers, this place said 'we don't test drive the stingray corvette'.  Go figure, I guess they think you should shell out your money by imagining what it drives like.  What a bunch of jokers!</Text>

Aaaahhhh! It is hard to be let down by this dealerships service department when my expectations are already so low from all my other experiences in the past, but they never cease to amaze me.  Brought my truck in a month ago for basic service and the very next day my low tire pressure gauge came on.  All four tires were below 25PSI.  SERIOUSLY, COME ON!  On Saturday I brought my wife's tahoe in for basic service and first do you think they noticed the rain gutter that was bent up, which they have supposedly "fixed" twice already?  Of course not!  I got the tahoe back and in less than one hour the low tire pressure light came on showing that the left rear tire had no air (but it was full).  Since it was barely after 4PM I had to bring it back on Monday morning.  And on Monday morning they took over one hour of my life from me for something that probably should have taken ten minutes to hook up to a machine.  Thanks Sierra Chevrolet for making me over an hour behind on my work day.  Please someone open another Chevrolet dealership in the relative area! I'm tired of this.< /text>

I called in and set up an appointment with Joanne. She was super nice, and set me up with an appt. I came in today and walked into the service office. Three men were there, and two looked busy. I approach the third and he just stares at me. He's sitting in the chair... no actually the chair and he have become one. It was as if the chair absorbed his soul and was working him like a puppet. I had already locked eyes and begun the approach so I proceeded.

At this point "Rolando, the chair puppet" gives me a "whatdoyouwantwhydoyoucomeinhereandbotherme?" kind of a greeting. I said that I wanted to get my car repaired, and that the oxygen sensor is acting up. I said I have a warranty contract that I purchased at the Henry Curtis Ford in Petaluma when I bought the car used. I said while you have my car could you see if there is anything else that needs repairing while you're at it. He said "We don't do that. We will only tell you about something if we see it broken in the midst of fixing the problem. You know, like if a part is hanging or something." I look up at their services and fees board, point to the 'Vehicle Inspection N/C' line item. "What's that?" I ask. He says all chipper "That's our 28 point inspection (starts to trail off because he knows he's been caught)... uh we uh check the tire pressure and stuff"

I'm really feeling like his approach to his job is a "Prove your worth and then maybe I'll help you" style. Last I checked we were in a capitalistic society... you know, a 'I give you money and you help me' economy. I guess I stepped into the Club 54 repair place.

Then Rolando comments on my warranty, "I've never seen that warranty before".

"I bought it at the Henry Curtis Ford up in Petaluma"

"Never heard of it. We're GMC." turns to another guy (Jeff) "You heard of this?" Jeff saif no. "All I'm saying is if they pay by check we won't take it"

Now I'm a tad bit aggitated, and when I say a tad bit I mean like the Cuban government and the US government are a tad bit different. I say to Rolando "Aren't you supposed to try the sweets before the punishment?"

He takes my contract and leans over to Jeff with it. "You wanna help this guy? Evidently I'm not nice enough for him."

Wow. Gotta say that I was impressed by the carefree abandon in which he approaches his job security. Rolando, oh giver of annoyance, harbinger of nay saying. I hope one day the chair will release you and you can enjoy life once again...

I'm posting this even though they still have my car. I hope he doesn't spit on the engine or snip my brake lines.</review>

Sierra Chevrolet's service department is not customer service oriented.  You have to call them for statuses and it takes longer than necessary for seemingly routine repairs.  They didn't even wash my car as a good will gesture for my inconvenience.  They get 3 stars for fixing the problem, 2 stars off for lack of customer service.<//review>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Purchased a used HHR in July.  The car was nice but pretty dirtry, they cleaned it up and said it was ready to go.  However, the car encountered quite a few problems and I had to return each time.  The Service department paid for the rental car on two occasions since they did not have a loaner car; this was a kind gesture.  Each problem was superficial (small things) and was taken care of within the day.  They said they changed the brakes but I don't know if that was done as it still makes strange noises and I don't know if it's due to the heat.....

For the moment, nothing major has happened and I'm hoping that it won't .  Rita in the Service départment has always been helpful with a smile.  Since I live near by I usually just walk home but have used their shutlle service which is convenient but sometimes a long wait.

Before I purchase a new vehicle, I'll wait and see how the HHR handles.  If all goes well, I probably will return to Sierra.<//text>< Pics>

I called and scheduled an appointment for service yesterday, oil, lube, and filter, at the Monrovia Sierra location.  My appointment was confirmed for 4:30 pm because apparently that is the latest time available during the week.  That being said I had to take off 2 hours early from my job.  I drove across town and got to the appointment 15 minutes early just to be told that the service center doesn't have lube techs after 3 pm.  This is absolutely unacceptable, why was my appointment confirmed if there was no one that was going to be able to help me?  This is not the first time that I have had issues with the service center but I can tell you that after working with the Monrovia Location for the past 3 years, I am not planning to work with them once this lease is up four months from now.  This saddens me a little because I have always driven GM/Chevy but I now feel I will need to look elsewhere.

As a bonus apparently I left the following review 2 years ago...

If you are planning on dropping the car off for an oil change at 9 am don't plan on picking it up until 5 pm or later.< /Review>

Charge 100 bucks for the service to fix the smell of the air-condition, and they can’t even fix that. I bring car to Jeff marshal last month, he has no idea what need to be done about the air-condition, but charge 100 bucks. About a week later, I bring me car back to him again because the air-condition problem did not solve, “there is anything we can do” the mechanical guy told me that after he recheck my car. Literally helpless, suggest to stay away.<//review>

I will be going back to Sonia's. I might add Alexis is the best to get short haircuts for women in San Bernardino. Searched since 2004 and she is the best stylist for my haircut. Price is great too.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>This place is amazing. They go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and show you what they are talking about. I know nothing about cars but they take the time to explain what is happening so I understand what needs to be fixed and why. They even tell you the priority for repairs so you aren’t overwhelmed with all of them at once. 10/10 would reccomend. I will always bring my cars here<//Text>< Response>

I have a 2004 Tundra with about 200k miles. It needed  major maintenance work because the truck is 17 years old. The mechanic did an excellent job and my old truck is like new. The co-owner Anne was very nice and kept me well informed through the whole process. This business is top notch and I would not hesitate in taking any vehicle to their shop. They are courteous and professional.</Text>

I worked with Ann and she was so honest in regards to my repairs and what I needed.  She didn’t over sell me on work that needed to get done, she just wanted what was necessary done on my car.  That to me is good business!

The technician took pictures and you have a great systems to keep and document work done and what he saw that would need to be done in the future.

I would recommend them to anyone that wants an honest car place to do business with.<//text>

<review>I cannot tell you how happy I am that we found this place! Honest as the day is long and the Service Manager, Ann really knows what she’s talking about.
Everything is explained in the estimate of work and when the job is complete, there are pictures along with the comments showing you exactly what was done.
I am almost reluctant to post this review because if  more people find out about Keep it New it will mean a harder time getting in!

You will not be sorry. Give them a try.</review>< Pics>

This was by far the best experience I have had with an automotive service. I took my newly purchased truck in for a brake inspection anticipating needing brakes. They  fully inspected my brakes and reported I am not on need at this time, but they also did the most thorough inspection of my whole vehicle and documented every component. They spent a half hour going over the most detailed report I have ever seen.  All this without me asking. They did not pressure or push for any service. They did all this without charging me. They have my business going forward.< /review>

<Text>A very reasonable auto shop with affordable prices. My wife has taken her vehicle there for service (2006 Toyota Corolla) and at first, I was hesitant on taking my vehicles there for service, as I’ve always taken them to the dealership. Quite frankly, I’m very impressed with the customer service and “attention to detail” that the mechanics have conducted throughout their inspection and work. I’m definitely getting all my  maintenance for my vehicles done at this auto shop.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Initial impression was that they didn't want or need my business because they are "the busiest shop  in town" as the receptionist told me when I asked why the wait for a diagnostic appt was so long.
Then I was told that since my car didn't always make the noise I  would have to leave it there for a few days. ? When I mentioned this was my only car I was told I could rent a car while they kept it. I dont have the funds to rent car for no reason..
Refused to look at a video I had taken of the noise and the area where it was coming from. Not too helpful. Went to another place with experienced mechanics who looked at my video and was able to then look at the engine around that area, fixed the issue very quickly. Did not even charge me!!  They have a customer for life.( Precision Brake and Front End)< /text>

This was my first service at Keep it New. The service manager was very knowledgeable and friendly. While checking out, an extensive review of the services performed was explained with photographs to demonstrate the current condition of my car. Very impressed</Text>

<text>The 5 Star rating this place has is FOR REAL!

So, with 3 kids, two dogs, and a job that keeps me busy; time is a luxury I don't often have. With that said, I usually pay a little extra at the drive-thru Valvoline Oil Changes so I can get in and out quickly. Well, I finally had a little extra time so I decided to Yelp some local Oil Change places, and this establishment came up with several glowing reviews, so I figured I would give it a try.

I am SOOOOOO happy that I found this place! First off, the price was pretty good for what I got. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I probably saved about 40% from the competition. But, that's not all...for just an oil change, they did a pretty thorough inspection of my vehicle and even documented it with pictures on a report that I got a copy of after the oil change.

Last but not least, was the level of customer service that they provide; most notably Kathy, one of their customer service reps. It's pretty rare you come across someone like this with her elite level of customer service, I promise you that I'm not making this up, she was a true professional.

These guys did a pretty awesome job and I'll be taking ALL my vehicles there from now on. I'm so glad I found this place!< /text><time>1599761208436< /time><user_name>Hai Thai<//user_name>< Rating>

<user_name>Brandy Hodge<//user_name><review>Keep it New Auto Service was very prompt and professional AND the upmost important to me, they were very Kind and honest. The initial oil change is accompanied with a full head to " physical " of your vehicle.  This can seem a bit overwhelming,  however when you take a look at the detail of every single item  reviewed you will begin to appreciate their systems of review

Customer service was excellent !
Especially during this time of restrictions its challenging to be up close and personal, yet i feel as though this company or ( Kathy) provides Individualized customer service.

My acura was serviced efficiently,  and without delay. I was in and out within an hour and came back with
a scheduled appt to have additional simple yet dyer work done, and that too was done with a decent time frame.

I will be coming back for the other work sugeested as time allows.</review>< Pics>

<review>My son has been saving money for years to buy a car and found one that he was very interested in.  We brought it in to Keep It New Auto Service for a pre-purchase inspection.  Wow!  Was that ever a great decision.  The staff were so supportive and provided in-depth analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the car that we were considering.

<Text>I was needing to schedule some routine maintenance for our vehicle. We have never had any done before and I found Keep it New from their great reviews on Google and Yelp. I contacted them and they printed out all of the recommended maintenance for our vehicle and explained everything thoroughly and answered all of my questions.  They were also nice enough to rank what needs to be done from most important to least to give me a road map to eventually get everything done. When speaking to the folks on the phone I felt that everyone there had my best interest in mind and wasn't pushing me to get the highest price item done first. I appreciated the honesty and I really feel like everyone there is honest and trustworthy. I will highly recommend Keep it New to friends, co-workers and family when they need service done on their vehicles.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I came for a simple oil change but received so much more!!  As part of their “getting to know you” deal, they rotate tires and performed a complimentary diagnosis  on the health of my car which also included pictures of the issues they found.  I feel like the personnel at the front desk are just as knowledgeable as the team in the garage. Kathy at the front desk was amazing and I appreciated how she walked me through my car’s diagnosis. Their high quality work and superior customer service is what will keep me coming back!< /Text></record>

I was told the part with sensor cost $400+ dolllars $900 with labor. The same part with sensor at the Lexus dealership cost $245.00 after a 15% discount. Another mechanic will install it for $150. I tried to support my local business during the pandemic but they won't act right.lol</text></record>

I just moved to this area last year and it's a hassle for me to drive over 45 mins to my old mechanic. Found this little gem on Yelp and everyone that works there is amazing. I called in to make an appointment for an oil change and also wanted to know what I can do about my check engine light. Kathy was very friendly and very helpful. She explained in detail about how much it would've cost just to get it diagnosed and what my options were. I felt very comfortable talking with her and didn't feel like they were trying to scam me or anything. After getting my oil changed and tires rotated, Kathy explained everything else that was wrong with my car and what I should do. I LOVED how they did a thorough examination on my car. My side mirror is kinda knocked off and I asked where I can get that fixed, and Anne the other receptionist came out to check on my car and gave me a few options on what to do with that and I was in such awe! These ladies were amazing and I felt very taken care of! Thank you Keep it New Auto service, I will definitely be coming back!< /Review>

Keep it New Auto Service has brought back my trust in auto services. As soon as you walk through the door you are greeted with great care. After my vehicles were serviced they send you an email & text of a total inspection of your car (with photos!) it will tell you what condition your car is in whether is good, moderate, or “bad” (needs repair). From exterior; like tires and brakes to under the hood inspection.
The best part, they aren’t pushy to get additional services done!  I really appreciate their thoroughness. You don’t see a lot of that these days.

Big thumbs up to their advisor, Kathy who is a joy to talk to. She is very knowledgeable and helpful.< /review>

<Text>This was my first time at Keep It New Auto Service and they have to be the BEST auto shop I have ever been too. From the minute I stepped through the door, Kathy and Ann were extremely welcoming! After having an oil change, Kathy gave me a full report on a general inspection they had done on my car. I usually get really anxious when it comes to car issues but I felt very comfortable because of the fact that Kathy was very comforting and extremely thorough at explaining exactly what they had found and how they would fix it. She is one friendliest people I have ever met, she’s fantastic. Great job Keep It New, I will definitely be coming back!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I can’t not say enough about Keep It New. They were a referral to me, and I will refer them to everyone I know. They exceed expectations and go above and beyond to do the right thing for their customers. I will never take our cars anywhere else. They have proven to be honest, trustworthy, hardworking, and truly in the business to help people.< /text>

< Review>
Put Keep It New Auto Service on your Great list.  Finding an automotive service partner can be a stressful experience.  Not only is the average consumer unable to repair their own vehicle, but often lacks the context to even evaluate a potential service facility.  I chose Keep It New Auto Service based on outstanding customer reviews and am pleased to report I was not disappointed.  The team was thorough, provided excellent communication along the way, and quality service.  It is very clear the Keep It New Auto Service operating philosophy is guided by doing what is right for both customer and vehicle.<//Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>First time using "Keep It New". Great experience in booking and over the phone. Prompt and serviced on time. Great communications about items wrong with my car. Price quotes for repairs look on average, but with the customer service you're getting good value for money. Provided me information to also assist me in fixing some of the repairs myself. Already  using them to service my other car, and will be getting them to fix some items I'm not capable of doing.< /Review>< pictures>

I would never bring my vehicles anywhere but Keep it New.  They are honest, and don’t try to over sell you on services or parts you don’t need. Always pleased with the service and price.  Linn is a very sharp guy, and mechanic. You can’t go wrong at Keep it New< /text>

<Text>I have been getting my car serviced it at Keep It New Auto Service since 2016 and I couldn’t be happier with their service. First off I absolutely adore their office staff, talk about great customer service! The mechanics have done a great job with the repairs, I have never had any issues. I would highly recommend them for your auto service needs!< /Text>< pics>

I've known Linn for over 20 years now. I wouldnt take my cars any where else. Keep it New is honest, professional and they always do a great job. I refer everyone I know who needs a mechanic to them. The ladies who work the front are very personable and knowledgeable. Best place if you need a mechanic.<//Review>

<userid>112569785499258649486< /userid><Review>I came in with my air conditioner not blowing cold air. Freon would only last a day. Temperatures in the Eastbay were getting up to the 100s so I had to get this fixed. I heard good things about Keep It New through the Nextdoor app so I decided to give them a try.

I set an appointment and came in to drop off my car. Kathy took my information and couldn't be nicer. She instantly felt like family.  Later that day, Ann sent me the most detailed report of my car I've ever seen. She included pictures of the areas were the leaking from the dye they introduced into my AC system. I can see for myself without having to jack my car up and rip it all apart. They do this for you and take pictures. It may not be a big deal for other customers but I was amazed. Keep It New also looked into other areas of my car to give me holistic view of the recommended repairs for my vehicle. Ann also reached out to me by phone and explained everything to me like I was her only customer. She was also SUPER knowledgeable about the repairs and I was able to bounce ideas off of her without her having to get the mechanic. It was as though, she was the mechanic. It made me feel that I made the right choice to come to Keep It New.

Later that week, I came in to pick up my car. Ann showed me the old parts and gave me evidence of the new colder temps my car was pushing out. Its been a few days and the AC system has great. It's was 101 yesterday but inside my car it was very cool and comfortable.

Keep It New may not have the cheapest rates in the area but what you will find is a friendly, knowledgeable staff and a team who truly cares about getting your car problems fixed and you back on the road. I was very happy with the whole experience and will certainly be back to support this local business.<//Review>< GmapID>

<Review>Best service of any auto service company I have ever used.  The office staff is great and the techs do very good work.  I really like to complete printouts and diagnostics they do so I have a complete picture of what was done plus what will need to be done in the future.  I think they are a little pricey but to me it is worth it for the service and work guarantees.  I would highly recommend Keep It New for all auto repair or maintenance needs.< /Review>< Name>

<Text>New It New Auto is THE best place I have ever used for car servicing! Sometimes we have a hard time getting our car in because our lives are so busy—we appreciate being able to drop after hours to have our car taken care of the next business day. I also truly appreciate Ann, the service manager who always goes above and beyond to help me to schedule my car for service, explain everything in full of what needs to be done, and most of all I am always treated like family there. From Linn, the owner...to Ann and everyone else who supports all of our service at Keep it New...our family appreciates each and every one of you!  :)</Text>< Pics>

<review>My 2006 GMC Denali was serviced here. Our bill was over $3100 dollars. We returned the truck due to the truck was not driving well as they stated. After a 2nd drive test, it was obvious the two diagnosis tests we received were wrong. We were told AFTER we paid $3100 dollars, we needed a new transmission. Immediately,  I had my truck towed from this shop to Contra Costa Auto Service. After running a diagnostic test, they told me my truck needed at least $9K worth of work and recommended I don't put another dime in this truck. They APOLOGIZED for Keep it New and said they wish I had brought the truck to them first. Thank God there are still honest mechanics around. Think twice before coming to this place!<//review>< Date>

<response>{'time': 1597172645818, 'text': "Yvette,\nIn regards to your O6 Denali with 317 thousand miles, I'm also very unhappy with the outcome of this. Our goal has always been to inform our clients of the best course of action for their needs.\nIn this case I believe your service advisor explained to Camden your son exactly the above and informed him with pictures and explanation of everything we could currently see.\nHowever despite our warning of caution your son opted to proceed with immediate concerns in hope the rest of the vehicle would continue to function for you.\nI might also add that your SON paid the bill of $2808. You have stated $3100 which is untrue. Either way it is a lot of money for the outcome.\nKeep in mind that the bill was a combination of items that Camden wanted done, all belts, headlights, running lights, all wipers, oil change, window regulators for inoperative windows, axle shafts.\nYour original concern was screeching that was ultimately resolved with brakes from the rear which on 8-6-20 we drove with you and confirmed that the original problem was gone.\nHowever on that test drive the concern from you was that the transmission is slipping (keeping in mind that this is now 4 weeks after original repair), which we identified with you on that day and then what we found was transmission internal problem and Kathy then advised Camden that any further money spent was not a good idea.\nAs a result of your request, we provided an estimate for a new transmission, mainly to prove our point that this was too much money to spend at 317,000 miles, after you just finished with other issues AND\nespecially since it still didn't address the massive oil leaks that were documented and pictures provided to you on 7-8-20.\nAt that point Camden experiencing sticker shock requested a used transmission, we replied that we do NOT recommend spending any more on the vehicle and refused to be a party to the incorrect spending.\nYou then towed the vehicle to another shop who fortunately convinced you this time not to spend any more.\nKeep in mind Im not writing this blindly, Ive reviewed EVERY invoice, phone call recording, Digital Inspection and spoke with both techs and the service advisor relating to this to come to one final conclusion.\nAll I can do is have my crew explain the facts to a customer, advise them the best course, and if they go too far out of bounds We decline to be part of it, but thats what we did, and then We get this review?\nI get that your upset that after spending money on one problem, another arose and in hind site it would have been wise heed the advise of people who actually do have your interest at heart.\n\nLinn"}</response><UserId.>111663809674873231301</UserId.></record>

<Review>I brought my car to Keep It New on July 13th, 2020z Im really grateful that Linn was able to service my vehicle on such a short notice. Before bringing it to Keep It New, I tried 3 Firestone’s and 1 Wheel Works and I still couldn’t find anyone that would help me on such a short notice. I was getting ready to drive to North Carolina for nursing school the very next day— then my check engine light came on.

So, I just hoped Linn would be able to take care of me. Of course, in true Linn fashion, he keeps the rapport with his customers. Kathy (She’s a saint) saw how stressed I was and she really had the best customer service. They took care of me and I will not forget how they helped me when I really needed it. Thank you Linn and thank you Ms Kathy! Y’all are lifesavers.< /Review>< Name>

<text>I found this company on yelp abd the reviews were really good. I went to them once before to get my brakes and oil change done. Kathy was the one that helped me throughout my visit. She was great and helpful.

I recently when to them for a second time for an emergency visit. My car wouldnt start and the check engine light was on including a couple other lights. I had my car towed there from my house because it wouldnt start. I called ahead of time prior to the tow truck driver bringing in my car. I was told it was ok to have it towed there and they would check it out.

They couldn't start my car either and asked for my original key to be brought in. So i had my sister bring the keys in since i was at work. When she got there to give the keys, I believe she was helped by Ann and some other guy. My sister had suggested they should try to take the transponder out of the new key and put it back into the old key so see if that would make the car stary. The guy that worked there said that would be a good idea so he mentioned the idea to Ann. Ann refused to do my what my sister suggested and said no because thats not gonna be a fix to the problem because her original key so beat up anyways. So Ann said all shes gonna do is put the new and old key next to each other and try to start it again with the new key which again did not work. Ann suggested I have my car towed to a dealership and buy a whole new key and have them program the new key.

Ann said the could not diagnose my car without being able to start it, but still refused to do my sister suggestion. They still ended up charging me even though all they did was try to out the key in the ignition. Basically was charged for them to do nothing. I told had my sister take both my old and new keys back from them. I put the original key all back together and went to the shop and started my car no problem.

If Ann didnt refuse to put the original key back together they would have been able to start my car and diagnose it to see why all these lights were on in my car.

Kathy who helped me the first visit is awesome which is why i didn't hesitate to go back there for my emergency situtation. I am hesitant to go back there again because Ann was so resistant to try a customers suggestion which would have helped them to get a diagnosis for my car.

I almost wasted more money towing it to a dealership and buying a whole new key. I went back to ace where i bought my new key. The worker there looked at the old and new key and told me the chip was still in the old key. He even verified that if they had put the old key back together it would have solved the problem of getting my car to start.

My 1 star rating is for Anns service, but everyone else especially Kathy have awesome service.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I recently had my Subaru XV Crosstrek Hybrid serviced at Keep It New Auto Service. I had been worried that something was wrong with my car since buying it used, and Keep It New settled all of my fears. I received an oil change, tire rotation, and inspection, and the staff was unbelievably friendly and knowledgeable. Their technicans and service advisor gave me EXCELLENT advice about when to service my car and how, and they are clearly looking our for our mental health, safety, and finances! I could not have been more satisfied as a first time customer, and I am thrilled to have found my regular mechanic from now on! Thank you to Keep It New for all you do, you are an amazing, knowledgeable, and hard working team! You're the best!< /review>

Great experience here at Keep It New. I have a 2019 Honda Odyssey and needed a B1 Service completed. Winter Honda quoted me 3x the amount Keep It New quoted me - so obviously it was a no brainer where I would be taking my services. On top of that they honored the 20% discount I informed them of. Highly recommend coming here to get routine services done on your vehicles!< /text>

<text>Car repairs can be expensive. I appreciated their honesty. I was told by another car service location that I needed a few things repaired, including new front brakes and that my car battery was in "good" working order. Going to Keep it New, they told me, I in fact had a bad battery and made the needed exchange. They also told me my brakes we just fine. They assisted me with costs as well as a ride home via arranging an Uber</text><Response>{'time': 1579883031136, 'text': 'Thank you Cristina for allowing us to help out with your Honda repairs, Thank you for your feedback.'}<//Response>< Rating>

Got into my scheduled appointment without incident,  decided to wait for my car.  It sure seemed the repair's /maintenance's were done in a ridiculously short amount of time.  I was out of there before I knew it.
I will only take my cars to this firm.</review>

< Review>
Appointment time frame -Excellent
Customer Service - Excellent
Auto Knowledge - Excellent

Advertisement - Bait and switch. Single axle brake service with rotors turned. $150. My quote because my rotors couldn’t be turned over $500. More labor is involved turning rotors than putting on new ones. The cost of the rotors if you do the math is well over $300 by their quote? I can buy rotors for $70 to $150 depending on the quality. I’m sure they get them for less than what I can buy them.  A quote for $300 would seem more appropriate.

Not sure if I would use them again even with their good service and strong auto knowledge.< /Review>

<Review>Thank you Keep It New Auto service for the best customer service experience ever! Kathy is amazing! She communicated with me 100% with what was going on with my Car keeping it real! Did an awesome job telling me whats wrong with the car through there diagnostic process did almost $700 in repair then at the end to find out I needed a new engine in which they don’t handle. They Waived the $700 cost they put into my car and only charged me the $145  diagnostic fee! Simply Amazing! Thank you for your time and professional efforts! Will always go back to them!  Kathy and team are the best!</Review>< Pics>

The folks at Keep it New are amazing from the moment you walk into their lobby to the work done on your car. The staff is pleasant, very service oriented and everyone seems to love their job. They are flexible with appointment times and set an expectation when your car will be ready and the prices are fair. I feel they they are honest and that is worth the price you pay.. I will be a forever customer. Thanks to everyone at Keep it New.<//review>

Keep It New Auto shows me the respect and professionalism I never received from an automobile Repair Company. Other companies are difficult to trust and unreliable. KINAS seems to care, they get the job done the right why and they don't dont cut any corners. They have done something no other automobile business has ever done... Earned My Trust!< /review>

We moved here 4 years ago and drug 3 cars with us. I found "Keep it new" on line and was led there by the reviews. I love the service and friendly staff at the counter. They have my Saturn and Tacoma running great. Now my Sienna is in for brakes and other small maintenance. They did a full free inspection and sent a quote with pictures via email. Then they call  and go over whatever needs to be addressed in detail.  The prices are always a bit better than the going rates. At least they have been for whatever I've needed. I am truly happy with the service and appreciate the piece of mind they give me. When I drive that van home tomorrow I'm confident it will be in perfect shape. Update, it was. Thank you guys!!< /review>

Let me start off by saying Kathy is very friendly and helpful. She always has a good attitude and willing to help. This auto shop has never let me down. They also inspect your car and address any other issues your car may have that you may have not been aware of . They also provide photos of the issues so you know they're not just trying to get money out of you for no reasonn. Kathy went over my inspection report with the priorities first. I will definetely be back for all my vehicles to fixed her .</text>

I felt like they actually cared about fixing the problem I was having with my car. Everywhere else I have gone fix what the think it is but never actually fixed the problem. These guys dug in my engine until they actually found the problem. Ann kept me very informed as to what was going on and when parts would be there and so on. They are very honest and reasonable. I can’t recommend them enough!</text>

Love having this team of professionals work on either of my car's. I love how they do a complete evaluation of your vehicles and provide pictures and detailed information as to what you vehicles needs now/later or something to keep an eye on. Rima and Lin in the front office are super! They talk to you not at you and you don't feel like there trying to pull the wool over your eyes. The Technician's are great and will stop if they feel what is being done isn't the right thing to focus on, much appreciated. I highly recommend Keep it New for any and all you vehicle needs!</review>

<Review>Quick, friendly, thorough, and reasonable. I appreciate that the inspection and diagnostic data was presented in an easy to follow format sent via email. The results of the diagnostic also included images of their findings with action recommended to correct the problem. I couldn't believe all of this, plus a compression check, was under $150.00. This is the 1st and only time I have been there. I found my shop for future needs.</Review>< pictures>

I went to the 2nd highest rated shop on Yelp (Keep it New was #1). I ended up back at Keep it New. They are #1 for a reason. There customer relations are 10/10. They are very thorough with their inspections and have a system designed to let you know what checked out good, what needs to me monitored, and what needs to be delt with now. I like the record keeping system because it allows me to pre plan my next service appointments. Prices are fair and I don’t ever feel like I’m being taken advantage of.

Stephen and Marcos did a FABULOUS job on my truck!  It runs like new now.  I had a problem with the MAF sensor that my husband tried to fix twice unsuccessfully.  It turned out that my truck needed the more expensive sensor.  Also, another mechanic told me my truck needed new valves.  The guys had the experience to know that didn't make sense based on the engine I have.  If you're looking for a place that doesn't try to fool you AND does excellent work, you'll find it here.<//Text>

This was my first time using this auto service  and I would highly recommend them.

I had a problem with my Prius and they gave me a comprehensive and completely honest evaluation of what the car needed.

The ladies at the front desk were amazing. Excellent customer service!!

I will recommend them to everyone I know in town and use them next time I need an honest and reliable mechanic.</Review>

Me and my family just moved to Brentwood and needed a great friendly auto repair shop and we found Keep It New by our house, the entire experience was professional. Anne was my service writer she was awesome keeping me updated with calls, messages and pics of detailed work. Im most definitely making this my home repair shop.  Thank you lot Keep It New you guys are great.</Review>

I recently brought my older vehicle in to Keep It New Auto Service for AC Repair that I had been putting off.  I was pleasantly assisted by Rima over the phone who scheduled an appointment for me immediately.  I must say that the office staff is very knowledgeable, efficient, friendly, and accommodating.  They truly represent "great customer service".  They answered all my questions with confidence and assured me that I would be taken care of.  They also addressed other maintenance/repairs for my vehicle and gave me estimates for everything without pressuring me to do any of the work.  I carefully reviewed the recommendations, scheduled the appointment and had the work completed.  Everything seems to be working great so far, and I also like that they schedule follow-up appointments at no charge to make sure all is good!  They really want to make sure that you are satisfied.  I found my new local auto repair shop and would recommend them to anyone in need of one as well.</Text>

We're very happy we discovered Keep It New Auto Service.  We had a garage in Arroyo Grande that we were sad to leave, but Keep It New has erased those sad feelings.  Linn and his staff are accommodating and pleasant to work with.  We appreciate the quick turn-around time on the appointments.   The email with a summary of work done and the recommendations for future repairs needed to keep our cars working "like new" is very helpful.</text>

They have kept my Prius up ever since I decided to abandon the high prices and low service of the dealer.  It's great to spend less money for more service!  I thought I would miss the shuttle, but when I think about how much that was costing in the long run, it is a no brainer....<//text>

<text>Horrible communication and customer service. I made an appointment to get my brakes serviced and after two hours with no phone call, I called the office. They did not communicate to me that they were only giving me an estimate. I thought they were replacing my brakes. I was very frustrated because I work full time and it was my only day off. They told me they were overloaded that day and serviced too many cars...Well, maybe they shouldn't overload themselves because they definitely lost my business. Upon driving away, I heard popping and it felt like I was dragging something under my car. They left the parking brake half way on. Ugh. I am so frustrated and will NEVER go there again!<//text><Gmap_id>0x808ffec1e03ee421:0xcf6dc52345173cb8< /Gmap_id>< resp>

<Review>Overpriced even more than the dealer. Charged $343 for a part that is $52 or less online.<//Review>< Resp>
{'time': 1560875384888, 'text': "Ahmad, Thank you for the input on the price difference with your Toyota Check Engine Light, we are constantly trying to make sure you get a fair price while still paying for cost of doing business and standing behind our work with the longest warranties for parts and labor in the business. HOWEVER, I can not find a price anywhere remotely close to the $52 you are claiming? I'm wondering if you are misunderstanding what is coming up on your search, this is not the same part, there are multiple choices for the same named part, which are incorrect unless you know which one you are specifically looking for.  Try the search again but this time identify an AIR Fuel ratio Sensor, which is massively  different then the suspected downstream sensor your identifying as $52.  Thanks again for the input, always good to keep us in check, however publicly I believe should be your second choice if you cant resolve it with our Friendly staff.  Further I am happy the vehicle is now running as designed, and the check engine light is gone, also the extra mile we took that we didn't charge you for as far as the Sensor being rusted into the exhaust, and I'm also hoping the $100 discount we gave you has helped you out also."}< /Resp>

Professionally managed, experienced, honest & trustworthy. I used to drive far for routine car maintenance and issues; but once started with Keep IT new since 1+years, I have been going and recommending to my friends. Some of my friends already went and they are very happy with the service. Great to have this kind of outlet locally and very proud to support local.</text>

< review>
I have a 2011 Lexus RX350 and having a trunk pull-down motor problem for a while and had to open and close the truck manually.
I finally decided to fix it, called several auto repair shops in my city, and found out they were not sure how to fix it.
When I called 5 Star Auto Repair in Pomona, they explain to me there are several steps to diagnose the problem.
2 days ago, they replaced the ‘trunk pull down motor’ and now I can open and close the trunk with a push of a button.
I really like their service and love price too.
Highly recommend.</review>

James has put 2 Engines in my 2006 Chevy Impala and a engine in my son's S10 truck. He has worked on my husband's Titan and has done repairs on all our vehicles over many years. He is honest and his mechanics do good work. I highly recommend his shop!</Review>

My new favorite lunch place.  The staff is incredibly nice, the food is always good, and the prices are reasonable.  What more can you ask for? They will continue to get my business!<//review>

<Review>I love JB's! They have the best sandwiches and salads! The Shrimp Caesar Salad is fire! 🔥🔥🔥 Especially of you get it with the grilled bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms. The Tri-Tip, and cheese steak sandwiches are everything! 😋 The staff is amazing too, they always go above and beyond! They go the extra mile for their customers and take the time to get to know them!❤<//Review>< Pictures>

<review>Great service by their staff! My friends had a surprise birthday celebration there for me. The waitress herself volunteered to help us cut the cake and give us plates and forks. Wonderful service! Their burgers and sandwiches too are really good. Highly recommend this place.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXDh55NFuEd-bF2YJuLT7bEk9FfgI7ZTqigAvG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808f7fcc625419af:0x9a8fb86da516cef4< /gmap_id></record>

I go here very often, almost every week and their customer service is awesome. They greet me by name and they create some sort of cool relationship with the customers. Food is all about sandwiches, and some specialties they cook every day and from time to time a special plate which is usually really good. My favorite sandwich is the tuna melt, club chicken sandwich and veggie sandwich. I love their pastries and you can get regular coffee or espressos. This place is like no other and I really love how they treat me. Thank you for all you do.< /review>

Went there on my lunch break and it was 3 minutes away by driving. Parking was scarce but not impossible. I'd call ahead if you're trying to get it to go or are in more of a rush or have a larger party.
We went in and the place was mostly empty with a couple customers waiting for their food to go. We had plenty of time to eat and dip.
Food was awesome! They have a wide selection of options from burgers to breakfast to burritos to sandwiches. Can't go wrong<//text>

JB's is one of the best sandwich places in the city. Is it the best sandwich you'll ever eat? No, but for the price, service, friendliness and options it's an easy recommendation. The staff are wonderful and the owner is great.<//review>

My coworkers and I go to JB's about twice a month and have done so for several years. The staff is always very friendly. The food is very good. It's typical diner fare with sandwiches and breakfast items. Prices are also very reasonable. If you're really hungry, I suggest JB's Big Breakfast. It's two plates worth of meat & potatoes. Vegans and halal diners need not consider this order; but the cooks are flexible and will do their best to make whatever you want.</review>

The best breakfast with the best service. When I'm really hungry and need to be happy all day I come to JB'S place, the service is gracious and the food is delicious at a reasonably able price, I had the JB'S special with three eggs, hash browns, home made sausage, bacon and sliced ham. This will keep me going all day.< /review>

Open only on weekdays, this is a reassuringly old-fashioned lunch joint. The portion sizes are large and the prices are reasonable. You wouldn't expect the quality of the food at a place like this to win awards, and it doesn't, but I've never had anything here to complain about. You can expect a few hot entrees that change daily, along with a fairly extensive permanent menu. The selection outside the hot entrees consist mainly of sandwiches, burgers, and salads, though you can also quickly grab a prepackaged bagel with cream cheese. Actually, the quality of their salads may surprise you, and they carry both prepackaged salads as well as at least a ceasar salad that you can order at the counter. You can polish your meal with a pick from among several options of pastries and donuts. Their fridge is stuffed with an impressively wide selection of bottled drinks and their salty snack and candy bar selection is also wider than what I'd consider average for a place of this scale. There are 10 or so small tables inside and two or three two-person tables just outside the door, but no one would call this place spacious. The flow that consists of ordering at the counter, picking up your food, and paying at the cashier is not exactly streamlined, so this ordering-and-paying process could get a little clogged and confusing when things are really busy at the height of the lunch rush. When the place is more empty, you won't even notice any problem with this though.</Text>

The food here is spot on. If you're in a rush call ahead and order. The staff are friendly as well. The tri-tip sandwich is a go to for sure.</review>

<review>This place is awesome! It's not a 5-star restaurant, but they're quick, friendly, and it's old fashioned customer service that you won't find in most places in the city. Looking for a sandwich, a breakfast burrito, our a huge breakfast for fairly inexpensive? This is your place.</review><response>None<//response><date>1512696255316< /date>< userid>

Fresh food, best deli sandos on and near potrero hill. I love the daily special. If im feeling like comfort food i tend to choose the special. Fast service friendly they are always on point. I love the shredded lettuce in the sandwich the detail they put in the sandwich makes up the best.<//text>

Amazing local place run by a great couple. Come in for reasonably priced breakfast burritos, salads, sandwiches and coffee. Good place to work - they have WiFi - or eat and chat. Quick, counter service food.< /Review>

Simple, classic neighborhood lunch spot with no-nonsense service and a surprising amount of seating, both indoor and outdoor.  The gyro platter is delicious and the pulled pork sandwich is even better, though their "hot food" buffet is less compelling.< /text>

This buffalo wild wings was awesome. The staff was quick and the cost of lunch was extremely reasonable. I ordered a Southwest chicken sandwich with a side salad with balsamic vinaigrette. The waiter informed me that they might not have anything but ceaser, so I told her fries would work if they were out of salad. She returned with both! The chicken sandwich was so juicy. I even used the balsamic vinaigrette as a dip for the ever so soft bread the sandwich came on. Finger licking. I would most certainly visit again.</text>

<date>1620611859443<//date><rating>1< /rating><Review>My family and I love BWW. Unfortunately, this particular BWW has been nothing but challenging to say the least. I have ordered from there multiple times and have always been disappointed in one way or another. With every order, something would be incorrect or missing (even if I paid for it) and it would take a ridiculous amount of time to prepare. It took nearly 2 hours for our food to be ready today, we received a quarter of a portion of a large fry (practically an empty box), the sauce we paid for wasn't in the bag, and the chicken was dry and disappointing to say the least. You'd think I would learn not to order from there again, but this location is the only one in our area. We won't be returning...lesson learned.<//Review>< pictures>

Felt like Outdoor seating was just for name sake to show Covid protocols are followed. We asked them to turn on the heater burner multiple times but was told they were out of propane and manager went out to get it....spent almost 3.5hrs there propane never arrived and it was never turned on.....and even the service was too slow for outdoors...<//Review>

No refills and they never checked in on us

<text>-5  The worst experience.  1st - Had to wait 25 mins to be seated and than to find the tables half empty.  Ordered House Sampler and nothing on my plate resembled the House Sampler.  Chicken was so dry and not sure what the container in photo was that I had peel off crusted top layer. And to make matters worst, I  had to walk over to bar and get my water glass refilled. Never saw our waitress again until I asked for the check.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPK1l6jTA5fCLz8BMGRJhtZJmxVmlq4a7vb1E0X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxjB5FeshITHr285jmPiSzjFX0mT0Rf5cKRFL7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Though it was open for outdoor seating,  had to wait for 45 minutes though they had vacant tables due to lack of staff...I would recommend order all the items in one go..it took 20 minutes after being seated to someone to take your order and then another 30 minutes for the order to arrive. Take out might be a better option< /text>

Me and my buddy stopped by after a round 9f golf. And we were seated at around 150pm but no server assisted us until around 15 minutes later. ( we were the only ones there). We went to pace our orders but we couldn't get the lunch specials cause it was 2:10 pm. Didn't matter we sat twindling our thumbs waiting for service. We ordered appetizers and asked to have them before our meal and that didn't happen.  They were all brought out at the same time and the appetizers were cold and the buns on the burgers  tasted stale.  Won't be going back there again no wonder no one was there<//Text>

Service is slow. Were told they prioritize eat-in customers over take-out. Orders placed online seem to take an extra 20-30min from promised time. Food is okay... doesn't always seem fresh and potato wedges ordered seemed bottom of the bag because the wedges given were small like potato chips almost. Also chicken tenders are never available although part of menu.<//review>

Had nothing but bad experiences here.  By far the worst BWW I have ever been to. Food is bad, beer always flat, service is even worse. The rudest and most inattentive wait staff I’ve ever encountered. Even the manager was a completely rude Karen for no reason . Wish I could give 0 stars. Do yourself a favor, take your hard earned money elsewhere.<//Text>

<Response>None</Response><text>Awesome place to hangout with friends, family and even with kids. Great variety of drinks and yummylicious food.
Usually our first preference is a kid friendly place and those places don't offer great variety of drinks for grown ups. But this restaurant breaks that norm and has great variety for kids menu and adult drinks. That's a bonus.
Staff is very friendly and accommodative. Place is great and very good service. Plus one for the ambience. Would definitely recommend this place!</text></record></dataset><record>

Always been a big fan of BWW despite the usual shoddy service. Maybe it was just busy and hectic, but this time after waiting a bit we were told another 10 minutes; no big deal. We ended up waiting an hour for our food, just for them to tell us that they couldn't find an order, so we had to wait more. Definitely avoid if you're in a hurry. Gave an extra star just because the wings are always good, but the service is notoriously slow.</text>

The wings are great! My husband still likes the traditional over the boneless style. Great variety of sauces and seasonings. I just wish that the menu would be more diverse in it's food offerings. Otherwise, as a sports bar (no shortage of huge TVs around) and as a wings restaurant, it's doing pretty good!<//Text>

I did a mobile order earlier today for 12 boneless wings, only received 5. Called and came back to get my order fixed and the manager was very nice and accommodating, even gave my a few extra wings! I'm very happy with how things went.</review>

Menu is good with a lot of variety, burgers,chicken, all the usual dinner selections. I had the boneless wings and bacon and cheese fries both came out cold, my burger was fine, so im thinking they were cooked first and left there until burger was ready. Sent them back and got fresh order of both. When it came to pay i was charged for both orders and at the end of recipet it was deducted(pointless and confusing) i then asked for 2 mini desserts and got one large and one mini. My server Thao needs to be re trained in my opinion.< /Text>

Great food but service is exceptionally slow during weekday lunch. I've had to worry about running past the one hour of free EV charging (provided by the shopping center) outside while coming in for lunch almost every time I've come, and today I had to rush outside to unplug my car to avoid a fee. The food is really great, even compared to other Buffalo Wild Wings locations which is why I keep coming back. I shouldn't have to be worried if my lunch break will run late though. Once a server helps you it's generally fine.<//Text>

<response>None< /response><review>Ordered a buffalo salad,  that came with a great amount of old lettuce,  no garlic bread and over cooked crispy chicken, that tasted like it had been in the freezer for over a year. My daughters boneless buffalo wings also tasted like they've been in the freezer for over a year. And my husband ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. The sandwich was a little bigger than a slider and maybe a small handful of fries. Very disappointed . We will not be back.< /review><date>1575848679523<//date>< Rate>

The food is good and it comes out fairly quickly. However, the bartenders always seem inexperienced and they don't walk around the bar to check on you often. If you don't mind hollering at them, they will serve you.</Text>

I wish I could give a good review but, we walked in the girl said 2 I said yes and she walked away. They sat the people before us which is fine and then they started seating people who came in after us. I walked to the stand talked to a nice gentleman and told him what had happened. He looked at the sheet and there was a blank name and the number 2 next to it. She never wrote my name! Gentleman wrote my name said I would be seated next, the original girl came back took another couple and then no hostess ever came back they were waiting tables so we left. I am never going back to the Buffalo wild wings in Pacific Commons again.<//review>

< review>
I went here twice. Terrible Experience both times. I was as the the bar. It's like waiting for 100 years to order something and for order to arrive. I was there for the UFC game night twice In 2 months. They really need to work on their Bartender servers. Zero efforts. I had to remind my order twice, thrice.
This dessert took 30 mins to arrive. HORRIBLE SERVICE</review>

<text>Have frequented this particular establishment over the past six months with varying degrees of acceptability.  Food is generally good, although the happy hour prices are unbeatable!  Staff could use a "tune up" in terms of customer service expectations and how to keep customers returning. I will say it depends on who you get in terms of great or poor service. Appearance that friends receive great service while infrequent visitors are sometimes forgotten.  Appears to be a social event for most of the staff. Cell phones must be a prerequisite to working at the place as everyone is using them!

Ironic to the situation is that employees purchase food from other establishments, bring it in the facility, and eat at tables designated for customers.  Does this mean the food they serve is unacceptable?<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808fc76b4882a269:0x779a511bbae4cca2< /gmap_id></record>

< Review>
I give it a 2 star just because some of the food is good. This used to be a great place to go for great food and friendly and attentive staff. Now a days the staff is walking around with their phones on their hands and not paying attention to the tables. I went in yesterday and found the cabbage in my coleslaw with mold. They never put napkins and don’t come around enough to see if you need anything. If you order something in addition to dinner they take forever to bring it or simply forget it.</Review>

<text>This is a really nice casual place to eat. The food is as expected from a chain like this. Not always the best but usually pretty standard. Some wings are a little less seasoned than others, but the staff will get you new ones if you ask them. The prices are also pretty standard and to be expected from a place like his. The staff is really what earns it 4 stars. They are nice attentive and very on top of refills and things like that. The pace is clean and the seats are pretty comfortable. There is also plenty of parking. Overall a great place for a small party and very fun to visit. Food comes quickly, the staff is great and the restaurant is nice and clean!</text>< Pictures>

Bad pickup experience, and horrible table service :
I had a pickup order which I was told was picked by someone else, waited for next 20 mins to get it made all over again.

Meanwhile I ordered a chicken sandwich to have it there, they brought me a beef burger ??

Now I wish I didn't pay the tip <sigh> ! Will never visit again, server was trying to justify !< /review>

Perfect set-up tons of tv's, huge floorplan, smooth layout, killer sound system, great music, and a staff that emulates a championship team of any sport. Jerseys of every sports team you could imagine can be seen here. No problems, just great service, beer, food, and if you have space for it, dessert. Great location and excellent service. Chalk up a win for #82, Buffalo Wild Wings straight outta Ohio. When you visit this location, ask for Simona, she is the best in the biz, hands down.< /Text>

Hot wings and televisions.  That pretty much sums up Buffalo Wild Wings.  The wings are actually pretty good and they have a wide range of sauces from mild to burning.  The TV's are all over, but mounted high enough that you can avoid seeing them all the time, and they leave the sound off.  Which is good, because that much sports TV is way too much to talk over.  The service at lunch was fast and the wait staff was good.<//Review>

<Review>First time getting wings from this restaurant.  The online ordering experience was quick and easy.  The price was reasonable.  Picking up the order was also quick with a friendly staff.  The wings, traditional wings with Buffalo medium hot sauce, did not meet my expectation.  I ate tons of wings when I went to school in Buffalo, NY and this was not it..

Update 7/24.  Take-out service was friendly and quick.  After I get home I found that the celery and carrots were missing.  I ordered with sauce on the side and I liked it better this way.  3 stars.

Update 8/20.  Take-out service was friendly and quick again.  The celery and carrots were in the bag.  I ordered with the sauce on the side.  The wings were really dry this time.  Back to 2 stars.

If you wondered why I kept going back since I thought the wings were mediocre.  Well, cause I have a $100 gift card that I want to use up.  Maybe I should order something other than the wings next time?</Review></record>

<Text>I asked them for birthday shout for my friend they didn’t give it and the waiters were very arrogant.
This happened twice with two of my friends and we never got a birthday shout...
They don’t even come and ask for drink refills.
Never visit this place when anyone has a birthday.
Even the food was average because the wings over fried and were very hard not juicy.
Waste of money and you end with disappointment.< /Text>< pictures>

Terrible customer service. My experience begins with the host dropping a glass of soda on my shoes not even apologizing for it, made me wait for a table a very long time only because she did not like that I asked for a bigger table. When I asked for a manager Travis came to the rescue. The rescue of the host that. His customer service skills were worst than a DMV clerk before lunch time. My incident happened 11/15/19 now 1/28/20. And have not received a call back from uper management. When I explained the server what was going on she made it very clear that is not uncommon for managers to get away with the type of bad service I received.I have never been back and will not be back. Ok food terrible service</review>

The food is very good here and there is a lot you can customize with your wings. Anywhere you sit, there is a good view of a TV. Ths place is very popular though so the only problem is that the service is slow. The servers are very nice and welcoming though.< /Text>

I'm a big fan of boneless chicken "wings".  Buffalo Wild Wings is usually my favorite simply because they have some a great selection of sauces to go with it.  Also, their lunch prices can't really be beat (maybe $10 for 8 wings, celery & carrots and a side).  The service is "ok", though they never really seem particularly upbeat/happy to be there.

My one big negative for BWW is that they seem to skimp on the amount of sauce on the wings!</Text>

<user>110936213797482595101<//user><response>None</response><rating>1<//rating><name>D. Rose<//name><Review>I came here to post a bad review about the customer service and it looks like I wasn't the only one.

I placed the order at 7:11pm and it said it would be ready at 7:30 but it wasn't ready until 7:45 - ok a bit annoying but only because the rest of the interaction was incredibly bad!

I ordered buffalo chips with cheese (+$1) and when I checked my order only 2 maybe 3 chips max had cheese on them. So I told the waitress that they didn't really put cheese on them - and instead of saying oh we can add some more, she pointed out the 2 chips that had a bit of cheese on them. She didn't offer to fix the order and seemed really annoyed. So I just asked to return them.

The manager came and started to credit me and didn't say anything to me - not a word. So I asked him if he wanted to know why I wanted my money back and he reluctantly said yes. So I said there's no cheese on here and he said well these 2 chips have them and if you ordered a different type of cheese there would be more! (what the???) Only after counting the chips that had cheese and telling me I ordered the wrong one he said they could remake them and I said I didn't think that was an option from the way the waitress reacted, at this point she rolled her eyes at me and walked away. Such a bad experience and could have been fixed in a minute if they just said they could just add more cheese that I paid extra for.</Review><date>1558236932176< /date>< Pics>

We went there for wings, but realized their wings taste so dry and not fresh. We ended up enjoying macaroni cheese and beer. Fried sampler is very dry and overcooked. The whole experience got to worst that I have to smell some strong  chemical odors around our table. Sever and front people didn't even smile. But, I hope this isn't what buffalo wing I been at other location.< /Text>

The location is temporarily closed! Please double check before heading in!

Buffalo wild wings has been a wonderful chain for great wings and drinks. I've yet to yet any flavor that I've disliked.

The wings are quite juicy and flavorful! Blazin, mango habanero, asian zing and thai spicy has been my personal favorites...< /Text>

<text>Went yesterday to watch the start of the NFL season. About 30+ people waiting in the hostess area.... The kicker is there were about 40+ dirty tables that were vacant. I waited 30 minutes and not a single person was seated.

Ended up going to claim jumpers where they actually have the NFL package also. Buffalo needs new management.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Great wings, super crunchy boneless wings. There are TVs everywhere with two giants screens. Super crowded during game nights. Plan on arriving early to get decent spots. You have a view of a TV pretty much anywhere in the restaurant. The hot wings have a decent amount of kick to them. I prefer the lemon boneless wings<//review>

<GmapID>0x808fc76b4882a269:0x779a511bbae4cca2< /GmapID><review>I only go on Tuesdays, so this review is only for Tuesday nights... for the inexpensive wings. They are great. The onion rings are also the best I've had anywhere. But this is also when everyone else wants cheap wings, and this location has not figured out how to deal with the demand, especially when a game is on (it gets very loud too). Not sure who is to blame, but the wait time to be seated is about 30 minutes on average after 7pm, and after you order your food it takes another 30 minues to an hour for it to come out of the kitchen. Granted, they do warn you about the wait ahead of time. Ive started to order the wings to-go, and giving myself an hour before I leave to pick them up. It seems like many people have started doing this as well since the wait times for to-go orders have been increasing. Maybe some day they'll figure out a way to work the crowds. It's my favorite wing place! But make sure you have some time to spend.< /review><rate>4< /rate>< Response>

We always just go for the tuesday chicken wings deals. The environment is very lively especially when there is a game. It is a great place to go after a movie. The chicken wings are very good. I only get the mild ones and they are satisfying. Not to oily and not too salty. I recommend this place</review>

Terrible service! We left. There were 15 plus dirty tables and 15 plus people waiting for a table over 30 minutes on season opener for football.  The hostess was trying to work the front and clean tables.  We left after waiting 30 mins.  Short-handed and unorganized.< /text>

<Review>Fun place, opens late. We came here late. Got to try many of the wing flavors. We wanted to do the scorpion rum (hottest flavor) to go so we could have a challenge and try to finish it in 30 secs and loser pays. But they were out of that flavor... wth. All in all fun place to eat or watch sports too.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Went for a business lunch looking for a quick 1 hour bite mid afternoon. The server was slow and we spent almost 3 hours there. I usually go to Bdubs for 50 cent wings but since that's  only "franchise" restaurant promo and this location is a "corporate" they couldn't honor such promo. If they're not going to be consistent, I can't bring myself and team to eat at any of their locations. To have 2 split types of businesses with separate promos per location and isn't clarified online is outrageous.<//Review>< Pictures>

Great place to go watch any games, the food is good and so is the service, we had to wait for awhile just to get some ranch but I blame it on the management for not having more personnel working at a busy time, our waitress was very nice and tried to assist as soon as she was able to.</Text>

The wing sauces are very good. Most of the times the wings aren't cooked evenly. Half are okay, rest are overcooked rubbers. Beer selection is halfway decent. Usually too loud inside.</Review>

Second time here, came at 1AM.

Don't get the boneless chicken at this time. Easy to overcook.

The happy hour still applies, so it's not bad if you just want some beer and beer food.< /Text>

We went early to beat the crowds and had a group of 8. The food was subpar and the service was not the greatest. There was not many people at the restaurant but still our server was not around very often. When we asked the server for an extra plate to put some food on for a child we received a speech about how they do not give out extra plates or bowls but if we wanted a piece of wax paper they could do that. I was pretty shocked at this but ok no need to argue about this new learned rule. Wings, chicken tenders, burgers and salads is what they do and the food all tasted and looked like it was dumped out of a foster farms bag in the freezer and nuked for a couple minutes. To end our fantastic day at their establishment our server who we could not find at times took the time to calculate and hand write the percentages and tip amounts based on our bill on the check. I am assuming their registers do not have this capability and also she was just trying to help us from working the math out ourselves. Bravo buffalo wild wings for making sure I never return again.< /review>

This location is pretty inconsistent. Sometimes you have great servers other times not so much. My last visit to BBW my food came out cold and my waitress was barely paying attention to me. I had to ask for extra cheese for my nachos because they only have chips with a splash of cheese.</text>

Google shownhours at 2am

Walked in at 11:46pm..... was told I missed last call at 11:45pm.
.. not happy.. and no confession for 1 beer after being 1min late... and stuck here after a delayed and canceled flight!  Walked 1/2 mile from the Hawthorn Hotel where American Arilines put me.  Please update hours Google!  BTW.. it's a 45 degree temp walk! Not bad... except.. I live in Phx... so it was a pretty chilly walk!  Only reason for 3 stars is the bar tender convinced me that even only being 1 min late, the taps are computerized and shut off... oh.. and there are camers..... could be interpreted as BS.... bit I think she was being truthful.  So... it is corporate chain BS!</review>

We have never had such bad service I thought someone was playing a joke. It took almost an hour to correct check, waiter kept bringing different checks with food never ordered. Did not receive silverware or half of our groups drinks till 30 minutes after we were served our food.</Review>

Very slow service. We asked for a beer answer was "I'm not your sever". Waiter shows up after 15 minutes. Takes 20 minutes to get the beer delivered. Order is frequently messed up. We come here very frequently and service is consistently very slow.

Edit: Now they don't have utensils. We've been waiting for an hour now. They still haven't washed any.</text>

At this wild wings you get extra wings(feathers)on the wings .As i informed them ,they took out the old order and made new wings .even the second time i found feathers .this is rediculous ,as i spoke to the manager .manager responded very rude way. He said "we cant do anything .we will make wings until you dont get feathers "   . I felt really bad and paid the bill for drinks we had and left the place ....i will make sure will spread this as much as i can .<//Review>

<review>Couple of dislikes. Waiting for lady to take our order took longer than bringing out the food. Which was quite quick so no complaints there. Food was good. Only other dislike is that you can no longer get them in increments of 5 on boneless night; only 8 and 12 making sharing flavors difficult.</review>< pics>

<Review>Ridiculous! I ordered 10 boneless wings and the waitress ask if I would like a sauce with that. I go "sure ranch". And then after I had their sorry excuse for wings, I get a check with two sixty cent charges for sauce. Not a big loss but to charge me twice for it?

Had wings and veggies delivered via Doordash. I didn't expect the wings to be hot given traffic and distance to my home, but I did expect the veggies to be fresh- celery ends were brown and slimly.</review>

Food goo, always recommend the street tacos. It kind of took too long to get to us and the music was very loud to me. Great place to watch sports though, if you don't mind them being muted.<//review>

<response>None< /response><review>Thank you Arianna for the great customer service, I'm a believer that customer service is not only a job title but an attitude and Arianna is the definition of that, she has a beautiful smile and a fantastic attitude when it comes to customer service, she was very attentive checked on me frequently and friendly, she made my stay during dinner very pleasant. The facility is very nice and customer service team was great, the bathrooms are well maintained but I vote out the enchiladas wings, booo enchiladas seasoning is not meant to go on chicken wings, but other than that everything was great. I'll be a frequent customer to this location my business is earned, keep up the good work!</review>< Pictures>

Worst service ever experienced. Waiter Alyssa doesn't know how to treat customers. I don't know why they even run a business if they don't know how to respect customers. This is not a free food center, we pay for our food and we are disrespected. Shame on BWW. If any of the higher management is reading this, teach your staff how to treat customers with respect. I will never come back again.<//Text>

The food is pretty much always in the B- to B+ range, but that's fine with me. They also get BTN in HD here, which is harder than you'd think to find in bay area sports bars.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x808fc76b4882a269:0x779a511bbae4cca2< /Gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures><userid>100964406424233231915<//userid><response>None<//response><name>Tom McGhan<//name>< Date>

< review>
Very big fan of BWW, Florida has many in which i worked when i was younger, and frequented. Unfortunately the service and operation at this location is not on par with there standards. Servers take way too long to greet the customers, waited over 20 mins multiple times when visited to get a beer. One bar tender ean out after we paid and screemed in the parking lot that we didnt paywhen the cash was on the bar. very poor training in seems like.<//review>

Service was horrible, I waited about 5 min to be sitted and no one showed up at the front, the I walked myself to a table and waited for about other 20 min to get service, several servers walked by me several times and not a single one of them offered​ service, I finally ask one of them if there was service at the restaurant and she questioned me if anyone walked me to the table and acted like it was my fault. The table was dirty and when the server finally took my order she never cleaned it up.
Service was bad enough that I won't be coming back to this place<//text>

Avoid this location. Especially on lunch time they understaffed so takes for ever to get a server to take your order, bartender are not professional at all< /review>

<Review>The wait wasn't bad, but the rest was poorly executed. It took over 10 minutes to place our drink order, the water was tinted yellow, we never got napkins, silverware, or refills. We are still waiting to get our bill and it's been almost 30 minutes.</Review>< Response>

Great place and staff, but it is usually freezing in most of the seating areas which makes it uncomfortable if you forgot to bring a sweater. There’s also usually around a 30 min wait time on weekend afternoons.<//Review>

When I walked in with my friend, the receptionist is not very friendly to us, and when I inform her I would like to sit in table instead of bar table, she said can you just sit here first, but we never got switch to table(that's a lot of empty table), and we barely speak to our waiter.
I will never come to this location again, I will go to Hayward, for better service and good food</text>

Huge variety of wing flavors and beers, don't come here on the weekend or football nights because sports fans can act like real rude when they are drunk. It's more relaxing on the weekday<//review>

The quality of service at this restaurant is really falling apart here. The wings come out super dry, they charge you for everything and they take a long time. It was almost 40 mins before we got our food after we ordered. I was a huge fan. I'm really disappointed.< /text>

The  worst BWW I have ever visited. The waiters are so rude and I waited for almost 1hr to get a table. None of them are answering and mostly irrespectful.
Please make this place a better one.< /review>

"he's not gonna take off the other extra corona " which they charged wrongly , he's admitting waiter is correct and we 5 people are wrong ..and the other worst part we ordered an extra blue moon in the last ..manager has just taken off the beer from the table(totally ridicilous).. Manager name is Gremmey..it seems like  he don't  like his job and he said at us I don't want you guys to visit again .... Manager Gremmey , you better leave that job , you don't deserve to be an Restaurant Industry .. Your reckless words and attitude will impact BWW Business in further in Fremont area ...

<text>Surprisingly, my most recent experience at BWW greatly surpassed my expectations in terms of service. Our waitress was friendly and to be honest, I thought she was pretty cool. 4 minutes before happy hour ended, we reached out for her attention and told her we were trying to squeeze in our drink orders before happy hour ended, she understood fully and made it her mission. She came back with a grin on her face and told us we're set and then proceeded to take our orders. Not too long later, the food came out and she left us to it, checking up on us once or twice. "Do you guys need anything....*scans the table for a second* you need napkins!"

Her service alone deserves 5 stars, but if I'm being completely honest, the past couple times I've been here had subpar and spotty service. Not to mention, I'm really reviewing the food here right?

FOOD:
Boneless -- Extremely dry, tough pieces of chicken.. They weren't even warm. Nearly $10 for a snack size??? I could have bought a large bag from the grocery store and microwaved it for that price and it would still taste better.. Disappointing.

Traditional Wings -- It seemed like my friends really enjoyed their half off deal. $10 for a large size (20 pieces) of wings was not a bad deal.

Basket of fries -- the highlight of my meal personally... Seasoned with buffalo dry-rub and freshly fried, these were good. Unfortunately the spices built up in my mouth quickly and I was too *chicken* (hehe..) to continue my quest in finishing it. On the bright side, I REALLY enjoyed my Racer 5 IPA because of it.

BWW is a good place to catch up with friends over some drinks, but pick and choose your time wisely or you'll end up waiting a long time for a spot when you can just go elsewhere. Experience is entirely based on who you get as your waiter/waitress. Food is nothing special.< /text></record></dataset><record>

I visites this place with family and sat on the table 84, we have been served by the Employee called SHAHIL,very arrogant person with no smile and no great or atleast no return greet when offer.

Served the snacks without offerimg the plates, plates were given after 10 min of order arrived to table, no fillings like pepper salt on table.

He did his table work very rude and NO QUALITY AT ALL IN THE FOOD</text>

Today was my first experience at bww in pacific commons and it started off really horrible. Me and a friend were sat down on a very small table way in the corner by the bathrooms completely away from the crowd. A woman by the name of Cailey walked by as i grabbed her attention to switch our seating. She gladly sat me and my friend at her section and completely turned the rest of our experience around. She was a really great server hands down. She wasnt there all the time, but she was there when we needed attention and thats all that mattered.<//text>

Hard to believe that a "bar" would be out of beer, but tonight this place was out of most of the beers.  I wouldn't recommend going here.  This is the second time that this has happened to us.< /review>

I am a BWW regular, just not at this location.

Won't be coming here again. Service is bad. Yes bad. Slow waitresses, slow kitchen. And I was there early before the lunch crowd came in.

Wings are lukewarm when they get to your table. I ask for extra saucy wings as I always do, and they came to my table dry and I had to ask for more sauce.

I go to BWW very often, have not been to a location quite like this one. Management needs to do something. Food should be hot, service be attentive to the level other BWW's are. And fremont is a busy place and it kind of explains why this place is so empty even on Wing tuesdays.< /Text>

Been there a dozen times and each time my wife and I say why did we come back. From waiting 40 minutes for the nachos appetizer, messing up my order/my wife's order or running out of food. We've tried and tried to give it another chance. Will never go back.< /Review>

BWW is awesome as usual, with their boneless wings and the amount of choices that they give. We had Asian Zing, Mango Habarnero and Caribbean Jerk. It was quite heavy and satisfying. The passion fruit non-alcoholic beverage was quite refreshing too.< /review>

(Translated by Google) When we were there for the first time we were really disappointed because we had to wait forever. Then the waitress came and apologized and told us that a device in the kitchen was broken and unfortunately it takes longer. The food was very good and tasty as always and in the end we even got a discount because we had waited so long.
The next time we were there everything was fine again. We will be back.

(Original)
Als wir das erste mal da waren waren wir echt enttäuscht da wir ewig warten mussten. Darauf hin kam aber die Kellnerin und entschuldigte sich und erzählte uns das ein Gerät in der Küche kaputt sei und es leider länger dauert. Das essen war aber wie immer sehr gut und lecker und am Ende erhielten wir sogar noch einen Rabatt da wir so ewig gewartet hatten.
Als wir das nächste Mal dort waren war auch wieder alles gut. Wir kommen wieder.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) There was no tequila to make margaritas I ordered a sangria and they did not have red wine so I ordered a mojito ... and it turned out that there was no rum. I ordered some mozzarella cheese sticks they took as if they had cooked a steak well done and for the last cold ... the waitress stank of marijuana and all this adds that it took 15 minutes to assign me a table when the restaurant was empty dirty toilets .. .and place so most detestable. I will never come back ....

No habia tequila para hacer margaritas pedi una sangria y no tenian vino tinto entonces pedi un mojito ..y resulto que no habia ron.  Pedi unos  sticks mozzarela cheese tardaron como si hubiesen cocinado un filete well done y para el colmo frios ...la mesera apestaba a marihuana y ha todo esto agregale que tardaron 15 minutos en asignarme una mesa cuando el restaurante estaba vacio los baños sucios ...y lugar tan mas detestable.
